      "byline": "Simon Parker",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>It's said that many of the policies you've implemented since becoming finance and local government minister are based on those of your predecessors Frank McAveety and Jack McConnell. When do we start to see your policies coming through, and what will they be? What's your vision for Scottish local government? </strong></p> <p>Ministers don't have individual policies. We are delivering the Scottish executive's policies as an administration. Our objective for local government is that it should be highly valued by the consumers of its services and that these services should provide value for money and be competitive with services provided in any other sector. In terms of the delivery of these services, I think a mixed economy can have benefits - but my very clear preference is for public sector delivery. </p> <p><strong>The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) has been badly shaken by the string of councils that have recently pulled out or threatened to do so. Does the executive still think Cosla is a representative and important voice for local government? How will you deal with Glasgow now it has pulled out? Do you give any credence to the suggestion that the convention's recent troubles are partly due to an SNP conspiracy? </strong> </p> <p> No, because for many local authorities Cosla is a representative and important voice for local government. All authorities will be dealt with in the same way as before. In matters of collective importance to councils we will deal with Cosla, in matters of clearly local significance we will talk to individual authorities, as we have in the past. It's business as usual with a level playing field for all authorities and no special favours. </p> <p><strong>The issue of local government proportional representation (PR) in Scotland has been off the agenda recently, despite being in your partnership agreement with the Lib Dems. The coalition is already coming under strain over the fishing industry - can it survive what seems like an inevitable confrontation over PR? Are you a supporter of PR? </strong></p> <p>We recently published Working Together for Scotland, a document that committed us to continuing to make progress on electoral reform. We have a ministerial working group that is looking at a range of issues relating to local government. So, no policy area is being ignored - I don't think the Liberal Democrats would agree that PR has been off the agenda recently. In recent weeks we have seen some of the more serious stresses and strains that can come with systems that are not first past the post. What is critically important at this stage, is that the Scottish parliament demonstrates that an alternative system can be made to work well. </p> <p><strong>It's widely accepted that local government finance in England and Scotland is in need of reform. But you've been accused of fudging this issue, and you've got a Scottish parliamentary committee producing its own reform proposals. Is the three-year settlement and the abolition of spending guidelines as far as it goes - or have you got something else up your sleeve? If so, when might we see it? </strong> </p> <p>First, I'm not sure it is widely accepted that council finance is in need of reform. I know it's discussed in fairly specific places - not usually in general conversation though! I'm also not aware of having been particularly, or widely, accused of having fudged the issue. I welcome the parliament's local government committee carrying out an inquiry and I'm looking forward to cooperating with it.

      "bodyText": "It's said that many of the policies you've implemented since becoming finance and local government minister are based on those of your predecessors Frank McAveety and Jack McConnell. When do we start to see your policies coming through, and what will they be? What's your vision for Scottish local government? Ministers don't have individual policies. We are delivering the Scottish executive's policies as an administration. Our objective for local government is that it should be highly valued by the consumers of its services and that these services should provide value for money and be competitive with services provided in any other sector. In terms of the delivery of these services, I think a mixed economy can have benefits - but my very clear preference is for public sector delivery. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) has been badly shaken by the string of councils that have recently pulled out or threatened to do so. Does the executive still think Cosla is a representative and important voice for local government? How will you deal with Glasgow now it has pulled out? Do you give any credence to the suggestion that the convention's recent troubles are partly due to an SNP conspiracy? No, because for many local authorities Cosla is a representative and important voice for local government. All authorities will be dealt with in the same way as before. In matters of collective importance to councils we will deal with Cosla, in matters of clearly local significance we will talk to individual authorities, as we have in the past. It's business as usual with a level playing field for all authorities and no special favours. The issue of local government proportional representation (PR) in Scotland has been off the agenda recently, despite being in your partnership agreement with the Lib Dems. The coalition is already coming under strain over the fishing industry - can it survive what seems like an inevitable confrontation over PR? Are you a supporter of PR? We recently published Working Together for Scotland, a document that committed us to continuing to make progress on electoral reform. We have a ministerial working group that is looking at a range of issues relating to local government. So, no policy area is being ignored - I don't think the Liberal Democrats would agree that PR has been off the agenda recently. In recent weeks we have seen some of the more serious stresses and strains that can come with systems that are not first past the post. What is critically important at this stage, is that the Scottish parliament demonstrates that an alternative system can be made to work well. It's widely accepted that local government finance in England and Scotland is in need of reform. But you've been accused of fudging this issue, and you've got a Scottish parliamentary committee producing its own reform proposals. Is the three-year settlement and the abolition of spending guidelines as far as it goes - or have you got something else up your sleeve? If so, when might we see it? First, I'm not sure it is widely accepted that council finance is in need of reform. I know it's discussed in fairly specific places - not usually in general conversation though! I'm also not aware of having been particularly, or widely, accused of having fudged the issue. I welcome the parliament's local government committee carrying out an inquiry and I'm looking forward to cooperating with it. We have still got issues to consider - on reducing ring-fencing, the distinction between capital and revenue, on the relationship between economic development and non-domestic rating returns and on council tax collection rates, for example. You have a reputation for being a local government moderniser and your former council is now operating a cabinet. Do you support the executive's decision not to allow referendums for directly elected mayors (or provosts) in Scottish councils? Shouldn't people have the choice? Or do Scottish authorities not need this kind of reform? The key thing is to ensure councils have the kind of political structures that enable them to work best. In that context, there might be a place for elected mayors, but I am not aware of significant pressure from anywhere in Scotland to have this option available. Unison's strikes ended recently. What is the executive doing to make sure this kind of industrial action isn't repeated at the next pay round? It looks as though Unison's action did win them some gains in the end - is this an example of local government employers being held to ransom and giving in? Pay negotiations in local government are rightly a matter for unions and employees - not the executive. As to the terms of the agreement, I'm afraid you will need to ask the participants to the negotiations and agreement as to their views on the ultimate outcome. The executive has always had a very close relationship with Scottish local government. As the parliament develops and you have to start taking big decisions on issues such as PR and finance, do you think you can maintain those close ties? If the SNP wins control of more councils at the next election, will you be able to work with them constructively? Local government has a crucial role to play in post-parliament Scotland. It is the key vehicle for the delivery of so many of our policies and that is why a close and positive relationship must be maintained.

In fact, there are four weekends and two bank holidays between the two dates - as well as Maundy Thursday which for reasons of arcane electoral law does not count as a working day either. With Labour fearful of voter apathy and a low turnout that damages its prospects without a single defector to the William Hague-led Tories, it still leaves Mr Blair and his party rivals plenty of scope for tactical maneouvre. Crucial among those will be the exact date that Mr Blair emerges from No 10 to tell the waiting cameras that he is paying an unscheduled trip to Buckingham Palace - grinning as to what exactly he will ask the Queen to do. That ritual will probably occur on Thursday, March 29, on Friday or, as one Whitehall rumour has it, on Saturday, March 31. That last option is \"very remote\", some insiders said, because it would give Labour's diehard enemies in the nihilistic Sunday papers first bite at the campaign story.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair's hope of using this weekend's European Union economic summit in Stockholm to boost the efficiency of the European economy was dashed yesterday when France signalled its refusal to open its energy markets as Britain and Germany have done. The prime minister - whose electricity in Downing Street is supplied by a French firm - flies to the Swedish capital tomorrow night with Robin Cook and Keith Vaz, the embattled minister for Europe. They want to consolidate a range of liberalisation policies, including such \"real people issues\" as cheaper phonecalls, electricity and air fares. Also on the list are less expensive cars: Britain's own dealer cartel pushes up the average car price by 10%. Briefing reporters in Downing Street before the summit, senior officials brushed aside complaints yesterday by the European Round Table of Industrialists that the EU's programme of economic reforms, designed to catch up with US levels of competitiveness, was moving too slowly. Now that the US economy, so long the motor of world growth, is entering a slow-down or even a recession, EU leaders will show whether they can meet the challenge of global leadership by improving Europe's growth rates. But even as officials rattled off impressive statistics about falling prices to consumers in Europe - and held out the prospect of EU-wide recognition of qualifications for professionals and plumbers alike - the French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, was pouring cold water on an important British objective: opening up the energy sector. Mr Blair's spokesman said that for the first time one-third of France's notoriously protected electricity market was being opened to competition But, speaking in Brussels, Mr Jospin took issue with a 2005 deadline to fully liberalise the gas and electricity sectors, as proposed by the European commission. \"We think that the question cannot be put exclusively in terms of fixing early dates for liberalisation,\" he insisted after talks with the commission president, Romano Prodi. France's position puts it at odds with Britain and most other EU member states, which pledged at last year's \"dot.com\" economic summit in Lisbon to make Europe the \"most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world over the next 10 years\". Tony Blair wants the energy deadline brought forward to 2003. \"There will be quite a row about this,\" a senior diplomat predicted last night. Mr Blair may not be averse to that: a row in Stockholm might help him show he is standing up for Britain's interests - and its voters' cheaper utility prices - in the run-up to a general election campaign in which William Hague hopes to play the Euro-card. In Brussels, a British official said: \"Energy is a small part of the overall picture but it's something where we can make real progress and show that Europe is capable of delivering tangible value.\" Germany and Britain have already fully liberalised their energy markets, but France, where state-controlled firms dominate, has stuck to the EU law's minimum requirement that 30% of the electricity market must be open to supply by a foreign provider. The figure for gas is 20% . Mr Jospin's protectionism on energy and French support for a welfare-centred social agenda will put a damper on a summit already criticised for lacking a focused theme. Tony Blair wants to use Stockholm to show that Britain's concern for market reforms and greater flexibility - on which he outperformed the French at Lisbon and again at Nice - is setting the agenda in the EU. He has launched a series of bilateral initiatives to set a direction that emphasises job creation, competitiveness and social cohesion. There is even a plan for Europe-wide financial prospectuses to make it simpler to raise capital, especially venture funds. Results since Lisbon have been mixed. On the plus side, Europe has created 2.5m new jobs and its economy grew by almost 3.5% last year, its best performance in 10 years. Its growth this year has, at 3%, been projected to overtake that of the US, but a slowing world economy could prevent that. And many internal barriers remain in the union, where 14m people are still out of work : double the level of the US and Japan. Officials in Brussels say the single most important outcome of the next two days in Stockholm is likely to be agreement on financial services - crucial for capital markets and cheaper finance. Britain is pushing for an emphasis on skills and employability, as well as the key question of labour market mobility, allowing EU citizens to take their pensions anywhere in the union. Cutting red tape is another priority - a task where business organisations consider Brussels less than expert. France is likely to hit back at Britain by attacking its record on the liberalisation of postal services, another Lisbon target. Mr Blair has argued for the special rural needs for post offices. Likely diversions during the two-day summit include the crisis in Macedonia, BSE and the foot and mouth crisis for the livestock business, and meetings with an invited guest, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Sweden, the summit host, hopes the session with Mr Putin will be the start of a meaningful dialogue on economic and political issues, including plans to expand the EU to countries that used to be part of the Soviet Union or the Soviet bloc.",

      "body": "<p>Has the country ground to a halt, lights out, closed for business, a nation in deadly quarantine? Watching the nightly news, that is what townies and the world outside think, as reporters stand by burning pyres, intoning purple prose that would better suit the floods, fever and famine found aplenty among humans elsewhere. Mad reporter disease has seized the BBC as they stand in the few crisis areas wringing their hands in the flickering flames, stricken with a verbal dose of the Fergal Keanes.</p> <p>How bad is it out there? For the farmers waiting for slaughter or left with bloated dead cows for days before incineration, it is a disgusting disaster to live near. But this is not the plague. People are not dead. (The 79-year-old Devon farmer who drank near-lethal disinfectant out of fear his cattle might catch it, is in a stable condition. His family says he's been depressed since Christmas.)</p> <p>Is the countryside paralysed? Not really. No schools are closed, no country pubs shut, mail and milk is delivered everywhere. Smoke is not billowing from coast to coast. Pyres are hard to find, even in Cumbria where the tourist board and county council are outraged at the impression given that it is closed for business: it is not.</p> <p>Maff says fell-walking continues so long as rules are obeyed, lakes are open: travel from Carlisle to Keswick and you pass no smoke. Parts of south Dumfries, north Cumbria and a bit of Devon are badly affected, but elsewhere, Maff insists, life goes on, apart from small patches around an outbreak. Only 1% of the nation's livestock is affected - still minor compared with the same stage in the 1967 outbreak: 12 new cases a day now, 77 then. As for the reported \u00a39bn cost of this - it is the kind of nonsense figure thrown up in every crisis.</p> <p>All proportion and perspective has been lost. Everyone sympathises with farmers who lose precious blood-lines and have to start again in the midst of an agricultural recession. But they get full compensation. The tragedy is not on the scale of the 6,000 steel workers or the swaths of textile and car workers who have lost their livelihoods in the past year, for much the same reasons as the agricultural depression - high sterling and failing to join the euro. Those were one-day news stories, with no camera- grabbing fires to mark the moment. Unpaid mortgages and the silent drop from decent pay to a minimum wage is not telegenic.</p> <p>The latest annual agricultural figures have just been posted on the Maff website. They make interesting reading. Agriculture now accounts for just 0.8% of GDP. The total workforce is 2% and falling. As farmers cut costs, they shed 11% of paid farm workers last year, but in England and Wales land values have shot up 10.7% per hectare. In real terms, assets rose, while debts fell. Since 1995 farming has been in sharp recession - but that came after a rapid boom: it averages out at a 40% increase since 1990, not too bad. Meanwhile, the total subsidy farmers received last year was \u00a33.1bn - which is more than all subsidy for all other industries put together. Averages are unfair and there are some very poor struggling farmers, just as there are poor corner shopkeepers alongside rich supermarkets: while life is tough for marginal tenant farmers, the rich owner- farmers - who get most of the subsidy - saw their capital wealth grow hugely, again.</p> <p>Turn to the National Farmers Union website and there is today's impassioned plea from their leader: \"the prime minister is urged to give a glimmer of hope through the gloom\" in this \"soul-devouring crisis\" where many are \"suffering the torture of worrying where the disease will strike next\". \"Dark days are stretching ahead of farmers and many are at their wits end, not knowing how they are going to make ends meet.\" They demand more from the government: what is euphemistically called an \"adjustment\" to the sheep annual premium, \"a recovery package would at least to give farmers hope to carry on\", begging for a \"scheme to help farmers retire\". Retire? What of the other one third of pensioners who retire with no savings? Down on the farm they live by other rules, in which ordinary state benefits levels are not enough.</p> <p>Why, on top of compensation, do they expect more than anyone else? Why - even odder - does the government keep on doling it out? Since 1997 Labour has has shelled out \u00a31.2bn on top of the common agricultural policy (CAP), with another \u00a31.6bn promised from last October. If ever there was a prime example of the Tory view that subsidies corrupt and distort, it is in farming. Farmers do not insure against disasters like any other business because the state always compensates them for bad luck or bad farming. Maff itself admits there is considerable incentive to fraud in the subsidies - and it happens.</p> <p>CAP pays out for production, needed or not, so most goes to the big barley barons. But 20% could be diverted to environmental purposes instead - guarding hedgerows, coppices, forests and heathland, creating field margins for wild flowers, building dry stone walls and a countryside fit for townie tourists.

      "bodyText": "Has the country ground to a halt, lights out, closed for business, a nation in deadly quarantine? Watching the nightly news, that is what townies and the world outside think, as reporters stand by burning pyres, intoning purple prose that would better suit the floods, fever and famine found aplenty among humans elsewhere. Mad reporter disease has seized the BBC as they stand in the few crisis areas wringing their hands in the flickering flames, stricken with a verbal dose of the Fergal Keanes. How bad is it out there? For the farmers waiting for slaughter or left with bloated dead cows for days before incineration, it is a disgusting disaster to live near. But this is not the plague. People are not dead. (The 79-year-old Devon farmer who drank near-lethal disinfectant out of fear his cattle might catch it, is in a stable condition. His family says he's been depressed since Christmas.) Is the countryside paralysed? Not really. No schools are closed, no country pubs shut, mail and milk is delivered everywhere. Smoke is not billowing from coast to coast. Pyres are hard to find, even in Cumbria where the tourist board and county council are outraged at the impression given that it is closed for business: it is not. Maff says fell-walking continues so long as rules are obeyed, lakes are open: travel from Carlisle to Keswick and you pass no smoke. Parts of south Dumfries, north Cumbria and a bit of Devon are badly affected, but elsewhere, Maff insists, life goes on, apart from small patches around an outbreak. Only 1% of the nation's livestock is affected - still minor compared with the same stage in the 1967 outbreak: 12 new cases a day now, 77 then. As for the reported \u00a39bn cost of this - it is the kind of nonsense figure thrown up in every crisis. All proportion and perspective has been lost. Everyone sympathises with farmers who lose precious blood-lines and have to start again in the midst of an agricultural recession. But they get full compensation. The tragedy is not on the scale of the 6,000 steel workers or the swaths of textile and car workers who have lost their livelihoods in the past year, for much the same reasons as the agricultural depression - high sterling and failing to join the euro. Those were one-day news stories, with no camera- grabbing fires to mark the moment. Unpaid mortgages and the silent drop from decent pay to a minimum wage is not telegenic. The latest annual agricultural figures have just been posted on the Maff website. They make interesting reading. Agriculture now accounts for just 0.8% of GDP. The total workforce is 2% and falling. As farmers cut costs, they shed 11% of paid farm workers last year, but in England and Wales land values have shot up 10.7% per hectare. In real terms, assets rose, while debts fell. Since 1995 farming has been in sharp recession - but that came after a rapid boom: it averages out at a 40% increase since 1990, not too bad. Meanwhile, the total subsidy farmers received last year was \u00a33.1bn - which is more than all subsidy for all other industries put together. Averages are unfair and there are some very poor struggling farmers, just as there are poor corner shopkeepers alongside rich supermarkets: while life is tough for marginal tenant farmers, the rich owner- farmers - who get most of the subsidy - saw their capital wealth grow hugely, again. Turn to the National Farmers Union website and there is today's impassioned plea from their leader: \"the prime minister is urged to give a glimmer of hope through the gloom\" in this \"soul-devouring crisis\" where many are \"suffering the torture of worrying where the disease will strike next\". \"Dark days are stretching ahead of farmers and many are at their wits end, not knowing how they are going to make ends meet.\" They demand more from the government: what is euphemistically called an \"adjustment\" to the sheep annual premium, \"a recovery package would at least to give farmers hope to carry on\", begging for a \"scheme to help farmers retire\". Retire? What of the other one third of pensioners who retire with no savings? Down on the farm they live by other rules, in which ordinary state benefits levels are not enough. Why, on top of compensation, do they expect more than anyone else? Why - even odder - does the government keep on doling it out? Since 1997 Labour has has shelled out \u00a31.2bn on top of the common agricultural policy (CAP), with another \u00a31.6bn promised from last October. If ever there was a prime example of the Tory view that subsidies corrupt and distort, it is in farming. Farmers do not insure against disasters like any other business because the state always compensates them for bad luck or bad farming. Maff itself admits there is considerable incentive to fraud in the subsidies - and it happens. CAP pays out for production, needed or not, so most goes to the big barley barons. But 20% could be diverted to environmental purposes instead - guarding hedgerows, coppices, forests and heathland, creating field margins for wild flowers, building dry stone walls and a countryside fit for townie tourists. Poor farmers should get more subsidy to do this work. But, frightened of the big boys, Labour only dares divert 2.5% away from unwanted production into environmental subsidies, though even France diverts its full 20% from production. Perhaps it is because farmers own three quarters of Britain's land mass that they mesmerise the nation. Whether it is the Countryside Alliance on the hoof, fuel protesters in tractors, new demands for extra compen sation, or slow-hand claps for the chief vet, they lack any idea of how they look to the rest of the nation. Nightly watching them weep over animals destined to be eaten, cuddling lambs reared for mint sauce is bizarre. William Hague says: \"The rural way of life is under threat from urban values, Islington pressure groups and a metropolitan elite who know nothing of the countryside.\" Well, the view from Lambeth (in my case) is that we are learning a great deal more about the countryside than we did. The louder they shout for more, the closer we examine what they get already - and how they farm. On average country-dwellers are healthier, happier, safer, better educated and richer than urban-dwellers.

Way out in front was George Soros, who gave a whopping \u00a3100m. All the other donors combined could not match him. Together they gave a paltry \u00a375m.</p> <p>For once it may be centrally relevant that Soros was not born in this country. For the billionaire financier has a distinctly non-British attitude to philanthropy. He gives like an American. There, the wealthy are much less shy about their generosity. On the contrary, they positively revel in it. That's why the Chronicle of Philanthropy can publish its annual \"Most Generous\" list, in which America's billionaires jostle for top spot by giving ever vaster sums to charity.</p> <p>Number one this year, as always, is Bill Gates and wife Melinda, whose personal foundation is now worth $21bn. Gates says he wants to give almost all his eye-popping fortune away in his lifetime, and to that end he has hired his father to spend his billions on good works - chiefly on world health, from Aids to malaria. His best-known rival is CNN founder Ted Turner who also likes the grand gesture, including one $1bn gift to the United Nations.</p> <p>This is just the way Americans do things - and always have. Turner and Gates are the heirs of the Mellons, Carnegies and Rockefellers: super-rich families who dedicated as much energy to giving away their wealth as to earning it. It's telling that one of Britain's most reliable benefactors is John Paul Getty: an American.</p> <p>The US charitable habit is partly rooted in religious tradition but also in the country's approach to government. An unspoken contract exists: the rich are taxed lightly and, in return, they make a hefty contribution through philanthropy. Proof that the attitude lives on has come recently with the billionaires' rebellion against George W Bush and his $1.6 trillion tax cut. They don't like the president's proposal to abolish inheritance duty. Gates Snr, Warren Buffett and the rest of the Croesus club reckon such a move would create a new, unAmerican aristocracy of wealthy kids who haven't earned their fortunes for themselves. But the billionaires also insist that any tax cuts should be aimed at the poor, not them; and that abolishing estate duty will remove the current, tax-avoiding incentive for the rich to give their fortunes away to charity before they die.</p> <p>This is not the ethos of our rich. And yet it should be. For thanks to Thatcherism and its successors, Britain's rich are not taxed heavily either. Like Americans, and unlike Europeans, they are allowed to keep much more of their own money. But while they grab this side of the American bargain -low taxes - they don't seem too keen on the other. They take the tax break but won't give the charity.</p> <p>Now might be a good time to start asking the rich to cough up. For one thing, there are more of them - with 200,000 millionaires in Britain now, twice the 1996 number. Add to that this week's Guardian expos\u00e9 of the rundown state of our national infrastructure - including universities, which could do with a dash of US-style generosity from their most affluent alumni. And tomorrow the prime minister will report on the state of social exclusion in Britain - the teen parents, school truants and homeless youngsters. Across the ocean, society's most blessed would see those problems as a personal responsibility they should meet. Here they sit back and count their money - leaving a few comedians to squeeze pennies from the poor.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",

That's why the Chronicle of Philanthropy can publish its annual \"Most Generous\" list, in which America's billionaires jostle for top spot by giving ever vaster sums to charity. Number one this year, as always, is Bill Gates and wife Melinda, whose personal foundation is now worth $21bn. Gates says he wants to give almost all his eye-popping fortune away in his lifetime, and to that end he has hired his father to spend his billions on good works - chiefly on world health, from Aids to malaria. His best-known rival is CNN founder Ted Turner who also likes the grand gesture, including one $1bn gift to the United Nations. This is just the way Americans do things - and always have. Turner and Gates are the heirs of the Mellons, Carnegies and Rockefellers: super-rich families who dedicated as much energy to giving away their wealth as to earning it. It's telling that one of Britain's most reliable benefactors is John Paul Getty: an American. The US charitable habit is partly rooted in religious tradition but also in the country's approach to government. An unspoken contract exists: the rich are taxed lightly and, in return, they make a hefty contribution through philanthropy. Proof that the attitude lives on has come recently with the billionaires' rebellion against George W Bush and his $1.6 trillion tax cut. They don't like the president's proposal to abolish inheritance duty. Gates Snr, Warren Buffett and the rest of the Croesus club reckon such a move would create a new, unAmerican aristocracy of wealthy kids who haven't earned their fortunes for themselves. But the billionaires also insist that any tax cuts should be aimed at the poor, not them; and that abolishing estate duty will remove the current, tax-avoiding incentive for the rich to give their fortunes away to charity before they die. This is not the ethos of our rich. And yet it should be. For thanks to Thatcherism and its successors, Britain's rich are not taxed heavily either. Like Americans, and unlike Europeans, they are allowed to keep much more of their own money. But while they grab this side of the American bargain -low taxes - they don't seem too keen on the other. They take the tax break but won't give the charity. Now might be a good time to start asking the rich to cough up. For one thing, there are more of them - with 200,000 millionaires in Britain now, twice the 1996 number. Add to that this week's Guardian expos\u00e9 of the rundown state of our national infrastructure - including universities, which could do with a dash of US-style generosity from their most affluent alumni. And tomorrow the prime minister will report on the state of social exclusion in Britain - the teen parents, school truants and homeless youngsters. Across the ocean, society's most blessed would see those problems as a personal responsibility they should meet. Here they sit back and count their money - leaving a few comedians to squeeze pennies from the poor. jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday took the extraordinary step of offering what amounted to a blank cheque to struggling rural communities when it promised to match every pound donated by the public to ease the plight of farmers and their neighbours. Michael Meacher, environment minister, made the pledge as part of a multi-million pound package designed to restore tourism in stricken areas - and some unaffected ones which have overreacted - as well as easing the cashflow problems of small rural businesses hurt by the foot and mouth outbreak. In his Commons statement the minister did not put a total cost on the package, nor say specifically what charities and voluntary bodies would benefit from the matching funds. He did say the Prince of Wales's \u00a3500,000 gift, matched already by the Duke of Westminster, would be counted. The Rural Stress Network, under pressure since the outbreak, the Samaritans and Action for Communities in Rural England, are among those to benefit. Privately officials later included even the \u00a32.1m so far raised by readers of the Daily Mail, possibly a shrewd move which might neutralise the anti-Labour propaganda use which the flagship Tory tabloid has made of the crisis. Tens of thousands of small businesses will benefit from the government's package and rate relief, initially a Tory suggestion, will run into tens of millions of pounds, officials conceded. \"It is going to be demand-led on a case by case basis,\" officials said. A telephone helpline, with \"significant manpower\", is to be set up this week to advise tourists where they can safely go. An advertising campaign, starting tomorrow, will hammer home the message - telling people not to go near livestock, but to go anywhere safe. \u0095 The foot and mouth outbreak will not stop the census being conducted on schedule throughout England and Wales next month, the chief national statistician said yesterday. About 63,000 volunteers had been due to hand deliver census forms to every home on April 29 as part of the national statistical stocktaking con-ducted every 10 years. Len Cook, the national statistician, said the \u00a3225m project would go ahead with special arrangements for the handover of forms at farm boundaries, or by post.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair is poised to defy growing public concern over the foot and mouth crisis by pressing ahead with his planned May 3 general election despite mounting Tory attacks and a new Guardian poll indicating that a majority of voters now believe the campaign should be postponed. The ICM poll confirms a hardening of the sudden swing in opinion against a May election in the last 10 days, with 52% of voters saying the election should be postponed and only 40% saying it should go ahead.

A multimillion pound aid package for businesses affected by the outbreak, drawn up by the Rural Task Force, included a government pledge to match public donations made to ease \"rural distress\". Officials confirmed that the sum involved - effectively a blank cheque - would run into millions, including match funding for the Prince of Wales and Duke of Westminster's donations of \u00a3500,000 apiece, and the \u00a32.1m raised by the Daily Mail. There will also be rate relief for small businesses in local authorities in areas worst hit by the crisis, which will total tens of millions of pounds, as well as permission for councils to defer payment of business rates. The government is planning a national advertising campaign explaining which areas are safe to visit and stressing the benefits tourists can bring to the countryside. English Heritage and the National Trust are to reopen 350 properties between now and April 1, British Waterways will begin opening canals next week, and local councils and the national parks will consider which footpaths should now be opened. Downing Street also announced plans to recruit more vets, license five more rendering plants to deal with carcasses, reduce the time vets have to be quarantined between farm visits and hold discussions centred on a central tariff for animal valuations to speed up slaughter. While the Guardian poll showed opposition to a May election edging over 50%, opinion does split along predictable party lines with a majority of Labour voters urging Mr Blair to go ahead now and Conservative and Liberal Democrat supporters urging postponement. If there were a general election tomorrow on the voting intentions shown in the poll, Mr Blair would be back in Downing Street with a majority of around 145. ICM's \"variometer\", which takes account of regional differences in swing, estimates that Labour would return 402 MPs, the Conservatives 201, the Liberal Democrats 27, and the nationalist parties 10.

About 63,000 volunteers had been due to hand deliver census forms to every home on April 29 as part of the national statistical stocktaking conducted every 10 years. There were fears that this could not be done without breaking restrictions on movement in the infected areas or reducing the validity of the census by exempting hard hit parts of the country. Len Cook, the national statistician, said the \u00a3225m project would go ahead with special arrangements for the handover of forms at farm boundaries, or by post. Census day will come four days before May 3, widely assumed to be Tony Blair's favourite date for a general election, disease restrictions permitting. Mr Cook said: \"Census takers working in the countryside will respect all foot and mouth restrictions, whether statutory or otherwise imposed. \"I am conscious of the distress and difficulty the disease is causing, and we shall do nothing that might contribute to its spread. \"Census enumerators are local people, working in local communities, in local conditions\". He said that new arrangements were being put in place so that census forms could be delivered by post or at farm boundaries. \"Census takers are being instructed to be flexible in arranging the delivery of forms. On no account will they use taped-off thoroughfares or pass warning signs.

      "bodyText": "William Hague yesterday raised the stakes in the political manoeuvring behind the foot and mouth crisis when he insisted a general election could not be held when the disease remained \"out of control\". The Conservative leader's direct challenge to the government, backed up with calls for plans for the delay of county council elections in worst hit areas, marks a calculated but risky shift to the offensive for the Tories after several weeks maintaining a political consensus over the handling of the outbreak. Party strategists believe that, while Labour shows every sign of pressing ahead with a May 3 general election, public feeling that the contest should be postponed is growing. The mounting seriousness of the crisis, in the face of unpopular efforts at containment, now offers scope for an assault on government handling of the epidemic, even at the risk of being accused of making political capital out of the problem, Mr Hague's aides have concluded. The Tories have been, and remain, wary of making any direct suggestion that the election should be postponed amid fears of being perceived to be running scared of a battle polls indicate they will lose badly. Mr Hague yesterday stopped short of calling for postponement - or even demanding the delay of county council elections - but he attempted to set down a marker that, without a clear easing of the crisis, calling an election campaign would be irresponsible. Avoiding giving a definition of what would constitute the disease being \"under control\", he insisted his party would not be frightened to speak out if it felt the government was calling an election in inappropriate circumstances. Yesterday's statement marks the culmination of a gradual Tory move towards risking a direct attack on the government election plans. Initially, the party steered clear of any such suggestions, while simul taneously allowing other sympathetic voices - the National Farmer's Union, the Countryside Alliance and Conservative supporting newspapers - to make the case instead. Last week, shadow agriculture spokesman, Tim Yeo, stressed that the party was ready for an election fight whenever the government chose to call one, but suggested that voters would question the appropriateness of a poll amid a crisis affecting not only farmers but a swath of rural and tourist industries. Addressing Cumbrian farmers last Thursday, Mr Hague argued that it would be \"very difficult\" to hold an election if the foot and mouth situation remained as it was - a warning strengthened yesterday to a clear statement that, without an easing of the crisis, it would not be right to call an election. Conservative strategists insist they are not reducing the party's room for manoeuvre by opposing a poll. A Hague aide said: \"We are not boxed in at all. On the day Blair announces the election we could say we agree the outbreak has been contained, or we could say we completely deplore this decision, the outbreak is not under control. All those options are still open to us.\" Labour yesterday swung into action to counter Mr Hague's offensive, as the Commons leader, Margaret Beckett, accused him of trying to make political capital out of the crisis, despite the Tories' officially bipartisan policy. She said: \"In situations like this, there are ways of making constructive criticism without so obviously trying to turn it into a political issue. Many of the points he makes are already being addressed.\" Trades union leaders were also mobilised to send out a coordinated message that postponing local elections -used as Labour code for the unannounced general election - would send out a panic message and further damage the rural economy and jobs. John Edmonds, leader of the GMB which has over 20,000 members in the tourism sector, said: \"Cancelling the local elections would be the worst possible move. \"We are trying to restore confidence in the UK as a tourist destination and effec tively suspending democracy would send a signal to the world that we are a nation in crisis.\" Conservative county councillors and some election officials in worst hit areas raised concerns over council elections, however. Cattle and sheep farmer Steele Addison, a Tory councillor representing Lowther and Shap, near Penrith, Cumbria, said yesterday: \"I think at the present time most certainly as we see this thing expanding so rapidly across the Cumbria countryside, it would be silly to think in terms of elections. \"We cannot go electioneering at a time like this. It is inappropriate.\" The West Devon borough council chief executive, David Incoll, said it seemed likely that many of the village halls normally used as polling stations in elections would not be available on May 3. \"We will do whatever we have to do, but I think there would be concern as to holding the election in certain village halls in the most affected areas,\" he told BBC Radio 4.

Belgium and Greece are the EU's most xenophobic countries, and more hostile towards the idea of a multicultural Europe than anyone else. In the UK 23% of those questioned in the survey of more than 16,000 Europeans commissioned by the centre a year ago said political asylum seekers who had suffered human rights violations in their own countries of not be accepted. The survey found that 39% of those questioned thought legal immigrants who became unemployed should be forcibly repatriated, and 51% believed that ethnic minorities increased unemployment. Although the report shows an increased in tolerance since the previous survey in 1997, it reveals that many Europeans are seriously concerned about the implications of mass immigration. It classes 27% of Greeks and 25%of Belgians as intolerant, compared to 4% of Spaniards. \"People are more and more looking for scapegoats ... and are worried about the effects of migration,\" Beate Winkler, the centre's director, said. She added that Greek social security, jobs and schooling had been particularly affected by the wars in the Balkans. More than half the Greeks disagreed that it was a good thing for a society to be made up of different races, religions and cultures, as did 35% of Belgians. \"The statistics show that Europe needs immigrants and we have to prepare our populations for that,\" Ms Winkler said, adding that politicians were failing to promote the benefits of immigration.",

      "bodyText": "Ministers are at the point of underwriting next year's Commonwealth Games in Manchester after a warning from Tony Blair that the event must succeed in portraying Britain as a world leader in staging prestige international gatherings. Amid growing concern over the financing of the games, which still need \u00a332m to meet sponsorship targets, the prime minister has ordered a far higher level of government commitment - both political and financial - than was ever envisaged when Manchester bid for the games in 1995. Manchester's council tax payers still remain technically liable for any losses. But yesterday Ian McCartney, the Cabinet Office minister given special responsibility for the games by Mr Blair last year, told the Commons culture select committee meeting in Manchester that there was now \"a far more close relationship between central government and those who deliver the games\". With fewer than 500 days to go before the opening ceremony, government spending is now seen as an investment in a showcase rather than a potential bail-out, although no indication has been given of the level of spending that may be required. Mr Blair has supported the games with a series of breakfast meetings and receptions and has also featured in a promotional video. But it is a sign of his increasing interest that Granada chief, Charles Allen, who is chairman of Manchester 2002 Ltd, is personally presenting him with regular reports on the finances and organisation. Ministers were influenced by three factors in their decision to strengthen commitment to the games. The Sydney Olympics set new standards by which international events will be judged; the Commonwealth Games are a key element in the celebrations of the Queen's golden jubilee (\"They are the jewels in the crown,\" said Mr McCartney); and London is gearing up for a bid for the 2012 Olympics. A further impetus may have been the political fallout from the shambles over two London projects - the dome and Wembley stadium - which have damaged Britain's international reputation. \"The Commonwealth Games are here and going to happen so we must make them successful,\" said Mr McCartney after yesterday's hearing. \"That success will give us the capacity for the first time in a long time to go to the market place and say: 'We are quite good at this kind of event. We have a track record here'. \"That's what we don't have at the moment - a track record in truly global events.

Ministers and games organisers are now working on a review to discover gaps in planning and funding shortfalls. \"The review is not taking place on the basis that there is a crisis,\" said Mr McCartney. \"Far from it. This is an organisation that is in control of events but needs to make sure that it remains in control of events, the logistics and the funding, over the last 500 days.\" The minister's robust stance was welcomed by games organisers. \"This is a national project and we have always believed it was national project,\" said Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester city council. \"This is a legitimate event for a government to spend its money on.\" There are even suggestions that spending might rise above previous budgets to meet the expectations set by Sydney. \"We are the Commonwealth Games and not the Olympics but people's view of how we do things is influenced by what they saw at Sydney, where the games had far more impact on the world than any recent Olympics,\" said Frances Done, chief executive of M2002, the company responsible for the organisation of the Manchester games. \"They got through to people about what you do and how you do it.

Speaking in the wake of the row over his \"foreign land\" speech, the Tory leader said that Muslims had promoted values of faith and responsibility since they first settled in Britain in the 16th century. Opening his speech to the Muslim Council of Britain with the Islamic saying \"peace be with you\", Mr Hague said that Tories and Muslims shared the values of hard work and support for the family. \"Your values of strong faith, education, responsibility to others, of hard work and tolerance are values which resonate with all our citizens in every part of this country,\" Mr Hague said. He announced that he had appointed Mohammed Riaz, who is standing for the Tories in Bradford West, as an adviser to the shadow cabinet on ethnic and cultural issues. Tory sources denied that Mr Hague's remarks were designed to mend fences after his warning earlier this month that a Labour election victory would turn Britain into a \"foreign land\". They said his remarks at the party's spring conference in Harrogate were about the threat posed by the EU and were not about race.",

So far teachers in 10 areas in England have voted to take so-called \"no cover action\".Ballots are being held in eight other areas. The results of ballots in Derbyshire and Birmingham are due next month.</p> <p>Only two schools in England say they have been forced to send children home in the last two weeks, although more would be affected if the action continued.</p> <p>The schoolteachers' review body recommended in its report on teachers' pay and conditions last month that there should be an independent evaluation of teachers' workload, but the government ignored the recommendation until yesterday.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: \"If no action were taking place, we would of course be willing to respond positively to the STRB's recommendation that there be an independent evaluation of teachers' workload ... The secretary of state will only take part in such discussions with the unions on this issue once the action is called off.\"</p> <p>Earlier, Graham Lane, the education chairman of the Local Government Association, which represents local education authority employers, wrote to union leaders asking them to suspend the industrial action so that talks could start.</p> <p>He said the overtime payments could be introduced immediately. The assocation believed an independent inquiry would be unnecessarily time-consuming, and instead proposed talks with ministers after the election for \"a comprehensive agenda\" covering teachers' working arrangements.</p> <p>Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"At long last the government has admitted there is a crisis. We will look positively at the substance of both proposals from the employers and government.\"</p> <p>Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: \"The unions have waited for 15 years for talks on teachers' contracts so obviously we take the government's offer very seriously.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "An end to the bitter dispute over staff shortages in schools was in sight last night, after the government and local authority employers said they were willing to start negotiations with the teaching unions provided they called off the action. The education secretary, David Blunkett, intervened by offering an independent review of teachers' workload, while in another significant concession, the Local Government Association said teachers could for the first time be paid overtime of up to \u00a320 an hour if they covered for colleagues. Leaders of the two unions involved, the National Union of Teachers and the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said they would consider both proposals at executive meetings today and tomorrow. They welcomed the offers as a breakthrough which could represent the first steps towards \"an improved contract\" for teachers. Pupils have faced being sent home from school when their teachers have refused to cover for staff illness of longer than three days or long term vacancies. So far teachers in 10 areas in England have voted to take so-called \"no cover action\".Ballots are being held in eight other areas. The results of ballots in Derbyshire and Birmingham are due next month. Only two schools in England say they have been forced to send children home in the last two weeks, although more would be affected if the action continued. The schoolteachers' review body recommended in its report on teachers' pay and conditions last month that there should be an independent evaluation of teachers' workload, but the government ignored the recommendation until yesterday. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: \"If no action were taking place, we would of course be willing to respond positively to the STRB's recommendation that there be an independent evaluation of teachers' workload ... The secretary of state will only take part in such discussions with the unions on this issue once the action is called off.\" Earlier, Graham Lane, the education chairman of the Local Government Association, which represents local education authority employers, wrote to union leaders asking them to suspend the industrial action so that talks could start. He said the overtime payments could be introduced immediately. The assocation believed an independent inquiry would be unnecessarily time-consuming, and instead proposed talks with ministers after the election for \"a comprehensive agenda\" covering teachers' working arrangements. Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"At long last the government has admitted there is a crisis. We will look positively at the substance of both proposals from the employers and government.\" Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: \"The unions have waited for 15 years for talks on teachers' contracts so obviously we take the government's offer very seriously.\"",

      "body": "<p>Melanie Zaalof was in a police station in central Birmingham when it hit her. \"I was doing a work placement there when a call came in to rescue a five-year-old girl who was at risk in a house nearby,\" the 18-year-old A-level student recalls. \"It took exactly two hours and fifteen minutes of filling out forms and filing papers before the officers could go and rescue that girl. And I just thought - that's not right. It can't be.\"</p> <p>But drowning in paperwork is only one of many reasons why Zaalof and her fellow students at Bournville secondary school in Birmingham baulk at the prospect of life in the public services. For Douglas Brown, the 17-year-old son of two teachers, it was the dawning realisation that working in the classroom was much like being a nightclub bouncer that did it. \"Three-quarters of the time it's just crowd control,\" he says. \"No wonder so many people get so disillusioned with it.\"</p> <p>At least nightclub bouncers get free drinks. There is nothing scientifically representative about Bournville, of course, but it is as good a snapshot of late-teenage Britain as any: an ethnically diverse urban comprehensive with a larger than average intake of below average pupils - popular with parents, rated good and improving when the Ofsted inspectors last called. </p> <p>Here, if anywhere, is where the next generation of doctors and nurses, teachers and police officers, civil servants and air traffic controllers must be found. But if they are thin on the ground - and they are - it is not for the reason that might be expected. Money, in fact, is almost never mentioned. </p> <p>It may be a timeless commonplace that each generation is more selfish than the last, bored by the pride in serving the community that supposedly quickened their parents' hearts - but it isn't true. When Bournville's 16- to 18-year-olds shun public-sector careers, they are not rebelling: they are following the advice of parents who took those jobs themselves and now dread their children doing the same. </p> <p>\"My dad is living proof for me, a living deterrent never to become a teacher,\" says one 16-year-old, an aspiring actor, echoing a widespread view. \"He thought he could do it for five years, then quit, but by then he'd got a mortgage. He comes home every day regretting his decision, and now he's stuck with it until he retires. He doesn't want me to get trapped like that.\"</p> <p>Hillcrest School, down the road from Bournville, has an arguably even more important role to play in the current recruitment crisis in the public services: it is an all-girls state school, and 80% of workers in the sector are women. There are some old-fashioned gripes among older students here - bureaucracy, lack of appreciation, too much routine - but one prevalent objection is of much more recent origin. </p> <p>\"You're constantly in the public eye and at risk of ending up in the papers - this doctor's done that, this teacher's done this, this nurse has done that,\" says Hayley-Jayne Kellerman, 16, who - despite everything, and seemingly uniquely - wants to teach maths (her academic father, needless to say, would rather she entered the world of finance). </p> <p>\"My stepmother's a pathologist, and after the organ scandals they came in, opened all the morgues, looked through all the files - it was just too much stress for her.

      "bodyText": "Melanie Zaalof was in a police station in central Birmingham when it hit her. \"I was doing a work placement there when a call came in to rescue a five-year-old girl who was at risk in a house nearby,\" the 18-year-old A-level student recalls. \"It took exactly two hours and fifteen minutes of filling out forms and filing papers before the officers could go and rescue that girl. And I just thought - that's not right. It can't be.\" But drowning in paperwork is only one of many reasons why Zaalof and her fellow students at Bournville secondary school in Birmingham baulk at the prospect of life in the public services. For Douglas Brown, the 17-year-old son of two teachers, it was the dawning realisation that working in the classroom was much like being a nightclub bouncer that did it. \"Three-quarters of the time it's just crowd control,\" he says. \"No wonder so many people get so disillusioned with it.\" At least nightclub bouncers get free drinks. There is nothing scientifically representative about Bournville, of course, but it is as good a snapshot of late-teenage Britain as any: an ethnically diverse urban comprehensive with a larger than average intake of below average pupils - popular with parents, rated good and improving when the Ofsted inspectors last called. Here, if anywhere, is where the next generation of doctors and nurses, teachers and police officers, civil servants and air traffic controllers must be found. But if they are thin on the ground - and they are - it is not for the reason that might be expected. Money, in fact, is almost never mentioned. It may be a timeless commonplace that each generation is more selfish than the last, bored by the pride in serving the community that supposedly quickened their parents' hearts - but it isn't true. When Bournville's 16- to 18-year-olds shun public-sector careers, they are not rebelling: they are following the advice of parents who took those jobs themselves and now dread their children doing the same. \"My dad is living proof for me, a living deterrent never to become a teacher,\" says one 16-year-old, an aspiring actor, echoing a widespread view. \"He thought he could do it for five years, then quit, but by then he'd got a mortgage. He comes home every day regretting his decision, and now he's stuck with it until he retires. He doesn't want me to get trapped like that.\" Hillcrest School, down the road from Bournville, has an arguably even more important role to play in the current recruitment crisis in the public services: it is an all-girls state school, and 80% of workers in the sector are women. There are some old-fashioned gripes among older students here - bureaucracy, lack of appreciation, too much routine - but one prevalent objection is of much more recent origin. \"You're constantly in the public eye and at risk of ending up in the papers - this doctor's done that, this teacher's done this, this nurse has done that,\" says Hayley-Jayne Kellerman, 16, who - despite everything, and seemingly uniquely - wants to teach maths (her academic father, needless to say, would rather she entered the world of finance). \"My stepmother's a pathologist, and after the organ scandals they came in, opened all the morgues, looked through all the files - it was just too much stress for her. The majority is judged by the minority.\" But even the traditional benefits of public sector work, such as relative job security, seem unattractive now. The anchorless insecurity of the new economy may have its losers - thousands of late-shift call-centre workers for every internet millionaire - but seeking the stability of a public service job seems like a kind of defeatism: an admission that one didn't even try to be a winner. \"Our generation is predicted to change career four times during our lives,\" says 18-year-old Seema Parmar. \"I don't want to look back on my life and see that I went into a job because it was safe and stayed there forever.\" \"You're going to spend most of your life doing it, so it might as well be meaningful,\" says Tom Willshire at Bournville. \"I'm told that the job I want will mean forget having girlfriends, forget having a regular place to live or anything like that, for years, but I'm happy to make that sacrifice.\" There are pockets of enthusiasm for public service, mostly among those who say they would be teachers or hospital staff for almost any money, because they can never remember having wanted to do anything else.

      "body": "<p>You're not going to mug us, are you?\" asks Chris Connop, spokesman for the United Grand Lodge of England. He is evidently worried on this point, as he asks the question half a dozen times. He also looks suspicious when the photographer starts grovelling around on the floor of the grand temple at Freemasons Hall, an art deco masterpiece in central London and the masons' HQ. \"I don't like being photographed from below,\" he explains. \"It makes me look sinister.\" The photographer becomes agitated and utters an expletive, which may be the first swearword ever uttered in freemasonry's most hallowed hall. </p> <p>Connop is paranoid because mugging has become an occupational hazard for freemasons. He is fuming over Monday's Newsnight, which made great play of the bizarre initiation rites undertaken by aspiring masons, and by an article by the son of a mason in the Independent portraying freemasonry as \"the perfect hobby for bored middle-aged men engaged in undemanding jobs who hanker for a faintly exotic social life\". </p> <p>The freemasons hope this is the dark media hour just before a golden dawn. They are tired of being traduced, and have appointed a PR agency called MDA to re-present them to a doubting public. The doubts have been put most forcibly by Martin Short, author of The Brotherhood, who argues that the heavy concentration of masons in the law and the police force perverts justice. \"Can all the rituals be merely symbolic?\" asks Short. \"One must presume that people join lodges predominantly to feather their own nests, and to form a loose combination against the interests of everybody who is not a mason.\" </p> <p>Short did battle on Newsnight with Mike Dewar, head of MDA and a former colonel whose 30 years in the army has left its mark in the way he describes everything in military terms. He is preparing a campaign on behalf of freemasonry; it will be a battle, and initially the masons may have to take some flak, but a couple of years on he reckons our ideas of freemasonry - and our presumption that it is secretive, sinister and self-interested - will have been changed. </p> <p>\"The freemasons feel defensive at the moment,\" says the brisk, pinstripe-suited Dewar. \"They feel they've been pressured. They've been attacked and vilified for so long that every reaction is a defensive reaction - 'No, we're not going to do that; as a matter of principle we won't publish lists of members.' I hope that in two years' time, when this campaign starts to be successful, they'll be a lot less sensitive about that sort of thing. They're not per se secretive about being a mason; in fact they're happy to sing about it, and that's what I'm encouraging them to do.\" </p> <p>Dewar is not a mason and says he prefers not to know what goes on at initiation ceremonies (sharp instruments placed against bared breasts, silken nooses placed around the heads of initiates). \"I couldn't care a damn what the ceremony is,\" he says. \"That's not what's important. What is important is that these people are extremely good people; well-meaning, upright people with high moral standards. They are a fraternal society whose aim is to make good men better, and their achievements speak for themselves. They collect massive sums of money for charity - \u00a317m last year - and most of the money goes to non-masonic charities.\" </p> <p>Others have been less willing to ignore the rituals that are an integral part of freemasonry. In 1996, in an article in this paper, Short attacked the penalties which he said initiates agreed to accept if they transgressed against a brother mason: \"having my throat cut across, my tongue torn out by the root and buried in the sand of the sea at low water mark\". And that, said Short, was only the penalty for \"first-degree\" masons, the so-called entered apprentices in their Persil-white aprons. Second-degree (or fellowcraft) transgressors faced having their hearts \"torn from their breasts and fed to ravenous birds\", while third-degree (or master mason) miscreants faced the ultimate penalty, being severed in two, their bowels burned to ashes, and those ashes \"scattered over the face of the earth and wafted by the four winds of heaven.\" </p> <p>Short, however, had not been reading the extremely useful Freemasons' Diary, which explains that these hideous penalties have fallen into disuse. \"When masonic ritual was developing in the late 1600s and 1700s,\" it explains soothingly, \"it was quite common for legal and civil oaths to include physical penalties, and freemasonry simply followed the practice of the times. After long discussion, they were removed from the promises in 1986.\" </p> <p>I asked for clarification from Jim Daniel, grand secretary of the United Grand Lodge. \"The physical penalties, which were always only symbolic, were removed from the obligations in 1986,\" he says. \"They were not replaced, so that a candidate still makes his obligation in the certain knowledge that he will be 'branded as a wilfully perjured individual void of all moral worth and totally unfit to be received into this worshipful lodge or any other warranted lodge or society of men who prize honour and virtue above the external advantages of rank and fortune' if he violates his obligation.\" So no ravenous birds or ritual disembowelling, but you certainly won't be welcome at lodge suppers. </p> <p>The rest of the ritual remains intact, and the masonic diary defends it as a \"shared experience which binds the members together\", posing a crucial question to itself in its Q&amp;A explanation of freemasonry - \"Why do grown men run around with their trousers rolled up.\" Its answer is unembarrassed: \"It is true that candidates have to roll up their trouser legs during the three ceremonies when they are being admitted to membership. Taken out of context this can seem amusing, but like other aspects of freemasonry, it has a symbolic meaning.\" (Irritatingly, it doesn't explain what it symbolises.) </p> <p>Masons are sensitive to the charge that they owe their primary allegiance to their \"craft\". \"Freemasons do not swear allegiances to each other or to freemasonry,\" says my masonic diary. \"Freemasons promise to support others in times of need, but only if that support does not conflict with their duties to God, the law, their family or with their responsibilities as a citizen.\" </p> <p>Connop becomes agitated at the suggestion that masons would put their masonic commitments before their worldly duties. \"We are not allowed to go around giving masonic signals [there are secret handshakes, passwords and signs] outside a masonic context, because if we did we could be thrown out,\" he insists. \"I'm a magistrate and if I were sitting as a magistrate and somebody tried to give me one of the degree signs, I would say immediately what was going on if I was in the chair. If not, I would say to the chairman, 'I'm sorry but this defendant is trying to gain advantage by his membership of freemasonry,' and I would retire from the bench and not hear that case. That is outrageous. That is not what we stand for.\" </p> <p>The hardest thing for an outsider to grasp is what freemasonry is actually for. Connop, who is a member of no fewer than 13 lodges, supplies a one-word answer: \"fun\". He enjoys the ritual, and opens his mason's case to show us his numerous medals, aprons and masonic ties. He is heading off that evening to the lodge of which he is master to \"make a mason\" - induct an apprentice into the craft - and is palpably looking forward to it, rehearsing the lines which form part of ceremony. He values the moral compass that freemasonry provides in his life and is moved when he shows us the masonic artefacts that soldiers carried with them in the first world war, but above all he wants to stress the enjoyment and sense of fellowship he derives from being part of the organisation. </p> <p>The Real Secrets of Freemasonry, a guide to the craft prepared by Worshipful Brother George Gibson in 1945 and much reprinted since, takes a more moralistic stance. \"Freemasonry is an organised system of morality . . . derived from divine wisdom and age-long experience, which for preservation from outer assault and inner decay is veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols. It preaches the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man. The influence of divine inspiration is with it throughout. Each Candidate for membership declares his belief in the Supreme Being: keeping strictly aloof from political divisions, it demands from its members a recognition of the eternal and of the light which comes from above.\" </p> <p>So what is the essence of freemasonry? Material self-advancement and sinister secrecy, say its critics. Fun, fellowship and a moral code, masons counter. Dewar, who hopes to reverse the decline that has seen membership in England and Wales fall to 320,000, intends to present them as \"good, solid citizens with the right moral values who support all that is good in society\". But there are two other factors which must surely be considered - food and stamp collecting. </p> <p>The editor of The Square, \"the independent magazine for freemasons\", devotes his editorial in this month's issue to the important question: \"To eat or not to eat\". \"Any masonic group which sought to eliminate my choice of whether I dine or not can do without my presence,\" he thunders in a vigorous defence of the \"festive board\" against the \"Nazis of the masonic world\" who want it reduced or eliminated. It is, he explains, \"one of the big topics of conversation in masonic circles\". What does Martin Short think of that? </p> <p>I also scanned the small ads in The Square for sinister cabals looking for masons to join their ranks. The Logic Ritual Association, the Goose and Gridiron Society, the London Lunchtimers, the International Masonic Poetry Society . . . bodies to make the flesh creep. And, scariest of all, the Masonic Philatelic Club, based in Cleveland, \"open only to masons in good standing of the English Constitution and recognised Grand Lodges\". There is an article in The Square about the stamps of Belgium (remarkably, it is part four in a series on Belgian stamps). I assume that encoded within these apparently innocent words on Belgian politician-freemasons is a sinister message to the philatelists of Cleveland. You have been warned.</p>",

And, scariest of all, the Masonic Philatelic Club, based in Cleveland, \"open only to masons in good standing of the English Constitution and recognised Grand Lodges\". There is an article in The Square about the stamps of Belgium (remarkably, it is part four in a series on Belgian stamps). I assume that encoded within these apparently innocent words on Belgian politician-freemasons is a sinister message to the philatelists of Cleveland. You have been warned.",

      "bodyText": "The minister for Europe, Keith Vaz, is to face a fresh inquiry into his alleged links with the Hinduja Foundation. A complaint was sent to the Commons standards and privileges committee after newspaper reports that the billionaire buisnessmen gave money through their foundation to a company whose directors include Mr Vaz's wife and mother. Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary standards commissioner, today wrote to the Tory shadow cabinet office minister, Andrew Lansley, to tell him that he would investigate his complaint. The Sunday Times disclosed last weekend that in 1995 the foundation had paid nearly \u00a31,200 to Mapesbury Communications, a company set up by Mr Vaz. The money helped to pay for an Indian spiritual leader's visit to the Commons. Mr Lansley referred the matter to Ms Filkin because Mr Vaz had previously told her he had never received any financial support from the Hindujas. A report on an earlier investigation by Ms Filkin into Mr Vaz's conduct as an MP last week cleared the Leicester East MP of all but one of the charges against him. The Commons standards and privileges committee recommended no action against Mr Vaz, but criticised him for failing to cooperate fully with the commissioner. Mapesbury was initially set up to handle income from Mr Vaz's extra-parliamentary activities, but its purpose has since changed and he now has no formal link with it. Mr Vaz is due to accompany the prime minister, Tony Blair, to a European summit in Stockholm on Friday.

I would be extremely uncomfortable with having a stranger in our home who would be a distraction for my daughter. I am unable to understand why some parents allow their teenagers to rule them.

Parents may think their child isn't old enough to take this step but, if she's determined to do it, she'll do it anyway. I think that the most important thing is to protect your child. When my oldest daughter was 17, her boyfriend more or less moved in with us. I wanted to know what was going on in her home life, and if it's in your home then you do know.

If I felt my child was confident in the relationship and mature enough to cope with the situation, then I would let them go ahead. If my child was going to take this step anyway, I would want to make them feel as comfortable and protected as possible. As long as they had both thought the whole thing through, and were not entering into the arrangement lightly, they would get my support. <br><strong> Verdict: Yes </strong> </p> <p><strong>Dorit Braun: Director of Parentline Plus and mother </strong><br> </p> <p>It depends on a parent's own attitudes towards sex and sexual relationships, and how you have discussed sex with your child and whether there are younger siblings in the family. How big your house is and how many bathrooms you have is also a factor. Parents of teenage children are perpetually struggling to get access to their own bathroom as it is. If a child is going to enter a relationship, many parents would prefer them to do so in a safe and comfortable environment rather than sneaking away. I would feel comfortable with this arrangement. <br><strong> Verdict: Yes </strong> </p> <p><strong>Navin Shah: Architect and father </strong><br> </p> <p>I wouldn't reject the proposal. First of all, I would like to sit down with both of them and ask why they wanted to do this. It's a big decision and I would want to point out all the pros and cons to them. I think it is important that the whole family gets involved in discussing an issue like this. If I felt that they were both committed to each other and had good reasons for wanting to live together, I would support them. The advantage of having them live with us would be that, if problems arose, they may accept parental help and. If they were hell-bent on doing this, to resist would be counter-productive. <br><strong> Verdict: Yes </strong> </p> <p><strong>Lyndon Bowring: Chair of Christian Action, Research &amp; Education </strong><br> </p> <p>Mick Jagger's concern for protection, and expressions of love towards his children are admirable. However, allowing or encouraging these two young people to move in together in a family home is neither a protective nor, ultimately, a loving thing to do. I am sure that his motives are good, but I fear that this is a decision he will live to regret. My own teenage children have chosen to imbibe my values that sex is a special gift and worth waiting for when you meet the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. We ought to give teenagers more support to resist the pressure to have sex so young. <br> Verdict: No</p>",

If my child was going to take this step anyway, I would want to make them feel as comfortable and protected as possible. As long as they had both thought the whole thing through, and were not entering into the arrangement lightly, they would get my support. Verdict: Yes Dorit Braun: Director of Parentline Plus and mother It depends on a parent's own attitudes towards sex and sexual relationships, and how you have discussed sex with your child and whether there are younger siblings in the family. How big your house is and how many bathrooms you have is also a factor. Parents of teenage children are perpetually struggling to get access to their own bathroom as it is. If a child is going to enter a relationship, many parents would prefer them to do so in a safe and comfortable environment rather than sneaking away. I would feel comfortable with this arrangement. Verdict: Yes Navin Shah: Architect and father I wouldn't reject the proposal. First of all, I would like to sit down with both of them and ask why they wanted to do this. It's a big decision and I would want to point out all the pros and cons to them. I think it is important that the whole family gets involved in discussing an issue like this. If I felt that they were both committed to each other and had good reasons for wanting to live together, I would support them. The advantage of having them live with us would be that, if problems arose, they may accept parental help and. If they were hell-bent on doing this, to resist would be counter-productive. Verdict: Yes Lyndon Bowring: Chair of Christian Action, Research &amp; Education Mick Jagger's concern for protection, and expressions of love towards his children are admirable. However, allowing or encouraging these two young people to move in together in a family home is neither a protective nor, ultimately, a loving thing to do. I am sure that his motives are good, but I fear that this is a decision he will live to regret. My own teenage children have chosen to imbibe my values that sex is a special gift and worth waiting for when you meet the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. We ought to give teenagers more support to resist the pressure to have sex so young. Verdict: No",

      "body": "<p>When my baby was about two weeks old, my mother and her sister came to lunch. I showed them round our new house and the garden and we sat down to eat the soup and salad my mother had brought. When I started breastfeeding Sam after lunch, they both got up without a word and left the room. Soon I could hear them in the room above, discussing the paintwork and colour scheme. They had taken themselves on another lengthy tour of the house, acting as though they had not seen it all less than an hour before. </p> <p>I asked my aunt, who has four children, if any of them had been breastfed. She had tried with the first, she said, but gave up after a few days. \"It doesn't seem to have done any of them any harm,\" she added briskly. </p> <p>A week or so later, I was alone with my mother at her house, and settled down on the sofa after lunch to feed the baby. As the cups of coffee grew cold in front of me, I wondered where my mother was. Eventually, I found her out in the garden, weeding the roses and waiting for me to finish. </p> <p>Occasionally, her disapproval was even more explicit. When the baby was six weeks old and I rang her feverish with mastitis, she retorted: \"Get him on the bottle!\" One day when his face was covered in spots, she said spitefully: \"It's his diet.\" </p> <p>I used to wonder at the intense activity of the breastfeeding lobby. Best for baby, the literature insisted, best for you. Leaflets, lectures, classes, support groups, all hammering home the message that if you don't breastfeed your baby, you are a bad mother, your child's immune system will be rubbish, and you'll never get your figure back. Then I found out what the \"breast is best\" campaigners were up against. Once my baby was born, I encountered the full force of the anti-breastfeeding camp, in all its disgusted, put-it-away squeamishness - in the person of my mother. </p> <p>When such powerful disapproval comes from the one person you rely on to give you child-rearing advice, it's a severe blow. Whatever your rapport with your mother has been, when you have a child, the relationship is suddenly polarised in an intense new way: you do need her help and support and you do want her to think you're a good mother. </p> <p>She, meanwhile, has a chance, especially if she is a housewife and her daughter has a career, to prove that she knows a thing or two. The \"we didn't do it like that in my day\" attitude reveals far more than a change in childcare fashions. It usually lays bare a seam in your relationship with your mother that, if it isn't to undermine your confidence, needs to be laid bare, however painfully, and examined. </p> <p>Janet Reibstein, a psychologist, says: \"What happens to mothers when you have a baby is a reproduction of your own mothering. As you nurture and breastfeed your own child, the mirror image happens to your mother: it's such a powerful moment, it ensnares everyone, and you become a baby for her again. This shared experience can be a bond, but if it's a tender spot, it can feel like an attack. She might feel, 'I can be a mother again, I can teach you how to do it,' and if you don't take her advice, you're invalidating her.\" </p> <p>My mother says she started off breastfeeding her first baby for a few weeks, but found it \"too limiting\": \"Just after I'd had Emily, I went to a party: I seem to remember I nipped home to feed her and then went back to the party.\" </p> <p>She belonged to a social world in which nothing is fun without a martini in one hand and a cigarette in the other, and anyone who gave up either during pregnancy was just being a bore. Evidently, she succumbed to the social pressure to pretend that having children shouldn't spoil your fun. </p> <p>She took great pride in the fact that, for most of her pregnancy, she didn't look pregnant. In her photograph album, there is a picture of her and my father on holiday in the south of France, taken just over a month after my birth. My sisters and I were left at home with a nanny. It's not that my mother hadn't wanted children, it's just that we were not supposed to change her lifestyle. </p> <p>And now she expects the same of me. While my partner and I were ensconced in our blissed-out, totally domestic existence during the baby's first month of life, our friends joked about daytime TV, while my mother kept asking whether we had seen anything good at the theatre. </p> <p>This generation of mothers appals her, and it's not just our tendency to breastfeed, willy nilly. In her day, she tells me, babies were put in their prams and left in the garden. They might cry, but they would stop eventually, and anyway they were out of earshot. </p> <p>\"He'll get the upper hand!\" she scolded, when Sam was no more than a week old, and I scooped him up, bleating and red-faced, from his basket. \"He's got you wrapped around his little finger!\" </p> <p>A friend of my mother's, a woman at least 10 years her senior, shed some light on this rather harsh attitude to parenting. I was sitting with Sam slumped asleep on my shoulder while we drank tea and chatted. The old lady said: \"It's so nice that you have him with you so much of the time. We used to be told to put them down in the next room as soon as we'd fed them, and not to go near them again for four hours. Isn't that sad?\" </p> <p>\"The childcare bible after the war said you had to feed your baby every four hours and you were not to pick it up if it cried,\" says Reibstein, author of The Family Through Divorce. \"That was the rule. It made a lot of people uncomfortable. Your mother had feelings about you that you have about your son. But she was told, 'No: children have to be subdued, they have a strong will.' She learned things that countered her mothering instincts. If your mother was tyrannised by the four-hour regime and sees her own daughter doing the complete opposite, she feels she's being attacked.\" </p> <p>Now the fashion in childcare has changed, it pains some women of my mother's generation to see younger mothers relishing the physical comfort of a wriggly, sweet-smelling new baby, whenever they want to. </p> <p>My mother frequently expresses the view that there is something wrong with women who cuddle their babies excessively and, worse, that it is bad for the child. \"If you're beastly to your child in the early years,\" she always said, \"it will turn out very well behaved.\" </p> <p>When my eldest sister had children, I saw how strict my mother was with them and realised that what I thought had been said in jest, was actually in earnest. My sister's children, who were boisterous and outspoken and, if they wanted something, expected to get it, were considered outrageously spoilt. </p> <p>Eva Figes, a grandmother at 68, remembers when she had her children, she was kept in hospital for days - as all new mothers were - told to feed the babies every four hours and not to pick them up. \"I never obeyed the rules; I couldn't bear it. When I got home from hospital, I was in very limited accommodation and I couldn't get out of earshot, so there was no question of leaving them to cry. </p> <p>\"My father told me I was spoiling them, that I gave in to my son too much. And I did. I was taught to be terribly respectful to my parents, but I let my children say what they felt. </p> <p>\"As a grandmother it's a gift, it's your last chance. You're thinking, 'My life's closed off, my children are middle aged,' then there's this new life. I don't mind the children being spoiled - it's not my problem. As a grandparent the one thing you must not do is interfere in the way your children bring up their children. I would never, never say, 'You shouldn't do that,' unless they ask.\" </p> <p>The arrival of her daughter's baby brought them together, but not immediately. \"She had been quite rebellious up to that point and then we got closer. She knew she needed help and she asked for it. She suddenly noticed that I was very good with small children.\" </p> <p>As many new mothers know, asking for help when you've already been criticised is very hard. But it would be wrong to leave it at that. For Janet Reibstein, the arrival of a new baby is a pivotal moment in the relationship between mother and daughter. \"It's a moment that can be binding. If she can respect you for the way you bring up your baby, it's a decisive moment. It can produce a sort of healing, can make a connection with your own mother, and create empathy between you.\"</p>",

When such powerful disapproval comes from the one person you rely on to give you child-rearing advice, it's a severe blow. Whatever your rapport with your mother has been, when you have a child, the relationship is suddenly polarised in an intense new way: you do need her help and support and you do want her to think you're a good mother. She, meanwhile, has a chance, especially if she is a housewife and her daughter has a career, to prove that she knows a thing or two. The \"we didn't do it like that in my day\" attitude reveals far more than a change in childcare fashions. It usually lays bare a seam in your relationship with your mother that, if it isn't to undermine your confidence, needs to be laid bare, however painfully, and examined. Janet Reibstein, a psychologist, says: \"What happens to mothers when you have a baby is a reproduction of your own mothering. As you nurture and breastfeed your own child, the mirror image happens to your mother: it's such a powerful moment, it ensnares everyone, and you become a baby for her again. This shared experience can be a bond, but if it's a tender spot, it can feel like an attack. She might feel, 'I can be a mother again, I can teach you how to do it,' and if you don't take her advice, you're invalidating her.\" My mother says she started off breastfeeding her first baby for a few weeks, but found it \"too limiting\": \"Just after I'd had Emily, I went to a party: I seem to remember I nipped home to feed her and then went back to the party.\" She belonged to a social world in which nothing is fun without a martini in one hand and a cigarette in the other, and anyone who gave up either during pregnancy was just being a bore. Evidently, she succumbed to the social pressure to pretend that having children shouldn't spoil your fun. She took great pride in the fact that, for most of her pregnancy, she didn't look pregnant. In her photograph album, there is a picture of her and my father on holiday in the south of France, taken just over a month after my birth. My sisters and I were left at home with a nanny. It's not that my mother hadn't wanted children, it's just that we were not supposed to change her lifestyle. And now she expects the same of me. While my partner and I were ensconced in our blissed-out, totally domestic existence during the baby's first month of life, our friends joked about daytime TV, while my mother kept asking whether we had seen anything good at the theatre. This generation of mothers appals her, and it's not just our tendency to breastfeed, willy nilly. In her day, she tells me, babies were put in their prams and left in the garden. They might cry, but they would stop eventually, and anyway they were out of earshot. \"He'll get the upper hand!\" she scolded, when Sam was no more than a week old, and I scooped him up, bleating and red-faced, from his basket. \"He's got you wrapped around his little finger!\" A friend of my mother's, a woman at least 10 years her senior, shed some light on this rather harsh attitude to parenting. I was sitting with Sam slumped asleep on my shoulder while we drank tea and chatted. The old lady said: \"It's so nice that you have him with you so much of the time. We used to be told to put them down in the next room as soon as we'd fed them, and not to go near them again for four hours. Isn't that sad?\" \"The childcare bible after the war said you had to feed your baby every four hours and you were not to pick it up if it cried,\" says Reibstein, author of The Family Through Divorce. \"That was the rule. It made a lot of people uncomfortable. Your mother had feelings about you that you have about your son. But she was told, 'No: children have to be subdued, they have a strong will.' She learned things that countered her mothering instincts. If your mother was tyrannised by the four-hour regime and sees her own daughter doing the complete opposite, she feels she's being attacked.\" Now the fashion in childcare has changed, it pains some women of my mother's generation to see younger mothers relishing the physical comfort of a wriggly, sweet-smelling new baby, whenever they want to. My mother frequently expresses the view that there is something wrong with women who cuddle their babies excessively and, worse, that it is bad for the child. \"If you're beastly to your child in the early years,\" she always said, \"it will turn out very well behaved.\" When my eldest sister had children, I saw how strict my mother was with them and realised that what I thought had been said in jest, was actually in earnest. My sister's children, who were boisterous and outspoken and, if they wanted something, expected to get it, were considered outrageously spoilt. Eva Figes, a grandmother at 68, remembers when she had her children, she was kept in hospital for days - as all new mothers were - told to feed the babies every four hours and not to pick them up. \"I never obeyed the rules; I couldn't bear it. When I got home from hospital, I was in very limited accommodation and I couldn't get out of earshot, so there was no question of leaving them to cry. \"My father told me I was spoiling them, that I gave in to my son too much. And I did. I was taught to be terribly respectful to my parents, but I let my children say what they felt. \"As a grandmother it's a gift, it's your last chance. You're thinking, 'My life's closed off, my children are middle aged,' then there's this new life. I don't mind the children being spoiled - it's not my problem. As a grandparent the one thing you must not do is interfere in the way your children bring up their children. I would never, never say, 'You shouldn't do that,' unless they ask.\" The arrival of her daughter's baby brought them together, but not immediately. \"She had been quite rebellious up to that point and then we got closer. She knew she needed help and she asked for it. She suddenly noticed that I was very good with small children.\" As many new mothers know, asking for help when you've already been criticised is very hard. But it would be wrong to leave it at that. For Janet Reibstein, the arrival of a new baby is a pivotal moment in the relationship between mother and daughter. \"It's a moment that can be binding. If she can respect you for the way you bring up your baby, it's a decisive moment. It can produce a sort of healing, can make a connection with your own mother, and create empathy between you.\"",

She found that for two years the Tory leader had been incorrectly claiming that all speaking fees he earned were directed through the \"William Hague charitable trust\" to deserving causes in his Richmond constituency. In fact, the trust had never been set up. However, Ms Filkin recommended no action be take against Mr Hague as the entries were recorded \"in good faith\" and entries were not intended to be misleading. There was no evidence of \"irregularity or impropriety\" in the uses the fees were put to, she added. But she said: \"Mr Hague failed to respond correctly on eight separate occasions when required to check his entry, with the result that it continued in a materially inaccurate form for a considerable period - at least six months and arguably longer.\" In December 1999, Mr Hague was also censured by the commissioner for not declaring the free use of Jeffrey Archer's gym for his daily judo sessions with his aide, Seb Coe. The Labour MP, Fraser Kemp - who made the complaint to the standards and privileges committee after the oversight was exposed on the Mark Thomas Product, a Channel 4 comedy show, - demanded that the Conservative leader make an apology to the Commons at today's prime minister's questions.

He said he did not believe credit should be taken away from the Sunday Times's Insight team. \"I'm not saying it's savoury but all newspapers use sources or intermediaries,\" said Mr Kavanagh, who is arguably the most influential of Fleet Street political journalists. \"The only difference between these and Benjamin Pell is he is now a public figure. \"We've got an entire network of people, whether it's politics, sport, showbusiness or whatever.\" Mr Kavanagh said scoops were a joint effort on the part of a newspaper and its sources and, ultimately, it was the bylined writer - not the mole - who should receive an award. However, he conceded: \"it does rather detract from the purity of the story\". Meanwhile, Philippa Kennedy, the editor of trade magazine Press Gazette and organiser of tonight's awards, said she was confident the story had nothing to do with Mr Pell. \"I don't think the allegations in today's Guardian affect the awards in any way because the story is a good one. \"I have had [deputy editor] Martin Ivens from the Sunday Times on to me this morning and they have utterly denied it came from Pell,\" she said. But Ms Kennedy said even if the story had come from Mr Pell, it would not affect whether the story was worthy of being branded a \"scoop\". \"Let's say Pell found evidence of the prime minister's wife being a Russian spy; would you refuse to run the story because the information had come from a bin? \"We are not changing the shortlist in any way - firstly, because the Sunday Times has denied the involvement of Pell and, secondly, because the trophy is already inscribed.\" She joked the only way Mr Pell would gain an award was if a trophy was dropped and binned. The antics of Mr Pell, who makes a living by going through the dustbins of politicians and celebrities, have been behind a number of high-profile Fleet Street scoops. He was the subject of a recent documentary on Channel 4, which followed a protracted legal wrangle. Invoices seen by the Guardian suggest Mr Pell has received more than \u00a33,375 in a single month from the Sunday Times.

      "bodyText": "William Hague yesterday raised the stakes in the political manoeuvring behind the foot and mouth crisis when he insisted a general election could not be held when the disease remained \"out of control\". The Conservative leader's direct challenge to the government, backed up with calls for plans for the delay of county council elections in worst hit areas, marks a calculated but risky shift to the offensive for the Tories after several weeks maintaining a political consensus over the handling of the outbreak. Party strategists believe that, while Labour shows every sign of pressing ahead with a May 3 general election, public feeling that the contest should be postponed is growing. The mounting seriousness of the crisis, in the face of unpopular efforts at containment, now offers scope for an assault on government handling of the epidemic, even at the risk of being accused of making political capital out of the problem, Mr Hague's aides have concluded. The Tories have been, and remain, wary of making any direct suggestion that the election should be postponed amid fears of being perceived to be running scared of a battle polls indicate they will lose badly. Mr Hague yesterday stopped short of calling for postponement - or even demanding the delay of county council elections - but he attempted to set down a marker that, without a clear easing of the crisis, calling an election campaign would be irresponsible. Avoiding giving a definition of what would constitute the disease being \"under control\", he insisted his party would not be frightened to speak out if it felt the government was calling an election in inappropriate circumstances. Yesterday's statement marks the culmination of a gradual Tory move towards risking a direct attack on the government election plans. Initially, the party steered clear of any such suggestions, while simul taneously allowing other sympathetic voices - the National Farmer's Union, the Countryside Alliance and Conservative supporting newspapers - to make the case instead. Last week, shadow agriculture spokesman, Tim Yeo, stressed that the party was ready for an election fight whenever the government chose to call one, but suggested that voters would question the appropriateness of a poll amid a crisis affecting not only farmers but a swath of rural and tourist industries. Addressing Cumbrian farmers last Thursday, Mr Hague argued that it would be \"very difficult\" to hold an election if the foot and mouth situation remained as it was - a warning strengthened yesterday to a clear statement that, without an easing of the crisis, it would not be right to call an election. Conservative strategists insist they are not reducing the party's room for manoeuvre by opposing a poll. A Hague aide said: \"We are not boxed in at all. On the day Blair announces the election we could say we agree the outbreak has been contained, or we could say we completely deplore this decision, the outbreak is not under control.

Cattle and sheep farmer Steele Addison, a Tory councillor representing Lowther and Shap, near Penrith, Cumbria, said yesterday: \"I think at the present time most certainly as we see this thing expanding so rapidly across the Cumbria countryside, it would be silly to think in terms of elections. \"We cannot go electioneering at a time like this.

      "bodyText": "Traditional techniques at local abattoirs linked to small-scale butchers led to the deaths of five people in the Leicestershire village of Queniborough from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the official public health report into the cluster said. Dr Philip Monk, consultant in public health for Leicestershire health authority, said small slaughterhouses in the area had used a recognised technique involving inserting something into the brain to ensure cows did not kick out during the slaughter process. However, because it was \"plausible\" that herds in the area were infected with BSE, this technique led to infected material leaking to other parts of the animal. Dr Monk said: \"These were traditional craft butchering practices carried out by people who were experts in their tradition. None of them were illegal. They were both legal and crafted processes that were going on in the 1980s.\" He added: \"The people who had vCJD were exposed to the BSE agents through the consumption of beef which had been processed from butchers where there was a risk of cross-contamination of bovine brain material during the boning and cutting process in those butchers premises where the skull was split to remove the brain.\" The report into Britain's first cluster of deaths from vCJD revealed that a series of coincidences in the way the meat was prepared was responsible for the disease. The study looked at farming methods and food supplies in the area between 1980 to 1991, the period of time in which all five victims lived in the area. The investigation was launched in July last year and a progress report in November indicated that lines of inquiry had been narrowed and were concentrating on the meat supply chain as \"the only remaining factor\". At the report's publication in Queniborough, Tim Healey, chairman of Leicestershire health authority, which prepared the report, paid tribute to the victims' families for their help in the \"painful experience\" of investigating the deaths.

In a one-page statement, the foreign secretary contrasted what he called a \"brutal government ... repressing the people\" - a reference to the Milosevic regime's attacks in the past on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo - to the democratic government of Macedonia. \"Representatives of the Albanian people are members of the government of Macedonia,\" said Mr Cook. About 30% of Macedonia's population is ethnically Albanian. Macedonia's two main Albanian parties yesterday signed a statement urging ethnic Albanian guerrillas to lay down their arms and return home. The situation in the Balkans is certain to feature prominently at the EU summit in Stockholm, beginning on Friday and which will be attended by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. What's going on?

Other rebels are talking of a greater Albania, taking in chunks of Macedonia, the notionally Serb province of Kosovo, and of course Albania itself. The Macedonian government in Skopje - which confusingly includes one of the main Albanian parties - is taking a hardline stance against constitutional reform. It says that it will not negotiate with armed insurgents, and is demanding that Nato forces in Kosovo take action to cut the rebels' supply lines. So far, Nato governments are backing the Skopje authorities - but stopping well short of pledging military aid. Western ministers are now in the embarrassing position of condemning the Albanian guerrillas who were their allies in the 1999 Kosovo war. The Kosovo Liberation Army was supposed to have disbanded in the aftermath of that war, but many of its members are known to be with the rebels in the hills above Tetovo. The US administration, meanwhile, has pledged that its forces in Kosovo will help to patrol the porous border with Macedonia, and that it will also supply Skopje with military intelligence, including detailed aerial photographs. There are also 400 American soldiers in Macedonia, but their role will remain confined to providing logistical help to the US forces in Kosovo. Other Nato governments, including Britain and Norway, have reinforced their contingents in K-For, the polyglot army now running Kosovo.

      "bodyText": "Macedonian tanks joined artillery in blasting ethnic Albanian guerrillas yesterday after the army issued an ultimatum to flee or face an all-out assault. An army statement last night gave the rebels 24 hours to retreat from their mountain positions above the Macedonian town of Tetovo and stop firing. Otherwise, a ground offensive and air strikes would start at midnight tonight. The rebels say they are fighting for more rights for the ethnic Albanian community in Macedonia. But Macedonia says they are separatists seeking to unite with mainly Albanian Kosovo, from where most of their supplies come. Brush fires ignited by shells sent smoke plumes above Macedonia's second city but the self-styled National Liberation Army appeared to hold its ground, six days after it dug in. Troop transports ferried reinforcements into the northern outskirts to prepare for the attack, on which the government has staked its credibility. Morale at police checkpoints seemed high but doubts remained over the reliability of the state's poorly trained conscript army. Around 40% of its soldiers are Albanian, each one considered a potential deserter. Villagers in the arc of territory controlled by the rebels vowed to wage a long war if \"invaded\" by security forces. In the capital, Skopje, however, two moderate Albanian parties agreed to enter the government to try to isolate the insurgents. \"We condemn the use of force for political gains - there is no place for something like that in civilised democratic states,\" read the declaration signed by the Democratic Albanian party and the Democratic Prosperity party. Violence can be \"tragic for us as Macedonian citizens and for the entire region\" , it said. Arben Xhafari, whose Democratic Albanian Party is a member of the Slav-dominated government coalition, denied rumors that his party was leaving the government - but warned it might do so later if violence intensified. He said the government had not fully involved his party in the decision-making process, and said it was \"totally dissatisfied with the amount of [government] force being used\" against the rebels. In the rebel-held village of Germo, a cafe erupted in nervous laughter when TV news reported the deadline. Rebels said it changed nothing. Mule trains with supplies of food and guns were crossing the Sha mountains until nightfall. Government tanks moved into the city on Monday, and the spokesman for the government, Antonio Milosovski, had pledged \"definite action\", saying that field commanders would give the attack order soon. In turn, Nato pledged to \"starve\" the rebels by cutting supply lines from Kosovo. As the government barrage started, an armoured personnel carrier parked at a junction joined in, shooting at farmhouses on the hillside north of Tetovo. Hours earlier, the rebels had published their demands for negotiations. \"We are determined to realise our demands, and urge Macedonian authorities and non-government figures to make public as soon as possible if they want this to be resolved peacefully or not,\" they said in a communique. \"Macedonia's ignorant view and hypocritical disrespect of the demands and the patience of Albanians has surpassed all limits,\" it said. \"We urge the international community to recognize our demands which are for peace, not for war.\" The statement, signed \"National Liberation Army - Tetovo branch,\" ended with a warning that if talks were rejected, \"we will bear no responsibility for the future chain of events.\" Earlier yesterday the Macedonian president, Boris Trajkovski, said there would be \"no negotiations\" with the rebels.

The Afghan authorities place severe restrictions on what women can do - they can't, for example, go anywhere without a male relative aged 15 or more - and the women are nervous of breaking the law. As such, Dr Peart soon realised she would have to go it alone, getting help along the way. This immediately hampered some of her work because only a women would be able to convince Afghan women to get involved in some of the projects she had planned, such as making quilts to protect people from the freezing weather.</p> <p>The logistics of distributing aid can be equally difficult. Assessing exactly how many people are in the various camps is no mean feat, and constant new arrivals and suspicions that families are moving between camps only complicates matters. Calculating how much material and stuffing you need to make 5,000 quilts is tricky, especially when you have no guarantee that enough people will be available to make the quilts or that the local traders won't up the price from one day to the next. Local merchants not coming up with goods also frustrates progress. After 10 days of promises a blanket merchant finally delivered. </p> <p>Getting permission from the Afghan authorities to carry out work can be difficult. They delay visas for no apparent reason and refuse certain agencies permission without saying why. Meanwhile, Security Council sanctions and rumours of US missile strikes heighten tension and make aid workers worry they will be the targets of retaliatory attacks. </p> <p>Simple cultural differences can also hamper work. Ockenden International built latrines in the camps, but Afghan villagers usually go to the toilet in fields and don't know how to use them. As such, latrines get very dirty and unhygenic, or don't get used at all. Dr Peart said faeces surrounded the tents in many camps: a perfect breeding ground for disease, especially when the warm weather comes. The wooden roofed huts they built also raised concerns. The Afghans were grateful for the shelter but, as they cook inside the huts, were worried the roofs would catch fire. Traditionally, they make roofs out of mud. </p> <p>Working and living conditions are, needless to say, difficult. Small heaters provide the only light and warmth and demand for the computer is intense. When money is available there is a rush to type up donor proposals, which often means queues of aid workers typing away until the early hours of the morning, often in the dark.</p> <p>That being said, press reports that the disaster was getting more serious resulted in aid money pouring in, to the extent that there was more than enough money and it was more a case of how to spend it fairly. Seeing that money was available and could be translated into real aid for people in the camps was satisfaction enough for Dr Peart.</p>",

Calculating how much material and stuffing you need to make 5,000 quilts is tricky, especially when you have no guarantee that enough people will be available to make the quilts or that the local traders won't up the price from one day to the next. Local merchants not coming up with goods also frustrates progress. After 10 days of promises a blanket merchant finally delivered. Getting permission from the Afghan authorities to carry out work can be difficult. They delay visas for no apparent reason and refuse certain agencies permission without saying why. Meanwhile, Security Council sanctions and rumours of US missile strikes heighten tension and make aid workers worry they will be the targets of retaliatory attacks. Simple cultural differences can also hamper work. Ockenden International built latrines in the camps, but Afghan villagers usually go to the toilet in fields and don't know how to use them. As such, latrines get very dirty and unhygenic, or don't get used at all. Dr Peart said faeces surrounded the tents in many camps: a perfect breeding ground for disease, especially when the warm weather comes. The wooden roofed huts they built also raised concerns. The Afghans were grateful for the shelter but, as they cook inside the huts, were worried the roofs would catch fire. Traditionally, they make roofs out of mud. Working and living conditions are, needless to say, difficult. Small heaters provide the only light and warmth and demand for the computer is intense. When money is available there is a rush to type up donor proposals, which often means queues of aid workers typing away until the early hours of the morning, often in the dark. That being said, press reports that the disaster was getting more serious resulted in aid money pouring in, to the extent that there was more than enough money and it was more a case of how to spend it fairly. Seeing that money was available and could be translated into real aid for people in the camps was satisfaction enough for Dr Peart.",

      "body": "<p>An outbreak of foot and mouth has been confirmed this morning in the Netherlands, raising inevitable fears of a Europe-wide farming crisis.</p> <p>The Dutch agriculture ministry said that four cows were slaughtered, and that urgent checks are now being carried out on the country's huge national herds of cattle and pigs. France has already confirmed one case, directly connected with sheep imported from Britain.</p> <p>Across western Europe, farmers and officials are on high alert.</p> <p>The disease is spreading throughout Britain at an ever-increasing rate, with 394 confirmed cases as of this morning. The scale of the outbreak is threatening to overwhelm efforts to contain the menace.</p> <p>The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, admitted this morning that serious backlogs are building up in the process of diagnosis, destruction, and disposal of affected animals.</p> <p>Mr Brown and government chief vet Jim Scudamore appeared before the all-party Commons select committee on agriculture, in what was a bruising interrogation. Mr Brown claimed that the disease was not being spread by the movement of animals, because of the restrictions that had been put in place. The decision to impose these measures was, he said, \"absolutely right\".</p> <p>Vets and slaughterers drafted in by the ministry are struggling to keep up with a vast and ever-growing caseload. Small teams of soldiers are now helping with the grisly task of incinerating carcasses in farm fields, but tens of thousands of dead animals are rotting where they lie.</p> <p>The British farm crisis is developing into an ugly political confrontation, with Tory leader William Hague urging the government to delay local council polls due on May 3 - the date most observers believe Tony Blair has earmarked for the general election.</p> <p>In another ominous development for the government, a survey of electors published in this morning's Guardian shows a small majority in favour of postponing the elections.

      "bodyText": "An outbreak of foot and mouth has been confirmed this morning in the Netherlands, raising inevitable fears of a Europe-wide farming crisis. The Dutch agriculture ministry said that four cows were slaughtered, and that urgent checks are now being carried out on the country's huge national herds of cattle and pigs. France has already confirmed one case, directly connected with sheep imported from Britain. Across western Europe, farmers and officials are on high alert. The disease is spreading throughout Britain at an ever-increasing rate, with 394 confirmed cases as of this morning. The scale of the outbreak is threatening to overwhelm efforts to contain the menace. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, admitted this morning that serious backlogs are building up in the process of diagnosis, destruction, and disposal of affected animals. Mr Brown and government chief vet Jim Scudamore appeared before the all-party Commons select committee on agriculture, in what was a bruising interrogation. Mr Brown claimed that the disease was not being spread by the movement of animals, because of the restrictions that had been put in place. The decision to impose these measures was, he said, \"absolutely right\". Vets and slaughterers drafted in by the ministry are struggling to keep up with a vast and ever-growing caseload. Small teams of soldiers are now helping with the grisly task of incinerating carcasses in farm fields, but tens of thousands of dead animals are rotting where they lie. The British farm crisis is developing into an ugly political confrontation, with Tory leader William Hague urging the government to delay local council polls due on May 3 - the date most observers believe Tony Blair has earmarked for the general election. In another ominous development for the government, a survey of electors published in this morning's Guardian shows a small majority in favour of postponing the elections. It also suggests a significant erosion of Labour's lead over the Conservatives, down from 15% to 9% since last month. Ministers have consistently dismissed calls for postponement of the polls, arguing that such a move would smack of panic, and send the worst possible signal to the global food and tourism trade. Ministers are trying to fend off damaging allegations by Tories - and by farmers - that their foot and mouth strategy is crumbling. Nicholas Soames, a Tory MP and a former defence and agriculture minister, has suggested that the Treasury is blocking moves to involve a larger number of soldiers, on cost grounds.

      "bodyText": "The government's claims to be boosting investment in Britain's crumbling public infrastructure were undermined yesterday when official figures showed Labour on course to spend less in every year of this parliament than the Conservatives in their last 12 months in power. Only a last-minute spending spree by Whitehall departments in the final month of the financial year would spare the blushes of the chancellor, Gordon Brown, who had pledged to use part of his burgeoning war chest on improving schools, hospitals and roads this year. Data released jointly by the Treasury and the Office for National Statistics showed that in the first 11 months of the 2000 to 2001 financial year Mr Brown amassed a surplus of \u00a321.2bn, but public investment amounted to\u00a32.9bn of the \u00a37.4bn he had earmarked. This follows three years in which Labour's ferocious control of public spending meant investment in schools, hospitals, roads and the rest of the UK's infrastructure never reached the \u00a34.7bn spent in the final year of John Major's administration. With public spending set to become one of the key battlegrounds in the forthcoming election, Mr Brown expressed frustration yesterday at the failure of departments to spend the money allocated to them. \"We've asked departments to produce investment plans. We now look to them to imple ment these strategies effectively so that the country can benefit from the substantial increase in resources,\" he told members of the Treasury select committee. Edward Davey, the Liberal Democrat member of the committee, said Labour's underspending was not confined to public investment. Mr Davey said the government was spending less on health and education as a proportion of national income than the Conservatives spent under Mr Major. During the 1992 to 1997 Tory administration, spending on health amounted to 5.5% of GDP, but in the four years since Labour's landslide victory it has amounted to 5.4%. Despite the manifesto com mitment to increase the share of the national economic cake spent on education, it has fallen from 5% of GDP to 4.6% between the last parliament and this. Mr Davey said: \"This is conclusive evidence of a bust-boom approach to public investment. It's not surprising people have seen no difference in our schools, hospitals and police under Labour.\" Mr Brown announced ambitious plans in last year's comprehensive spending review for higher public investment over the next few years, rising to \u00a318bn by 2003 to 2004. However, the size of this year's underspend has raised doubts that the money will actually be spent, with some economists blaming the \"pub lic bad, private good\" culture inherited from the previous government for the reluctance by Whitehall officials to sanction spending. Investment has fallen sharply since the introduction of the private finance initiative in the mid-90s. Spending in 1999 to 2000 stood at \u00a33.5bn, lower in inflation-adjusted terms than in all but one of the 18 years in which the Conservatives were in power, and only a quarter of what Labour was spending in the last year of the 1974 to 1979 government, when investment had been scaled back at the behest of the International Monetary Fund.",

The UK's youngest terrestrial channel ended last year \u00a33.7m in the red, compared with a deficit of \u00a36.3m in 1999. Channel 5 also reported revenues of \u00a3148m - a rise of 23% - while its audience share climbed from 5.4% to 5.7%. RTL said the broadcaster, which made headlines last week with Dale Winton's Touch the Truck, had \"flourished in a competitive marketplace\". RTL owns 65% of Channel 5 and is engaged in a game of cat-and-mouse with remaining shareholder United Business Media. The companies clashed in court late last year in a dispute over a \u00a310m film deal for the channel, in a row widely interpreted as a prelude to haggling over the estimated \u00a3280m price of the stake. RTL insiders have made no secret of their desire to take complete control of the channel. But the tension has abated recently, with United chief executive Lord Hollick saying the company would not sell its holding for the next two years. Pearson Television, RTL's production arm, produced more than 200 different shows over the year and sold TV series and films in over 100 different territories. RTL added that Pearson TV's acquisition of Talkback Productions from Griff Rhys-Jones and Mel Smith last summer had \"greatly enhanced\" the company's reputation for \"quality programming\". Pearson TV, which makes hits such as The Bill and Neighbours, reported revenues of \u00a346m - a rise of 12% from 1999.

      "body": "<p>Britain used to be at the forefront of thinking about the welfare state and the delivery of public services. Throughout the 20th century, we were only rivalled by Germany and New Zealand for policy innovation. But the last time Britain led the world was when privatisation of the nationalised industries and competitive tendering in the public sector were at the cutting edge during the 1980s. Now we are left behind as other countries press ahead with more radical reform. It is very instructive to see where we have fallen behind and why. </p> <p>First, we have an unusually centralised welfare state. This problem did not begin on May 1 1997 but it has certainly got a lot worse since then. I recently met a Russian who was teaching at an English school as part of an exchange programme. She had been shocked at the degree of central control over English schools - far more than in her native Moscow. </p> <p>It is a tragedy that the Labour Government abolished grant maintained schools and GP fundholders. These had been valuable sources of new ideas and innovation in delivering public services. But they have been flattened under the bulldozer of centrally imposed uniformity. Dynamic, high quality public services depend on freeing professional people to try out different ways of doing things. </p> <p>That is why one of our first pledges across a wide range of public services is to give greater freedom to individual schools and GP practices. I cannot think of any other large-scale organisation which would operate on the basis that the way to raise standards in 25,000 individual schools, or 8,600 primary care practices is to have even more planning from the centre. It completely cuts across everything we know about how to raise commitment from staff and how to raise quality of service. </p> <p>There is another feature of the British system which makes us an outlier compared with just about every other advanced Western country. They do of course have substantial levels of public finance for education and health - and quite rightly so. But they also have more private spending in addition. </p> <p>This is not a matter of taking away anyone's entitlement to health care or schooling financed by the taxpayer and free at the point of use. But other countries have been far more innovative than us in combining that with extra mechanisms to allow people to spend some of their own money as well. One of the unexplored aspects of Labour is how they remain well to the Left of Continental social democracy on so many welfare state issues. The sort of mixture of public and private provision which are accepted features of healthcare systems in most continental countries would be denounced by Labour here as right-wing extremism. We do not have to copy those countries, but my colleague Liam Fox developed imaginative ideas to show how we can make it easier for people to spend their own money on top of accepting the levels of public spending planned by the Government. </p> <p>So these are the first two Conservative principles when it comes to reform of public services - less central control and new mechanisms to add private spending on top of planned public spending. But it does not stop there. I would add a third principle as well - one of the best ways for Government to help our deprived areas is by competent delivery of core services. This might sound uncontroversial, but one of the worst problems in our deprived areas nowadays is the ceaseless flow of new schemes and initiatives. Again, the problem did not begin on May 1 1997, but it has got far worse since then. Decent people who are trying to help deliver high-quality public services instead spend all their time bidding for penny packets of money for some special scheme. I have identified over 30 special area-based initiatives and zones, often overlapping in their coverage and purpose. </p> <p>The House of Commons Library analysed the number of schemes in individual areas as against the level of deprivation that area suffered. It found little correlation between the number of schemes and the level of deprivation. And even if the schemes work, there is no guarantee of continued funding. In fact the next trick is to dress up a project in some fancy new name so as to disguise the fact that you want to carry on delivering the mainstream service. We want to bring much-needed common sense into this, with a review of the number and complexity of the schemes. </p> <p>I see very similar problems in the social security system. Here again, complexity is the enemy of delivery. The chancellor talks as if all his special schemes such as the Minimum Income Guarantee, or the Working Families Tax Credit, or the Children's Tax Credit, go to people automatically. Indeed, all the treasury's modelling of the distributional impact of Gordon Brown's measures assumes that they reach everyone they are supposed to reach. But they do not. We know that there are a million families that have not applied for the Children's Tax Credit. The Working Families Tax Credit was supposed to reach 1.5m families, but has only got to 1.1m. An expensive \u00a315m take-up campaign for the Minimum Income Guarantee has led to only 82,000 successful claims when the Government estimates there are at least 600,000 pensioners who are eligible for the benefit but not claiming it. There is no point fine-tuning intricate distributional effects if you end up creating a system so complicated that people cannot actually benefit from it. </p> <p>There is a common thread between these different problems. Too much spin and pre-occupation with announcements and re-announcements is getting in the way of good social policy. The best thing is for Governments to get out of the way. Cut the hype. Trust the people. And allow far greater flexibility. </p> <p><strong> David Willetts is MP for Havant and shadow social security secretary </strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "President Bush indicated yesterday the US would take a less active role in Middle East peacemaking, saying he did not want to \"force\" a settlement, but he caused more controversy by restating his campaign promise to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Speaking at the White House with the new Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, sitting beside him, Mr Bush said: \"I told him that our nation will not try to force peace, that we'll facilitate peace and that we will work with those responsible for peace.\" He was echoing the theme adopted by his secretary of state, Colin Powell, who said on Monday that the US \"stands ready to assist, not insist\" on peace measures. Mr Powell has abolished the shuttle envoy job carried out by Dennis Ross in the Clinton years. The new administration is seeking to differentiate itself from its predecessor, whose strenuous efforts to bring about peace between the Palestinians and Israelis collapsed last year. But Mr Bush reopened a long-running controversy over the location of the US embassy, which, like most other embassies, is in Tel Aviv. This stems from a reluctance to put the seal on Israel's claim to Jerusalem as its \"eternal and undivided capital\" when it is also claimed by the Palestinians. The Clinton administration's policy on the embassy was that it was a subject of negotiation between the Israelis and Palestinians, and that moving it unilaterally would cause an Arab uproar. Mr Bush sent a mixed message yesterday. He said: \"Well the status of ... Jerusalem will be ultimately determined by the interested parties.\" But he reminded journalists: \"During the campaign I said we'll begin the process of moving our embassy to Jerusalem.\" In a campaign speech in May last year Mr Bush told the American Israel Political Action Committee: \"As soon as I take office, I will begin the process of moving the US ambassador to the city Israel has chosen as its capital.\" Mr Powell added to the expectation among Israel's supporters that policy is shifting by referring, apparently accidentally, to Jerusalem as Israel's capital when he spoke to the congressional foreign affairs committee. Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, played down the importance of the Bush and Powell remarks, repeating the Clinton-era line that the capital would be \"dealt with in the final-stage negotiations\" for an overall peace settlement. In the coming weeks Mr Bush is due to meet King Abdullah of Jordan and Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president, but no invitation has yet been issued to the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat.

An email circular to friends brings back the odd joke about \"Prince Alberts\", but none of them say they wear much more than the odd hippy bracelet or a ring on one finger. But even if we're not wearing much more of it than we were, our reactions to men and their finery have changed hugely in recent years. A few years ago, David Beckham was humiliated for wearing a sarong, but now the footballer sports his latest taboo-breaking fashion piece - a pair of \u00a320,000 platinum and diamond earrings, said to be by jeweller Theo Fennell - and no one is batting an eyelid. </p> <p>\"Mercifully, the world has become so less homophobic,\" says Fennell, who refuses to confirm whether he designed Beckham's earrings. \"Men are far more comfortable with themselves and far less worried about looking feminine.\" </p> <p>Beckham obviously doesn't care. These luxurious hoops look as if they could have been the overflow from his wife's own jewellery box. They are the sort of style that are copied on the shopping channel QVC, resplendent for a fraction of the cost in its trademark fake stone, Diamonique. They are incredibly feminine, but according to Fennell, what a man's jewellery conveys is no one's business but his own. \"When a man wears jewellery, it sends out far more signals than for a woman,\" he says, \"be it ones of aggression, with ID bracelets and dog tags, or of ineffable wealth. But if it does send out a signal, the man wearing it doesn't mind any more.\" </p> <p>Beckham's ostentatious display of his bank balance is clearly influenced by the ghetto- fabulous world of Puff Daddy and the American gangsta rappers. These men, who thought jewels went hand in hand with guns, often appeared to emulate Liberace in their collection of diamonds and gold. Recently, with a court case rumbling on, Puff Daddy has toned down his act, only wearing the Israeli red thread bracelet called a bendel, supposed to bring the wearer good luck. But the influence has rubbed off on Britain's R&amp;B stars: straight after Craig David found fame with Re-Rewind, he treated himself to a platinum and diamond medallion, with his initials carved into the middle. </p> <p>Beckham is well known for his love of gangsta styles - many of his tattoos echo those that were inked on the body of the late rapper Tupac Shakur. So it follows that he should dispose of some of his income on a few pieces of insanely expensive jewellery. Also in his collection, alongside his diamond wedding ring, is a \u00a340,000 diamond cross, a \u00a345,000 platinum and diamond Cartier watch, and a gold and diamond Cartier bracelet. </p> <p>Perhaps Beckham's extravagance is accepted because many men have a fond allegiance to their adolescent dabbles in jewellery. \"Men of a certain age are wedded to their earrings,\" says Peter Howarth, editor of Esquire. \"When we were 15, at the time of the Buzzcocks and the Clash, the biggest sign of rebellion was to get your ears pierced.\" </p> <p>And so it proves with other generations - Britpop-era men have a proclivity for beads round their neck, as once worn by Damon Albarn from Blur. And survivors of grunge have a taste for piercings, though theirs are usually in harsher places than just the bottom of their ears. </p> <p>But don't think that men are necessarily about to follow Beckham's example and start shoving carats through their ears: this look is strictly for the famous. \"I do think it comes down to who is wearing it,\" says Howarth. \"If you are a footballer or an actor - to all intense and purposes people who do something dramatic - then in a sense it's part of the pantomime. If you work in a building society, you won't wear jewellery because of the peer pressure.\" </p> <p>But Fennell, whose other celebrity clients include Elton John and his partner David Furnish, believes that as long as men have the courage of their convictions, nothing is going too far. \"I quite like it when men wear jewellery,\" he says, \"for the reason that it is over the top. For the same reason I like snakeskin trousers.\" </p> <p>Howarth, though, is less sanguine. Tellingly, the only jewellery he wears are simple, non-gaudy rings. \"Us mere mortals can aspire to that sort of thing,\" he says, \"but jewellery is still considered by some to be extreme.

The public and voluntary sector broadly welcomed the the chancellor's Budget speech but there was underlying disappointment that he had chosen not to channel more of the Treasury's healthy surplus into public services.

Mr Brown announced a new children's tax credit, help for low-paid workers with child care costs and improved maternity and paternity rights and benefits. Low-income families could be up to \u00a32,240 better off, the chancellor said. Child benefit, paid to all 7.5m families with children, will go up in April to \u00a315.50 a week.

The Chinese vice-premier, Qian Qichen, had been due to meet Mr Bush at the White House on Monday. But in a decision designed to show a shift in its Asian priorities, the administration decided to invite the Japanese prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, to Washington first instead. A similar signal was sent last week when the White House announced that Mr Bush's first presidential visit to Asia in October, to attend the Asia-Pacific economic summit in Shanghai, would be preceded by visits to the US's two main traditional allies in the region, Japan and South Korea. When Bill Clinton last visited China, he flew straight to Beijing, and only stopped over in Japan on his way home. The snub to Beijing and the cultivation of Japan partly reflect a shift in personnel in Washington, and a change of ideology. Unlike the Clinton foreign policy establishment, which included many China specialists, Mr Bush's early appointmentsinclude many \"Japan hands\". The need to appease Japanese feelings after the destruction of the Japanese fisheries training vessel Ehime Maru by a US submarine off Hawaii last month played a part in the insistence on giving Mr Mori precedence. On Monday the state department unveiled a further shift in the US approach, confirming that it has dropped the so-called Three Nos policy on Taiwan outlined by Mr Clinton two years ago. \"We adhere to the one China policy,\" spokesman Richard Boucher announced, signalling that the Three Nos - no support for Taiwan independence, no recognition of a separate Taiwanese government, and no backing Taiwan for membership of international organisations - would no longer apply. That change could imply that the Bush administration is moving towards a more combative position towards Taiwan, which could trigger a war of words, and perhaps worse, between Washington, Beijing and Taipei. A key test of that shift will come next month, when Washington is due to give its decision on Taiwan's latest requests for US weapons to defend itself against what it claims is a large military build-up by Beijing. Last month, China announced an 18% increase in defence spending and Beijing is adding 50 new short-range missiles a year to the 300 already trained on Taiwan. Taiwan's list is headed by up to four guided-missile destroyers equipped with the Aegis radar system. Supplying them would be a huge step towards providing the island with a theatre missile defence system. Many conservative congressional Republicans favour that, but it would outrage Beijing. Mr Qian is expected to make it a top issue when he meets Mr Bush. A further test will be the administration's handling of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, promoted by the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, Jesse Helms, a leading anti-Beijing hawk. It allows Washington to give Taiwan more US defence information and upgrade its military assistance. \"There's no question that this administration is much more wary of China and much more supportive of Taiwan,\" a former Pentagon Asia specialist, Derek Mitchell, said yesterday. Chinese officials say that the visit to the US by Mr Qian, who is in charge of China's foreign relations, is intended to avoid a public confrontation, and that Beijing is leaning over backwards not to give ammunition to hardliners in the Bush administration. \"They really are prepared to give the US time,\" a European diplomat in Beijing said. \"They are saying to all sorts of different people: 'Please listen to us ... Let's set the ball rolling on a good foot'.\" One sign of this was the much more muted tone this year of Chinese complaints about the US intention to vote against Beijing at the UN human rights commission in Geneva this month, the diplomat observed. Mr Qian gave an upbeat assessment yesterday to a meeting of US business people, pointing out that the US is China's second biggest trading partner and has become the largest source of direct foreign capital investment in China. His visit follows conciliatory remarks about US-China relations by the Chinese premier, Zhu Rongji last week, when he avoided polemics on contentious issues such as Taiwan and missile defence.",

      "bodyText": "More than 150 youths are to be moved out of a troubled young offenders' institution which was at the centre of allegations that it brutalised its teenage inmates over a 14-year period, the home secretary, Jack Straw, is expected to announce. The move will mean that Portland young offenders' institution in Dorset will no longer hold inmates under the age of 18. It is part of a wider \"root and branch\" shake-up of the way teenage offenders are locked up, to be announced by Mr Straw today. Portland is at the centre of a police investigation into allegations of abuse of inmates exposed last year by the Howard League for Penal Reform. A year ago, the chief inspector of prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham, described conditions as \"a moral outrage\" and said that for too long it had used \"outdated militaristic systems\" and unauthorised bullying routines to keep order. Many of the 150 juvenile offenders at Portland come from as far afield as south Wales and the home counties, and after an abortive search to find places for them in secure units in Wales it has been decided to move some to Ashfield, a new prison near Bristol. Charlotte Day, policy officer at the Howard League, welcomed the decision - taken by the board, which from last April became responsible for \"buying places\" in prisons, local authority secure units and privately run secure training centres, to hold the 3,000 juveniles under 18 whom the courts have ordered should be in custody. The board, chaired by Lord Warner, has also decided to cap the numbers going into Feltham young offenders' institution in west London by di verting some to Hollesley Bay Colony youth offenders' institution in Suffolk. The shake-up comes after a further board decision to stop sending sentenced juveniles to two local authority secure units because of concerns about conditions. The board has just resumed sending children to a third local authority unit, over which concerns were raised last November. None of the three units have been named.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>To prepare for the role of the writer Reinaldo Arenas, the Spanish actor Javier Bardem learned to walk his walk, to speak with his Cuban accent, to kiss a man as if he meant it. And, on a hot Mexican afternoon a week before shooting began, he sat himself down to learn how to type. Tapping out a message with two fingers - \"Help me\" - he began a running letter to Arenas himself, trying to slip into the author's heart. </p> <p>\"When I was reading Reinaldo's work I didn't understand why someone might need to write,\" says Bardem. \"What is he looking for when he writes? Who is he writing to? To himself, to God, to the audience? What's he trying to do? I started writing poems and letters every day, telling him my experience, asking him for help. When I'm writing in the movie, I'm writing to him.\" </p> <p>Bardem's performance in Julian Schnabel's Before Night Falls, based largely on the memoir that the Aids-ravaged Arenas dictated in New York before he committed suicide in 1990 at the age of 47, has won him an Oscar nomination for best actor - the first ever for a Spaniard. </p> <p>Bardem, who turned 32 this month, has made some two dozen films in Spain. He was first noticed in Bigas Luna's 1992 film Jamon, Jamon and gained further attention for his role in Pedro Almodovar's Live Flesh (1997), in which he played a paraplegic policeman. But his role in Before Night Falls - his second English-language film - earned him a nomination for a Golden Globe and the best actor prize at the Venice film festival last September. </p> <p>The excitement mounted with the Oscar nomination. In Spain fans mobbed Bardem on the street; paparazzi waited on his doorstep in Madrid; and King Juan Carlos invited him to dinner. </p> <p>Which brings us on a sleepy Saturday afternoon to his hide-out, a borrowed doctor's office in Barcelona. Bardem has never courted fame in his own country, and he has turned down such commercial propositions as Robert Carlyle's bad-guy role in the James Bond movie The World Is Not Enough. He was troubled by all the excitement. \"It was as if I was playing soccer in the second division, and then someone suddenly put me in the first league.\" </p> <p>He is also in awe of the other best actor nominees. \"They are people I've watched on tape to help me learn to act. When I was doing Arenas dying of Aids, I watched Philadelphia 13 or 14 times, because I thought Tom Hanks was making good choices. And here I am nominated next to him. Russell Crowe, Ed Harris and Geoffrey Rush are magnificent, and for me to be chosen to be one of them is like a dream.\" </p> <p>If that sounds like a rough draft for an acceptance speech, Bardem remains down-to-earth. \"This great imperialistic world called the United States has made us believe that an Oscar is the most important thing in the world for an actor. But if you think about it for five minutes you realise it can't be.\" </p> <p>Bardem's career has been marked by his ability to play a junkie or a cop with equal skill. \"After the success of Jamon, Jamon, Javier was offered lots of very similar roles,\" says Almodovar. \"The very tough, very Spanish kind of guy, but he really never played that same type of role again.\" Almodovar says that while Bardem transforms himself emotionally and physically for each role - he dyed his black hair auburn and lost 12kg for Arenas - \"there's a certain tenderness that is captured by the camera in all his performances, and a kind of masculine nobility that appears in all his characters.\" </p> <p>Schnabel had originally cast Benicio Del Toro as Arenas and Bardem as Lazaro Gomez Carriles, a friend and fellow Cuban refugee who was with the writer during his exile in the US. Arenas was fleeing persecution for his homosexuality and for smuggling his anti-Castro literature out of Cuba. </p> <p>\"I watched his movies, because I wanted to see who this guy was who was going to play me,\" says Carriles, who wrote the script with Schnabel and Cunningham O'Keefe. \"From the moment I saw Javier, he looked like Reinaldo.\" </p> <p>In the end, Del Toro dropped out and Bardem was cast as Arenas. At Schnabel's urging, he read Arenas's work and went to Cuba for three weeks to meet people who had known the writer. \"When I read his books I was feeling his pain - he was an emotional person telling me his truth. I thought that I could do the role, because he was not a thinker, he was a person who entertained through the emotions. And I'm trying to be that kind of actor.\" </p> <p>Bardem says it was hard to convey those emotions in a for eign language (he has since finished shooting John Malkovich's directorial debut, The Dancer Upstairs, also in English). \"In Spain I have my background, my language, but in English I don't have any tricks.\" He overcame his apprehension with hard work. \"Javier has become a specialist in doing roles that are very far from his own personality,\" says Almodovar. \"It seems that he is interested in parts where the preparation takes almost as long as the shooting. He delves into a character very deeply.\" </p> <p>Bardem was too shy to ask Schnabel why he offered him the part, but he never doubted the director's confidence. \"Julian is really in touch with his emotions,\" says Bardem, \"and you sometimes feel overwhelmed by his love. I guess love is trust in a way, and he trusted me 100%. You feel responsible for that.\" </p> <p>Bardem watched documentary footage of Arenas, and Carriles gave him the audio tapes of the writer dictating Before Night Falls. Carriles also helped teach him how to walk like his old friend. \"Reinaldo not only had a little country walk,\" Carriles says, \"but he had this little gay walk too. For almost a year, it felt as if Reinaldo was here, and I could talk to him. Then, after Bardem finished the movie, he became Javier Bardem again, and I felt sad, almost betrayed - as if he had been teasing me.\" </p> <p>To hear Bardem talk, however, you'd think they'd got the wrong man. \"When I first saw the movie, I almost killed myself. I spent six months of my life doing it, so I was expecting to see more. I look at myself, and I see a Spanish person who's trying to be understood by an English-speaking audience and is putting a lot of energy into that, instead of into expressing himself freely and feeling comfortable.\" </p> <p>The rest of the world has a more flattering take. Schnabel says that Bardem won his nomination the hard way. \"He didn't get nominated because he had friends at the academy. \"He earned this nomination because other actors look at this and they see one of those performances that you come across once in a lifetime.\" </p> <p>Malkovich said in a recent interview that Bardem was the best actor in Europe. In Interview magazine, Dennis Hopper called his work \"the best performance of the year and perhaps many years\". </p> <p>Bardem, a wrinkle forming on his brow, says that he found all the attention baffling. \"There are some parts of this movie that I like very much, where I can say to myself, 'Javier, you got it, that's Reinaldo. But there are some other parts where I don't believe what I'm watching.\" </p> <p>Bardem says he would like to get started on a new role but hasn't found anything worth taking on. Besides, he is having a hard time concentrating on anything but making it to Oscar night. </p> <p>Almodovar suggests that Bardem should wait until everything has settled down and refuse all offers for the next three months: \"In spite of being so young, Javier really has a grip on things. He doesn't really want to conquer the American market and become a movie star.\" But Bardem says that he feels lost without an assignment. \"Sometimes I say to myself, what are you doing in this absurd job? Why don't you go to Africa and help people? But I cannot help people, because I am a hypochondriac. I don't know how to drive a car. The only thing I can do is act, but it's not something I even feel comfortable doing. It costs me a lot, because I'm a shy person, even if I don't look it. I want to act because I don't know how to do anything else. But don't call me an actor. I'm just a worker. I am an entertainer. Don't say that what I am doing is art.\" </p> <p>In a final act of deflection, he explains away all this Oscar business by blaming Arenas. \"I don't believe in God,\" he says. \"But I do believe in guardian angels. He chose me for his movie. This is his revenge - for reaching a huge audience, which he couldn't do. That's why I'm getting all this recognition.\"</p> <p>(copyright 2001: New York Times News Service)</p>",

Bardem has never courted fame in his own country, and he has turned down such commercial propositions as Robert Carlyle's bad-guy role in the James Bond movie The World Is Not Enough. He was troubled by all the excitement. \"It was as if I was playing soccer in the second division, and then someone suddenly put me in the first league.\" He is also in awe of the other best actor nominees. \"They are people I've watched on tape to help me learn to act. When I was doing Arenas dying of Aids, I watched Philadelphia 13 or 14 times, because I thought Tom Hanks was making good choices. And here I am nominated next to him. Russell Crowe, Ed Harris and Geoffrey Rush are magnificent, and for me to be chosen to be one of them is like a dream.\" If that sounds like a rough draft for an acceptance speech, Bardem remains down-to-earth. \"This great imperialistic world called the United States has made us believe that an Oscar is the most important thing in the world for an actor. But if you think about it for five minutes you realise it can't be.\" Bardem's career has been marked by his ability to play a junkie or a cop with equal skill. \"After the success of Jamon, Jamon, Javier was offered lots of very similar roles,\" says Almodovar. \"The very tough, very Spanish kind of guy, but he really never played that same type of role again.\" Almodovar says that while Bardem transforms himself emotionally and physically for each role - he dyed his black hair auburn and lost 12kg for Arenas - \"there's a certain tenderness that is captured by the camera in all his performances, and a kind of masculine nobility that appears in all his characters.\" Schnabel had originally cast Benicio Del Toro as Arenas and Bardem as Lazaro Gomez Carriles, a friend and fellow Cuban refugee who was with the writer during his exile in the US. Arenas was fleeing persecution for his homosexuality and for smuggling his anti-Castro literature out of Cuba. \"I watched his movies, because I wanted to see who this guy was who was going to play me,\" says Carriles, who wrote the script with Schnabel and Cunningham O'Keefe. \"From the moment I saw Javier, he looked like Reinaldo.\" In the end, Del Toro dropped out and Bardem was cast as Arenas. At Schnabel's urging, he read Arenas's work and went to Cuba for three weeks to meet people who had known the writer. \"When I read his books I was feeling his pain - he was an emotional person telling me his truth. I thought that I could do the role, because he was not a thinker, he was a person who entertained through the emotions. And I'm trying to be that kind of actor.\" Bardem says it was hard to convey those emotions in a for eign language (he has since finished shooting John Malkovich's directorial debut, The Dancer Upstairs, also in English). \"In Spain I have my background, my language, but in English I don't have any tricks.\" He overcame his apprehension with hard work. \"Javier has become a specialist in doing roles that are very far from his own personality,\" says Almodovar. \"It seems that he is interested in parts where the preparation takes almost as long as the shooting. He delves into a character very deeply.\" Bardem was too shy to ask Schnabel why he offered him the part, but he never doubted the director's confidence. \"Julian is really in touch with his emotions,\" says Bardem, \"and you sometimes feel overwhelmed by his love. I guess love is trust in a way, and he trusted me 100%. You feel responsible for that.\" Bardem watched documentary footage of Arenas, and Carriles gave him the audio tapes of the writer dictating Before Night Falls. Carriles also helped teach him how to walk like his old friend. \"Reinaldo not only had a little country walk,\" Carriles says, \"but he had this little gay walk too. For almost a year, it felt as if Reinaldo was here, and I could talk to him. Then, after Bardem finished the movie, he became Javier Bardem again, and I felt sad, almost betrayed - as if he had been teasing me.\" To hear Bardem talk, however, you'd think they'd got the wrong man. \"When I first saw the movie, I almost killed myself. I spent six months of my life doing it, so I was expecting to see more. I look at myself, and I see a Spanish person who's trying to be understood by an English-speaking audience and is putting a lot of energy into that, instead of into expressing himself freely and feeling comfortable.\" The rest of the world has a more flattering take. Schnabel says that Bardem won his nomination the hard way. \"He didn't get nominated because he had friends at the academy. \"He earned this nomination because other actors look at this and they see one of those performances that you come across once in a lifetime.\" Malkovich said in a recent interview that Bardem was the best actor in Europe. In Interview magazine, Dennis Hopper called his work \"the best performance of the year and perhaps many years\". Bardem, a wrinkle forming on his brow, says that he found all the attention baffling. \"There are some parts of this movie that I like very much, where I can say to myself, 'Javier, you got it, that's Reinaldo. But there are some other parts where I don't believe what I'm watching.\" Bardem says he would like to get started on a new role but hasn't found anything worth taking on. Besides, he is having a hard time concentrating on anything but making it to Oscar night. Almodovar suggests that Bardem should wait until everything has settled down and refuse all offers for the next three months: \"In spite of being so young, Javier really has a grip on things. He doesn't really want to conquer the American market and become a movie star.\" But Bardem says that he feels lost without an assignment. \"Sometimes I say to myself, what are you doing in this absurd job? Why don't you go to Africa and help people? But I cannot help people, because I am a hypochondriac. I don't know how to drive a car. The only thing I can do is act, but it's not something I even feel comfortable doing. It costs me a lot, because I'm a shy person, even if I don't look it. I want to act because I don't know how to do anything else. But don't call me an actor. I'm just a worker. I am an entertainer. Don't say that what I am doing is art.\" In a final act of deflection, he explains away all this Oscar business by blaming Arenas. \"I don't believe in God,\" he says. \"But I do believe in guardian angels. He chose me for his movie. This is his revenge - for reaching a huge audience, which he couldn't do. That's why I'm getting all this recognition.\" (copyright 2001: New York Times News Service)",

In all, the BBC walked away with 14 out of the 26 awards. Channel 4 also enjoyed a successful night, picking up seven awards. But ITV had to settle for four, of which just two were for network shows. Channel 5 and cable and satellite had just one nomination between them, for Disney/BBC children's drama co-production Microsoap - which did not win its category. The champagne corks were popping on BBC Drama tables at London's Grosvenor House for BBC1 series Clocking Off, which picked up best drama series and best writer award for creator Paul Abbott. The single drama prize went to BBC2's Storm Damage; while another BBC2 offering, Nature Boy, carried off the best serial award. Steven Mackintosh was named best actor for his performance in BBC1 drama Care and Katy Murphy scooped best female actor award for her work in Donovan Quick. Other BBC successes included The Royle Family, which beat another Granada TV production, Cold Feet, to the best sitcom and comedy drama award; while Blue Peter won the best children's factual category. Two of the most popular awards of the night were for Rob Brydon, judged best on-screen network newcomer for BBC2's Marion and Geoff; and Julia Davis, who picked up the best TV performance prize for another BBC2 show, Human Remains. But perhaps the biggest cheer of the night greeted the announcement that Graham Norton had won best presenter for Channel 4's So Graham Norton. Channel 4's awards haul also included two gongs for Big Brother, in the primetime features and production team categories. The broadcaster's Da Ali G Show triumphed in the entertainment category. Channel 4 also picked up best single documentary for True Stories strand offering 100% White, and best documentary series for 15. ITV's only RTS awards successes came in the children's categories, with SM:TV judged best entertainment show for the second year running and My Parents Are Aliens picking up best drama. But on a bad night for ITV overall, Scottish Television enjoyed some regional success. STV came away with the best regional programme award for drama New Found Land: I Saw You, and best regional presenter in Stephen Jardine. The Cyril Bennett Judges Award went to LWT and United Productions managing director John Willis. Useful link RTS website: full list of award-winners",

      "body": "<p>Sunderland, within sight of a money-spinning place in the Champions League and enjoying their second biggest average attendance ever, yesterday announced that they were cutting season ticket prices for the 2001-02 campaign. </p> <p>Next season Mackems will, according to the club, enjoy the cheapest season tickets in the top flight with an average reduction of around 10% on this year's prices. The move was taken as the Wearsiders, who currently boast 36,000 season ticket holders, gauge public demand before beginning work on a \u00a39m expansion of the Stadium of Light to a capacity of 55,555 in time for the 2003-04 season. </p> <p>\"We are proud of our pricing policy and the fact that we can reward the fans,\" said the Sunderland chairman Bob Murray. \"It's not the most affluent of places but we will now, on average, have the cheapest season ticket prices in the Premiership.\" </p> <p>The adult price range will run from \u00a3320 to \u00a3435. \"The crowds here are phenomenal. When you look at the population base of 3.5m and the wealth, it's absolutely stunning. Sunderland's progress over the last few years is unmatched by anybody in football, anywhere in the world.\" </p> <p>Sunderland's average attendance is nearly 48,000, and Murray is hoping the move to secure the club's future support will justify building England's second biggest club stadium. </p> <p>\"By the 2003-04 season we will be one of the 20 wealthiest clubs in the world and this is a continued investment in the success of Sunderland,\" he said. \"We have one of the highest wage bills in English football, but our attention remains focused on our season ticket holders and our fan base. Sunderland should be accessible to all, not simply the well off.\" </p> <p>The club, currently fourth in the Premiership, boasts the highest percentage of female season ticket holders in the country at 19% as well as the youngest average season ticket holder. With that in mind, they aim to increase the number of under-12s (season ticket prices reduced by \u00a350 to \u00a395), under-16s (from \u00a3145 to \u00a3133) and young adults (by a maximum of \u00a3125) at the Stadium of Light. </p> <p>\"Research has told us that many season ticket holders reach the precipice between 16 and 17, fall off and don't support the club any more because their parents no longer buy their season tickets since they graduated to adult prices,\" said Sunderland's marketing director Jim Slater. \"We're very much hoping that we will retain those season ticket holders and they will support us for the rest of their lives.\" </p> <p>\"Teenagers are the supporters who tend to suffer most,\" said Shiela Spiers, who sits on the national committee of the Football Supporters' Association. \"If you look at Premier League crowds there are hardly any youngsters compared to a few years ago. Football is in fashion at the moment, but when it goes out of fashion most Premiership clubs will realise that they have not catered for the future.\" </p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson expects to bring Blackburn's transfer-listed goalkeeper Alan Kelly to Manchester United in a loan deal until the end of the season. </p> <p>With the Champions League knockout stages about to start, Ferguson has been looking for experienced cover for Fabien Barthez and Raimond van der Gouw. Kelly fits that bill and talks have taken place between the two clubs. </p> <p>Leeds, quarter-finalists in this year's European Cup, are one of eight Premiership teams to have applied for the one available place in next season's Intertoto Cup third round, to be played on July 14-15. Whichever club finishes highest in the league will win the place, but no one has applied for England's one place in the second round, to be played on June 30. </p> <p> <strong> Intertoto entries: </strong> Aston Villa, Chelsea, Coventry City, Everton, Leeds United, Leicester City, Newcastle United, West Ham United.</p>",

Next season Mackems will, according to the club, enjoy the cheapest season tickets in the top flight with an average reduction of around 10% on this year's prices. The move was taken as the Wearsiders, who currently boast 36,000 season ticket holders, gauge public demand before beginning work on a \u00a39m expansion of the Stadium of Light to a capacity of 55,555 in time for the 2003-04 season. \"We are proud of our pricing policy and the fact that we can reward the fans,\" said the Sunderland chairman Bob Murray. \"It's not the most affluent of places but we will now, on average, have the cheapest season ticket prices in the Premiership.\" The adult price range will run from \u00a3320 to \u00a3435. \"The crowds here are phenomenal. When you look at the population base of 3.5m and the wealth, it's absolutely stunning. Sunderland's progress over the last few years is unmatched by anybody in football, anywhere in the world.\" Sunderland's average attendance is nearly 48,000, and Murray is hoping the move to secure the club's future support will justify building England's second biggest club stadium. \"By the 2003-04 season we will be one of the 20 wealthiest clubs in the world and this is a continued investment in the success of Sunderland,\" he said. \"We have one of the highest wage bills in English football, but our attention remains focused on our season ticket holders and our fan base. Sunderland should be accessible to all, not simply the well off.\" The club, currently fourth in the Premiership, boasts the highest percentage of female season ticket holders in the country at 19% as well as the youngest average season ticket holder. With that in mind, they aim to increase the number of under-12s (season ticket prices reduced by \u00a350 to \u00a395), under-16s (from \u00a3145 to \u00a3133) and young adults (by a maximum of \u00a3125) at the Stadium of Light. \"Research has told us that many season ticket holders reach the precipice between 16 and 17, fall off and don't support the club any more because their parents no longer buy their season tickets since they graduated to adult prices,\" said Sunderland's marketing director Jim Slater. \"We're very much hoping that we will retain those season ticket holders and they will support us for the rest of their lives.\" \"Teenagers are the supporters who tend to suffer most,\" said Shiela Spiers, who sits on the national committee of the Football Supporters' Association. \"If you look at Premier League crowds there are hardly any youngsters compared to a few years ago. Football is in fashion at the moment, but when it goes out of fashion most Premiership clubs will realise that they have not catered for the future.\" Sir Alex Ferguson expects to bring Blackburn's transfer-listed goalkeeper Alan Kelly to Manchester United in a loan deal until the end of the season. With the Champions League knockout stages about to start, Ferguson has been looking for experienced cover for Fabien Barthez and Raimond van der Gouw. Kelly fits that bill and talks have taken place between the two clubs. Leeds, quarter-finalists in this year's European Cup, are one of eight Premiership teams to have applied for the one available place in next season's Intertoto Cup third round, to be played on July 14-15. Whichever club finishes highest in the league will win the place, but no one has applied for England's one place in the second round, to be played on June 30. Intertoto entries: Aston Villa, Chelsea, Coventry City, Everton, Leeds United, Leicester City, Newcastle United, West Ham United.",

In a trademark beach shot by Mr Fraser, a shaven-headed Ms Thompson is snapped in an intimate moment with her boyfriend and 16-month daughter Gaia Romilly on holiday in Cyprus. In an unprecedented appointment, Mr Fraser has joined the company to co-ordinate photographic coverage across the newspapers and magazines owned by Express Newspapers and Northern &amp; Shell.

During the 1992 to 1997 Tory administration, spending on health amounted to 5.5% of GDP, but in the four years since Labour's landslide victory it has amounted to 5.4%. Despite the manifesto com mitment to increase the share of the national economic cake spent on education, it has fallen from 5% of GDP to 4.6% between the last parliament and this. Mr Davey said: \"This is conclusive evidence of a bust-boom approach to public investment. It's not surprising people have seen no difference in our schools, hospitals and police under Labour.\" Mr Brown announced ambitious plans in last year's comprehensive spending review for higher public investment over the next few years, rising to \u00a318bn by 2003 to 2004. However, the size of this year's underspend has raised doubts that the money will actually be spent, with some economists blaming the \"pub lic bad, private good\" culture inherited from the previous government for the reluctance by Whitehall officials to sanction spending. Investment has fallen sharply since the introduction of the private finance initiative in the mid-90s. Spending in 1999 to 2000 stood at \u00a33.5bn, lower in inflation-adjusted terms than in all but one of the 18 years in which the Conservatives were in power, and only a quarter of what Labour was spending in the last year of the 1974 to 1979 government, when investment had been scaled back at the behest of the International Monetary Fund.",

The pan-European broadcaster said restructuring its Pearson TV production outfit in the US and a declining audience for its RTL Radio station in France would affect the group over the next 12 months. It added that setting up operations in Poland, India and Indonesia had also eaten into earnings. \"Combined with the effects of restructuring Pearson Television North America and a decrease in the audience of RTL Radio in France, market conditions at present lead us to expect a comparatively flat earnings performance in 2001,\" said Didier Belens, chief executive of RTL. Mr Belens painted an even gloomier picture when he added that television advertising income had declined since the beginning of the year. He said the core German market had suffered a 2.8% drop in advertising revenue between January and February this year. However, Mr Belens added the group was \"better placed than most of our competitors\" to withstand the slump in the advertising market. RTL's preliminary results for 2000 registered a fall of over 50% in pre-tax profits - from \u00a3366m in 1999 to \u00a3184m. The 1999 results were presented on a \"proforma\" basis, as RTL was formed last year by the merger of Pearson TV in the UK and Luxembourg-based CLT-Ufa, owned by German media giant Bertelsmann. Television brought in \u00a31.76bn of RTL's \u00a32.55bn earnings last year, with reduced costs at its Channel 5, Vox and RTL Klub channels helping to boost the figures. New media ventures were an inevitable drain on the company's performance, with the group's internet arm reporting a loss of \u00a321.5m. RTL is hoping to break into the flagship FTSE 100 index later this year when it releases more shares onto the market, and the chance to invest in a group that is 67% owned by Bertelsmann. Some analysts believe Financial Times owner Pearson would reduce uncertainty over its own shares if it sold its 22% stake in RTL, although it is unlikely to get a good price for its holding in current market conditions.

      "bodyText": "A six million dollar campaign to boost patriotic pride in Russia was launched by the Kremlin this week, aimed at rallying the country's media, its film industry and the military to work together to inspire the entire nation with a reawakened love of the motherland. Video games based on glorious episodes from Russian history are to be commissioned to instil a respect for Russia's past in its youth; the Soviet tradition of naming schools after contemporary and historical national heroes is to be revived; and patriotic websites will be established on the Internet at the government's expense to bolster the population's self-belief. Russia's media will be invited to produce \"programmes, shows, films and books that further patriotic education\" and encouraged to favour \"positive heroes\"; they will also be asked to \"energetically oppose the distortion of the Fatherland's history\". Prizes will be offered to those film makers and journalists who work hardest to build a triumphant image of modern Russia. With thousands of young men seeking to evade military service every year, the programme is also designed to foster respect and enthusiasm for the army - by the creation of a network of \"patriotic-military\" sports and social clubs throughout the country. The concept of patriotic education, which was used to powerful effect throughout the Soviet era, has largely disappeared over the decade of transition and President Vladimir Putin's government believes it is vital to restore it in order to nurture Russia's wounded self-esteem. In the wake of recent blows to Russian pride - the Kursk nuclear submarine tragedy, the humiliation of catastrophic economic crises and the ongoing debilitating war in Chechnya - the government has very ambitious hopes for the new campaign, optimistic that it will not only improve national morale, but will also \"aid the preservation of social stability, help the resurrection of the nation's economy and strengthen the country's defensive capacity\". The project is backed by Mr Putin who has repeatedly referred to the need to foster a new sense of pride amongst the population for their homeland. The full text of the curiously anachronistic five-year plan for \"patriotic education of citizens of the Russian Federation\" explains that the \"gradual loss of traditional Russian patriotism has become more and more noticeable\". It claims that the \"economic disintegration, social breakup of the community and the erosion of spiritual values\" in recent years have led to \"indifference, individualism, cynicism, unmotivated aggression and disrespectful attitudes towards the state\". Designed to cater for every group in Russian society, the programme declares that its main aim is to \"create in citizens a high patriotic consciousness, a sense of loyalty to the fatherland, and a readiness to perform civil duties and constitutional obligations in order to defend the interests of the homeland\". A source from the Ministry of Education said fostering patriotism should not be confused with encouraging nationalism, and argued that the initiative was simply an attempt to help Russia's population rediscover an affection for its country after a period of disorientating political upheaval. \"Sociological research has shown that since the collapse of the Soviet Union, when a great many shocking facts were published about the USSR's history, there has been a wholesale rejection of the country's past by its population - including those aspects of it in which one could take pride,\" the source said. \"Our programme isn't aimed at imposing some kind of new ideology on the population; we are highlighting the importance of education in love and respect for one's country.\" No extra money from this year's budget has been set aside for the project, although the government intends to spend about $6m (\u00a34.2m) over the course of the five-year programme. The education, defence and culture ministries are this year obliged to find the resources to launch the initiative out of their own already tight budgets. It was not clear whether the money available would be enough to finance the high expectations of the project's creators. State Duma deputy Sergei Yushchenkov, a member of the liberal Union of Right Forces party, said whatever sum of money was allocated to the project would be too much. \"This is a completely unnecessary and potentially dangerous programme.

Some have donated free exercise books to British schools. Interleaved with the blank pages are such salutary exhortations as \"Stand up for your beliefs and values; take responsibility for your own actions; [get] spot protection by simply washing daily [with] Clearasil\". Others have handed out teaching materials. A pack about \"puberty and menstrual health\", kindly provided by Tampax, warns girls that sanitary pads are uncomfortable, unhygienic and environmentally damaging; Tampax tampons, by contrast, are good for you and good for the planet. </p> <p>A school newspaper partly sponsored by Nestl\u00e9 pub-lished a page of children's poems and stories about Nestl\u00e9 products, such as \"Nestl\u00e9 chocolate is the best/ Eat it for a hairy chest...\" A teaching pack from Coca-Cola instructs pupils that non- refillable bottles are more environmentally-friendly than returnable ones. </p> <p>But the sponsorship of teaching materials is the least of the market opportunities education now provides. The government's education action zones are clusters of schools run by committees on which businesses must be represented.

      "bodyText": "All too often the education process is entrusted to people who appear to have no understanding of industry and the path of progress,\" the European Roundtable of Industrialists complained in 1998. \"The provision of education is a market opportunity and should be treated as such.\" Companies have not been slow to respond. Some have donated free exercise books to British schools. Interleaved with the blank pages are such salutary exhortations as \"Stand up for your beliefs and values; take responsibility for your own actions; [get] spot protection by simply washing daily [with] Clearasil\". Others have handed out teaching materials. A pack about \"puberty and menstrual health\", kindly provided by Tampax, warns girls that sanitary pads are uncomfortable, unhygienic and environmentally damaging; Tampax tampons, by contrast, are good for you and good for the planet. A school newspaper partly sponsored by Nestl\u00e9 pub-lished a page of children's poems and stories about Nestl\u00e9 products, such as \"Nestl\u00e9 chocolate is the best/ Eat it for a hairy chest...\" A teaching pack from Coca-Cola instructs pupils that non- refillable bottles are more environmentally-friendly than returnable ones. But the sponsorship of teaching materials is the least of the market opportunities education now provides. The government's education action zones are clusters of schools run by committees on which businesses must be represented. Last year the government launched a network of \"city academies\": urban secondary schools partly run by the private sector. Next month schools in Leeds will be outsourced to a \"joint venture company\". The market, the champions of privatisation argue, is keener and leaner than the public sector.

      "bodyText": "Advertisers are demanding new rules on poster advertising after yet another company had its posters banned by the London Underground. Heart 106.2 has become the latest advertiser to have its posters blocked by London Underground bosses. The advert shows a couple snogging over the words, \"Just another night in?\", followed by Heart's tagline, \"The right song, right now\". The decision follows London Underground's controversial refusal to carry a poster for the fashion retailer Miss Selfridge that showed women posing in bikinis. \"Rulings by London Underground over what is acceptable and what is not are leaving advertisers more and more confused,\" said Gill Woods, marketing manager of Heart 106.2. \"The objective of any Heart 106.2 campaign is to raise awareness in the public domain and any which we have embarked on has always been based on research and our knowledge of our target market. \"Ultimately any creative we use is going be representative of the brand and appeal to our audience, not offend them,\" she added. Only last week, the ASA cleared a campaign for Spitfire beer that had previously been banned by the London Underground. The beer's manufacturer was ordered to pull down its tongue-in-cheek posters after London Underground bosses decided they could be offensive to German tourists. But the ASA cleared Spitfire of any wrongdoing. London Underground was last night insisting it did not have to abide by the ASA's rulings. \"The company that sells our advertising space does turn down a lot of posters that they know we'll get complaints about, even if they have been cleared by the ASA,\" said a spokeswoman for London Underground. \"Three million paying customers use the underground every day and we don't want to offend them,\" she added. The ASA said it had received seven complaints about the Heart 106.2 posters, which have run outside London Underground, and was in talks with the advertiser.

A survey carried out by the Centre for Evidence Based Social Services (Cebss) confirmed academics' fears: while professionals on the ground are keen to use research to improve their services, there are few opportunities to do so. </p> <p>Last month, the government committed itself to raising the profile of research, promising establishment in the summer of a social care institute for excellence (Scie). Next week, in London, social care professionals will meet to discuss ways of harnessing evidence to improve life for social services clients. </p> <p>The joint Guardian and National Institute for Social Work (NISW) conference, Using Knowledge to Promote Quality, will look at the future for evidence-based practice. Taken together with two other emerging bodies, the general social care council and the national care standards commission, ministers hope Scie will improve care in England and Wales, overcoming variations in standards of service provided across the country. This will be partly through the creation of a database of what works in social care, reviews of research and best practice guidance. </p> <p>Scie - pronounced \"sky\" - may be the first central body dedicated to promoting evidence-based practice in social care, but a handful of organisations has for some time been beavering away on a similar agenda. </p> <p>The south-west of England is a veritable hive of activity. Brian Sheldon, director of Cebss, and his team at the University of Exeter have held no fewer than 163 conferences on evidence-based practice. The Research in Practice initiative, based at the Dartington Social Research Unit, in Devon, but working with Sheffield University, concentrates on improving services for children and families. Also under the umbrella, a consortium of universities known as Making Research Count is working to disseminate research on children and community care. Meanwhile, NISW has formed the electronic library for social care to give professionals easy access to data already available. </p> <p>Creation of Scie has been welcomed by professionals who see it as complementing work already underway. Celia Atherton, Dartington's director, wants Scie to establish a scientific method for reviewing social services research, akin to that used by the health service. \"There's no need to reinvent the car, but we do need a vehicle suitable for our terrain,\" she says. </p> <p>Scie will also need to commission research reviews and work with organisations like Dartington to ensure that research-based guidance works in practice, says Atherton. Research in Practice, like Cebss, is a partnership venture and its work is shaped by the agencies it works with. \"It means we can talk to busy frontline teams about how they can best use research,\" Atherton says. </p> <p>She also believes that Scie should work to bridge the gap between what research is carried out in the universities and what is needed on the ground - while, at the same time, involving service users in decisions about research priorities. This gap is a source of much resentment in the social care world. Sheldon pulls no punches: \"From the social work perspective,\" he says, \"a great deal of research has been commissioned for the career prospects of academics, not for the benefit of social care clients.\" </p> <p>Academics and practitioners inhabit very different worlds, says Atherton. \"Research generally talks about patterns, but social welfare staff deal with individuals. Organisations like ours help translate the research into information that can be used on the ground.\" </p> <p>A common complaint from practitioners is that the Department of Health commissions research that takes four years to complete, is subjected to peer review and is out of date by the time it is published. \"So much has a negligible impact on practice,\" says David Johnstone, Devon's social services director. He argues that the gap between commissioning and publication is too long, insufficient emphasis is placed on dissemination and the quality of work is highly variable. </p> <p>Sheldon agrees. \"The wheat to chaff ratio is worringly low,\" he says. Some studies involve \"little more than grabbing the nearest 60 people and interviewing them with tape recorders\". </p> <p>Daphne Statham, NISW director, accepts that there are gaps in research. Social care is a poor relation to health in many ways and research is no exception, she says, with health spending dwarfing what is spent on social care studies. However, she argues that evidence-based practice is about more than conventional research: it should include information from service users about what works for them, as well as managers' views on what constitute successful outcomes. </p> <p>Atherton wants to see more short-term research, which will produce results quicker, and far more longitudinal studies which track people over time. \"If someone's looked after until they're 18, we don't know the impact of that care until they are in their 20s or are parents themselves,\" she says. </p> <p>Academics are not solely to blame for the fact that so much research fails to trickle down to the area social services office. Universities' research is funded according to how well previous studies have been rated following peer review. A department's success in disseminating and changing practice in the secular world, say critics, has little currency when it comes to securing funds for future work. </p> <p>When Cebss was established in 1997, it surveyed 2,500 staff in the south-west to discover how research was used in practice. The team uncovered numerous obstacles to effective dissemination. </p> <p>\"There is a wealth of material out there, but electronic access to data bases has been limited,\" Sheldon explains. Also, a culture of action, as opposed to contemplation, means staff are rarely given the time to consider the principles behind their decision-making. But most important of all, he says, is that inadequate social work training means social workers simply do not know how to access or interpret research. \"Only a tiny proportion of our sample could identify or describe evidence for what they did,\" he says. </p> <p>Scie is seen as following in the footsteps of Nice, its sister body in the NHS. The new institute may have an equally friendly-sounding acronym, but experts predict that some of its missives will be just as hard to digest. If Scie does its job properly, it will be telling the social care world what does not work as much as what does, says Statham. </p> <p>If this is the case, will Scie's instructions meet with the same resistance that has greeted some of Nice's less palatable pronouncements? Statham is hopeful: \"People find change difficult, but they will move if they think the evidence makes sense in their day-to-day work,\" she says. Although evidence-based practice does not provide staff with all the answers, \"it will help them make more intelligent judgments and explain the decisions they've made to service users and up the line of command to the managers\". </p> <p>Using Knowledge to Promote Quality, sponsored by Sheridan Systems, takes place next Tuesday.

      "byline": "Stefano Hatfield",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There's no real surprise about Interpublic buying True North, other than perhaps the price. It had always seemed a more likely suitor than Havas, its chief rival. What's more, in the current warped fin de siecle value system, $2.1bn for a upper middle-ranked global network group doesn't seem too bad a price for Interpublic's new CEO John Dooner to pay.</p> <p>US analysts suggested just that in a remarkably tame conference call on Monday morning held to explain the move. The all-stock deal to acquire brands like FCB, Marketing Drive, BSMG and Bozell seems better value for the buyer than similar amounts paid by Havas for a highly-priced Snyder Communications, and WPP for a badly-holed Young &amp; Rubicam. It certainly appears better relative value than the $265m Dooner paid for Deutsch in December.</p> <p>Some senior industry figures contend that the analysts do not fully understand the sector. Most notably, there continues to be an obsession with the higher profile advertising agency components of the groups. Advertising now accounts for only 44% of Omnicom's revenues for example. And, it is the non-advertising services that traditionally do better during the kind of downturn in which the US advertising industry is currently mired.</p> <p>So, it's interesting to note that although the deal propels Interpublic ahead of Omnicom and WPP to the number one slot, it actually increases the group's share of revenues from traditional advertising, and puts yet more of its focus on the ailing US market. What's more, it still doesn't resolve the thorny issue of the group's media buying operations.</p> <p>Crucially, Interpublic can point to an expected $25m of cost savings. And, it is the apparent relative ease with which it will be able to digest True North which held sway over an ostensibly higher offer from Havas. The True North CEO, David Bell, and FCB's Brendan Ryan are certainly on board and making positive nosies, which is good. It also helps that Interpublic looks more likely to be in a position to buy back shares if need be than Havas.</p> <p>If all of this appears far removed from the craft of creating marketing messages, then it both is, and is not. Ever more global clients are demanding ever more geographical and multi-disciplinary resources of their suppliers. Funding extensive media research or loss-making offices in China are both expensive. The horrible \"synergies\" that come with being part of a larger group really do help here.</p> <p>True North has needed to do something to compete in the global premier league, ever since its partnership with the French group Publicis (still a shareholder, and one that would not be happy to sell to Havas) fell apart. Last November's loss of the giant Chrysler business to Omnicom's BBDO only accelerated the inevitable.</p> <p>There really is a big three now, and the rest of the industry will be playing catch-up. As the giant groups consolidate, it gets ever harder to separate out being bigger from being better, certainly in media buying, research and internet services. That is, unless you are a client that is simply looking for some talent to create great advertising. The truth is, advertising today is much more about Wall Street than Soho. And this deal will keep Wall Street happy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There's no real surprise about Interpublic buying True North, other than perhaps the price. It had always seemed a more likely suitor than Havas, its chief rival. What's more, in the current warped fin de siecle value system, $2.1bn for a upper middle-ranked global network group doesn't seem too bad a price for Interpublic's new CEO John Dooner to pay. US analysts suggested just that in a remarkably tame conference call on Monday morning held to explain the move. The all-stock deal to acquire brands like FCB, Marketing Drive, BSMG and Bozell seems better value for the buyer than similar amounts paid by Havas for a highly-priced Snyder Communications, and WPP for a badly-holed Young &amp; Rubicam. It certainly appears better relative value than the $265m Dooner paid for Deutsch in December. Some senior industry figures contend that the analysts do not fully understand the sector. Most notably, there continues to be an obsession with the higher profile advertising agency components of the groups. Advertising now accounts for only 44% of Omnicom's revenues for example. And, it is the non-advertising services that traditionally do better during the kind of downturn in which the US advertising industry is currently mired. So, it's interesting to note that although the deal propels Interpublic ahead of Omnicom and WPP to the number one slot, it actually increases the group's share of revenues from traditional advertising, and puts yet more of its focus on the ailing US market. What's more, it still doesn't resolve the thorny issue of the group's media buying operations. Crucially, Interpublic can point to an expected $25m of cost savings. And, it is the apparent relative ease with which it will be able to digest True North which held sway over an ostensibly higher offer from Havas. The True North CEO, David Bell, and FCB's Brendan Ryan are certainly on board and making positive nosies, which is good. It also helps that Interpublic looks more likely to be in a position to buy back shares if need be than Havas. If all of this appears far removed from the craft of creating marketing messages, then it both is, and is not. Ever more global clients are demanding ever more geographical and multi-disciplinary resources of their suppliers. Funding extensive media research or loss-making offices in China are both expensive. The horrible \"synergies\" that come with being part of a larger group really do help here. True North has needed to do something to compete in the global premier league, ever since its partnership with the French group Publicis (still a shareholder, and one that would not be happy to sell to Havas) fell apart. Last November's loss of the giant Chrysler business to Omnicom's BBDO only accelerated the inevitable. There really is a big three now, and the rest of the industry will be playing catch-up. As the giant groups consolidate, it gets ever harder to separate out being bigger from being better, certainly in media buying, research and internet services. That is, unless you are a client that is simply looking for some talent to create great advertising. The truth is, advertising today is much more about Wall Street than Soho. And this deal will keep Wall Street happy.",

Paul Dockery, prosecuting, told the jury that all three defendants thought the route over the railway line was an approved route.</p> <p>He said that by trespassing they had risked the safety of themselves and the people on the train.</p> <p>\"By their presence on the railway track they not only endangered the safety of those on the train, but also themselves ... particularly when they had not even looked at the train timetable.\"</p> <p>The group was on a trip to study the estuary of the River Winster when they walked up a flight of steps and along the railway track to reach a second set of steps leading down to the estuary on the other side.</p> <p>Mr Dockery told the court that on the return journey from the estuary the group heard a train approaching.</p> <p>He said Rankin, of Stockport, Greater Manchester, told the children to line up or sit on the sea wall next to the track because she did not know how far away the steps on the other side were.</p> <p>Mr Dockery continued: \"The driver saw a group of school children walking in the same direction that the train was going.

      "bodyText": "A teacher and school governor risked the lives of pupils, railway staff and passengers by leading a group of children on a field trip over a railway line and into the path of an oncoming train, a court heard yesterday. The driver of the passenger train sounded his horn and had to pull on the emergency brakes after he spotted a group of children and two adults on the track just 150 yards ahead, Preston crown court was told. The pupils, accompanied by teacher Melanie Rankin and parent governor Philip Ramsden, were from Fairway primary school in Stockport, Greater Manchester. No one was injured during the incident. The 13 children - all aged 11 at the time - were led across the railway track near Grange over Sands, Cumbria, in June 1999, the court heard Rankin, 26, and Ramsden, 41, deny endangering the safety of the pupils in their care and people on the train by trespassing on the line. They also deny obstructing the train. Headteacher Lynn Boyle, 42, denies two charges of aiding and abetting the endangerment and obstruction by ap proving the route of the field trip. Paul Dockery, prosecuting, told the jury that all three defendants thought the route over the railway line was an approved route. He said that by trespassing they had risked the safety of themselves and the people on the train. \"By their presence on the railway track they not only endangered the safety of those on the train, but also themselves ... particularly when they had not even looked at the train timetable.\" The group was on a trip to study the estuary of the River Winster when they walked up a flight of steps and along the railway track to reach a second set of steps leading down to the estuary on the other side. Mr Dockery told the court that on the return journey from the estuary the group heard a train approaching. He said Rankin, of Stockport, Greater Manchester, told the children to line up or sit on the sea wall next to the track because she did not know how far away the steps on the other side were. Mr Dockery continued: \"The driver saw a group of school children walking in the same direction that the train was going. To the driver's eye he saw the gang as walking between the rails but as far as the prosecution are concerned whether some of the gang were between the rails or on the side of the rails matters not\". The driver, he said, \"saw them ahead of him, he estimated 150 yards. What he did was apply the emergency brakes and sound his horn and attempt to bring the train to a halt but he did not bring the train to a halt, it stopped beyond the group.\" The case continues. \u0095 A nine-year-old girl on a school sailing trip drowned beneath a capsized boat after her teacher failed to realise she was missing, according to an official accident report yesterday. Elizabeth Bee was one of nine pupils from Boundary Oak independent school in Fareham, Hampshire, thrown from their craft with their teacher, Paul Dove, into Portsmouth harbour amid strong winds in September 1999. Mr Dove, 64, failed to count his pupils after the incident and it was at least nine minutes later that Elizabeth's twin sister, Victoria, noticed her absence, the report by the marine accident investigation branch found. Investigators criticised the school for failing to carry out professional safety checks on the \"grossly overloaded\" 14ft dory. The crown prosecution service decided last year not to act against Boundary Oak or Mr Dove, but Elizabeth's mother, Lesley Bee, yesterday said she planned to take legal action against the school. The school said all sailing activities had been suspended after the accident and permanently discontinued last year.",

      "body": "<p>They're all at it. No matter where you look, you'll find a politician from some point on the spectrum banging on about the need to do something to provide \"affordable housing\" for \"key workers\" in \"property hotspots\". There's no shortage of elected representatives happy to talk the talk on the staffing crisis in the public services but how many are seriously prepared to walk the walk?</p> <p>First off, let's have a look at the coded language.</p> <p>Just what is it that constitutes \"affordable housing\"? When I was a councillor back in the mid-eighties, we still had a housing committee and we still talked about council housing. However, the Thatcher government stopped us from building any new units, forced us to flog off the best stock, locked all our capital receipts away in the vaults of the local Nat West bank and banned us from touching it.</p> <p>We were reduced to a few nomination rights for housing association stock and had little choice but to introduce punitive points systems for the dwindling pool of accommodation at our disposal. Way back then, we housed thousands of public sector staff in council properties at reasonable cost. You won't find many people talking about council houses now, just a few of us old Labour dinosaurs. Now it's called social or affordable housing and getting access to it is a damn site harder than breaking out of the Big Brother compound.</p> <p>Parallel to the assault on council housing stock came the search and destroy policy on directly-provided NHS accommodation. While yuppie estate agents queued round the block to plunder the health service's housing assets, the trade unions warned there would be a long-term price to pay. Perhaps one or two of those estate agents have felt a pang of guilt when the heart attack has kicked in and there are no specialist nurses at the local coronary care unit. Call me a vindictive bastard, but I'd like to think so.</p> <p>And what defines a \"key worker\"? We know some politicians mean the police, nurses, possibly teachers and, on a good day, maybe even social workers. However, few, if any, would include heath care assistants, support workers, cleaners and the rest of the hidden staff who play a crucial role in the social care team and who really make the services tick.</p> <p>This divisive approach is nothing new but the long-term implications are horrendous. Various odds and sods of bonuses and special housing deals have been handed out to small groups of staff in the public eye to give the impression that they're tackling the issue. Meanwhile, thousands of the other key staff who count just as much are buggering off to work at Tesco's, where they'll get better pay and flexible working conditions and more respect. I don't blame them at all.</p> <p>And finally, \"housing hot spots\". As a London trade unionist, I can understand why some of my colleagues from other areas in the UK give me a jaundiced look when I tell them how tough things are in the capital. But it's a fact that nowhere is the gap between the haves and have-nots wider than in areas such as the East End. But there are plenty of other inner cities - Manchester, Leeds and Bristol to name just three - where they are catching up fast.</p> <p>Politicians will pay lip service to these issues all the time they can get away with it. Our job is to confront the public with some hard truths, and the hardest truth of all is that if government doesn't start making some concrete moves to value and respect all members of the public services team then those services just won't be there when you turn up to use them. So how do we get that up the political agenda in time for the general election? I'm open to suggestions.</p>",

First off, let's have a look at the coded language. Just what is it that constitutes \"affordable housing\"? When I was a councillor back in the mid-eighties, we still had a housing committee and we still talked about council housing. However, the Thatcher government stopped us from building any new units, forced us to flog off the best stock, locked all our capital receipts away in the vaults of the local Nat West bank and banned us from touching it. We were reduced to a few nomination rights for housing association stock and had little choice but to introduce punitive points systems for the dwindling pool of accommodation at our disposal. Way back then, we housed thousands of public sector staff in council properties at reasonable cost. You won't find many people talking about council houses now, just a few of us old Labour dinosaurs. Now it's called social or affordable housing and getting access to it is a damn site harder than breaking out of the Big Brother compound. Parallel to the assault on council housing stock came the search and destroy policy on directly-provided NHS accommodation. While yuppie estate agents queued round the block to plunder the health service's housing assets, the trade unions warned there would be a long-term price to pay. Perhaps one or two of those estate agents have felt a pang of guilt when the heart attack has kicked in and there are no specialist nurses at the local coronary care unit. Call me a vindictive bastard, but I'd like to think so. And what defines a \"key worker\"? We know some politicians mean the police, nurses, possibly teachers and, on a good day, maybe even social workers. However, few, if any, would include heath care assistants, support workers, cleaners and the rest of the hidden staff who play a crucial role in the social care team and who really make the services tick. This divisive approach is nothing new but the long-term implications are horrendous. Various odds and sods of bonuses and special housing deals have been handed out to small groups of staff in the public eye to give the impression that they're tackling the issue. Meanwhile, thousands of the other key staff who count just as much are buggering off to work at Tesco's, where they'll get better pay and flexible working conditions and more respect. I don't blame them at all. And finally, \"housing hot spots\". As a London trade unionist, I can understand why some of my colleagues from other areas in the UK give me a jaundiced look when I tell them how tough things are in the capital. But it's a fact that nowhere is the gap between the haves and have-nots wider than in areas such as the East End. But there are plenty of other inner cities - Manchester, Leeds and Bristol to name just three - where they are catching up fast. Politicians will pay lip service to these issues all the time they can get away with it. Our job is to confront the public with some hard truths, and the hardest truth of all is that if government doesn't start making some concrete moves to value and respect all members of the public services team then those services just won't be there when you turn up to use them. So how do we get that up the political agenda in time for the general election? I'm open to suggestions.",

My mind wandered as his voice droned onwards, intelligent, articulate, yet curiously dull and bucolic, like an Oxford don with a straw in his mouth. I reflected idly that the people of the 14th century should have been pleased that Mr Meacher wasn't in charge of combatting the Black Death. \"I am happy to inform the house that the tumbril tax will be temporarily halved from one groat, or alternatively an impost of all corn milled between Lammas and Michaelmas, enabling speedy disposal of human carcasses in the present distressing circumstances. \"A special town criers' hotline, Cadavers Direct, will be established. Specially trained teams of town criers will tour affected areas shouting 'Oyez, oyez, you've all got three days, tops'. \"The government will be doing everything it can to assure our European partners, and citizens of the United States when it's founded in 300 years time, that Britain is a perfectly safe place to visit. \"Latest statistics from the chief apothecary show that at least half and possibly as many as 60% of the population can expect to survive this outbreak. A small circle of black pustules on the skin is no reason to delay your holiday! \"Visitors from abroad can also continue to enjoy all our traditional rural pastimes, including bear-baiting, throwing stones at the village idiot, wench-deflowering and public executions. \"Let the message go forth: Britain is open for business!\" And Labour is about to be returned to office. When the Tories' Archie Norman mildly suggested that there might be a bill to enable the local elections to be postponed if needs be, Mr Meacher was outraged. \"The idea that the whole country is in quarantine, and that democracy has to be suspended, is not an image we wish to project!\" So if foreign tourists can't go near the animals, at least they can follow our thrilling election campaign from the safety of their locked hotel rooms. Or possibly not. What's going on?

      "bodyText": "A footpath which crosses land on which millionaire Nicholas van Hoogstraten is building his own palace near Uckfield in East Sussex must be reopened, Lewes magistrates ordered yesterday in the first case under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. The case brought after a complaint by Kate Ashbrook, of the Ramblers' Association, was against Rarebargain Ltd, a company which owns a small amount of land on the edge of Hamilton Palace estate. The company was fined \u00a34,000, but more important from the ramblers' point of view was the order that the barbed wire, locked gates and a refrigeration unit be removed within 28 days and the barn built across the 140-year-old path removed within six months. Under the act, which came into force on January 30, the power to order removal of obstruction passed from East Sussex council to the courts, and this was the first time such a power has been exercised. Ms Ashbrook was delighted. \"This is the legislation we have been waiting for to force reluctant landlords to obey the law and remove obstructions to rights of way,\" she said. Mr van Hoogstraten has resisted all attempts to get obstructions removed from the existing path, which crosses his 200 acre estate, a mile from Uckfield. David Engleheart, solicitor for Mr van Hoogstraten, said that his client was in Zimbabwe. He did not own Rarebargain, on whose land the obstructions stood, although Hamilton Palace Ltd, in which his client did have an interest, owned the land round about.",

She started working with clay on the suggestion of therapists in London; now she not only makes her own pots - with just one hand - but helps other people in need of therapy. Next month, an exhibition of her work is to be staged at a gallery in south London. </p> <p>Herrera was 16 in 1973, studying Chilean Indian art; she was a young communist and an active supporter of president Salvador Allende. She was helping to organise distribution of food to Santiago's poorer districts and was general secretary of a women's print union. On the morning of the coup, she was at her father's printing works when soldiers burst in, arrested her and took her by lorry to the notorious Chile Stadium in Santiago. </p> <p>She was to be held there for three and a half years, enduring interrogation, torture and rape. \"They burned my hand with hot oil to make me talk... but you get to a point that you just don't care and you know what is coming,\" she recalls. \"You try to help each other because there are always some people who need more help than others. </p> <p>\"At the beginning it is terrible because you are so scared. You don't know what is going to happen to you. They used to come around at three o'clock in the morning and say: 'All out'. And the captain - or whatever he was - said 'That one, that one, that one', and 'Shoot them'. And so you were there every night and you never know when they would shoot you. The worst thing is when you see other people being killed - especially the old people, just because they were old. It was really bad for about two and a half years. After that it was less.\" </p> <p>Herrera started to write poetry on scraps of paper, which she hid until her release when she gave them to a UN representative to smuggle out of jail. She was released into the hands of the UN and taken by car to Buenos Aires where she was given the choice of five countries to go to as a political refugee. She picked Britain, and flew into Heathrow airport on June 12, 1977. </p> <p>Initially she lived in a hotel in Notting Hill Gate, west London, with about 42 other Chileans, and became involved with the Chile Solidarity Campaign, on the printing side. But there was no one that she could talk to about what she had suffered. \"In my country, if for any reason you are raped then nobody wants to talk to you because they blame you even if it is not your fault. I tried to talk about it but they told me to shut up,\" she says. </p> <p>In 1979 she was moved to a big estate in Tulse Hill, south London. Somehow the estate reminded her of the stadium, and she was lonely: shortly after the move she made her first suicide attempt, cutting her wrists. A neighbour found her, her wrists were patched up and she was taken to the Bethlem hospital in south London. She saw a psychiatrist but her English, she says, was poor and they spoke only briefly. A psychologist wanted her to place figures on a board, and make word associations. She thought it ridiculous, refused to take part and was put on Mogadon, she says. </p> <p>Her second suicide attempt was in 1993, prompted by the news of the death of a close Chilean friend in a farm accident. Herrera was doing copper work with a Stanley knife, and immediately slashed her wrists. Again she ended up at the Bethlem hospital but this time treatment was very different. She saw a psychologist (whom she is still seeing) and a psychiatrist who encouraged her to talk about what had happened in Chile. And she was offered occupational therapy in the form of pottery. </p> <p>Having lost the use of her left hand in the suicide attempt, at first she didn't want to know. \"I was annoyed that I was still alive,\" she says. Then she saw another patient holding a cigarette in one hand and coiling clay in long rolls with the other. \"I thought I can try that_ You stroke the clay down to cover the joints and then you do the inside as well, and so it's not going to break,\" she says, describing how she taught herself from books about ceramic art. </p> <p>She had lost her job in printing while she was in Bethlem and was at a loss what to do after being discharged, with the result that she was back within six weeks. \"There was nothing for me to do. I am not a person to sit down in front of the television. I have to use my brain and my hands. My consultant had a word with the lady in charge of OT [occupational therapy] and I was allowed to come back here once a week. And I started coming every day. I wasn't supposed to be here.\" </p> <p>She was doing her own work and also, as a volunteer, helping others to learn pottery in the arts workshop, which is run by trained artists for the 350 in-patients under the charge of the OT department. Each week about 100 patients pass through the workshop. </p> <p>\"If there was no project, I'm sure I wouldn't be here- or I would be here as a patient,\" says Herrera, 45. \"This is my life now. I can't live without it because I enjoy it so much, giving pleasure to others. I am trying just to show them what I know. It's not going to work for everyone, but because I was a patient I know what they are going through. That's the main thing - to help others.\" </p> <p>Her pots come in all shapes, sizes and colours. They and the designs draw heavily on three months she spent as a young student with Indians in the south of Chile when she was learning about their culture, art and traditional symbols. \"It reminds me of my people and I like the colours. I think the reason is, when you've been through so much, everything is black and white. I think it's that I want to see that life is not only black and white.\" </p> <p>Bibi Herrera's exhibition of pottery and poetry, Staying Alive, will run from April 6 to May 4 at the Bethlem Gallery, Bethlem Royal Hospital, Monks Orchard Road, Beckenham, Kent.

      "body": "<p>Janice and David Ryan have been married 10 years. Five of those were spent living with David's mum, waiting for a council house in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, for themselves and their children Tiffany and Jason, now six and three. </p> <p>Like thousands of people on council waiting lists across the country, the Ryans filled in forms sent by the local authority from time to time, asking them if they still wanted to be on the list and if their circumstances had changed. But they heard nothing back. Then, last April, Harborough district council introduced a new way of allocating homes to the 1,000 people on its housing register. Nine months later, the Ryans moved into a three-bedroom, semi-detached council house. </p> <p>Instead of the traditional points system, which invariably puts homeless families and teenage mothers at the front of the housing queue, and gives housing officers sole control over who is allocated which property, Harborough Home Search is based on the principle of consumer choice. </p> <p>Each fortnight, a newsletter advertising the latest vacant homes arrived on the Ryans' doormat, inviting them to view any of the council and housing association properties that met their requirements. \"Most of them were unsuitable,\" says Janice. \"They were out of town, or bungalows for older people, but I was sure that if we hung on something was bound to turn up.\" </p> <p>They finally spotted their ideal home in the December newsletter, completed a form to register their interest, and a couple of weeks later were invited for a viewing. \"We said 'yes' straight away and, to our surprise, were told we could move in the following month after the rewiring had been done,\" says Janice. </p> <p>The Ryans were lucky. Not everyone on the housing register will be successful. While this affluent part of the East Midlands does not suffer from a social housing shortage on the scale of London or the south-east, the ratio of applicants to properties is still two to one; each week, about 40 applicants chase 20 homes. First choice goes to people issued with a time-limited priority card, followed by those longest on the housing register. </p> <p>Home Search has supplied cards to 100 households which, under the old points system, would have been at the front of the queue. This gives them three months to pick a home. Yet many have forgone this priority status, preferring to wait like everyone else for suitable accommodation, instead of taking what's on offer within 12 weeks. </p> <p>To date, 500 properties have been advertised through Home Search, most of which have been snapped up, and 80% of participants say they prefer it to the old system. </p> <p>Tim Brown, director of the centre for comparative housing research at De Montfort University, which is evaluating the Harborough pilot and two similar schemes in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, and Caerphilly, south Wales, says the value of the choice-based lettings approach is that it opens up a hitherto impenetrable system. </p> <p>\"The schemes have the important advantages of openness, transparency and accountability,\" says Brown. They do not raise unrealistic expectations, he insists. \"When people are able to see all the vacancies in an area, they will understand far better the lack of available social housing. In the whole of Harborough there are only 23 four-bedroom houses, so people will have to make realistic choices.\" </p> <p>Harborough council and its three housing association partners are hoping to develop Home Search so that vacancies are advertised on a website as well as in the newsletter. They have applied to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) for funding. Next week, along with 91 other bidders, they will hear whether their pitch is one of the 20 or so chosen to secure a share of the government's \u00a311m to support choice-based lettings schemes. </p> <p>This idea was promoted by the housing green paper, issued in April last year. \"Our objectives are to empower people to make decisions over where they live and exercise choice; help create sustainable com munities and encourage the effective use of the nation's stock,\" it said. </p> <p>The DETR has been impressed with the number and quality of the 94 bids - covering areas of low, as well as high, demand for social housing. Oldham has teamed up with Manchester, Rochdale and a number of housing associations and private landlords in the north-west in a bid to expand \"instant homes\" - an estate agent approach to marketing empty properties. </p> <p>In its first 11 months, the scheme - operating from a shop and a website - has let 360 homes owned by Oldham council. The only criteria a prospective tenant must meet is that they need somewhere to live. In a region plagued by low demand for all types of rented accommodation, the council believes all sectors must work together not only to give applicants more choice, but to revitalise the rented sector's tarnished image. </p> <p>But where housing demand is very high, how can choice help tenants who have been stuck on waiting lists for years? In its response to the green paper, the Association of London Government (ALG) said it could not, and described choice-based lettings as \"clearly inappropriate in most of London\". Yet, a year on, 12 London boroughs have put in bids to the DETR, spurred by the success of a choice-based approach pioneered in Holland and followed closely in Harborough. </p> <p>This so-called Delft model has operated since the early 1990s in areas of Holland where housing is hard to find. In Utrecht, where 75,000 people are on the housing register, 6,000 units of housing are advertised each year. On average, there are 34 responses to each advertisement. As a result, the typical time on the register is between four and five years. </p> <p>Mike Morris, chief executive of the William Sutton Trust, a housing association which is part of a London and south-east consortium bid to the DETR, says the issue is how to ration a scarce resource in a more humane way - not how to produce more homes. \"This is about humanising lettings and getting rid of the dependency culture that we as bureaucrats have bred by taking responsibility,\" he says. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Kensington and Chelsea council in west London - one of the trust's local authority partners - has a shortfall of 4,400 social houses and flats and 840 homeless families living in hostels and bed and breakfast accommodation. It hopes the proposed central register of landlords' vacant properties will increase housing options outside the borough. Another consortium, led by Hammersmith and Fulham council, also in west London, hopes to make it easier for tenants of 10 landlords to transfer across borough boundaries - a feat that has been likened to scaling the Berlin wall - while a proposal from the once sceptical ALG and Homes, the nationwide transfer agency, wants to offer the capital's waiting list applicants the choice of a home and a job up north. </p> <p>Whoever wins DETR funding next week, it seems that the way social housing is let will never be the same again. Many of the choice-based bids are so well developed that they are likely to be implemented even without extra funding. Few will mourn the points system. </p> <p>One important lesson from Holland is that injecting choice creates more sustainable communities. Janice Ryan says: \"If you've chosen your home yourself, it feels like your own place and it's worth making it nice and getting on with the neighbours.\" </p> <p><strong>Queue for change</strong></p> <p>More than 1m households are on local authority housing waiting lists in England alone, according to the most recent annual figures. </p> <p>Of the total, more than 800,000 are registered as \"in need\", including 325,000 with or expecting children and 130,000 with special needs. </p> <p>Almost 200,000 households are on waiting lists in London alone, including 86,000 with or expecting children, and 116,000 in the rest of the south-east. More than 160,000 are on lists in the Yorkshire and Humberside region. </p> <p>Official figures last week showed that the number of households living in bed and breakfast accommodation has soared 22% in a year, standing now at 9,860. In 1999, this type of emergency housing cost the state \u00a3152m. </p> <p>Housing charity Shelter is calling for a national target to cut the use of bed and breakfast accommodation. Chris Holmes, the charity's director, says: \"Bed and breakfasts do not provide families with security, stability or a chance to create a settled environment.\" </p> <p><strong> David Brindle</strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>The crisis in European agriculture caused by foot and mouth comes at a critical moment - Monday sees the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiators gathering in Geneva to start the \"reform\" of the agreement on agriculture. </p> <p>With the epidemic of foot and mouth in the UK - the latest in a series across the globe, which are both disrupting trade and ruining many farmers - fundamental questions should at last be addressed about what should be in this agreement. </p> <p>It is exactly the larger farm sizes, bigger herds, and trading and shipment of livestock over long distances, which the WTO rules encourage that has created the problems the EU is currently experiencing. </p> <p>One of the first thoughts of agriculture minister Nick Brown, when he realised what the rapid sheep movements round Britain meant for the spread of foot and mouth, was that the whole system of modern livestock farming needed to be reviewed. This must include WTO rules that treat animals as a commodity. </p> <p>The outcome of this renegotiation will have an impact on farmers throughout the world: the decisions will determine how our food is produced and traded, how we address issues of food shortages, and the extent to which farmers can be subsidised and supported. They will determine whether or not the environmental costs of intensive agriculture will worsen, the world's small-scale farmers will survive or go to the wall, and countries will be free to promote more socially and environmentally sustainable agricultural practices. Alternatively, they may result in farmers being pushed into cutting yet more corners in order to force the immediate costs of food production still lower. </p> <p>The external costs of intensive agriculture - costs which are borne by society at large, rather than being reflected directly in the price of food - are colossal. Increased farm size under agricultural policies which discriminate against small-scale producers, increased international movement of produce and an intensification of production methods all tend to drive these external costs even higher, while leaving livestock and crops more vulnerable to pest and disease outbreaks. Although seen to be more \"efficient\", agriculture that depends on intensified use of external inputs - pesticides and fertilisers - and undermines the livelihoods of rural communities, is, of course, far from that. Intensive agricultural systems all too frequently exhaust those resources which are least renewable - soil, soil nutrients, and water. They may also entail huge social expense in accommodating those displaced from rural communities. </p> <p>Agricultural intensification also has a direct impact on the environment. Loss of crop biodiversity entails increasing susceptibility to climatic fluctuations, vulnerability to pest outbreaks and increased reliance upon pesticides. The increased use of crop varieties dependent on higher levels of fertiliser has accelerated the loss of soil minerals. Water courses have become polluted, and soils degraded. The costs of addressing these impacts - cleaning water courses following contamination with pesticides or fertiliser run-off, for example - are immense but not paid for by farmers or the multinational companies that trade in food and animal products. But there are also the unquantifiable costs of biodiversity loss - the collapse of populations of farmland birds, for example. </p> <p>These problems are not specific to developed countries. Misplaced agriculture trade policies are now exported worldwide. The drive for international competitiveness has forced many third world farmers to grow new and unfamiliar crops for export markets, undermining local food security and leaving them vulnerable to crop failure. Farmers in Andhra Pradesh in India, who recently planted large areas with a single cotton hybrid that proved particularly susceptible to insect attack, faced uncontrollable pest outbreaks and insurmountable loans. Some resorted to killing themselves, drinking the pesticides intended for their fields. </p> <p>Poorly targeted interventionist policies can generate as many problems as wholesale subscription to the liberalisation agenda. Under the European common agricultural policy (CAP), production-linked subsidies have encouraged over-production, and have benefited those who produce most. With half of the CAP subsidies going to the top 17% of producers, such payments have driven intensification while failing to reduce the economic vulnerability of many farmers. </p> <p>The renegotiation of the WTO agreement on agriculture, which is likely to drag on for several years, presents an opportunity to address problems such as the misplaced use of subsidies and the drive to liberalise markets in agricultural produce. </p> <p>Over the course of the last few months, countries have been submitting their preliminary negotiating proposals to the WTO. Many developing countries - particularly those struggling to produce sufficient foodstuffs to provide for their domestic needs - identify the importance of finding ways in which small-scale domestic producers can be protected from cheap produce imported from elsewhere. Food insecurity threatens more than 800m people worldwide and is best addressed through local food production. But it is increasingly based on the availability of imported food, which is frequently under-priced as a result of financial incentives for over-production in developed countries, or the provision of export subsidies. </p> <p>The reliability of such imports is contingent on uninterrupted transportation, and the recipient having an ongoing supply of hard currency. Failure to compete with cheap imports has undermined the production of staple foodstuffs and threatens the future of rural communities in many developing countries. </p> <p>Trade policies must be constructed in such a way that they do not infringe the rights of countries to choose sustainable local production for domestic food security over and above the production of commodities for world markets. This flies in the face of the drive to liberalise markets in agricultural produce. Some countries that champion the unfettered market - at least in terms of their rhetoric - have preferred to offer the third world increased access for commodity export to markets in the North. Developing countries should not settle for such palliatives where they are bought at the cost of further erosion of their national food \"sovereignty\". </p> <p>The RSPB thinks that the renegotiation of the agreement on agriculture should go far further. These reforms present an opportunity to begin to address the need to move towards more sustainable methods of production across the world. Current payments which support domestic production, used mainly by the OECD countries, should be more clearly targeted at environmental and rural development goals. Subsidies which merely promote increased production should be abolished. </p> <p>In presenting their negotiating proposals, no country so far has identified the need for freedoms to permit the discrimination of imports on the basis of the sustainability of their production. To the WTO, restrictions on the import of produce on the grounds of methods of production is anathema. At present, WTO rules lead to production practices which wring out every possible short-term saving in the course of trying to produce more cheap food - irrespective of the environmental and social costs. </p> <p>Over the last few weeks, we have been confronted by the enormity of the knock-on impacts when things go wrong with our means of food production. Changing the way we produce food will require fundamental changes in our obligations under the WTO. The opportunity presented for such changes by the renegotiation of the agreement on agriculture must not be lost. Unless the drive towards an ever freer market is moderated, high external input agriculture will continue to wreck the environment without proper internalisation of the true costs, small farmers worldwide will continue to go to the wall as the biggest grow bigger, and the domestic food security of developing countries will continue to be undermined. </p> <p>Tom Crompton is the RSPB's policy officer for global agriculture and is author of Eat This: Fresh Ideas on the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, a new report by the RSPB. <a href=\"tom.crompton@rspb.org.uk\"> tom.crompton@rspb.org.uk</a></p>",

Alternatively, they may result in farmers being pushed into cutting yet more corners in order to force the immediate costs of food production still lower. The external costs of intensive agriculture - costs which are borne by society at large, rather than being reflected directly in the price of food - are colossal. Increased farm size under agricultural policies which discriminate against small-scale producers, increased international movement of produce and an intensification of production methods all tend to drive these external costs even higher, while leaving livestock and crops more vulnerable to pest and disease outbreaks. Although seen to be more \"efficient\", agriculture that depends on intensified use of external inputs - pesticides and fertilisers - and undermines the livelihoods of rural communities, is, of course, far from that. Intensive agricultural systems all too frequently exhaust those resources which are least renewable - soil, soil nutrients, and water. They may also entail huge social expense in accommodating those displaced from rural communities. Agricultural intensification also has a direct impact on the environment. Loss of crop biodiversity entails increasing susceptibility to climatic fluctuations, vulnerability to pest outbreaks and increased reliance upon pesticides. The increased use of crop varieties dependent on higher levels of fertiliser has accelerated the loss of soil minerals. Water courses have become polluted, and soils degraded. The costs of addressing these impacts - cleaning water courses following contamination with pesticides or fertiliser run-off, for example - are immense but not paid for by farmers or the multinational companies that trade in food and animal products. But there are also the unquantifiable costs of biodiversity loss - the collapse of populations of farmland birds, for example. These problems are not specific to developed countries. Misplaced agriculture trade policies are now exported worldwide. The drive for international competitiveness has forced many third world farmers to grow new and unfamiliar crops for export markets, undermining local food security and leaving them vulnerable to crop failure. Farmers in Andhra Pradesh in India, who recently planted large areas with a single cotton hybrid that proved particularly susceptible to insect attack, faced uncontrollable pest outbreaks and insurmountable loans. Some resorted to killing themselves, drinking the pesticides intended for their fields. Poorly targeted interventionist policies can generate as many problems as wholesale subscription to the liberalisation agenda. Under the European common agricultural policy (CAP), production-linked subsidies have encouraged over-production, and have benefited those who produce most. With half of the CAP subsidies going to the top 17% of producers, such payments have driven intensification while failing to reduce the economic vulnerability of many farmers. The renegotiation of the WTO agreement on agriculture, which is likely to drag on for several years, presents an opportunity to address problems such as the misplaced use of subsidies and the drive to liberalise markets in agricultural produce. Over the course of the last few months, countries have been submitting their preliminary negotiating proposals to the WTO. Many developing countries - particularly those struggling to produce sufficient foodstuffs to provide for their domestic needs - identify the importance of finding ways in which small-scale domestic producers can be protected from cheap produce imported from elsewhere. Food insecurity threatens more than 800m people worldwide and is best addressed through local food production. But it is increasingly based on the availability of imported food, which is frequently under-priced as a result of financial incentives for over-production in developed countries, or the provision of export subsidies. The reliability of such imports is contingent on uninterrupted transportation, and the recipient having an ongoing supply of hard currency. Failure to compete with cheap imports has undermined the production of staple foodstuffs and threatens the future of rural communities in many developing countries. Trade policies must be constructed in such a way that they do not infringe the rights of countries to choose sustainable local production for domestic food security over and above the production of commodities for world markets. This flies in the face of the drive to liberalise markets in agricultural produce. Some countries that champion the unfettered market - at least in terms of their rhetoric - have preferred to offer the third world increased access for commodity export to markets in the North. Developing countries should not settle for such palliatives where they are bought at the cost of further erosion of their national food \"sovereignty\". The RSPB thinks that the renegotiation of the agreement on agriculture should go far further. These reforms present an opportunity to begin to address the need to move towards more sustainable methods of production across the world. Current payments which support domestic production, used mainly by the OECD countries, should be more clearly targeted at environmental and rural development goals. Subsidies which merely promote increased production should be abolished. In presenting their negotiating proposals, no country so far has identified the need for freedoms to permit the discrimination of imports on the basis of the sustainability of their production. To the WTO, restrictions on the import of produce on the grounds of methods of production is anathema. At present, WTO rules lead to production practices which wring out every possible short-term saving in the course of trying to produce more cheap food - irrespective of the environmental and social costs. Over the last few weeks, we have been confronted by the enormity of the knock-on impacts when things go wrong with our means of food production. Changing the way we produce food will require fundamental changes in our obligations under the WTO. The opportunity presented for such changes by the renegotiation of the agreement on agriculture must not be lost. Unless the drive towards an ever freer market is moderated, high external input agriculture will continue to wreck the environment without proper internalisation of the true costs, small farmers worldwide will continue to go to the wall as the biggest grow bigger, and the domestic food security of developing countries will continue to be undermined.

      "body": "<p>Getting heroin users to admit they need medical help is a key factor in determining whether they can overcome their addiction. So imagine the frustration of addicts and their families when, having made that crucial step, they face a waiting list for treatment of several months. By the time their turn for treatment arrives, many will have given up waiting and may be either untraceable or have lost their resolve. </p> <p>According to Mark McPherson, operations manager at addiction charity Turning Point, this is a frequent occurrence. \"Drug users aren't like people waiting for a hip transplant - they can't just sit at home until the hospital is ready for them,\" he says. \"Drug users can have very chaotic lifestyles. Time and time again when their turn comes up, we have lost track of them.\" </p> <p>As with many NHS services, the problem stems from lack of manpower and resources. Many heroin addicts are helped by methadone maintenance programmes, requiring regular doctors' prescriptions of the legal drug so that patients can stabilise their habit, then gradually reduce the dose. A shortage of specialist clinics, where doctors will prescribe methadone, is a key factor causing waiting lists to build up. </p> <p>There is, however, an alternative solution. The country's 36,000 GPs are legally allowed to prescribe methadone - and, it can be argued, they are ideally placed to help drug users. A GP is cheaper than a hospital doctor and will often know the heroin user and his or her family personally. </p> <p>However, very few GPs are willing to prescribe methadone. Simon Fradd, a member of the GPs' committee of the British Medical Association (BMA), says many doctors have had - or have heard of - off-putting experiences with drug users. \"Many drug addicts are extremely manipulative and many GPs get drawn into this area without adequate training,\" he says. \"Sometimes the addicts can start selling the methadone or may overdose on it - and then the doctor may find themselves up before the General Medical Council in danger of being struck off.\" </p> <p>Some GPs are also put off by the labour-intensive nature of treating drug users, at a time when their workload seems to be ever increasing. And others may even believe that their time is better spent on patients whose condition is not \"their own fault\". </p> <p>McPherson says: \"I'm sure there are prejudices about it. Drug users are certainly not being embraced by GPs. There's a sort of fear of the risks that they pose - to the GP and also to themselves.\" </p> <p>Not all family doctors refuse to treat drug users. A new scheme in Middlesbrough is expected to treat 500 users at one practice. But in some parts of the country, particularly rural areas, there is a dearth of any GPs willing to prescribe methadone. </p> <p>McPherson says: \"In areas where there isn't a visible drug problem, GPs say it isn't a priority for them. One GP claimed to me there weren't any addicts in his area and I knew there were at least 20. The irony is that rural areas are the very places where primary care services are most needed, because the hospitals are further away.\" </p> <p>Recently, however, there have been signs that attitudes among GPs are changing. The BMA and the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) - the two main groups representing family doctors - have agreed a policy statement acknowledging that GPs have a role to play in this area. It says that drug users should be able to get their basic health services from GPs and specialist treatment from either hospital doctors or GPs, stressing that family doctors \"should offer appropriate care to all patients on their lists\". </p> <p>The RCGP is also setting up special training courses for GPs, teaching them how to prescribe methadone safely and recommending techniques for ensuring they are not fooled by users into overprescribing. To encourage GPs to take the courses, the government has made money available to help them cover the cost of hiring locum doctors when they are absent from their surgeries. </p> <p>Clare Gerada, a south London GP who has set up her own clinic for treating drug users, hopes that all these measures will encourage growing numbers of family doctors to take on this field of work. She describes the BMA/RCGP statement as a \"watershed\" in attitudes to methadone prescribing, saying: \"We are coming of age. At last we will start playing our part.\" </p> <p>Gerada, who has advised the Department of Health on drug abuse policies, says: \"Drug users prefer to receive their treatment from us. We're community based, open at all hours, and accessed through self-referral. We are also used to treating the different needs of patients - social, physical, and psychological. GPs should be the backbone of treatment services.\" </p> <p>The government seems to be using the carrot-and-stick approach to getting family doctors to shoulder more of the burden of treating drug users. As well as helping GPs get training, the health department is in the process of setting up a new agency to set standards and monitor services across England. </p> <p>From April, the national treatment agency, as it will be called, will assess both specialist and GP services to ensure certain standards are being met within local areas. The quality of addiction services varies notoriously. One of the agency's aims will be to bring all areas up to national targets. Although the exact standards have not yet been decided, Gerada says a realistic aim would be to ensure that a minimum number of GPs within a given area is willing to prescribe methadone. That way, family doctors who choose not to work in this field would be able to refer their patients on to colleagues who do. </p> <p>One model is to provide \"shared care\", where GPs do some of the work, with back-up from hospital doctors for some of the more time-consuming and specialist services. The ultimate aim is to ensure that primary care services no longer abandon responsibility for this vulnerable patient group. </p> <p>Gerada says: \"If GPs refer drug users on to someone up the road who has more training in methadone prescribing, that's fine. But they should not just refuse because they don't like the patients. We need to see patients like human beings, as opposed to some sort of Martian.\" </p> <p>The Guardian, together with Turning Point and Pavilion Publishing, is staging a major conference on the national treatment agency and its implications. The event will be in London on June 21. Details from Pavilion on 01273-623222.</p> <p><strong>The habits of a generation</strong></p> <p>Latest official figures show an estimated rise of 7% in just six months in the number of people coming forward for help with drug habits. </p> <p>The figures show that more than 39,000 people in Britain presented to drug treatment agencies for the first time, or the first time for six months, in the six-month period ending March 31 last year. Just over half were in their 20s and a further one in seven was even younger. </p> <p>Heroin was the most frequently reported main drug of use, in 61% of cases, and methadone accounted for another 11%. Men outnumbered women drug users by three to one. </p> <p>Of almost 34,000 episodes of treatment provided in England alone during the period - almost double the number in an equivalent six months in 1993 - just over 1,800 were reported by GPs. The great majority (more than 26,600) were delivered by community-based drugs services. </p> <p>Analysis of the 1998 British Crime Survey, the most recent to have been studied, showed that 14% of men and 8% of women admitted using drugs in the previous year. In the 16-24 age range, however, these proportions rose respectively to 36% and 25%. </p> <p>Overwhelmingly, the drug of use was cannabis. Only 1% of people of all ages admitted to having ever used heroin, but 9% said they had taken cocaine. </p> <p>Despite the survey's confidentiality, the figures are likely to have been underestimates. Home Office researchers calculated on the basis of the findings that up to 2m people in England and Wales had used some kind of drug in the previous year</p> <p><strong>David Brindle</strong></p>",

Simon Fradd, a member of the GPs' committee of the British Medical Association (BMA), says many doctors have had - or have heard of - off-putting experiences with drug users. \"Many drug addicts are extremely manipulative and many GPs get drawn into this area without adequate training,\" he says. \"Sometimes the addicts can start selling the methadone or may overdose on it - and then the doctor may find themselves up before the General Medical Council in danger of being struck off.\" Some GPs are also put off by the labour-intensive nature of treating drug users, at a time when their workload seems to be ever increasing. And others may even believe that their time is better spent on patients whose condition is not \"their own fault\". McPherson says: \"I'm sure there are prejudices about it. Drug users are certainly not being embraced by GPs. There's a sort of fear of the risks that they pose - to the GP and also to themselves.\" Not all family doctors refuse to treat drug users. A new scheme in Middlesbrough is expected to treat 500 users at one practice. But in some parts of the country, particularly rural areas, there is a dearth of any GPs willing to prescribe methadone. McPherson says: \"In areas where there isn't a visible drug problem, GPs say it isn't a priority for them. One GP claimed to me there weren't any addicts in his area and I knew there were at least 20. The irony is that rural areas are the very places where primary care services are most needed, because the hospitals are further away.\" Recently, however, there have been signs that attitudes among GPs are changing. The BMA and the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) - the two main groups representing family doctors - have agreed a policy statement acknowledging that GPs have a role to play in this area. It says that drug users should be able to get their basic health services from GPs and specialist treatment from either hospital doctors or GPs, stressing that family doctors \"should offer appropriate care to all patients on their lists\". The RCGP is also setting up special training courses for GPs, teaching them how to prescribe methadone safely and recommending techniques for ensuring they are not fooled by users into overprescribing. To encourage GPs to take the courses, the government has made money available to help them cover the cost of hiring locum doctors when they are absent from their surgeries. Clare Gerada, a south London GP who has set up her own clinic for treating drug users, hopes that all these measures will encourage growing numbers of family doctors to take on this field of work. She describes the BMA/RCGP statement as a \"watershed\" in attitudes to methadone prescribing, saying: \"We are coming of age. At last we will start playing our part.\" Gerada, who has advised the Department of Health on drug abuse policies, says: \"Drug users prefer to receive their treatment from us. We're community based, open at all hours, and accessed through self-referral. We are also used to treating the different needs of patients - social, physical, and psychological. GPs should be the backbone of treatment services.\" The government seems to be using the carrot-and-stick approach to getting family doctors to shoulder more of the burden of treating drug users. As well as helping GPs get training, the health department is in the process of setting up a new agency to set standards and monitor services across England. From April, the national treatment agency, as it will be called, will assess both specialist and GP services to ensure certain standards are being met within local areas. The quality of addiction services varies notoriously. One of the agency's aims will be to bring all areas up to national targets. Although the exact standards have not yet been decided, Gerada says a realistic aim would be to ensure that a minimum number of GPs within a given area is willing to prescribe methadone. That way, family doctors who choose not to work in this field would be able to refer their patients on to colleagues who do. One model is to provide \"shared care\", where GPs do some of the work, with back-up from hospital doctors for some of the more time-consuming and specialist services. The ultimate aim is to ensure that primary care services no longer abandon responsibility for this vulnerable patient group. Gerada says: \"If GPs refer drug users on to someone up the road who has more training in methadone prescribing, that's fine. But they should not just refuse because they don't like the patients. We need to see patients like human beings, as opposed to some sort of Martian.\" The Guardian, together with Turning Point and Pavilion Publishing, is staging a major conference on the national treatment agency and its implications. The event will be in London on June 21. Details from Pavilion on 01273-623222. The habits of a generation Latest official figures show an estimated rise of 7% in just six months in the number of people coming forward for help with drug habits. The figures show that more than 39,000 people in Britain presented to drug treatment agencies for the first time, or the first time for six months, in the six-month period ending March 31 last year. Just over half were in their 20s and a further one in seven was even younger. Heroin was the most frequently reported main drug of use, in 61% of cases, and methadone accounted for another 11%. Men outnumbered women drug users by three to one. Of almost 34,000 episodes of treatment provided in England alone during the period - almost double the number in an equivalent six months in 1993 - just over 1,800 were reported by GPs. The great majority (more than 26,600) were delivered by community-based drugs services. Analysis of the 1998 British Crime Survey, the most recent to have been studied, showed that 14% of men and 8% of women admitted using drugs in the previous year. In the 16-24 age range, however, these proportions rose respectively to 36% and 25%. Overwhelmingly, the drug of use was cannabis. Only 1% of people of all ages admitted to having ever used heroin, but 9% said they had taken cocaine. Despite the survey's confidentiality, the figures are likely to have been underestimates. Home Office researchers calculated on the basis of the findings that up to 2m people in England and Wales had used some kind of drug in the previous year David Brindle",

      "body": "<p>New local government reforms will raise the profile of council leaders and improve decision-making and accountability. But as councillors become community champions, rather than committee fodder as at present, they will find their roles constrained by the physical layout of town halls designed for a rather different mode of running our towns and cities. </p> <p>We need a new generation of town halls to put councils at the centre of civic renewal - buildings designed to promote local government's new values of accountability, inclusiveness and transparency, and help close the gap between citizens and representatives. Councils should consult their communities about designing these buildings to reflect the present and future aspirations of towns and cities. </p> <p>As a preparatory step, experts in local government, architecture and civic renewal are taking part in a project, organised by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) and the Design Council, to investigate how local government can promote its new values through architecture and, specifically, the ways in which the new town hall can reinvigorate community democracy and civic debate. </p> <p>Many existing British town halls are impressive, beautiful landmarks built by the Victorians in a spirit of optimism. It was the heyday of prestige for elected representatives. Town halls were built in celebration of municipal prosperity and unity, councillors competing with rival towns for the most ostentatious seat of power. They were an affirmation of local government and expressed civic pride in the town and its councillors alike. </p> <p>The buildings sustained and encouraged this boosterish attitude, and helped to build up a sense of identity and community in burgeoning Victorian towns. They were opened with huge celebrations, were widely used by the local people, and formed a focal point for the community. Many of these splendid municipal piles survive: they're well-known, well-used and well-loved. But, in planning their replacements more in tune with the needs of communities in the 21st century, care must be taken not to lose these positive associations. </p> <p>Victorian town halls were constructed to awe and even intimidate visitors with their opulence, and they also imply the elitism and the impregnable nature of the council's proceedings and its members and officials. They were constructed around a large central hall, surrounded by offices and often without windows. The insular, secretive and decadent implications of such buildings - for instance, Manchester's town hall - are precisely what the modernisation of local government seeks to get away from. </p> <p>By contrast, the evolution of local government in the post-war decades produced buildings which emphasised the functional and administrative role of councils. Town halls were designed more functionally as administrative spaces, without showy trappings. The council chamber itself was now sidelined, often tucked at the back of the building. Town halls of this period were run as large office complexes - often laid out to meet the needs of staff rather than citizens. But with our current emphasis on public engagement in scrutiny, these buildings are not satisfactory either. To have decision-making processes and scrutiny panels meeting in the least accessible part of the building creates an unhelpful impression of the balance of power and of the council's attitude to transparency. </p> <p>The design of a building has a profound effect on its atmosphere and the behaviour of those inside it. A transparent meeting space which the public can access at any time is likely to encourage a more open and efficient style of council meeting. </p> <p>A town hall conceived on these lines would tip the balance away from political theatrics, and towards practical solutions. When building the new Reichstag in Berlin, after the reunification of Germany, Sir Norman Foster, a British architect, put a glass-domed roof over the parliament chamber, which was below ground level, so that the public could literally look down on the politicians. </p> <p>The effects of this symbolism on the relationship between electors and elected should not be underestimated. If the council chamber is at the back of the building, councillors' perception of their roles will tend to focus on administration and bureaucracy; if the chamber is in the midst of the community, the community-leader role will be more dominant. It is hard to be outward-looking and open-minded in a closed room without windows. The interests of the community will be more immediate when you can see locals outside. </p> <p>So the design and the utilisation of our new civil offices should focus on serving the community. There should be a one-stop shop for all council services, and there should be extensive space for galleries, community projects - and for just chatting with friends and neighbours. To include shops and other facilities, such as creches, would encourage wider use and recognition of the area - although the space should be regarded primarily as a place for democracy and community. </p> <p>The government has put forward proposals to modernise and streamline civil law courts. Court buildings could be included in the new town halls, so that the justice system could also benefit from the atmosphere of transparency and accountability. Town halls should welcome all tiers of government, as well as other community groups or quangos, with an emphasis on promoting interaction between the different groups and sharing resources. This could go some way towards addressing the democratic deficit in the NHS, the police and quangos. </p> <p>Local MPs and MEPs could hold their surgeries in the building. Community groups or school groups could hold public meetings within specially designed areas. And space could also be set aside as a Speaker's Corner, to allow members of the public to voice their own political opinions. </p> <p>The construction of a new town hall is a forward-looking, exciting project which will arouse local interest and is a good way to renew inter est in public participation. Large-scale architectural projects also bring publicity and recognition to an area. The prize-winning Peckham library, south London, designed by Alsop &amp; Stormer, is an example of a public building bringing positive media attention to an area of urban deprivation. </p> <p>Instead of looking back to the glory of former days, local government needs to take up its place in the democratic spaces of the future. </p> <p>Matthew Taylor is director of IPPR and Becky Hatch is an IPPR researcher.</p> <p><strong>Pattern of democracy</strong></p> <p>Playing at Kubla Khan is the last thing on the minds of most contemporary councillors, who doubt the public's enthusiasm for any more large town halls, however full of access ramps and glass roofs they may be. </p> <p>\"People still write to the local paper complaining that we knocked the old one down,\" says Colin Anderson, leader of Sunderland city council, which boasts the biggest - and perhaps architecturally best - civic centre of the late 20th century. </p> <p>Flooded with light, and Babylonian in its wealth of gentle terraces, indoor galleries and tumbling plants, the building was designed by Sir Basil Spence, of Coventry Cathedral fame, with very democratic ideas in mind. Spence once explained that his pattern of hexagons was designed to be \"informal and allowing free pedestrian movement to all parts\". </p> <p>This works, says Anderson, in terms of the courtyards in the middle of the hexagons - and the absence of puffed-up civic pride. He says: \"The centre is big, but not overwhelming. It has more of the air of an office block than anything grandiose.\" </p> <p>After only 30 years, though, the centre is being renovated, partly to help the public find their way through a well-intentioned but bewildering arrangement of approach paths and ramps. </p> <p>Council taxpayers quite properly want the council to come to them, rather than to set out its stall on a central hill. Anderson says: \"We've surely seen the end of the golden age of building new town halls. The real answer is to devolve our services to local centres; to give people mini-town halls on their doorstep.\" </p> <p>This is what has happened in Leeds, which has possibly the most grandiose town hall in Britain, though now it is used only for concerts and conferences. The staff the public need to reach - for benefits, housing or environmental issues - are accessible in 13 \"one-stop shops\" across the city. </p> <p>This change has been so successful that the results were featured, ironically, in a Channel 4 probe into stress, which showed what happens when public inquiries rise from 290 to 700 a day, but staff numbers fail to keep pace. Even at the height of the queues, though, the main one-stop building in the centre of Leeds was registering satisfaction rates of more than 60%. </p> <p>That rate has now reached 95% - an increase helped by the smart conversion of two redundant schools and a former printing works by Leeds civic architect John Thorp. \"We were saving three listed Victorian buildings, but the entrances needed to be welcoming, bright and especially visible, so you can see the staff before you go inside,\" Thorp says. \"It's a matter of changing the buildings' mood, and I think we have.\" </p> <p>What matters most is that the flagship one-stop shop in Leeds makes good financial sense. Opened in 1995, just before the city's boom in property prices, the conversion cost \u00a37m - and saved \u00a312m through staff moves from other dreary premises. The freehold is worth \u00a314m to the city council. \"We haven't sold the family silver,\" says Thorp. \"We've found a way of using it to make more.\" </p> <p><strong>Martin Wainwright</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "New local government reforms will raise the profile of council leaders and improve decision-making and accountability. But as councillors become community champions, rather than committee fodder as at present, they will find their roles constrained by the physical layout of town halls designed for a rather different mode of running our towns and cities. We need a new generation of town halls to put councils at the centre of civic renewal - buildings designed to promote local government's new values of accountability, inclusiveness and transparency, and help close the gap between citizens and representatives. Councils should consult their communities about designing these buildings to reflect the present and future aspirations of towns and cities. As a preparatory step, experts in local government, architecture and civic renewal are taking part in a project, organised by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) and the Design Council, to investigate how local government can promote its new values through architecture and, specifically, the ways in which the new town hall can reinvigorate community democracy and civic debate. Many existing British town halls are impressive, beautiful landmarks built by the Victorians in a spirit of optimism. It was the heyday of prestige for elected representatives. Town halls were built in celebration of municipal prosperity and unity, councillors competing with rival towns for the most ostentatious seat of power. They were an affirmation of local government and expressed civic pride in the town and its councillors alike. The buildings sustained and encouraged this boosterish attitude, and helped to build up a sense of identity and community in burgeoning Victorian towns. They were opened with huge celebrations, were widely used by the local people, and formed a focal point for the community. Many of these splendid municipal piles survive: they're well-known, well-used and well-loved. But, in planning their replacements more in tune with the needs of communities in the 21st century, care must be taken not to lose these positive associations. Victorian town halls were constructed to awe and even intimidate visitors with their opulence, and they also imply the elitism and the impregnable nature of the council's proceedings and its members and officials. They were constructed around a large central hall, surrounded by offices and often without windows. The insular, secretive and decadent implications of such buildings - for instance, Manchester's town hall - are precisely what the modernisation of local government seeks to get away from. By contrast, the evolution of local government in the post-war decades produced buildings which emphasised the functional and administrative role of councils. Town halls were designed more functionally as administrative spaces, without showy trappings. The council chamber itself was now sidelined, often tucked at the back of the building. Town halls of this period were run as large office complexes - often laid out to meet the needs of staff rather than citizens. But with our current emphasis on public engagement in scrutiny, these buildings are not satisfactory either. To have decision-making processes and scrutiny panels meeting in the least accessible part of the building creates an unhelpful impression of the balance of power and of the council's attitude to transparency. The design of a building has a profound effect on its atmosphere and the behaviour of those inside it. A transparent meeting space which the public can access at any time is likely to encourage a more open and efficient style of council meeting. A town hall conceived on these lines would tip the balance away from political theatrics, and towards practical solutions. When building the new Reichstag in Berlin, after the reunification of Germany, Sir Norman Foster, a British architect, put a glass-domed roof over the parliament chamber, which was below ground level, so that the public could literally look down on the politicians. The effects of this symbolism on the relationship between electors and elected should not be underestimated. If the council chamber is at the back of the building, councillors' perception of their roles will tend to focus on administration and bureaucracy; if the chamber is in the midst of the community, the community-leader role will be more dominant. It is hard to be outward-looking and open-minded in a closed room without windows. The interests of the community will be more immediate when you can see locals outside. So the design and the utilisation of our new civil offices should focus on serving the community. There should be a one-stop shop for all council services, and there should be extensive space for galleries, community projects - and for just chatting with friends and neighbours. To include shops and other facilities, such as creches, would encourage wider use and recognition of the area - although the space should be regarded primarily as a place for democracy and community. The government has put forward proposals to modernise and streamline civil law courts. Court buildings could be included in the new town halls, so that the justice system could also benefit from the atmosphere of transparency and accountability. Town halls should welcome all tiers of government, as well as other community groups or quangos, with an emphasis on promoting interaction between the different groups and sharing resources. This could go some way towards addressing the democratic deficit in the NHS, the police and quangos. Local MPs and MEPs could hold their surgeries in the building. Community groups or school groups could hold public meetings within specially designed areas. And space could also be set aside as a Speaker's Corner, to allow members of the public to voice their own political opinions. The construction of a new town hall is a forward-looking, exciting project which will arouse local interest and is a good way to renew inter est in public participation. Large-scale architectural projects also bring publicity and recognition to an area. The prize-winning Peckham library, south London, designed by Alsop &amp; Stormer, is an example of a public building bringing positive media attention to an area of urban deprivation. Instead of looking back to the glory of former days, local government needs to take up its place in the democratic spaces of the future. Matthew Taylor is director of IPPR and Becky Hatch is an IPPR researcher. Pattern of democracy Playing at Kubla Khan is the last thing on the minds of most contemporary councillors, who doubt the public's enthusiasm for any more large town halls, however full of access ramps and glass roofs they may be. \"People still write to the local paper complaining that we knocked the old one down,\" says Colin Anderson, leader of Sunderland city council, which boasts the biggest - and perhaps architecturally best - civic centre of the late 20th century. Flooded with light, and Babylonian in its wealth of gentle terraces, indoor galleries and tumbling plants, the building was designed by Sir Basil Spence, of Coventry Cathedral fame, with very democratic ideas in mind. Spence once explained that his pattern of hexagons was designed to be \"informal and allowing free pedestrian movement to all parts\". This works, says Anderson, in terms of the courtyards in the middle of the hexagons - and the absence of puffed-up civic pride. He says: \"The centre is big, but not overwhelming. It has more of the air of an office block than anything grandiose.\" After only 30 years, though, the centre is being renovated, partly to help the public find their way through a well-intentioned but bewildering arrangement of approach paths and ramps. Council taxpayers quite properly want the council to come to them, rather than to set out its stall on a central hill. Anderson says: \"We've surely seen the end of the golden age of building new town halls. The real answer is to devolve our services to local centres; to give people mini-town halls on their doorstep.\" This is what has happened in Leeds, which has possibly the most grandiose town hall in Britain, though now it is used only for concerts and conferences. The staff the public need to reach - for benefits, housing or environmental issues - are accessible in 13 \"one-stop shops\" across the city. This change has been so successful that the results were featured, ironically, in a Channel 4 probe into stress, which showed what happens when public inquiries rise from 290 to 700 a day, but staff numbers fail to keep pace. Even at the height of the queues, though, the main one-stop building in the centre of Leeds was registering satisfaction rates of more than 60%. That rate has now reached 95% - an increase helped by the smart conversion of two redundant schools and a former printing works by Leeds civic architect John Thorp. \"We were saving three listed Victorian buildings, but the entrances needed to be welcoming, bright and especially visible, so you can see the staff before you go inside,\" Thorp says. \"It's a matter of changing the buildings' mood, and I think we have.\" What matters most is that the flagship one-stop shop in Leeds makes good financial sense. Opened in 1995, just before the city's boom in property prices, the conversion cost \u00a37m - and saved \u00a312m through staff moves from other dreary premises. The freehold is worth \u00a314m to the city council. \"We haven't sold the family silver,\" says Thorp. \"We've found a way of using it to make more.\" Martin Wainwright",

But the survey shows considerable variation: in relative terms, Stockport manages to recycle more than 30 times as much as its neighbour Manchester; similarly, in Northamptonshire, Daventry recycles 25 times the proportion achieved by Corby. </p> <p>The biggest disparity in services surveyed is the time taken to give a decision on planning applications by householders. The best of the London boroughs, Newham, manages to process 85% of applications within the eight-week target set by government. The worst, Haringey in north London, achieves only 20%. </p> <p>The report, which looks at performance in 1999-2000, the last year before the \"best value\" regime took effect, reveals that some of the best performing councils are not necessarily doing well across the board. While Islington, in north London, achieves a 100% inspection rate of high-risk food premises, it is placed bottom of the capital league when it comes to the number of public conveniences, managing just two per 100,000 residents. This compares to 20 per 100,000 residents in Greenwich, south London. </p> <p>Away from towns and cities, the commission looked at footpaths and other rights of way and assessed how easy it was for the public to use them. It found a marked drop in ease of access in county council areas: only 70% of them are deemed user-friendly, a 5% deterioration over two years. </p> <p>Sir Andrew Foster, the commission's controller, says most councils have risen to the challenge of improving services that affect every resident in their areas. \"Nevertheless, some councils have a lot of work to do to catch up with the better performers. Best value is shining an ever brighter spotlight to show local people how their councils are performing and what improvements could be made.\" </p> <p>Local Authority Performance Indicators 1999-2000: Environmental Services in England is available at \u00a320 from Audit Commission Publications on 0800 502030.</p>",

Possibly the most dramatic improvement has been in the recycling of household waste, which has doubled since the mid-1990s. But the survey shows considerable variation: in relative terms, Stockport manages to recycle more than 30 times as much as its neighbour Manchester; similarly, in Northamptonshire, Daventry recycles 25 times the proportion achieved by Corby. The biggest disparity in services surveyed is the time taken to give a decision on planning applications by householders. The best of the London boroughs, Newham, manages to process 85% of applications within the eight-week target set by government. The worst, Haringey in north London, achieves only 20%. The report, which looks at performance in 1999-2000, the last year before the \"best value\" regime took effect, reveals that some of the best performing councils are not necessarily doing well across the board. While Islington, in north London, achieves a 100% inspection rate of high-risk food premises, it is placed bottom of the capital league when it comes to the number of public conveniences, managing just two per 100,000 residents. This compares to 20 per 100,000 residents in Greenwich, south London. Away from towns and cities, the commission looked at footpaths and other rights of way and assessed how easy it was for the public to use them. It found a marked drop in ease of access in county council areas: only 70% of them are deemed user-friendly, a 5% deterioration over two years. Sir Andrew Foster, the commission's controller, says most councils have risen to the challenge of improving services that affect every resident in their areas. \"Nevertheless, some councils have a lot of work to do to catch up with the better performers. Best value is shining an ever brighter spotlight to show local people how their councils are performing and what improvements could be made.\" Local Authority Performance Indicators 1999-2000: Environmental Services in England is available at \u00a320 from Audit Commission Publications on 0800 502030.",

It is the sort of rehearsal familiar to amateur performers, but for a group including murderers, sex offenders and violent burglars, to be doing this in a high security prison is highly unusual. </p> <p>But Grendon prison, in Buckinghamshire, is unusual: the only British prison offering a therapeutic regime of education and personal development for up to 230 inmates. Men can ask to be transferred here from other institutions. If they are assessed as suitable, it takes 18 to 24 months for the programme to show results, says education officer Jill Lewis, who prefers to describe the regime as challenging rather than liberal. </p> <p>The group running the workshop is out of the ordinary, too. The six classical musicians of the Oxford Concert Party (OCP) have been working in prisons, hospitals, hospices and residential homes for almost a decade. They are basically a chamber ensemble with a sense of humour, describ ing themselves as Europe's only baroque and tango orchestra. They have done tours and TV, and been voted pick of the fringe at the Edinburgh Festival. </p> <p>As well as composing and recording music, and playing the accordion and harpsichord, artistic director Arne Richards is an authority on music for healing. \"There's no deep philosophy behind it, but music does have great transformative power,\" he says. \"Certain types of music can help people, where other types can have a negative effect. For instance, physically handicapped people may react badly to music with a strong rhythmic content. In a prison, you can soon see what does or does not work. </p> <p>\"There's a highly charged atmosphere in a place like Whitemoor [high-security prison in Cambridgeshire]. To harness that high energy through music is a most wonderful experience. We've seen people in tears, tapping their feet, laughing for joy, no matter how reluctant they were before the performance.\" </p> <p>The potential effect of professional musicians working with prisoners became clear when, as violinist Isabel Knowland, Richards's wife, explains, they found after one of their first prison concerts that the men wanted the \"hands-on communication\" of trying the instruments. And so the workshops started. </p> <p>It remains a mystery to Richards how, after the chaos of the first two sessions, the pieces the inmates have brought to play or sing, and the improvisations he gives them, always cohere into a smooth third session and then a final performance - all accomplished within eight hours. </p> <p>The aim is clear: to increase the men's self-confidence and sharpen their sense of identity. It is the policy of governor Tim Newell to invite music and other groups to supplement Grendon's core education programme. Lewis is sure the workshops bring results. \"It's a definite learning curve for [prisoners] to realise they can entertain other people,\" she says. \"There's a definite growth in self- esteem, when the law has told you you're a load of rubbish.\" </p> <p>By the second session of the workshop, some of that confidence has begun to emerge. So has rather a lot of talent. George is rehearsing his bagpipes solo; Noel, with recent events in mind, has written a dramatic poem about a rail disaster, for which OCP musicians will provide a soundtrack; John is playing the electric guitar; Tom, as well as having poems published in OCP's newsletter, is going through his saxophone solo. </p> <p>The two hours are broken into a time for improvising in small groups. Each is given a theme, such as a circus or a procession, which will be interspersed into a longer work Richards and his musicians will play at the concert. Sounds weird, but Richards is a great blender and bender of world music. He might include in the programme anything from Argentinian tangos to Irish laments, but he says it always works. </p> <p>The buzz starts early in the session. There is a soundtrack of drumming, but, strangely, no one is letting rip. It's all taut self-controlled. Richards does not raise his voice and hardly seems to be pulling things together, but a process is at work. </p> <p>George, serving a sentence for a murder he committed at 16, has performed at previous workshops. \"The first time, the adrenalin was running down my back,\" he recalls. But don't other inmates get annoyed by the wailing pipes when he is practising? \"If you're liked, you can get away with anything,\" he grins. </p> <p>Grendon, which has an education budget of \u00a3400,000 (shared with Spring Hill prison on the same site) pays for a local RAF pipe major to coach George. John, similarly, has lessons with a professional guitarist. He, too, is inside for a murder committed as a teenager - \"a paedophile abusing kids in my area,\" he says. </p> <p>The guitar has been his salvation; he has been passionate about it since he was 16. Now, through the opportunity to play in prison, he sees himself as a guitarist, with a plausible career he hopes to take up on his release. </p> <p>But for all the relative liberalism of the regime, and a timetable which allows men out of their cells for most of the day, these are pent-up men. John, taking a break with a roll-up and a mug of black coffee, says it is difficult to relate to others in the group who are at different levels \"musically and intellectually\". </p> <p>Despite such frustrations, music has been his saviour. \"When I started, it was a bit of an ego trip,\" says John. \"I wanted to play rock guitar. But after two years, it became more genuine. But it's not about competing; it's about working as a team.\" </p> <p>The team, in turn, is part of a wider community of music. For Grendon has its graduates: two former prisoners, who have participated in workshops, have returned to help with this one. One, a former sex offender, will be singing an aria or two in the final concert. Another was sent to Grendon for protesting at nuclear bases; he is now a music student at Oxford Brookes University, and says OCP's workshops impressed him because they're \"all very egalitarian; everyone gets a chance to do a piece\". </p> <p>Some unlikely characters turn up, too. Knowland says: \"Some of the men are very musical and skilled. But some haven't touched an instrument in their lives, or heard anything that wasn't either rock or pop.\" </p> <p>The only puzzle is that, of the circle in the gym, only about a dozen are prisoners. A pity that such an excellent project (it costs \u00a33,000 to stage a workshop) does not get bigger numbers. \"There are other things on tonight,\" explains one participant. \"It clashes with their programmes.

Ministers, he says, will fail to achieve their aim of a huge increase in volunteering unless voluntary organisations are resourced to offer management and leadership. </p> <p>Anticipating the argument that state funding of core costs would undermine charities' independence, Bubb says: \"We would need to make clear that one of our rules is that we remain free to criticise. We don't expect the government to come back with: 'We don't like what you say; what chance your next revenue grant?'\" </p> <p> Funding Our Future is available at \u00a325 inc. from Acevo, Middlesex House, 130 College Road, Harrow, HA1 1BQ (020-8424 2334).</p>",

Unwin proposes three models of funding to break the mould: \"full project\" funding, in which all reasonable associated costs are built in; \"development\" funding, through which infrastructure costs are met for a time in order to enable the service provider to grow and develop; and \"strategic\" funding, by which a funder recognises a need for the provider to exist to meet its own (the funder's) objectives and is prepared to contribute over an agreed period of time. Bubb is keen to take the debate still wider. Ministers, he says, will fail to achieve their aim of a huge increase in volunteering unless voluntary organisations are resourced to offer management and leadership. Anticipating the argument that state funding of core costs would undermine charities' independence, Bubb says: \"We would need to make clear that one of our rules is that we remain free to criticise. We don't expect the government to come back with: 'We don't like what you say; what chance your next revenue grant?'\" Funding Our Future is available at \u00a325 inc. from Acevo, Middlesex House, 130 College Road, Harrow, HA1 1BQ (020-8424 2334).",

This gap has revealed itself in a variety of ways. </p> <p>First, there has been a tendency to spray the demand for 'private-sector involvement' across most new government initiatives in the areas of social and regeneration policy without proper consideration of what the different partners would have to offer. This has fuelled partnership-fatigue rather than unleashing new energy and innovations. </p> <p>Second, the suspicion that PPPs are being used simply to get public investment 'off-balance sheet' still persists strongly on the ground. Third, the view that the private sector should be used as a punishment with which to threaten 'failing' public authorities (for example, LEAs, prisons, benefits offices, schools) has created a jaundiced view of the very notion of partnership. </p> <p>Fourth, the early evidence from PFI projects suggests many are offering at best marginal value for monetary gains without delivering the promised innovations in design and service configuration. Finally, in a number of high-profile instances, including the London Underground and National Air Traffic Services, the government has made an almost ideological commitment to very particular models of PPP while turning its back on other partnership arrangements. </p> <p>No one should think that resolving these problems and building effective partnerships is easy. In all of the areas where diversity has been introduced there have been teething problems. In some instances the quality of service provided through PPP has been lamentable or the tax-payer has received a poor deal (often they go together). Anyone who claims that, in every instance, the quality of service produced through a PPP supersedes what came before is wilfully misinterpreting the available evidence. </p> <p>The evidence of the apparent shortcomings of both PPPs and direct-provision underlines the need to ensure that genuine alternatives to PPPs remain in place (and are perceived to be viable alternatives by public managers). There is also a need to reform the PPP approval process in order to improve quality and value for money. </p> <p>And yet, despite all these concerns and caveats, there is little reason for anticipating that a return to a 'one size fits all' model of public sector provision would benefit citizens. </p> <p>The concept of partnership between the sectors is not flawed, but often the practice has been. If managed properly, the gradual shift towards greater diversity in service-provision has the potential to generate favourable outcomes. We are not alone in holding this view. Few serious commentators are calling for the nationalisation of service provision in areas where a plurality of providers already exists. </p> <p>Where these changes will take us is not yet clear. The 'industrial organisation', as economists term it, of the emerging public service sector will vary from area to area.

In all areas the era of the single, all encompassing, monolithic public provider seems to be passing.

      "body": "<p>Mrs Thatcher couldn't resist a man in uniform. While teachers, civil servants and town hall officials were frequent targets of prime ministerial ire, the armed services and the fire service escaped virtually scot free. </p> <p>The few bits of the public sector which the Conservative government liked have tended to do rather well in the pay stakes. Police and fire officers enjoy relatively generous pay and pension schemes - senior police officers earn more than the average lawyer, government figures show, while senior firestation officers are further up the pay ladder than accountants. </p> <p>Unions representing other parts of the public sector say they have not been so lucky. Twenty five years ago, a teacher could expect to earn nearly 40% more than the average non manual worker. Today the gap has narrowed to just 10%, according to the National Union of Teachers. University lecturers say that while the average wage packet has grown by nearly 50% since 1980, allowing for the effects of inflation, their pay has only increased by 5%. </p> <p>Despite union complaints, official data shows that on average public sector workers still earn more than private sector employees, but this in part reflects the fact that two decades of privatisation and outsourcing have changed the face of the state sector. Most low-paid manual jobs - garbage disposal, hospital cleaning - have been contracted out. Successive waves of privatisation have resulted in a total of 750,000 workers moving from the public sector to the private sector. </p> <p>The typical public sector worker now is a female professional - 60% of public sector workers are women. By contrast, the private sector is made up of well paid male professionals, very poorly paid female service sector workers, and a declining number of male manual workers. </p> <p>The few manual workers left in the public sector do relatively well by comparison with their private sector counterpart which is why they were scarcely affected by the introduction of the minimum wage - few of them were earning anywhere near the \u00a33.70 wage floor. </p> <p>For professional workers, it's a different story. Pay for private sector professionals has ballooned in the 1990s, widening the gap between top earners and the low paid. But the pay packets of professional workers in the public sector have not kept pace. The pay review bodies which set wages for most of the public sector have become a tool for government economic management - pay makes up about a third of government spending. The Conservatives operated a pay freeze, where any increases had to be paid for with job cuts, a policy which Labour continued for the first two years it was in power. Since then the Treasury has urged the pay review bodies to keep settlements consistent with the Bank of England's 2.5% inflation target. </p> <p>Private sector employers couldn't get away with this kind of tight-fistedness. Workers would simply find a better deal elsewhere. But because the government is a monopoly employer when it comes to nursing and teaching, it is able to artificially suppress wages. </p> <p>But even the government can't avoid market pressures for ever. Workers can always leave or retire, and that's what they've been doing in droves. Underpaid and overstretched, nurses and teachers have simply voted with their feet, causing a recruitment crisis which the government has belatedly woken up to. </p> <p> The government has promised a better salary deal starting this April. Nurses' pay is set to rise by 3.7% with higher rises for senior nurses and allied professions. School teachers will also receive a basic rise of 3.7%, while new recruits will get a 6% increase. </p> <p>Will this be enough to solve the recruitment crisis? The unions, while welcoming the cash are sceptical. The NUT says it will still be hard to attract good graduates into the profession, even with the higher pay rates. </p> <p>The starting salary for a good honours graduate in teaching on the new pay scale will be \u00a317,000, around \u00a31,800 less than graduates in other professions. Three years after graduating, a teacher will be earning just over \u00a319,000 compared with nearly \u00a327,000 for typical graduates in other sectors. Five years after graduating the gap has widened further, with a teacher earning just over \u00a322,000 while graduates in other sectors are averaging more than \u00a333,000. </p> <p>The teachers unions are also looking enviously at their Scottish counterparts who are set to enjoy a much more generous deal after an independent inquiry into pay concluded that higher salaries were needed to restore teachers' professional status. As a result, Scottish teachers will see their pay packets grow by more than 23% over the next three years. Recruiting in England and Wales could become even harder when more attractive pay rates are on offer north of the border. </p> <p>So what should the government do? First, it needs to recognise that better standards in the key public services will mean paying higher wages to attract better graduates. At the same time it wants to achieve reforms, and more money will ease the pain of widespread upheavals. </p> <p>The opportunity to increase salaries is there with the extra money Gordon Brown is pumping into health and education over the next three years. But so far most of the spending has been earmarked for special projects. Some of the extra cash isgoing to have to go into pay packets, not just for new recruits but existing staff as well to stop them leaving. </p> <p>As Mrs Thatcher once observed, you can't buck the market.</p>",

The few manual workers left in the public sector do relatively well by comparison with their private sector counterpart which is why they were scarcely affected by the introduction of the minimum wage - few of them were earning anywhere near the \u00a33.70 wage floor. For professional workers, it's a different story. Pay for private sector professionals has ballooned in the 1990s, widening the gap between top earners and the low paid. But the pay packets of professional workers in the public sector have not kept pace. The pay review bodies which set wages for most of the public sector have become a tool for government economic management - pay makes up about a third of government spending. The Conservatives operated a pay freeze, where any increases had to be paid for with job cuts, a policy which Labour continued for the first two years it was in power. Since then the Treasury has urged the pay review bodies to keep settlements consistent with the Bank of England's 2.5% inflation target. Private sector employers couldn't get away with this kind of tight-fistedness. Workers would simply find a better deal elsewhere. But because the government is a monopoly employer when it comes to nursing and teaching, it is able to artificially suppress wages. But even the government can't avoid market pressures for ever. Workers can always leave or retire, and that's what they've been doing in droves. Underpaid and overstretched, nurses and teachers have simply voted with their feet, causing a recruitment crisis which the government has belatedly woken up to. The government has promised a better salary deal starting this April. Nurses' pay is set to rise by 3.7% with higher rises for senior nurses and allied professions. School teachers will also receive a basic rise of 3.7%, while new recruits will get a 6% increase. Will this be enough to solve the recruitment crisis? The unions, while welcoming the cash are sceptical. The NUT says it will still be hard to attract good graduates into the profession, even with the higher pay rates. The starting salary for a good honours graduate in teaching on the new pay scale will be \u00a317,000, around \u00a31,800 less than graduates in other professions. Three years after graduating, a teacher will be earning just over \u00a319,000 compared with nearly \u00a327,000 for typical graduates in other sectors. Five years after graduating the gap has widened further, with a teacher earning just over \u00a322,000 while graduates in other sectors are averaging more than \u00a333,000. The teachers unions are also looking enviously at their Scottish counterparts who are set to enjoy a much more generous deal after an independent inquiry into pay concluded that higher salaries were needed to restore teachers' professional status. As a result, Scottish teachers will see their pay packets grow by more than 23% over the next three years. Recruiting in England and Wales could become even harder when more attractive pay rates are on offer north of the border. So what should the government do? First, it needs to recognise that better standards in the key public services will mean paying higher wages to attract better graduates. At the same time it wants to achieve reforms, and more money will ease the pain of widespread upheavals. The opportunity to increase salaries is there with the extra money Gordon Brown is pumping into health and education over the next three years. But so far most of the spending has been earmarked for special projects. Some of the extra cash isgoing to have to go into pay packets, not just for new recruits but existing staff as well to stop them leaving. As Mrs Thatcher once observed, you can't buck the market.",

But it was pupils and patients who paid the price through overcrowded classes and overlong NHS waiting lists. </p> <p>Except in a few areas and specialisms, managers of these public enterprises were not technically short of staff because they did not have enough money in their budgets to pay for any more. They lived within their ration. </p> <p>Since Gordon Brown moved two years ago to lift the lid on public expenditure, the legacy of 20 years of low levels of training, recruitment and nurturing of public sector staff has started to hit home. </p> <p>The signs are everywhere. Spanish nurses who started work this year at hospitals in Blackpool, Blackburn, Morecambe and Preston were the advance guard of a contingent of 5,000 that the NHS has agreed with the authorities in Madrid can be poached to relieve a chronic shortage of skilled workers in the wards. Hospitals are reporting difficulties in the recruitment of psychiatrists, radiologists and pathologists. Schools in London would collapse without the services of temping teachers from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa who used to provide sickness cover for regular staff, but are now becoming the bedrock of the education service. </p> <p>Directors of social services are looking abroad to find social workers after the home-grown supply dried up. Essex has recruited 46 from South Africa and is looking for 24 more. </p> <p>The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, has reported a shortage of 1,000 staff and warned that 200 fully fit officers would have to be switched from frontline duties to fill vacant support posts. Even the Ministry of Defence is reported to be considering relaxing its tough fitness requirements for new recruits to make up a shortage that has left the army, navy and air force nearly 10,000 below strength. </p> <p><strong> Across the boundaries</strong><br> </p> <p> The shortage extends into professions that straddle the boundaries of public and private sectors. According to a survey by Incomes Data Services, local authorities are experiencing recruitment and retention difficulties in accounting and finance, building control, engineering, environmental health and planning. </p> <p>And the problem is not confined to professionals. Councils are reporting problems across a range of low-paid occupations including care staff, cleaners, cooks and leisure staff. In Coventry the council said it could not find enough home carers because staff got better pay for less onerous work in the supermarkets. In Guildford the council offered a \"market supplement\" of \u00a31.20 an hour above the nationally agreed rate to hang on to its footloose cooks. </p> <p>For the unions, there is an appealing explanation for these difficulties. Pay increases in the public sector have fallen behind those in the private and the gap has become more troublesome as falling unemployment opened up more opportunities for people to switch sectors in search of higher pay. Since 1995 average earnings rose by 18.5% in the public sector and 25.5% in the private. That trend was continuing last year when public sector earnings went up by 3.7% and private by 4.3%. Latest official figures put average earnings in the public sector at \u00a3406.60 a week, slightly below the private sector average of \u00a3412.30. </p> <p>That gap is bound to have had an effect on employment patterns in areas of low unemployment that were spreading from London and the south-east into East Anglia, the Midlands, the south-west and parts of Scotland around Edinburgh and Aberdeen. And the pressure came as the public sector was trying to increase its workforce for the first time in 20 years. </p> <p>The number of public jobs fell from more than 7.4m in 1979 to below 5m in 1997, mainly due to the privatisation of nationalised industries. Between 1989 and 1999 it rose by 44,000, mainly due to recruitment by the NHS and primary schools. </p> <p>These aggregate statistics cannot be used to prove that public sector workers are underpaid. At the level of the individual school, hospital or office, more complex factors are at play. Among teachers, for example, a lowering of morale caused by excessive paperwork and the drip feed of criticism from Ofsted may have done at least as much as pay rates to swell an exodus of experienced staff. Managers in the public sector have to ask themselves whether they have done enough to introduce family-friendly employment policies. </p> <p><strong> Annual ritual</strong><br> </p> <p> Arguments about public sector staff shortages have become part of an annual ritual in the run up to decisions by the pay review bodies on how much the main professions should get. </p> <p>The unions play them for all they are worth and the government - until recently - tried to pretend they did not really exist. But over the last 12 months, there were signs that ministers were taking the problem more seriously. In Scotland, there were three-year pay deals worth 23.1% for teachers and more than 18% plus bonuses for civil servants. In England, education ministers offered \u00a34,000 golden hellos for newly-qualified teachers specialising in maths, science, technology and modern languages. Police officers and nurses in high-cost areas got supplementary allowances. And the Budget produced recruitment and retention funds worth \u00a3200m for education over the next three years and \u00a3130m for health. </p> <p>These are probably the most worrying areas because shortages of teachers and NHS staff could derail the government's priority programmes - and the time lags for training new staff are long. </p> <p>The nurses recruited from Spain join thousands of others from South Africa, the Philippines, New Zealand, the West Indies and Zimbabwe who have been poached by Britain to solve the problem of unfilled vacancies. Last year the number of foreign nurses and midwives registering to work in Britain increased by 48% to a record 7,361. Almost a third of nurses in London's hospitals trained abroad. The NHS would collapse without them. </p> <p>The Royal College of Nursing estimates that 22,000 posts are vacant for lack of suitably qualified applicants. But the government is pressing ahead with proposals in the NHS plan to create an extra 20,000 nursing posts by 2004. </p> <p>A study by Queen Margaret University College concluded that the NHS would have to recruit 110,000 registered nurses and midwives over this period to make up for those leaving the profession and meet the target growth. Bearing in mind likely patterns of recruitment, training and persuasion of former nurses to return, nobody is yet clear how these numbers will be achieved without further raiding of staff from overseas. </p> <p>However, the trade in nurses is a two-way flow and there is no guarantee that Britain will be a net importer. </p> <p>No wonder Alan Milburn, the health secretary, said the main problem facing the NHS was no longer shortage of money, but shortage of capacity. Mr Milburn will also have difficulties delivering the extra 7,500 consultants, 1,000 spe cialist registrars and 2,000 GPs promised by 2004 in the NHS plan. </p> <p>The British Medical Association said it was hard to fill vacancies for radiologists, pathologists, anaesthetists and paediatricians, although the evidence was anecdotal. The most glaring shortages were in mental health. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, more than 20% of consultant posts were unfilled in the North-west and Mersey, 17% in Yorkshire and 8% in East Anglia, Oxford, Wessex and most regions in Scotland. </p> <p>\"Psychiatrists from abroad, with appropriate induction, can only be viewed as a short-term solution to a major recruitment problem. Unless this dilemma is resolved, the delivery of the _ NHS plan over a short time scale is almost impossible,\" the college said. </p> <p><strong> Unfilled posts</strong><br> </p> <p> And in education, the shortages are getting worse. A survey of headteachers in February found nearly 10,000 unfilled posts in secondary schools in England and Wales, an increase of 150% on five months before. Although the highest vacancy rates were in London and the south-east, the Secondary Heads Association said problems were becoming more serious in the Midlands and north-east. </p> <p>Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of School masters Union of Women Teachers, said the overall shortage of teachers was probably between 20,000 and 30,000. The gap was partly filled by supply teachers, mostly from abroad. </p> <p>In past years, teachers from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada provided temporary cover when permanent staff went sick. But now they were being used to fill long-term vacancies. \"These overseas teachers are good kids, but they come and go. They are not the right way to staff schools permanently because their turnover is too high,\" Mr de Gruchy said. </p> <p>Tish Seabourne, managing director of the teacher supply agency TimePlan, said 60% of the staff on her payroll were from overseas, rising to 75% in London. A recent recruitment drive in South Africa attracted 140 for the borough of Tower Hamlets. Waltham Forest was getting 70 from Australia. Other authorities are targeting New Zealand and Canada. </p> <p>And the shortages are hitting hard at school leadership. John Howson, an educational employment analyst, said 60% of inner London schools failed to appoint a head when they first advertised last year - and in the north-west more than a quarter of schools had similar problems. </p> <p>The government's response is to expand the number of training places for teachers and medical staff. It tries to plug gaps by targeting specific groups. For example, the latest Budget initiatives extended the golden hellos to English teachers. There will also be a \u00a35,000 golden hello for newly-qualified GPs working in \"under-doctored\" areas and a \u00a310,000 golden handcuff bonus for GPs continuing to work from 60 to 65. It is too soon to say whether these inducements will be enough to turn the tide. </p> <p>Underfunding of the public sector is commonly associated with a collapsing physical infrastructure, but the lack of qualified and motivated workers who make up the human infrastructure may be harder to remedy than a shortage of buildings or equipment.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Two years ago I sat on a House of Lords Select Committee which examined the state of our public services. We found that the reforms of the Thatcher government in the 1980s had been deep and profound. Hundreds of thousands of people were moved from the public service into agencies and privatised companies. New tests of efficiency were imposed. Costs were cut. Yet our major conclusion was that the ethos of public service had survived the trauma. Somewhat to our surprise we found public servants who retained a concept of impartial service and public duty which Northcote and Trevelyan would have recognised when they reformed our public services 150 years ago. </p> <p>If, then, we still have the men and women to do the job properly, do we have the political will to provide a well rewarded, well motivated public service? Can we achieve the public and political consensus to avoid the public service equivalent of stop-go and give instead a decade or more of consistent policy on which to build organisations attuned to 21st century needs? Is such consensus possible after 20 years in which the future of our public services has been the subject of bitter political differences? </p> <p>On the eve of another general election the battle positions of all three parties have a vaguely 20th century air about them. Labour, having kept to spending limits which even the Conservatives would probably have abandoned, is loosening the purse strings while secretly fearing that extra resources will be swallowed by pent-up pay demands instead of producing improvements in service. The use of targets which proved such lethal weapons in opposition - targets fpr for class sizes, hospital waiting lists and police numbers - has a nasty habit of back-firing in government. </p> <p>The Tories realise that the public no longer has enough faith in Thatcherite dogma to believe that the private sector holds the answers to our public service needs. In a mirror image of Labour's tax and spend apostasy, various pledges are put in place about the sanctity of public services while promised tax cuts have to rely on efficiency savings. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats for their part remain true heirs of Beveridge. They plan to rely on what the prime minister has described as the longest pee in history to finance higher public expenditure by an extra penny on the standard rate of tax. Yet over the rattling of swords as we prepare for battle there is at least the gleam of a consensus of two parties, and perhaps even three. </p> <p>With too many examples of the private sector not delivering still fresh in the mind, the public sector has a chance to state its case to an electorate more welcoming than at any time since the troops came home in 1945 and said \"Never again\" not only to war but to 1930s style poverty. </p> <p>People at large now know we cannot buy ourselves out of the problems of society as a whole with private pension provisions, private schooling, private health without creating other problems for which a bill has to be paid. Yet there is also an acceptance of a role for private thrift and personal responsibility if the behaviour of the feckless and the fraudulent are not to undermine the system and with it taxpayer support. </p> <p>What is silly is to fight long and bloody political wars over the future of the public services. Far better to seek a new consensus on the need for a strong and robust public sector providing a wide range of services, but with the confidence to embrace the best of private sector practices and where it makes sense, partnership. Already there is talk of increasing hypothecation of taxes to increase tax-payer confidence that the taxes they pay go to services they want. There is talk of providing devolved government with greater local tax raising powers to establish its own priorities as to public service needs. A return to consensus would allow public servants to abandon the role of Aunt Sally and embark on a campaign to place the public service at the very heart of a successful society. </p> <p>Such a campaign would require changes in attitude from public servants. London Underground workers would have to find better ways of expressing themselves than bringing the capital to a halt. Teachers would have to resist putting children in the front line of their disputes. A whole range of no-strike agreements would have to be a quid pro quo for a new status and an increased financial commitment from the taxpayer. </p> <p>The building blocs of the new consensus are lying all over the political battlefield. The question is whether anyone has the courage and the vision to gather them and construct a revitalised public service for the 21st century. The alternative is not private affluence and public efficiency. It is private insecurity and public squalor. </p> <p><strong>Tom McNally is home affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords </strong></p>",

Somewhat to our surprise we found public servants who retained a concept of impartial service and public duty which Northcote and Trevelyan would have recognised when they reformed our public services 150 years ago. If, then, we still have the men and women to do the job properly, do we have the political will to provide a well rewarded, well motivated public service? Can we achieve the public and political consensus to avoid the public service equivalent of stop-go and give instead a decade or more of consistent policy on which to build organisations attuned to 21st century needs? Is such consensus possible after 20 years in which the future of our public services has been the subject of bitter political differences? On the eve of another general election the battle positions of all three parties have a vaguely 20th century air about them. Labour, having kept to spending limits which even the Conservatives would probably have abandoned, is loosening the purse strings while secretly fearing that extra resources will be swallowed by pent-up pay demands instead of producing improvements in service. The use of targets which proved such lethal weapons in opposition - targets fpr for class sizes, hospital waiting lists and police numbers - has a nasty habit of back-firing in government. The Tories realise that the public no longer has enough faith in Thatcherite dogma to believe that the private sector holds the answers to our public service needs. In a mirror image of Labour's tax and spend apostasy, various pledges are put in place about the sanctity of public services while promised tax cuts have to rely on efficiency savings. The Liberal Democrats for their part remain true heirs of Beveridge. They plan to rely on what the prime minister has described as the longest pee in history to finance higher public expenditure by an extra penny on the standard rate of tax. Yet over the rattling of swords as we prepare for battle there is at least the gleam of a consensus of two parties, and perhaps even three. With too many examples of the private sector not delivering still fresh in the mind, the public sector has a chance to state its case to an electorate more welcoming than at any time since the troops came home in 1945 and said \"Never again\" not only to war but to 1930s style poverty. People at large now know we cannot buy ourselves out of the problems of society as a whole with private pension provisions, private schooling, private health without creating other problems for which a bill has to be paid. Yet there is also an acceptance of a role for private thrift and personal responsibility if the behaviour of the feckless and the fraudulent are not to undermine the system and with it taxpayer support. What is silly is to fight long and bloody political wars over the future of the public services. Far better to seek a new consensus on the need for a strong and robust public sector providing a wide range of services, but with the confidence to embrace the best of private sector practices and where it makes sense, partnership. Already there is talk of increasing hypothecation of taxes to increase tax-payer confidence that the taxes they pay go to services they want. There is talk of providing devolved government with greater local tax raising powers to establish its own priorities as to public service needs. A return to consensus would allow public servants to abandon the role of Aunt Sally and embark on a campaign to place the public service at the very heart of a successful society. Such a campaign would require changes in attitude from public servants. London Underground workers would have to find better ways of expressing themselves than bringing the capital to a halt. Teachers would have to resist putting children in the front line of their disputes. A whole range of no-strike agreements would have to be a quid pro quo for a new status and an increased financial commitment from the taxpayer. The building blocs of the new consensus are lying all over the political battlefield. The question is whether anyone has the courage and the vision to gather them and construct a revitalised public service for the 21st century. The alternative is not private affluence and public efficiency. It is private insecurity and public squalor. Tom McNally is home affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords",

      "body": "<p>For some the answer to the question we asked yesterday could not be simpler. Indeed, it could be boiled down to two words: more money. Ask those on the front line of public services, and they will often reply the same way. It is a lack of resources, plain and simple, which is preventing them from doing the job they so desperately want to do. The overcrowded classes could become smaller, says the school head, if only the budget could stretch to three new teachers. The cancer rate could come down, says the consultant, if only there was more money to buy hi-tech MRI machines. Prisoners could be out of their cells for longer, says the governor, if only there weren't so few guards on the already-squeezed payroll. </p> <p>Labour has a straightforward response to this straightest of arguments. We agree, they say. That's why we're spending more money now - and promising to spend even more in the future: \u00a344bn in extra departmental spending by 2003-04, with enormous waves of cash pumping into schools and hospitals. </p> <p>Of course we recognise that programme of investment and we have consistently welcomed it But that does not quite end the argument. For the 18-year rundown of our public services under the Conservatives, effectively extended by Labour's two-year adherence to Tory spending limits, left Britain's infrastructure in such a shrivelled condition that even the huge sums promised by the government may not be enough. After two decades of under-investment, at least a decade of investment on an enormous scale is needed now. </p> <p>Such a notion is not extravagant or even fiscally imprudent. Even by 2003-4, we should still be spending less as a share of national income than we were during the Major years. Labour's response is that today's total spend may not look that impressive, but the crucial difference is in where the money's going. While 44p of every public pound used to go toward paying off the national debt and footing the bills of social failure - unemployment benefit and the like - those items now account for just 17p. That 27p difference, says Brown, is being diverted to the neediest and to Britain's public services. </p> <p>That is persuasive, but it misses a crucial change. For we can do more than merely shift the balance within our public spending. We could also spend more, in absolute terms. The nation is getting richer, tax revenues getting larger - thanks in part to the larger numbers now in work and earning a wage rather than living off the state. </p> <p>Even if the right amounts of money were to start flowing into the public realm, the solution would not be complete. There are different views on how the cash should be spent. Take education. The Treasury is quite comfortable discussing extra resources for capital projects - repairing a leaky roof, building a new science lab - and for recruitment, enabling a head to hire an extra teacher or two. But they draw the line at the simplest move of all: making a dramatic increase in current teachers' pay. Even though that would transform Britain's schools, by attracting would-be professionals currently lured to more lucrative pastures elsewhere. Yes, the government is open to performance-related pay, and even to golden hellos in order to recruit staff in the needy areas of science and maths. But on the universal case, they are unmoved. They do not accept that if education were truly a national priority, then educators would be paid proper money. Nor is their view any different when it comes to the pay of other public servants whose work every politician insists we value, whether nurses or safety inspectors. </p> <p>Still, if there's one theme that comes through from the 200 interviews we have published with men and women who work for the common good, it is that pay is not the central factor in their lives. It is not what motivates them: instead, they gain satisfaction from feeling genuinely useful to the people whose lives they often transform. Nor is pay the subject of their most frequent complaint. That distinction belongs to another factor altogether: control. </p> <p>So many of the public servants we interviewed said it was power over their own circumstances that was missing and which they yearned for most. University professors who want to get on with teaching students, but who have to fill in box-files full of assessment forms instead; clinic managers who want to get on with treating the sick, but have to become masters of admin and bureaucracy - these are the complaints that come through loudest and clearest. You can pick your jargon word for what they seek - empowerment or autonomy - but what they really want is to be trusted to get on with the job they know best. </p> <p>Labour is wary of this kind of talk, too. Their approach has been to take control for themselves, keeping close tabs on the providers of public services. So it is David Blunkett's department of education which prescribes how schools should run - bombarding heads with directives and guidelines - while it is Gordon Brown's Treasury which wants final say on the London Underground, no matter what Londoners' elected mayor or his appointed transport chief say about it. Where there were once regional health authorities, there is now a centralised, National Plan. Where there were once local education authorities, there is now head teachers and the Treasury - with next to nothing in between. </p> <p>The origin of this centralising, control-freakish habit is not mysterious. Labour's high command remembers the bad old days, when public services were managed appallingly and when they failed to deliver the grand promises issued by Labour governments at the centre. That's why the government targets and monitors public work to within an inch of its life: nothing can be left to chance. </p> <p>A vicious cycle is at work here. Whitehall doesn't trust local government to deliver, therefore it takes more and more of its power away (witness the evisceration of the LEAs). Those weakened local authorities begin to shrivel, attracting fewer people of calibre and garnering less legitimacy. Their service becomes poorer and in turn they become less trusted by central government. Somehow a second term Labour government has to break this cycle. It needs to learn to let go, to trust those in the country to do the country's work. </p> <p>At present, the government says that it is only centralising now in order to decentralise later. But that recalls the US commander who spoke of bombing the Vietnamese village in order to save it: it makes no sense. No, now that Labour has the right template for local government it needs to give it a chance to work. Local authorities need to be able to run themselves; local services need to have the same opportunity. </p> <p>That will, and should, lead to an outbreak of diversity - as different groups in different places use different methods to meet different needs. After all those who believe in decent public services are not dogmatically committed to the means by which those services is delivered - just the principle that they should be. As Matthew Taylor and Gavin Kelly argue on these pages, the founding vision of the NHS was that it should be free, universal and comprehensive, not that it should be provided through a particular structure, process or set of employees. If people on the front line want to try a new way to meet an old need they should be free to do so. In some cases that might mean, as Taylor and Kelly suggest, new partnerships between the public sector and others - whether local, voluntary groups or private enterprise. Either way, the era of the one size fits all_all-encompassing, monolithic public provider is passing. </p> <p>Others including, Ed Mayo of the New Economics Foundation, seek to revive an idea deep in the left's heritage. They want the mutualisation of public services, transferring power over key functions away from the mandarins and ministers in Whitehall to stakeholders: the people who work in our services and use them. The goal, Mayo says, is to put the public back into public services. </p> <p>These are not wacky, fringe ideas. On the contrary, even veteran social democrats like David Marquand are speaking the same language. He agrees that there can be no return to the pre-Thatcher days when public services were seen to be run by a condescending and exclusive elite. Instead, the social democracy of the 21st century must recover the decentralist, participatory strands in its own tradition _Top-down, central-state social democracy is a busted flush. </p> <p>A kind of consensus is beginning to emerge. Yes, the sine qua non for the transformation of our public services is more money. They need that urgently and on a massive scale. They also need the kind of high-quality management which was long associated with the private sector and held to be alien to the public. These days people realise there is only good or bad management, in either sector, and our national services need the former. </p> <p>But there are deeper changes needed, beyond money and management. Our public servants want to be empowered, freed to make their own decisions within broad goals set by the wider society. As our interviews today show, there are huge energies pent-up inside the key services. Yet all too often they have been thwarted by bureaucracy and state nannying. Granted greater autonomy, they will be allowed to flourish. The result will be a diversity of provision suited to the more diverse nation we are becoming. But such a shift will also see our public services gaining what they failed to develop in those crucial years before Thatcherism: roots within civic society. As a local school, hospital or library becomes the emotional, if not literal, property of the people who use it then that institution will become rooted in its community, supported and protected by it. That surely is the future we all want for our public services. </p> <p>It comes down to a kind of bargain. We look to government to promise more money and more freedom. In return the public services themselves will be expected to manage themselves more efficiently, to deliver a better service and to nurture stronger roots in the communities they inhabit. </p> <p>A second-term Labour government can start by giving something which is not quantifiable: moral support. They can end the rhetoric of denigration that has been routine over the last two decades, and replace it with a determination to honour those who work in public service. They can show they understand the motives of our public servants, men and women like carer Brenda Harding who washes, dresses and provides meals to the elderly. I absolutely love the work, she says of her 12 clients. You feed them, but they feed you back. People like Ms Harding represent the best of Britain. For their lives are dedicated to all of us: they work for the common good. It's time we gave them the power to do their job.</p>",

I feel as if I am being asked to stick my finger in a dyke and wiggle it in the most imaginative way possible. I love my job - but the deck feels stacked against me.\" </p> <p>As head teacher of the Wavell School in Farnborough, Wheeler laments the energy and time he devotes to paperwork. Red tape, regulation, administration - these are the most pejorative terms in the 21st-century public sector. And worst of all is the B-word: bureaucracy. Britain's public servants feel as if they are drowning in a sea of directives, regulations, rules and guidance. Head teachers are leaving the profession in a top-level \"brain drain\", with additional administrative burdens cited as one of the key sources of discontent. </p> <p>The plight of the paper-logged principal has at least been spotted; the Government's Better Regulation Taskforce has highlighted the load faced by the women and men leading our schools - and Tony Blair has pledged to halve the flow of directives out of the Department for Education and Employment. </p> <p><strong> Setting standards</strong><br> </p> <p> Government initiatives, such as the National Curriculum and performance-related pay, are often blamed for the rise in bureaucracy but Wheeler says that most of the problems lie elsewhere. \"Yes, there are ways the Government could slim down the flow of initiatives. But by and large when bureaucracy is about setting standards, ensuring children's education it is impossible to oppose,\" he says. </p> <p>\"The real problem is this: I spend hours dealing with staffing problems caused by a shortage of suitably qualified teachers.\" </p> <p>Similarly, health care professionals expend a huge amount of time and effort organising cover for short-staffed wards and surgeries. Doctors spend hours chasing beds for patients. It is not the bureau cracy causing the problem - it is the problem, in this case inadequate resources, causing the bureaucracy. It is the symptom, not the disease. </p> <p>Nonetheless there has been a step-change in perceptions of bureaucracy - driven by two critical factors: first, the importing of a pro-business, market-know-best philosophy and second, the separation of bureaucracy from the values it is supposed to uphold, in particular accountability and responsibility. </p> <p>Large organisations - and in particular public sector agencies - are increasingly seen as sclerotic, encased in rules and incapable of radical action. Management guru Tom Peters sets the tone when he says: \"I beg each and every one of you to develop a passionate and public hatred of bureaucracy.\" </p> <p>But Stephen Martin, head of Reed Executive, says a more sophisticated view of bureaucracy is required in both the public and private sector. \"We need to distinguish between good bureaucracy - which establishes a clear system of checks and evaluations and bad bureaucracy, where the form-filling is more important than the doing, where every action has to generate a piece of relevant paper.\" </p> <p><strong> Choked on paper</strong><br> </p> <p> The paper trail that Martin identifies chokes initiatives such as the New Deal, where \"the emphasis is about getting pieces of information on pieces of paper\". The Employment Service produces 49 pieces of paper for each New Dealer, according the Wise Group, a Scottish training and work-placement agency. </p> <p>And while public-private partnerships (PPPs) are vaunted by the Government as a mechanism for bringing private sector \"efficiency\" into the state sector, in practice the influence has been at least as much in the opposite direction. Companies who are working with the public sector end up adopting similar procedures, according to Martin, whose company works with the New Deal and Employment Zones. Rather than PPP marketising the public sector, they are bureaucratising the private sector. </p> <p>At the same time, firms are complaining that the weight of administering the Working Families Tax Credit, minimum wage, stakeholder pensions, Working Time Directive and so on is becoming unbearable. The tendrils of the bureaucratic state are spreading, the business lobby complains. Farmers spend four hours a week filling forms rather than tilling fields. But in truth, the introduction of progressive workplace regulations is a cross that firms ought to bear if they want to trade in a civilised society. </p> <p>Bureaucracy, as Wheeler points out, \"is only ever what other people do.\" So the fact that middle managers in blue-chip companies spend hours, according to one survey, looking for a lost file, is not \"bureaucracy\" - but maternity leave extensions are. Hugely complex internal change management and evaluation systems are not bureaucracy - but the minimum wage is. </p> <p>In the public sector, the challenge is less to abolish or attack bureaucracy than to root out bad bureaucracy and strengthen good bureaucracy. Recent crises in the public sector, such as the North Wales care homes, Hackney Social Services, Railtrack and MAFF on the BSE epidemic have highlighted the lack of accountability in many areas of the public sector. </p> <p><strong> Reinvention required</strong><br> </p> <p> This is why Paul Du Gay, author of In Praise of Bureaucracy, argues for a reinvention of bureaucracy rather than its abandonment in favour of a free-wheeling entrepreneurial culture. Otherwise we risk losing \"fairness, probity and reliability in the treatment of cases and other forms of conduct that were taken somewhat for granted under traditional arrangements\". </p> <p>Effective bureaucracy provides systems for ensuring that the right person is held accountable for the right action. Bad bureaucracy, the kind which has flourished in recent years, dilutes accountability through the creation of lengthy paper trails: e-mail, of course, simply fuelling this cover-my-back tendency.

      "bodyText": "'My in-tray is ridiculous,' says Spokey Wheeler. \"I could spend all my time on it. I feel as if I am being asked to stick my finger in a dyke and wiggle it in the most imaginative way possible. I love my job - but the deck feels stacked against me.\" As head teacher of the Wavell School in Farnborough, Wheeler laments the energy and time he devotes to paperwork. Red tape, regulation, administration - these are the most pejorative terms in the 21st-century public sector. And worst of all is the B-word: bureaucracy. Britain's public servants feel as if they are drowning in a sea of directives, regulations, rules and guidance. Head teachers are leaving the profession in a top-level \"brain drain\", with additional administrative burdens cited as one of the key sources of discontent. The plight of the paper-logged principal has at least been spotted; the Government's Better Regulation Taskforce has highlighted the load faced by the women and men leading our schools - and Tony Blair has pledged to halve the flow of directives out of the Department for Education and Employment. Setting standards Government initiatives, such as the National Curriculum and performance-related pay, are often blamed for the rise in bureaucracy but Wheeler says that most of the problems lie elsewhere. \"Yes, there are ways the Government could slim down the flow of initiatives. But by and large when bureaucracy is about setting standards, ensuring children's education it is impossible to oppose,\" he says. \"The real problem is this: I spend hours dealing with staffing problems caused by a shortage of suitably qualified teachers.\" Similarly, health care professionals expend a huge amount of time and effort organising cover for short-staffed wards and surgeries. Doctors spend hours chasing beds for patients. It is not the bureau cracy causing the problem - it is the problem, in this case inadequate resources, causing the bureaucracy. It is the symptom, not the disease. Nonetheless there has been a step-change in perceptions of bureaucracy - driven by two critical factors: first, the importing of a pro-business, market-know-best philosophy and second, the separation of bureaucracy from the values it is supposed to uphold, in particular accountability and responsibility. Large organisations - and in particular public sector agencies - are increasingly seen as sclerotic, encased in rules and incapable of radical action. Management guru Tom Peters sets the tone when he says: \"I beg each and every one of you to develop a passionate and public hatred of bureaucracy.\" But Stephen Martin, head of Reed Executive, says a more sophisticated view of bureaucracy is required in both the public and private sector. \"We need to distinguish between good bureaucracy - which establishes a clear system of checks and evaluations and bad bureaucracy, where the form-filling is more important than the doing, where every action has to generate a piece of relevant paper.\" Choked on paper The paper trail that Martin identifies chokes initiatives such as the New Deal, where \"the emphasis is about getting pieces of information on pieces of paper\". The Employment Service produces 49 pieces of paper for each New Dealer, according the Wise Group, a Scottish training and work-placement agency. And while public-private partnerships (PPPs) are vaunted by the Government as a mechanism for bringing private sector \"efficiency\" into the state sector, in practice the influence has been at least as much in the opposite direction. Companies who are working with the public sector end up adopting similar procedures, according to Martin, whose company works with the New Deal and Employment Zones. Rather than PPP marketising the public sector, they are bureaucratising the private sector. At the same time, firms are complaining that the weight of administering the Working Families Tax Credit, minimum wage, stakeholder pensions, Working Time Directive and so on is becoming unbearable. The tendrils of the bureaucratic state are spreading, the business lobby complains. Farmers spend four hours a week filling forms rather than tilling fields. But in truth, the introduction of progressive workplace regulations is a cross that firms ought to bear if they want to trade in a civilised society. Bureaucracy, as Wheeler points out, \"is only ever what other people do.\" So the fact that middle managers in blue-chip companies spend hours, according to one survey, looking for a lost file, is not \"bureaucracy\" - but maternity leave extensions are. Hugely complex internal change management and evaluation systems are not bureaucracy - but the minimum wage is. In the public sector, the challenge is less to abolish or attack bureaucracy than to root out bad bureaucracy and strengthen good bureaucracy. Recent crises in the public sector, such as the North Wales care homes, Hackney Social Services, Railtrack and MAFF on the BSE epidemic have highlighted the lack of accountability in many areas of the public sector. Reinvention required This is why Paul Du Gay, author of In Praise of Bureaucracy, argues for a reinvention of bureaucracy rather than its abandonment in favour of a free-wheeling entrepreneurial culture. Otherwise we risk losing \"fairness, probity and reliability in the treatment of cases and other forms of conduct that were taken somewhat for granted under traditional arrangements\". Effective bureaucracy provides systems for ensuring that the right person is held accountable for the right action. Bad bureaucracy, the kind which has flourished in recent years, dilutes accountability through the creation of lengthy paper trails: e-mail, of course, simply fuelling this cover-my-back tendency. Bureaucracy has become a hiding place for poor management in public sector - the wall behind which some public servants can hide. This then is the paradox of bureaucracy in Britain's once proudly-bureaucratic public services: front-line staff are overwhelmed with the \"bureaucratic\" pressures caused by insufficient resources and poor management while Whitehall mandarins have become adept at using bureaucracy to defuse the very fibre of public service - accountability. Spokey Wheeler is not opposed to good bureaucracy. \"I am passionate about raising standards, and that means systems of evaluation and monitoring,\" he says. \"We all want to be stretched, to reach for that goal which is just beyond our fingertips. But right now, because of the time spent on administering to unnecessary issues, you have to be Magic Johnson to get anywhere close.

Housing. </p> <p>No matter that new money is available for employing more officers on the beat, teachers in the classroom or nurses on the ward, they cannot attract the people they need. Each is trying to deal with a crisis in recruitment to their branch of public services and the crux of the matter is the price of property. </p> <p>There are large parts of the south of England where people on the lower and middle rungs of public sector salaries can no longer afford to live. Experienced professionals from the north who might want to move jobs find themselves priced out of the market. </p> <p>As Whatford explains \"You have to be very rich, or in social housing or to have bought your house donkey's years ago\" to be able to live near her schools in Hammersmith and Fulham. \"It has got markedly worse in the last 18 months. I didn't know anything about housing till it became such a problem.\" </p> <p><strong> Loss of staff</strong><br> </p> <p> The experience is common to the Metropolitan police. \"We lose one in five officers because of the cost of housing,\" says Shurety. </p> <p>\"We traditionally rely on recruiting 50% of officers from outside a 70-mile radius of the capital, but they don't want to come. The further they get pushed out by prices, the harder it is to get them in for shifts.\" </p> <p>O'Dea's hospital, St Mary's Paddington, has a vacancy rate of 20% for nurses. In its report to the housing commission set up by the mayor of London to look into the scale of the problem, St Mary's said it had offered about 200 jobs to people who did not take them up because they could not afford to live within reach of the hospital. </p> <p>Chris Holmes, director of the housing group Shelter, chaired the commission and warns that if the problem is not tackled, maintaining the infrastructure in the south-east will be increasingly hard. </p> <p>\"People in the \u00a315,000-\u00a325,000 income range are being hit. It's not just nurses, teachers and police, it's also firefighters, social workers, civil servants. Evidence from a local education authorities' survey showed that a shortage of housing was the biggest single problem affecting recruitment and retention of staff.\" </p> <p>Since the 1980s London house prices have risen by 3.9% a year to an average of \u00a3180,000, but wages have grown by only 2.7%. Even in relatively deprived areas in the south, the price of houses has soared so that it now outstrips average salaries by a ratio of seven to one or more. </p> <p>In the US, they have already had to confront this 21st-century city affliction, the crisis of affluence, in the upmarket skiing resort of Aspen, Colorado, where prices rocketed as property was snapped up for holiday homes. Because no one else could afford to live there, the rich new part-time residents found themselves without the vital workers needed to make the town function. </p> <p>The infrastructure started to collapse. Where the market was failing to meet a clear need, the state had to step in. The city began to offer subsidised housing to any family of four earning less than about \u00a374,000 a year. Almost 50% of its permanent population qualifies for some subsidy and developers have been forced to set aside up to 70% of new homes for affordable accommodation. </p> <p>In New York, employers have had to take action. New York University has built 10,000 residential units for staff and students in the city in the last 10 years. </p> <p>Employers in London are also looking at ways of helping key workers. The Metropolitan police has negotiated free travel for some staff and can provide subsidised rental accommodation for new recruits. Many hospitals provide subsidised rooms for student nurses. </p> <p><strong> Home ownership</strong><br> </p> <p> But a return to the tied houses of previous centuries, where having somewhere to live depended on the patronage of the boss is not the answer. There is now recognition that any solution has to take workers' aspiration to home ownership into account. </p> <p>In Britain, the government has announced a Starter Homes Initiative under which 10,000 public sector workers will be eligible for grants averaging \u00a325,000 to help them get a foot on the property ladder in London. The scheme will cost \u00a3250m over three years, but the grants are available only on houses worth up to about \u00a3100,000, well below the price of an average family home in most areas. </p> <p>The Peabody Trust, a charity established by an American philanthropist in the 19th century, is working on a project with seven partners, including the NHS, local authorities, bus companies and the private sector, to develop a new model for providing housing for key workers. </p> <p>The scheme, called Keep London Working, will create 150 or so homes over the new few years for those employed in the public sector. Some will be rented at subsidised rates, and some will be available for shared equity purchase. </p> <p>With shared equity people can get a toehold in the property market and, if they want, trade up later, while the Trust keeps a proportion of the houses in perpetuity to offer to other key workers later. </p> <p>\"We're still trying to work out the details,\" says Peabody's director of development, Dickon Robinson, \"but what we really need to do is extend some of these principles to the commercial sector.\" </p> <p><strong> Affordable houses</strong><br> </p> <p> The full force of the crisis is yet to come. Many key workers entered the market years ago when it was still within reach. As they start to retire, affordable housing on the scale required will have to come from private developers. </p> <p>Local authorities can use their planning powers to make developers provide a percentage of cheap housing on new sites, but there is a huge variation between different areas. </p> <p>\"It is much better that affordable homes are provided within developments. It avoids the segregation between council and private housing that used to create ghettos,\" says Holmes. \"In Hammersmith and Fulham they have made it a priority and achieved 50% affordable housing on new developments, but over the river Wandsworth says it doesn't need any.\" </p> <p>Other councils have allowed developers to sell back their obligation to provide mixed housing and used the cash for other needs. </p> <p>The signs are that where councils take the lead, developers have woken up to the issues. St George, a major property developer, has a 10-year building programme at London's Imperial Wharf, which mixes social housing for rent, with some \"shared ownership\" property, student accommodation contracted to university organisations, homes for the elderly, and private flats selling at \u00a3300,000 and more. </p> <p>Charmaine Young, the company's director of regeneration, says this will be the pattern of the future. \"We're being brave in embracing a wider agenda. But gated developments a la Chelsea Wharf are not the way forward. There is an enormous shift in what you can negotiate now and we recognise that. The low waged but economically active are struggling so badly, it's having an impact on employers and services.\" </p> <p> <br><strong> Paying the price for a career in the classroom </strong><br> </p> <p> Toni Davis started as a new teacher at Kenmont Primary school in north west London last September and she loves her job. Her school is in a inner city area where teaching is tough, but she has a supportive head and she believes in what she is doing. The problem is money. She earns \u00a319,000, which gives her about \u00a31,100 a month to take home after tax. In the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham where she works the average price of a two-bedroom house is \u00a3230,000, so buying or renting near school are not possibilities. Instead she has gone out as far as Welyn Garden City to find affordable accommodation, and she and her partner pay \u00a3450 a month for a small one-bedroom flat. Like many new graduates, she has a student loan to pay off, which takes another \u00a3350 a month from her salary. Because she has to live so far away, travel also eats up a lot of her time and money. She spends \u00a3200 a month commuting by car (bought with a graduate loan). The train would take longer and be more expensive, and anyway isn't really practical because there are so many delays and she has to be certain of getting to school by 7am. She is left with only a couple of hundred pounds a month for all her other expenses. Her partner is an auditor earning \u00a318,000; the maximum mortgage they have been offered is \u00a3110,000. </p> <p>\"In the future I want a family and a house with a garden and if teaching stays the way it is, I'll have to think twice about carrying on, even though I love it. I look at my friends in the City and they haven't even been to university and they're earning double what I am.\" </p> <p>Her colleague Edward Bradley faces a similar dilemma. He wants to live in London but can only afford an 8ft by 8ft room in a shared ex-council house. \"I work hard and I'd love to buy my own house, but you have to move out of the profession if you want to do that. We're all committed and we're not just doing it for the money, but we want a future.\" </p> <p>For Kenmont head Melody Moran housing has become a preoccupation. Only half her staff were permanent when she took over two years ago, and recruitment and retention of teachers was a key issue in the school's Ofsted report. She has tackled the problem by bringing in young staff. \"When you are starting out the attractions of city life help compensate for grotty accommodation. \"But my next problem is, how am I going to get them to stay? </p> <p>\"After their first year or so people say, 'I don't want to live like this, I don't want to travel so far', and it's tough in inner cities. I haven't been able to get a supply temp since December. It is a terrible crisis.\"</p>",

St George, a major property developer, has a 10-year building programme at London's Imperial Wharf, which mixes social housing for rent, with some \"shared ownership\" property, student accommodation contracted to university organisations, homes for the elderly, and private flats selling at \u00a3300,000 and more. Charmaine Young, the company's director of regeneration, says this will be the pattern of the future. \"We're being brave in embracing a wider agenda. But gated developments a la Chelsea Wharf are not the way forward. There is an enormous shift in what you can negotiate now and we recognise that. The low waged but economically active are struggling so badly, it's having an impact on employers and services.\" Paying the price for a career in the classroom Toni Davis started as a new teacher at Kenmont Primary school in north west London last September and she loves her job. Her school is in a inner city area where teaching is tough, but she has a supportive head and she believes in what she is doing. The problem is money. She earns \u00a319,000, which gives her about \u00a31,100 a month to take home after tax. In the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham where she works the average price of a two-bedroom house is \u00a3230,000, so buying or renting near school are not possibilities. Instead she has gone out as far as Welyn Garden City to find affordable accommodation, and she and her partner pay \u00a3450 a month for a small one-bedroom flat. Like many new graduates, she has a student loan to pay off, which takes another \u00a3350 a month from her salary. Because she has to live so far away, travel also eats up a lot of her time and money. She spends \u00a3200 a month commuting by car (bought with a graduate loan). The train would take longer and be more expensive, and anyway isn't really practical because there are so many delays and she has to be certain of getting to school by 7am. She is left with only a couple of hundred pounds a month for all her other expenses. Her partner is an auditor earning \u00a318,000; the maximum mortgage they have been offered is \u00a3110,000. \"In the future I want a family and a house with a garden and if teaching stays the way it is, I'll have to think twice about carrying on, even though I love it. I look at my friends in the City and they haven't even been to university and they're earning double what I am.\" Her colleague Edward Bradley faces a similar dilemma. He wants to live in London but can only afford an 8ft by 8ft room in a shared ex-council house. \"I work hard and I'd love to buy my own house, but you have to move out of the profession if you want to do that. We're all committed and we're not just doing it for the money, but we want a future.\" For Kenmont head Melody Moran housing has become a preoccupation. Only half her staff were permanent when she took over two years ago, and recruitment and retention of teachers was a key issue in the school's Ofsted report. She has tackled the problem by bringing in young staff. \"When you are starting out the attractions of city life help compensate for grotty accommodation. \"But my next problem is, how am I going to get them to stay? \"After their first year or so people say, 'I don't want to live like this, I don't want to travel so far', and it's tough in inner cities. I haven't been able to get a supply temp since December. It is a terrible crisis.\"",

      "body": "<p>Melanie Zaalof was in a police station in central Birmingham when it hit her. \"I was doing a work placement there when a call came in to rescue a five-year-old girl who was at risk in a house nearby,\" the 18-year-old A-level student recalls. \"It took exactly two hours and fifteen minutes of filling out forms and filing papers before the officers could go and rescue that girl. And I just thought - that's not right. It can't be.\"</p> <p>But drowning in paperwork is only one of many reasons why Zaalof and her fellow students at Bournville secondary school in Birmingham baulk at the prospect of life in the public services. For Douglas Brown, the 17-year-old son of two teachers, it was the dawning realisation that working in the classroom was much like being a nightclub bouncer that did it. \"Three-quarters of the time it's just crowd control,\" he says. \"No wonder so many people get so disillusioned with it.\" At least nightclub bouncers get free drinks.</p> <p>There is nothing scientifically representative about Bournville, of course, but it is as good a snapshot of late-teenage Britain as any: an ethnically diverse urban comprehensive with a larger than average intake of below average pupils - popular with parents, rated good and improving when the Ofsted inspectors last called. </p> <p>Here, if anywhere, is where the next generation of doctors and nurses, teachers and police officers, civil servants and air traffic controllers must be found. But if they are thin on the ground - and they are - it is not for the reason that might be expected. Money, in fact, is almost never mentioned.</p> <p>It may be a timeless commonplace that each generation is more selfish than the last, bored by the pride in serving the community that supposedly quickened their parents' hearts - but it isn't true. When Bournville's 16- to 18-year-olds shun public-sector careers, they are not rebelling: they are following the advice of parents who took those jobs themselves and now dread their children doing the same.</p> <p>\"My dad is living proof for me, a living deterrent never to become a teacher,\" says one 16-year-old, an aspiring actor, echoing a widespread view. \"He thought he could do it for five years, then quit, but by then he'd got a mortgage. He comes home every day regretting his decision, and now he's stuck with it until he retires. He doesn't want me to get trapped like that.\"</p> <p>Hillcrest School, down the road from Bournville, has an arguably even more important role to play in the current recruitment crisis in the public services: it is an all-girls state school, and 80% of workers in the sector are women. There are some old-fashioned gripes among older students here - bureaucracy, lack of appreciation, too much routine - but one prevalent objection is of much more recent origin.</p> <p>\"You're constantly in the public eye and at risk of ending up in the papers - this doctor's done that, this teacher's done this, this nurse has done that,\" says Hayley-Jayne Kellerman, 16, who - despite everything, and seemingly uniquely - wants to teach maths (her academic father, needless to say, would rather she entered the world of finance). \"My stepmother's a pathologist, and after the organ scandals they came in, opened all the morgues, looked through all the files - it was just too much stress for her.

      "bodyText": "Melanie Zaalof was in a police station in central Birmingham when it hit her. \"I was doing a work placement there when a call came in to rescue a five-year-old girl who was at risk in a house nearby,\" the 18-year-old A-level student recalls. \"It took exactly two hours and fifteen minutes of filling out forms and filing papers before the officers could go and rescue that girl. And I just thought - that's not right. It can't be.\" But drowning in paperwork is only one of many reasons why Zaalof and her fellow students at Bournville secondary school in Birmingham baulk at the prospect of life in the public services. For Douglas Brown, the 17-year-old son of two teachers, it was the dawning realisation that working in the classroom was much like being a nightclub bouncer that did it. \"Three-quarters of the time it's just crowd control,\" he says. \"No wonder so many people get so disillusioned with it.\" At least nightclub bouncers get free drinks. There is nothing scientifically representative about Bournville, of course, but it is as good a snapshot of late-teenage Britain as any: an ethnically diverse urban comprehensive with a larger than average intake of below average pupils - popular with parents, rated good and improving when the Ofsted inspectors last called. Here, if anywhere, is where the next generation of doctors and nurses, teachers and police officers, civil servants and air traffic controllers must be found. But if they are thin on the ground - and they are - it is not for the reason that might be expected. Money, in fact, is almost never mentioned. It may be a timeless commonplace that each generation is more selfish than the last, bored by the pride in serving the community that supposedly quickened their parents' hearts - but it isn't true. When Bournville's 16- to 18-year-olds shun public-sector careers, they are not rebelling: they are following the advice of parents who took those jobs themselves and now dread their children doing the same. \"My dad is living proof for me, a living deterrent never to become a teacher,\" says one 16-year-old, an aspiring actor, echoing a widespread view. \"He thought he could do it for five years, then quit, but by then he'd got a mortgage. He comes home every day regretting his decision, and now he's stuck with it until he retires. He doesn't want me to get trapped like that.\" Hillcrest School, down the road from Bournville, has an arguably even more important role to play in the current recruitment crisis in the public services: it is an all-girls state school, and 80% of workers in the sector are women. There are some old-fashioned gripes among older students here - bureaucracy, lack of appreciation, too much routine - but one prevalent objection is of much more recent origin. \"You're constantly in the public eye and at risk of ending up in the papers - this doctor's done that, this teacher's done this, this nurse has done that,\" says Hayley-Jayne Kellerman, 16, who - despite everything, and seemingly uniquely - wants to teach maths (her academic father, needless to say, would rather she entered the world of finance). \"My stepmother's a pathologist, and after the organ scandals they came in, opened all the morgues, looked through all the files - it was just too much stress for her. The majority is judged by the minority.\" But even the traditional benefits of public sector work, such as relative job security, seem unattractive now. The anchorless insecurity of the new economy may have its losers - thousands of late-shift call-centre workers for every internet millionaire - but seeking the stability of a public service job seems like a kind of defeatism: an admission that one didn't even try to be a winner. \"Our generation is predicted to change career four times during our lives,\" says 18-year-old Seema Parmar. \"I don't want to look back on my life and see that I went into a job because it was safe and stayed there forever.\" \"You're going to spend most of your life doing it, so it might as well be meaningful,\" says Tom Willshire at Bournville. \"I'm told that the job I want will mean forget having girlfriends, forget having a regular place to live or anything like that, for years, but I'm happy to make that sacrifice.\" There are pockets of enthusiasm for public service, mostly among those who say they would be teachers or hospital staff for almost any money, because they can never remember having wanted to do anything else.

      "bodyText": "More evidence has emerged that the best value regime is too tough after one of the top council housing departments in the country failed to pass a test that would give it access to a \u00a3160m government fund aimed at rewarding excellence. A draft report by the housing inspectorate has given Kirkless council just two stars for its housing repairs - councils need three stars to access the fund - even though the council has been awarded beacon status by the government for its model repairs service. Kirklees gained beacon status by having some of the best tenant satisfaction levels in the country for its repairs service and some of the fastest repairs response times. The inspectorate's draft assessment has raised more doubts about the ability of any council to gain three stars. It comes after only two-star ratings were given to the highly regarded Harrogate council and Carrick council, which is also a beacon council on repairs. The inspectorate's excellence criteria has been criticised as being too exacting. It is understood Kirklees's chief housing officer Tony Hood has written to the inspectorate highlighting that many of the points raised in the draft inspection report had been met or were about to be met. Ann Raistrick, Liberal Democrat spokeswoman on housing at the council said: \"What do we have to do get three stars? If we can't get there, when we are considered a beacon authority, then what chance the others?\" But she added: \"Two stars is a good achievement, but it does not mean we are complacent. There is sense of slight disappointment, but we have got to be realistic, this was a snapshot survey.\" Chartered Institute of Housing policy director John Perry said: \"This is going to throw further doubt on the ability of other authorities to get three stars. The longer we have to wait for three stars to be awarded, and the more well thought of authorities fail to get three stars, the less likely it is that councils will gear up to the extra spending.\" The government fund has been set up as an incentive for councils to raise their performance. Many councils believe the fund is the first step towards the government eventually allowing top performing housing departments to borrow money for repairs from the money markets.",

I believe the time has come for the government to grasp the nettle and legislate to provide for all-women shortlists as part of the future selection procedure. The voluntary route has not delivered.</p> <p>Labour has 101 women MPs, but has only selected 126 candidates for the next election. That compares favourably with the other parties: the Lib Dems' women candidates account for 21% of their prospective candidates, the Tories just 14% and Labour 23%. Because of the 1997 landslide result, it is highly likely that women's representation will take a backwards step at the election.</p> <p>In Belgium and France they have compulsory quotas, while in Sweden and Germany many parties have voluntary quotas. In UK, an employment tribunal has ruled candidates should be treated as employees, so the Sex Discrimination Act applies, yet there is provision in the Human Rights Act for positive action to redress under-representation. <br> <b>Bill Morris </b> <br> General secretary, TGWU <br></p> <p>\u0095 It is a matter of debate how significant is the finding of Ermisch and Francesconi of a negative link between educational attainment and early maternal employment (Letters, March 16). I have found a similar association among other children, those born in 1970. But our report stressed that other predictive factors were at least as important, particularly family income, so children also stand to benefit from mothers' earning.</p> <p>In the 70s, it hardly occurred to the designers of surveys to ask about childcare or fathers' involvement in it, nor about the relationships of mothers with their children rather than the labour market. In our new survey of family life, the ESRC millennium cohort, we plan to cover all these topics and perhaps in 20 years' time, when these children's qualifications are assessed, the \"blame culture\", whether of mothers who stay at home or who do not, will be a thing of the past. <br><br><b>Prof Heather Joshi </b> <br> Institute of Education <br> <a href=\"mailto:hj@cls.ioe.ac.uk\">hj@cls.ioe.ac.uk</a><br></p> <p>\u0095 It's always a working mother that somehow blights her kids' future.

      "bodyText": "Polly Toynbee is right that Labour's women MPs have civilised parliament and influenced the government's \"family's first agenda\" (Better than men, March 16). The fact that we will have fewer women in the next parliament is a missed opportunity for my party and for the government. I believe the time has come for the government to grasp the nettle and legislate to provide for all-women shortlists as part of the future selection procedure. The voluntary route has not delivered. Labour has 101 women MPs, but has only selected 126 candidates for the next election. That compares favourably with the other parties: the Lib Dems' women candidates account for 21% of their prospective candidates, the Tories just 14% and Labour 23%. Because of the 1997 landslide result, it is highly likely that women's representation will take a backwards step at the election. In Belgium and France they have compulsory quotas, while in Sweden and Germany many parties have voluntary quotas. In UK, an employment tribunal has ruled candidates should be treated as employees, so the Sex Discrimination Act applies, yet there is provision in the Human Rights Act for positive action to redress under-representation. Bill Morris General secretary, TGWU \u0095 It is a matter of debate how significant is the finding of Ermisch and Francesconi of a negative link between educational attainment and early maternal employment (Letters, March 16). I have found a similar association among other children, those born in 1970. But our report stressed that other predictive factors were at least as important, particularly family income, so children also stand to benefit from mothers' earning. In the 70s, it hardly occurred to the designers of surveys to ask about childcare or fathers' involvement in it, nor about the relationships of mothers with their children rather than the labour market. In our new survey of family life, the ESRC millennium cohort, we plan to cover all these topics and perhaps in 20 years' time, when these children's qualifications are assessed, the \"blame culture\", whether of mothers who stay at home or who do not, will be a thing of the past. Prof Heather Joshi Institute of Education hj@cls.ioe.ac.uk \u0095 It's always a working mother that somehow blights her kids' future. These children grew up during 18 years of Tory government - with high inflation, negative equity, record unemployment. Wouldn't it be reasonable to say that the effects of the social conditions of the past two decades had a huge impact on family life and influenced growing children's view of the world? And who's to say that, without that part-time job to keep the wolf from the door, the family would not have been sucked into a hell of debt, divorce and despair? When is someone going to research the effects on children of having a go-to-work father? Cllr Angela Gunning Guildford, Surrey \u0095 The notion of sisterhood was not \"based on the assumption that all women would identify with one another to the exclusion of all men\" (Mary Kenny, G2, March 19).

      "bodyText": "Twenty children have been infected with hand, foot and mouth disease in Johor Baru province, south Malaysia, according to the regional media. The disease, quite unrelated to foot and mouth disease in animals, although also caused by a virus, broke out in Kulai, about 40 miles north of Singapore, during the Eid al-Fitr celebrations at the end of Ramadan, the Muslim fasting month. Wee Yoop Tawi, a local councillor, told the Malaysian newspaper the Star: \"Many children aged between one and five came down with fever and had blisters in their mouths and rashes on their hands and feet.\" since the outbreak occurred shortly after two children in Singapore died from the disease, dozens of parents rushed their children to hospital. Malaysia and Singapore had barely recovered from a much bigger outbreak in October, when more than 2,000 children were infected in Singapore and hundreds in Malaysia. More than a dozen children died in that outbreak, and schools, kindergartens, swimming pools and parks were closed for several weeks. Medical experts in Singapore and the US say there is no link between hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and the animal disease spreading in Britain. \"HFMD is a different disease than foot and mouth disease of cattle, sheep, and swine,\" the website of the National Centres for Infectious Diseases in Atlanta, Georgia, says. \"The two diseases are not related at all and are caused by different viruses\". The Singapore government and the Malaysian Medical Association say there is no known cure for HFMD, nor is it known why the disease is occasionally fatal although most bouts are mild, lasting only a few days.

      "bodyText": "The Commonwealth agreed yesterday to send a mission to President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe to express its concern about the recent attacks on the judiciary and the media. The British government hopes the ministerial delegation will press Mr Mugabe to curb further excesses. The Zimbabwe government reacted angrily to the decision yesterday. Its foreign minister, Stan Mudenge, said it was illegal and vowed not to cooperate with it. \"We will not participate in illegality,\" he said, adding: \"Instead of dispatching a ministerial group to Zimbabwe, it should send a mission to London to persuade Britain to honour its commitment to the land resettlement programme.\" If the mission reports that Mr Mugabe is seriously threatening democracy, the Commonwealth could suspend Zimbabwe's membership. But there were significant differences in tone in the statements yesterday of Commonwealth foreign ministers. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, was keen to promote the mission as a sign of the Commonwealth getting tough. \"We are not going there for a social call,\" he said, adding that the decision to send a ministerial delegation was the \"top of the ladder\" in terms of response. \"I stress that this was a unanimous agreement and therefore President Mugabe cannot now continue to pretend that it is only Britain who is criticising him.\" But the Botswanan foreign minister, Lieutenant-General Mompati Merahfe, adopted a softer approach, saying it was difficult to say for certain if Zimbabwe had overstepped the mark. The Commonwealth ministerial action group, which was established to try to maintain democratic principles, issued its statement after a two-day meeting in London. The tone of much of the statement was conciliatory. The ministers had decided that the mission should \"conduct consultations with the Zimbabwe government, convey its concerns and offer any appropriate Commonwealth assistance\". The mission will comprise the foreign ministers of Australia, Barbados and Nigeria. A spokesman for the Zimbabwean opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change, said in Harare that it was likely that a visit would be approved only if the delegation included countries considered friendly. Botswana and Nigeria would fit the bill. Under present Commonwealth rules, Zimbabwe cannot be suspended. But the rules, which basically provide for the suspension only of countries in which the democratically elected government is overthrown in a coup, are under review, and new criteria are likely to be recommended at the Commonwealth meeting in Brisbane in October. Relations between Britain and Zimbabwe have deteriorated sharply since the Foreign Office was highly critical of the illegal seizure of mainly white-owned farms. The Commonwealth action group also expressed concern that Pakistan's military rulers were stifling political opposition and warned them to hasten the restoration of democracy. Otherwise it would face \"stronger measures\", which would be taken if it did not make progress on a timetable for regional and nationals elections by October. Pakistan was suspended from Commonwealth ministerial meetings after the military coup in 1999.",

      "bodyText": "Roman Catholic priests and bishops in several parts of the world have been exploiting their religious authority to obtain sexual favours from nuns, in some cases resorting to rape and subsequently obliging the victims to seek an abortion, it was claimed yesterday. Report of widespread sexual abuses were compiled by two senior nuns between 1994 and 1998 and passed to the Vatican, the Rome daily La Repubblica and the Italian Roman Catholic news agency Adista said. Abuses were documented in 23 countries, many of them in Africa, but also in Ireland, Italy, the US, the Philippines and Brazil, they said. The Vatican acknowledged the existence of the problem yesterday and said it was working with bishops and the heads of religious orders to try to resolve it. \"The problem is known and is restricted to a limited geographic area,\" its spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said. \"A few negative situations must not make us forget the often heroic faithfulness of the vast majority of monks, nuns and priests.\" The Aids epidemic in Africa has led to nuns being seen as a potential source of safe sex, according to Sister Maura O'Donohue, of the Medical Missionaries of Mary, who visited numerous African countries to conduct an Aids study on behalf of the Catholic development agency Cafod. \"The superior of a religious community in one country was contacted by priests who asked her to make the nuns available for sexual services,\" she wrote. On the superior's refusal, the priests said they would otherwise have to go to the village to look for women, exposing themselves to the risk of Aids.\" The reports, one of which is said to have been delivered three years ago to Cardinal Eduardo Martinez Somalo, head of the Vatican department responsible for religious orders, say young female candidates for religious life are sometimes obliged to have sex with a priest to obtain the necessary certificates. Nuns who became pregnant were forced to leave their religious congregation, the reports say, while the priests responsible were simply sent away for a brief period. In one community 29 nuns are reported to have become pregnant after sexual relations with priests, but when the mother superior raised the problem with her archbishop she was removed from her post. One priest is said to have induced a nun he had impregnated to have an abortion and when she died during the operation he celebrated her funeral mass. Another priest is reported to have been driven from his village by gunfire when the local men got fed up with the way he abused his power with their women. Many African women have been raised to consider themselves inferior to men, and so find it difficult to say no to requests for sexual favours by priests, who are seen as authority figures, according to a report by Sister Marie McDonald, superior general of the Missionaries of Our Lady of Africa, quoted by Adista. The priests are better educated than the nuns and sometimes use false theological arguments to persuade them, suggesting, for example, that sex between two celibate religious does not violate their vows of celibacy, she said. Father Bernardo Cervellera, editor of the missionary news agency Fides, said the problem was largely confined to Africa, where the ideal of celibacy met resistance from cultural beliefs that set great store on fatherhood. \"In 25 years as a missionary priest I have never encountered this situation. I have come across the opposite, where priests have defended nuns from assault,\" he said. \"We shouldn't confuse a few individual errors with a tendency. I admire many African priests, who live their vocation with great heroism.\"",

Chime recorded organic operating profit growth of 18%. \"This is a good time to buy,\" Lord Bell said. \"Prices have topped out and people are being slightly less aggressive in their demands.\" Lord Bell said the group, which also owns the Bell Pottinger financial public relations business, had not experienced any downturn in the market. \"The advertising slowdown is in the US, not here, and we are primarily a UK business,\" he said. \"Where the UK has felt any effect it has been from the US-based multinationals but we are seeing no sign of a slowdown in the marketplace. There is nothing to cause concern.\" Chime recorded revenues during last year of \u00a3148m, an increase of 56%. Shares in the company climbed 6% to 184.5p. The group kicked off its buying spree in 2001 with an agreement to buy Boston-based hi-tech public relations agency LNS Communications in January. Lord Bell said the group aimed to build businesses in the US and Germany based on the model of the UK operation. Chime's share price has proved more robust than many of its peers, partly due to a re-rating after the HHCL acquisition and partly its elevation into the FTSE 250 which has attracted tracker funds.",

The water buffalo herd had been a much needed second enterprise, with the cows supplying milk for premium mozzarella cheese. The animals were imported from Romania in 1998, following strict quarantine procedures, and Richard and Dennis have worked hard to train them into some sort of domesticity and compliance. Water buffalo are hardy and do not suffer from common infections, but they are highly strung and temperamental. All gone to waste now. Their farm is about eight miles east of here and we now have another suspect case four miles to the west.</p> <p>We have had a hectic few days as the lambing season creeps closer, but at the end of last week I managed to leave the farm on urgent family business, which had already been delayed by three weeks. The drive across northern England and down the M6 was haunting. I chose a route, as far as was possible, to avoid confirmed cases, but in some areas this has become almost impossible. The sight of the smoke from so many funeral pyres throughout Cumbria was horrific.</p> <p>My worst moment so far came while I was away: Peter phoned me and said he was worried about some of our sheep. Two wouldn't get up and another wouldn't eat or walk. There were no signs of blisters. I suggested the thermometer, as a final check, and endured a dreadful two hours before he rang back. The three animals all had normal temperatures, so we decided not to hit the panic button. But the emotions we went through were awful.</p> <p>On my return to Northumberland, we went first to the Hexham car wash in an attempt to clear the outside of the car of any virus. Peter sprayed the wheels and wheel arches with disinfectant when we reached home and we all bathed and washed our hair, and every item of clothing, just in case. It all takes so long, and we don't really know if it will make any difference.</p> <p>We had more snow over the weekend and even more is forecast for this week. The sheep have had the hardest winter of their lives and their feed rations have been increased yet again; we have bought expensive glucose licks to give the pregnant ewes an instant energy boost. There is not a blade of grass to be seen anywhere, and this is not helping.</p> <p>Farmers in this area are beginning to suspect that they too will lose their sheep within a three kilometre radius. The cases continue to creep across the countryside in the Heddon-on-the-Wall area and parts of County Durham are becoming hot spots.</p> <p>Tow Law is the County Durham equivalent of Longtown. It is a long, grey town with the A68 running through the centre. There is little tourism, but it has an auction mart and lots of outlying farms. The climate is harsh and the people stoical, but as the disease tightens its grip the anxiety increases within the tightly knit community - the town is almost dead and there is no movement in the countryside. Since Friday the local valuer, Harry Vickers, has been living in the pub. He was classed as \"a dirty contact\" following a livestock valuation and unable to return to his farm and his sheep. But he is worried about his clients, some of whom are in a desperate state, both from an animal welfare and financial viewpoint.</p> <p>I have received a faxed list of countries with confirmed cases of foot and mouth, and the dates of each known outbreak.

      "body": "<p>The wind plays cruel tricks in Dumfries and Galloway. When it is still, the air smells of soil and silage, the ordinary, reassuring scents of agriculture. But when the wind blows it carries the sharp, disturbing whiff of smoke and disinfectant.</p> <p>Life and landscape have changed here. This is Scotland's agricultural heart and so far the only area of the country to be hit by the foot and mouth outbreak. There are now 54 confirmed cases and the region's rich pastureland is pockmarked with pyres and barriers and warning signs. Market towns are all but deserted and plastic tape crisscrosses farm tracks like so many crime scenes.</p> <p>At Kirkwood Farm near Lockerbie, Anthony Steel is waiting for the slaughtermen to come and kill his flock of 1,900 healthy sheep. Kirkwood lies within 3km of an infected farm and the grim work will start at the end of the week. Mr Steel is still trying to rationalise the need for his animals to be culled.</p> <p>\"Things have gone haywire,\" he said. \"I am really depressed. There is absolutely no doubt that it has spiralled out of control. If you talk to anyone now no one is saying it will be contained within a matter of weeks, most say it might be months, some say it might take years if it is controllable at all.</p> <p>\"I am being asked to make a sacrifice which I could understand if I had pure confidence it was going to work and work quickly but the more I see of it the more I fear it is a half-hearted gesture. There is too much indecision and there is distinct lack of confidence that they are going to get the disease finished. And my sheep will pay the ultimate sacrifice. It is just horrible.\"</p> <p>In Lockerbie itself the high street is too quiet for a midweek morning. The newsagent's window is filled with notices of cancelled social events: a coffee morning at Dryfesdale Church, an old time dance with Sandy Legget's band, a pensioners' lunch.</p> <p>At Fawcett's the butchers, Chilton Fawcett stands over half-empty display cases stocked with meat brought in from elsewhere. The family has had the business since 1938 and it survived the 1952 foot and mouth outbreak. Chilton Fawcett is not so sure about this one. Trade has already dropped by 60%.</p> <p>\"You can see yourself, there is no one around,\" he said. \"The town is empty and business is seriously affected.\"</p> <p>Andrew Campbell used to share that view. The convenor of Dumfries and Galloway council, and a farmer himself, he was sharply critical of politicians for their early response to the crisis. He thinks they have the message now.</p> <p>\"I said to them, you can push paper around in Edinburgh but if you don't come down and see for yourself and understand it you can't possibly lead in these matters. The whole economy of Dumfries and Galloway hangs from agriculture. It is 23% of our GDP and 43% of VAT registers.\"</p> <p>It has already been estimated that in the first week of the outbreak north of the border, 118 people lost their jobs in Dumfrires and Galloway. And a survey by the federation of small businessses has predicted that as many as 90% of the region's small firms could be lost if the crisis drags on.</p> <p>Back at Kirkwood Farm, Mr Steel say he does not know how much longer the community can live with the anxiety. \"There's a strange situation where those farmers who have had their flocks destroyed actually feel sorry for us who are still waiting for it to happen,\" he said. \"It's the worry that is the awful thing. You never see Tony Blair or the rest of the cabinet coming to help. Blair is ducking this altogether. Maybe he can't believe how bad it has become. Sometimes even I can't believe how bad it is.\"</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460128,00.html\">20.03.2001: Dutch investigate foot and mouth outbreak</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459666,00.html \">20.03.2001: Slaughter 'spreading disease'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459619,00.html \">20.03.2001: Chief vet's visit fails to pacify militants</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459526,00.html \">20.03.2001: Kangaroo leaps onto Europe's menus</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459650,00.html\">20.03.2001: Ads aim to bring back rural visitors</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459608,00.html\">20.03.2001: Farms' suppliers hit hard but expecting no payout</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459560,00.html\">20.03.2001: New foot and mouth threat to festival</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459686,00.html\">20.03.2001: Pile of carcasses is mere glimpse of complex task</a></p> <p><b>Interviews: voices from the front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459872,00.html \">20.03.2001: Nervously looking to Easter</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,457805,00.html\">16.03.2001: Waiting and watching and hoping</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,451194,00.html\">13.03.2001: 'The town is uncannily quiet</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">05.03.2001: Meet our panel: those affected by the crisis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/gallery/0,7366,451184,00.html\">Panel photo gallery</a><br></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html \">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681  \">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\">BSE</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>NetNotes</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs - the story in links</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459445,00.html\">Full text: vet's report on animal culls</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd\" target=\"_new\">Maff information and factsheets</a><br> <a href=\" http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/lif/dat/1985/en_385L0511.html\" target=\"_new\">EU legislation on the disease</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nfu.org.uk/info/f&amp;ml.asp\" target=\"_new\">National Farmers' Union</a><br><a href=\"http://www.mlc.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Meat and livestock commission</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.npa-uk.net\" target=\"_new\">National Pig Association</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.oie.int/eng/maladies/fiches/A_A010.HTM\" target=\"_new\">World organisation for animal health: foot and mouth disease</a><br><a href=\" http://www.equine-world.co.uk/equestrian_news\\footandmouth.htm\" target=\"_new&quot;\">Advice for horse owners - Equine World</a><br><a href=\" http://www.sheepdrove.com/fam.htm\" target=\"_new\">The case for vaccination</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The wind plays cruel tricks in Dumfries and Galloway. When it is still, the air smells of soil and silage, the ordinary, reassuring scents of agriculture. But when the wind blows it carries the sharp, disturbing whiff of smoke and disinfectant. Life and landscape have changed here. This is Scotland's agricultural heart and so far the only area of the country to be hit by the foot and mouth outbreak. There are now 54 confirmed cases and the region's rich pastureland is pockmarked with pyres and barriers and warning signs. Market towns are all but deserted and plastic tape crisscrosses farm tracks like so many crime scenes. At Kirkwood Farm near Lockerbie, Anthony Steel is waiting for the slaughtermen to come and kill his flock of 1,900 healthy sheep. Kirkwood lies within 3km of an infected farm and the grim work will start at the end of the week. Mr Steel is still trying to rationalise the need for his animals to be culled. \"Things have gone haywire,\" he said. \"I am really depressed. There is absolutely no doubt that it has spiralled out of control. If you talk to anyone now no one is saying it will be contained within a matter of weeks, most say it might be months, some say it might take years if it is controllable at all. \"I am being asked to make a sacrifice which I could understand if I had pure confidence it was going to work and work quickly but the more I see of it the more I fear it is a half-hearted gesture. There is too much indecision and there is distinct lack of confidence that they are going to get the disease finished. And my sheep will pay the ultimate sacrifice. It is just horrible.\" In Lockerbie itself the high street is too quiet for a midweek morning. The newsagent's window is filled with notices of cancelled social events: a coffee morning at Dryfesdale Church, an old time dance with Sandy Legget's band, a pensioners' lunch. At Fawcett's the butchers, Chilton Fawcett stands over half-empty display cases stocked with meat brought in from elsewhere. The family has had the business since 1938 and it survived the 1952 foot and mouth outbreak. Chilton Fawcett is not so sure about this one. Trade has already dropped by 60%. \"You can see yourself, there is no one around,\" he said. \"The town is empty and business is seriously affected.\" Andrew Campbell used to share that view. The convenor of Dumfries and Galloway council, and a farmer himself, he was sharply critical of politicians for their early response to the crisis. He thinks they have the message now. \"I said to them, you can push paper around in Edinburgh but if you don't come down and see for yourself and understand it you can't possibly lead in these matters. The whole economy of Dumfries and Galloway hangs from agriculture. It is 23% of our GDP and 43% of VAT registers.\" It has already been estimated that in the first week of the outbreak north of the border, 118 people lost their jobs in Dumfrires and Galloway. And a survey by the federation of small businessses has predicted that as many as 90% of the region's small firms could be lost if the crisis drags on. Back at Kirkwood Farm, Mr Steel say he does not know how much longer the community can live with the anxiety. \"There's a strange situation where those farmers who have had their flocks destroyed actually feel sorry for us who are still waiting for it to happen,\" he said. \"It's the worry that is the awful thing. You never see Tony Blair or the rest of the cabinet coming to help. Blair is ducking this altogether. Maybe he can't believe how bad it has become. Sometimes even I can't believe how bad it is.\" What's going on?

      "bodyText": "A judge yesterday named a woman who went missing after her former lover launched a legal fight to stop her from aborting their unborn child. Claire Hansell, 31, disappeared after her ex-boyfriend, Stephen Hone, took his case to the courts. Mr Hone launched his legal action against the Calthorpe nursing home in Edgbaston, Birmingham, saying the proposed termination contravened the Abortion Act. His lawyers argued it was unlawful because only one doctor was consulted, instead of two, and no questions were asked about Ms Hansell's physical and mental state and why she wanted a termination. His initial court application was adjourned after Mr Justice Sumner, a family division judge, said the Solihull clinic which sanctioned the abortion should be notified before any further hearing. His solicitor, Paul Conrathe, said the abortion was booked for today at another clinic in Edgbaston, Birmingham. Mr Conrathe said the action was being taken to prevent the clinic committing a criminal offence. But Mr Hone, 24, a sales consultant from Coventry, claimed a partial victory yesterday after the clinic agreed at the high court that it would not carry out the operation without further medical inquiries. Mr Justice Sumner, sitting in London, said the clinic had given a \"highly responsible and helpful\" undertaking that, if Ms Hansell continued to seek an abortion at the clinic, it would not rely on the certificate signed by the doctor originally seen by her. The clinic had also given a second undertaking that, in the event of an abortion eventually taking place after the correct procedures had been followed, they would not dispose of the foetus without first giving seven days' notice to Mr Hone. He has already made it clear he would seek access to the unborn baby's remains so that he could arrange a burial. Mr Hone said he was pleased with the agreement, but was\"saddened\" that the abortion could still go ahead. He said he was now \"desperate\" to find his former girlfriend in the hope of saving the unborn child. The agreement does not prevent Ms Hansell from seeking to terminate her pregnancy at another clinic, provided the correct legal procedures are followed. Mr Hone, who has a four-year-old son and a daughter of two from a previous relationship, has said he is against abortion and is prepared to take responsibility for the new baby and bring it up. He said last night: \"It is a victory in one sense but a loss in the sense that it has still not prevented the abortion of my child. Also, I would desperately like to hear from her just to know that she is all right.\"",

      "body": "<p>An outstanding offshore engineer, Tony Denton, who has died aged 63, had a part in some of the 20th century's most exciting and significant work in his field. He was on board the first drilling platform in the hostile conditions of the North Sea. On the Statfjord-B project, he was responsible for the lift of the 40,000-tonne integrated dock and the tow of an 825,000-tonne concrete platform.</p> <p>It was in 1963 that Denton met Captain David Noble, a master mariner and marine consultant, who asked him to look at the strength and stability problems of marine industrial equipment, such as oil and gas barges, floating docks, cranes and dredgers. It was the beginning of a fruitful partnership; Noble had vast sea-going experience, Denton had technical ability. Initially, he continued with his academic career at Imperial College, London, but, in 1966, he joined WD Noble &amp; Co on a fulltime basis. In 1971, the firm became Noble Denton &amp; Associates.</p> <p>The next 30 years were to see their growth into global operations, with particular emphasis on advising underwriters on the risks of locating and moving large structures at sea. Denton's design studies, assessments, and recommendations for drilling rigs and production platforms, and his experience of the towage of very large platforms, won him worldwide recognition.</p> <p>Engineering was in Denton's family blood - both his father and grandfather were senior colliery engineers. Born in Barnsley, and educated at Queen Elizabeth grammar school, Wakefield, where he was inspired by his mathematics teacher, he took the mechanical science tripos at Downing College, Cambridge, in 1958.</p> <p>He then accepted a graduate apprenticeship with Quasi-Arc, and published his first technical paper. In 1960, he moved to British Oxygen and was seconded to Imperial College, where his research into the weldless closing of tubes formed from strip lead led to a doctorate. He remained at the college, lecturing in mechanical engineering while his working relationship with Noble developed.</p> <p>He was managing director of Noble Denton International from 1977-86, and its chairman from 1981 until his retirement in 1997. From 1995 to 1999, Denton chaired the British national committee for the United Nations International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.</p> <p>He was vice-president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, chaired its international committee from 1992-95, and was president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1993. At the time of his death, he was president of the Institution of Incorporated Engineers. His honours included a CBE in 1997, a fellowship in engineering (1983) and an honorary doctorate from the City University.</p> <p>Hugely generous, private and modest, Denton had a competitive spirit - and a passion for cars.

      "bodyText": "An outstanding offshore engineer, Tony Denton, who has died aged 63, had a part in some of the 20th century's most exciting and significant work in his field. He was on board the first drilling platform in the hostile conditions of the North Sea. On the Statfjord-B project, he was responsible for the lift of the 40,000-tonne integrated dock and the tow of an 825,000-tonne concrete platform. It was in 1963 that Denton met Captain David Noble, a master mariner and marine consultant, who asked him to look at the strength and stability problems of marine industrial equipment, such as oil and gas barges, floating docks, cranes and dredgers. It was the beginning of a fruitful partnership; Noble had vast sea-going experience, Denton had technical ability. Initially, he continued with his academic career at Imperial College, London, but, in 1966, he joined WD Noble &amp; Co on a fulltime basis. In 1971, the firm became Noble Denton &amp; Associates. The next 30 years were to see their growth into global operations, with particular emphasis on advising underwriters on the risks of locating and moving large structures at sea. Denton's design studies, assessments, and recommendations for drilling rigs and production platforms, and his experience of the towage of very large platforms, won him worldwide recognition. Engineering was in Denton's family blood - both his father and grandfather were senior colliery engineers. Born in Barnsley, and educated at Queen Elizabeth grammar school, Wakefield, where he was inspired by his mathematics teacher, he took the mechanical science tripos at Downing College, Cambridge, in 1958. He then accepted a graduate apprenticeship with Quasi-Arc, and published his first technical paper. In 1960, he moved to British Oxygen and was seconded to Imperial College, where his research into the weldless closing of tubes formed from strip lead led to a doctorate. He remained at the college, lecturing in mechanical engineering while his working relationship with Noble developed. He was managing director of Noble Denton International from 1977-86, and its chairman from 1981 until his retirement in 1997. From 1995 to 1999, Denton chaired the British national committee for the United Nations International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction. He was vice-president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, chaired its international committee from 1992-95, and was president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1993. At the time of his death, he was president of the Institution of Incorporated Engineers. His honours included a CBE in 1997, a fellowship in engineering (1983) and an honorary doctorate from the City University. Hugely generous, private and modest, Denton had a competitive spirit - and a passion for cars. In his youth, he owned Mini-Coopers, Triumphs and Morgans, culminating in the Formula 3 Cooper with which Jackie Stewart had won the European championship - and which Denton raced until a serious crash. A lover of fine wines, he was also a keen rugby player, and never happier than when entertaining friends at Twickenham. Denton was married twice, first to Jean Moss, later Baroness Denton of Wakefield (Obituary, February 7 2001). He was especially proud of the work of his second wife, Anthea, whom he married in 1974, and whose sculpted bust of the engineer and businessman Sir William Barlow was presented to the Royal Academy of Engineering. She survives him. Anthony Albert Denton, eng-ineer, born March 14 1937; died March 3 2001",

      "body": "<p>When Katharine Dor\u00e9 was eight her parents took her to see her first Shakespeare play: Trevor Nunn's production of The Merchant of Venice. The deal was that, as long as she sat quietly, she would get an ice cream in the interval. The interval came and the ice cream was offered, but Dor\u00e9 refused to get up. It turned out she was so entranced by the play that she didn't want to leave her seat in case someone stole it. Dor\u00e9 hopes ice cream sales at the Albery Theatre will be plummeting this week with the opening of A Midsummer Night's Dream. </p> <p>This is her first venture as an independent West End producer after 13 years of guiding Adventures in Motion Pictures from fledgling dance company to international success. \"I want people to feel the same thrill I felt all those years ago. I want them to hang onto their seats,\" says Dor\u00e9, whose partnership with Matthew Bourne and AMP is on hold until the company takes up residence at the Old Vic in 2002. Bourne has been choreographing My Fair Lady at the National Theatre, while Dor\u00e9 has set up her own production company and is juggling several theatre and TV projects.</p> <p> But first off is A Midsummer Night's Dream. Several established West End producers have already suggested that Dor\u00e9 is completely mad, and she accepts that the received wisdom is that doing Shakespeare in the West End is tantamount to putting everything you own on a three-legged horse. But she has good reason to believe she can keep her shirt where others have lost theirs. For a start, there are few West End producers, however seasoned, with Dore's experience of the large scale. There is a world of difference between putting on a three-hander such as Art and AMP's Swan Lake, with its full corps de ballet and orchestra.</p> <p> The bottom line is that when Swan Lake was at the Dominion a couple of years ago it had to take \u00a3160,000 a week just to break even, so Dor\u00e9 reckons that the \u00a3120,000 a week needed for Dream to pay its way over an eight-week season is more than achievable. \"There are two ways to approach the West End. You can say, 'This is a great property and it will put bums on seats', or you can say, 'I really believe in this and I want to do it'. That's my way,\" says Dor\u00e9 of the latter, cheerily pointing out that the years with AMP have given her a good nose for what an audience wants. \"They want something superbly, beautifully produced, they want it to look great and they want to be entertained,\" she says. \"Stunning to the eye and stimulating to the heart and mind. Those qualities are the Katharine Dor\u00e9 brand . . . oops, I can't use that word.\" </p> <p>When, some years ago, Bourne proposed an all-male Swan Lake, Dor\u00e9 knew instantly it would work and wanted to be part of it. She had exactly the same feeling when director Matthew Francis and designer Lez Brotherston suggested that she stage a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, set in a large English country house during the second world war. The text is still all Shakespeare's, but Theseus and Hippolyta are part of an exiled court, Demetrius is in the army, Lysander is in the RAF, and Shakespeare's rude mechanicals are now members of the local Women's Institute, eager to put on a play to celebrate the royal wedding. Dor\u00e9's final trump card in terms of selling tickets is that Bottom is played by Dawn French. </p> <p>But Dor\u00e9 is at pains to point out that she is putting on real Shakespeare, \"not Vicar of Dibley Shakespeare\", and that this is a company show, not a star vehicle. After some initial confusion, when some of the team thought they were being offered parts in a ballet, Dor\u00e9 has assembled a strong cast, including Jemma Redgrave as Titania, Michael Silberry as Oberon and Tilly Blackwood as Helena. Dor\u00e9 is also firmly of the opinion that if you update or transpose classics, you have to have a strong rationale. \"There were a lot of doubters about Matthew's male swans in Swan Lake. But I could see the point of these masculine creatures, whose underlying violence and aggression comes through their lyrical movements. It was the same when Matthew and Lez put forward their idea for Dream. You can tell when a director is telling you about something from the heart and when they are just putting spin on a good idea.\" </p> <p>A few years ago Dor\u00e9 and AMP took Swan Lake to Broadway. The show was a triumph, winning the company 15 awards, but the experience reminded her that, although we may grumble about our West End theatre, we have a lot to be grateful for. \"I thought that taking a show to Broadway would be the ultimate, but it turned out to be the most desolate place on earth to work. There is no creativity and no community there. The only thing that counts is the bottom line. Thank goodness it is not like that here, that producers and audiences will still take risks. I really do believe that if the work is good enough, you'll get an audience for it.\" </p> <p> \u0095 A Midsummer Night's Dream is at the Albery Theatre, London WC2 (020-7369 1740), from Friday until May 12.</p>",

Several established West End producers have already suggested that Dor\u00e9 is completely mad, and she accepts that the received wisdom is that doing Shakespeare in the West End is tantamount to putting everything you own on a three-legged horse. But she has good reason to believe she can keep her shirt where others have lost theirs. For a start, there are few West End producers, however seasoned, with Dore's experience of the large scale. There is a world of difference between putting on a three-hander such as Art and AMP's Swan Lake, with its full corps de ballet and orchestra. The bottom line is that when Swan Lake was at the Dominion a couple of years ago it had to take \u00a3160,000 a week just to break even, so Dor\u00e9 reckons that the \u00a3120,000 a week needed for Dream to pay its way over an eight-week season is more than achievable. \"There are two ways to approach the West End. You can say, 'This is a great property and it will put bums on seats', or you can say, 'I really believe in this and I want to do it'. That's my way,\" says Dor\u00e9 of the latter, cheerily pointing out that the years with AMP have given her a good nose for what an audience wants. \"They want something superbly, beautifully produced, they want it to look great and they want to be entertained,\" she says. \"Stunning to the eye and stimulating to the heart and mind. Those qualities are the Katharine Dor\u00e9 brand . . . oops, I can't use that word.\" When, some years ago, Bourne proposed an all-male Swan Lake, Dor\u00e9 knew instantly it would work and wanted to be part of it. She had exactly the same feeling when director Matthew Francis and designer Lez Brotherston suggested that she stage a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, set in a large English country house during the second world war. The text is still all Shakespeare's, but Theseus and Hippolyta are part of an exiled court, Demetrius is in the army, Lysander is in the RAF, and Shakespeare's rude mechanicals are now members of the local Women's Institute, eager to put on a play to celebrate the royal wedding. Dor\u00e9's final trump card in terms of selling tickets is that Bottom is played by Dawn French. But Dor\u00e9 is at pains to point out that she is putting on real Shakespeare, \"not Vicar of Dibley Shakespeare\", and that this is a company show, not a star vehicle. After some initial confusion, when some of the team thought they were being offered parts in a ballet, Dor\u00e9 has assembled a strong cast, including Jemma Redgrave as Titania, Michael Silberry as Oberon and Tilly Blackwood as Helena. Dor\u00e9 is also firmly of the opinion that if you update or transpose classics, you have to have a strong rationale. \"There were a lot of doubters about Matthew's male swans in Swan Lake. But I could see the point of these masculine creatures, whose underlying violence and aggression comes through their lyrical movements. It was the same when Matthew and Lez put forward their idea for Dream. You can tell when a director is telling you about something from the heart and when they are just putting spin on a good idea.\" A few years ago Dor\u00e9 and AMP took Swan Lake to Broadway. The show was a triumph, winning the company 15 awards, but the experience reminded her that, although we may grumble about our West End theatre, we have a lot to be grateful for. \"I thought that taking a show to Broadway would be the ultimate, but it turned out to be the most desolate place on earth to work. There is no creativity and no community there. The only thing that counts is the bottom line. Thank goodness it is not like that here, that producers and audiences will still take risks. I really do believe that if the work is good enough, you'll get an audience for it.\" \u0095 A Midsummer Night's Dream is at the Albery Theatre, London WC2 (020-7369 1740), from Friday until May 12.",

      "body": "<p>It's a wintry Tuesday night in darkest north London, and the sound of singing is spilling out from a church. A Belgian choreographer and a British composer creep in. At the altar, amid a cluster of unused amps, a huddle of young men and women are filling the space with one of the most uplifting vocal symphonies their visiting audience has heard. This is the Congolese Christian Choir. They sing in French, or in the Kikongo dialect; not all of them speak English. The excited man in charge wants to show the choreographer, Alain Platel, and the composer, Orlando Gough, what his group can do. After half an hour of soaring African spirituals, the guests are reluctant to leave. \"I could stay for ever,\" says Platel, dewy-eyed. \"I found that very, very moving,\" says Gough. </p> <p>The reason for their visit is a project called Because I Sing, directed by the pair and produced by Artangel. Fascinated by communal singing - from football matches to the last night of the Proms - Artangel chief Michael Morris and Platel, acclaimed choreographer of Les Ballets C de la B, came up with the idea of uniting amateur choirs from across London in a one-off \"choral portrait\" of the city. The event - which takes place later this month at Camden's Roundhouse, and is being filmed for Channel 4 - has involved a year's work. \"I've lived in London all my life, and I've discovered parts I never knew existed,\" says Morris.</p> <p> According to Gough, who runs the professional choral ensemble The Shout, the only directory of London choirs is written by and for a middle-aged white constituency. By \"putting the word out and following our noses\", the team excavated an astonishingly diverse subculture. The final bill of participants - which includes the Armenian church, the Gwalia Welsh choir and the Ngati Ranana Maori choir - represents their richest pickings. \"At first,\" recalls Gough, \"we got distracted by the idea of full ethnic coverage - it was becoming a PC exercise in getting one of everything, which was ridiculous because they just don't exist.\" There is, for example, no Asian choral tradition. So Gough and Platel broadened the terms of their search. In the final production, a choir from Lloyds Bank will sing with the South Hampstead School for Girls, and the London Gay Men's Chorus with the Kingdom Gospel choir of Tooting. Time constraints scuppered the Metropolitan police's plans to participate; their rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody had much impressed Gough and Platel. </p> <p>The latter is a small-town boy - he was an academic in Ghent before shooting to unlikely stardom in the early 1990s - and is bamboozled by London's vastness. \"This is hell,\" he remarks, emerging from Shepherd's Bush tube station. The choirs that comprise Because I Sing are the flipside: London's heaven, representing both the city's multiculturalism and the desire of communities to retain their identities within it. Platel is fascinated too by the nooks and draughty cellars the choirs have found to rehearse in. It's essential to him that Because I Sing \"retains an element of the spaces in which the choirs perform. I'm worried that, by taking them to the Roundhouse, we might harm them.\" Gough agrees: \"It's up to us to try and preserve the magic.\" </p> <p> In Shepherd's Bush, Platel and Gough visited St Saviour's Church, for the London Diocese Deaf Choir's Christmas service. The appeal of the deaf choir couldn't be more different from that of their Congolese counterparts: they sing, not vocally, but with their hands, in synchronised swoops and flutters of sign language. Choir leader Dorothy had her work cut out keeping singers and organist, who's high-tone deaf, in time. There were disagreements over how each carol should be signed - partly because the British Sign Language word for \"Christmas\" doesn't incorporate the word for \"Christ\".</p> <p> And yet the performance was extremely expressive - like a dance, in miniature. Gough left St Saviour's delighted by what he had seen, and \"terribly excited about the event\" - even though neither he nor Platel have a keen idea what form it will take or who'll sing what. The 16 groups come together only three days before their performance - an occasion on which, says Gough, \"I think the shit is going to seriously hit the fan.\"</p> <p>Very few of the choirs have experience of singing in any group larger than their own. \"Trying to get 500 people or ganised and galvanised is going to be very hard. The choirs are very anxious about the practicalities,\" he explains. In the face of such anxieties, Gough has abandoned his plan of having the scenery changes powered by horses - as a tribute to the Roundhouse's railway origins. Jeremy Haneman, of the London Gay Men's Chorus, agrees that the project is bewilderingly ambitious. \"If a lesser organisation than Artangel had come up with it, we would have said, 'Dream on.' Even now, it's a bit of a mystery what's going to happen. That's part of the attraction.\"</p> <p> Gough is expecting something \"like a political summit, with that chaos and that many misunderstandings. But I don't want it to be precious and beautiful. A lot of the amateur choirs are at their best when they're at their rawest.\" It's not until a few months after seeing the Congolese and deaf choirs that Gough formulates a clearer picture of the final production. After delicate negotiation, songs have been selected for each choir to perform, and a structure for the event - \"from rarefied and exotic\", says Gough, \"to familiar and poppy\" - settled upon. </p> <p>he Armenian group is to kick off the show, the Gay Men's Chorus will croon Kylie Minogue, and the finale will involve \"all the choirs singing a different popular song simultaneously. We have three enormous banks of steps forming a great Busby Berkeley staircase at the end. We want to get all the choirs singing but not in a kind of cheesy Hollywood romp. So we're going for this stranger idea - which might be really beautiful, might be chaotic and might be quite funny.\" While the production \"could easily spiral out of control\", says Gough, he and Platel hope it will remind audiences of music's messy, informal grassroots \"There isn't a culture of respect for amateurism any more,\" Gough adds. \"It's so easy to see and buy highly professional music these days that people always expect perfection. Whereas part of what's special about these groups is that they're not perfect.\" Haneman, of the London Gay Men's Chorus, points out that - as the event's title obliquely indicates - singing isn't a means to an end, but the end itself. \"There's no logical reason to do it. It's not particularly good for your health. But there is nothing like it.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Because I Sing is at the Roundhouse, London NW1 (020-7771 2000), on March 31 and April 1.</p>",

      "body": "<p>At 3.30 yesterday morning, the lights were still blazing at the offices of law firm Slaughter &amp; May, just off Moorgate in the City. The chief executive of Whitbread, David Thomas, was signing a \u00a31.625bn deal to sell the company's chain of 2,998 pubs to the venture capital firm, Morgan Grenfell Private Equity. </p> <p>\"It turned into a bit of an endurance contest,\" he said. \"There seems to be a rule against signing any deal in the City outside the hours of midnight to 7am.\" </p> <p>The long-awaited transaction is the latest in a series of sales to put thousands of Britain's pubs in the hands of foreign banks. Morgan Grenfell, which is owned by Deutsche Bank, joins the Japanese finance house Nomura among the country's top four landlords. </p> <p>It marked the apparent end of a five-month tussle between several of Britain's leading leisure entrepreneurs - including a public row between former PizzaExpress colleagues Luke Johnson and Hugh Osmond. </p> <p>The saga began in October, when Whitbread announced that, having sold its brewing division, it no longer wanted its pubs and bars, which include the nationwide chains Hogshead and Dme. </p> <p>Mr Thomas said: \"We have to provide what our shareholders want - returns and growth. Things like off-licences, brewing and pubs weren't capable of providing improving returns.\" </p> <p>About 25 buyers expressed interest, including the established pub chains such as Enterprise Inns. By the final stages, however, four bidders were left in the ring - Morgan Grenfell, Punch Taverns, Pubmaster and Nomura. </p> <p>A sudden spat broke out last month, when Punch Taverns' chairman, Hugh Osmond, discovered that Morgan Grenfell had recruited Belgo restaurant supremo Luke Johnson as a potential boss of the pub chain. </p> <p>Mr Osmond had previously been a close associate of Mr Johnson - the pair turned PizzaExpress into one of the success stories of the 1990s. </p> <p>Mr Osmond was furious to find himself pitted against his old colleague - he cited a \"no competition\" clause signed by Johnson as a shareholder in Punch two years ago.

      "bodyText": "At 3.30 yesterday morning, the lights were still blazing at the offices of law firm Slaughter &amp; May, just off Moorgate in the City. The chief executive of Whitbread, David Thomas, was signing a \u00a31.625bn deal to sell the company's chain of 2,998 pubs to the venture capital firm, Morgan Grenfell Private Equity. \"It turned into a bit of an endurance contest,\" he said. \"There seems to be a rule against signing any deal in the City outside the hours of midnight to 7am.\" The long-awaited transaction is the latest in a series of sales to put thousands of Britain's pubs in the hands of foreign banks. Morgan Grenfell, which is owned by Deutsche Bank, joins the Japanese finance house Nomura among the country's top four landlords. It marked the apparent end of a five-month tussle between several of Britain's leading leisure entrepreneurs - including a public row between former PizzaExpress colleagues Luke Johnson and Hugh Osmond. The saga began in October, when Whitbread announced that, having sold its brewing division, it no longer wanted its pubs and bars, which include the nationwide chains Hogshead and Dme. Mr Thomas said: \"We have to provide what our shareholders want - returns and growth. Things like off-licences, brewing and pubs weren't capable of providing improving returns.\" About 25 buyers expressed interest, including the established pub chains such as Enterprise Inns. By the final stages, however, four bidders were left in the ring - Morgan Grenfell, Punch Taverns, Pubmaster and Nomura. A sudden spat broke out last month, when Punch Taverns' chairman, Hugh Osmond, discovered that Morgan Grenfell had recruited Belgo restaurant supremo Luke Johnson as a potential boss of the pub chain. Mr Osmond had previously been a close associate of Mr Johnson - the pair turned PizzaExpress into one of the success stories of the 1990s. Mr Osmond was furious to find himself pitted against his old colleague - he cited a \"no competition\" clause signed by Johnson as a shareholder in Punch two years ago. Lawyers' letters were exchanged and the outcome was that a mightily peeved Mr Johnson had to withdraw from Morgan Grenfell's bid. Mr Osmond admitted: \"I don't imagine I'll be top of his Christmas card list any more.\" Meanwhile, a parallel controversy developed as a cluster of disgruntled landlords demanded the right to buy their own pubs. Whitbread refused, maintaining that such a process would be expensive and time-consuming, but the tenants persisted, with support from former chairman Sir Charles Tidbury, a distinguished brewery chief who once survived an IRA assassination attempt. That debate culminated in an angry confrontation at an extraordinary general meeting of Whitbread in January, at which tenants claimed they had been treated like \"lepers\" and Sir Charles bemoaned the board's lack of moral fibre Mr Thomas was unrepentant yesterday: \"Sir Charles is a colourful character with strong views. I admire his determination, but I totally disagree with him on this occasion.\" As Morgan Grenfell edged ahead of the pack, becoming the only bidder to offer more than \u00a31.6bn, there was a final twist. Mr Osmond pulled a second \"no-competition\" clause from his sleeve, this time signed by Bankers Trust Capital, which sits alongside Morgan Grenfell in the Deutsche Bank group. Mr Osmond was scathing about the amount the German bank was willing to pay for Whitbread's pubs: \"They're paying more than Whitbread ever expected. \"I don't think they're working on the right run rate - they've never run pubs before and they've got to take into account the cost of things like the minimum wage and Sky television.\" He threatened to block the deal, claiming that Deutsche has inside knowledge of Punch which could give the German bank an unfair advantage in high street competition: \"They know a great deal about Punch Taverns.

Morgan Grenfell, al though unwilling to discuss the transaction yesterday, is adamant that its legal position is sound. Although it has no experience in running pubs, the venture capital firm has sealed a number of other high-profile purchases, including that of the Italian scooter firm Piaggio and a deal to acquire 12.5% of Bernie Ecclestone's formula one motor racing operation.

      "body": "<p>Barclays Bank yesterday extended its loan break to farmers affected by the foot and mouth outbreak to all businesses - ranging from chip shops to hotels - in the worst-hit areas of the country. </p> <p>One in four of its farming customers in communities hurt by the rapidly spreading disease have already taken up its three-month break from loan payments since it was introduced on March 3. </p> <p>With the deepening of the crisis, the bank said its managers would be contacting other businesses which faced financial difficulties. </p> <p>\"As the outbreak continues, it is becoming clear that many other businesses - particularly those operating in the tourist sector - are also being hit hard,\" said Alastair Camp, a Barclays director. </p> <p>The bank said it was impossible to indicate how many businesses might now be in need of financial help or what the impact could be on its overall profitability. </p> <p>Barclays' attempt to show a sympathetic face to troubled rural communities comes after Royal Bank of Scotland donated \u00a31m to charities helping farmers. Royal Bank was also at pains yesterday to demon strate that it would not take a tough stance on farmers who were already operating in a bleak economic environment before this latest crisis broke. </p> <p>The announcements from the banks come as fallout from the epidemic continues to spread into the wider economy, with profit warnings yesterday from Express Dairies and pylon repair company Peterhouse Group, along with a price rise on some of Unilever's meat snack products. </p> <p>While dairy herds have so far remained largely unaffected by the outbreak, Express Dairies still issued a trading statement in which it said that continuing uncertainty over the rural economy could add to the company's woes. </p> <p>Peterhouse, the engineering company, warned that work on pylons had been affected in restricted areas in the south-west and Cumbria. </p> <p>\"The outbreak is bound to have a short-term effect on the group's performance in 2001,\" it said in a statement. It added that a sharp upturn in business was anticipated as soon as access to agricultural land was once again permitted. The effects of the outbreak were also being felt by companies throughout the rest of Europe yesterday, with Unilever's IgloMora brand - Belgium and the Netherlands' equivalent of Birds Eye - claiming that foot and mouth disease had in part forced it to increase the price of its meat snack products. </p> <p>The company said it was passing on some of a 35%-40% increase in poultry prices, and a rise of up to 70% on pork. </p> <p>Blaming BSE and foot and mouth disease for the rising cost, Unilever insisted there were no plans to introduce similar price rises on its Birds Eye range. \"We are swallowing the rising costs ourselves,\" a spokesman said. </p> <p>In Germany, the farm machinery manufacturers' association, AGL, has warned that its members' sales could fall as anxious farmers in Britain and throughout Europe put off new investments. </p> <p>\"Farmers are uncertain - they don't know how their markets will develop, what politics will do, and some of them suffered outright losses because of the mad cow crisis,\" an AGL spokesman told Reuters. He said spring was usually high season for buying such equipment but this year purchases were being pushed back. </p> <p><strong>What's going on?</strong><br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\"&gt;Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures<br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\"&gt;Causes and effects</p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br> &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460128,00.html\"&gt;20.03.2001: Dutch investigate foot and mouth outbreak<br>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459666,00.html \"&gt;20.03.2001: Slaughter 'spreading disease'<br> &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459619,00.html \"&gt;20.03.2001: Chief vet's visit fails to pacify militants<br> &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459526,00.html \"&gt;20.03.2001: Kangaroo leaps onto Europe's menus<br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459650,00.html\"&gt;20.03.2001: Ads aim to bring back rural visitors<br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459608,00.html\"&gt;20.03.2001: Farms' suppliers hit hard but expecting no payout<br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459560,00.html\"&gt;20.03.2001: New foot and mouth threat to festival<br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459686,00.html\"&gt;20.03.2001: Pile of carcasses is mere glimpse of complex task</p> <p><strong>Interviews: voices from the front line</strong><br>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459872,00.html \"&gt;20.03.2001: Nervously looking to Easter<br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,457805,00.html\"&gt;16.03.2001: Waiting and watching and hoping<br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,451194,00.html\"&gt;13.03.2001: 'The town is uncannily quiet<br>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\"&gt;05.03.2001: Meet our panel: those affected by the crisis<br>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/gallery/0,7366,451184,00.html\"&gt;Panel photo gallery<br></p> <p><strong>Interactive guides</strong><br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\"&gt;How the virus spread across Britain<br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\"&gt;The countryside in crisis</p> <p><strong>Graphics</strong><br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\"&gt;Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)<br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\"&gt;Map of confirmed cases so far<br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html \"&gt;Computerised image of the virus<br></p> <p><strong>Photo gallery</strong><br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\"&gt;The story in pictures</p> <p><strong>Talk about it</strong><br>&lt;A HREF=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681 \"&gt;What do you think?</p> <p><strong>Special reports</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\"&gt;BSE<br>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\"&gt;Countryside in crisis</p> <p><strong>NetNotes</strong><br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\"&gt;Pigs - the story in links</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk\" TARGET=\"_new\"&gt;Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food<br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459445,00.html\"&gt;Full text: vet's report on animal culls<br> &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd\" TARGET=\"_new\"&gt;Maff information and factsheets<br> &lt;A HREF=\" http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/lif/dat/1985/en_385L0511.html\" TARGET=\"_new\"&gt;EU legislation on the disease<br>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.nfu.org.uk/info/f&amp;ml.asp\" TARGET=\"_new\"&gt;National Farmers' Union<br><a href=\"http://www.mlc.org.uk\">Meat and livestock commission</a><br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.npa-uk.net\" TARGET=\"_new\"&gt;National Pig Association<br> &lt;A HREF=\" http://www.oie.int/eng/maladies/fiches/A_A010.HTM\" TARGET=\"_new\"&gt;World organisation for animal health: foot and mouth disease<br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.equine-world.co.uk/equestrian_news\\footandmouth.htm\" TARGET=_new\"&gt;Advice for horse owners - Equine World<br>&lt;A HREF=\" http://www.sheepdrove.com/fam.htm\" TARGET=\"_new\"&gt;The case for vaccination</p>",

      "bodyText": "Barclays Bank yesterday extended its loan break to farmers affected by the foot and mouth outbreak to all businesses - ranging from chip shops to hotels - in the worst-hit areas of the country. One in four of its farming customers in communities hurt by the rapidly spreading disease have already taken up its three-month break from loan payments since it was introduced on March 3. With the deepening of the crisis, the bank said its managers would be contacting other businesses which faced financial difficulties. \"As the outbreak continues, it is becoming clear that many other businesses - particularly those operating in the tourist sector - are also being hit hard,\" said Alastair Camp, a Barclays director. The bank said it was impossible to indicate how many businesses might now be in need of financial help or what the impact could be on its overall profitability. Barclays' attempt to show a sympathetic face to troubled rural communities comes after Royal Bank of Scotland donated \u00a31m to charities helping farmers. Royal Bank was also at pains yesterday to demon strate that it would not take a tough stance on farmers who were already operating in a bleak economic environment before this latest crisis broke. The announcements from the banks come as fallout from the epidemic continues to spread into the wider economy, with profit warnings yesterday from Express Dairies and pylon repair company Peterhouse Group, along with a price rise on some of Unilever's meat snack products. While dairy herds have so far remained largely unaffected by the outbreak, Express Dairies still issued a trading statement in which it said that continuing uncertainty over the rural economy could add to the company's woes. Peterhouse, the engineering company, warned that work on pylons had been affected in restricted areas in the south-west and Cumbria. \"The outbreak is bound to have a short-term effect on the group's performance in 2001,\" it said in a statement. It added that a sharp upturn in business was anticipated as soon as access to agricultural land was once again permitted. The effects of the outbreak were also being felt by companies throughout the rest of Europe yesterday, with Unilever's IgloMora brand - Belgium and the Netherlands' equivalent of Birds Eye - claiming that foot and mouth disease had in part forced it to increase the price of its meat snack products. The company said it was passing on some of a 35%-40% increase in poultry prices, and a rise of up to 70% on pork. Blaming BSE and foot and mouth disease for the rising cost, Unilever insisted there were no plans to introduce similar price rises on its Birds Eye range. \"We are swallowing the rising costs ourselves,\" a spokesman said. In Germany, the farm machinery manufacturers' association, AGL, has warned that its members' sales could fall as anxious farmers in Britain and throughout Europe put off new investments. \"Farmers are uncertain - they don't know how their markets will develop, what politics will do, and some of them suffered outright losses because of the mad cow crisis,\" an AGL spokesman told Reuters. He said spring was usually high season for buying such equipment but this year purchases were being pushed back.

      "body": "<b>What did Greenspan do?</b> <br> He cut the Fed's key rate, to make borrowing cheaper and stimulate the flagging US economy through increased business investment and consumer spending. <p><b>How big was the cut? </b><br> As most market observers expected, Greenspan cut the rate by 50 basis points - or 0.5%. That brought the key rate down to just 5%. </p> <p><b>Who is Greenspan, exactly? </b><br> The most powerful single person in the world, many say. Every word he utters is carefully examined for nuance; every decision he makes is fraught with implications for the US and world economies. </p> <p><b>Is the US economy really on the skids? </b><br> Far from it. Unemployment and inflation are both low; consumer spending is high, and the federal budget, after years of soaring growth, is now in balance. But there are other, less tangible, factors in play. Business confidence is sagging, and there is a growing clamour of alarm about President George Bush's plans for swinging tax cuts. </p> <p><b>Will the interest rate decision have an effect on the world outside the USA? </b><br> You bet your life. Global stock markets are in a state of disarray verging on meltdown. It's worst in Japan: the Nikkei index stands at less than a third of its all-time high, and general deflation is leading the world's second biggest economy close to a full-scale depression. Tokyo has signalled its desperation by cutting interest rates to zero, to stimulate stagnant consumption. </p> <p><b>What about Britain? </b><br> Business leaders are clamouring for a urgent cut in the Bank of England base rate, to shore up the economy and prevent us sliding into recession in America's wake. Earlier this month, the Bank's monetary policy committee voted to keep the rate on hold at 5.5%. </p> <p><b>How is the stock market reacting? </b><br> There's doom and gloom on the stock exchange this morning.

      "bodyText": "What did Greenspan do? He cut the Fed's key rate, to make borrowing cheaper and stimulate the flagging US economy through increased business investment and consumer spending. How big was the cut? As most market observers expected, Greenspan cut the rate by 50 basis points - or 0.5%. That brought the key rate down to just 5%. Who is Greenspan, exactly? The most powerful single person in the world, many say. Every word he utters is carefully examined for nuance; every decision he makes is fraught with implications for the US and world economies. Is the US economy really on the skids? Far from it. Unemployment and inflation are both low; consumer spending is high, and the federal budget, after years of soaring growth, is now in balance. But there are other, less tangible, factors in play. Business confidence is sagging, and there is a growing clamour of alarm about President George Bush's plans for swinging tax cuts. Will the interest rate decision have an effect on the world outside the USA? You bet your life. Global stock markets are in a state of disarray verging on meltdown. It's worst in Japan: the Nikkei index stands at less than a third of its all-time high, and general deflation is leading the world's second biggest economy close to a full-scale depression. Tokyo has signalled its desperation by cutting interest rates to zero, to stimulate stagnant consumption. What about Britain? Business leaders are clamouring for a urgent cut in the Bank of England base rate, to shore up the economy and prevent us sliding into recession in America's wake. Earlier this month, the Bank's monetary policy committee voted to keep the rate on hold at 5.5%. How is the stock market reacting? There's doom and gloom on the stock exchange this morning. The key FTSE-100 index is dropping like a stone, having shed some 500 points in recent days to stand at just over 5500. That's more than 1400 points down on the historic peak achieved more than two years ago. As ever, British share traders are slavishly following the trend on Wall Street, which took a pasting in the wake of the Greenspan announcement. Does it not serve them right? To an extent, they are the victims of their own greed, especially those who piled into high-tech shares in 1999-2000, only to see their investments evaporate last March in the dot.com meltdown. But the stock market's gyrations are not confined to tech shares: after a remarkable \"bull\" run which lasted most of the 1990's, during which the value of shares rose by more than 12% every year, the market has now entered a pronounced \"bear\" phase, in which prices are under remorseless pressure. What does it mean for non-shareholders? Basically, just the same as for shareholders. If you have savings, a pension, or an insurance policy, you have a direct stake in the market.

Chronicle of a Death Foretold by Gabriel Garcia Marquez</strong><br>This is a perfect book.</p> <p><strong>2. Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad</strong><br>Unfashionable and troubled, this small novel is written with intense clarity - sentence for sentence it is still more unsettling than many unpleasant books that have been written since.</p> <p><strong>3. The Newton Letter by John Banville</strong><br>A reclusive academic becomes entangled in the lives of two women who live in a decaying big house. An exquisitely written, classic threesome: wanting both he gets neither, or half gets them? Or something.</p> <p><strong>4. Coup de Grace by Marguerite Yourcenar</strong><br>Another threesome, this time involving two men and a woman on the run from the Russian revolution. The wrong people fall in love and, in a wonderful denoument, the wrong people get killed.</p> <p><strong>5. Afternoon Raag by Amit Chaudhari</strong><br>Chaudhari's other books may be even better, but I am saving them for a rainy day. This is the story of a student who comes from Bombay to Oxford. Again there are two women, but in this version nothing at all seems to happen, in the most beautifully modulated way.</p> <p><strong>6. Eugene Onegin by Alexander Pushkin</strong><br>For the young girl in all of us. Onegin rejects Tatiana, then falls in love with her when it is too late. An incredibly graceful tale about the elusiveness of love.<br><strong><br>7. The Death of Napoleon by Simon Leys</strong><br>An elegantly sustained historical whimsy. Napoleon escapes St Helena, leaving a proxy to die in his place. When he returns to France, he finds that his great moment has passed.<br><strong><br>8. Good Morning Midnight by Jean Rhys</strong><br>Drink, desperation and the search for a good hat. Jean Rhys is a terrifying writer and here she is on familiar ground as she charts the nervy, banal disaster that is a woman on her way down.</p> <p><strong>9. The Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon</strong><br>This was the most exciting book of my adolescence: all the big questions packed into a small, highly ironic space. It was the first and neatest treatment of a very modern theme - too much information and the paranoia it provokes.</p> <p><strong>10. A Kid for Two Farthings by Wolf Mankovitz</strong><br>One of my favourite books as a child, this tale needs an adult reading to get the full poignancy. It tells the story of a boy in London's east end who buys a crippled goat that he thinks is a baby unicorn.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Anne Enright's latest novel, What Are You Like?, tells the tale of twins who are separated at birth and lead dislocated lives until finally they meet at the age of 25. Anne Enright is also the author of The Wig My Father Wore, and a collection of short stories, The Portable Virgin. Buy What Are You Like? at Amazon.co.uk 1. Chronicle of a Death Foretold by Gabriel Garcia Marquez This is a perfect book. 2. Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad Unfashionable and troubled, this small novel is written with intense clarity - sentence for sentence it is still more unsettling than many unpleasant books that have been written since. 3. The Newton Letter by John Banville A reclusive academic becomes entangled in the lives of two women who live in a decaying big house. An exquisitely written, classic threesome: wanting both he gets neither, or half gets them? Or something. 4. Coup de Grace by Marguerite Yourcenar Another threesome, this time involving two men and a woman on the run from the Russian revolution. The wrong people fall in love and, in a wonderful denoument, the wrong people get killed. 5. Afternoon Raag by Amit Chaudhari Chaudhari's other books may be even better, but I am saving them for a rainy day. This is the story of a student who comes from Bombay to Oxford. Again there are two women, but in this version nothing at all seems to happen, in the most beautifully modulated way. 6. Eugene Onegin by Alexander Pushkin For the young girl in all of us. Onegin rejects Tatiana, then falls in love with her when it is too late. An incredibly graceful tale about the elusiveness of love. 7. The Death of Napoleon by Simon Leys An elegantly sustained historical whimsy. Napoleon escapes St Helena, leaving a proxy to die in his place. When he returns to France, he finds that his great moment has passed. 8. Good Morning Midnight by Jean Rhys Drink, desperation and the search for a good hat. Jean Rhys is a terrifying writer and here she is on familiar ground as she charts the nervy, banal disaster that is a woman on her way down. 9. The Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon This was the most exciting book of my adolescence: all the big questions packed into a small, highly ironic space. It was the first and neatest treatment of a very modern theme - too much information and the paranoia it provokes. 10. A Kid for Two Farthings by Wolf Mankovitz One of my favourite books as a child, this tale needs an adult reading to get the full poignancy. It tells the story of a boy in London's east end who buys a crippled goat that he thinks is a baby unicorn.",

In the event, the central bank opted for another 0.5% reduction, the third in as many months, which took the key federal funds lending rate to 5%.

Hit Entertainment, which produces Bob the Builder, also hopes to raise its handyman's American profile after making his debut on the US children's network Nickelodeon this year. Speaking after Gullane is sued its results for the six months to January, Mr Harris said he was confident of the enduring appeal of the Thomas brand. \"Little boys will always love machinery and want to play with trains,\" he said. \"Producing products for children above pre-school age and into their teens is much more difficult. They can be extremely hard to predict.\" He added that Gullane's other well established products - which include television's Sooty and Captain Pugwash - were strongly in demand. Meanwhile, a part- nership deal has been secured with Disney for Gullane's Art Attack television show. Mr Harris said the company was developing a book publishing arm with with titles including Harry and a Bucket Full of Dinosaurs. Gullane is also thought to be looking at a number of acquisitions, also in the pre-school entertainment sector. The company posted pretax profits for the six months to January of \u00a34.28m, an increase of 80% on the same period last year on turnover up 78% at \u00a313.26m - excluding direct revenues from the Thomas feature film.",
