Use insiders</strong> </p> <p> Your best bet is likely to be a friend or acquaintance employed by your potential employer.

You might even want to jot down a few notes for them, and give them a quick summary of your qualifications and a copy of the job description in question. </p> <p> <strong> 6.

Julia was once a job-sharer herself and is now with the Industrial Society, advising undergraduates on how to get \"employment-ready\". If you don't remember anything else ... To job-share successfully, it's crucial, stresses Julia, that you are able to manage your time, to let go of control, and to work very, very closely with someone else. Fitting in with the working pattern of another person was the key for Kerry Prentice who works within production management for Boots in Nottingham. \"You've got to give yourself time to adjust to your job-share partner, particularly in getting to know how they work.\" If that doesn't sound like something you could manage, then you'd probably best stick to doing things the old-fashioned way and settle for just one full-time position.",

      "body": "<p>Cork is Ireland's second city, sunk into the valley where the river Lee meets the sea. Its centre is a small arrowhead-shaped island ringed with quays, just over a mile long and half a mile across. </p> <p>The city's architectural looks are difficult to define, but can be dated from the late Georgian period through to Victorian. Terraced townhouses, often individually painted, on three and four floors, mingle pleasingly with shops and ornate public buildings reflecting Cork's prosperity as a major European trading port throughout the 1800s. </p> <p>The city centre, being an island, has developed its own distinct calm \"village\" ambience. And with the nation's new prosperity, Cork has become a centre for arts and culture, attracting poets, painters and sculptors and especially those connected with music and dance. </p> <p>There is no sign of Celtic heritage. Cork's history begins with St Finn Barre in the 600s, followed by the Vikings and the Normans in the 12th century. It came to prominence in the mid 1700s as the staging and trading port primarily to America and the West Indies. Ships would be provisioned for long voyages carrying local exports of beef, butter, tallow and hides. Shipping also spawned the thriving industries of sail making and cooperage. </p> <p><strong> What to see</strong><br> </p> <p> A trip on the open-top bus (I\u00a38) is the quickest and most informative way of getting to grips with the city . The main sights, such as the Beamish Brewery on south Main with a 10.30am tour (I\u00a33), are located centrally. St Finn Barre's Cathedral, built in the 1860s on the site of the hermit saint's dwelling, is spectacularly executed in mosaics, stained glass and more than 1,200 carvings. </p> <p>Cork's thriving arts scene is enthusiastically competing with Dublin. The Crawford Art Gallery, built in 1724 at Emmet Place, shows the works of contemporary Irish artists as well as some old masters. The Vanguard Gallery on Careys Lane specialises in emerging Irish artists, while the Triskel Centre promotes visual and performing arts. </p> <p>The city's commercial and industrial history is best sampled at the public museum in Fitzgerald's Park, The Cork Vision Centre on North Main Street and the Butter Museum at Shandon, while the Old City Gaol of the 1800s gives an insight into the horrors of the convicts' lot. </p> <p><strong> Entertainment</strong><br> </p> <p> Try to take advantage of the theatrical dance and music events. The comedy club on Coburg Street is one of Europe's best, while the Victorian Everyman Theatre on MacCurtain Street is well respected for the quality of its production. The Firkin Cran Centre across the bridge at Shandon is home to the city's ballet company, while the Opera House at Emmet Place plays host to touring plays from Dublin, as well as concerts and musicals. </p> <p>\"The dogs\" are intrinsic to Irish culture, and the new Greyhound Stadium, which has racing every Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday, is only an eight-minute taxi ride from the centre. Entry, inclusive of an excellent three-course dinner, is I\u00a325. However, all racing is suspended at present due to the foot and mouth restrictions. </p> <p><strong> Out of town</strong><br> </p> <p> If you are seeking the \"eloquence of the silver tongue\", the Blarney Stone is 25 minutes away by bus. To the south lies Kinsale, where Charles II was crowned before going into exile. </p> <p>To the east is Cobh, just a short train-ride away. The 42-bell carillon at St Col man's rings out the Angelus. The Queenstown Experience, a reference to the period when the town was renamed in honour of Queen Victoria, has a much-praised interpretative centre that portrays the heartbreak of emigration. </p> <p>The extraordinary cult of road bowling is practised every Sunday at locations on the outskirts of the town. There are 100 clubs, so simply look for groups of people blocking the highway and lobbing steel balls down the road. There's also fishing, ranging from deep sea to catching trout on the Blackwater river. Or why not try your hand at sailing: Cork has the oldest yacht club in the world, established in 1720 - (00353) 21 4831023 <a href=\"http://www.royalcork.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.royalcork.com</a> - plus plenty of nearby golf courses. </p> <p><strong> Eating out</strong><br> </p> <p> On one side, there is the sea, so think fish. The other three sides are cattle country; so think quality beef. </p> <p> <strong> The Farmgate Caf\u00e9 </strong> , Old English Market, Princes Street, Cork (021 278134). The owner Kay and \"her gals\" always have an Irish \"traditional\" on the menu, such as lamb stew or tripe and drisheen (blood sausage). Around I\u00a36. </p> <p>Another \"must\" is <strong> Ballymaloe House</strong>, Shanagarry, 20 miles east of Cork (021 4652531). A large country house set amid 400 acres. Lunch costs I\u00a310-20; dinner I\u00a320-plus; booking is essential. The house incorporates a renowned cookery school, and if you decide to book a room, facilities included an outdoor swimming pool, tennis court, and children's play area. B&amp;B from \u00a385 for a single; \u00a3135 for a double. The owners of the Ballymaloe also run the <strong> Crawford Gallery Caf\u00e9</strong>, Emmet Place 021 4274415. </p> <p>At <strong> Caf\u00e9 Paradiso</strong>, 16 Lancaster Quay, Western Road (021 4274415), creativity is Bridgette and Dennis Cotter's theme. Try their almond pastry gallete with spinach, sheep cheese, aubergine and beans. Lunch: I\u00a3 3.50-\u00a37; Dinner: I\u00a3 15-18. Extensive wine list. </p> <p> <strong> Isaac's</strong>, 48 MacCurtain St (021 503805), is close to the Everyman theatre; booking is essential. Starters such as Caesar Salad from I\u00a35. Mains, such as king prawns, I\u00a320pp. Wines from I\u00a312. </p> <p> <strong> Proby's Bistro</strong>, Proby's Quay, Crosses Green (021 431 6531). Close to St Finn Barre's cathedral. Contemporary Euro cuisine. I\u00a325-plus per person. </p> <p><strong> Getting there</strong><br> </p> <p> British Airways (0845 7733377, <a href=\"http://www.britishairways.co.uk\">www.britishairways.co.uk</a> ) flies to Cork from a number of UK airports for \u00a3142.

      "bodyText": "Cork is Ireland's second city, sunk into the valley where the river Lee meets the sea. Its centre is a small arrowhead-shaped island ringed with quays, just over a mile long and half a mile across. The city's architectural looks are difficult to define, but can be dated from the late Georgian period through to Victorian. Terraced townhouses, often individually painted, on three and four floors, mingle pleasingly with shops and ornate public buildings reflecting Cork's prosperity as a major European trading port throughout the 1800s. The city centre, being an island, has developed its own distinct calm \"village\" ambience. And with the nation's new prosperity, Cork has become a centre for arts and culture, attracting poets, painters and sculptors and especially those connected with music and dance. There is no sign of Celtic heritage. Cork's history begins with St Finn Barre in the 600s, followed by the Vikings and the Normans in the 12th century. It came to prominence in the mid 1700s as the staging and trading port primarily to America and the West Indies. Ships would be provisioned for long voyages carrying local exports of beef, butter, tallow and hides. Shipping also spawned the thriving industries of sail making and cooperage. What to see A trip on the open-top bus (I\u00a38) is the quickest and most informative way of getting to grips with the city . The main sights, such as the Beamish Brewery on south Main with a 10.30am tour (I\u00a33), are located centrally. St Finn Barre's Cathedral, built in the 1860s on the site of the hermit saint's dwelling, is spectacularly executed in mosaics, stained glass and more than 1,200 carvings. Cork's thriving arts scene is enthusiastically competing with Dublin. The Crawford Art Gallery, built in 1724 at Emmet Place, shows the works of contemporary Irish artists as well as some old masters. The Vanguard Gallery on Careys Lane specialises in emerging Irish artists, while the Triskel Centre promotes visual and performing arts. The city's commercial and industrial history is best sampled at the public museum in Fitzgerald's Park, The Cork Vision Centre on North Main Street and the Butter Museum at Shandon, while the Old City Gaol of the 1800s gives an insight into the horrors of the convicts' lot. Entertainment Try to take advantage of the theatrical dance and music events. The comedy club on Coburg Street is one of Europe's best, while the Victorian Everyman Theatre on MacCurtain Street is well respected for the quality of its production. The Firkin Cran Centre across the bridge at Shandon is home to the city's ballet company, while the Opera House at Emmet Place plays host to touring plays from Dublin, as well as concerts and musicals. \"The dogs\" are intrinsic to Irish culture, and the new Greyhound Stadium, which has racing every Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday, is only an eight-minute taxi ride from the centre. Entry, inclusive of an excellent three-course dinner, is I\u00a325. However, all racing is suspended at present due to the foot and mouth restrictions. Out of town If you are seeking the \"eloquence of the silver tongue\", the Blarney Stone is 25 minutes away by bus. To the south lies Kinsale, where Charles II was crowned before going into exile. To the east is Cobh, just a short train-ride away. The 42-bell carillon at St Col man's rings out the Angelus. The Queenstown Experience, a reference to the period when the town was renamed in honour of Queen Victoria, has a much-praised interpretative centre that portrays the heartbreak of emigration. The extraordinary cult of road bowling is practised every Sunday at locations on the outskirts of the town. There are 100 clubs, so simply look for groups of people blocking the highway and lobbing steel balls down the road. There's also fishing, ranging from deep sea to catching trout on the Blackwater river. Or why not try your hand at sailing: Cork has the oldest yacht club in the world, established in 1720 - (00353) 21 4831023 www.royalcork.com - plus plenty of nearby golf courses. Eating out On one side, there is the sea, so think fish. The other three sides are cattle country; so think quality beef. The Farmgate Caf\u00e9 , Old English Market, Princes Street, Cork (021 278134). The owner Kay and \"her gals\" always have an Irish \"traditional\" on the menu, such as lamb stew or tripe and drisheen (blood sausage). Around I\u00a36. Another \"must\" is Ballymaloe House, Shanagarry, 20 miles east of Cork (021 4652531). A large country house set amid 400 acres. Lunch costs I\u00a310-20; dinner I\u00a320-plus; booking is essential. The house incorporates a renowned cookery school, and if you decide to book a room, facilities included an outdoor swimming pool, tennis court, and children's play area. B&amp;B from \u00a385 for a single; \u00a3135 for a double. The owners of the Ballymaloe also run the Crawford Gallery Caf\u00e9, Emmet Place 021 4274415. At Caf\u00e9 Paradiso, 16 Lancaster Quay, Western Road (021 4274415), creativity is Bridgette and Dennis Cotter's theme. Try their almond pastry gallete with spinach, sheep cheese, aubergine and beans. Lunch: I\u00a3 3.50-\u00a37; Dinner: I\u00a3 15-18. Extensive wine list. Isaac's, 48 MacCurtain St (021 503805), is close to the Everyman theatre; booking is essential. Starters such as Caesar Salad from I\u00a35. Mains, such as king prawns, I\u00a320pp. Wines from I\u00a312. Proby's Bistro, Proby's Quay, Crosses Green (021 431 6531). Close to St Finn Barre's cathedral. Contemporary Euro cuisine.

Many expert skiers, who have become bored with cruising around on gentle, groomed pistes, cannot live without the thrill of descending slopes that even mountain-climbers find difficult to ascend. I must confess, I am one of them. No longer able to get my adrenalin fix from ski-racing at 90mph, nowadays I often get my kicks from making jump turns on slopes where a fall could be perilous. </p> <p>On a <strong> 45-degree</strong> slope, you will be able to reach out and touch the ground above you, merely by stretching out your arm. Even to a confident expert skier, this will feel like a virtual precipice. We're now into the realm of \"extreme skiers\", now often referred to as \"big mountain freeriders\". </p> <p>At 55 degrees, you can touch the slope above you with your elbow. And around 60 degrees, there is a limit reached: sometimes the snow will not stick to slopes this steep. </p> <p>Not all snow types are identical. Wet snow is \"stickier\" than dry, powder snow, and therefore adheres to steeper slopes. So if you are seeking the challenge of extremely steep slopes, you should head for \"coastal\" mountain ranges close to the sea, where the snowfall is usually wet, heavy, and sticky. The Californian resorts are famous for steep skiing. But the Mecca of steep faces, with snow apparently impossibly clinging to them, is the Chugach range in Alaska. </p> <p>Before heading on to radically steep slopes, you should be properly prepared. Acquaint yourself with the <strong>self-arrest procedure</strong>, which can be used to stop yourself sliding uncontrollably once both your skis have released. This requires you to manoeuvre yourself around so that you're sliding on your stomach with your legs pointing downhill. Now, if you do a slow press-up, your toes will dig into the snow and bring you to a halt. </p> <p>Check the level of avalanche risk, and the stability of the current snowpack. If you're not an expert on snow layers, your best option is to consult your local ski patrol or mountain rescue service. </p> <p>Technically, the key to skiing steep slopes is to make sure your skis are pointing downhill for the minimum time possible. The best way to do this is to use <strong>jump turns</strong>, where you turn your skis by pivoting them entirely in mid-air. You need to take off from one set of edges, and land on the other. It is essential to land with your skis already tilted on to their edges so that they bite into the snow immediately, to prevent you sliding away and out of control. </p> <p>The only way to pivot your skis quickly enough to perform this type of turn is to rotate just your legs beneath you, while your upper body remains permanently facing down the slope. (This is a fundamental principle of all short turns.) </p> <p> A <strong> solid pole-plant </strong> is important for all short turns, but for jump turns on steep slopes, it is absolutely vital. As you jump your skis around, you are almost in a state of free-fall. This sensation is what makes steep skiing so exciting, but during that phase you need to support yourself by remaining in contact with Mother Earth, via your pole. </p> <p>The <strong> positioning of the pole-plant</strong> is also crucial; on flatter slopes, you can plant your pole in front of you, near your ski-tip - but on steeper slopes, you need to plant your pole further below you. This will help you keep your weight out over your downhill ski, providing a solid platform from which to launch into the next turn. Each time you finish a turn, you need to reach down the hill to make the pole-plant that will lead you into the next turn. </p> <p>The <strong> body shape</strong> you're looking for is a curved \"C\", with your knees and hips angulated into the slope, keeping your skis well edged, and your shoulders leaning out to the downhill side. Many timid skiers find this difficult, and tend to \"shy away\" instinctively from the slope below them, by leaning towards the uphill side with their shoulders. But this will make any edge grip impossible. Mastering steep slopes is all about overcoming your instincts and applying good technique. </p> <p>The final refinement of steep skiing is <strong>slough management</strong>. The slough is the stream of snow that your skis send cascading down the slope. It's not necessarily a full-on avalanche, just a lot of loose snow. If you find yourself turning through your own slough, it'll be difficult to see the ground, and if the snow is particularly heavy, you may even get swept off your feet. Free-skiing superheroes are often fast enough to outski their slough, but for mere mortals the solution is usually to slow down, and follow your slough down the mountain. </p> <p>If you crave adventure, try applying these technical rules, and start working your way up to steeper and steeper slopes. You'll find that when you go back to the \"normal\" pistes, they will seem strangely bland. </p> <p> Martin Bell is running ski courses for intermediate skiers this summer in Vail and Breckenridge, Colorado.

      "byline": "Jamie Wilson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Imagine finding the steepest, most frightening looking peak strewn with rocks, deep couloirs and vertical drops. Then climb to the top, click into your bindings and throw yourself off. If all goes well, you should arrive at the bottom a couple of minutes later after executing the odd bone-jarring 25m jumps, followed by a quick 360 and ending with a 60mph burst of speed. </p> <p>I could not imagine it either, which is why, despite a half-hearted invitation to ride with the current world freeride champion, I kept my skis firmly cramponed to the piste 1,000m or so below. </p> <p>If the hype is to be believed freeriding is the new snowboarding, and Tignes, one of the highest ski resorts in the French Alps, has set itself up as the freeride capital of Europe. Where once skiers feared to tread off piste, new ski design has allegedly made deep powder accessible even to the intermediate skier - which is me. </p> <p>With sales plummeting as snowboarding has stolen much of the youth market, the ski manufacturers realised they had to act fast if the sport was not to become confined to a dwindling band of old age pensioners. Their response was to produce the freeride ski: shorter and wider to keep you afloat on powder, made with more flexible material to allow you to land jumps without snapping a cruciate ligament, and twin tips - a ski that turns upwards at both ends - to allow backwards skiing and access to a half-pipe, previously the exclusive domain of snowboarders. This was a ski for the new generation - also me. </p> <p>I may be approaching 30 at the speed of a top downhill skier, but I'm still vaguely young at heart, and this ski was going to be my salvation. Tired of abuse from boarder friends who ridiculed my inability to venture off piste without ending up buried in a snow drift, the freeride ski was going to make me a powder hound. </p> <p>My confidence lasted about as long as it took to make the six-minute journey from the heart of the resort to the top of the Grande Motte funicular railway at 3,000m. With the Grand Motte glacier towering above us, my guide stopped and pointed his skis in the direction of what looked to me like a vertical face of snow. \"This looks OK,\" he said. I sidled up to the edge, gulped, and sidled back again. \"Do you know, I think I'll just warm up my legs a bit with a run down here,\" I said, pointing at the groomed piste that gently made its way down the side of the mountain. By the time we reached the bottom, he had me sussed. We made our way to the other side of the valley and a gentler slope. </p> <p>That is the thing about Tignes - it may not be the prettiest resort in the Alps, but for the skiing purist, it is hard to better. Jointly marketed with Val d'Is\u00e8re as \"L'Espace Killy\", after its most famous son, Tignes and Val d'Is\u00e8re offer almost unlimited powder fields, loads of on-piste cruising for all levels, as well as several snow parks. </p> <p>Arriving in the resort can be a bit of a shock. Instead of the pretty Alpine villages we passed through during the four-hour drive from Lyon airport, Tignes looks like a piece of Benidorm stuck on to the side of a mountain, with ugly 1960s blocks making up much of the accommodation. </p> <p>But the town planners have tried hard to rectify past sins. The resort is split into three levels and has undergone a multi-million-pound facelift over the past five years. Roads that used to run through the resort have been buried in underground tunnels and an enormous new reception chalet has been built from where you can do anything, from buying your ski pass to booking next year's chalet. New developments are also on the way, including sticking wooden cladding on the hotels in an attempt to make them prettier. </p> <p>A free bus service runs between the three levels of the resort that will take you back to your hotel if you have misread your piste map and find yourself at the wrong end with the lifts just closed for the night. </p> <p>The buses run until late in the evening and can also be used to get home from the bars at night, although to be honest if you are more interested in apr\u00e8s-ski than enjoying a day out on the slopes, Tignes is probably not the resort for you. Harry's bar is probably the pick of the bunch, with beer prices similar to the UK (about \u00a32) and a live band on Thursday nights. If you want to eat out, a fondue with wine costs around \u00a312 at L'Eterlou. </p> <p>But while Tignes might not be pleasing to the eye, the surrounding scenery certainly is. The mountain cirque - offering a 360-degree panorama - provides spectacular views both from the resort and the slopes. </p> <p>As we made our way across the valley, up above the professional freeriders were still doing their stuff on the face of Les Tufs, where the freeride world championships were held this week. Previously the world championships have been held in Alaska, but variable snow conditions saw the event move to Europe for the first time in its history this year. Watching the competitors hurtle down the slope made me more determined to find my feet, or should that be skis, on powder. </p> <p>As I pushed my way off the piste everything went well for about 10ft, until a fatal flaw in my skiing resurfaced - at the first sign of trouble, my instinct is to lean backwards. I dug myself out of the snow, and gingerly picked myself up, my guide generously blaming the conditions for my inability to stay upright.

      "bodyText": "Imagine finding the steepest, most frightening looking peak strewn with rocks, deep couloirs and vertical drops. Then climb to the top, click into your bindings and throw yourself off. If all goes well, you should arrive at the bottom a couple of minutes later after executing the odd bone-jarring 25m jumps, followed by a quick 360 and ending with a 60mph burst of speed. I could not imagine it either, which is why, despite a half-hearted invitation to ride with the current world freeride champion, I kept my skis firmly cramponed to the piste 1,000m or so below. If the hype is to be believed freeriding is the new snowboarding, and Tignes, one of the highest ski resorts in the French Alps, has set itself up as the freeride capital of Europe. Where once skiers feared to tread off piste, new ski design has allegedly made deep powder accessible even to the intermediate skier - which is me. With sales plummeting as snowboarding has stolen much of the youth market, the ski manufacturers realised they had to act fast if the sport was not to become confined to a dwindling band of old age pensioners. Their response was to produce the freeride ski: shorter and wider to keep you afloat on powder, made with more flexible material to allow you to land jumps without snapping a cruciate ligament, and twin tips - a ski that turns upwards at both ends - to allow backwards skiing and access to a half-pipe, previously the exclusive domain of snowboarders. This was a ski for the new generation - also me. I may be approaching 30 at the speed of a top downhill skier, but I'm still vaguely young at heart, and this ski was going to be my salvation. Tired of abuse from boarder friends who ridiculed my inability to venture off piste without ending up buried in a snow drift, the freeride ski was going to make me a powder hound. My confidence lasted about as long as it took to make the six-minute journey from the heart of the resort to the top of the Grande Motte funicular railway at 3,000m. With the Grand Motte glacier towering above us, my guide stopped and pointed his skis in the direction of what looked to me like a vertical face of snow. \"This looks OK,\" he said. I sidled up to the edge, gulped, and sidled back again. \"Do you know, I think I'll just warm up my legs a bit with a run down here,\" I said, pointing at the groomed piste that gently made its way down the side of the mountain. By the time we reached the bottom, he had me sussed. We made our way to the other side of the valley and a gentler slope. That is the thing about Tignes - it may not be the prettiest resort in the Alps, but for the skiing purist, it is hard to better. Jointly marketed with Val d'Is\u00e8re as \"L'Espace Killy\", after its most famous son, Tignes and Val d'Is\u00e8re offer almost unlimited powder fields, loads of on-piste cruising for all levels, as well as several snow parks. Arriving in the resort can be a bit of a shock. Instead of the pretty Alpine villages we passed through during the four-hour drive from Lyon airport, Tignes looks like a piece of Benidorm stuck on to the side of a mountain, with ugly 1960s blocks making up much of the accommodation. But the town planners have tried hard to rectify past sins. The resort is split into three levels and has undergone a multi-million-pound facelift over the past five years. Roads that used to run through the resort have been buried in underground tunnels and an enormous new reception chalet has been built from where you can do anything, from buying your ski pass to booking next year's chalet. New developments are also on the way, including sticking wooden cladding on the hotels in an attempt to make them prettier. A free bus service runs between the three levels of the resort that will take you back to your hotel if you have misread your piste map and find yourself at the wrong end with the lifts just closed for the night. The buses run until late in the evening and can also be used to get home from the bars at night, although to be honest if you are more interested in apr\u00e8s-ski than enjoying a day out on the slopes, Tignes is probably not the resort for you. Harry's bar is probably the pick of the bunch, with beer prices similar to the UK (about \u00a32) and a live band on Thursday nights. If you want to eat out, a fondue with wine costs around \u00a312 at L'Eterlou. But while Tignes might not be pleasing to the eye, the surrounding scenery certainly is. The mountain cirque - offering a 360-degree panorama - provides spectacular views both from the resort and the slopes. As we made our way across the valley, up above the professional freeriders were still doing their stuff on the face of Les Tufs, where the freeride world championships were held this week. Previously the world championships have been held in Alaska, but variable snow conditions saw the event move to Europe for the first time in its history this year. Watching the competitors hurtle down the slope made me more determined to find my feet, or should that be skis, on powder. As I pushed my way off the piste everything went well for about 10ft, until a fatal flaw in my skiing resurfaced - at the first sign of trouble, my instinct is to lean backwards. I dug myself out of the snow, and gingerly picked myself up, my guide generously blaming the conditions for my inability to stay upright. I was feeling a bit pathetic, but after speaking to Guerlain Chicherit, until this week at least the reigning freeride world champion, I strangely felt a good deal better. He told me that once he has finished freeriding his ambition is to break the world in-line skating record by being towed behind a car at more than 300mph. I might not be able to ski down Les Tufs, but at least I'm not certifiable.

      "body": "<p>Next time you can't face another day at work, try ringing your boss and telling him that it's raining, so you're not coming in. Sound far-fetched? Not to your opposite number on the island of Aruba, who won't think twice about placing such a call on witnessing an early morning downpour and whose boss will completely understand. </p> <p>So rare is it for the locals to come into contact with greasy roads that it's accepted they should stay at home rather than face treacherously wet Tarmac. It's lucky then for the island's economy that such conditions are so uncommon that the local newspapers rarely need to publish a weather bulletin - the Dutch dependency is virtually guaranteed an average rainfall of less than 20 inches a year. </p> <p>Tucked out of harm's way in the Dutch Caribbean, south of the hurricane belt, you'd be forgiven for a string of wild guesses as to Aruba's exact whereabouts. It's actually 15 miles off the Venezuelan coast, and it has never been a target for the Caribbean-bound Brit due to a perennial low-profile in travel agents' windows and the fact that, at present, you can't get a direct flight from the UK. The only way to get there is via Amsterdam with KLM, or Boston or Miami with American Airlines. </p> <p>This means that it's a hot spot for Americans fresh from the captain's table and wedding service. And although cruise-junkies and honeymooners may sound like strange company to keep if you're not partial to the former or party to the latter, you don't have to worry because the island has a sponge-like ability to soak them up and secrete them away on beaches, on the water, or in the desert-like interior. </p> <p>Arriving in peak season, which runs from January to April, when all the hotels are 80% to 100% full, you'd be forgiven for believing you'd arrived out-of-season, which is an admirable characteristic for an island that only takes up 70 square miles of the Caribbean Sea. Your choice of accommodation is confined to the white beaches and placid waters that line the southern side of the island, in contrast to the \"wild side\" to the north, which can only offer rocky coastline and choppy waters to those who fancy a change of scenery. Your options on the southern side are either to stay in Oranjestad, the old Dutch capital, or go further up the coast where a string of resorts stretch out to the western tip of the island. </p> <p>I stayed at the Aruba Sonesta Beach Resort in Oranjestad, which is at the heart of the Seaport Village just over the quiet main road from the cruise liners' disem barkation point. Unfortunately, the contribution of the cruise ships isn't limited to the ever-changing view they provide from the sea-facing hotel windows. The highly commercial nature of the sea-front \"strip\" - called L G Smith Boulevard - is dictated by the shopping needs of the cabin-fevered passengers that the vessels regularly disgorge. And Aruba obliges gratefully. Exclusive jewellers, outlets of Italian fashion houses, shopping malls and 24-hour casinos dominate the sidewalk. </p> <p>There isn't a great deal of nightlife on the island, and this puts the pressure on the restaurants to deliver something different, which, thankfully, they do. There are enough fast-food joints on the strip to trap the cruise crowds and keep the restaurants in the town at a suitably relaxed level. A good example is Le Dme, run by a group of Belgian visitors who were so impressed by Aruba that they transported a restaurant, brick-by-brick, over to the island and then installed themselves to cook their nation's cuisine to a very high standard for tourists and locals alike. There is an extensive selection of imported Belgian beers on offer, although you shouldn't dull your senses too much as the restaurant offers a fantastic atmosphere. </p> <p>Chez Mathilde, just a short walk away from the Sonesta resort, is a little more formal - an immaculately-decorated 19th-century homestead renowned for its seafood and imported beef. </p> <p>The only real disadvantage of staying in Oranjestad is that you're not directly on a beach and have to rely on pools and terraces to cool off. The big advantage of being a resident at the Sonesta, however, is that you have the exclusive use of a private island between 8am and 6pm. Water taxis dock in the elaborate lobby of the hotel every 15 minutes to take you out to the 40-acre retreat . It has been converted from an uninhabited reef island into a resort hideaway complete with gym, tennis courts, bar, restaurant, and \"family\" or \"adult\" lagoon beaches. </p> <p>Both beaches are attended by a team of waiters who seem to know instinctively when you are ready for a drink and are more than willing to save you the walk across hot sands to the bar. I saw more wildlife on this one island than I did anywhere else on Aruba, with iguana, flamingo, parrots and parakeets all helping to maintain the island 's fantasy feel. It's almost like a mini-holiday and, as such, I found it surprising that the place wasn't mobbed on a daily basis. One day I overheard two friends on board the last motor launch back to shore marvelling at how they had both spent the entire day on the island and hadn't seen each other once. </p> <p>Not that Aruba's public beaches could be called crowded, as you will see if you hire a car or take a taxi to any one of the seven miles of pure white sands that line the south coast. </p> <p>Of course, at some point you will feel the need to shake the sand from your crevices and find some action. A good way to do this is by exploring the island's interior by Land Rover, on one of De Palm Tours' safaris, a title that they can just about qualify by the dusty, desert-like terrain - complete with cacti and horse ranches - that you will drive through on one of their excursions. All they require is proof of a current driving licence and a few whoops of enthusiasm in a gung-ho briefing, and you'll qualify to fall in behind your guide as a convoy of 4x4s leave daily. </p> <p>After the usual adjustment to driving on the right, your guide will waste no time in hitting the island's dirt tracks and back roads that constitute the shortest route between the natural landmarks that make up the focal points of the tour - the California lighthouse, Bushibirana gold mill ruins and the natural bridge, all of which you would probably have driven past if the Aruban tourist board weren't there to give them a little bit more weight. </p> <p>The other way to avoid going sand-silly is on one of the many snorkelling or diving tours that operate from all the resorts and beaches on the island. Aruba has some of the best wreck diving in the Caribbean, which I considered useless information as my snorkel was destined for the sandbanks. However, a lot of these wrecks lie in waters shallow enough for snorkellers to explore, which is great for those of us who have looked enviously through our masks at the \"diver down\" flag and wondered what excitement and danger lay beneath. </p> <p>I wasn't disappointed as I snorkelled around the wreck of the Antilla - known locally as the \"ghost ship\" - which lies in 60ft of water and allows you to within a barnacle's reach of an immaculately preserved German freighter, the largest wreck in the Caribbean. Heading for home, I learned that the ship's fate was sealed in 1941 after the Germans invaded Holland. There was no loss of life, just a tense stand-off between the Dutch gun placements on shore and the Antilla's captain who eventually decided to scuttle his vessel and see out the rest of the war on Aruba. Given a similar excuse to stay, I would have done the same. </p> <p><strong> Way to go</strong><br> </p> <p> KLM (0870 5074074) flies London Stansted to Aruba, via Amsterdam from \u00a3553 return. An Ocean room (double) at the Sonesta Resort (002978 36000, <a href=\"http://www.arubasonesta.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.arubasonesta.com</a>) costs $265 a night until April 20, $200 a night April 21-Dec 21. De Palm Tours safaris cost $69, snorkelling cruises $29.50. Dinner at Le Dme costs $60 a head, plus drinks.</p>",

A good way to do this is by exploring the island's interior by Land Rover, on one of De Palm Tours' safaris, a title that they can just about qualify by the dusty, desert-like terrain - complete with cacti and horse ranches - that you will drive through on one of their excursions. All they require is proof of a current driving licence and a few whoops of enthusiasm in a gung-ho briefing, and you'll qualify to fall in behind your guide as a convoy of 4x4s leave daily. After the usual adjustment to driving on the right, your guide will waste no time in hitting the island's dirt tracks and back roads that constitute the shortest route between the natural landmarks that make up the focal points of the tour - the California lighthouse, Bushibirana gold mill ruins and the natural bridge, all of which you would probably have driven past if the Aruban tourist board weren't there to give them a little bit more weight. The other way to avoid going sand-silly is on one of the many snorkelling or diving tours that operate from all the resorts and beaches on the island. Aruba has some of the best wreck diving in the Caribbean, which I considered useless information as my snorkel was destined for the sandbanks. However, a lot of these wrecks lie in waters shallow enough for snorkellers to explore, which is great for those of us who have looked enviously through our masks at the \"diver down\" flag and wondered what excitement and danger lay beneath. I wasn't disappointed as I snorkelled around the wreck of the Antilla - known locally as the \"ghost ship\" - which lies in 60ft of water and allows you to within a barnacle's reach of an immaculately preserved German freighter, the largest wreck in the Caribbean. Heading for home, I learned that the ship's fate was sealed in 1941 after the Germans invaded Holland. There was no loss of life, just a tense stand-off between the Dutch gun placements on shore and the Antilla's captain who eventually decided to scuttle his vessel and see out the rest of the war on Aruba. Given a similar excuse to stay, I would have done the same. Way to go KLM (0870 5074074) flies London Stansted to Aruba, via Amsterdam from \u00a3553 return. An Ocean room (double) at the Sonesta Resort (002978 36000, www.arubasonesta.com) costs $265 a night until April 20, $200 a night April 21-Dec 21. De Palm Tours safaris cost $69, snorkelling cruises $29.50. Dinner at Le Dme costs $60 a head, plus drinks.",

      "body": "<p>What would that biography be like which managed to include every surviving record of a life? Every document, letter and journal entry? Every encounter, known movement, illustration? What we might call the total biography of an ordinary life could take us into the imaginative world of Jorge Luis Borges. In Funes the Memorious, Ireneo Funes is in the frightening situation of forgetting nothing. \"Two or three times he had reconstructed an entire day; he never once erred or faltered, but each reconstruction had itself taken an entire day.\" As, of course, it would have to. </p> <p>On Exactitude in Science describes map-makers' attempts to provide their country with larger, better maps: \"The map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province.\" In time, however, \"those Unconscionable maps no longer satisfied\". The cartographers \"struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it\". However, \"The following Generations... saw that that vast Map was Useless, and... delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars...\" </p> <p>The total map is like the reconstucted day, or the biography aiming at totality. All are interminable, all are useless. </p> <p>And yet... there is an instinct in all of us that biographies that are not in some sense complete cannot tell us what people's lives are like. If we miss things out on the grounds that they are unimportant, or because we have not space to include them, or because they do not fit the story we are trying to tell, then all we do is conceal our prejudices. </p> <p>In Middlemarch, George Eliot wrote about the normally selfish individual seeing him or herself as a \"supreme self\", around whose life and actions the rest of the world apparently falls into place so that, in her brilliant image, scratches made wholly at random on a mirror fall into concentric circles around a central source of illumination. She was, in effect, describing the technique of modern scholarly biography and nearly all popular biography, which remains stubbornly 19th century in its hero-or heroine worshipping concentration on the life of an individual. Lip service only is paid to the fact that the biographical subject was always the member of surrounding and overlapping groups of people, alive and dead. Modern biography at times seems to have learned almost nothing from history, sociology or even psychology, all of which constantly stress the impossibility of telling any kind of truth about individuals divorced from the impingeing lives and histories of other individuals. We write biographies of individuals as islands: we live as part of the main. </p> <p>Scholarly biography of Wordsworth and Coleridge has been bedevilled by a need to concentrate defensively upon the person about whom the biography is being written. Actions are interrupted, justified, explained (and explained away) from the point of view of the central figure: it is the others who behave badly. The practice of elevating one figure over the other has dominated Coleridge and Wordsworth biography for decades; to some extent because the very closeness of the two writers was later wrecked by savage disagreement. </p> <p>In his two-volume biography of Coleridge, Early Visions and Darker Reflections (Flamingo, 1999), Richard Holmes, a passionate defender of Coleridge, locates the poet's \"emergent feelings of rivalry with Wordsworth\" to autumn 1800, and gives an account of how Coleridge's poem Christabel came to be excluded from the second edition of Lyrical Ballads, which Coleridge and Wordsworth put together that year. Holmes concludes: \"The rejection of Christabel seems to have been a wholly unexpected blow for Coleridge.\" His account is similar to that which Thomas McFarland had offered in Romanticism and the Forms of Ruin, (1995) which states: \"Not only did Wordsworth manage to keep Christabel from being published in Lyrical Ballads\", but that it was an act of \"critical ineptitude\". </p> <p>Molly Lefebure, in her Sarah Coleridge biography The Bondage of Love (1987), also savagely attacked Wordsworth for his \"dismissal\" of Coleridge as a poet, and concluded: \"Wordsworth had no conception of the trauma he had inflicted upon Coleridge.\" So far as these three commentators are concerned, Wordsworth took a stupid decision, and Coleridge was the helpless (and damaged) victim.\" </p> <p>All three are drawing on the authoritative edition of Coleridge's letters, which states of Coleridge: \"After a tremendous expenditure of creative energy, he succeeded in composing part two of Christabel, before Wordsworth determined not to include it.\" But they carry the attack on Wordsworth still further, into accusations of a \"lack of generosity\" to his old friend. Holmes describes how, at the end of October 1800, Coleridge experienced \"a complete writing block\", and - like Lefebure - links the block to the damage Coleridge suffered from the rejection of Christabel. Lefebure goes further and states that Wordsworth's behaviour to Coleridge \"contributed significantly to... the moment when, poised as he already was on the verge of destruction by opium, he had his feet (metaphorically speaking) knocked from under him\". </p> <p>Both Holmes and Lefebure are repeating a charge that Stephen Parrish had made years earlier in Coleridge's Dejection: The Earliest Manuscripts and Earliest Printings, in a passage quoted by McFarland. They all write from the point of view of defenders of Coleridge; and this makes them critical of Wordsworth. </p> <p>The evidence for all their statements are some remarks in Coleridge's correspondence, and Dorothy Wordsworth's journal, describing Coleridge's visit to Town End, the house rented by the Wordsworths in Grasmere. The complete record of the visit in the journal is as follows: </p> <p>\"Saturday October 4 1800... Coleridge came in while we were at dinner very wet. We talked till 12 o'clock - he had sat up all the night before wrting Essays for the newspaper (the Morning Post). His youngest child [Derwent] had been very ill in convulsion fits... Exceedingly delighted with the 2nd part of Christabel. </p> <p>\"Sunday morning 5th October. Coleridge read a 2nd time Christabel - we had increasing pleasure. A delicious morning. Wm &amp; I were employed all the morning in writing an addition to the preface. Wm went to bed very ill after working after dinner - Coleridge and I walked to Ambleside after dark with the letter. Returned to tea at 9 o'clock. Wm still in bed &amp; very ill. Silver How in both lakes. </p> <p>\"Monday (October 6) A rainy day - Coleridge intending to go but did not get off. We walked after dinner to Rydale. After tea read The Pedlar. Determined not to print Christabel with the LB. </p> <p>\"Tuesday (October 7) Coleridge went off at 11 o'clock - I went as far as Mr Simpson's, returned with Mary. She drank tea here. I was very ill in the Evening at the Simpsons' - went to bed - supped there. Returned with Miss S and Mrs J - heavy showers. Found Wm at home. I was still weak &amp; unwell - went to bed immediately.\" </p> <p>Holmes concludes, after noting the decision not to print Christabel on October 6, \"There is no further comment. Coleridge left the next day, and Dorothy, 'weak and unwell' herself, went to bed early. One can conclude that it had been a stressful visit for all of them.\" One would be most unwise to reach that conclusion. The Wordsworths' illnesses were frequent, and they regularly went to bed during the day - or early to bed. To link Dorothy's illness of the evening of the October 7 with the Christabel decision taken 24 hours earlier looks wilful. And what about Wordsworth's illness of the fifth? A premonition of guilt? </p> <p>Holmes's version of what \"had happened\" is, in fact, a rhetorical attack on Wordsworth: </p> <p>\"What had happened was clear: Wordsworth, from a position of apparent weakness, had ruthlessly come to dominate the terms of the collaboration. Having used Coleridge - even, one might think, having exploited him - as adviser and editor, drawing him up to the Lakes for that very purpose, he had entirely imposed his own vision of the collection on the final text... Coleridge had submitted himself to Wordsworth in the most humiliating and damaging way; while Wordsworth had shown extraordinary insensitivity to the effect that this rejection would have on Coleridge's powers and self-confidence.\" </p> <p>What is extraordinary is that Holmes's powerful language should be based on a brief journal entry, a few notes of illness, and the idea that at the end of the month Coleridge may have suffered one of his numerous failures to write what was required of him. The evidence for the writing block so important to Lefebure and Holmes is a passage in one of Coleridge's notebooks describing - in the third person - a man who \"knew not what to do\". Coleridge himself wrote a wide-ranging letter to Josiah Wedgwood the following day, as unblocked as it is possible to imagine. </p> <p>Should the very great pleasure that both Wordsworths took in the poem, and which Dorothy twice stresses, play no part in how we understand what happened? </p> <p>Even more significant, however, is Coleridge's own statement to Josiah Wedgwood of November 1: \"I proceeded successfully - till my poem grew so long &amp; in Wordsworth's opinion so impressive, that he rejected it from his volume as disproportionate both in size &amp; merit, &amp; as discordant in it's character.\" This version of its \"rejection\" is quite different. It suggests that the poem was too good, too long, too different for Lyrical Ballads. </p> <p>Those who read the episode as Wordsworth's ruthless exploitation of poor Coleridge have another problem: the aftermath. The friendship between the two men continued, rich and untroubled for years. As his letter to Wedgwood shows, Coleridge felt no resentment. He justified the change of policy in letters to his friends. He continued to write prose for the Morning Post. And he continued to work on the Lyrical Ballads volume editorially; he even copied out for the printer the first 200 lines of Wordsworth's Michael, the poem that replaced Christabel.\" All Holmes can say to explain this remarkable behaviour is that \"Coleridge was slow to admit all this to himself\". That is, the subject of the biography did feel what the biographer tells us he must have felt, in spite of the evidence to the contrary. He was just rather slow in getting round to it. Holmes needs to escape the fact that the whole structure of exploitation and humiliation which he has erected has no foundation. </p> <p>It must be possible to write better biography than this. What is needed is biography that takes the writing of all the people concerned (diarists,housekeepers, letter writers and copyists as well as poets) as seriously as it does conversations and ideas: one that looks not only at Wordsworth from Coleridge's point of view, or vice versa, but at all their relationships. In my collective biography of the Gang - Coleridge's description of the close-knit group of friends in the Lake district in 1802, including the Hutchinson sisters, Sara and Mary, with whom he and Wordsworth respectively were in love - I have done that where surviving letters, poems and diaries allow. The material is, fortunately, not so extensive as to risk the production of one of Borges's totalising maps. </p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract from John Worthen's preface to The Gang: Coleridge, the Hutchinsons and the Wordsworths in 1802 (Yale University Press, price \u00a320.)</p>",

In Funes the Memorious, Ireneo Funes is in the frightening situation of forgetting nothing. \"Two or three times he had reconstructed an entire day; he never once erred or faltered, but each reconstruction had itself taken an entire day.\" As, of course, it would have to. On Exactitude in Science describes map-makers' attempts to provide their country with larger, better maps: \"The map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province.\" In time, however, \"those Unconscionable maps no longer satisfied\". The cartographers \"struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it\". However, \"The following Generations... saw that that vast Map was Useless, and... delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars...\" The total map is like the reconstucted day, or the biography aiming at totality. All are interminable, all are useless. And yet... there is an instinct in all of us that biographies that are not in some sense complete cannot tell us what people's lives are like. If we miss things out on the grounds that they are unimportant, or because we have not space to include them, or because they do not fit the story we are trying to tell, then all we do is conceal our prejudices. In Middlemarch, George Eliot wrote about the normally selfish individual seeing him or herself as a \"supreme self\", around whose life and actions the rest of the world apparently falls into place so that, in her brilliant image, scratches made wholly at random on a mirror fall into concentric circles around a central source of illumination. She was, in effect, describing the technique of modern scholarly biography and nearly all popular biography, which remains stubbornly 19th century in its hero-or heroine worshipping concentration on the life of an individual. Lip service only is paid to the fact that the biographical subject was always the member of surrounding and overlapping groups of people, alive and dead. Modern biography at times seems to have learned almost nothing from history, sociology or even psychology, all of which constantly stress the impossibility of telling any kind of truth about individuals divorced from the impingeing lives and histories of other individuals. We write biographies of individuals as islands: we live as part of the main. Scholarly biography of Wordsworth and Coleridge has been bedevilled by a need to concentrate defensively upon the person about whom the biography is being written. Actions are interrupted, justified, explained (and explained away) from the point of view of the central figure: it is the others who behave badly. The practice of elevating one figure over the other has dominated Coleridge and Wordsworth biography for decades; to some extent because the very closeness of the two writers was later wrecked by savage disagreement. In his two-volume biography of Coleridge, Early Visions and Darker Reflections (Flamingo, 1999), Richard Holmes, a passionate defender of Coleridge, locates the poet's \"emergent feelings of rivalry with Wordsworth\" to autumn 1800, and gives an account of how Coleridge's poem Christabel came to be excluded from the second edition of Lyrical Ballads, which Coleridge and Wordsworth put together that year. Holmes concludes: \"The rejection of Christabel seems to have been a wholly unexpected blow for Coleridge.\" His account is similar to that which Thomas McFarland had offered in Romanticism and the Forms of Ruin, (1995) which states: \"Not only did Wordsworth manage to keep Christabel from being published in Lyrical Ballads\", but that it was an act of \"critical ineptitude\". Molly Lefebure, in her Sarah Coleridge biography The Bondage of Love (1987), also savagely attacked Wordsworth for his \"dismissal\" of Coleridge as a poet, and concluded: \"Wordsworth had no conception of the trauma he had inflicted upon Coleridge.\" So far as these three commentators are concerned, Wordsworth took a stupid decision, and Coleridge was the helpless (and damaged) victim.\" All three are drawing on the authoritative edition of Coleridge's letters, which states of Coleridge: \"After a tremendous expenditure of creative energy, he succeeded in composing part two of Christabel, before Wordsworth determined not to include it.\" But they carry the attack on Wordsworth still further, into accusations of a \"lack of generosity\" to his old friend. Holmes describes how, at the end of October 1800, Coleridge experienced \"a complete writing block\", and - like Lefebure - links the block to the damage Coleridge suffered from the rejection of Christabel. Lefebure goes further and states that Wordsworth's behaviour to Coleridge \"contributed significantly to... the moment when, poised as he already was on the verge of destruction by opium, he had his feet (metaphorically speaking) knocked from under him\". Both Holmes and Lefebure are repeating a charge that Stephen Parrish had made years earlier in Coleridge's Dejection: The Earliest Manuscripts and Earliest Printings, in a passage quoted by McFarland. They all write from the point of view of defenders of Coleridge; and this makes them critical of Wordsworth. The evidence for all their statements are some remarks in Coleridge's correspondence, and Dorothy Wordsworth's journal, describing Coleridge's visit to Town End, the house rented by the Wordsworths in Grasmere. The complete record of the visit in the journal is as follows: \"Saturday October 4 1800... Coleridge came in while we were at dinner very wet. We talked till 12 o'clock - he had sat up all the night before wrting Essays for the newspaper (the Morning Post). His youngest child [Derwent] had been very ill in convulsion fits... Exceedingly delighted with the 2nd part of Christabel. \"Sunday morning 5th October. Coleridge read a 2nd time Christabel - we had increasing pleasure. A delicious morning. Wm &amp; I were employed all the morning in writing an addition to the preface. Wm went to bed very ill after working after dinner - Coleridge and I walked to Ambleside after dark with the letter. Returned to tea at 9 o'clock. Wm still in bed &amp; very ill. Silver How in both lakes. \"Monday (October 6) A rainy day - Coleridge intending to go but did not get off. We walked after dinner to Rydale. After tea read The Pedlar. Determined not to print Christabel with the LB. \"Tuesday (October 7) Coleridge went off at 11 o'clock - I went as far as Mr Simpson's, returned with Mary. She drank tea here. I was very ill in the Evening at the Simpsons' - went to bed - supped there. Returned with Miss S and Mrs J - heavy showers. Found Wm at home. I was still weak &amp; unwell - went to bed immediately.\" Holmes concludes, after noting the decision not to print Christabel on October 6, \"There is no further comment. Coleridge left the next day, and Dorothy, 'weak and unwell' herself, went to bed early. One can conclude that it had been a stressful visit for all of them.\" One would be most unwise to reach that conclusion. The Wordsworths' illnesses were frequent, and they regularly went to bed during the day - or early to bed. To link Dorothy's illness of the evening of the October 7 with the Christabel decision taken 24 hours earlier looks wilful. And what about Wordsworth's illness of the fifth? A premonition of guilt? Holmes's version of what \"had happened\" is, in fact, a rhetorical attack on Wordsworth: \"What had happened was clear: Wordsworth, from a position of apparent weakness, had ruthlessly come to dominate the terms of the collaboration. Having used Coleridge - even, one might think, having exploited him - as adviser and editor, drawing him up to the Lakes for that very purpose, he had entirely imposed his own vision of the collection on the final text... Coleridge had submitted himself to Wordsworth in the most humiliating and damaging way; while Wordsworth had shown extraordinary insensitivity to the effect that this rejection would have on Coleridge's powers and self-confidence.\" What is extraordinary is that Holmes's powerful language should be based on a brief journal entry, a few notes of illness, and the idea that at the end of the month Coleridge may have suffered one of his numerous failures to write what was required of him. The evidence for the writing block so important to Lefebure and Holmes is a passage in one of Coleridge's notebooks describing - in the third person - a man who \"knew not what to do\". Coleridge himself wrote a wide-ranging letter to Josiah Wedgwood the following day, as unblocked as it is possible to imagine. Should the very great pleasure that both Wordsworths took in the poem, and which Dorothy twice stresses, play no part in how we understand what happened? Even more significant, however, is Coleridge's own statement to Josiah Wedgwood of November 1: \"I proceeded successfully - till my poem grew so long &amp; in Wordsworth's opinion so impressive, that he rejected it from his volume as disproportionate both in size &amp; merit, &amp; as discordant in it's character.\" This version of its \"rejection\" is quite different. It suggests that the poem was too good, too long, too different for Lyrical Ballads. Those who read the episode as Wordsworth's ruthless exploitation of poor Coleridge have another problem: the aftermath. The friendship between the two men continued, rich and untroubled for years. As his letter to Wedgwood shows, Coleridge felt no resentment. He justified the change of policy in letters to his friends. He continued to write prose for the Morning Post. And he continued to work on the Lyrical Ballads volume editorially; he even copied out for the printer the first 200 lines of Wordsworth's Michael, the poem that replaced Christabel.\" All Holmes can say to explain this remarkable behaviour is that \"Coleridge was slow to admit all this to himself\". That is, the subject of the biography did feel what the biographer tells us he must have felt, in spite of the evidence to the contrary. He was just rather slow in getting round to it. Holmes needs to escape the fact that the whole structure of exploitation and humiliation which he has erected has no foundation. It must be possible to write better biography than this. What is needed is biography that takes the writing of all the people concerned (diarists,housekeepers, letter writers and copyists as well as poets) as seriously as it does conversations and ideas: one that looks not only at Wordsworth from Coleridge's point of view, or vice versa, but at all their relationships. In my collective biography of the Gang - Coleridge's description of the close-knit group of friends in the Lake district in 1802, including the Hutchinson sisters, Sara and Mary, with whom he and Wordsworth respectively were in love - I have done that where surviving letters, poems and diaries allow. The material is, fortunately, not so extensive as to risk the production of one of Borges's totalising maps. \u0095 This is an edited extract from John Worthen's preface to The Gang: Coleridge, the Hutchinsons and the Wordsworths in 1802 (Yale University Press, price \u00a320.)",

      "body": "<p>As soon as we landed in Belfast, Saira and I were drinking. I can't explain this. In normal life, we're hardly great quaffers, and we abhor - no, really - the dominant role alcohol occupies in others' lives. Nevertheless, within five hours of setting foot on the Tarmac of Belfast International, we were drunk. And the way we got drunk, I think, tells us a little about the kind of city Belfast is today. </p> <p>We started with good intentions, we really did. We had booked in for lunch at a restaurant called Ta Tu (sounds like \"tattoo\", and is one of the \"new breed of Belfast brasseries\" which is said to be helping Northern Ireland reinvent itself from war-torn province to hip weekend-break destination. Big chairs, modern industrial chic, chewy fishcakes, desserts with chillis on - it's that fashionable. Anyway, tired from the exhausting flight (any excuse), gin and tonics and wine helped make us perkier. But we wanted to see a bit of Belfast. We walked into the city centre - marvelling at how small the town is, to occupy such a huge space in our political landscape. </p> <p>We bought some books and some trinkets, we had a look at City Hall and Queen's University, which was near our hotel. But it was Saira's 30th birthday and we thought, to hell with it, who cares if it's still daylight, let's have some Guinness. Let's have a look at this craic. Let's put the \"fast\" into Belfast. First stop, then, was the famous gas-lit Crown Liquor Saloon, on Great Victoria Street, opposite the Europa Hotel (famously, the most bombed hotel in Europe). It's beautiful, with ornate Victoriana on the outside and cosy snugs for those secretive moments (though make sure you dodge the roaming webcam). </p> <p>Other favourites were The Morning Star (renowned for its food) and Kellys Cellars which, the barman told us, is Belfast's oldest pub, founded in 1720. Rather to our disappointment, there wasn't much discussion of the peace process in pubs, where pints seemed much more the point than politics. In fact, our English accents seemed profoundly uninteresting to most people we met. (Except, that is, for the Falls Road pub we entered, unaware of its reputation. In there, some drinkers turned their backs when they heard we were from England - although within the hour they were refusing to let us buy our own Guinnesses and proposing all kinds of things: eating, \"lerrrvin\", moving with them to New York.) </p> <p>Another interesting thing was the Guinness issue: we often found that we were the only people drinking it. Perhaps this could be seen as an expression of anti-Dublin sentiment; but it was the Falls Road where it seemed least popular. There, the hardest men were drinking brightly- coloured alcopops, forever divorcing the link between hardness and density of drink. Afterwards - yes, we still had some energy - Saira and I went to some clubs. First Robinson's, famous for its \"mixed clientele\" - which must have meant mixed communities and not ages, because the age range was about 18-19. Which is fine, for many. </p> <p>Next, we went to a place I really wouldn't recommend and probably shouldn't name since all the clubbers appeared to have been sniffing glue. We had most fun at the unbelievably hip Shine (we think it was on University Road), where we danced until the sun came up. And then we went to bed. After a first day like that, you might forgive our fragility and caution next morning - especially when presented with a majestic Ulster Fry (the recipe for this seems to be: take some foodstuffs; deep fry; fry again). Slowly, carefully, we set off to see some more of the north. </p> <p>In the pouring rain (I know it's a clich\u00e9, but Saira and I have been to Ireland together four times and each time it has rained incessantly; we credit this with why we always have an exceptionally brilliant time), we drove to Derry. We loved the place, with its narrow streets and elegance, and cursed our hangover-induced late arrival. We walked around the walls to the sound of traditional Irish music flooding out from the pubs. </p> <p>Testaments to Derry's troubled recent past are everywhere: the Bloody Sunday Trust, on Shipquay Street, with films, photographs and documents, is a permanent and sober memorial to the 13 civil rights protesters shot dead by British soldiers on Bloody Sunday in 1972; the murals in the Bogside and \"You Are Now Entering Free Derry\" sign are powerful reminders of the city's unique position in the history of the Troubles. (As are the signposts from Belfast to Londonderry: some spraypaint out the \"London\", others the \"Derry\", depending on whether the Tricolour or Union Jack is flying from the lamppost in that town.) The Bloody Sunday Trust, often staffed by relatives of the murdered, can give you directions on how to get to the Bogside from the city centre - it's a five-minute walk. </p> <p>After a good sleep, we set off the next day for some of Northern Ireland's natural delights - first stop, the Giant's Causeway. This was brilliantly weird. Thackeray said of it, \"When the world was moulded and fashioned out of formless chaos, this must have been the bit over - a remnant of chaos.\" It's impossible not to love such a freak of geology, though watch your step - particularly if it's pelting with rain, as it was, of course, for us. The Causeway was the work of a giant called Finn McCool - crazy name, crazy guy - who built it for his girlfriend, she-giant Staffa, so she could walk across from her home in the Hebrides. It's a great walk, and the air is wonderful. </p> <p>For lunch, we stopped in Bushmills, near to the Old Bushmills Distillery - the oldest whiskey distillery in the world. (They let you have a taste, which is great on a chilly day.) And, despite the weather, we kept pulling over the car to take in the gorgeous Antrim coastline, very bright and very blue. (Murlough Bay is particularly lovely.) We really wanted to try the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge, too: a bridge, made from rope, which suspends you over an 80ft chasm and out to sea. It's particularly famous because, now and again, some insane people choose to get married on it. Sadly it was closed because of the wild weather, but everyone says it's a trip. </p> <p>On our last day, we wanted to spend a little more time in Belfast. There is more, we said to each other, to the city than venues to get drunk in. Beyond the craic. First, we ate well at the charming Deanes Brasserie on Howard Street. Then, we got in touch with Black Taxi tours, a brilliant company with equal numbers of Catholic and Protestant drivers. (They ask you to guess which they are, at the end.) What followed was a truly extraordinary tour of the city, and one which I'd recommend a visitor to take from the moment they arrive. (Really - don't do what we did and leave something this good to the end.) Our entertaining, thoughtful and well-informed driver took us along the mural-laden Shankill Road (this the day after a shop had been bombed as part of a loyalist feud, a day when Protestant black cabs were too frightened to drive down the Shankill and, in an unprecedented move, were being allowed down the Falls instead); along the Falls, to compare the Catholic murals (including an extraordinary one featuring a poem by hungerstriker Bobby Sands); to Milltown cemetery, where many IRA men and women are buried. The tours are tailor-made to your interest, and I can't think of a better tour I've had anywhere. </p> <p>We were due at check-in, but a final pint was in order - a particularly creamy one at the Crown. And then another half - just to prolong our time in Belfast. This had its consequences: we had to dash to the airport, and squeezed into our seats with moments to spare. It was fascinating as well as fun; we got an education, as well as a skinful. Pretty much a perfect weekend, I'd say. </p> <p> <strong> Way to go</strong> </p> <p>Katharine Viner travelled to Northern Ireland as a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.

If the prime minister drops the pledge to have a referendum on the voting system that would be a betrayal of trust. It would end co-operation between our parties.\"</p> <p>Mr Ashdown was addressing a rally at the Lib Dem spring conference in Torquay, Devon. The Lib Dems are disappointed that Labour has failed to live up to its 1997 pledge to hold a referendum, although they welcomed the Jenkins commission on electoral reform which in 1998 recommended a system known as the alternative vote (AV) plus.</p> <p>Ministers who are in favour of reform, led by the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, remain confident that a referendum commitment will be included in the manifesto. But many Lib Dems are fearful that the prime minister will drop the pledge because \"big guns\" in the cabinet, such as Jack Straw and Gordon Brown, are wary of reforming Westminster's first-past-the-post system after it handed Labour such a handsome majority in 1997.</p> <p>Mr Ashdown made clear last night that it was in Labour's interests to embrace electoral reform to avoid the situation of the 1980s when the Tories dominated the political scene on less than 45% of the popular vote. \"Labour would pay a heavy price at the ballot box\" if there was no reform, he said, \"and would deserve to do so.\"</p> <p>As Lib Dem leader he had hoped to form a centre left coalition with the prime minister. Last night he said: \"It is such a disappointing government. They promised so much but have delivered so little. Because New Labour lacked courage they stuck to the Tory spending plans for the first two years and have actually spent less than the Tories during this parliament than the Tories did over the last one.\"</p> <p>Lord McNally, the Lib Dems' home affairs spokesman in the Lords, warned of \"all-out war between the two parties\" if there was no electoral reform.</p>",

It would end co-operation between our parties.\" Mr Ashdown was addressing a rally at the Lib Dem spring conference in Torquay, Devon. The Lib Dems are disappointed that Labour has failed to live up to its 1997 pledge to hold a referendum, although they welcomed the Jenkins commission on electoral reform which in 1998 recommended a system known as the alternative vote (AV) plus. Ministers who are in favour of reform, led by the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, remain confident that a referendum commitment will be included in the manifesto. But many Lib Dems are fearful that the prime minister will drop the pledge because \"big guns\" in the cabinet, such as Jack Straw and Gordon Brown, are wary of reforming Westminster's first-past-the-post system after it handed Labour such a handsome majority in 1997. Mr Ashdown made clear last night that it was in Labour's interests to embrace electoral reform to avoid the situation of the 1980s when the Tories dominated the political scene on less than 45% of the popular vote. \"Labour would pay a heavy price at the ballot box\" if there was no reform, he said, \"and would deserve to do so.\" As Lib Dem leader he had hoped to form a centre left coalition with the prime minister. Last night he said: \"It is such a disappointing government. They promised so much but have delivered so little. Because New Labour lacked courage they stuck to the Tory spending plans for the first two years and have actually spent less than the Tories during this parliament than the Tories did over the last one.\" Lord McNally, the Lib Dems' home affairs spokesman in the Lords, warned of \"all-out war between the two parties\" if there was no electoral reform.",

      "body": "<p>Damning evidence was revealed yesterday showing how Keith Vaz, the foreign office minister, and his lawyers tried repeatedly to halt, obstruct and finally censor a parliamentary investigation into allegations about unregistered donations from business colleagues. A 291-page dossier revealing the background to the year-long inquiry - which eventually cleared Mr Vaz of the most serious allegations - shows the minister and his lawyers treated the investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner, Elizabeth Filkin, with barely disguised contempt.</p> <p>The latest disclosures were seen last night as further undermining Mr Vaz's shaky position in the government because of the tenor of the language in the increasingly bitter exchanges between the MP's lawyers and the commissioner.</p> <p>Mr Vaz originally planned to have a press conference to denounce the media \"witch-hunt\" against him, but this was cancelled when he is said to have seen how much information had been released by parliament about the inquiry.</p> <p>The report reveals that Mr Vaz's lawyers sought to excise from the public report allegations from Claire Ward, the Labour MP for Watford, that a previous Labour party inquiry into Mr Vaz's Leicester East constituency had been halted before half the people making allegations against the MP had given evidence.

      "bodyText": "Damning evidence was revealed yesterday showing how Keith Vaz, the foreign office minister, and his lawyers tried repeatedly to halt, obstruct and finally censor a parliamentary investigation into allegations about unregistered donations from business colleagues. A 291-page dossier revealing the background to the year-long inquiry - which eventually cleared Mr Vaz of the most serious allegations - shows the minister and his lawyers treated the investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner, Elizabeth Filkin, with barely disguised contempt. The latest disclosures were seen last night as further undermining Mr Vaz's shaky position in the government because of the tenor of the language in the increasingly bitter exchanges between the MP's lawyers and the commissioner. Mr Vaz originally planned to have a press conference to denounce the media \"witch-hunt\" against him, but this was cancelled when he is said to have seen how much information had been released by parliament about the inquiry. The report reveals that Mr Vaz's lawyers sought to excise from the public report allegations from Claire Ward, the Labour MP for Watford, that a previous Labour party inquiry into Mr Vaz's Leicester East constituency had been halted before half the people making allegations against the MP had given evidence. They also sought to ban evidence from Mr Vaz's main rival for the Leicester East seat, Sir Peter Soulsby, a former Labour leader of Leicester council, claiming that the MP was the subject of complaints to the Law Society when he had a job in a council law centre because he had not got all his qualifications. The report shows Geoffrey Bindman, Mr Vaz's lawyer, becoming increasingly angry about Ms Filkin's handling of the case. At one stage he writes: \"Mr Vaz is exceedingly concerned at the lack of clarity in your investigation, in which you have repeatedly confused evidence, rumour, speculation and allegation and have not given Mr Vaz any clear indication of what the case is against [him] or the evidence in support of it. The incoherence, repetition and lack of method in your approach have led to its inordinate length, which has been very damaging to my client.\" Last night Mr Vaz said the report showed that he and Mr Bindman had responded in a \"full and frank manner\" to all Ms Filkin's questions. \"At no time in the evidence does the commissioner or the committee make any allegation that my solicitor or I were seeking to obstruct their inquiry. \"The correspondence shows that I was, at all times, willing to answer any question that the committee wished me to answer. The detailed nature of Mrs Filkin's and the committee's investigation revealed the lack of evidence supporting the allegations made against me.\" He said he had written to Ms Filkin 39 times and gave evidence to her for two and a half hours and to the committee for five hours, answering more than 500 questions.

In its belated response to the Commons public accounts committee, which in November accused ministers and officials of \"unwarrantable arrogance\" in blaming the pilots, the MoD yesterday insisted that negligence was the only possible explanation for the loss of a Chinook helicopter on the Mull of Kintyre in 1994. Flight Lieutenants Jonathan Tapper and Rick Cook died with two other aircrew and 25 senior members of the Northern Ireland intelligence community when Chinook ZD576 crashed into the cloud-covered Mull. RAF rules stated that deceased aircrew could be blamed for crashes only in cases where there was absolutely no doubt. The air force's board of inquiry said a major technical malfunction could not be ruled out, but two air marshals overruled the board and blamed the pilots - effectively a verdict of manslaughter. In its unanimous report, the public accounts committee found that technical problems, especially with the Chinook's computerised engine control system, meant there were clear grounds to doubt the pilots had been negligent. It concluded: \"We simply cannot understand why the [MoD] continues to defend the unsustainable finding of gross negligence and recommend it should be set aside.\" In its five-page response, which should have been delivered a month ago, the MoD said: \"The department does not agree that sustaining a properly reached judgment of a board of inquiry constitutes unwarrantable arrogance.

I would be glad if your judgment could be issued as soon as possible and that it be done publicly.\"</p> <p><b> February 16</b></p> <p>Mr Vaz writes to Mrs Filkin to say he was contacted by the Sunday Telegraph about Mr Zaiwalla.

Mr Vaz objects at the meeting and provides his own note taker, who cannot take shorthand. Instead, Mrs Filkin asks him to fill in a questionnaire covering 48 points.</p> <p><b> July 5</b></p> <p>Mr Bindman writes to Mrs Filkin objecting to her handling of the meeting. He says: \"Mr Vaz is extremely concerned at the lack of clarity in your investigation in which you have repeatedly confused evidence, rumour, speculation, and allegation, and have not given Mr Vaz any clear indication of what the case is against Mr Vaz or the evidence in support of it. The incoherence, repetition and lack of method in your approach have led to its inordinate length, which has been very damaging to my client.\"</p> <p><b> July 10</b></p> <p>Mrs Filkin acknowledges his letter and Mr Bindman writes back demanding a substantive reply. He attacks one of the witnesses, Sir Peter Soulsby, former leader of Leicester city council, claiming Mrs Filkin is \"being used as a vehicle for pursuing a political wrangle\". He raises her connection with Sir Peter when she was on the audit commission.</p> <p>He goes on to say: \"It is extraordinary that newspaper reports or evidence of journalists should form the basis of any investigation of an MP.\"</p> <p><b> July 11</b></p> <p>Mrs Filkin replies saying she is involved in a fact finding investigation which \"is not a judicial process nor an adversarial one.\" She says she has received replies to only some of her questions and lists the others again, adding: \"I trust the above allows Mr Vaz to deal with my questions.\"</p> <p><b> July 17</b></p> <p>Mr Bindman says Mr Vaz has \"complied assiduously with all your requests\" and answered up to 100 questions. \"His duty to disclose information must be matched, however, by a duty on your part to limit your investigation to matters which are relevant and based on evidence.\"</p> <p><b> July 18</b></p> <p>Mrs Filkin replies insisting on direct answers to seven questions he has still not answered.</p> <p><b> August 3</b></p> <p>Mr Bindman says Mrs Filkin has \"no credible evidence to support any of the allegations\" and attacks her for pursuing Mr Vaz for answers to all the 48 questions.</p> <p>\"To proceed in this way is unfair and oppressive. Unless you are able to produce any evidence which would justify an adverse finding it seems to me that you cannot responsibly do otherwise than reject the complaints which have been made without further delay.\"</p> <p><b> August 11</b></p> <p>Mrs Filkin says she has no further points to put to Mr Vaz and asks him to reply without delay.</p> <p><b> August 22</b></p> <p>Mr Bindman replies accusing her of \"a repeated failure to respond to my requests to supply evidence\" and says of the alleged payments from Mr Zaiwalla that \"it is frankly inexplicable that nearly three months after my letter of 25 May you apparently continue to pursue this complaint\".

      "bodyText": "Details of the yearlong dispute between Keith Vaz, the Europe minister; his lawyer, Geoffrey Bindman; and Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, reveal an increasingly abusive battle between the parties. The letters show how an initial complaint from one former employee of City solicitor Sarosh Zaiwalla, who worked closely with Mr Vaz, grew into a wide ranging inquiry, eventually covering 18 allegations against the minister. The commissioner's investigations were paralleled by inquiries by the Sunday Telegraph and the Sunday Times, increasingly angering Mr Vaz, who demanded assurances from Mrs Filkin that she was not talking to the papers and a ban on her taking evidence from journalists. They also show in graphic detail how Mr Vaz's lawyers went to enormous lengths to object to the way the commissioner conducted the inquiry, even blocking taping or the use of a shorthand writer to record exactly what was said at an interview between her and the minister. At the same time Mr Bindman continually demanded that Mr Vaz be cleared months before the commissioner completed her work. The correspondence shows an increasingly vituperative tone, ending with a request from Mr Vaz's lawyer for most of the report to be kept secret, a request denied by the commissioner. February 4 2000 Mrs Filkin first writes to Mr Vaz notifying him of two complaints from Andrew Milne, a former employee of lawyer Sarosh Zaiwalla, that Mr Vaz was given \u00a32,000 and used his influence to stop an inquiry into Mr Zaiwalla's tax affairs. February 7 Mr Vaz replies saying \"there is not a shred of evidence\" to support this. \"I am confident you will find there is no basis for this allegation... I would be glad if your judgment could be issued as soon as possible and that it be done publicly.\" February 16 Mr Vaz writes to Mrs Filkin to say he was contacted by the Sunday Telegraph about Mr Zaiwalla. He says the story is untrue and refers to these \"maliciously false claims of Mr Milne\". February 22 Mrs Filkin writes to Mr Vaz saying she has been contacted by Brian Brown, a former employee of Mr Zaiwalla, saying Mr Vaz was paid \u00a31,000 by Mr Zaiwalla. February 29 Mr Vaz replies saying he has \"nothing to add... could you advise me what protection is there for MPs who have to face completely untrue allegations and who subsequently have to defend their reputations in the media? Is there a parliamentary sanction to deal with this?\" March 3 Mrs Filkin replies with fresh allegations about other payments involving Mr Zaiwalla and a complaint from Paul Gosling, a Leicester journalist. March 7 Mr Vaz writes saying \"please do not apologise for asking for more information\" and offers to deal promptly with Mr Gosling's complaint. March 8 Mrs Filkin sends the text of the complaints. March 13 Mr Vaz replies attacking Mr Brown and Mr Milne for providing \"malicious falsehood\" and saying the charges have \"now become a fiasco... are they in contempt of parliament for seeking to mislead the parliamentary commissioner or is there no rule containing frivolous or vexatious complaints?\" March 14 Mrs Filkin sends him 10 fresh allegations involving undeclared donations from businessmen and asks him to comment. March 19 Mr Vaz denies the allegations, claiming the complaints \"form an orchestrated campaign by two journalists\" and questions whether some of the complainants are genuine because of \"the illegibility of their signatures\". April 3 Mr Vaz writes to Mrs Filkin telling her he has instructed Geoffrey Bindman to act for him. May 18 Mr Bindman writes to Mrs Filkin saying \"let Mr Vaz or me know precisely what questions you consider to remain outstanding so that if possible I can deal with them in my submissions next week\". May 25 Mr Bindman writes a long letter to Mrs Filkin outlining the allegations and Mr Vaz's response and the procedures used in her inquiry. He tells her: \"Even if Mr Vaz is completely exonerated and is not criticised in your report, his reputation will not easily recover from the damage it has suffered as a result of this investigation. In my submission there is no basis for any criticism.\" He adds that Mr Vaz is the subject of \"media harassment\" and asks her not to communicate with the media. June 7 Mrs Filkin lists the allegations and asks for a response, and says she has not commented to the media about them. June 15 Mr Bindman replies thanking her for the list and asking for a speedy settlement of the case. But he asks for clarification of Mr Vaz's breaches of the MPs' code of conduct. June 16 Mrs Filkin replies with the details and promises to act quickly. June 29 Mrs Filkin supplies Mr Vaz with a list of questions she wants Mr Vaz to answer at a meeting and says she will tape the proceedings. There follows a telephone conversation with Mr Bindman in which he asks for no tapes of the meeting. \"Mr Vaz is adamant that at the moment he would not take part in a meeting that was taped.\" Mrs Filkin proposes a House of Commons shorthand writer take notes instead. July 3 Mr Bindman telephones and says Mr Vaz may object to a shorthand writer taking notes. Mr Vaz objects at the meeting and provides his own note taker, who cannot take shorthand. Instead, Mrs Filkin asks him to fill in a questionnaire covering 48 points. July 5 Mr Bindman writes to Mrs Filkin objecting to her handling of the meeting. He says: \"Mr Vaz is extremely concerned at the lack of clarity in your investigation in which you have repeatedly confused evidence, rumour, speculation, and allegation, and have not given Mr Vaz any clear indication of what the case is against Mr Vaz or the evidence in support of it. The incoherence, repetition and lack of method in your approach have led to its inordinate length, which has been very damaging to my client.\" July 10 Mrs Filkin acknowledges his letter and Mr Bindman writes back demanding a substantive reply. He attacks one of the witnesses, Sir Peter Soulsby, former leader of Leicester city council, claiming Mrs Filkin is \"being used as a vehicle for pursuing a political wrangle\". He raises her connection with Sir Peter when she was on the audit commission. He goes on to say: \"It is extraordinary that newspaper reports or evidence of journalists should form the basis of any investigation of an MP.\" July 11 Mrs Filkin replies saying she is involved in a fact finding investigation which \"is not a judicial process nor an adversarial one.\" She says she has received replies to only some of her questions and lists the others again, adding: \"I trust the above allows Mr Vaz to deal with my questions.\" July 17 Mr Bindman says Mr Vaz has \"complied assiduously with all your requests\" and answered up to 100 questions. \"His duty to disclose information must be matched, however, by a duty on your part to limit your investigation to matters which are relevant and based on evidence.\" July 18 Mrs Filkin replies insisting on direct answers to seven questions he has still not answered. August 3 Mr Bindman says Mrs Filkin has \"no credible evidence to support any of the allegations\" and attacks her for pursuing Mr Vaz for answers to all the 48 questions. \"To proceed in this way is unfair and oppressive. Unless you are able to produce any evidence which would justify an adverse finding it seems to me that you cannot responsibly do otherwise than reject the complaints which have been made without further delay.\" August 11 Mrs Filkin says she has no further points to put to Mr Vaz and asks him to reply without delay. August 22 Mr Bindman replies accusing her of \"a repeated failure to respond to my requests to supply evidence\" and says of the alleged payments from Mr Zaiwalla that \"it is frankly inexplicable that nearly three months after my letter of 25 May you apparently continue to pursue this complaint\". He denies all the other complaints. October 3 Mrs Filkin writes to Mr Bindman still pursuing some questions and saying she may have to put some additional points before she prepares her draft memorandum to the committee. Further letters from her follow on October 12 and October 19. November 2 Mr Bindman says \"this is a most unsatisfactory and improper way to conduct an investigation which conflicts with natural justice... you have repeatedly ignored my objections over many months and have failed to give adequate answers to my questions. ...This cavalier approach conflicts with your own description of an investigation process... I have pointed out the absence of any evidence against my client in virtually every case ...you have merely asked a whole lot more questions, many of inexplicable relevance.\" November 9 Mrs Filkin replies: \"It seems to me we have a difference of opinion and further correspondence on this point is unlikely to be helpful. I am sure you will agree that 'this is most unsatisfactory and an improper way to conduct an investigation' was said tongue in cheek but for the record I certainly do not agree.\" November 27 Mrs Filkin writes a final letter with her last set of questions to clear up some points. December 4 Mr Bindman replies saying: \"There may be an irreconcilable difference of opinion between us as to the propriety of your procedure, your view that you are holding a mere fact finding inquiry is untenable and even if correct could not conceivably justify throw ing to the winds the most basic procedural safeguards, as important for an MP as anyone else whose reputation and career are vulnerable to false or malicious accusations. \"My client is confident that he has answered all relevant questions and is not prepared to answer further questions.\" December 6 Mrs Filkin replies saying her questions are relevant.

      "body": "<p>The rural revolt which began rolling in Cumbria yesterday was understandable but dangerous. Why, asked one angry farmer, was the government setting out to kill healthy sheep when it was already finding difficulty in disposing of the carcasses of diseased sheep already slaughtered? A succession of farmers told reporters they would refuse access to the ministry teams seeking to start the new cull. The size of the cull - as many as 1m farm animals, mostly sheep but some pigs - startled many people. More worrying still was the clear signal of a divided farming community, with some farmers now unwilling to cooperate in the national strategy to stamp out foot and mouth disease. The cooperation of the farming community has been crucial in the effort to eradicate the disease, with a majority of the outbreaks being identified by farmers, not by visiting vets.</p> <p>There are two reasons for the new cull. First to create a firebreak, in the hope of stopping the spread of the disease. The number of cases continued to rise yesterday. The chief vet wants to pre-empt the disease with a preventive cull. In the much more confined outbreak of 1967, it took 31 days to reach its peak. This year's outbreak, so far 25 days old, could take much longer. Hence the switch to more drastic action. All animals which have been in touch with sheep handled by two dealers and three markets - Welshpool, Northampton, and Longtown (near Carlisle) - will be slaughtered. And three kilometre wide slaughter zones are being introduced round infected farms in Cumbria and Dumfries and Galloway. Within them all sheep and pigs will be slaughtered. Vets have found that the infection rate in these two areas has become so intense that even healthy sheep have become carriers.</p> <p>Both moves make sense. Without them, even more farms will become infected. Though over 200,000 animals have been earmarked for slaughter from 260 farms, Britain's 157,000 livestock holdings have 50m animals. The country's - and farmers' - lucrative export markets will not be regained until the disease is eradicated. To its credit, the National Farmers Union supports the cull, even though its local Cumbrian branch is opposed. Both the National Pig Association and the Conservative opposition have signalled their support. The agriculture secretary and chief vet have both promised to visit Cumbria.

Thomson Snowboarding (www.thomson-snowboarding.co.uk, 020-8939 5466 ) is offering seven-night packages starting at \u00a3375. The price includes return flights from Gatwick or Manchester, transfers to/from the resort, B&amp;B in two-star accommodation, a six-day local lift pass covering the Mayrhofen ski area and airline board carriage. The self-drive price is \u00a3260pp. For further details on the event itself, visit www .snowsport.uk.com. Skiers and snowboarders desperate for one last blast on the snow - and prepared to arrange their own transport to the Alps - could take advantage of some short breaks from self-catering specialist Interhome (020-8891 1294, www.interhome.co.uk). Between March 17 and April 14, it is offering accommodation at Siviez in Switzerland's Four Valleys, which has lift access to the slopes of Verbier . Three nights' rental of a studio for two people starts at \u00a3114. And, if you can get to the French resort of Chamonix in the next week or so, the firm has breaks of similar length available in two-room apartments from \u00a3134 for up to four people. Seven nights for the price of six are also on offer until the end of April elsewhere in France. A two-room apartment in Alpe d'Huez costs from \u00a3215 and a studio for 2-4 people in the Trois Vall\u00e9es resort of Les Menuires starts at \u00a3331.

I believe that the Labour government has handled the foot and mouth epidemic very efficiently to date.</p> <p>They reacted immediately to the situation, following the precedent set in 1967, by moving into infected farms and slaughtering the sheep and cows carrying the disease. They did this in the face of criticisms born of ignorance. Immunisation was said to be a kind answer to the problem but it would have wrecked our reputation overseas and, consequently, would have destroyed our export market.</p> <p>The same critics fail to mention that reimmunisation has to take place every six months. That would have made the idea economically unviable. So I support government policy, but in the near future Tony Blair must take action of a more dramatic nature to save our agriculture industry.</p> <p>I am concerned that, in times of plenty, governments forget about foot and mouth and its potential to break out without warning. It is such a virulent disease - communicable even by air - that it is ever present in different parts of the globe. Our last major outbreak was 34 years ago when dead meat from Argentina was the carrier, although the Isle of Wight was hit in 1981, when the virus came from Brittany.</p> <p>It is therefore inevitable that we will be struck by another outbreak in the future and we must learn the lessons of today.</p> <p>In the short-term, the government must release funds as quickly as possible to compensate the farmers, some of whom are in desperate straits. The European Union is showing the way by making 180m euros available and Westminster must act with similar urgency.</p> <p>When the current crisis subsides, a clearly defined financial mechanism should be set up to save the farmers from future ruin and intolerable stress. The common agricultural policy has historically created an artificial marketplace which rewards over-production. Reforms should bring farming in line with consumer demand. This will release funds and allow a financial cushion for the inevitable future outbreaks of this horrific disease. This will work to the benefit of British farmers. New Zealand has successfully followed a similar policy.</p> <p>In the longer-term, I have a suggestion that will, doubtless, offend everyone with a sentimental yearning for the James Herriot days of farming, when market day was followed by a convivial few drinks in the Drovers' Arms. I believe that the trading of livestock must be conducted by computer. This is how it will work.</p> <p>Westminster should immediately provide farmers and auctioneers with laptops and the appropriate software to commence trading. Then, information technology training classes should be laid on at rural colleges with lesson times to suit the busy farmers. Investment from Westminster will be negligible but the impact on farming will be dramatic. On the websites, information about the size, carcass weights, dimen sions and ancestry of livestock will be available and the details will be verified by the auctioneer. He will go to the farm, instead of the animals travelling to him.</p> <p>The risk of disease if farmers buy and sell over the internet will be minimal because they will not infect one another. The closure of small abattoirs in 1995 and the growth of larger markets caused animal movement to increase dramatically. By internet trading the animals will be less stressed from repeated transportation and the quality of their meat will, consequently, be better - benefiting both the animals and the consumers.</p> <p>From an animal welfare viewpoint, small abattoirs are also much less frightening to the beasts than the huge ones and the quality of staff is often better. It will also be an environmentally friendly system. We will see fewer livestock trucks travelling the motorways, with their terrified cargoes. Many don't realise that animals are shunted around the country by people who are traders, not farmers at all. Animals now move from a small market such as Hatherleigh in Devon to a mid-level market a hundred miles away before being transported again and slaughtered. This is what happened when William Cleave transported sheep from his 11 farms for trading purposes - thereby unwittingly contaminating innumerable others. Computerised auctions will short-circuit this cruel and expensive practice.</p> <p>It will also will cut down costs in other ways. Consider how many man-hours are lost by farmers and their stockmen on market days and think of the travelling expenses involved in transporting these beasts from one auction to another. All that will be in the past.</p> <p>Most crucially, however, electronic trading will enable British farmers to reach a wider market. These skilled and undervalued professionals have a high quality product. Computerisation will enable them to sell at higher prices. The initial investment will be repaid 10-fold and they will reap the rewards they deserve.</p> <p>These long-term measures must be taken if we are to save our farmers from ruin. And I write these words not as a distant MEP with an interest in new technology, but as one who was raised on a small farm and who once represented West Devon and Torridge - the largest agricultural constituency in the UK.</p> <p>A pilot project, along the lines described, was started in Dartmoor by a farmer, John Dawe, some years ago but nobody picked it up. I tried to promote it at the time but the Conservative government was not interested. This time we must follow through the idea.</p> <p>If we do then small markets, market towns and rural communities will thrive again.

The planning guidance, which ensures that school governors are consulted on the siting of masts under 15 metres and allows for more extensive public consultation, follows a report from a government task force . The report found that masts meeting international standards on radiation protection were safe but criticised the lack of consultation. Mr Raynsford said it was not for local councils to make judgments about health safeguards, but all proposed developments would have to meet government and internationally-approved guidelines. Mr Raynsford said he would be calling in mobile phone operators to discuss plans for a map showing the position of all masts which would be made available on a website. The government has also invited schools with masts to register for an audit of mobile phone base stations and masts to assess emissions. Yesterday the minister said that the first 20 audits showed that the highest level of exposure to radiation was a tiny fraction of the maximum permitted by international standards.

Canada Banff (***) has some good on-piste skiing, although the off-piste is still patchy and would benefit from a huge dump. Fernie (***) also needs new snow, with icy conditions in the morning turning to slush by the afternoon. On-piste conditions are hard in Whistler (****), but softening during the day. No snowflakes = a serious lack of snow - no lifts open. * = poor snow conditions, very few lifts open. ** = conditions reasonable, some slopes in poor condition. *** = plenty of good skiing. **** = good conditions. ***** = fantastic on and off piste.

      "body": "<p>Once again I think I've found my dream home in Ireland. But this time, it's not on the fashionable West Coast in Connemara or Galway. I came across it just an hour away from Dublin in the beautiful Wicklow mountains, surprisingly wild country where craggy summits and deep blue loughs have been glacier-carved from granite mountains six times older than the Alps. </p> <p>The isolated whitewashed and slate-roofed cottage stands on the golden, gorse-clad banks of the Cloghoge River, just where it spills into the crystal waters of Lough Dan. The deserted cottage was sheltered by a spreading sycamore and seemed to have no services to it, but a more idyllic spot would be hard to find. </p> <p>We'd walked down from the Sally Gap road that leads up from Roundwood, descending steeply to the shores of Lough Tay through a violent hailstorm to emerge ruddy-faced into the bright sunlight of a perfect day as we strolled around the lough through banks of heady, coconut-scented gorse to end the walk at Oldbridge. Such is Irish weather; if you don't like it, wait a few minutes and it'll change. </p> <p>Looking down on Lough Tay just before the storm broke, our genial walking guide, Christopher Stacey of Footfalls Ireland, pointed out the imported white sandy beach in front of the Guinness family mansion of Luggala Lodge at the head of the black waters of the lough. The comparison to a cream-headed pint of the famous family stout was temptingly obvious. </p> <p>Further down the valley of the Cloghoge, Christopher showed us the sad but evocative overgrown remains of a \"township\", like so many that feature in the Irish rural landscape. These ruins may have been abandoned after the 1798 uprising, when the valley's nationalist rebels were massacred and their houses burnt down. Or they may simply have been deserted during the dark days of the potato famine of the 1840s. </p> <p>It's strange how, as in the deserted crofts of the Scottish Highlands or the slate villages of Snowdonia, places that once rang with the sound of human voices seem so much more lonely now than real wildernesses. Only deer from the adjacent forest inhabit these largely unfrequented ways, where you are constantly walking in the footfalls of history. </p> <p>Wicklow, the East Coast and the Midland counties of Louth and Meath lie at the heart of a different Ireland from the better-known destinations over in the West. In many ways, they represent the real heart of Ireland, largely untouched by mass tourism yet rich in wonderful landscapes, a lively culture, and a history that stretches back 5,000 years to the first megalithic builders in European history. </p> <p>The region's best-known prehistoric site is Newgrange, one of Ireland's top tourist attractions. But to visit the impressively-restored Neolithic passage tomb, you'll have to queue and wait on a timed ticket to experience the reconstruction of the winter solstice sun flooding into the inner chamber. </p> <p>Instead, go to the Loughcrew cairns near Oldcastle in County Meath, where nearly 30 almost identical tombs are scattered over four green hilltops, each commanding superb 360-degree views over the lush countryside. You'll be able to walk in solitude from cairn to cairn, marvelling at the superb \"rock art\" engravings on the walls of the tombs, which are every bit as intricate and fascinating as those at Newgrange. </p> <p>Our guide here was local auctioneer and enthusiastic amateur archaeologist Oliver Usher, of Kelltic Walking Holidays, based in nearby Kells. As we stood outside the padlocked gate (you get the key from a local farm) to the Slieve na Callaigh (The Hag's Hill) tomb, Oliver enthused: \"Every time I come here, there's a different light and the carvings take on a different aspect. Beautiful is not an adequate enough word to describe it.\" </p> <p>Once inside the tomb, we saw exactly what he meant. As our eyes became adjusted to the soft natural light flooding in through the entrance, the swirling patterns of spirals, cups, rings, zig-zags and floral designs seemed to move and come to life. We suddenly felt very close to that prehistoric past, in an almost spiritual experience which could be savoured and enjoyed. </p> <p>We also found the real Ireland alive and well in the thatched Sheeran's Inn in the tiny hamlet of Coolrain, in County Laois. The legendary Chieftains have performed here, and the members of the Half Door Club wholeheartedly throw themselves into the intricate steps and whirling gigs of traditional set dancing. This owes nothing to the highly-commercialised Riverdance-style of Irish dancing but is a vital, vigorous and highly-orchestrated \"set\" of steps, involving much noisy stamping of feet and twirling of partners. </p> <p>Live music is a tradition at Sheeran's, but what impressed me most was the age range of the dancers. Sprightly pensioners and portly farmers joined the bright young things of the village, including a nimble-footed 16-year-old lad who you'd have thought would have been more likely to be found on the front row of a Corrs concert, not dancing the night away with the old fogies in the local pub. </p> <p>Earlier, our explorations had taken us on an arduous traverse of 1,932ft Slieve Foye on the Cooley peninsula overlooking Carlingford Lough, with the blue shapes of the Mountains of Mourne peeping over the hills across the water. </p> <p>This area is famed in Irish mythology as the main setting for Tain Bo Cuailgne, or the Cattle Raid of Cooley, when the legendary Queen Maeve attempted to capture the Brown Bull of Cooley so that she could prove she was wealthier than her husband. </p> <p> You can follow the Tain (pronounced \"Torn\") Way, a 25-mile walking route around the sites of their momentous battles, or cycle or drive the 350-mile Tain Trail Touring and Cycling Route from Roscommon to the scene of the final bloody denouement on that wild and rocky Cooley peninsula. </p> <p>From near here, we looked down on the volcanic Ring of Guillion across the border in County Armagh, a famous example of a caldera, or collapsed volcano, where army helicopters now haunt the skies like great prehistoric pterodactyls. </p> <p>We also walked along part of the 43-mile circular Slieve Bloom Way, a disappointing route which mainly treks through vast blocks of uniform conifers, rather than sticking to the boggy summits above. In our efforts to escape from the claustrophobic conifers, we foolishly forged ahead of our guide, completely missed the yellow Slieve Bloom Way signs, and got hopelessly lost before coming down on a road three miles from where we were supposed to be. Only the magic of the mobile phone reunited the party. </p> <p>But there was beauty in the steep-sided coombes and the waterfalls of Glenbarrow, and an early-morning excursion to the misty 1,729ft summit of Arderin, once known as \"the Height of Ireland\" because it was thought to be the country's highest point, was rewarded with fine views which justified its ancient title. </p> <p>Another unheralded gem was the tiny township of Fore in Westmeath, famed for its Seven Wonders. One of the most amazing is the 2\u20ac-ton stone lintel said to have been raised by the local saint, Feichin, by the power of prayer to its position above the doorway of his now-ruined church. </p> <p>The superstitious or desperate still hammer coins into the trunk of a sacred ash tree (another wonder because it won't burn), or attach rags or ribbons to its branches. </p> <p>There are many fairy trees in this part of Ireland, usually gnarled and twisted old hawthorns which local people refuse to disturb for fear of upsetting the \"little folk\". Needless to say, there were several of these trees on the way down to my cottage by the Cloghoge. I hope at least one of them will see fit to grant my wish. </p> <p> <strong> Way to go</strong><br> </p> <p> Aer Lingus (0845 9737747) flies to Dublin from Manchester from \u00a392 return including tax, and from London Heathrow from \u00a395 return. Roly Smith stayed at B&amp;Bs booked through East Coast and Midlands Tourism, Dundalk (00353 44 48761), including The Ivy House, Blackrock, Co Leath (00353 42 93 21753); White Gables, Headfort Place, Kells, Co Meath (00353 46 41097); Beech Hills Lodge, Mounthrath, Co Laois (00353 502 35097); and the Derrybawn Mountain Lodge, Glendalough, Co Wicklow (00353 404 45644).

But there was beauty in the steep-sided coombes and the waterfalls of Glenbarrow, and an early-morning excursion to the misty 1,729ft summit of Arderin, once known as \"the Height of Ireland\" because it was thought to be the country's highest point, was rewarded with fine views which justified its ancient title. Another unheralded gem was the tiny township of Fore in Westmeath, famed for its Seven Wonders. One of the most amazing is the 2\u20ac-ton stone lintel said to have been raised by the local saint, Feichin, by the power of prayer to its position above the doorway of his now-ruined church. The superstitious or desperate still hammer coins into the trunk of a sacred ash tree (another wonder because it won't burn), or attach rags or ribbons to its branches. There are many fairy trees in this part of Ireland, usually gnarled and twisted old hawthorns which local people refuse to disturb for fear of upsetting the \"little folk\". Needless to say, there were several of these trees on the way down to my cottage by the Cloghoge. I hope at least one of them will see fit to grant my wish.

Of the Arena chapel, Padua, Fry wrote: \"Giotto has touched a chord of feeling at least as profound as can be reached by the most consummate master of the art of words.\" So why not read pictures? </p> <p>In the case of Alberto Manguel, the answer might be that he seems ill-equipped as a guide because of an incapacity to do the other part of the job. One example will serve: discussing Picasso's paintings around Guernica , he writes of the \"haphazard canvases\" portraying Dora Maar, Picasso's muse for the weeping woman with baby in Guernica ; but in all art history there are no portraits less random than these cubist-based paintings.

But if this is a book with almost nothing useful to say about painting as such, it is full of suggestive ideas about social forces and their effect on art.

      "bodyText": "Reading Pictures: A History of Love and Hate Alberto Manguel 337pp, Bloomsbury, \u00a330 Buy it at a discount at BOL One forgets that Roger Fry, who more than anyone educated his countrymen into an appreciation of the \"formal relations\" in painting, wrote almost equally of their literary power. Of the Arena chapel, Padua, Fry wrote: \"Giotto has touched a chord of feeling at least as profound as can be reached by the most consummate master of the art of words.\" So why not read pictures? In the case of Alberto Manguel, the answer might be that he seems ill-equipped as a guide because of an incapacity to do the other part of the job. One example will serve: discussing Picasso's paintings around Guernica , he writes of the \"haphazard canvases\" portraying Dora Maar, Picasso's muse for the weeping woman with baby in Guernica ; but in all art history there are no portraits less random than these cubist-based paintings. At a guess, Manguel means to describe the way Picasso fractures and reformulates his sitter's features; but that's not what he says.

      "body": "<p>When the Parisian-born George Steiner went to Chicago University after the second world war, he found himself sharing a room with an ex-paratrooper, who stared in disbelief at \"a creature so obviously cosseted, sheltered, formally decked out, book-laden, as I was\", Steiner recalled. It was as though a quaint figure from a rarefied age of central European humanism, now all but vanquished by Nazism and war, had come face to face with the ascendant era of transatlantic mass <br>culture, embodied by the war veterans swelling American campuses under the GI bill.</p> <p>Yet the budding critic, who was to become famous as an impassioned proselytiser for <br>European \"high\" culture, was in awe of his room-mate. He compared the paratrooper's crouching leap on to a top bunk - a feat the diminutive \"bookworm and privileged mandarin Jew\" could never hope to match - to the transfixing grace of a Nureyev.</p> <p>Steiner has remained a paradoxical and contentious figure. A polyglot and polymath, he is often credited with recasting the role of the critic by exploring art and thought unbounded by national frontiers or academic disciplines. Though he distrusts the \"self-serving jargon\" of critical theory, his books, beginning with Tolstoy or Dostoevsky (1958) and The Death of Tragedy (1960), have posed philosophical questions about the humanities and their relationship to 20th-century history, most centrally about language and its debasement in the post-Holocaust age.</p> <p>He commends the \"autism\" of the scholar and claims to despise the mass media, yet has had a prominent voice in journalism, as a critic for the New Yorker, the Times Literary Supplement and the Observer. While Steiner sits more easily in a French intellectual tradition (and was last month given the French order of arts and letters), he came to Britain in the early 1950s, where his questioning presaged new fields years before comparative literature, or studies of translation or the Holocaust were established.</p> <p>The novelist AS Byatt admires Steiner as a \"late, late, late Renaissance man... a European metaphysician with an instinct for the driving ideas of our time\". Lisa Jardine, professor of Renaissance studies at Queen Mary college, University of London, recalls \"a rebel who made us aspire to being Europeans; he helped move British culture from utter provincialism to cosmopolitanism, and taught us to listen to language - how language carries the thread of morality and philosophy.\"</p> <p>Steiner's new book, Grammars of Creation, based on his 1990 Gifford lectures, is out next week. With a characteristically broad sweep, it questions the nature of creativity in an age of atheism - a line of inquiry the author believes is \"still almost a taboo\".</p> <p>It is also certain to find detractors. AC Grayling in the Literary Review dismisses the book as \"pretentious intellectual bombast\" written in a \"writhingly Latinate\" style. The familiar criticisms include: verbosity, stating the <br>obvious, name-dropping, hyperbole, misquotation, obscurantism and a self-dramatising taste for the apocalyptic. Even friends acknowledge that Steiner's immense range comes at the price of inaccuracy.</p> <p>While he admits making errors, critics accuse him of complacency. According to Jay Keyser, professor emeritus of linguistics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Steiner was told at a seminar in the 1970s that, while he had written at length on Dostoevsky's use of the definite article, there was no such thing in Russian. \"It was as though a fly had landed on his shoulder,\" says Keyser. \"A criticism that should have been devastating made no impact.\"</p> <p>Unrepentant, Steiner continues to advocate generalisation over specialisation. His Bronowsky lecture in London earlier this month insisted that the notion of what it is to be literate must encompass knowledge of both arts and sciences, bridging CP Snow's \"two cultures\" divide. Its title, borrowed from Bottom in Midsummer Night's Dream, was Master, Spread Yourself.</p> <p>Steiner lives in Cambridge, where he has been extraordinary fellow at Churchill College since 1969. His wife, Zara, an authority on international relations, is a former vice-president of New Hall. Their son, David, and daughter, Deborah, are both academics in the US.</p> <p>While he is known as deeply serious, he reveals a deadpan humour. Once asked if he had ever read anything frivolous as a child, he replied: \"Moby Dick.\" He has said that the critic casts a eunuch's shadow: \"Who would be a critic if he could be a writer?\" Today, quoting Pushkin's \"savagely arrogant but irrefutable statement that he writes the letters and we carry them\", he calls himself a \"mail man\". But throughout his career, Steiner has delivered, with a sense of urgency, a message of his own, rooted in his view of the Holocaust (he prefers the term Shoah) as the defining catastrophe of our age.</p> <p>He was born in 1929 in Paris, to Viennese parents who had left the \"cradle of Nazism\" five years before. He describes his father, a Bohemian \"within reach of the ghetto\" who became a senior lawyer in the Austrian Central Bank, as \"formidable in his insight: he saved us from Hitler and was clear-sighted in a way that broke his heart\". Though dismissed by more sanguine Viennese Jews as a \"tedious Cassandra\", Steiner's father \"thought deeply about politics, and saw Nazism was an Austrian, not a German phenomenon - he could smell it in the air. He thought Jews were endangered guests wherever they went, and wanted to equip his <br>children - my elder sister and myself - with languages to earn a living, the ability to pack a suitcase rather than a steamer trunk, and take joy in the adventure. If he transmitted one thing to me, <br>it was how lucky I am to be under pressure.\"</p> <p>Steiner's mother, who lamented the \"irrational\" move from Vienna, was also formidable. \"I was severely handicapped,\" says Steiner, who was born with a withered right arm. \"Due to Maman, I overcame it. She was a Viennese grande dame, radiant, multilingual, wonderfully ironic. For her, self-pity was nauseating.\" Becoming left-handed was not an option. \"From her came the conviction that if it's difficult, it must be fun and worth doing. Today the rule of benevolent therapy is to buy shoes with zippers. I could have had them. It took 10 months for me to learn to tie a lace; I must have howled with rage and frustration. But one day I could tie my laces. That no one can take from you. I profoundly distrust the pedagogy of ease.\"</p> <p>Steiner's mother was apt to \"begin a sentence in one language and end it in another\", and he grew up with \"three mother tongues\" - French, German and English. He was reading Shakespeare in English and Homer in ancient Greek by the age of five. His father, who took him to museums every Saturday, taught him \"worship of the classic\". </p> <p>\"My father loved poetry and music. But deep in himself he thought teaching the finest thing <br>a person could do,\" says Steiner. \"I learned early on that 'rabbi' means teacher, not priest.\" His father was also, Steiner recalls, a man of stern principle, \"whatever the price\". Working in Paris for an American investment bank, he was summoned to base in 1937 but refused to take the only liner leaving Cherbourg because it was flying the German flag. It cost him his job. \"History was always in attendance,\" Steiner wrote in Errata: An Examined Life (1997), his brief and curiously reticent memoir. </p> <p>So, it seems, was luck. In 1940 the family went on a trip to New York, where Steiner's father insisted they remain. Within a month, the Nazis had occupied Paris. Of the many Jewish pupils in Steiner's lyc\u008ee class in the affluent 16th arrondissement, he was one of only two who survived. He spent the war years at the French lyc\u008ee in Manhattan, and became a US citizen in 1944. </p> <p>As \"a kind of survivor\" - the title of a 1965 autobiographical essay - Steiner feels not the guilt of those who emerged from the camps, but bafflement. \"Why me? Why did I deserve to get away?\" Part of the legacy was a sense of obligation. \"My whole life has been about death, remembering and the Holocaust,\" he says. \"Namelessness was Hitler's taunt - 'Who remembers the Armenians?' I've had to be a 'remembrancer'.\"</p> <p>He became a \"grateful wanderer\" (\"Trees have roots and I have legs; I owe my life to that\"). Following a spell at the Sorbonne after the war, he preferred Chicago University to Yale, where Jews were \"consigned to a ghetto of pinched politeness\". It was as an undergraduate in Chicago that he found his vocation, unlocking the mysteries of learning for GIs in exchange for instruction in more earthly pleasures. His paratrooper room-mate, Alfie, took him to to hear Dizzy Gillespie, taught him poker - which he later abandoned for chess - and procured a prostitute for him at 19. \"He made my passage into adulthood caring, gentle and funny - free from neurosis,\" Steiner recalls.</p> <p>After Harvard, Steiner went as a Rhodes scholar to Balliol College, Oxford. But when his DPhil thesis - a draft for The Death of Tragedy - was initially refused, he worked for the Economist as a leader writer from 1952-56. He met Zara Shakow, a New Yorker of Lithuanian descent, in London at the instigation of mutual friends, who laid bets on their getting married - which they did in 1955. After two years at Princeton, Steiner became a founding fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, in 1961.</p> <p>The essays of Language and Silence (1967) set out lifelong themes, which echo in his more recent collection, No Passion Spent (1996). As the author wrote, \"They took their substance and much of their 'voice' from the legacy of Ernst Bloch, of [Theodor] Adorno, of Walter <br>Benjamin and from the inheritance of Jewish poetic-philosophic investigations of the word. The mapping of my identity, the inward orientations, remain those circumscribed by Leningrad, Odessa, Prague and Vienna on the one side, and by Frankfurt, Milan and Paris on the other.\"</p> <p>For the Irish novelist and critic John Banville, it was an electrifying moment: \"A door was flung open on what had been there all the time, at our backs, namely, our European heritage. He told us not to be cowed by insularity or hidebound by small minds, but to look beyond the border.\"</p> <p>According to Bryan Cheyette, professor of 20th-century literature at Southampton university, Steiner was \"the first telling those who would listen in Britain about Heidegger, Benjamin and Paul Celan - the great German philosophers and poets. Now work on those figures is an industry, but he was a lone voice in the 60s.\"</p> <p>In Steiner's view, totalitarianism and the slaughters of 1914-45 had destroyed the assumption that literary culture is a custodian of humane values - self-evident to such figures as Dr Johnson, Coleridge, Matthew Arnold and FR Leavis. \"Some of the men who devised and administered Auschwitz had been trained to read Shakespeare and Goethe,\" he wrote, suggesting \"the paradox that modern barbarism sprang in some intuitive, perhaps necessary way, from the very core and locale of humanistic civilisation\". </p> <p>Partly inspired by Orwell, Steiner's 1959 essay The Hollow Miracle saw the German language itself as complicit in Nazism. He warned that language has a \"breaking point\", lies and sadism settling \"into the marrow\". As Adorno had said, \"No poetry after Auschwitz\", Steiner asked if the only response was a retreat into silence. Yet he took heart in such writers as Paul Celan and G\u009fnter Grass, assaulting postwar amnesia to confront the unspeakable, and so revealing the unexpected resilience of language.</p> <p>Rather than despairing of the \"high\" culture he sees as having failed Europe, Steiner puts urgent faith in its transmission. As Jardine says: \"He belongs to that generation of Jewish immigrants who were raised in the Germanic system of values, and had to fight their way to thinking there were any values left, and to reinvesting in those that had let them down.\"</p> <p>The paradox remains as to why someone who doubts the capacity of the humanities to humanise has devoted half a century to their interpretation. \"I do question <br>their ability to make us more compassionate or more humane. Many of the achievements without which I would not have wanted to be alive were by men of inhuman cruelty and indifference,\" <br>says Steiner. </p> <p>He even suspects the humanities might have a dehumanising effect. \"If I have spent the day teaching King Lear or Bach, or in front of Goya, I come home and it may be that the cry in the street is muffled; that it reaches me less directly than if my feelings and responses had not been trained to a deeply passionate involvement with fictions - in the widest sense. </p> <p>\"If this is so, we must find a way of sharing aesthetic, philosophical experience which makes us more responsive to human pain, and <br>not less.\"<br>The same qualities that made Steiner mesmerising to many Cambridge students drew the suspicion and disdain of fellow dons. Jardine first heard of French existentialism in one of Steiner's lectures. \"People thought he was showing off,\" she says. \"Oxbridge was ruthlessly parochial in the 60s. George was unbelievably charismatic at a time when Cambridge was an insular gentlemen's club; here was this firebrand with a foreign accent, of whom all our teachers disapproved.\" </p> <p>Though Steiner was offered a professorial salary, he was never made a full university professor with the right to examine. Some members of the English faculty questioned the relevance to the discipline of the concentration camps he constantly evoked. In Cheyette's view, Steiner was working against the grain: \"Britain, until recently, didn't think it had a relationship to the Holocaust; its mythology of the war was rooted in the Blitz, Dunkirk, the Battle of Britain\", whereas now the study of \"Holocaust literature\" is taken for granted. Steiner felt his rejection keenly, comparing his treatment to that of Leavis.</p> <p> While Byatt notes a \"combative prickliness\" in his personality, Jardine says he \"takes things intensely personally; he has a short fuse and can be irritable, but he's also warm, welcoming, expansive\". Although he had the option of leaving for professorships in the US, Steiner's father objected that Hitler, who said no one bearing their name would be left in Europe, would then have won. \"I'd do anything rather than face such contempt from my father,\" Steiner told his wife.</p> <p>Yet Malcolm Bowie, professor of French literature at Oxford and a fellow of All Souls, notes an ambivalence on Steiner's part: \"He wants to be in and he wants to be out. Being on the margins suits him; you can't be a prophetic voice in a comfortable, consensual <br>position in the heartlands.\"</p> <p>Cheyette contrasts Steiner with Isaiah Berlin, \"who was prepared to acculturate and become a member of the British establishment, and was rewarded. Steiner has always refused to play that game\".</p> <p>Some see Steiner's polemical style as honed in response to what Jardine calls the \"suffocating English provincialism\" of the 1960s and 70s. Christopher Bigsby, professor of American studies at the University of East Anglia, who chairs the British Council's Cambridge seminar at which Steiner speaks annually, says he neither condescends nor panders to his audience, but \"surfs the wave of anger\" that greets his provocations. Harriet Harvey-Wood, former literature director of the British Council, sees Steiner as a \"magnificent lecturer - prophetic and doom-laden\" who would \"turn up with half a page of scribbled notes, and never refer to them. His voice shifted register the moment he began, and he always left blood on the carpet.\" </p> <p>She recalls him telling a roomful of African and Asian academics that the third world could not afford the luxury of universities.<br>\"He can be outrageous, off the cuff, bigoted,\" says Jardine. \"He doesn't police himself in the way modern intellectuals have been taught to do.\"</p> <p>In 1974 Steiner became professor of English and comparative literature at the University of Geneva, where he remained, though in transit, for 20 years. \"I loved Geneva passionately,\" he says. \"I was teaching in four languages.\"<br>He had lived by Goethe's dictum that \"no monoglot truly knows his own language\", and in After Babel (1975) affirmed the multiplicity of human tongues as a blessing rather than a curse.</p> <p> \"Every <br>language is a world,\" he said, lamenting the engulfing of tongues by Anglo-American. \"Without translation we would inhabit parishes bordering on silence.\"<br>For Peter Bush, director of the British Centre for Literary Translation at the University of East Anglia, After Babel was a pioneering work which \"revealed all communication as a form of translation, and how central translation is to relations between cultures\". Its importance endures, he believes, not least given that \"the insularity and monolingualism of British <br>academic life outside language departments is still startling\".</p> <p>In Steiner's inaugural lecture as visiting professor of European comparative literature at Oxford in 1994, he saw the English Channel as widening. \"I live and work on both sides of the channel; Paris is a constant home,\" he says. \"When I first came, I believed Britain would want to go into Europe and multilingualism would come. I was wrong; my father was a better prognosticator than me. The continent now deeply distrusts this country; it knows Anglo-American power is most important to it.\"</p> <p>Jardine notes Steiner's \"passionate conviction that if you pay close attention to language, it can reveal to you the fundamental truths of civilisation. It's an old-fashioned philosophy but it contains its own kind of spirituality. It's very handy for atheists; a system of beliefs grounded in secular texts.\"</p> <p>Steiner published his first <br>fiction, Anno Domini, in 1964. The collected fiction of The Deeps of the Sea (1996) is a 400-page <br>volume, with a cast of outcasts and exiles. Best known, and most controversial, is The Portage to San Cristobal of AH (1981), a dialectical staging of a confrontation between Hitler, as a fugitive in the Amazon, and Nazi hunters, praised as a \"masterpiece\" by AS Byatt. The novella explored ideas on the deep roots of European anti-semitism from his critical work In Bluebeard's Castle (1971). Nazism, he suggested, was Europe's revenge on the Jews for inventing conscience.</p> <p>The novella was attacked for giving Hitler the last word. But Bowie sees Steiner's \"power of identification with compromised figures - Hitler, Heidegger, Ezra Pound\" as an unusual gift. Cheyette views Steiner's fiction as an exploratory space where he can think against himself, and contrasts its humility and openness with his \"increasingly closed and orthodox\" critical work. Central to it, Cheyette believes, is the survivor's \"terrible, masochistic envy about not being there - having missed the rendezvous with hell\".</p> <p>According to Cheyette, Steiner has held up the diaspora as an ideal: \"He's always had a non-Zionist view of Jewish history. He refuses to buy into Jewish <br>nationalism, and believes Jewish <br>creativity is essentially a diasporic condition.\" Steiner says: \"I've tried at personal and professional cost to warn against nationalism in Israel and the treatment of Palestinians; to say that because of what we are, there are things we can't do. The extremists spit in your face; others say, 'Shut up in your beautiful house in Cambridge.' \" </p> <p>He adds:\"I can deal with any human being who has a centre, a bottom line. My dead centre is the conviction that no cause on this planet can justify torture. It is only very recently that Israel's supreme court has banned all torture - at least formally. That which to most of my fellow Jews is unimaginable - giving up Israel - is not to me, if the price is torture.\"</p> <p>Steiner is often attacked as an elitist (\"To be part of an elite means loving passionately and not negotiating your passions. If that's elitism, I plead guilty\"). He believes \"very few human beings can understand a proposition of Kant or Spinoza, or a fugue by Bach - or care to\", and notes with resignation that \"the planetary language is football\". Warning of the erosion of language and literacy by mass <br>communication and mass <br>consumption, he questions whether there is something anti-democratic about great art: \"The great traditional 'high' cultures have disturbingly flourished under despotic and oligarchic sytems. Whether a truly populist, egalitarian society takes to the achievements of 'high' culture is an open question. But it would be idiotic to be like King Canute. The reality today is mass marketing, mass consumption, mass media. To lament that is an arrogant impudence.\"</p> <p>Yet in Errata, Steiner aches with a sense of \"doors unopened\" - to Russian, Hebrew or Islam - and truths grasped <br>too late in life, such as the self-<br>ironising, fragmentary, ephemeral modes of modernity. \"I wasn't in on the adventure of the truly modern,\" he reflects. \"In [classical] music I'm avant-garde, I collect hundreds of records. But with jazz, my ear stopped with Dizzy Gillespie and Thelonious Monk, which I love. I'm no good at urinated beds in the Tate gallery, or sperm on the wall. I didn't understand that today Shakespeare would be writing transcendental screenplays. It's a big failure; I missed something.\" </p> <p>Yet he remains trenchantly sceptical: \"Why do even great films lose their greatness? Casablanca and Les Enfants du Paradis are dead after you've seen them five or 10 times. Until we have an answer to that, the jury's out.\"<br>For Jardine, Steiner is \"the master of high culture; never mind that he's not master of Ally McBeal. Those of us who have an investment in popular culture wouldn't have got there without him.\" </p> <p>But he has other blind spots. Although familiar with Derek Walcott's poetry - no doubt for its Homeric echoes - he assumes, rather than argues for, the supremacy of the western canon.

      "bodyText": "When the Parisian-born George Steiner went to Chicago University after the second world war, he found himself sharing a room with an ex-paratrooper, who stared in disbelief at \"a creature so obviously cosseted, sheltered, formally decked out, book-laden, as I was\", Steiner recalled. It was as though a quaint figure from a rarefied age of central European humanism, now all but vanquished by Nazism and war, had come face to face with the ascendant era of transatlantic mass culture, embodied by the war veterans swelling American campuses under the GI bill. Yet the budding critic, who was to become famous as an impassioned proselytiser for European \"high\" culture, was in awe of his room-mate. He compared the paratrooper's crouching leap on to a top bunk - a feat the diminutive \"bookworm and privileged mandarin Jew\" could never hope to match - to the transfixing grace of a Nureyev. Steiner has remained a paradoxical and contentious figure. A polyglot and polymath, he is often credited with recasting the role of the critic by exploring art and thought unbounded by national frontiers or academic disciplines. Though he distrusts the \"self-serving jargon\" of critical theory, his books, beginning with Tolstoy or Dostoevsky (1958) and The Death of Tragedy (1960), have posed philosophical questions about the humanities and their relationship to 20th-century history, most centrally about language and its debasement in the post-Holocaust age. He commends the \"autism\" of the scholar and claims to despise the mass media, yet has had a prominent voice in journalism, as a critic for the New Yorker, the Times Literary Supplement and the Observer. While Steiner sits more easily in a French intellectual tradition (and was last month given the French order of arts and letters), he came to Britain in the early 1950s, where his questioning presaged new fields years before comparative literature, or studies of translation or the Holocaust were established. The novelist AS Byatt admires Steiner as a \"late, late, late Renaissance man... a European metaphysician with an instinct for the driving ideas of our time\". Lisa Jardine, professor of Renaissance studies at Queen Mary college, University of London, recalls \"a rebel who made us aspire to being Europeans; he helped move British culture from utter provincialism to cosmopolitanism, and taught us to listen to language - how language carries the thread of morality and philosophy.\" Steiner's new book, Grammars of Creation, based on his 1990 Gifford lectures, is out next week. With a characteristically broad sweep, it questions the nature of creativity in an age of atheism - a line of inquiry the author believes is \"still almost a taboo\". It is also certain to find detractors. AC Grayling in the Literary Review dismisses the book as \"pretentious intellectual bombast\" written in a \"writhingly Latinate\" style. The familiar criticisms include: verbosity, stating the obvious, name-dropping, hyperbole, misquotation, obscurantism and a self-dramatising taste for the apocalyptic. Even friends acknowledge that Steiner's immense range comes at the price of inaccuracy. While he admits making errors, critics accuse him of complacency. According to Jay Keyser, professor emeritus of linguistics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Steiner was told at a seminar in the 1970s that, while he had written at length on Dostoevsky's use of the definite article, there was no such thing in Russian. \"It was as though a fly had landed on his shoulder,\" says Keyser. \"A criticism that should have been devastating made no impact.\" Unrepentant, Steiner continues to advocate generalisation over specialisation. His Bronowsky lecture in London earlier this month insisted that the notion of what it is to be literate must encompass knowledge of both arts and sciences, bridging CP Snow's \"two cultures\" divide. Its title, borrowed from Bottom in Midsummer Night's Dream, was Master, Spread Yourself. Steiner lives in Cambridge, where he has been extraordinary fellow at Churchill College since 1969. His wife, Zara, an authority on international relations, is a former vice-president of New Hall. Their son, David, and daughter, Deborah, are both academics in the US. While he is known as deeply serious, he reveals a deadpan humour. Once asked if he had ever read anything frivolous as a child, he replied: \"Moby Dick.\" He has said that the critic casts a eunuch's shadow: \"Who would be a critic if he could be a writer?\" Today, quoting Pushkin's \"savagely arrogant but irrefutable statement that he writes the letters and we carry them\", he calls himself a \"mail man\". But throughout his career, Steiner has delivered, with a sense of urgency, a message of his own, rooted in his view of the Holocaust (he prefers the term Shoah) as the defining catastrophe of our age. He was born in 1929 in Paris, to Viennese parents who had left the \"cradle of Nazism\" five years before. He describes his father, a Bohemian \"within reach of the ghetto\" who became a senior lawyer in the Austrian Central Bank, as \"formidable in his insight: he saved us from Hitler and was clear-sighted in a way that broke his heart\". Though dismissed by more sanguine Viennese Jews as a \"tedious Cassandra\", Steiner's father \"thought deeply about politics, and saw Nazism was an Austrian, not a German phenomenon - he could smell it in the air. He thought Jews were endangered guests wherever they went, and wanted to equip his children - my elder sister and myself - with languages to earn a living, the ability to pack a suitcase rather than a steamer trunk, and take joy in the adventure. If he transmitted one thing to me, it was how lucky I am to be under pressure.\" Steiner's mother, who lamented the \"irrational\" move from Vienna, was also formidable. \"I was severely handicapped,\" says Steiner, who was born with a withered right arm. \"Due to Maman, I overcame it. She was a Viennese grande dame, radiant, multilingual, wonderfully ironic. For her, self-pity was nauseating.\" Becoming left-handed was not an option. \"From her came the conviction that if it's difficult, it must be fun and worth doing. Today the rule of benevolent therapy is to buy shoes with zippers. I could have had them. It took 10 months for me to learn to tie a lace; I must have howled with rage and frustration. But one day I could tie my laces. That no one can take from you. I profoundly distrust the pedagogy of ease.\" Steiner's mother was apt to \"begin a sentence in one language and end it in another\", and he grew up with \"three mother tongues\" - French, German and English. He was reading Shakespeare in English and Homer in ancient Greek by the age of five. His father, who took him to museums every Saturday, taught him \"worship of the classic\". \"My father loved poetry and music. But deep in himself he thought teaching the finest thing a person could do,\" says Steiner. \"I learned early on that 'rabbi' means teacher, not priest.\" His father was also, Steiner recalls, a man of stern principle, \"whatever the price\". Working in Paris for an American investment bank, he was summoned to base in 1937 but refused to take the only liner leaving Cherbourg because it was flying the German flag. It cost him his job. \"History was always in attendance,\" Steiner wrote in Errata: An Examined Life (1997), his brief and curiously reticent memoir. So, it seems, was luck. In 1940 the family went on a trip to New York, where Steiner's father insisted they remain. Within a month, the Nazis had occupied Paris. Of the many Jewish pupils in Steiner's lyc\u008ee class in the affluent 16th arrondissement, he was one of only two who survived. He spent the war years at the French lyc\u008ee in Manhattan, and became a US citizen in 1944. As \"a kind of survivor\" - the title of a 1965 autobiographical essay - Steiner feels not the guilt of those who emerged from the camps, but bafflement. \"Why me? Why did I deserve to get away?\" Part of the legacy was a sense of obligation. \"My whole life has been about death, remembering and the Holocaust,\" he says. \"Namelessness was Hitler's taunt - 'Who remembers the Armenians?' I've had to be a 'remembrancer'.\" He became a \"grateful wanderer\" (\"Trees have roots and I have legs; I owe my life to that\"). Following a spell at the Sorbonne after the war, he preferred Chicago University to Yale, where Jews were \"consigned to a ghetto of pinched politeness\". It was as an undergraduate in Chicago that he found his vocation, unlocking the mysteries of learning for GIs in exchange for instruction in more earthly pleasures. His paratrooper room-mate, Alfie, took him to to hear Dizzy Gillespie, taught him poker - which he later abandoned for chess - and procured a prostitute for him at 19. \"He made my passage into adulthood caring, gentle and funny - free from neurosis,\" Steiner recalls. After Harvard, Steiner went as a Rhodes scholar to Balliol College, Oxford. But when his DPhil thesis - a draft for The Death of Tragedy - was initially refused, he worked for the Economist as a leader writer from 1952-56. He met Zara Shakow, a New Yorker of Lithuanian descent, in London at the instigation of mutual friends, who laid bets on their getting married - which they did in 1955. After two years at Princeton, Steiner became a founding fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, in 1961. The essays of Language and Silence (1967) set out lifelong themes, which echo in his more recent collection, No Passion Spent (1996). As the author wrote, \"They took their substance and much of their 'voice' from the legacy of Ernst Bloch, of [Theodor] Adorno, of Walter Benjamin and from the inheritance of Jewish poetic-philosophic investigations of the word. The mapping of my identity, the inward orientations, remain those circumscribed by Leningrad, Odessa, Prague and Vienna on the one side, and by Frankfurt, Milan and Paris on the other.\" For the Irish novelist and critic John Banville, it was an electrifying moment: \"A door was flung open on what had been there all the time, at our backs, namely, our European heritage. He told us not to be cowed by insularity or hidebound by small minds, but to look beyond the border.\" According to Bryan Cheyette, professor of 20th-century literature at Southampton university, Steiner was \"the first telling those who would listen in Britain about Heidegger, Benjamin and Paul Celan - the great German philosophers and poets. Now work on those figures is an industry, but he was a lone voice in the 60s.\" In Steiner's view, totalitarianism and the slaughters of 1914-45 had destroyed the assumption that literary culture is a custodian of humane values - self-evident to such figures as Dr Johnson, Coleridge, Matthew Arnold and FR Leavis. \"Some of the men who devised and administered Auschwitz had been trained to read Shakespeare and Goethe,\" he wrote, suggesting \"the paradox that modern barbarism sprang in some intuitive, perhaps necessary way, from the very core and locale of humanistic civilisation\". Partly inspired by Orwell, Steiner's 1959 essay The Hollow Miracle saw the German language itself as complicit in Nazism. He warned that language has a \"breaking point\", lies and sadism settling \"into the marrow\". As Adorno had said, \"No poetry after Auschwitz\", Steiner asked if the only response was a retreat into silence. Yet he took heart in such writers as Paul Celan and G\u009fnter Grass, assaulting postwar amnesia to confront the unspeakable, and so revealing the unexpected resilience of language. Rather than despairing of the \"high\" culture he sees as having failed Europe, Steiner puts urgent faith in its transmission. As Jardine says: \"He belongs to that generation of Jewish immigrants who were raised in the Germanic system of values, and had to fight their way to thinking there were any values left, and to reinvesting in those that had let them down.\" The paradox remains as to why someone who doubts the capacity of the humanities to humanise has devoted half a century to their interpretation. \"I do question their ability to make us more compassionate or more humane. Many of the achievements without which I would not have wanted to be alive were by men of inhuman cruelty and indifference,\" says Steiner. He even suspects the humanities might have a dehumanising effect. \"If I have spent the day teaching King Lear or Bach, or in front of Goya, I come home and it may be that the cry in the street is muffled; that it reaches me less directly than if my feelings and responses had not been trained to a deeply passionate involvement with fictions - in the widest sense. \"If this is so, we must find a way of sharing aesthetic, philosophical experience which makes us more responsive to human pain, and not less.\" The same qualities that made Steiner mesmerising to many Cambridge students drew the suspicion and disdain of fellow dons. Jardine first heard of French existentialism in one of Steiner's lectures. \"People thought he was showing off,\" she says. \"Oxbridge was ruthlessly parochial in the 60s. George was unbelievably charismatic at a time when Cambridge was an insular gentlemen's club; here was this firebrand with a foreign accent, of whom all our teachers disapproved.\" Though Steiner was offered a professorial salary, he was never made a full university professor with the right to examine. Some members of the English faculty questioned the relevance to the discipline of the concentration camps he constantly evoked. In Cheyette's view, Steiner was working against the grain: \"Britain, until recently, didn't think it had a relationship to the Holocaust; its mythology of the war was rooted in the Blitz, Dunkirk, the Battle of Britain\", whereas now the study of \"Holocaust literature\" is taken for granted. Steiner felt his rejection keenly, comparing his treatment to that of Leavis. While Byatt notes a \"combative prickliness\" in his personality, Jardine says he \"takes things intensely personally; he has a short fuse and can be irritable, but he's also warm, welcoming, expansive\". Although he had the option of leaving for professorships in the US, Steiner's father objected that Hitler, who said no one bearing their name would be left in Europe, would then have won. \"I'd do anything rather than face such contempt from my father,\" Steiner told his wife. Yet Malcolm Bowie, professor of French literature at Oxford and a fellow of All Souls, notes an ambivalence on Steiner's part: \"He wants to be in and he wants to be out. Being on the margins suits him; you can't be a prophetic voice in a comfortable, consensual position in the heartlands.\" Cheyette contrasts Steiner with Isaiah Berlin, \"who was prepared to acculturate and become a member of the British establishment, and was rewarded. Steiner has always refused to play that game\". Some see Steiner's polemical style as honed in response to what Jardine calls the \"suffocating English provincialism\" of the 1960s and 70s. Christopher Bigsby, professor of American studies at the University of East Anglia, who chairs the British Council's Cambridge seminar at which Steiner speaks annually, says he neither condescends nor panders to his audience, but \"surfs the wave of anger\" that greets his provocations. Harriet Harvey-Wood, former literature director of the British Council, sees Steiner as a \"magnificent lecturer - prophetic and doom-laden\" who would \"turn up with half a page of scribbled notes, and never refer to them. His voice shifted register the moment he began, and he always left blood on the carpet.\" She recalls him telling a roomful of African and Asian academics that the third world could not afford the luxury of universities. \"He can be outrageous, off the cuff, bigoted,\" says Jardine. \"He doesn't police himself in the way modern intellectuals have been taught to do.\" In 1974 Steiner became professor of English and comparative literature at the University of Geneva, where he remained, though in transit, for 20 years. \"I loved Geneva passionately,\" he says. \"I was teaching in four languages.\" He had lived by Goethe's dictum that \"no monoglot truly knows his own language\", and in After Babel (1975) affirmed the multiplicity of human tongues as a blessing rather than a curse. \"Every language is a world,\" he said, lamenting the engulfing of tongues by Anglo-American. \"Without translation we would inhabit parishes bordering on silence.\" For Peter Bush, director of the British Centre for Literary Translation at the University of East Anglia, After Babel was a pioneering work which \"revealed all communication as a form of translation, and how central translation is to relations between cultures\". Its importance endures, he believes, not least given that \"the insularity and monolingualism of British academic life outside language departments is still startling\". In Steiner's inaugural lecture as visiting professor of European comparative literature at Oxford in 1994, he saw the English Channel as widening. \"I live and work on both sides of the channel; Paris is a constant home,\" he says. \"When I first came, I believed Britain would want to go into Europe and multilingualism would come. I was wrong; my father was a better prognosticator than me. The continent now deeply distrusts this country; it knows Anglo-American power is most important to it.\" Jardine notes Steiner's \"passionate conviction that if you pay close attention to language, it can reveal to you the fundamental truths of civilisation. It's an old-fashioned philosophy but it contains its own kind of spirituality. It's very handy for atheists; a system of beliefs grounded in secular texts.\" Steiner published his first fiction, Anno Domini, in 1964. The collected fiction of The Deeps of the Sea (1996) is a 400-page volume, with a cast of outcasts and exiles. Best known, and most controversial, is The Portage to San Cristobal of AH (1981), a dialectical staging of a confrontation between Hitler, as a fugitive in the Amazon, and Nazi hunters, praised as a \"masterpiece\" by AS Byatt. The novella explored ideas on the deep roots of European anti-semitism from his critical work In Bluebeard's Castle (1971). Nazism, he suggested, was Europe's revenge on the Jews for inventing conscience. The novella was attacked for giving Hitler the last word. But Bowie sees Steiner's \"power of identification with compromised figures - Hitler, Heidegger, Ezra Pound\" as an unusual gift. Cheyette views Steiner's fiction as an exploratory space where he can think against himself, and contrasts its humility and openness with his \"increasingly closed and orthodox\" critical work. Central to it, Cheyette believes, is the survivor's \"terrible, masochistic envy about not being there - having missed the rendezvous with hell\". According to Cheyette, Steiner has held up the diaspora as an ideal: \"He's always had a non-Zionist view of Jewish history. He refuses to buy into Jewish nationalism, and believes Jewish creativity is essentially a diasporic condition.\" Steiner says: \"I've tried at personal and professional cost to warn against nationalism in Israel and the treatment of Palestinians; to say that because of what we are, there are things we can't do. The extremists spit in your face; others say, 'Shut up in your beautiful house in Cambridge.' \" He adds:\"I can deal with any human being who has a centre, a bottom line. My dead centre is the conviction that no cause on this planet can justify torture. It is only very recently that Israel's supreme court has banned all torture - at least formally. That which to most of my fellow Jews is unimaginable - giving up Israel - is not to me, if the price is torture.\" Steiner is often attacked as an elitist (\"To be part of an elite means loving passionately and not negotiating your passions. If that's elitism, I plead guilty\"). He believes \"very few human beings can understand a proposition of Kant or Spinoza, or a fugue by Bach - or care to\", and notes with resignation that \"the planetary language is football\". Warning of the erosion of language and literacy by mass communication and mass consumption, he questions whether there is something anti-democratic about great art: \"The great traditional 'high' cultures have disturbingly flourished under despotic and oligarchic sytems. Whether a truly populist, egalitarian society takes to the achievements of 'high' culture is an open question. But it would be idiotic to be like King Canute. The reality today is mass marketing, mass consumption, mass media. To lament that is an arrogant impudence.\" Yet in Errata, Steiner aches with a sense of \"doors unopened\" - to Russian, Hebrew or Islam - and truths grasped too late in life, such as the self- ironising, fragmentary, ephemeral modes of modernity. \"I wasn't in on the adventure of the truly modern,\" he reflects. \"In [classical] music I'm avant-garde, I collect hundreds of records. But with jazz, my ear stopped with Dizzy Gillespie and Thelonious Monk, which I love. I'm no good at urinated beds in the Tate gallery, or sperm on the wall. I didn't understand that today Shakespeare would be writing transcendental screenplays. It's a big failure; I missed something.\" Yet he remains trenchantly sceptical: \"Why do even great films lose their greatness? Casablanca and Les Enfants du Paradis are dead after you've seen them five or 10 times. Until we have an answer to that, the jury's out.\" For Jardine, Steiner is \"the master of high culture; never mind that he's not master of Ally McBeal. Those of us who have an investment in popular culture wouldn't have got there without him.\" But he has other blind spots. Although familiar with Derek Walcott's poetry - no doubt for its Homeric echoes - he assumes, rather than argues for, the supremacy of the western canon. As he wrote in Errata: \"Why should there not be a Caribbean Proust, a Beethoven out of Africa? But do we honestly believe in this advent?\" While some applaud what they see as Steiner's drive to widen English horizons, for others his European perspective has its own limits. \"It's a deeply tragic vision that touches on the dark side of the European enlightenment, and sees anti-semitism arising from within the very greatness he's celebrating,\" says Stuart Hall, emeritus professor of the Open University and a founder of cultural studies. \"But you have to have assumed that European high culture was the culmination of humanity to have been so profoundly shocked, even destroyed, by that darkness; because if you took a sighting of Europe from outside, the story would be one of expansion and colonisation over centuries. You don't see that if you dwell within the limits of Greek poetry and Renaissance art.\" Now 71 and retired, Steiner will be Norton visiting professor at Harvard in the next academic year, and notes with satisfaction that his picture hangs in the National Portrait Gallery and that he has three honorary fellowships from Oxford and Cambridge. \"It could have come earlier - when I wasn't senile and losing my hearing - and the commuting life put a strain on my wife. But I've been so lucky.\" Yet he still says of Britain: \"I'll never be accepted here completely. The things I talk about are not the things Britain thinks are important - though they're the daily substance of my conversations from Lisbon to St Petersburg.\" But he finds consolation in the \"vocation\" of the guest: \"It's one of the obligations I feel towards Judaism; to show that being a guest and not rooted can be difficult, but we're all guests of life. It's wonderful to be a guest and leave the place you found better than when you found it.\" \u0095 Grammars of Creation is published by Faber (\u00a316.99). Books, page 9.

For more than six years airlines have been keeping hidden the fact that partial refunds are available. The money which should be handed back to you if you fail to make your flight is the air passen ger duty (APD) and the airport charges - which the airlines collect on behalf of the government, but which only have to be handed over if the passengers gets on the plane. Passengers have the right to have this money returned, even if it is sold as a 'non-refundable' ticket. In the case of low-cost flights the taxes and charges can make up as much as 80% of the ticket price, although the figure is usually lower. A return flight from London to Edinburgh on British Airways, for instance, costs \u00a373.20, of which \u00a323.20 is refundable. A BA spokeswoman says: \"We are making improvements in the way we communicate conditions of carriage from April. We are planning to change information we give out to staff at the point of sale.\" The company did not comment on whether retrospective claims would be honoured. The airlines, led by British Airways and Ryanair, only moved to admit the regulations after calls from the Air Transport Users' Council called for them to refund all the money due to passengers. Around 2% of EasyJet passengers cancel their flights each year, earning the airline \u00a31.2m in APD. A spokeswoman from Tesco Financial Services says: \"If this results in reduced claims, then we would pass this on in lower premiums for customers. \"We ask customers to claim back as much as they can and we pay the rest, so if they can claim more, then the policy will cost less.\" But Mark Shaw, partner with Direct Travel says that the insurers already reclaim the tax from the airlines themselves, so this has already been factored into the policy rates. He adds that on average 30% of the value of all claims are for cancellations, although this does not just cover the cost of the flight. Air passenger duty, which was introduced in 1994, is set to change next month, halving on European flights, but doubling on business long-haul trips. APD on domestic flights will remain at \u00a310.",

This preoccupation with themes of loss and the phantom traces of the past finds its most potent expression in \"The Cats\", a droll, eerie comedy of bereavement and inherited mess. Here an urbane college professor returns to the dilapidated family farm to find the place haunted by the starving, semi-feral strays his mother used to feed.

An extended coda to Updike's classic quartet of novels, it alights in familiar, fictionalised Brewer, Pennsylvania, on the cusp of the new millennium. Angstrom has been dead for a decade - his heart giving out at the end of 1990's Rabbit at Rest - yet the spillover from his turbulent life and times continues to make mischief for his son Nelson and widow Janice (now contentedly remarried to the boorish Ronnie Harrison). Harry's oblique reappearance comes in the form of his illegitimate daughter Annabelle, the result of a brief affair documented way back in 1960's Rabbit, Run . For Janice, this unwelcome visitor is \"his emissary from beyond the grave\" and a physical lookalike in a way that slight, dark-haired Nelson never was. \"A whiff of Harry, a pale glow, a certain drift comes off this girl, this 39-year-old piece of evidence.\"</p> <p>Taken as a whole, the Rabbit novels positioned Angstrom as a kind of feet-of-clay emblem for America itself: at first brimming with promise and a rude, restless energy, then sliding towards a frustrated fat-cat middle age. Rabbit Remembered, by contrast, regards him as a poltergeist in need of exorcism. Undeniably, Angstrom's death left behind a swirl of narrative disarray - two tattered marriages, a belly-up business, the hint of an illegitimate child - while Rabbit's supporting cast are certainly strong enough to merit a return visit, having been fleshed out and refined over the course of the four preceding novels. The trouble is that in tidying up these loose ends, Updike mounts too schematic a clean-up job. He seizes his scattered, shattered Angstroms and bullies them towards a final, frozen parody of picture-book domesticity.</p> <p>As such, Rabbit Remembered feels false: its tone jars against the tumble that went before.

It would have made for a more real and a more Rabbitesque swansong if he had.</p> <p>In terms of world renown, Updike arguably hit his pinnacle with the publication of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Rabbit at Rest . The intervening decade has largely caught him napping, churning out a few minor-key novels ( Memories of the Ford Administration , In the Beauty of the Lilies ) and the occasional misconceived folly (Gertrude and Claudius ). With Licks of Love he appears to be beating back into the past. His short stories are ruminative reminiscences, while the novella tends to the grave of his most famous creation. In terms of technique, this curious, twofold creation can't be faulted. Updike still writes with his usual easy grace, demonstrating his casual mastery at piloting a narrative. But the whole thing is coloured by a strange lack of rigour and ambition. In Licks of Love, the author does not so much create as repeat and reclaim.

      "body": "<p>\"Having visions,\" agreed Rob from Anti-Racist Action. </p> <p>\"The nutcase stuff,\" said Sam. \"Do we want to hang him on that?\" </p> <p>But the others argued forcibly that the coalition should avoid these areas. \"We're not here to do a psychological analysis on him,\" said a woman called Julia. \"Just leave it. Let's leave it.\" </p> <p>When three representatives of the coalition appeared on a radio phone-in show to drum up support for a mass protest against David Icke, they received a volley of antagonistic questions. Why were they obsessed with denying freedom of speech to someone who clearly wasn't an anti-Semite? Who was really behind the coalition? What were they hiding? And so on. </p> <p>The coalition hastily convened a meeting at a downtown coffee bar to discuss new tactics. Sam suggested producing a press release announcing that David Icke was suffering from some form of mental illness. \"To me, he sounds schizophrenic,\" he said. \"Hearing voices.\"</p> <p>But as the evening wore on, the gathering began to seem more like a postmortem than a strategy meeting. A young activist called Ali said that she felt she had pinpointed the coalition's tactical error: they had made young people feel stupid. \"Young people are seeing this big task before them,\" explained Ali, \"trying to combat economic global corporatisation. And a lot of them have read David Icke and thought, 'Hey! He's on our side. I'm looking for answers and he seems to have them.' And we've made them feel stupid, like they've done something bad by getting sucked in.\" Ali paused. \"And now they\u00cdre saying to us, 'Don't tell me I\u00cdm stupid!\u00cd What we should have said to them was, \u00efYou\u00cdre not stupid. We understand why you thought he was okay.'But we didn't. And now they think we think they\u00cdre stupid.\"</p> <p>The next morning, the Canadian Jewish Congress and B'nai Brith - the most powerful and respected groups within the anti-racist alliance - cut their losses. They telephoned Sam to say they were withdrawing their support from the coalition. This was a tremendous blow. Now, the only people left battling Icke were Sam and his young friends from Anti-Racist Action. On Friday night, these tatters of the opposition met at the Havana Bar on Commercial Drive. It was a melancholy occasion.</p> <p>\"I guess it's over,\" I said.</p> <p>There was a silence.</p> <p>\"No!\" said Michael. \"It isn't over.\"</p> <p>Michael is young and handsome. He had been pepper-sprayed in Seattle and trampled by Mounties in Vancouver. You could still smell the pepper spray on his bandana. \"Thousands and thousands of people,\" said Michael, \"went down to Seattle, risked their lives to try and address the problems created by the evolution of global capitalism, and now this pompous wingnut, this buffoon has flounced into town . . .\"</p> <p>Michael didn't need to finish his sentence. We knew. David Icke had flounced into town with his lizard thesis on the dangers of international capitalism, and he was cleaning up, winning the hearts of those Michael himself had hoped to convert by serious debate about global economics, swiftly followed by some kind of direct action. Rational thought was being vanquished, and the lizards were winning. \"He can discredit the whole movement,\" said Michael. \"I can see the World Trade Organisation saying, 'If you oppose us, you\u00cdre just scared of some . . . some . . . lizard conspiracy.' And that's the most scary thing to me.\"</p> <p>I think that, in David Icke, Michael was seeing an omen of the blackest kind. He was seeing the future of thought itself: a time when irrational thought would sweep the land, much as racism had done the previous century, when Washington DC was a blaze of white, the white of a million Ku-Klux Klansmen marching past a Klan-friendly White House and a Klan-friendly Capitol Hill.</p> <p>Then Michael said, \"This ridiculous guru has blinded the people of Vancouver, and there's only one thing for it.\"</p> <p>\"Which is what?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"Icke needs his pomposity pricked in public,\" said Michael. \"He needs to be humiliated, disgraced, he needs to become a laughing stock. Only then will his followers see him for what he is - a self-important, humourless clown.\"</p> <p>And, as we sat on the terrace of the Havana Bar, Michael understood how he could make that happen. </p> <p>It was Saturday morning at Michael's house. Michael and Sam and a few of their friends were making the final preparations for today's physical assault on David Icke.</p> <p>\"Are you nervous?\" I asked them. </p> <p>\"I'm getting butterflies,\" said a woman called Linda. \"It's exciting. I just hope no militia wingnut acts in a hostile way.\"</p> <p>\"Oh, it'll be just new-age flakes there,\" said Michael.</p> <p>\"No it won't,\" said Linda. \"Just look at Mr Militiaman who turned up at the meeting last week. He was dangerous.\"</p> <p>\"The point is,\" agreed Tony, \"if someone is unstable enough to believe that lizards run the world, God knows what they might do to us.\"</p> <p>The plan was this: at 2pm, David Icke was scheduled to make a personal appearance at Granville Books in the centre of town. </p> <p>Sam and Linda would arrive first to create a distraction.</p> <p>\"Some chanting,\" said Sam.</p> <p>\"Any kind of confusion,\" said Michael. \"And then I\u00cdll just run in, get to the front of the queue, and smack the meringue pie right into Icke\u00cds face!\"</p> <p>\"Excellent!\" said Sam.</p> <p>\"A flaky pie for a flaky guy!\" said Michael.</p> <p>The anti-racists envisaged a devastating result. The mask would slip the moment Icke's face was publicly splattered with meringue. His self-importance would blow up into the most hilarious tantrum, and he would be seen for the pompous fool he was.</p> <p>\"We're going to ridicule the idiot,\" said Michael. \"Are we ready, my fellow les entartiers? Let's go . . .\"</p> <p>At 1pm David Icke and I walked the three blocks from the Rosedale Hotel to Granville Books. I was feeling terrible about my passive role in the impending pie attack. I believed that Michael was correct in his analysis of how David would respond to this public humiliation. But I had decided to remain an impartial observer, and so I gave him no clue as to what was about to happen. David was in high spirits. He started reminiscing about the events of the early 90s, the bad days that followed his appearance on the Wogan show. \"You know,\" he said, \"one of my very greatest fears as a child was being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People come up to you in the street and shake your hand and talk to you in a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into 'Icke's a nutter'. I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule.\"</p> <p>David carried on walking and talking. \"You have to keep walking and talking,\" he said. In the aftermath of the Wogan show, David told me, he had exiled himself from Britain. He took to travelling in the US and South Africa - countries that knew nothing about his predictions of cataclysmic flooding. Their failure to materialise had damaged his credibility in Britain even further. Nonetheless, he began to blame the media for the ridicule he suffered at the hands of the general public.</p> <p>\"Yes, I said some pretty astonishing things back then,\" he explained, \"but the media still managed to massively exaggerate them. And what I realised, with all the laughter and all the ridicule, was just how easy it is to get vast numbers of people to believe anything. You just have to print it in enough newspapers. So I started to look into who was in a position to orchestrate this kind of global manipulation. And that's how I learnt about the Bilderberg Group.\"</p> <p>David became an avid reader of Big Jim Tucker and his magazine, the Spotlight. Blaming the global elitists, in part, for scheming the assault against him in the British media, he researched and wrote two books about the spider\u00cds web of secret societies that controlled the planet. He wrote that the global elite are hopelessly drawn to strange rituals, that they run around in robes and burn giant wicker owls at a secret summer camp called Bohemian Grove in the forests north of San Francisco. Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller are rumoured to be among the berobed. </p> <p> David came to believe that the global elite were not just stealthily influencing free-trade legislation so as to ease the way for complete global domination; they also operated, out of the White House, a harem of kidnapped and hypnotised underage sex slaves.</p> <p>Shocked by his findings, he looked to ancient times, hoping to find some validating evidence. He discovered primitive cultures that had carved effigies of lizard-men descending from the skies. He put two and two together. This was the key. The reptilian invaders were the secret rulers of the world. Now he was ready to publish.</p> <p>It was a hit. His career went into turn around. He was invited to speak all over the world. \"And, you see,\" said David, \"it all turned out all right. Now my children can hold up their heads and say, 'That's my dad. You laughed at him. But look at him now.'\" Granville Books was packed with fans and TV crews and journalists. \"Nobody's going to travel miles and hours just to come and see an anti-Semitic madman,\" suggested a fan to me. \"Whatever Mr David Icke has to say is more than fascinating.\"</p> <p>David's entrance was greeted with whoops and applause. \"You are one of the great thinkers of truth!\" yelled a lady from the back.</p> <p>\"Hooray!\" responded the crowd.</p> <p>\"Thank you,\" said David. \"Once we free our souls, the hierarchies of all religions, the Muslim hierarchy, the Jewish hierarchy - I call them 'OppoSames' - can't touch us.\" This statement was greeted with cheers and spontaneous applause, and autographs were signed. </p> <p>It was 30 minutes later that Sam and Linda entered the shop to create their distraction. They noisily elbowed their way into the middle of the crowd.</p> <p>\"Tell us why you're against Jews!\" yelled Sam, the television cameras now on him. \"Tell us about the Protocols of Zion.\"</p> <p>\"Don't care!\" screamed the supporters. \"Don't care! Get out of here!\"</p> <p>Two old ladies grabbed Sam and pushed him - with unexpected savagery - against a display of new-age literature.</p> <p>\"Out!\" they chanted with ferocity. \"Out! Out! Out! You're not welcome! Get out!\" Michael slipped into the shop. His face was hidden by a scarf, his pie buried beneath his trenchcoat.

But then, miraculously, a gap appeared, a window of opportunity. Michael opened his coat, retrieved his pie, and took aim. The meringue pie flew through the air.

It splattered, with a devastating thud, all over the children\u00cds book section. </p> <p>\"Well,\" murmured David, brushing the pastry flakes from his jacket, \"that massively backfired.\"</p> <p>\"We're just booksellers,'\" said the store manager softly. \"You're wrecking the store.\"</p> <p>\"Shame,\" said some old ladies. There were sad tuts of disapproval.</p> <p>The manager produced a sponge and began gently to clean the children's books. \"Please leave,\" he said.</p> <p>And, as the anti-racists slipped quietly away, a few members of David's entourage grinned behind their hands.

      "bodyText": "\"Having visions,\" agreed Rob from Anti-Racist Action. \"The nutcase stuff,\" said Sam. \"Do we want to hang him on that?\" But the others argued forcibly that the coalition should avoid these areas. \"We're not here to do a psychological analysis on him,\" said a woman called Julia. \"Just leave it. Let's leave it.\" When three representatives of the coalition appeared on a radio phone-in show to drum up support for a mass protest against David Icke, they received a volley of antagonistic questions. Why were they obsessed with denying freedom of speech to someone who clearly wasn't an anti-Semite? Who was really behind the coalition? What were they hiding? And so on. The coalition hastily convened a meeting at a downtown coffee bar to discuss new tactics. Sam suggested producing a press release announcing that David Icke was suffering from some form of mental illness. \"To me, he sounds schizophrenic,\" he said. \"Hearing voices.\" But as the evening wore on, the gathering began to seem more like a postmortem than a strategy meeting. A young activist called Ali said that she felt she had pinpointed the coalition's tactical error: they had made young people feel stupid. \"Young people are seeing this big task before them,\" explained Ali, \"trying to combat economic global corporatisation. And a lot of them have read David Icke and thought, 'Hey! He's on our side. I'm looking for answers and he seems to have them.' And we've made them feel stupid, like they've done something bad by getting sucked in.\" Ali paused. \"And now they\u00cdre saying to us, 'Don't tell me I\u00cdm stupid!\u00cd What we should have said to them was, \u00efYou\u00cdre not stupid. We understand why you thought he was okay.'But we didn't. And now they think we think they\u00cdre stupid.\" The next morning, the Canadian Jewish Congress and B'nai Brith - the most powerful and respected groups within the anti-racist alliance - cut their losses. They telephoned Sam to say they were withdrawing their support from the coalition. This was a tremendous blow. Now, the only people left battling Icke were Sam and his young friends from Anti-Racist Action. On Friday night, these tatters of the opposition met at the Havana Bar on Commercial Drive. It was a melancholy occasion. \"I guess it's over,\" I said. There was a silence. \"No!\" said Michael. \"It isn't over.\" Michael is young and handsome. He had been pepper-sprayed in Seattle and trampled by Mounties in Vancouver. You could still smell the pepper spray on his bandana. \"Thousands and thousands of people,\" said Michael, \"went down to Seattle, risked their lives to try and address the problems created by the evolution of global capitalism, and now this pompous wingnut, this buffoon has flounced into town . . .\" Michael didn't need to finish his sentence. We knew. David Icke had flounced into town with his lizard thesis on the dangers of international capitalism, and he was cleaning up, winning the hearts of those Michael himself had hoped to convert by serious debate about global economics, swiftly followed by some kind of direct action. Rational thought was being vanquished, and the lizards were winning. \"He can discredit the whole movement,\" said Michael. \"I can see the World Trade Organisation saying, 'If you oppose us, you\u00cdre just scared of some . . . some . . . lizard conspiracy.' And that's the most scary thing to me.\" I think that, in David Icke, Michael was seeing an omen of the blackest kind. He was seeing the future of thought itself: a time when irrational thought would sweep the land, much as racism had done the previous century, when Washington DC was a blaze of white, the white of a million Ku-Klux Klansmen marching past a Klan-friendly White House and a Klan-friendly Capitol Hill. Then Michael said, \"This ridiculous guru has blinded the people of Vancouver, and there's only one thing for it.\" \"Which is what?\" I asked. \"Icke needs his pomposity pricked in public,\" said Michael. \"He needs to be humiliated, disgraced, he needs to become a laughing stock. Only then will his followers see him for what he is - a self-important, humourless clown.\" And, as we sat on the terrace of the Havana Bar, Michael understood how he could make that happen. It was Saturday morning at Michael's house. Michael and Sam and a few of their friends were making the final preparations for today's physical assault on David Icke. \"Are you nervous?\" I asked them. \"I'm getting butterflies,\" said a woman called Linda. \"It's exciting. I just hope no militia wingnut acts in a hostile way.\" \"Oh, it'll be just new-age flakes there,\" said Michael. \"No it won't,\" said Linda. \"Just look at Mr Militiaman who turned up at the meeting last week. He was dangerous.\" \"The point is,\" agreed Tony, \"if someone is unstable enough to believe that lizards run the world, God knows what they might do to us.\" The plan was this: at 2pm, David Icke was scheduled to make a personal appearance at Granville Books in the centre of town. Sam and Linda would arrive first to create a distraction. \"Some chanting,\" said Sam. \"Any kind of confusion,\" said Michael. \"And then I\u00cdll just run in, get to the front of the queue, and smack the meringue pie right into Icke\u00cds face!\" \"Excellent!\" said Sam. \"A flaky pie for a flaky guy!\" said Michael. The anti-racists envisaged a devastating result. The mask would slip the moment Icke's face was publicly splattered with meringue. His self-importance would blow up into the most hilarious tantrum, and he would be seen for the pompous fool he was. \"We're going to ridicule the idiot,\" said Michael. \"Are we ready, my fellow les entartiers?

      "body": "<p>In a meeting room in a community centre in Vancouver, the blackboard said \"Strategy\" and the leaflets said \"Bigot Alert\". A coalition of prominent anti-racist organisations shook hands and took their seats, notepads at the ready. A \"leading racist\" was about to land in Canada on a speaking tour. TV and radio stations were vying to secure chatshow bookings. There would be celebrity appearances, meet-and-greet-the-fans sessions and high-profile book signings. This was, the coalition felt, an unusual and disquieting turn of events. The media do not, as a rule, scramble to book racists for celebrity appearances. But this was an unusual racist, they said. </p> <p>\"Above all,\" began the chair of the meeting, \"David Icke represents a political threat. His writings are anti-Semitic. David Icke states that the global elite, the Illuminati who dominate every aspect of our lives, are genetically descended from an extraterrestrial race of reptiles who came to earth some time ago in the form of humans, who are capable of changing their shape, who engage in ritual child sacrifice, who drink blood . . .\" </p> <p>The coalition shook their heads wearily. In terms of code words, they had now heard it all. </p> <p>\"What is this crap, this metaphorically hidden language?\" asked a member of Anti-Racist Action, a visiting scientist from Somalia. \"Who is a lizard? It's bullshit. Bullshit! As a human being, you have to use proper language.\" </p> <p>\"What do these words imply?\" I asked him. </p> <p>\"What do you think they imply?\" he replied. \"Lizards? Reptiles? Cockroaches? Amphibians? They imply hatred. Racist hatred.\" </p> <p>\"Do you think that, when David Icke says lizards, he means Jews?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"Of course!\" he said. \"What is lizard? What is amphibian? It is a pile of rubbish. Why he's using those terminologies such as lizards? This vile language. Vile bullshit. I'm totally, culturally shocked.\" </p> <p>\"So,\" continued the chair, \"what are we going to do about this?\" </p> <p>Wheels had already been set in motion. The Canadian hate crimes unit had been alerted. So had the media. The coalition had also written to the former Canadian prime minister, Brian Mulroney, to inform him that David Icke was accusing him of being a reptilian, child-sacrificing paedophile. But so far, to the coalition's bafflement, Mulroney had declined to initiate legal action. Indeed, every individual accused of reptilian paedophilia by David Icke had so far failed to sue, including Bob Hope, George Bush, George Bush Jr, Ted Heath, the Rothschild family, Boxcar Willie, the Queen of England, the Queen Mother, Prince Philip, Kris Kristofferson, Al Gore and the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group. </p> <p>\"Why do you think that is?\" David Icke had asked me when I interviewed him about this matter in London. Then he turned to my notepad and thundered, \"Come on, Ted Heath! Sue me if you've got nothing to hide! Come on, George Bush! I'm ready! Sue me! I'm naming names! Come on, Jon? Why are they refusing to sue me?\" </p> <p>There was a silence. \"Because they are twelve-foot lizards?\" I suggested, smally. </p> <p>\"Yes!\" said David. \"Exactly!\" </p> <p>\"Keep in mind that this is not a meeting to debate what David Icke stands for,\" announced the chair back in Vancouver. \"This is a meeting for people who are opposed to David Icke's presence in the community. I would like to know if any people here consider themselves supporters of David Icke?\" </p> <p>There was a silence. \"I . . . uh . . . haven't made up my mind yet,\" said a man in a beige jacket whom nobody recognised. \"I don't know what David Icke stands for. I have been fighting Nazis for 20 years, but sometimes it is difficult to tell who the Nazis are.\" </p> <p>This man was unshaven. His blond hair was long and lank. Anti-racists shared quiet glances. Strictly speaking, this man had - by failing to have made up his mind - contravened the stated rule. This meeting was for people who had made up their minds. But the tacit consensus was not, at this stage, to demand his removal from the room. </p> <p>\"David Icke is opposed to community values,\" explained the chair patiently. \"The purpose of this meeting is to organise against David Icke. If that is not your purpose, you might want to reconsider whether this is a meeting you want to be at.\" </p> <p>A beat allowed this thought to linger, and then the subject was changed. \"He's clearly out to act as a conduit to the patriot movement,\" said Tony from the British Columbia Socialist Caucus, \"the far-right anti-Semitic racist militia movement.\" </p> <p>It was at this moment that the stranger in the beige jacket made a startling announcement. \"I have been in the militia movement of the United States for four years,\" he said, \"and I only ever met one racist there.\" </p> <p>The action that followed this declaration was swift. \"I think at this point it may be unproductive if you continue to remain in the room,\" said the chair. </p> <p>The militiaman looked shaken by this rapid response. \"If you . . . uh . . . want to rule me out, fine,\" he stammered, \"but I just wanted to see if I could do anything to help.\" </p> <p>\"I think that people are uncomfortable with you sitting at the meeting.\" </p> <p>\"I came to hear what David Icke was about and whether I could help,\" he said. \"Could I just ask two questions?\" </p> <p>\"But this isn't a debate,\" smiled the chair. </p> <p>\"Okay. Okay. I'll go. But could I just ask . . .\" </p> <p>\"Please, no.\" </p> <p>\"I'm gone,\" he said. \"I'm gone.\" Then he left. </p> <p>A break was called. In the car park, informal suggestions were thrown around over cigarettes by the younger and more rebellious activists. Someone offered to launch a physical attack on David Icke at his hotel. I suspected a giant misunderstanding was in danger of spiralling out of control. Knowing what I did about David Icke's past - specifically, his startling announcement on the Terry Wogan chatshow on BBC1 in 1991 that he was the Son of God - I guessed that when he said that 12ft lizards secretly ruled the world, he really was referring to lizards. But what did I know? The code words did seem to be increasingly abstruse. I elected to remain an impartial observer to the unfolding events in Vancouver in the hope that some clarity might develop in the days ahead. </p> <p>Wogan. The blue comedian Jim Davidson was top of the bill that night (this was primetime BBC1, in the autumn of 1991), but most of the viewers had tuned in to see Terry Wogan's first guest. There had been rumours in the tabloids all week that something unexpected had happened to David Icke, the popular BBC sports personality, once a professional football player, now the host of Grandstand and a household name. The tabloids said that David Icke had started wearing only turquoise, that he was predicting cataclysmic flooding and earthquakes - and that he was claiming to be the Son of God. </p> <p>I had watched a videotape of this broadcast before leaving London for Vancouver. It was startling to see how David Icke looked, how haggard and exhausted and terribly nervous - so unlike the genial BBC soccer and snooker correspondent whom the British public had come to feel so comfortable with - and dressed from head to toe in a turquoise shellsuit (turquoise being a conduit of positive energy) as he stepped out on to the stage. </p> <p>\"Why you?\" asked Wogan with an incredulity that reflected the mood of the land. \"Why have you been chosen?\" </p> <p>\"People would have said the same thing to Jesus,\" David Icke replied. \"Who the heck are you? You're a carpenter's son.\" </p> <p>\"When might we expect tidal waves, eruptions and earthquakes?\" asked Wogan. </p> <p>\"They will certainly happen this year,\" said David. </p> <p>This conversation took place amid howls of laughter from the studio audience. </p> <p>\"Why should we believe you?\" said Wogan. </p> <p>\"I'm saying that these things are going to happen this year,\" said David, \"so we'll see, won't we?\" </p> <p>\"And what will happen to you if they don't happen?\" asked Wogan. </p> <p>\"They will happen,\" said David. </p> <p>He said this with such ferocity, such conviction, that the audience stopped laughing for a moment. However wise and modern we are, this kind of thing can still shake us up. You could feel it sweep across the television studio, sweep across the land, a stirring of some primordial paranoia. Could David Icke actually be a soothsayer? At that moment, I think the nation looked to Terry Wogan for guidance. How would he respond? Which way would this go? </p> <p>\"The best way of removing negativity is to laugh and be joyous, Terry,\" said David. \"So I'm glad that there's been so much laughter in the audience tonight.\" There was a small silence. </p> <p>\"But they're laughing at you,\" said Wogan. \"They're not laughing with you.\" </p> <p>There was a gasp, followed by rapturous applause. So the Canadian coalition was unaware of the moment that David Icke's career had crashed so dramatically in Britain. Had they known, would they have felt differently about the reasons why he said that giant lizards secretly ruled the world? Furthermore, the coalition seemed to have disregarded the fact that many of the lizard-people Icke had publicly named and shamed were not Jewish. There was a piece of compelling evidence that David Icke did mean Jews when he said lizards. Buried somewhere in the middle of his hundreds of thousands of published words is a short paean to the Protocols of Zion - the absurd 19th-century Tsarist forgery proclaiming to be the minutes of a meeting of the Jewish secret rulers of the world: \"Protocol 9: The weapons in our hands are limitless ambition, burning greediness, merciless vengeance, hatred and malice. It is from us that all-engulfing terror proceeds . . . We will not give [the people of the world] peace until they openly acknowledge our international Super-Government.\" </p> <p>It is incredible that this document, which portrays my people as cackling villains from a Saturday matinee, formed the template for contemporary anti-Semitism. It is so obviously a fake. Even if some of us do possess \"limitless ambition, burning greediness, merciless vengeance, hatred and malice\" (and I know I do), we'd never come right out and admit it to our peer group. There are appearances to uphold. </p> <p>But then, David Icke has declared that the Protocols of Zion is evidence not of a Jewish plot, but of a reptilian plot of Illuminati lizards. And nobody would be concerned about David Icke if it wasn't for the fact that his career is now a global sensation; that he lectures to packed houses all over the world, riveting his audiences for six hours at a time with extraordinary revelations; and that pop stars and movie stars request private audiences, with both PW Botha and Winnie Mandela happy to associate themselves with him. Indeed, in terms of the size of his following, he is the most influential racist on the lecture circuit - if, that is, he is a racist. </p> <p>The airport. Two Canadian immigration officers discreetly scanned the queue at passport control. They were holding clipboards. One turned to the other and murmured, \"That's him.\" </p> <p>Although David Icke had overheard this exchange, and was preparing himself for the worst, he feigned breezy innocence by humming Que Sera Sera. He looked different now. The turquoise was long gone. He wore a comfortable sweater. His eyes were messianic-blue, and his grey hair was guru-long. There was little ridicule in his life now. \"Good evening!\" he sang, handing over his passport. It was swiped through the scanner, and two words immediately appeared on the screen: \"Watch for.\" At this, David Icke's composure was shattered. \"So this is life in the free world?\" he boomed. \"It's pathetic! Simply pathetic!\" </p> <p>He was quickly bustled towards a holding room, protesting his innocence along the way. \"I am not an anti-Semite! I have a great respect for the Jewish people. Is this a Jewish plot? No, no, no!\" </p> <p> The authorities eyed him with some distrust. When David Icke said he didn't believe it to be a Jewish plot, was this code? Did he really mean that he did believe it to be a Jewish plot? What, exactly, was he thinking? </p> <p>I was, of course, not there to witness what happened to David Icke inside the holding room. But from his own description of the events relayed to me later, I have attempted to piece the scene together. A man in rubber gloves scattered the contents of his baggage across a table - his clothes and toiletries and reading matter - and began to scrutinise them for some tangible evidence of anti-Semitism. </p> <p>\"Yes.\" clarified David Icke, \"the families in positions of great financial power obsessively interbreed with each other. But I'm not talking about one earth race, Jewish or non-Jewish. I'm talking about a genetic network that operates through all races, this bloodline being a fusion of human and reptilian genes.\" He threw up his hands. \"And now, suddenly, the idea is that I'm saying it is a gigantic Jewish plot. But let me make myself clear - this does not in any way relate to an earth race.\" </p> <p>David Icke's line of defence was clear. When he said lizards, he really was referring to lizards. He was not talking about cockroaches, or amphibians in general, contrary to the suggestions mooted at the meeting in Vancouver, but Annunaki lizards, specifically, from the lower fourth dimension. </p> <p>The immigration officers glanced at each other, attempting to square this denial with the memo they had received from a coalition of respectable and trustworthy anti-racist groups, accusing David Icke of anti-Semitism. Finally, after four hours of questioning, they concluded that when David Icke said lizards, lizards was what he meant. He was free to enter the country. There was no law against this. How could the lawmakers anticipate that sort of thing? </p> <p>David Icke shook hands with the immigration officers, collected his things and wandered outside to the concourse, where his entourage was waiting in a car to pick him up. It was 2am. </p> <p>\"It is certainly not a misunderstanding,\" said David, as we were chauffeured from the airport to the hotel. \"They are assassinating my character.\" </p> <p>\"But why would they want to do that?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"Because I am getting too close to the truth.\" He looked out of the window. \"I miss my little boy,\" he said. \"I cannot tell you the agony of being away from my little boy. But you've got to keep walking and talking.\" </p> <p>We reached the hotel, checked in, retired to our rooms for showers, and met again in the foyer. David was jetlagged and downcast. \"Would I want to do other things with my life, something other than all this frigging travelling? God, yes.\" </p> <p>\"What would you be doing if you weren't doing this?\" I asked him. </p> <p>\"Something related to sport,\" he said. \"I still love sport.\" </p> <p>\"I guess you've burnt your bridges with the BBC,\" I said. </p> <p>\"Oh, I'd never go back to that.\" he said. \"The thought of presenting the same programme day after day, year after year. I think I'd have taken the pill by now. But do I want to go around radio station after radio station, book signing after book signing, interview after interview? No.\" </p> <p>We had breakfast and then we walked the three blocks to the studio of AM 1040 Radio One, where David was booked for a celebrity appearance on the morning show. David was now more alert and cheerful. Smiling, he entered reception. We were greeted by the station manager, a small man wearing glasses and a friendly striped jumper. </p> <p>\"Hi!\" David smiled, extending his hand. \"David Icke. I'm due to be on a programme at 10.15.\" </p> <p>\"Okay,\" said the station manager. He coughed. \"I've reviewed the material that was submitted to us, and I've also reviewed the radio regulations of 1986 . . .\" </p> <p>\"I don't believe this,\" murmured David. </p> <p>\"And I don't feel comfortable having you on.\" </p> <p>\"Why?\" </p> <p>\"I just don't feel comfortable. That's it. Thanks for coming in.\" The station manager clapped his hands together. \"Thanks very much.\" </p> <p>\"You invited me to your radio station,\" said David patiently. \"I turned up on time, and now you stand here and say without any substance or explanation that you're not having me on?\" </p> <p>\"Thanks for coming in,\" said the station manager. </p> <p>\"You know what?\" said David, leaning across the reception desk. Their faces were now inches apart. \"It's pathetic. You say you believe in freedom? You couldn't spell it.\" </p> <p>He turned to me. \"This,\" he said, pointing at the station manager, \"is one of the architects, unknowingly, of the destruction of our freedom.\" </p> <p>\"You did say you were sick of doing radio interviews,\" I offered. </p> <p>\"That's not the point,\" said David. \"The information is being suppressed by unknowing, frightened little men like him.\" </p> <p>\"Oh, thanks,\" said the station manager. </p> <p>\"This is unbelievable,\" said David. He was now addressing my notepad. \"Oh no, there's no conspiracy, no cover-up, no suppression, ladies and gentlemen of the world.\" </p> <p>\"Please leave,\" said the station manager. </p> <p>That night, at Rosie's Bar in downtown Vancouver, David and some of his entourage drank mournfully until closing time. Word had just reached them that another media interview and a personal appearance in a bookshop had been successfully prevented by the coalition. There was only so much to be gained from being the maligned victim, the speaker of truth in a venal world. This was now becoming a serious problem. Book sales were at risk. </p> <p>David's entourage attempted to buoy him up. \"At least this blows the myth of a free media in Vancouver,\" said a quiet, bearded Austrian called Henrick. \"Clarity is good, right? At least this clarifies things.\" </p> <p>\"Yeah,\" said David, wearily. </p> <p>I could not determine how Henrick fitted into the Icke camp. He just seemed to be there all the time, one of perhaps a dozen men and women in Vancouver who drove for David, picked up the hotel and restaurant bills, took him aside to whisper things that I couldn't hear, transported the books and the videos, organised the media engagements, kept the cottage industry rolling. </p> <p>But the most surprising presence within David's entourage was that of Brian Selby, a veteran local journalist from the left and a one-time prominent Greenpeace activist. (The coalition was mystified by Brian's apparent defection to the far right. It had been the subject of much debate during their anti-Icke meeting.) </p> <p>\"I've been in this town 15 years,\" said Brian, \"and I've gotta say that this is the most twisted political cluster-fuck I've ever seen. You've got the weirdest coalition. You've got the draconian powers of the Canadian Jewish congress. Then you've got people with a history of being progressive. The Seattle protesters . . .\" </p> <p>\"Nobody does all this against one person unless there's something much bigger going on behind the scenes,\" added David. </p> <p>\"You've got to have a lot of power to call up a radio station and get the plug pulled on a show,\" agreed Brian. </p> <p>\"They're sending us a message. They're saying, 'Don't fuck with us now or forever more.'\" </p> <p>There was a silence. \"Who is pulling the strings?\" said David. </p> <p>After David went to bed, Brian and Henrick elected to take matters into their own hands. \"We need to defuse this whole concept that David Icke is an anti-Semite,\" said Brian. </p> <p>\"But how?\" I asked. </p> <p>Brian said he still had some friends inside the anti-Icke camp from his days as a leftist activist. He would use his contacts to initiate a meeting. But how to convince them of David's innocence? </p> <p> Here, Brian and Henrick fundamentally disagreed. Henrick argued that the coalition needed to understand that David Icke's lizard claims were \"politically relevant\" (the lizards being the hidden hand behind corporate globalisation) and that they had a \"factual core\" (there was much talk here of archaeological evidence linking ancient cultures with reptilian invaders). </p> <p>Brian, however, wanted to keep the lizards out of it all together. \"I mean it,\" he said, severely. \"Don't mention the lizards. The lizards just confuse things. Jon?\" </p> <p>\"The lizards muddy the waters,\" I agreed. </p> <p>\"Okay,\" murmured Henrick, sullenly. </p> <p>\"So what's your argument?\" I asked Brian. </p> <p>\"Two words,\" he said. \"Noam Chomsky.\" </p> <p>\"The Jewish intellectual?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"David, at his most controversial,\" explained Brian, \"is saying nothing that Noam Chomsky hasn't himself written regarding, for example, powerful Zionists.\" He paused. \"What do you think?\" </p> <p>\"It isn't unconvincing,\" I said. </p> <p>\"This is open and shut,\" said Brian. \"Chomsky is the darling of the left. There's no way they can argue with that. Do you reckon?\" </p> <p>I shrugged. \"It will be interesting to see how they might argue with that,\" I said. </p> <p>The next evening, Brian and Henrick and I met Sam, the coalition's unofficial organiser, on neutral ground at a downtown bar. The stakes were high. More media interviews had been prevented by the coalition. Furthermore, the anti-racists seemed to be on the verge of convincing the Canadian hate crimes unit that Icke's books should be seized and literally incinerated, and Icke himself deported. </p> <p>\"Hello, Brian,\"nodded Sam, formally. </p> <p>\"Sam,\" nodded Brian. \"This is Henrick.\" </p> <p>Henrick nodded formally. </p> <p>\"Jon,\" nodded Sam. </p> <p>\"I'm just here as an impartial observer,\" I said. \"I'm just going to sit here.\" </p> <p>\"Okay,\" agreed the two camps. </p> <p>The formalities were over and the discussion began. </p> <p>\"So,\" said Sam, \"you say that Icke is not an anti-Semite.\" Brian held up his finger to say \"wait a minute\" and he rifled through his briefcase. He retrieved a sheaf of photocopies, which contained the writings of Noam Chomsky. Brian had marked passages that convincingly reflected his thesis - that David Icke was no more anti-Semitic than this respected Jewish scholar. </p> <p>Sam studied the photocopies. He nodded thoughtfully. \"This might be true to an extent,\" he finally agreed. \"But there is a very big difference between Noam Chomsky saying it and David Icke saying it.\" </p> <p>\"Which is?\" asked Brian, his eyes narrowing. </p> <p>\"Well, firstly,\" said Sam, \"Noam Chomsky is Jewish. Secondly, Noam Chomsky is not mad. Thirdly, Noam Chomsky is, in fact, an intellectual. And, finally, Noam Chomsky is not an anti-Semite.\" </p> <p>Henrick shuffled uneasily in his chair. He clearly felt that Brian's modus operandi was falling apart before their eyes. Yes, Henrick had promised to leave the lizards out of the discussion, but these were desperate times, and they called for desperate measures. </p> <p>Henrick shot me a glance. \"Go for it,\" I mouthed. </p> <p>\"There is full documentation,\" announced Henrick, which proves that 20 reptilian races have interfaced, intermingled and interbred with the human race, and are now controlling society from above.\" </p> <p>Brian stared daggers at Henrick. </p> <p>\"Twenty?\" said Sam, leaning forward. </p> <p>\"Approximately 20,\" said Henrick. \"Certainly it is somewhere between 15 and 25.\" </p> <p>\"Have you got the names of these reptilian races?\" asked Sam, producing a notepad from his bag. </p> <p>\"Yes, I have,\" said Henrick, obviously pleased that Sam was showing an interest. \"Okay. Firstly: Grays.\" </p> <p>Sam wrote down Grays. </p> <p>\"Next there are the Adopted Grays.\" </p> <p>Sam wrote it down. </p> <p>\"Then there are the Troglodytes.\" </p> <p>\"They're the ones who live in caves, right?\" said Sam. </p> <p>\"In caves,\" confirmed Henrick. \"Then there are the Crinklies.\" </p> <p>\"What do the Crinklies look like?\" asked Sam. </p> <p>\"They are cuddly, pink, with old-looking faces,\" said Henrick. </p> <p>\"Can I just point out,\" interrupted Brian, sharply, \"this Chomsky passage regarding the oppressive subtext of the Talmud . . .\" </p> <p>\"Then there are the Tall Blondes,\" said Henrick. </p> <p>\"What do they look like?\" asked Sam. </p> <p>\"Kind of like Swedes,\" said Henrick. \"Next come the Tall Robots.\" </p> <p>\"They're the ones covered in aluminium foil, right?\" </p> <p>\"Right,\" said Henrick. \"Then there are the Annunaki.\" </p> <p>\"The Annunaki,\" said Sam. \"They're the ones David Icke goes on about the most.\" </p> <p>\"Exactly,\" said Henrick. \"George Bush is Annunaki.\" </p> <p>Sam excused himself so he could step outside for a cigarette. He returned to discover that Henrick had taken the opportunity to grab his notepad and add further names of reptilian races to the list. </p> <p>\"The Elderbarians,\" he had written. \"These are the crop-circle makers. The Zebra Repticular. The Albarians. The Interdimensional Sasquatch. The Goat Sucker or Goat Eater often found in Mexico.\" </p> <p>\"Is there friction between these alien races?\" asked Sam. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" said Henrick. \"Constant friction.\" </p> <p>\"Do they actually fight each other?\" asked Sam. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" said Henrick. \"They are constantly battling for control of the 15 dimensional portals. One is in Jerusalem. One is in Tibet. Nobody knows where the other 13 are.\" </p> <p>\"This,\" said Sam. \"is a very interesting conversation.\" </p> <p>\"That was very weird,\" said Sam to me after Brian and Henrick had gone home. </p> <p>\"It was weird,\" I agreed. \"You know, I've been trying to keep an open mind, but now I'm pretty certain that David Icke really does mean lizards when he says lizards.\" </p> <p>But the anti-racists were still not convinced. \"It's the hidden reptilian hand of Judaism coming to take over the world,\" said a coalition member called Richard Warman. \"It's all about dehumanising your enemies. How do we make Jews despicable, sub-human, and worthy of our condemnation? So, yes, I still believe that when David Icke says lizards he means Jews.\" </p> <p>It looked as if things could get no worse for David Icke. His supporters had pulled out all the stops to dampen hostility towards him, but even Henrick's intricate lizard dissertation had failed to convince Sam that David was not an anti-Semite. Now he was a martyr. His fans started approaching him on the street, shaking his hand, sometimes even breaking into spontaneous rounds of applause, offering words of support. </p> <p>\"It's so terrible what those awful Jewish people are doing to you,\" said one old lady. </p> <p>\"Little me!\" David put his hand on his heart. \"This 'nutter', as they call me. If I'm mad like they say I am, why don't they leave me alone? But ever since I started exposing the reptilian elite, the opposite has happened. Why is that?\" </p> <p>\"The Jews are drawing their own parallels,\" suggested one fan. \"Nothing that you have ever said could in any way be construed as anti-Semitism. They're just paranoid. It's not true. You are not an anti-Semite.\" </p> <p>\"Jewish people have suffered as much if not more from this global manipulation as anyone else,\" agreed David. \"Far from being the perpetuators of it, they are massive victims of it. And, in terms of racism, my own daughter's boyfriend is himself black.\" </p> <p>\"You've changed my life,\" said another fan. \"I used to be a sheep, I used to be like them, but you've changed my life.\" </p> <p>On Thursday, the anti-Icke camp suffered a public humiliation. VTV, Vancouver's popular local television station, decided to ignore the coalition's request to cancel David's scheduled TV appearance. Instead, it put him on live - head to head with an eminent local psychology professor called Bill Bierstein: </p> <p>Host: \"Professor, why do you think Mr Icke has such a following when a lot of people would think his ideas are out of this world?\" </p> <p>David (turning furiously to host): \"What research have you done on that? Nothing! Nothing! Nonsense!\" </p> <p>Professor: \"People like to enchant themselves. They want there to be grand conspiracies by superpowerful beings, rather than just a bunch of mistakes made by decent people . . .\" </p> <p>David: \"Professor!(To host) Is he going to go on forever?\" </p> <p>Host: \"Let's get Mr Icke to respond to that.\" </p> <p>David: \"Professor, did you major in patronising the people of British Columbia?\" </p> <p>Professor: \"Well, there's no need for insulting comments.\" </p> <p>David: \"Okay, tell me about the Bilderberg Group.\" </p> <p>Host (interrupting): \"Let's talk about why . . .\" </p> <p>David (thunderously): \"Don't tell me what I'm going to say. Tell me about the Bilderberg Group!\" </p> <p>Host (listening anxiously into her earpiece): \"Mr Icke, we don't want to talk about that right now. Let's talk about . . .\" </p> <p>David (a knowing smile): \"I'm sure you don't!\" </p> <p>Host: \"Why are Jewish groups calling you anti-Semitic?\" </p> <p>David: \"Because I'm getting too close to the truth.\" </p> <p>Professor (laughing): \"Don't get into these convoluted paranoid fantasies that people are trying to shut you up . . .\" </p> <p>This was, under the circumstances, the wrong thing to say. David could be accused of many things, but fantasising that he was being censored was not one of them. David smiled a little, and then he went in for the kill. </p> <p>David: \"I have had three major interviews pulled this week. I've had book signings cancelled. You wanna read the papers a bit more, mate! There Are Lizards And There Are Lizards.\" </p> <p>The Professor faltered. Professor: \"Well, uh, if you have nothing better to do than to insult me, then I'm sorry for your process of thought . . .\" </p> <p>But it was over. The professor had blown it. In the days that followed this TV debate, some of the coalition began privately admitting to me that the whole thing was beginning to backfire. David Icke's fans were not, by and large, anti-Semites. It was more alarming than that. They were, in fact, the coalition's core constituents - liberals and anti-racists and left-wingers concerned with the perils of global capitalism. These people were beginning to look upon the coalition as the villains, as the hidden hand, as \"them\". </p> <p>\u00a9 Jon Ronson, 2001.

      "bodyText": "In a meeting room in a community centre in Vancouver, the blackboard said \"Strategy\" and the leaflets said \"Bigot Alert\". A coalition of prominent anti-racist organisations shook hands and took their seats, notepads at the ready. A \"leading racist\" was about to land in Canada on a speaking tour. TV and radio stations were vying to secure chatshow bookings. There would be celebrity appearances, meet-and-greet-the-fans sessions and high-profile book signings. This was, the coalition felt, an unusual and disquieting turn of events. The media do not, as a rule, scramble to book racists for celebrity appearances. But this was an unusual racist, they said. \"Above all,\" began the chair of the meeting, \"David Icke represents a political threat. His writings are anti-Semitic. David Icke states that the global elite, the Illuminati who dominate every aspect of our lives, are genetically descended from an extraterrestrial race of reptiles who came to earth some time ago in the form of humans, who are capable of changing their shape, who engage in ritual child sacrifice, who drink blood . . .\" The coalition shook their heads wearily. In terms of code words, they had now heard it all. \"What is this crap, this metaphorically hidden language?\" asked a member of Anti-Racist Action, a visiting scientist from Somalia. \"Who is a lizard? It's bullshit. Bullshit! As a human being, you have to use proper language.\" \"What do these words imply?\" I asked him. \"What do you think they imply?\" he replied. \"Lizards? Reptiles? Cockroaches? Amphibians? They imply hatred. Racist hatred.\" \"Do you think that, when David Icke says lizards, he means Jews?\" I asked. \"Of course!\" he said. \"What is lizard? What is amphibian? It is a pile of rubbish. Why he's using those terminologies such as lizards? This vile language. Vile bullshit. I'm totally, culturally shocked.\" \"So,\" continued the chair, \"what are we going to do about this?\" Wheels had already been set in motion. The Canadian hate crimes unit had been alerted. So had the media. The coalition had also written to the former Canadian prime minister, Brian Mulroney, to inform him that David Icke was accusing him of being a reptilian, child-sacrificing paedophile. But so far, to the coalition's bafflement, Mulroney had declined to initiate legal action. Indeed, every individual accused of reptilian paedophilia by David Icke had so far failed to sue, including Bob Hope, George Bush, George Bush Jr, Ted Heath, the Rothschild family, Boxcar Willie, the Queen of England, the Queen Mother, Prince Philip, Kris Kristofferson, Al Gore and the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group. \"Why do you think that is?\" David Icke had asked me when I interviewed him about this matter in London. Then he turned to my notepad and thundered, \"Come on, Ted Heath! Sue me if you've got nothing to hide! Come on, George Bush! I'm ready! Sue me! I'm naming names! Come on, Jon? Why are they refusing to sue me?\" There was a silence. \"Because they are twelve-foot lizards?\" I suggested, smally. \"Yes!\" said David. \"Exactly!\" \"Keep in mind that this is not a meeting to debate what David Icke stands for,\" announced the chair back in Vancouver. \"This is a meeting for people who are opposed to David Icke's presence in the community. I would like to know if any people here consider themselves supporters of David Icke?\" There was a silence. \"I . . . uh . . . haven't made up my mind yet,\" said a man in a beige jacket whom nobody recognised. \"I don't know what David Icke stands for. I have been fighting Nazis for 20 years, but sometimes it is difficult to tell who the Nazis are.\" This man was unshaven. His blond hair was long and lank. Anti-racists shared quiet glances. Strictly speaking, this man had - by failing to have made up his mind - contravened the stated rule. This meeting was for people who had made up their minds. But the tacit consensus was not, at this stage, to demand his removal from the room. \"David Icke is opposed to community values,\" explained the chair patiently. \"The purpose of this meeting is to organise against David Icke. If that is not your purpose, you might want to reconsider whether this is a meeting you want to be at.\" A beat allowed this thought to linger, and then the subject was changed. \"He's clearly out to act as a conduit to the patriot movement,\" said Tony from the British Columbia Socialist Caucus, \"the far-right anti-Semitic racist militia movement.\" It was at this moment that the stranger in the beige jacket made a startling announcement. \"I have been in the militia movement of the United States for four years,\" he said, \"and I only ever met one racist there.\" The action that followed this declaration was swift. \"I think at this point it may be unproductive if you continue to remain in the room,\" said the chair. The militiaman looked shaken by this rapid response. \"If you . . . uh . . . want to rule me out, fine,\" he stammered, \"but I just wanted to see if I could do anything to help.\" \"I think that people are uncomfortable with you sitting at the meeting.\" \"I came to hear what David Icke was about and whether I could help,\" he said. \"Could I just ask two questions?\" \"But this isn't a debate,\" smiled the chair. \"Okay. Okay. I'll go. But could I just ask . . .\" \"Please, no.\" \"I'm gone,\" he said. \"I'm gone.\" Then he left. A break was called. In the car park, informal suggestions were thrown around over cigarettes by the younger and more rebellious activists. Someone offered to launch a physical attack on David Icke at his hotel. I suspected a giant misunderstanding was in danger of spiralling out of control. Knowing what I did about David Icke's past - specifically, his startling announcement on the Terry Wogan chatshow on BBC1 in 1991 that he was the Son of God - I guessed that when he said that 12ft lizards secretly ruled the world, he really was referring to lizards. But what did I know? The code words did seem to be increasingly abstruse. I elected to remain an impartial observer to the unfolding events in Vancouver in the hope that some clarity might develop in the days ahead. Wogan. The blue comedian Jim Davidson was top of the bill that night (this was primetime BBC1, in the autumn of 1991), but most of the viewers had tuned in to see Terry Wogan's first guest. There had been rumours in the tabloids all week that something unexpected had happened to David Icke, the popular BBC sports personality, once a professional football player, now the host of Grandstand and a household name. The tabloids said that David Icke had started wearing only turquoise, that he was predicting cataclysmic flooding and earthquakes - and that he was claiming to be the Son of God. I had watched a videotape of this broadcast before leaving London for Vancouver. It was startling to see how David Icke looked, how haggard and exhausted and terribly nervous - so unlike the genial BBC soccer and snooker correspondent whom the British public had come to feel so comfortable with - and dressed from head to toe in a turquoise shellsuit (turquoise being a conduit of positive energy) as he stepped out on to the stage. \"Why you?\" asked Wogan with an incredulity that reflected the mood of the land. \"Why have you been chosen?\" \"People would have said the same thing to Jesus,\" David Icke replied. \"Who the heck are you? You're a carpenter's son.\" \"When might we expect tidal waves, eruptions and earthquakes?\" asked Wogan. \"They will certainly happen this year,\" said David. This conversation took place amid howls of laughter from the studio audience. \"Why should we believe you?\" said Wogan. \"I'm saying that these things are going to happen this year,\" said David, \"so we'll see, won't we?\" \"And what will happen to you if they don't happen?\" asked Wogan. \"They will happen,\" said David. He said this with such ferocity, such conviction, that the audience stopped laughing for a moment. However wise and modern we are, this kind of thing can still shake us up. You could feel it sweep across the television studio, sweep across the land, a stirring of some primordial paranoia. Could David Icke actually be a soothsayer? At that moment, I think the nation looked to Terry Wogan for guidance. How would he respond? Which way would this go? \"The best way of removing negativity is to laugh and be joyous, Terry,\" said David. \"So I'm glad that there's been so much laughter in the audience tonight.\" There was a small silence. \"But they're laughing at you,\" said Wogan. \"They're not laughing with you.\" There was a gasp, followed by rapturous applause. So the Canadian coalition was unaware of the moment that David Icke's career had crashed so dramatically in Britain. Had they known, would they have felt differently about the reasons why he said that giant lizards secretly ruled the world? Furthermore, the coalition seemed to have disregarded the fact that many of the lizard-people Icke had publicly named and shamed were not Jewish. There was a piece of compelling evidence that David Icke did mean Jews when he said lizards. Buried somewhere in the middle of his hundreds of thousands of published words is a short paean to the Protocols of Zion - the absurd 19th-century Tsarist forgery proclaiming to be the minutes of a meeting of the Jewish secret rulers of the world: \"Protocol 9: The weapons in our hands are limitless ambition, burning greediness, merciless vengeance, hatred and malice. It is from us that all-engulfing terror proceeds . . . We will not give [the people of the world] peace until they openly acknowledge our international Super-Government.\" It is incredible that this document, which portrays my people as cackling villains from a Saturday matinee, formed the template for contemporary anti-Semitism. It is so obviously a fake. Even if some of us do possess \"limitless ambition, burning greediness, merciless vengeance, hatred and malice\" (and I know I do), we'd never come right out and admit it to our peer group. There are appearances to uphold. But then, David Icke has declared that the Protocols of Zion is evidence not of a Jewish plot, but of a reptilian plot of Illuminati lizards. And nobody would be concerned about David Icke if it wasn't for the fact that his career is now a global sensation; that he lectures to packed houses all over the world, riveting his audiences for six hours at a time with extraordinary revelations; and that pop stars and movie stars request private audiences, with both PW Botha and Winnie Mandela happy to associate themselves with him. Indeed, in terms of the size of his following, he is the most influential racist on the lecture circuit - if, that is, he is a racist. The airport. Two Canadian immigration officers discreetly scanned the queue at passport control. They were holding clipboards. One turned to the other and murmured, \"That's him.\" Although David Icke had overheard this exchange, and was preparing himself for the worst, he feigned breezy innocence by humming Que Sera Sera. He looked different now. The turquoise was long gone. He wore a comfortable sweater. His eyes were messianic-blue, and his grey hair was guru-long. There was little ridicule in his life now. \"Good evening!\" he sang, handing over his passport. It was swiped through the scanner, and two words immediately appeared on the screen: \"Watch for.\" At this, David Icke's composure was shattered. \"So this is life in the free world?\" he boomed. \"It's pathetic! Simply pathetic!\" He was quickly bustled towards a holding room, protesting his innocence along the way. \"I am not an anti-Semite! I have a great respect for the Jewish people. Is this a Jewish plot? No, no, no!\" The authorities eyed him with some distrust. When David Icke said he didn't believe it to be a Jewish plot, was this code? Did he really mean that he did believe it to be a Jewish plot? What, exactly, was he thinking? I was, of course, not there to witness what happened to David Icke inside the holding room. But from his own description of the events relayed to me later, I have attempted to piece the scene together. A man in rubber gloves scattered the contents of his baggage across a table - his clothes and toiletries and reading matter - and began to scrutinise them for some tangible evidence of anti-Semitism. \"Yes.\" clarified David Icke, \"the families in positions of great financial power obsessively interbreed with each other. But I'm not talking about one earth race, Jewish or non-Jewish. I'm talking about a genetic network that operates through all races, this bloodline being a fusion of human and reptilian genes.\" He threw up his hands. \"And now, suddenly, the idea is that I'm saying it is a gigantic Jewish plot. But let me make myself clear - this does not in any way relate to an earth race.\" David Icke's line of defence was clear. When he said lizards, he really was referring to lizards. He was not talking about cockroaches, or amphibians in general, contrary to the suggestions mooted at the meeting in Vancouver, but Annunaki lizards, specifically, from the lower fourth dimension. The immigration officers glanced at each other, attempting to square this denial with the memo they had received from a coalition of respectable and trustworthy anti-racist groups, accusing David Icke of anti-Semitism. Finally, after four hours of questioning, they concluded that when David Icke said lizards, lizards was what he meant. He was free to enter the country. There was no law against this. How could the lawmakers anticipate that sort of thing? David Icke shook hands with the immigration officers, collected his things and wandered outside to the concourse, where his entourage was waiting in a car to pick him up. It was 2am. \"It is certainly not a misunderstanding,\" said David, as we were chauffeured from the airport to the hotel. \"They are assassinating my character.\" \"But why would they want to do that?\" I asked. \"Because I am getting too close to the truth.\" He looked out of the window. \"I miss my little boy,\" he said. \"I cannot tell you the agony of being away from my little boy. But you've got to keep walking and talking.\" We reached the hotel, checked in, retired to our rooms for showers, and met again in the foyer. David was jetlagged and downcast. \"Would I want to do other things with my life, something other than all this frigging travelling? God, yes.\" \"What would you be doing if you weren't doing this?\" I asked him. \"Something related to sport,\" he said. \"I still love sport.\" \"I guess you've burnt your bridges with the BBC,\" I said. \"Oh, I'd never go back to that.\" he said. \"The thought of presenting the same programme day after day, year after year. I think I'd have taken the pill by now. But do I want to go around radio station after radio station, book signing after book signing, interview after interview? No.\" We had breakfast and then we walked the three blocks to the studio of AM 1040 Radio One, where David was booked for a celebrity appearance on the morning show. David was now more alert and cheerful. Smiling, he entered reception. We were greeted by the station manager, a small man wearing glasses and a friendly striped jumper. \"Hi!\" David smiled, extending his hand. \"David Icke. I'm due to be on a programme at 10.15.\" \"Okay,\" said the station manager. He coughed. \"I've reviewed the material that was submitted to us, and I've also reviewed the radio regulations of 1986 . . .\" \"I don't believe this,\" murmured David. \"And I don't feel comfortable having you on.\" \"Why?\" \"I just don't feel comfortable. That's it. Thanks for coming in.\" The station manager clapped his hands together. \"Thanks very much.\" \"You invited me to your radio station,\" said David patiently. \"I turned up on time, and now you stand here and say without any substance or explanation that you're not having me on?\" \"Thanks for coming in,\" said the station manager. \"You know what?\" said David, leaning across the reception desk. Their faces were now inches apart. \"It's pathetic. You say you believe in freedom? You couldn't spell it.\" He turned to me. \"This,\" he said, pointing at the station manager, \"is one of the architects, unknowingly, of the destruction of our freedom.\" \"You did say you were sick of doing radio interviews,\" I offered. \"That's not the point,\" said David. \"The information is being suppressed by unknowing, frightened little men like him.\" \"Oh, thanks,\" said the station manager. \"This is unbelievable,\" said David. He was now addressing my notepad. \"Oh no, there's no conspiracy, no cover-up, no suppression, ladies and gentlemen of the world.\" \"Please leave,\" said the station manager. That night, at Rosie's Bar in downtown Vancouver, David and some of his entourage drank mournfully until closing time. Word had just reached them that another media interview and a personal appearance in a bookshop had been successfully prevented by the coalition. There was only so much to be gained from being the maligned victim, the speaker of truth in a venal world. This was now becoming a serious problem. Book sales were at risk. David's entourage attempted to buoy him up. \"At least this blows the myth of a free media in Vancouver,\" said a quiet, bearded Austrian called Henrick. \"Clarity is good, right? At least this clarifies things.\" \"Yeah,\" said David, wearily. I could not determine how Henrick fitted into the Icke camp. He just seemed to be there all the time, one of perhaps a dozen men and women in Vancouver who drove for David, picked up the hotel and restaurant bills, took him aside to whisper things that I couldn't hear, transported the books and the videos, organised the media engagements, kept the cottage industry rolling. But the most surprising presence within David's entourage was that of Brian Selby, a veteran local journalist from the left and a one-time prominent Greenpeace activist. (The coalition was mystified by Brian's apparent defection to the far right. It had been the subject of much debate during their anti-Icke meeting.) \"I've been in this town 15 years,\" said Brian, \"and I've gotta say that this is the most twisted political cluster-fuck I've ever seen. You've got the weirdest coalition. You've got the draconian powers of the Canadian Jewish congress. Then you've got people with a history of being progressive. The Seattle protesters . . .\" \"Nobody does all this against one person unless there's something much bigger going on behind the scenes,\" added David. \"You've got to have a lot of power to call up a radio station and get the plug pulled on a show,\" agreed Brian. \"They're sending us a message. They're saying, 'Don't fuck with us now or forever more.'\" There was a silence. \"Who is pulling the strings?\" said David. After David went to bed, Brian and Henrick elected to take matters into their own hands. \"We need to defuse this whole concept that David Icke is an anti-Semite,\" said Brian. \"But how?\" I asked. Brian said he still had some friends inside the anti-Icke camp from his days as a leftist activist. He would use his contacts to initiate a meeting. But how to convince them of David's innocence? Here, Brian and Henrick fundamentally disagreed. Henrick argued that the coalition needed to understand that David Icke's lizard claims were \"politically relevant\" (the lizards being the hidden hand behind corporate globalisation) and that they had a \"factual core\" (there was much talk here of archaeological evidence linking ancient cultures with reptilian invaders). Brian, however, wanted to keep the lizards out of it all together. \"I mean it,\" he said, severely. \"Don't mention the lizards. The lizards just confuse things. Jon?\" \"The lizards muddy the waters,\" I agreed. \"Okay,\" murmured Henrick, sullenly. \"So what's your argument?\" I asked Brian. \"Two words,\" he said. \"Noam Chomsky.\" \"The Jewish intellectual?\" I asked. \"David, at his most controversial,\" explained Brian, \"is saying nothing that Noam Chomsky hasn't himself written regarding, for example, powerful Zionists.\" He paused. \"What do you think?\" \"It isn't unconvincing,\" I said. \"This is open and shut,\" said Brian. \"Chomsky is the darling of the left. There's no way they can argue with that. Do you reckon?\" I shrugged. \"It will be interesting to see how they might argue with that,\" I said. The next evening, Brian and Henrick and I met Sam, the coalition's unofficial organiser, on neutral ground at a downtown bar. The stakes were high. More media interviews had been prevented by the coalition. Furthermore, the anti-racists seemed to be on the verge of convincing the Canadian hate crimes unit that Icke's books should be seized and literally incinerated, and Icke himself deported. \"Hello, Brian,\"nodded Sam, formally. \"Sam,\" nodded Brian. \"This is Henrick.\" Henrick nodded formally. \"Jon,\" nodded Sam. \"I'm just here as an impartial observer,\" I said. \"I'm just going to sit here.\" \"Okay,\" agreed the two camps. The formalities were over and the discussion began. \"So,\" said Sam, \"you say that Icke is not an anti-Semite.\" Brian held up his finger to say \"wait a minute\" and he rifled through his briefcase. He retrieved a sheaf of photocopies, which contained the writings of Noam Chomsky. Brian had marked passages that convincingly reflected his thesis - that David Icke was no more anti-Semitic than this respected Jewish scholar. Sam studied the photocopies. He nodded thoughtfully. \"This might be true to an extent,\" he finally agreed. \"But there is a very big difference between Noam Chomsky saying it and David Icke saying it.\" \"Which is?\" asked Brian, his eyes narrowing. \"Well, firstly,\" said Sam, \"Noam Chomsky is Jewish. Secondly, Noam Chomsky is not mad. Thirdly, Noam Chomsky is, in fact, an intellectual. And, finally, Noam Chomsky is not an anti-Semite.\" Henrick shuffled uneasily in his chair. He clearly felt that Brian's modus operandi was falling apart before their eyes. Yes, Henrick had promised to leave the lizards out of the discussion, but these were desperate times, and they called for desperate measures. Henrick shot me a glance. \"Go for it,\" I mouthed. \"There is full documentation,\" announced Henrick, which proves that 20 reptilian races have interfaced, intermingled and interbred with the human race, and are now controlling society from above.\" Brian stared daggers at Henrick. \"Twenty?\" said Sam, leaning forward. \"Approximately 20,\" said Henrick. \"Certainly it is somewhere between 15 and 25.\" \"Have you got the names of these reptilian races?\" asked Sam, producing a notepad from his bag. \"Yes, I have,\" said Henrick, obviously pleased that Sam was showing an interest. \"Okay. Firstly: Grays.\" Sam wrote down Grays. \"Next there are the Adopted Grays.\" Sam wrote it down. \"Then there are the Troglodytes.\" \"They're the ones who live in caves, right?\" said Sam. \"In caves,\" confirmed Henrick. \"Then there are the Crinklies.\" \"What do the Crinklies look like?\" asked Sam. \"They are cuddly, pink, with old-looking faces,\" said Henrick. \"Can I just point out,\" interrupted Brian, sharply, \"this Chomsky passage regarding the oppressive subtext of the Talmud . . .\" \"Then there are the Tall Blondes,\" said Henrick. \"What do they look like?\" asked Sam. \"Kind of like Swedes,\" said Henrick. \"Next come the Tall Robots.\" \"They're the ones covered in aluminium foil, right?\" \"Right,\" said Henrick. \"Then there are the Annunaki.\" \"The Annunaki,\" said Sam. \"They're the ones David Icke goes on about the most.\" \"Exactly,\" said Henrick. \"George Bush is Annunaki.\" Sam excused himself so he could step outside for a cigarette. He returned to discover that Henrick had taken the opportunity to grab his notepad and add further names of reptilian races to the list. \"The Elderbarians,\" he had written. \"These are the crop-circle makers. The Zebra Repticular. The Albarians. The Interdimensional Sasquatch. The Goat Sucker or Goat Eater often found in Mexico.\" \"Is there friction between these alien races?\" asked Sam. \"Yes,\" said Henrick. \"Constant friction.\" \"Do they actually fight each other?\" asked Sam. \"Yes,\" said Henrick. \"They are constantly battling for control of the 15 dimensional portals. One is in Jerusalem. One is in Tibet. Nobody knows where the other 13 are.\" \"This,\" said Sam. \"is a very interesting conversation.\" \"That was very weird,\" said Sam to me after Brian and Henrick had gone home. \"It was weird,\" I agreed. \"You know, I've been trying to keep an open mind, but now I'm pretty certain that David Icke really does mean lizards when he says lizards.\" But the anti-racists were still not convinced. \"It's the hidden reptilian hand of Judaism coming to take over the world,\" said a coalition member called Richard Warman. \"It's all about dehumanising your enemies. How do we make Jews despicable, sub-human, and worthy of our condemnation? So, yes, I still believe that when David Icke says lizards he means Jews.\" It looked as if things could get no worse for David Icke. His supporters had pulled out all the stops to dampen hostility towards him, but even Henrick's intricate lizard dissertation had failed to convince Sam that David was not an anti-Semite. Now he was a martyr. His fans started approaching him on the street, shaking his hand, sometimes even breaking into spontaneous rounds of applause, offering words of support. \"It's so terrible what those awful Jewish people are doing to you,\" said one old lady. \"Little me!\" David put his hand on his heart. \"This 'nutter', as they call me. If I'm mad like they say I am, why don't they leave me alone? But ever since I started exposing the reptilian elite, the opposite has happened. Why is that?\" \"The Jews are drawing their own parallels,\" suggested one fan. \"Nothing that you have ever said could in any way be construed as anti-Semitism. They're just paranoid. It's not true. You are not an anti-Semite.\" \"Jewish people have suffered as much if not more from this global manipulation as anyone else,\" agreed David. \"Far from being the perpetuators of it, they are massive victims of it. And, in terms of racism, my own daughter's boyfriend is himself black.\" \"You've changed my life,\" said another fan. \"I used to be a sheep, I used to be like them, but you've changed my life.\" On Thursday, the anti-Icke camp suffered a public humiliation. VTV, Vancouver's popular local television station, decided to ignore the coalition's request to cancel David's scheduled TV appearance. Instead, it put him on live - head to head with an eminent local psychology professor called Bill Bierstein: Host: \"Professor, why do you think Mr Icke has such a following when a lot of people would think his ideas are out of this world?\" David (turning furiously to host): \"What research have you done on that? Nothing! Nothing! Nonsense!\" Professor: \"People like to enchant themselves. They want there to be grand conspiracies by superpowerful beings, rather than just a bunch of mistakes made by decent people . . .\" David: \"Professor!(To host) Is he going to go on forever?\" Host: \"Let's get Mr Icke to respond to that.\" David: \"Professor, did you major in patronising the people of British Columbia?\" Professor: \"Well, there's no need for insulting comments.\" David: \"Okay, tell me about the Bilderberg Group.\" Host (interrupting): \"Let's talk about why . . .\" David (thunderously): \"Don't tell me what I'm going to say. Tell me about the Bilderberg Group!\" Host (listening anxiously into her earpiece): \"Mr Icke, we don't want to talk about that right now. Let's talk about . . .\" David (a knowing smile): \"I'm sure you don't!\" Host: \"Why are Jewish groups calling you anti-Semitic?\" David: \"Because I'm getting too close to the truth.\" Professor (laughing): \"Don't get into these convoluted paranoid fantasies that people are trying to shut you up . . .\" This was, under the circumstances, the wrong thing to say. David could be accused of many things, but fantasising that he was being censored was not one of them. David smiled a little, and then he went in for the kill. David: \"I have had three major interviews pulled this week. I've had book signings cancelled. You wanna read the papers a bit more, mate! There Are Lizards And There Are Lizards.\" The Professor faltered. Professor: \"Well, uh, if you have nothing better to do than to insult me, then I'm sorry for your process of thought . . .\" But it was over. The professor had blown it. In the days that followed this TV debate, some of the coalition began privately admitting to me that the whole thing was beginning to backfire. David Icke's fans were not, by and large, anti-Semites. It was more alarming than that. They were, in fact, the coalition's core constituents - liberals and anti-racists and left-wingers concerned with the perils of global capitalism. These people were beginning to look upon the coalition as the villains, as the hidden hand, as \"them\". \u00a9 Jon Ronson, 2001.

They include the Argentine generals Jorge Videla, Roberto Viola, Emilio Massera, Leopoldo Galtieri, Guillermo Suarez Mason, the reports said. All are suspected of multiple murder. The Rome public prosecutor, Giancarlo Capaldo, confirmed the existence of the investigation in a radio interview yesterday, saying he expected to be in a position within the next few months to decide who should be tried. His office was seeking to clarify which of various political and military levels were responsible for the disappearance of the Italian citizens, Mr Capaldo said. He is reported to have based his investigation, at least in part, on the \"Horror Archives\" found near the Paraguayan capital Asuncion in 1992. The documents detail kidnapping, torture and killing of thousands of Latin American leftwingers under the auspices of Operation Condor, a pact which enabled the secret services of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay to pursue their political enemies abroad. Italian magistrates have opened four investigations into the activities of Latin American death squads. In December a Rome assize court sentenced General Suarez Mason in absentia to life imprisonment for his role in the disappearance of seven Italian citizens. The Italian president, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, on a state visit to Argentina, has met human rights campaigners. He told them: \"These are atrocities that dishonour the human race and everything possible must be done to arrive at the truth.\" Cristina Mihura, an Italian whose husband, Bernardo Arnone, was kidnapped in Buenos Aires by the Uruguayan security services and subsequently killed, said: \"A lot of people think that a sentence in absentia has no value. \"I don't consider it has only symbolic value.

      "body": "<p>In the opinion of a new friend, the actor Norman Rodway, who has died aged 72 following a stroke, was \"a bit of a rascal in the nicest possible way - the only little boy I know who is over 70\".</p> <p>On stage, on television and on the big screen, he was often a professional Irishman, one who could play the gnarled Captain Jack Boyle in Sean O'Casey's Juno And The Paycock, alongside Judi Dench, without anyone questioning his Irishness. Indeed, one of his first parts in London was the hero of James Joyce's Stephen D, a pot-pourri of Joyce's writings in which Rodway was well able to suggest the tensions existing in a Catholic Irishman half wanting to break free of his past.</p> <p>In fact, he was born neither Catholic nor Irish, but was the son of a middle-class English father whose firm happened to send him to a post in Dublin just prior to his birth. His \"Irishness\" could nevertheless sometimes complicate things for his agent Scott Marshall when finding him non-Irish parts.</p> <p>At Dublin high school, the youthful Rodway made his debut in Gilbert and Sullivan's Iolanthe, singing soprano. The following year, he appeared in a leading part in The Gondoliers, as a dressed-to-kill girl in black wig, crimson lipstick, heavy mascara and a 44-inch bust. This brought him his first encore at the end of the first act. By now, he knew that he wanted the stage to be his career.</p> <p>Any impression of effeminacy that his soprano roles might have fostered at school was undercut by the fact that Rodway also starred as cricket captain, with top batting and bowling averages. His father had two private enthusiasms - cricket and opera - and had seen to it that his son was liberally exposed to both. At the age of nine, Rodway remembered practising his batting strokes against his father's bowling in their back garden at Marhahide, after which they went to his father's study to listen to opera on the radio.</p> <p>Cricket, and any branch of theatre, were to remain his enthusiasms, and his short, stocky frame, lantern jaw and piercing eyes were to make him especially adept at playing rascally or threatening parts, from Richard III, for the Royal Shakespeare Company, to Hitler, in the television psycho-drama The Empty Mirror, in which the dictator survived the war and had to face his crimes.</p> <p>After winning a scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin, where he took an honours degree in classics, Rodway spent a year teaching, a year lecturing, and even a very short time in the cost accountancy department of Guinness. While enduring these mundane ways of earning a living, he was also acting on a semi-professional basis in Dublin, where the line between professional and amateur tended to be more flexible than in Britain.</p> <p>In 1953, he appeared in the first production by the newly-formed Globe Theatre Company, and was soon running the group with Jack McGowran and Godfrey Quigley, until they hit the financial skids eight years later. Fortunately, he had not severed all contact with London, where both his parents came from. He appeared in a Royal Court Theatre production of Sean O'Casey's Cock-A-Doodle Dandy and, in 1963, settled in the capital permanently.</p> <p>New things were happening in British theatre, and one of the people making them happen was John Neville, who ran the new Nottingham Playhouse and who invited Rodway to appear as Lopakin in his production of The Cherry Orchard.

      "bodyText": "In the opinion of a new friend, the actor Norman Rodway, who has died aged 72 following a stroke, was \"a bit of a rascal in the nicest possible way - the only little boy I know who is over 70\". On stage, on television and on the big screen, he was often a professional Irishman, one who could play the gnarled Captain Jack Boyle in Sean O'Casey's Juno And The Paycock, alongside Judi Dench, without anyone questioning his Irishness. Indeed, one of his first parts in London was the hero of James Joyce's Stephen D, a pot-pourri of Joyce's writings in which Rodway was well able to suggest the tensions existing in a Catholic Irishman half wanting to break free of his past. In fact, he was born neither Catholic nor Irish, but was the son of a middle-class English father whose firm happened to send him to a post in Dublin just prior to his birth. His \"Irishness\" could nevertheless sometimes complicate things for his agent Scott Marshall when finding him non-Irish parts. At Dublin high school, the youthful Rodway made his debut in Gilbert and Sullivan's Iolanthe, singing soprano. The following year, he appeared in a leading part in The Gondoliers, as a dressed-to-kill girl in black wig, crimson lipstick, heavy mascara and a 44-inch bust. This brought him his first encore at the end of the first act. By now, he knew that he wanted the stage to be his career. Any impression of effeminacy that his soprano roles might have fostered at school was undercut by the fact that Rodway also starred as cricket captain, with top batting and bowling averages. His father had two private enthusiasms - cricket and opera - and had seen to it that his son was liberally exposed to both. At the age of nine, Rodway remembered practising his batting strokes against his father's bowling in their back garden at Marhahide, after which they went to his father's study to listen to opera on the radio. Cricket, and any branch of theatre, were to remain his enthusiasms, and his short, stocky frame, lantern jaw and piercing eyes were to make him especially adept at playing rascally or threatening parts, from Richard III, for the Royal Shakespeare Company, to Hitler, in the television psycho-drama The Empty Mirror, in which the dictator survived the war and had to face his crimes. After winning a scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin, where he took an honours degree in classics, Rodway spent a year teaching, a year lecturing, and even a very short time in the cost accountancy department of Guinness. While enduring these mundane ways of earning a living, he was also acting on a semi-professional basis in Dublin, where the line between professional and amateur tended to be more flexible than in Britain. In 1953, he appeared in the first production by the newly-formed Globe Theatre Company, and was soon running the group with Jack McGowran and Godfrey Quigley, until they hit the financial skids eight years later. Fortunately, he had not severed all contact with London, where both his parents came from. He appeared in a Royal Court Theatre production of Sean O'Casey's Cock-A-Doodle Dandy and, in 1963, settled in the capital permanently. New things were happening in British theatre, and one of the people making them happen was John Neville, who ran the new Nottingham Playhouse and who invited Rodway to appear as Lopakin in his production of The Cherry Orchard. Three years later, Rodway joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, the beginning of a long association that saw his larger-than-life persona being used to best advantage. After seeing the Laurence Olivier film version of Richard III 10 times, and watching Ian Holm on stage five times, Rodway took the leading role in Terry Hands's 1970 production with such force that one critic commented that his performance, crowning a recent series of grotesque roles, was directly satanic - a spirit of evil driven on his course by self-loathing and, in particular, by loathing for his own body. \"He is as ridiculous as he is villainous, and never more so than when he claps an outsize crown on that shaven bullet head.\" Rodway's flare for arresting effects was perhaps better suited to the stage than to the cinema, but he appeared in many varying roles on the big screen, and even survived playing Hotspur in Chimes At Midnight (1966), in which Orson Welles both directed and played a Falstaff extracted from several Shakespeare plays. Rodway noticed that as shooting went on, Welles's part got bigger and bigger, while his own got smaller and smaller.

The following year, as if paying tribute to his own stamina, Rodway appeared with Welles again, this time in I'll Never Forget What's 'Is Name, with director Michael Winner on hand to prune the less acceptable parts of Welles's ego.

He made more than 300 broadcasts for BBC radio, including Brian Friel's The Faith Healer, for which he won the 1980 Pye Radio Award for Best Actor. Rodway was married four times, first to the actress Pauline Delany, then to the casting director Mary Sellway, and thirdly to the photographer Sarah Fitzgerald, by whom he had a daughter Bianca. She survives him, as does his fourth wife, Jane, whom he married in 1991.

      "bodyText": "China's run of alarming catastrophes continued yesterday when a series of explosions ripped through the northern city of Shijiazhuang. Four pre-dawn blasts in an hour hit separate residential blocks, two of them near state-owned cotton mills, prompting speculation that they had been deliberately caused. The Chinese official news agency said that 18 people were reported dead, but a Hong Kong-based human rights group claimed the number was as high as 200 and likely to rise. A provincial official denied that, telling AFP: \"It could be a little higher than 18, but not 200.\" A cotton factory official said only four of the 10 cotton mills were still operating. Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province, is a centre of China's dwindling cotton industry, which has shed hundreds of thousands of workers. Residents told Reuters that riot police were patrolling the area around the blast sites and streets were sealed off. The blasts occurred 10 days after dozens of children were killed by an explosion in a school in southern China. On Thursday the prime minister, Zhu Rongji apologised for his government's failure to prevent such accidents and told local leaders they could be punished for negligence. If the Shijiazhuang explosions are attributed to disgruntled former workers it will open a new area of concern for the government, which is acutely sensitive to the dangers of social unrest. Mr Zhu has promised to cushion the impact of unemployment by improving social welfare provision and creating new jobs. But urban China is becoming accustomed to frequent angry demonstrations by workers who have been paid off or put on reduced wages. In spite of strict regulations, industrial explosives are easily obtained in the countryside, where small-scale and often illegal mining is widespread. The first explosion in Shijiazhuang almost demolished a five-storey hostel for workers and their families at the No 3 cotton mill. About 15 minutes later, a similar hostel was hit at the No 1 cotton mill near by. They were followed by blasts at a residential block owned by the railway company and another near the Hebei broadcasting university. Attempts by aggrieved workers to organise independent protest are often dealt with severely. Yesterday Human Rights Watch released details of the case of a labour organiser, Li Jiaqing, in neighbouring Henan province who organised protests at the defunct Zhengzhou paper mill, alleging that the managers tried to siphon off its assets. Last month Mr Li was tried on charges of \"gathering a crowd to disrupt social order\" and \"disturbing production\". \"The vulnerability of workers is actually increasing, particularly in state-run enterprises\", a Human Rights Watch researcher, Jan van der Made, said. \"They're caught in a squeeze, facing massive plant closures and layoffs.\" China ratified the international convention on economic, social and cultural rights last month, but entered reservations on some labour rights provisions.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Is Opec back in the driving seat? The cartel has had remarkable success in fine-tuning oil prices since it announced its policy of targeting an average price of $25 a barrel for its crude. So far this year, the Opec crude basket has averaged $24.65. </p> <p>After the rollercoaster ride of the last few years, which saw prices collapsing to below $10 a barrel in 1998 and then rising to nearly $35 a barrel last summer, the cartel's new approach has been welcomed in western capitals. </p> <p>But peace in the oil market never lasts for long. This weekend's production cut has alarmed the EU, which believes it is badly timed in view of the present turbulence in world markets. Forecasting is always a mug's game - and particularly now, when the global impact of the US slowdown is still unclear. </p> <p>Moreover, the cartel's success in controlling prices has been based on an unusual level of political harmony between the big three producers, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran. Cheating by members seems to be less of a problem, although Iraq's decision to withhold oil in protest at western sanctions is giving the cartel extra leeway. Should Iraq resume exporting at full capacity, Opec could once again be riven by infighting. </p> <p>In the short term yesterday's production cuts will send prices higher. But the longer term is more uncertain. The cartel has added to pressures on the global economy by raising energy prices at such a sensitive moment. If the economy collapses, they will pay the price. </p> <p><strong> Penalty shot </strong><br> </p> <p>The ability of the glorious and historic Equitable Life Assurance Society to both irritate its policyholders and damage the name of the wider fund management industry knows no bounds. </p> <p>Yesterday, it cited the recent market shake-out as an excuse for raising from 10% to 15% the \"financial adjustment\" - i.e. penalty - imposed on customers who want to get their own money out of this incompetent institution. </p> <p>The FTSE 100 has fallen 9% since December 8, when Equitable had to admit effective insolvency and was forced to close its doors to new business, having lost its attempt to deny holders of guaranteed annuity policies the investment terms promised. Equitable now argues that, since with-profits policies are \"smoothed\" over time, the value of a policy may from time to time exceed the underlying investment value. So letting policyholders flee while the overall market is low might penalise policyholders who stay in. </p> <p>Back in December, when the balloon went up, Equitable said it was switching its funds from the equity market into less risky assets such as gilts so as to avoid just this sort of calamity. But we now learn that the switch was halted when Halifax arrived with its rescue bid. Equitable thought it was business as usual - which it clearly was not. </p> <p>Another worrying aspect here is that Equitable feels it has to take such emergency action in the wake of the greatest equity bull market on record - especially when, by its own admission, policy surrenders have halved over recent weeks. This is further evidence that, having sailed too close to the wind in the past, this society is still struggling to get a grip in the present. </p> <p>Nobody should forget - especially the regulators - that Equitable is still holding \u00a326bn of the public's money. The move to hike withdrawal penalties smacks of fresh panic. </p> <p><strong> On the ball? </strong><br> </p> <p> Daniel Levy, the chief executive of leisure group Enic, is developing a reputation as something of an enigma. </p> <p>Having walked away from bids for Wembley plc and sports betting firms Victor Chandler International and Sporting Index, the Arsenal season ticket-holder has finally landed himself the chairmanship of arch rival Tottenham Hotspur - just as shares in football clubs have reached a nadir. </p> <p>Yesterday, less than a month after taking charge and just three weeks before the club's hugely important semi-final against - yes, Arsenal - Mr Levy fired team manager George Graham for al legedly blabbing confidential details about Tottenham's finances to the press. </p> <p>Mr Levy has said he is trying to bring a bit of commercial discipline to the club, but if yesterday's action really was spurred by a simple bust-up over a leak, it points to a worrying lack of understanding about the game and its money. </p> <p>Leaks and gossip are a way of life. Business is more often conducted through the back pages of the tabloids than in the quiet of the boardroom. </p> <p>For the notoriously publicity shy Mr Levy, that could leave a bitter taste. But swallow it he must, because he needs this deal to work. Enic's shares stand at less than a fifth of the level they touched a year ago. Shareholders are getting impatient. </p> <p>Unless things improve soon, his best bet would be to take the company private. Then at least he might have some chance of conducting his battles beyond the media's glare.</p>",

After the rollercoaster ride of the last few years, which saw prices collapsing to below $10 a barrel in 1998 and then rising to nearly $35 a barrel last summer, the cartel's new approach has been welcomed in western capitals. But peace in the oil market never lasts for long. This weekend's production cut has alarmed the EU, which believes it is badly timed in view of the present turbulence in world markets. Forecasting is always a mug's game - and particularly now, when the global impact of the US slowdown is still unclear. Moreover, the cartel's success in controlling prices has been based on an unusual level of political harmony between the big three producers, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran. Cheating by members seems to be less of a problem, although Iraq's decision to withhold oil in protest at western sanctions is giving the cartel extra leeway. Should Iraq resume exporting at full capacity, Opec could once again be riven by infighting. In the short term yesterday's production cuts will send prices higher. But the longer term is more uncertain. The cartel has added to pressures on the global economy by raising energy prices at such a sensitive moment. If the economy collapses, they will pay the price. Penalty shot The ability of the glorious and historic Equitable Life Assurance Society to both irritate its policyholders and damage the name of the wider fund management industry knows no bounds. Yesterday, it cited the recent market shake-out as an excuse for raising from 10% to 15% the \"financial adjustment\" - i.e. penalty - imposed on customers who want to get their own money out of this incompetent institution. The FTSE 100 has fallen 9% since December 8, when Equitable had to admit effective insolvency and was forced to close its doors to new business, having lost its attempt to deny holders of guaranteed annuity policies the investment terms promised. Equitable now argues that, since with-profits policies are \"smoothed\" over time, the value of a policy may from time to time exceed the underlying investment value. So letting policyholders flee while the overall market is low might penalise policyholders who stay in. Back in December, when the balloon went up, Equitable said it was switching its funds from the equity market into less risky assets such as gilts so as to avoid just this sort of calamity. But we now learn that the switch was halted when Halifax arrived with its rescue bid. Equitable thought it was business as usual - which it clearly was not. Another worrying aspect here is that Equitable feels it has to take such emergency action in the wake of the greatest equity bull market on record - especially when, by its own admission, policy surrenders have halved over recent weeks. This is further evidence that, having sailed too close to the wind in the past, this society is still struggling to get a grip in the present. Nobody should forget - especially the regulators - that Equitable is still holding \u00a326bn of the public's money. The move to hike withdrawal penalties smacks of fresh panic. On the ball? Daniel Levy, the chief executive of leisure group Enic, is developing a reputation as something of an enigma. Having walked away from bids for Wembley plc and sports betting firms Victor Chandler International and Sporting Index, the Arsenal season ticket-holder has finally landed himself the chairmanship of arch rival Tottenham Hotspur - just as shares in football clubs have reached a nadir. Yesterday, less than a month after taking charge and just three weeks before the club's hugely important semi-final against - yes, Arsenal - Mr Levy fired team manager George Graham for al legedly blabbing confidential details about Tottenham's finances to the press. Mr Levy has said he is trying to bring a bit of commercial discipline to the club, but if yesterday's action really was spurred by a simple bust-up over a leak, it points to a worrying lack of understanding about the game and its money. Leaks and gossip are a way of life. Business is more often conducted through the back pages of the tabloids than in the quiet of the boardroom. For the notoriously publicity shy Mr Levy, that could leave a bitter taste. But swallow it he must, because he needs this deal to work. Enic's shares stand at less than a fifth of the level they touched a year ago. Shareholders are getting impatient. Unless things improve soon, his best bet would be to take the company private. Then at least he might have some chance of conducting his battles beyond the media's glare.",

      "body": "<p>Enemy At The Gates, a new film about the battle of Stalingrad, had its London premiere last night. I saw it earlier in the week at a charity performance, and would not recommend it. Antony Beevor, the author of a bestselling book about the legendary German-Soviet battle, has complained in a newspaper about the film's indifference to historical accuracy. Its plot centres around a duel between a Russian and a German sniper that Beevor says never took place. Beevor also objects to a supposed romance between the Russian sniper (played by Jude Law) and a Russian Jewish girl (played by Rachel Weisz), who has taken up sniping at the enemy, too, in revenge for the murder of her parents by German soldiers. Beevor admits that such a love affair could have happened, but complains that, in the film, \"it obstructs any serious examination of the basically psychotic character required in an outstanding sniper\".</p> <p> I do not share these objections. By Hollywood standards, it is not an inaccurate film. The Russian sniper, Vassili Zaitsev, did exist, and really was turned into a hero by the Soviet propaganda machine, which liked his good looks and humble background as a shepherd boy from the Urals. The sharp-shooting German major dispatched from Berlin to eliminate this popular Soviet icon may not have existed, but so what? His participation in the person of an excellent actor, Ed Harris, helped make the film bearable. Without him and his tense duel with Law, who was only occasionally distracted by his passion for the lady sniper, the film would have sunk into a mire of chaos and futility.</p> <p> For this very reason, Beevor's book, Stalingrad, was difficult to read. In its rigorous adherence to historical accuracy, it portrayed the German invasion of Russia, ending with defeat at Stalingrad in 1943, in all its real-life depravity and squalor. The film does this, too, when not focusing on its central human drama. Costing around \u00a360m, it is reportedly the most expensive film ever made in Europe. And much of that money has been spent on conveying as realistically as possible the horrors of war.</p> <p> Beevor notes in his article that \"there has been a great leap forward in special effects and computer-generated imagery\" that \"can create realistic battle footage unimaginable a decade ago\". But who wants \"realistic battle footage\" when this shows nothing but death, destruction and hideous savagery without the smallest moral justification? In a conflict between Stalin and Hitler, I find it impossible to care who wins.</p> <p> War films have lately become so horrific that they should be censored at least as rigorously as pornography. You would indeed have to be some kind of psychotic to enjoy all of the scenes from Enemy At The Gates. There are people who welcome the new realism as an antidote to cinema's past glorification of war, and I must admit that films such as this bring out the pacifist in me. But it is neither pleasant nor fruitful to dwell unduly on the barbaric aspects of mankind. </p> <p> The charity for which the screening was held is the World Monuments Fund, created in the 60s to \"safeguard the heritage of mankind by encouraging the conservation and preservation of culturally and historically significant works of art and architecture worldwide\". The choice of film was fortuitous. Stalingrad was destroyed, but there was never anything culturally or historically significant about it. The WMF would have viewed its ruin with equanimity. But it cares desperately about a more recent act of destruction: that by Afghanistan's Taliban rulers of the Great Buddhas of Bamiyan. </p> <p>These huge Buddhist statues, which survived bombardment by Genghis Khan 800 years ago, have been dynamited out of existence by the Muslim fundamentalists of the Taliban, who regard all statues as idolatrous. The WMF, in adding its voice to a worldwide chorus of protest, coined a new phrase, cultural terrorism: \"A new form of terrorism - cultural terrorism - is being unleashed against the world through the systematic destruction of ancient sculptures by Afghanistan's Taliban government,\" the WMF said. </p> <p>\"Cultural works represent humankind's highest aspirations. By violently destroying unique, irreplaceable works that have inspired people for millennia, they are attacking the fundamental belief that our shared cultural heritage unites us. The nations of the world must be prepared to combat this new form of terrorism that has surfaced in Afghanistan today.\" </p> <p>The Taliban are, indeed, attacking the idea that Afghanistan is united with the rest of the world by a \"shared cultural heritage\". They regard the fate of the statues as nobody's business but their own. Given that their actions have neither been directed against anybody else, nor linked to any kind of blackmail or extortion, it seems quite wrong in this instance to accuse them of \"terrorism\". The WMF, in summoning the nations of the world to prepare for combat, sounds rather more warlike than the Taliban are.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Enemy At The Gates, a new film about the battle of Stalingrad, had its London premiere last night. I saw it earlier in the week at a charity performance, and would not recommend it. Antony Beevor, the author of a bestselling book about the legendary German-Soviet battle, has complained in a newspaper about the film's indifference to historical accuracy. Its plot centres around a duel between a Russian and a German sniper that Beevor says never took place. Beevor also objects to a supposed romance between the Russian sniper (played by Jude Law) and a Russian Jewish girl (played by Rachel Weisz), who has taken up sniping at the enemy, too, in revenge for the murder of her parents by German soldiers. Beevor admits that such a love affair could have happened, but complains that, in the film, \"it obstructs any serious examination of the basically psychotic character required in an outstanding sniper\". I do not share these objections. By Hollywood standards, it is not an inaccurate film. The Russian sniper, Vassili Zaitsev, did exist, and really was turned into a hero by the Soviet propaganda machine, which liked his good looks and humble background as a shepherd boy from the Urals. The sharp-shooting German major dispatched from Berlin to eliminate this popular Soviet icon may not have existed, but so what? His participation in the person of an excellent actor, Ed Harris, helped make the film bearable. Without him and his tense duel with Law, who was only occasionally distracted by his passion for the lady sniper, the film would have sunk into a mire of chaos and futility. For this very reason, Beevor's book, Stalingrad, was difficult to read. In its rigorous adherence to historical accuracy, it portrayed the German invasion of Russia, ending with defeat at Stalingrad in 1943, in all its real-life depravity and squalor. The film does this, too, when not focusing on its central human drama. Costing around \u00a360m, it is reportedly the most expensive film ever made in Europe. And much of that money has been spent on conveying as realistically as possible the horrors of war. Beevor notes in his article that \"there has been a great leap forward in special effects and computer-generated imagery\" that \"can create realistic battle footage unimaginable a decade ago\". But who wants \"realistic battle footage\" when this shows nothing but death, destruction and hideous savagery without the smallest moral justification? In a conflict between Stalin and Hitler, I find it impossible to care who wins. War films have lately become so horrific that they should be censored at least as rigorously as pornography. You would indeed have to be some kind of psychotic to enjoy all of the scenes from Enemy At The Gates. There are people who welcome the new realism as an antidote to cinema's past glorification of war, and I must admit that films such as this bring out the pacifist in me. But it is neither pleasant nor fruitful to dwell unduly on the barbaric aspects of mankind. The charity for which the screening was held is the World Monuments Fund, created in the 60s to \"safeguard the heritage of mankind by encouraging the conservation and preservation of culturally and historically significant works of art and architecture worldwide\". The choice of film was fortuitous. Stalingrad was destroyed, but there was never anything culturally or historically significant about it. The WMF would have viewed its ruin with equanimity. But it cares desperately about a more recent act of destruction: that by Afghanistan's Taliban rulers of the Great Buddhas of Bamiyan. These huge Buddhist statues, which survived bombardment by Genghis Khan 800 years ago, have been dynamited out of existence by the Muslim fundamentalists of the Taliban, who regard all statues as idolatrous. The WMF, in adding its voice to a worldwide chorus of protest, coined a new phrase, cultural terrorism: \"A new form of terrorism - cultural terrorism - is being unleashed against the world through the systematic destruction of ancient sculptures by Afghanistan's Taliban government,\" the WMF said. \"Cultural works represent humankind's highest aspirations. By violently destroying unique, irreplaceable works that have inspired people for millennia, they are attacking the fundamental belief that our shared cultural heritage unites us. The nations of the world must be prepared to combat this new form of terrorism that has surfaced in Afghanistan today.\" The Taliban are, indeed, attacking the idea that Afghanistan is united with the rest of the world by a \"shared cultural heritage\". They regard the fate of the statues as nobody's business but their own. Given that their actions have neither been directed against anybody else, nor linked to any kind of blackmail or extortion, it seems quite wrong in this instance to accuse them of \"terrorism\". The WMF, in summoning the nations of the world to prepare for combat, sounds rather more warlike than the Taliban are.",

From the moment we meet him, one thing is clear: Mark is not lending-officer material. Perpetually stoned, generally unkempt, unable to maintain eye contact with adults, not especially articulate and a woefully ineffective handyman, Ruffalo has been everywhere from Alaska to Miami, and has not yet landed on his feet. His rap sheet includes a three-month stint in a Florida jail; most recently he has impregnated a teenage girl who then tried to take her own life. He also scowls a lot and bears a worrying resemblance to Erik Estrada, star of the 70s TV show CHiPs.

Linney is crushed to learn this, but she soon gets over it, as this is obviously not the first time Mr Useless has put the squeeze on her. Moreover, even though her brother is a stoner, a wastrel, a loser and very possibly a statutory rapist, Linney loves him dearly.

The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance occurs when Ruffalo takes his nephew to the trailer park to visit his long-lost white-trash father. The get-together does not go well; Ruffalo smashes his brother-in-law's face in, and ends up spending the night in jail. Culkin, holding out for someone like Prince Valiant or James Bond, steadfastly refuses to believe that he is related to such Grade-A swamp trash as his father, though he doesn't seem to have any trouble believing that he's related to his swamp-trash uncle.</p> <p>While Ruffalo is introducing his nephew to rural New York's coarse demi-monde, Linney is busy wrecking her own life. First she sleeps with her boss, a pernickety twit played by Matthew Broderick, who had the same role in Election. It does not help that Broderick's wife is six months pregnant. Nor that he is pernickety. Next she breaks up with her steady, a thoroughly decent sort played by John Tenney. Tenney's big mistake was in asking her to marry him. Via Linney's rebuff, the movie seems to be suggesting that Ruffalo is a carrier of the dreaded Jerk Virus, and that anyone with whom he comes into contact will immediately start engaging in prodigiously self-destructive behaviour. Either that, or Linney is a tramp.</p> <p>Linney, honoured with an Academy Award nomination for her work here, does a fine job as the harried mother of a whiny, obnoxious child and sister of a zonked low-life. But the movie itself is a bit slight. The message seems to be that children who undergo youthful traumas together will always feel a special bond that time and distance cannot rupture. The audience is therefore invited, and even expected, to feel sorry for Poor Little Brother, who cannot get over the hump emotionally. But at the same time, director Kenneth Lonergan (who wrote the screenplay for Analyze This) argues that there is a thin line between bank lending and drug addiction, and that if Linney is not careful she could end up going right down the tubes as well.</p> <p>Like the whimsical Chocolat, You Can Count On Me haughtily ridicules organised religion and relies heavily on an overbearing soundtrack to achieve emotional effects it cannot achieve through the camera or the people in front of it. It misuses Bach, a non-low-budget film composer if there ever was one, and overuses hillybilly rocker Steve Earle, whose haunting I Am Just A Pilgrim On This Road ends the film, laboriously hammering home the point that Ruffalo will always be a vagabond.</p> <p>More jarring still is Culkin's casting as Linney's son. Yet another assembly-line tyke from the Hollywood Charm School, it is fair to say that Culkin, at this early stage in his career, lacks range. He falls into the same category as Bruce Willis's delicate son in Unbreakable (who also played Joaquin Phoenix's delicate nephew in Gladiator) and Will Patton's maddeningly precocious daughter in Remember The Titans: porcelain dolls who could not possibly be genetically linked to anyone else in the film. If the movie industry can't come up with any better child actors than this, it should start using computer-generated kids.</p>",

But the movie itself is a bit slight. The message seems to be that children who undergo youthful traumas together will always feel a special bond that time and distance cannot rupture. The audience is therefore invited, and even expected, to feel sorry for Poor Little Brother, who cannot get over the hump emotionally. But at the same time, director Kenneth Lonergan (who wrote the screenplay for Analyze This) argues that there is a thin line between bank lending and drug addiction, and that if Linney is not careful she could end up going right down the tubes as well. Like the whimsical Chocolat, You Can Count On Me haughtily ridicules organised religion and relies heavily on an overbearing soundtrack to achieve emotional effects it cannot achieve through the camera or the people in front of it. It misuses Bach, a non-low-budget film composer if there ever was one, and overuses hillybilly rocker Steve Earle, whose haunting I Am Just A Pilgrim On This Road ends the film, laboriously hammering home the point that Ruffalo will always be a vagabond. More jarring still is Culkin's casting as Linney's son. Yet another assembly-line tyke from the Hollywood Charm School, it is fair to say that Culkin, at this early stage in his career, lacks range. He falls into the same category as Bruce Willis's delicate son in Unbreakable (who also played Joaquin Phoenix's delicate nephew in Gladiator) and Will Patton's maddeningly precocious daughter in Remember The Titans: porcelain dolls who could not possibly be genetically linked to anyone else in the film. If the movie industry can't come up with any better child actors than this, it should start using computer-generated kids.",

Sandra Bullock stars as daggy FBI agent Gracie Hart - a woman plagued by open pores, a monobrow and absolutely no kind of depilatory regime to speak of - who is required to go undercover as a contestant at a Miss United States beauty pageant in order to foil a terrorist plot. To make her guise more convincing, styling supremo Michael Caine is drafted in to take her dagginess in hand, and wax and tweeze her into a vision of fragrant, groomed loveliness. It is, in many respects, the Hollywood equivalent of Stephen Tompkinson getting greasier and more unkempt than usual in an effort to merge convincingly with a gang of marauding fascist porn peddlers for a BBC1 Crime Double. </p> <p>Yet despite this uninspiring-sounding premise, Miss Congeniality has already taken $100m in the US and will do big business here. Not because it fits snugly into that optimistic, frolicky rom-com spring flick niche, and will subsequently make solid in-flight entertainment fodder. Not even because it features that defining example of the modern freak show, the American beauty pageant. But because it has as its central device a makeover. An epic makeover. A makeover under pressure - Gracie has to be transformed from fumbling, stumbling plainness into the epitome of prom queen perk in a mere 48 hours. A makeover realised against the makeoveree's will - Gracie claims at one point that she doesn't know what to do with a bikini. A makeover, moreover, performed in the name of combating terrorism. </p> <p>The cinema-frequenting, soap-watching, department store beauty counter-stalking element of society have a terrible passion for the makeover. I know this, because I am amongst them. I have absolutely no capacity for makeover fatigue. I am eternally enchanted by the possibility that a crack collective of hairdressers, stylists, personal trainers and nail technicians might transform me - or my friends, or some fictional character - for the better, help us realise a physical potential we never even dreamed we possessed. It is my opinion that makeovers (and their hipper, high-fashion equivalents, the \"reinvention\") are an essential dynamic of our time. A recent GMTV report estimated that some 87% of us are on a constant mission to improve our physical appearance. Frankly, I was staggered to learn that 13% of people aren't. Vicarious or first-hand, in literature, on telly, between the print-sticky pages of Chat, makeovers obsess, inspire and motivate us. The makeover is about changing for the better, the prettier, the glossier. It's about changing from the outside out. </p> <p>Popular culture doesn't let us ever give up hope that, one day, our makeover will come. That's one of the truly significant functions it performs. And the current zeitgeist is, if anything, more preoccupied with makeover propaganda than ever. A fortnight ago, Martine McCutcheon opened as Eliza Doolittle in the National Theatre's revival of My Fair Lady, the musical version of Pygmalion - the original makeover tale. McCutcheon is an appropriate choice of heroine, given that many of us have been fixated by her real-life transformation from blowsy post-Tiffany power-ballad peddler to svelte, gamine-haired wearer of one-shoulder glitter tops. A makeover in motion is Martine. Similarly, when Geri Halliwell took to the stage at the Brits, all buffed and toned, honey-golden and prettily peroxide, we were all allowed an insight into what a makeover can do for the average saggy-jowled, badly dyed, sluttily dressed one-time girl band hellcat. </p> <p>Two major magazine launches in the space of six weeks also championed the individual's right to reinvent. Time Warners' InStyle, which is entirely dedicated to teaching the nation to transform itself in the image of Gwyneth/Angelina/Sarah Jessica Parker, and Conde Nast's Glamour, whose brief may be broader, but whose cover lines are all: \"Oscar Worthy Hair: Hollywood styles to inspire your new look\", and \"Victoria Beckham writes: My 10 unbreakable style rules\". The celebrity makeover is clearly considered the major readership draw. The anti-makeover, coincidentally, is also proving quite a talking point. Renee Zellweger's intensive programme of un-grooming and weight gain for the Bridget Jones role has attracted a level of public attention which testifies to that. </p> <p>If I have learned anything from the last 20 years of consciously consuming popular culture, then it's this: there is a makeover to suit every moment, every agenda, every prospective lover, and only a fool doesn't take this on board. In Grease, Sandy shows us that, to snare the wayward bad boy, you must first dress like a slapper. Plain Jane Super Brain of Neighbours fame (who was a makeover waiting to happen from her very earliest scenes, and who, accordingly, brought to the makeover genre a thrilling sense of destiny realised) demonstrated that it is important to be as pretty as you possibly can be for its own sake. Ally Sheedy's character in The Breakfast Club taught us that 30 minutes in a broom cupboard with Molly Ringwald and her lip liner can transform anyone from dandruff-shaking school pariah to essential in-crowd component. And Julia Roberts' Pretty Woman discovered that, by losing the PVC mini and the obvious wig, gaining some Versace and a French pleat, social elevation, an escape from a vice-filled life and the opportunity to diss shop assistants can be yours. That's without even touching on Melanie Griffiths' makeover in Working Girl (from New Jersey white trash to power-dressing Manhattan exec), and Rachel Leigh Cook's geek-to-homecoming-queen manoeuvre in She's All That. </p> <p>And yet, and yet - the makeover movie genre is clearly not exhausted. Box-office takings and viewing figures confirm that. There are infinite unexplored variations on this theme trembling in the wings, and crowds of makeover acionados waiting, breathless, for their next fix. </p> <p>Which is just as it should be. Because if makeover obsession is beginning to seem like a uniquely inconsequential girlie concern, think again. Quite apart from the kergillions of men who furtively long to be made over too, not to mention those that publicly go for it (Robbie Williams, David Beckham, Nicky Haslam), makeovers also perform a social and financial function. They power our economy, keep us spending in the vague hope that this moisturiser coupled with that shirt will equal makeover heaven. They provide us with a common end, a joint sense of purpose, and a conversation point that can unite strangers in bus queues. </p> <p>Ultimately, makeovers give us hope for a better-styled tomorrow. Now, if someone would be so kind as to make this clear to The Makeover That Never Quite Happened - more widely known as Anna in Hollyoaks, sole remaining female brunette cast member who staunchly refuses to ditch her daughter-of-a-vicar aesthetic definitively, even though she's clearly a honey underneath it all - I would be most grateful. </p> <p>Miss Congeniality is out on Friday</p>",

The broadsheet apologists were certainly silly enough. All those soft boys (and the usual sad-sack suck-up contingent of girls who can't get boyfriends and will do anything to make men like them), educated beyond all instinct and honesty, piping on about how the Angry Blond was the best thing since Shakespeare. In truth, of course, it was the Dr Johnson line about a woman preaching being like a dog walking on its hind legs; the fact that it could do it was impressive enough, never mind whether it did it well! And to the chattering, would-be splattering class boys whose one experience of the American working class was bunking off lectures to watch Jerry Springer, the idea that a piece of white trash could string three words together - even if they were faggot, bitch and dick - was obviously deeply impressive. </p> <p>But you expect people who didn't leave school until they were 24 to be pretty naive and credulous. What I can't get over is how silly the Sisters were, myself included - and we're so much smarter than the aesthetes, so should have known better. Yet we ran around throwing up our hands in horror and having a good old fit of the Victorian vapours, acting for all the world like the girls out of the Georgy Porgy nursery rhyme: \"Cussed the girls and made them cry,\" indeed. Looking back, why in the world did we give any credence whatsoever to the views of a man who's so dumb that he didn't know Elton John was gay, such a wimp that he sleeps with the light on and such a square that, given all the Cornucopian horn of exotic drugs that must be available to him, he's reported to have ended up addicted to a prescription drug, Vicodin, that is principally used by Americans to fight period pains? Was he really worth all those acres of protesting print? Wasn't it just a little like getting upset over, say, something untoward said by Elmer Fudd? </p> <p>The sad fact is that we Sisters thought we knew it all, and therefore ignored the top piece of advice that our mothers gave us all those years ago as we bleated about our woes re the Big Playground: sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me! Over the years, this prime bit of wisdom evades us; only young women, being closer to it, bear it in mind. And only young women had the right attitude to Eminem, be it Christina and Britney not dignifying his smutty slander with a response; the 13- to 16-year-old girls, who made up the majority of his British audience, giggling that they didn't pay any attention to the words, they just thought he was so cute; or the ever-brilliant Evening Standard journalist Zoe Williams, who stated the absolute obvious - don't let him see you're looking, girls, he just wants to get a reaction. Of all the scribbling sisters, only young Zoe saw Eminem for what he is: the modern equivalent of the protagonists of the Flanders &amp; Swann song, \"Ma's out, Pa's out - let's talk rude: pee, po, belly, bum, drawers.\" </p> <p>Why on earth did we mind what Eminem said about women? Who cares? If only the Welsh had learned from our mistake. Without doubt the Welsh are the sexiest, best-looking and cleverest people in Europe, yet time and time again they let ignorant munters like Anne Robinson, AA Gill and Jeremy Clarkson wind them up. Yet just one look at any of this trio - Robinson with her sour little mug, Gill with a voice that makes me sound like Mariella Frostrup, or Clarkson, who single-handedly made blue jeans beyond the pale to youth, such is his repulsiveness - and you can tell immediately why they don't like the Welsh. Their bitching tells us nothing about the Welsh, and everything about them. </p> <p>I have a real problem with the idea of caring what strangers think about you. Or rather, not a problem at all, because I don't. Apart from my talent and my big green eyes, I am sure that being born with this advantage has been the making of me, and for years I believed that when people did appear to care whether people approved of them or not, they were putting it on. Obviously you care about what the people you love think of you - but anyone else? Why? Performers in particular, who need the world to love them, strike me as being very strange people. We hear a lot about the madness of those who stalk the famous, but what about the insanity of people who court mass love? And they don't get any wiser as they get older, either. The other day Steven Berkoff said that, as he put out \"so much love\" in his plays (would that be \"Shit\", \"Piss\" or \"Fuck\", the one with all this love in it, I wonder?), he felt that he had a right to demand love back from the public. How much weirder is it to offer love to strangers, as stalkers do, than it is to demand it from strangers, as performers do? Seems a match made in heaven to me. </p> <p> But while men may demand approval, women seek it desperately, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better. In fact, as women gain more power in the public realm, they seem hell-bent on sabotaging themselves in their private lives. The Bridget Jones phenomenon, \"Does my bum look big in this?\", the fact that 90% of women are \"unhappy\" with their bodies, the rise in casual \"lunchtime\" cosmetic surgery: all these indicate a people very ill at ease in their own skin. Worse, it is widely accepted that such neurosis is loveable, attractive even, and that imperviousness to the opinions of others is somewhat monstrous in a woman. \"What woman is pleased with her looks?\" said the actress Zoe Wanamaker recently. \"If they are, I wouldn't want to know them.\" </p> <p>But why wouldn't one want to have friends who were comfortable and content with themselves? When did discontent and insecurity become the norm? Forget Bridget Jones. The fictional heroine who most depended on the approval and kindness of strangers was Blanche DuBois. And look how she turned out.</p>",

The other day Steven Berkoff said that, as he put out \"so much love\" in his plays (would that be \"Shit\", \"Piss\" or \"Fuck\", the one with all this love in it, I wonder?), he felt that he had a right to demand love back from the public. How much weirder is it to offer love to strangers, as stalkers do, than it is to demand it from strangers, as performers do? Seems a match made in heaven to me. But while men may demand approval, women seek it desperately, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better. In fact, as women gain more power in the public realm, they seem hell-bent on sabotaging themselves in their private lives. The Bridget Jones phenomenon, \"Does my bum look big in this?\", the fact that 90% of women are \"unhappy\" with their bodies, the rise in casual \"lunchtime\" cosmetic surgery: all these indicate a people very ill at ease in their own skin. Worse, it is widely accepted that such neurosis is loveable, attractive even, and that imperviousness to the opinions of others is somewhat monstrous in a woman. \"What woman is pleased with her looks?\" said the actress Zoe Wanamaker recently. \"If they are, I wouldn't want to know them.\" But why wouldn't one want to have friends who were comfortable and content with themselves? When did discontent and insecurity become the norm? Forget Bridget Jones. The fictional heroine who most depended on the approval and kindness of strangers was Blanche DuBois. And look how she turned out.",

And when we are in the grips of the craze we want to know everything there is to be known about a plant - how it appears in every variant, what can be done with it, what will make it happy. When the craze subsides, it may be that we can begin to think the unthinkable: to admit, for instance, that we are going to have to live without azaleas, or cut down on our hydrangea habit. </p> <p>Something will normally survive these crazes, and whatever it is that survives them - whether it is a single species or a group of plants - should take its place among our permanent affections.

And furthermore, so it seemed to me, there should be lilies in abundance. Obviously roses, irises and lilies were the essential constituents of a flower garden. </p> <p>So it seemed to me, and so it still seems! But it is years since we added a rose to the mixture, or even looked seriously at the rose catalogues. Irises and lilies are a different matter, for we keep adding to their number and varying the approach to growing them: sometimes they have been scattered to all corners of the garden, sometimes grouped together, particularly if they are being grown to be cut. </p> <p>Propagation by seed is not the first consideration in either case, although given a little patience and space, and given the desire for a large number of lilies, some species are worth growing in this way. That great star of the genus Lilium regale (no 67) sows itself around in my garden to a modest degree, but in a manner that seems to suggest that one would be foolish to throw away the ripe seed-heads.

The poppies have far more to offer - fragile though they may sometimes seem. That fragility is an illusion. The Spanish poppy (no 69) Papaver rupifragum , in what I call pale orange, may seem of feeble constitution, but it just hangs around the back door, returning year after year, looking after itself. We grow P sendtneri ( no 70) in paving: it is pure white and miniature, and it does not insist on its native limestone (or that altitude of 9,000ft which is sometimes inconvenient to arrange). </p> <p>The field poppy P rhoeas mentioned last week earns an honoured place in the garden in the strain called the Shirley poppy, which, to be what the Reverend William Wilks had in mind when he selected it, ought to be a single flower in white, pink or salmon. Modern versions delight in their doubleness. </p> <p>This kind of annual makes itself a perennial feature of the garden by reliably re-sowing its own patch, as does the tall, incomparable opium poppy, (no 71) P somniferum , which comes in so many forms, single and double. Black peony is one I would choose - almost at random. Nothing hangs on your decision, in choosing between the opium poppies. The foliage will all be the same handsome glaucous blue-green. The range of colours - from white through red, pink and purple - seems entirely appropriate to the plant.

Its popularity represents a further triumph for the colour orange, for orange is what it does best - a deeper, warmer orange than the Californian poppy, which I listed as no 4. </p> <p>The white version, and the intermediate pastel shade, and the yellow, are pleasant variants on the essential orange, the thing itself. This is a flower which astonishes us by being good for cutting, when you would think that it would wilt straight away.

Meconopsis cambrica , the yellow Welsh poppy (no 73), and its orange and scarlet variants, are self-seeders for shade; flowers that, like the Chelidonium (which is also a kind of poppy), are expected to get on with it, furnishing shady walks and gravel paths. I would rave about the blue Himalayan meconopsis , if I honestly - or plausibly - could claim to have grown it. Instead, on the blue theme, let me mention Corydalis linstowiana - for corydalis is often listed as a member of the Papaveraceae , an annual or biennial which has seeded itself under our roses, with pale blue flowers.

It's worth noting that the farmed turbot I have tried makes a considerably better argument for farmed fish than does the frightful salmon. I am hugely fond of artichokes, and though they're quite a chore to prepare, they more than pay you back for the effort in the eating.

Set aside to cool, then store in a sealed container: they keep very well for several days in the fridge.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6. Cut each artichoke into three slices, lay these on a roasting sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes, until beautifully browned with little flecks of black here and there. Set to one side, and keep warm.</p> <p>Next, make the gremolada garnish.

Lay the turbot slices on the plates, scatter a few slices of artichoke over the top, then strew with the gremolada and serve.</p> <p><b>Chicken liver pat\u00e9</b></p> <p>Hoummos last week, now this: I seem to be in nostalgic mood, with such recipes from way back that nowadays seem rarely to figure except in the supermarket chill cabinets and on the menus of a few retro-restaurants. Considering our adoration of roast chicken - not to mention those countless other dishes in which the fowl is reduced to unrecognisable pieces of boneless and skinless matter, and the sheer volume of these birds consumed here - it is quite extraordinary that there is very little or no reference to chicken livers in the British culinary repertory. The Italians cook them with pasta, the French put them in warm salads and terrines, and Jewish cookery boasts an exceptionally good chopped liver. Chicken livers make good kebabs, too. I have acquired a small collection of cherished pt\u00e9 recipes, of which this one requires little labour for so subtle and unusual a flavour.</p> <p>500g very fresh chicken livers</p> <p>1 medium onion, peeled and chopped</p> <p>250g unsalted butter</p> <p>6 anchovy fillets</p> <p>1 tsp fine capers</p> <p>3 cloves garlic</p> <p>4 tbsp brandy</p> <p>Pinch dried thyme</p> <p>Sea salt and black pepper</p> <p>Scrupulously clean the livers of any green bits or white, fatty attachments. Gently fry the onion and anchovy fillets in the butter until soft but uncoloured. Raise the heat, stir in the livers and fry until they colour lightly but remain firm to the touch. Add the brandy, thyme, garlic, salt, pepper and capers, and fry for several minutes more.</p> <p>Place the contents of the pan in a liquidiser and blend until very smooth - you may have to do this in batches. Pour into a pretty bowl, cover and refrigerate. Serve with slices of hot toast and a bowl of gherkins.</p> <p><b>A salad of leaves</b></p> <p>A salad is just a salad, isn't it? The modern unnatural obsession for side orders (of which, spuds aside, I rarely approve) has helped put salad in the shade. Salad leaves are as seasonal as vegetables - Jane Grigson's seminal work on the subject has John Evelyn's Salad Calendar, a quick glance at which will give you all you need to know before nipping to the shops. The leaves you choose will depend solely on what is available - the heart of a cos lettuce will be more delicious by far than some shallow character imported in the dead of winter. <br></p> <p>1 big bowl mixed salad leaves</p> <p>6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</p> <p>2 tbsp walnut oil</p> <p>2 tbsp good red-wine vinegar</p> <p>1 tsp Dijon mustard</p> <p>Sea salt and black pepper</p> <p>Put the red-wine vinegar in a bowl, add the salt and pepper and whisk until the salt is dissolved. Add the mustard and walnut oil, whisking all the while. Add the olive oil, whisk until the vinaigrette has emulsified, then dress the salad leaves.</p> <p><b>Apple Tarts</b></p> <p>An enduring classic of that marvellous chef, Michel Gu\u00e9rard. It is also the simplest of desserts, and easy to put together and cook as and when required. I am not sure - as a matter of fact, I really do not want to know - how many of these tarts I made when working as the pastry chef at Bibendum. That feeling of waiting for the last dessert order at half-past midnight, when everyone else in the kitchen had long since gone home and the waiting staff have neglected to tell you that the last two tables only wanted coffee, is a memory that I still carry. Conscience and time will decide whether to make or buy the pastry, as will the decision whether to serve a great bowl of cream alongside - though I would urge you to do so. The amounts given will make one large tart or six small ones.</p> <p>600g puff pastry</p> <p>1.5kg apples, peeled and cored (8-12 fruit, depending on their size)</p> <p>1 lemon, juiced</p> <p>100g melted butter</p> <p>120g caster sugar</p> <p>Lots of cream (optional, but highly recommended)</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 225C/425F/gas mark 7. Roll out the pastry evenly, and leave intact if you're making one large tart, or cut into six even-sized pieces. Place the pastry on a baking sheet and refrigerate.</p> <p>Cut the apples in half through the core and then into thin slices. Lay the slices, overlapping generously, around the pastry, and brush with lemon juice and then melted butter. Strew with caster sugar.</p> <p>The tarts may now be baked straight away, but I prefer to chill them for half an hour or so before cooking. They are always better when prepared well before the meal and put in the oven only half an hour before required at table. Just before cooking, dust with a little more sugar. If the tarts take on too much colour, reduce the temperature slightly. Cook for a further 15-20 minutes until coloured a beautiful mahogany. Serve at once.</p> <p>Jeremy Lee is chef at Blue Print Cafe, Butlers Wharf, London SE1</p>",

Gently fry the onion and anchovy fillets in the butter until soft but uncoloured. Raise the heat, stir in the livers and fry until they colour lightly but remain firm to the touch. Add the brandy, thyme, garlic, salt, pepper and capers, and fry for several minutes more. Place the contents of the pan in a liquidiser and blend until very smooth - you may have to do this in batches. Pour into a pretty bowl, cover and refrigerate. Serve with slices of hot toast and a bowl of gherkins. A salad of leaves A salad is just a salad, isn't it? The modern unnatural obsession for side orders (of which, spuds aside, I rarely approve) has helped put salad in the shade. Salad leaves are as seasonal as vegetables - Jane Grigson's seminal work on the subject has John Evelyn's Salad Calendar, a quick glance at which will give you all you need to know before nipping to the shops. The leaves you choose will depend solely on what is available - the heart of a cos lettuce will be more delicious by far than some shallow character imported in the dead of winter. 1 big bowl mixed salad leaves 6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 2 tbsp walnut oil 2 tbsp good red-wine vinegar 1 tsp Dijon mustard Sea salt and black pepper Put the red-wine vinegar in a bowl, add the salt and pepper and whisk until the salt is dissolved. Add the mustard and walnut oil, whisking all the while. Add the olive oil, whisk until the vinaigrette has emulsified, then dress the salad leaves. Apple Tarts An enduring classic of that marvellous chef, Michel Gu\u00e9rard. It is also the simplest of desserts, and easy to put together and cook as and when required. I am not sure - as a matter of fact, I really do not want to know - how many of these tarts I made when working as the pastry chef at Bibendum. That feeling of waiting for the last dessert order at half-past midnight, when everyone else in the kitchen had long since gone home and the waiting staff have neglected to tell you that the last two tables only wanted coffee, is a memory that I still carry. Conscience and time will decide whether to make or buy the pastry, as will the decision whether to serve a great bowl of cream alongside - though I would urge you to do so. The amounts given will make one large tart or six small ones. 600g puff pastry 1.5kg apples, peeled and cored (8-12 fruit, depending on their size) 1 lemon, juiced 100g melted butter 120g caster sugar Lots of cream (optional, but highly recommended) Preheat the oven to 225C/425F/gas mark 7. Roll out the pastry evenly, and leave intact if you're making one large tart, or cut into six even-sized pieces. Place the pastry on a baking sheet and refrigerate. Cut the apples in half through the core and then into thin slices. Lay the slices, overlapping generously, around the pastry, and brush with lemon juice and then melted butter. Strew with caster sugar. The tarts may now be baked straight away, but I prefer to chill them for half an hour or so before cooking. They are always better when prepared well before the meal and put in the oven only half an hour before required at table. Just before cooking, dust with a little more sugar. If the tarts take on too much colour, reduce the temperature slightly. Cook for a further 15-20 minutes until coloured a beautiful mahogany. Serve at once.

Just to remind you, The Hustler, released in 1961, was directed by Robert Rossen, and starred Paul Newman as the hustler of the title, Fast Eddie Felson. </p> <p>A hustler in pool parlance is a gambling player prepared to lose a few games to increase the odds before he and his backers make their killing. We explained that while Fast Eddie Parker claimed to be the model for Fast Eddie Felson, he was not a hustler but a straight player who played his best in all circumstances. </p> <p>We left no doubt, however, that he regarded himself as the main, or even the only, real contributor to the character of Fast Eddie Felson. A heading on his obituary read: \"Professional pool player who was the inspiration for Paul Newman's role in The Hustler.\" </p> <p>We said he had met Walter Tevis, the writer of the novel, The Hustler (1959), when the latter \"was working his way through college\" and that \"Tevis borrowed one of Parker's aliases to create Fast Eddie Felson\" - he claimed on other occasions that he had inspired Tevis to create first the character and hence the novel that was then adapted for the film. </p> <p>Finally, we said that Parker had produced instructional books and videos that Paul Newman had used when preparing to revive the character of Fast Eddie Felson in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, 1986 (the screenplay written by Richard Price after the novel, The Color of Money, 1984, by Walter Tevis). </p> <p>A few days after this obituary appeared I had a call from Eleanora Tevis, the widow of Walter Tevis (he died of lung cancer in August 1984), the first of a number of exchanges by phone and fax, essentially making the same point: \"Since The Hustler's publication in 1959 and the film's release in 1961, many pool players have claimed to be Fast Eddie Felson. Walter consistently stated that The Hustler was a work of fiction and the characters therein were fictitious.\" </p> <p>The exasperation Tevis felt is very well expressed in an article by Roy McHugh that appeared in a newspaper in Pittsburgh in 1983. McHugh said that people kept asking Tevis, in relation to another character in The Hustler, \"When did you first meet Minnesota Fats?\" McHugh said Tevis cringed and wondered whether they would have asked Walt Disney, \"When did you meet Donald Duck?\" (The person referred to here was Rudolf Walter Wanderone Jr. He had been playing under the name of New York Fats, in tribute to his birthplace, but changed his name to Minnesota Fats after Jackie Gleason created the part in The Hustler - see Britannica.com.) </p> <p>This article was headed: \"All 'Fast Eddies' say they're Hustler.\" The piece was prompted by the death of a pool player called Edward \"Fast Eddie\" Pelkey, and the agency wire at the time began: \"Edward 'Fast Eddie' Pelkey, the famed pool shark portrayed by Paul Newman in the movie The Hustler, has died . . .\" Tevis told Roy McHugh: \"I'm weary of explaining this. Nobody believes you when you keep telling them you invent your own characters.\" </p> <p>In 1987, after Eddie Parker had returned to live in his home territory of the Missouri Ozarks, he was interviewed by Bill Maurer from the local newspaper, the News-Leader. His report contains this sentence: \"Parker said he's been reluctant to acknowledge his role [the role he claimed as the model for Tevis's Fast Eddie] until recent years.\" </p> <p> Even more to the point, Maurer contacted four important people: the editor of a leading billiards magazine, the vice-president of the Professional Billiards Association, a professional pool player who had been active in the area where Parker said he met Tevis, and finally Tevis's boyhood friend who taught him to shoot pool. Maurer wrote: \"All four said they've never heard of Parker and questioned his role, if any, in influencing Tevis.\" </p> <p>To return to the instructional manuals and videos by Parker that Paul Newman is supposed to have used when preparing for The Color of Money. Mrs Tevis corresponded with Newman. She says he told her: \"Regardless of anything you've seen in the press, I didn't use any instructional books or tapes. Willie Mosconi taught me everything I knew and was my instructor during the entire film, as well as the technical director.\" Willie Mosconi (see Britannica.com again), an American pocket billiards player, was world champion 15 times between 1941 and 1957.

      "body": "<p>Sex is back on the London stage with the return of two famous female archetypes. On Monday Anna Friel struts her stuff as Frank Wedekind's Lulu in an Almeida production housed in a London bus station. The next night Alexandra von der Weth, a former Lulu in Alban Berg's opera, sings Manon Lescaut at the Royal Opera House - not in the familiar Puccini or Massenet versions but in Hans Werner Henze's 1951 opera set in post-war Paris. So, on successive nights, Lulu and Manon: classic examples of the femme fatale. </p> <p>But what exactly is a femme fatale? Today the term has been appropriated, and debased, by movies, pulp fiction and pop journalism. In film terms it implies a sexual predator who drives men to distraction. In the 1940s and 1950s it was Jane Russell in The Outlaw posing with out-thrust bust, or Marilyn Monroe wiggling her knickerless rump in Niagara. </p> <p>The true femme fatale, however, is more subtle than a straightforward man-eater. For a start, as Henze's opera and Wedekind's play suggest, she is defined by her lack of definition: she is a white screen on to whom we all, men especially, project our fantasies. She is also a victim of society who suffers not just for her own but for everyone else's sins. And she is amoral rather than immoral. </p> <p>To prove the point you have only to go back to the start of the Manon myth. In 1730 the Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost, who combined the careers of monk and soldier, wrote a book whose full title is Histoire du Chevalier des Grieux et de Manon Lescaut. It is this provocative volume that has spawned six operas, one operetta, four ballets, 11 musicals and the Henri-Georges Clouzot film that first caught the young Henze's attention. Beyond that Pr\u00e9vost's Manon provides the prototype for a whole raft of 19th-century heroines, including Carmen, Marguerite Gautier<strong> </strong> and Lulu. By coincidence, one of Pr\u00e9vost's lovers was a widow who also went by the name of Loulou. </p> <p>Read Pr\u00e9vost, however, and what do you find? The first shock is the age of the protagonists. When they first meet, des Grieux is a 17-year-old putative priest and Manon a 15-year-old girl destined for a convent. As a result there is something innocently youthful about their passion: des Grieux recalls, \"We dispensed with the rights of the church and found ourselves man and wife without having given it a thought.\" Des Grieux's problem is that his passion is absolute: Manon's is that she loves him but loves money even more. Three times they set up house together; and three times she deserts him for a richer benefactor. </p> <p>Pr\u00e9vost establishes the template of the true femme fatale. We, as readers, create our own idealised Manon and, in postmodernist style, become part-authors of the story: as many commentators have pointed out, we have no idea of the colour of Manon's hair or eyes, the shape of her face or figure. But she is also the product of a corrupt society. On first leaving des Grieux, she swears undying affection but asks, \"Do you think one can make love when one has nothing to eat?\" In a Paris where sex is the currency, she goes off to raise money in the only way she knows. </p> <p>But the brilliant insight at the heart of Pr\u00e9vost's novel - and what links it to the world of Wedekind, Berg and Henze - is that fidelity is a relative virtue and that character is created by circumstance. Reading the third of Manon's farewell love notes, des Grieux concludes: \"She was sincere but she was fickle, or rather she ceased to be anything - she did not even recognise herself - when she saw other women living in wealth and herself in poverty and want.\" You can project it forward to Wedekind's Lulu, who is not some active monster of depravity but a passive creature defined by her environment. </p> <p>Pr\u00e9vost creates the archetypal femme fatale: a tragic innocent who is not so much the destroyer as the destroyed (it is Manon who finally dies in Louisiana, not des Grieux). But once Manon is translated into an operatic heroine she changes. For practical reasons she can no longer be a teenager. Pr\u00e9vost's plot is also condensed so that it loses its element of rhyming compulsion: the sense that the characters are victims of larger forces. And,fascinating as both Massenet's and Puccini's late 19th century variations on the Manon myth are, they invite moral judgment. Shaw praised Massenet's music but claimed that \"no art can quite redeem the later scenes from the repulsiveness of their moral infamy\". Even today, in English Touring Opera's new production, Manon's social downfall is symbolised by ever more incarnadine costumes. </p> <p> Each age, however, creates its own Manon; and each artist finds personal resonances in the story. With Henze's Boulevard Solitude, set in the Paris of Jean-Paul Sartre and Jean Cocteau and with musical echoes of the Second Viennese School, we seem to have moved a long way from Pr\u00e9vost. This is a work that clearly deals with the condition of post-war Europe: the loneliness of the city, the difficulties attendant on freedom, the existential aimlessness of the individual. It is no accident that Nikolaus Lehnhoff's Royal Opera House production is set within the framework of a railway station, which becomes a symbol of urban frenzy and anonymity. </p> <p>And yet, from reading Grete Weil's libretto, it seems that Henze's opera is in some ways closer to Pr\u00e9vost than it is to Puccini or Massenet. In the novel the hero, a lightly disguised version of Pr\u00e9vost, tells his story to the so-called Man of Quality; in Henze's autobiographical opera the focus is similarly on Armand and his sense of alienation. And, in place of the 19th-century vision of Manon as a tart with a heart, she becomes a more mysterious figure first seen heading off to finishing school in Lausanne and finally imprisoned for murder. She doesn't change or develop. She leaves us, as it were, to complete the picture. </p> <p>That is the true essence of the femme fatale. The Oxford Dictionary's definition is simply \"a dangerously attractive woman\". And in popular culture the term is promiscuously applied to anyone from Mandy Rice-Davies to Monica Lewinsky. But the fascination of the truly fatal woman stems from an innocent amorality. She is obviously a male construct and, at a subconscious level, probably represents a deep-seated fear. </p> <p>But the simple truth is that, when you read the Pr\u00e9vost novel, you can't help falling headlong for Manon. Like all great femmes fatales, she has a shadowy allure that lies beyond reason; and it is that very calculated indefiniteness that makes her as potent a symbol for a radical composer such as Henze as she was for a libertine cleric such as Pr\u00e9vost. </p> <p>\u0095 Henze's Boulevard Solitude is at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (020-7304 4000), from Tuesday until April 4. Wedekind's Lulu is at the Almeida at King's Cross, London N1 (020-7359 4404), from Monday until May 12. English Touring Opera's production of Massenet's Manon is at Poole Arts Centre (01202 685222) on Tuesday and then tours to Jersey, Leicester, Truro, Exeter and Lincoln.</p>",

And, in place of the 19th-century vision of Manon as a tart with a heart, she becomes a more mysterious figure first seen heading off to finishing school in Lausanne and finally imprisoned for murder. She doesn't change or develop. She leaves us, as it were, to complete the picture. That is the true essence of the femme fatale. The Oxford Dictionary's definition is simply \"a dangerously attractive woman\". And in popular culture the term is promiscuously applied to anyone from Mandy Rice-Davies to Monica Lewinsky. But the fascination of the truly fatal woman stems from an innocent amorality. She is obviously a male construct and, at a subconscious level, probably represents a deep-seated fear. But the simple truth is that, when you read the Pr\u00e9vost novel, you can't help falling headlong for Manon. Like all great femmes fatales, she has a shadowy allure that lies beyond reason; and it is that very calculated indefiniteness that makes her as potent a symbol for a radical composer such as Henze as she was for a libertine cleric such as Pr\u00e9vost. \u0095 Henze's Boulevard Solitude is at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (020-7304 4000), from Tuesday until April 4. Wedekind's Lulu is at the Almeida at King's Cross, London N1 (020-7359 4404), from Monday until May 12. English Touring Opera's production of Massenet's Manon is at Poole Arts Centre (01202 685222) on Tuesday and then tours to Jersey, Leicester, Truro, Exeter and Lincoln.",

      "body": "<p>The Whitechapel Art Gallery in east London is celebrating its centenary with an exhibition, parties and a publication. Why all the fanfare? This is where our love affair with modern art began. The gallery's first 50 years were notable enough, withexhibitions that reflected the political passions of the pre-war East End, such as Picasso's Guernica in 1939, but it is the last 50 years that have been most extraordinary. Before Tate Modern was a glint in Nicholas Serota's eye, the Whitechapel put on shows that made other British galleries look tame. </p> <p>Serota was the Whitechapel's director between 1976 and 1988; this was where he made his name. He built on the work of Bryan Robertson (1952-68), who set out to make what was thought of as a local gallery into a national stage for modern art. Almost all the most influential modern art exhibitions in post-war Britain happened here: Jackson Pollock's first British show in 1958, Mark Rothko's in 1961, Robert Rauschenberg's retrospective in 1964. Most famous was 1956's This Is Tomorrow, which explored architecture, technology, sci-fi and consumerism. Richard Hamilton's poster for the show, featuring a TV-age interior in which a bodybuilder wields a phallic lolly that says POP, is the mythic founding moment of pop art. </p> <p>In Serota's era came exhibitions whose influence can still be felt: Gilbert and George, the post-minimalist American sculptor Eva Hesse and Bruce Nauman, not to mention key shows of 1980s painters such as Julian Schnabel, Georg Baselitz and Anselm Kiefer. The current director, Catherine Lampert, who leaves at the end of the centenary show, has continued the mix of big names and experimental shows, from the Gary Hume retrospective in 1999 to last year's acclaimed Live in Your Head. Her replacement, Iwona Blazwick, one of the team who launched Tate Modern, looks back at the shows Serota put on as her introduction to art. This is how she and her predecessors view the Whitechapel_ </p> <p><strong> Mark Glazebrook</strong> </p> <p> Director, 1969-71 </p> <p>I was only there for three years but they were so turbulent they have stayed etched in my memory. Before I got there the gallery had one of its frequent periods of financial crisis. I thought it would be easier to raise the money than it was. I had seen the Jackson Pollock exhibition and I had always admired my predecessor, Bryan Robertson, and the Whitechapel, but the reality was very different. </p> <p>One always had to be very entrepreneurial. I was preparing this David Hockney show, which was a terrific success. Hockney did a special print in aid of the Whitechapel and we sold it at the door. Some people objected to the gallery taking money from an artist, but I found this had always happened through [its] history. </p> <p>Tower Hamlets and Hackney had cut off the grants, because Bryan had made the Whitechapel such an international sensation they no longer felt it was a local gallery. In fact it has always been both - only when funds are really low does it sink back to folk art from Stepney Green or whatever. </p> <p>I was very proud of my Hockney show, the Modern Chairs design show, the Donald Judd show. Gilbert and George [who live nearby] asked me, \"Can we do an exhibition?\" I said, \"Yes - what's it going to be?\" They said, \"Ourselves asking ourselves questions in the gallery.\" I said, \"Do you want to get me the sack?\" </p> <p>I [liked] Bryan very much and have the greatest appreciation for his achievement - he had done Turner, he had done Malevich, as well as the contemporary British and American shows. The great thing is that, with blips, the show has gone on. </p> <p><strong> Nicholas Serota</strong> </p> <p> Director, 1976-88 </p> <p>There were moments in the late 1970s when it was thought that the Whitechapel no longer had a place - for example when the Hayward opened - but we showed that it does. I first went there in 1964 when I was 18; I saw the Rauschenberg show. I went there the next year to see Franz Kline. I remember being knocked out by the darkness of these paintings. </p> <p>Following Bryan Robertson's departure, there was a decade that was difficult for the Whitechapel, though Mark Glazebrook [who ran the gallery before a series of caretaker administrations] did a couple of very good things. I think what I was trying to do when I got there was to restore its national and international reputation and its link to the local community. </p> <p>I had only been at the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, for three years and I hesitated. But I went because the Whitechapel had a lot of problems and I thought, \"If I don't go now, maybe it won't be there.\" I saw it as an opportunity to do something different: the Eva Hesse show, the Kiefer show, the Kounellis exhibition. Also one or two important historical shows [such as] the Beckmann triptychs. The following show, 20th Century British Sculpture, was absurdly overambitious but a success. The Carl Andre show was also very beautiful. The Gilbert and George show certainly made people in Britain sit up. </p> <p>The gallery feels as though it's close to artists; when I did an auction to raise money in 1987, their donations raised a lot of money. I think the challenge for the future is going to be to maintain a sense of edge in a world where there is a much greater acceptance of modern art. The gallery will have to find new ways to surprise us - which is clearly why they have appointed Iwona. </p> <p>I was asked to be on the selection panel for the new director. I refused because the Tate was looking for someone for Liverpool; but I said, \"What makes you so sure I don't want to apply for the job myself?\" </p> <p><strong> Catherine Lampert</strong> </p> <p> Director, 1988-May 2001 </p> <p>When I arrived, London had a lot of new independent spaces that offered competition for some of the landmark exhibitions that Bryan Robertson and Nicholas Serota did. I looked for things that had not been covered - for example, one-woman shows. </p> <p>The Whitechapel has always had to find territory. It does not have financial power; it has to find a role. Its atmosphere is special; its exhibitions are sometimes chaotic but they are not organised to impress the rich. It has had the good fortune that the local Jewish population in its early years were culturally ambitious and then in the 1930s there was a lot of political involvement. More recently, exhibitions [such as] 000zerozerozero have brought forward Asian artists. I do not think it is about local art; I think it is about the right atmosphere and not being on the circuit. </p> <p>Juan Gris was one of my favourite shows here, and some of the shows that have featured Latin American artists - Tunga and Francis Al\u00ffs. The Leigh Bowery pictures were, I think, the peak of Lucian Freud's later years. </p> <p>The competition for historical shows is so intense that it is harder to pick up the mentors of young artists. We are trying to do a Kippenberger show but may be outbid financially. We should pick up unusual, research-type exhibitions; we should buy the library next door as a project space. I think having a more underground place would give people access. </p> <p><strong> Iwona Blazwick</strong> </p> <p> Director designate </p> <p>When I started getting interested in art it was partly as a result of seeing exhibitions at the Whitechapel. The Eva Hesse exhibition just knocked me out. The space itself is so beautiful, a purpose-built Kunsthalle-type space, top-lit. The way it was remodelled [by Nicholas Serota] was very successful. The area too is interesting, with a variety of communities. </p> <p>The aim of the Whitechapel was to make London more connected with the international scene. It has had an interesting connection with the global avant garde - it was amazing that it was so open, particularly to non-western art. It gives younger artists who have come up in group shows a chance to stand alone and be seen in real depth - the Gary Hume show was a recent example, and the Jeff Wall show and the Rosemarie Trockel. </p> <p>I want to build on the precedents that have been set. At Tate Modern, my knowledge and interest have broadened and I want to use that here, putting on bigger solo shows while being committed to the contemporary. Also I am very interested in maintaining the international context. Theme shows, too - Inside the Visible was an excellent example. Spaces [such as] the Whitechapel should be there to ask questions through an exhibition, as it did recently with Live in Your Head. </p> <p>\u0095 The centenary exhibition is at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London E1, from March 21 to May 20.

      "body": "<p>This has been quite a week for musicologists, with the first performance of the newly authenticated Handel Gloria at the Royal Academy of Music on Thursday, coinciding with news of a second find, at Calderdale record office in Halifax, West Yorkshire - a manuscript of a hitherto unknown arrangement of Handel's oratorio Judas Maccabaeus (1747), attributed on the title page to WA Mozart. Such rare events inevitably lead to more questions, painstaking research, and sometimes few conclusions. </p> <p>This is certainly true of the Halifax score, which I called up from the vaults of the record office at the end of last summer. While researching musical life in Halifax, I had come across William Priestley (1779-1861), a local wool clothier, whose personal library housed many unusual items of German choral music, which had formed much of the early repertory of the Halifax Choral Society - still performing today and thought to be the oldest choral society in Britain. </p> <p>Trying to reconstruct Priestley's library had led me to York minster library and Halifax parish church. I was going through the musical scores kept at the record office to see if any of Priestley's volumes had found their way there. Among these scores was a manuscript full score of Handel's oratorio, but on opening the first volume, and seeing the phrase \"with additional wind and brass parts by WA Mozart\" on the title page, I realised this was a very unusual score indeed. I knew Mozart had arranged four of Handel's choral works between 1788 and 1790, for a circle of Handel enthusiasts in Vienna headed by Baron Gottfried van Swieten; but here, apparently, was a fifth, something on which the standard reference works I consulted could shed no light. </p> <p>Rumours that Mozart had arranged Handel's Judas Maccabaeus were clearly circulating in Europe shortly after his death, to judge by reports in early 19th-century German periodicals; but these were scotched by early Mozart scholar Leopold von Sonnleithner, who concluded that they must refer to an anonymous arrangement, probably by the composer Josef Starzer, which had been performed by the Vienna Tonk\u00fcnstlersoziet\u00e4t in 1779. This arrangement appears to have survived in the Osterreichischen Nationalbibliothek in Vienna, where it can be viewed today. However, the Halifax arrangement differs from this in several ways and while the Starzer arrangement features about two-thirds of Handel's original work, the Halifax arrangement includes much more. </p> <p>Mozart did not list this work among the Handel arrangements in the notebook he used to keep track of his compositions. And the handwriting in the Halifax score is that of an unidentified copyist, whose style suggests he was probably north German rather than Viennese. But a study of the paper type, ink, handwriting and provenance of the manuscript sug gests it may date from the late 18th or early 19th century, and the confident attribution on the title page certainly merits careful investigation. </p> <p>The Halifax score is a beautiful piece of work - a fair copy, with scarcely any erasures or crossings out. There are additional markings made at a later date, giving dynamics, cues and pencilled translations of the German words back into the original English, probably added in the 1850s, when the Halifax Choral Society is known to have performed the arrangement at least six times. The score was presented to the society by William Priestley in May 1850, and Priestley said it had come via one of the Moravian settlements in Germany. </p> <p> The Moravians, protestant missionaries with their headquarters in Saxony, had a strong presence in Halifax, and Priestley had musical links with the nearby Moravian settlement of Fulneck, near Pudsey, Leeds. One distinguished and well-travelled Moravian clergyman, Christian Ignatius Latrobe, is known to have regularly carried newly published music from the continent to England during the early 19th century. He had introduced English musicians to many of Mozart's and Haydn's masses in this way. In 1817, Latrobe bought a considerable number of \"manuscript music scores and some very good German oratorios\" from Breitkopf &amp; H\u00e4rtel in Leipzig, near Niesky, who had abandoned their attempts to publish a complete edition of Mozart's works around 1808 through lack of demand. If this Judas Maccabaeus arrangement was among those scores, it seems possible that Latrobe passed it to Priestley. How the score got to Breitkopf &amp; Hartel is hard to say. One of the early 19th-century Brietkopf &amp; Hartel catalogues did indeed list a Mozart arrangement of Maccabaeus, but since no exemplar of this edition has survived, it is assumed that it never materialised. </p> <p>It is possible that the Halifax score was the source of an edition for voices and piano of Judas Maccabaeus apparently also \"as arranged by Mozart\", which was published by JA B\u00f6hme in Hamburg in 1820, a copy of which is in the British Library. (The Halifax score differs from this one in that the orchestral parts are detailed fully, allowing us to see clearly the changes made by the arranger.) Again, Latrobe was also a customer of B\u00f6hme. </p> <p>So much, then, for the history of the manuscript, but what of the arrangement itself? Stylistically, there are many features that support the attribution of the arrangement to Mozart. In his Handel arrangements, Mozart filled out Handel's orchestral textures, which to late 18th-century Viennese audiences must have seemed sparse and primitive. In particular, the addition of clarinets and trombones made the most of these relative newcomers to the orchestra. See the Conqu'ring Hero Come, which is more familiar to us as the hymn Thine Be the Glory, was already colourfully orchestrated by Handel, so not much has been changed. There are particularly beautiful moments, however, in the slow, solo numbers, such as the soprano's Ah! Wretched Israel, where the clarinet and flute are given new counter-melodies to the vocal line over Handel's string textures. </p> <p> It will always be difficult to say for sure whether these touches are truly Mozart's, or to what extent he had a hand in this arrangement, but this is an accomplished piece of work. If it is by Mozart, this suggests that Mozart's studies and modernisations of Handel's oratorios were more extensive than previously thought, and it adds another episode to what we know of his musical activities in the later 1780s - a time when his popularity in Vienna was at its height, three or four years before his death. Further, the score adds detail to our understanding of Mozart's response to an early 18th-century master such as Handel, and while modern audiences may find the notion of Mozart modernising Handel distasteful, in view of our pursuit of \"authentic\" performances, this is a fascinating document which merits continuing research. </p> <p>More detailed discussion of this manuscript will appear in a future edition of the Musical Times, and we are currently looking into the possibility of a performance by Halifax Choral Society. Given this manuscript's history entwined with that of the Choral Society, Priestley, we hope, would have approved.</p>",

Investors have had to grapple with Asia's tiger economies and brave Brazilian downpours, only to see a negative return.</p> <p>But with the UK market falling and technology shares in the doldrums, investors may look to more exotic shores again. A new poll this week shows that serious investors are considering the move towards less well known markets.</p> <p>Some 78% of people polled by Brunswick Direct, an emerging markets online broker, said emerging markets will outperform \"emerged\" markets in 2001. Two out of five think emerging markets will rise 10% to 20% in US dollar terms this year, while 28% expected returns in excess of 20% in the year. China is expected to be the best performer in 2001, Turkey the worst.</p> <p>Brunswick's Willem De Geer says: \"The results confirm that investors are be coming positive about emerging markets after a difficult year. I think it is very significant that China topped the poll as the market with the most upside in 2001. Its upcoming entry into the World Trade Organisation will be a milestone in the history of emerging markets.\"</p> <p>Investing in emerging markets is like buying houses in grotty areas around the world and hoping they will become the next Chelsea or Islington. But Mark Dampier, head of research at the independent financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \"Emerging markets have had awful returns over the past five years.

      "bodyText": "Emerging markets are not for the faint-hearted. Investors have had to grapple with Asia's tiger economies and brave Brazilian downpours, only to see a negative return. But with the UK market falling and technology shares in the doldrums, investors may look to more exotic shores again. A new poll this week shows that serious investors are considering the move towards less well known markets. Some 78% of people polled by Brunswick Direct, an emerging markets online broker, said emerging markets will outperform \"emerged\" markets in 2001. Two out of five think emerging markets will rise 10% to 20% in US dollar terms this year, while 28% expected returns in excess of 20% in the year. China is expected to be the best performer in 2001, Turkey the worst. Brunswick's Willem De Geer says: \"The results confirm that investors are be coming positive about emerging markets after a difficult year. I think it is very significant that China topped the poll as the market with the most upside in 2001. Its upcoming entry into the World Trade Organisation will be a milestone in the history of emerging markets.\" Investing in emerging markets is like buying houses in grotty areas around the world and hoping they will become the next Chelsea or Islington. But Mark Dampier, head of research at the independent financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \"Emerging markets have had awful returns over the past five years. Like technology, it was the final frontier experiencing very high growth.\" Investment trusts aimed at emerging markets are now at a 20-year record discount, after trading at a premium. They have suffered as big international investors stuck with the familiar rather than going to less well-known regions. In the investment trust sector, funds are nursing losses of up to 30%.

      "body": "<p>He is one of the most original and accomplished painters of the 20th century, and yet he is also synonymous with a peculiarly English eccentricity. He is the artist who treated Cookham, the little Thameside village where he lived, as the measure of all experience. He is the prophet of divine sexuality who, at the second post, fell humiliated victim to a fortune-seeking lesbian. When Timothy Hyman and I set out to curate Tate Britain's new exhibition of Stanley Spencer's work, we realised that we would have to fight our way through the bizarre collection of fragmentary anecdotes that now shape his memory. </p> <p>Many concern Spencer's chaotic sex life, but the one that I found most enigmatic was different. It is recorded, in various memoirs, that in the autumn of 1954, this most English of painters left his home in Berkshire to visit Beijing, where he would inform Chou En-lai, the communist premier, that \"I feel at home in China because I feel that Cookham is somewhere near, only just around the corner\". </p> <p>The very idea of Spencer in China seems inherently unlikely. Indeed, it has been suggested that he was almost certainly invited by accident, after the authorities got him muddled up with the then radical poet, Stephen Spender. That theory can now be discounted, even though Spender himself apparently described being mistaken, while in China, for both Spender and the Elizabethan poet Spenser. Behind this curious anecdote lies an unexpected story, which can be reconstructed with the help of Spencer's previously unexamined notebooks, photographs and letters, and also the recollections of John Chinnery, who joined the Beijing-bound delegation as translator and \"sinologue\". </p> <p>He now dismisses the Spender story as \"absolute rubbish\" and remarks that, whatever his reputation as an idiosyncratic Englishman, Spencer knew a lot about China and its art: partly through his leftwing friend and brother- in-law, Richard Carline, who was associated with the Britain-China Friendship Association; and partly through his close friendship - since written out of Spencer's known biography thanks to the dominant cult of Cookham - with the London-based Chinese artists, Fei Cheng-wu and Chang Chien-ying. </p> <p>The story of Spencer's visit to China is characterised by the combination of high art, low comedy and personal tragedy that marked much of his life. It took place in September 1954, before Chairman Mao's industrialising \"Great Leap Forward\" of 1958, and when Beijing was still largely a medieval city. Spencer was 63, a celebrated senior artist, with most of his major work behind him. Along with more than 600 other figures in the arts and sciences, he had signed a statement of goodwill towards the Chinese people, instigated by a small group of communist sympathisers loosely associated with the Britain-China Friendship Association. </p> <p>The Chinese authorities offered to pay for five signatories to attend the celebrations of the fifth anniversary of the communist liberation in Beijing. Spencer was selected along with Hugh Casson, the architect and exponent of postwar American mass housing; Rex Warner, a novelist, poet and classicist who had been head of the British Institute in Rome; and the philosopher AJ Ayer, who accepted the invitation as an \"astonishing windfall\" though he was puzzled as to why he had been picked. The delegation was headed by Professor Leonard Hawkes, an elderly geologist, who was also president of the Mineralogical Society and, as Chinnery laughingly suggests, the only safe pair of hands in the party. </p> <p>The delegation flew from Heathrow to Amsterdam and then Prague, where they boarded a plane for the Soviet Union. On the way, Spencer drew the wing of the plane as it looked from his porthole, and scribbled a note in praise of the entrancing - and, thanks to the Iron Curtain, now also forbidden - world that could be glimpsed through a fleeting break in the clouds. At Minsk, they were put up in a collective dormitory. </p> <p>Chinnery remembers Spencer looking around and asking: \"Do you think it is time for me to go to byes?\" Surprised, Chinnery said yes, and Spencer duly put himself to bed. Casson was tolerant of the English painter's quirky observations. In Casson's record of the journey, Red Lacquer Days (Lion and Unicorn Press, 1956), he describes Spencer comparing the party to a group of \"deathwatch beetles\" condemned only to go forward, as if they were munching their way through the roof-beams of an old English church rather than traversing the communist world. AJ Ayer was less patient. This eminent logical positivist and campaigner for secularism confessed to being infuriated by his strange, self-educated companion, whose outlook was, as Chinnery agrees, \"highly illogical\". </p> <p>In his autobiography, More of My Life (Collins, 1984), Ayer would declare himself \"repelled by the \"eroticism and religiosity\" of Spencer's paintings, even though he did not question his technical skill. He conceded that Spencer's \"gnome-like appearance was not unappealing\", and he was prepared to tolerate \"minor eccentricities\" such as his habit of wearing his pyjamas as underclothes (Chinnery confirms that Spencer's pyjama cord was, indeed, often to be seen dangling down in front of his trousers). </p> <p>But Spencer's conversation was too much for the philosopher. When he was not repudiating Spencer's pronouncements on art and religion, Ayer took refuge behind the defensively raised covers of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. As the party proceeded across the Soviet Union, he took up a position close to Rex Warner, who happily launched into scholastic disquisitions on ancient Greece, while also taking a low-key approach to the whole adventure - epitomised by his habit of asking, \"Where's the bar?\" at every new point of arrival. </p> <p>Ayer described Spencer as \"the most self-centred man I have ever met\", mocking his incessant allusions to Cookham and his habit of \"referring to various women by their Christian names and recounting episodes in his biography as if we had taken part in them\". </p> <p>As Chinnery recalls, the women on Spencer's mind were his two lost wives: Hilda Carline, whom Spencer had married in 1925; and Patricia Preece, for whom he had left Hilda disastrously in 1937, giving her his house, showering her with expensive gifts, and then, very shortly after they married, finding himself kicked out so that Preece could resume her now financially improved relationship with her lover, Dorothy Hepworth. </p> <p>Spencer loved Moscow, writing to friends that his long-standing desire to tread on Russian soil, so long imagined through the works of Dostoevsky, Chekhov and Turgenev, was now completely fulfilled, and that \"politics has nothing to do with it\". They saw new skyscrapers going up like rockets, thanks to the women labourers who, as Ayer noticed from his hotel window, \"tossed bricks around from dawn to dusk\". They visited the Kremlin, where Spencer, as he wrote in a letter to Dickory Frank, felt tears in his eyes as he admired the Cathedral of the Annunciation and the Cathedral of the Assumption, both within the Kremlin walls and distinguished by their medieval icons. </p> <p>They twice attended the Bolshoi theatre, where they saw Verdi's Aida (\"simply magnificent\") and Prokofiev's Cinderella (\"very lovely music with great, sweeping themes'\"). One evening, while visiting an agricultural show, they came across some prodigious rams. Chinnery was surprised when Spencer pointed to their huge dangling testicles and remarked that, with equipment like that, he might have done better with Patricia Preece. </p> <p>Airborne again, Spencer sketched a little boy asleep in the arms of his mother, praised the scent of wild thyme in Siberia, and imagined that he and his fellow delegates were a party of \"unborn kings in the body of the plane\", waiting to be \"baptised\" before emerging into the world outside. </p> <p>For Ayer, Spencer only brought further irritation in Beijing. He remembered him sitting at the breakfast table in the Foreign Delights hotel, berating the waiters in pidgin French when they failed to supply him with bacon and eggs. In fact, as Chinnery recalls, that bad- tempered outburst actually occurred when the waiters brought the customary three boiled eggs rather than the single one the painter had requested. Spencer was there with the other delegates when they presented their statement of goodwill to the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries; and he attended the reception with the premier, Chou En-lai. </p> <p>Chou informed the visitors that the Chinese were a home-loving people: \"So am I,\" said Spencer. \"It took China to get me away from Cookham.\" (Gilbert Spencer recounts this moment in his book, Stanley Spencer By His Brother, 1961). But Spencer was not at ease with China's surging blue-clad masses. He managed the banquets and receptions, at which the visitors ate sea slugs, fish lips and Beijing duck. He saw the young Dalai Lama, then being toured round the People's Republic in a \"gesture of friendship\", and witnessed the formal election of Mao Zedong as chairman. Spencer admired the temples, gardens, pavilions and soon-to-be- demolished wall of old Beijing, and also the magical courts of the Forbidden City. He visited the Great Wall of China, sketching Buddhas and distant views in his notebook, alongside gnomic thoughts such as \"wandering people cease their steps\". </p> <p>But stately military parades offered no attraction for the artist of the Sandham Memorial Chapel at Burghclere, who had gone to such lengths to find a vision of peace and resurrection in his memory of the first world war. Casson records Spencer ducking out of the National Day parade on October 1, pleading his dislike of the crowds as he left the others, including Ayer, to stand there for hours watching \"the military ironwork clattering by\". </p> <p>While Ayer lectured Chinese philosophers on logical positivism and Rex Warner entered and won a drinking competition with the famously bibulous translator Yang Xianyi, Spencer drew in the studio allocated to him at the art school and met Chinese artists, including the great nonagenarian painter, calligrapher and seal carver, Qi Baishi (Chi Pai-shih). He left some money with an official of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, asking him to buy some of Qi's works and mail them on to him in Cookham. </p> <p>Yet, in a deeper sense than was intended by Ayer, Spencer was indeed a peculiarly \"self-centred\" visitor to China. When all the official business was over, he found his own uses for the trip as an autobiographical artist who, in a note written 20 years previously, had recorded his wish to write the story of his life as if it were a wandering existence, both physical and mental, like \"a journey to China\". </p> <p>During the course of the visit, Spencer found it impossible to combine sightseeing with painting. So, in October, after Ayer and the other British visitors had returned to their teaching jobs in Britain, he stayed on with Chinnery for 10 days and, in his own words, \"did a little oil painting\" in the valley of the Ming tombs near Beijing. These famous antiquities are approached via an avenue of stone figures, starting with animals - elephants, horses, dragons and camels - and then proceeding to the officials or ministers. Here he painted two oils: one, showing the stone camels, called Ming Tombs, Peking [Beijing], the other of the officials, called The Ministers, Peking. </p> <p>Spencer surveyed all Russia and China in a strange spirit of recognition: \"As I drove along the roads from the airports to the towns it was almost comic to see these dreams of mine coming true on either side of the road.\" </p> <p>He provided some definition of these \"dreams\" he had seen in the valley of the Ming tombs shortly after returning to Cookham from China. In November 1954, he wrote a letter to Hilda Carline, who had divorced him in 1937 as he took up with Patricia Preece, wishing that she had been with him on the journey. </p> <p>Transposed to the Mongolian steppe, she would have been surrounded by \"hundreds of miles of nowhere\", in a world where \"the only happening is yourself\". Spencer also reminded Hilda of a comparison he had made some years before his trip to China. Writing to her in 1948, he had recalled how they had longed for marriage in the 1920s. They had once glimpsed a great plain through an opening in the road at Wangford - the Suffolk village where Hilda had served as a land girl in the first world war - and imagined this \"vast Gobi desert of you\" as the prospect of their future togetherness, its distant \"shapes and forms\" suggesting \"various parts\" of the life they would share. </p> <p>On returning from China, Spencer wrote to Hilda again. reminding her that the plain at Wangford had been their \"place of the Ming tombs\". They had seen photographs of these great imperial statues, and had felt that \"our together selves was like the remoteness of these animals\". </p> <p>As these letters suggest, Spencer's paintings of the Ming tombs are strangely autobiographical images. They show the enigmatic remnants of a lost age and its promises: cracked and abandoned in an apparently parched and desertified landscape. They are regretful images of the \"shapes and forms\" that might have lived, had Spencer's first marriage lasted, or had his attempted rapprochement with Hilda Carline ever come off. </p> <p>It is characteristic of Spencer that he could journey to the other side of the world and still find himself curiously at home. Sadly, Hilda Carline would never receive her former husband's explanation of his Chinese paintings, nor any of the countless letters that he continued to write her. She had died in 1950. </p> <p>\u00a9 Patrick Wright, 2001. The Stanley Spencer exhibition opens at Tate Britain, Millbank, London SW1 next Thursday.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Wanted: carer for poor old girl in need of love and attention. Would suit someone with time on their hands and an interest in preserving old wrecks. Not the kind of advert that would appeal to everyone, but then, according to campaigners for preserving historic buildings, it takes a certain sort of person to buy and restore a property under threat.</p> <p>Architect Neil Worrell is looking for a kindred spirit to take on a building that captured his heart back in 1995. The Bluecoat Brewery in Hertfordshire, a sand-coloured brick building with a weatherboard top, is the sort of project that the renovation enthusiast would adore. The brewery was built in 1875 by Henry Baker and the beer produced there was sold from a roadside pub. It operated until 1935 when it became a storage depot and thereafter slipped into disrepair.</p> <p>\"The owner was about to demolish it,\" Mr Worrell says. \"When I took it on it was practically derelict. The upper storey had all but collapsed. And five tons worth of roof was about to fall into the neighbour's garden.\" Emergency surgery means the building has now been made safe. Mr Worrell carried out urgent structural repairs and obtained planning permission and listed building consent for its conversion into a three-bedroom house - it is only 30 minutes by train to London's Liverpool Street station.</p> <p>\"The Bluecoat is off the critical list, but there's still an awful lot to do,\" Mr Worrell says. He is now selling the building, which still needs complete renovation, with the plans he has drawn up for the conversion. It's on the market for \u00a3200,000. Other projects mean he no longer has the time to carry out the work himself.</p> <p>He is looking for a buyer with the help of Save, a charity that campaigns to protect Britain's heritage. Save runs a register which matches would-be renovators with historic, crumbling buildings. \"The charity began its life campaigning for the preservation of country houses, which 25 years ago were being demolished at an alarming rate,\" says Adam Wilkinson, Save secretary. More recently, campaigns have focused on preserving the country's industrial heritage, such as northern mills, and Victorian asylums vacated by the NHS, he explains.</p> <p>Mr Wilkinson says the charity sets out to ensure the buildings have a future. This almost always involves a battle, he adds. In recent times the government's enthusiasm for regeneration means hundreds of industrial buildings have now been converted into trendy shops and homes. As a result, the emphasis has shifted to protecting smaller, individual properties at risk rather than fighting for specific types of building, says Mr Wilkinson.</p> <p>Although not an estate agent, through its register Save advertises buildings at risk in the hope of finding someone willing to take them on. Unlike the Bluecoat Brewery, few are for sale and the first hurdle for a renovator to leap is persuading the owner to part with it. Sadly, many owners are not only reluctant to maintain their property, but also refuse to sell it to someone who can.</p> <p>However, the register gives contact details for the local authority and the local conservation officer who will be able to give some information about a building at risk. If the owner is not known they can be traced via the Land Registry for a small fee. It is then up to interested buyers to contact the owner and persuade them to part with their property.</p> <p>The register contains a wide range of buildings, from country houses to tiny cottages and town houses. In Lincolnshire, there's the Thatched Cottage at Lowthorpe Road, Soutrey - a tiny Grade II listed property. The main part of the house, which dates from the 17th century, is made of Lincolnshire mud and stud. Save says the property would make an ideal holiday cottage and it is thought likely that the owners will consider selling.</p> <p>Access to the Save register costs \u00a315 for 12 months. Information about other buildings at risk can also be found via the English Heritage online register, which contains Grade I and II* buildings in England and Grade I, II* and II listed properties at risk in London.</p> <p>Restoring a historic building is not for the faint-hearted. Owners will need planning permission and/or listed building consent for some of the works. Local authority conservation officers will be able to advise whether your plans are likely to be acceptable and will help owners navigate their way around the planning system. Councils can get tough and, if they need to, invoke statutory powers to order an urgent works notice. These are usually served when part of a building becomes dangerous. Councils can also serve a repairs notice to order specific work to ensure that the building is preserved. If this notice is ignored, the ultimate sanction - a compulsory purchase order - can be issued.</p> <p>Most owners will be prompted by the repairs notice to either sell or fix the property, says Save. Needless to say, saving buildings costs large amounts of money and, although grants are on offer for some parts of the work, buyers should research the support available before embarking on a purchase. Sympathetic lenders such as the Ecology Building Society (0845 674 5566) and the Norwich and Peterborough (01733 372 372) offer mortgages for renovation projects. There are grants from English Heritage and its Welsh equivalent for Grade I and Grade II* buildings. Some councils also offer grants, although budgets are limited.</p> <p>Anyone interested in Bluecoat Brewery should contact Save 020 7253 3500.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wanted: carer for poor old girl in need of love and attention. Would suit someone with time on their hands and an interest in preserving old wrecks. Not the kind of advert that would appeal to everyone, but then, according to campaigners for preserving historic buildings, it takes a certain sort of person to buy and restore a property under threat. Architect Neil Worrell is looking for a kindred spirit to take on a building that captured his heart back in 1995. The Bluecoat Brewery in Hertfordshire, a sand-coloured brick building with a weatherboard top, is the sort of project that the renovation enthusiast would adore. The brewery was built in 1875 by Henry Baker and the beer produced there was sold from a roadside pub. It operated until 1935 when it became a storage depot and thereafter slipped into disrepair. \"The owner was about to demolish it,\" Mr Worrell says. \"When I took it on it was practically derelict. The upper storey had all but collapsed. And five tons worth of roof was about to fall into the neighbour's garden.\" Emergency surgery means the building has now been made safe. Mr Worrell carried out urgent structural repairs and obtained planning permission and listed building consent for its conversion into a three-bedroom house - it is only 30 minutes by train to London's Liverpool Street station. \"The Bluecoat is off the critical list, but there's still an awful lot to do,\" Mr Worrell says. He is now selling the building, which still needs complete renovation, with the plans he has drawn up for the conversion. It's on the market for \u00a3200,000. Other projects mean he no longer has the time to carry out the work himself. He is looking for a buyer with the help of Save, a charity that campaigns to protect Britain's heritage. Save runs a register which matches would-be renovators with historic, crumbling buildings. \"The charity began its life campaigning for the preservation of country houses, which 25 years ago were being demolished at an alarming rate,\" says Adam Wilkinson, Save secretary. More recently, campaigns have focused on preserving the country's industrial heritage, such as northern mills, and Victorian asylums vacated by the NHS, he explains. Mr Wilkinson says the charity sets out to ensure the buildings have a future. This almost always involves a battle, he adds. In recent times the government's enthusiasm for regeneration means hundreds of industrial buildings have now been converted into trendy shops and homes. As a result, the emphasis has shifted to protecting smaller, individual properties at risk rather than fighting for specific types of building, says Mr Wilkinson. Although not an estate agent, through its register Save advertises buildings at risk in the hope of finding someone willing to take them on. Unlike the Bluecoat Brewery, few are for sale and the first hurdle for a renovator to leap is persuading the owner to part with it. Sadly, many owners are not only reluctant to maintain their property, but also refuse to sell it to someone who can. However, the register gives contact details for the local authority and the local conservation officer who will be able to give some information about a building at risk. If the owner is not known they can be traced via the Land Registry for a small fee. It is then up to interested buyers to contact the owner and persuade them to part with their property. The register contains a wide range of buildings, from country houses to tiny cottages and town houses. In Lincolnshire, there's the Thatched Cottage at Lowthorpe Road, Soutrey - a tiny Grade II listed property. The main part of the house, which dates from the 17th century, is made of Lincolnshire mud and stud. Save says the property would make an ideal holiday cottage and it is thought likely that the owners will consider selling. Access to the Save register costs \u00a315 for 12 months. Information about other buildings at risk can also be found via the English Heritage online register, which contains Grade I and II* buildings in England and Grade I, II* and II listed properties at risk in London. Restoring a historic building is not for the faint-hearted. Owners will need planning permission and/or listed building consent for some of the works. Local authority conservation officers will be able to advise whether your plans are likely to be acceptable and will help owners navigate their way around the planning system. Councils can get tough and, if they need to, invoke statutory powers to order an urgent works notice. These are usually served when part of a building becomes dangerous. Councils can also serve a repairs notice to order specific work to ensure that the building is preserved. If this notice is ignored, the ultimate sanction - a compulsory purchase order - can be issued. Most owners will be prompted by the repairs notice to either sell or fix the property, says Save. Needless to say, saving buildings costs large amounts of money and, although grants are on offer for some parts of the work, buyers should research the support available before embarking on a purchase. Sympathetic lenders such as the Ecology Building Society (0845 674 5566) and the Norwich and Peterborough (01733 372 372) offer mortgages for renovation projects. There are grants from English Heritage and its Welsh equivalent for Grade I and Grade II* buildings. Some councils also offer grants, although budgets are limited. Anyone interested in Bluecoat Brewery should contact Save 020 7253 3500.",

      "body": "<p>A full-scale battle over Nationwide building society's future could be just a few months away after carpetbagger Andrew Muir officially launched his conversion campaign this week, writes Rupert Jones.</p> <p>Mr Muir aims to force Britain's biggest building society to convert to a bank and pay windfalls he claims could average between \u00a3700 and \u00a31,000 to its 10m members.</p> <p>The Berkshire recruitment firm boss has set up a website, nationwidewindfalls.com, to preach his carpetbagging philosophy and is calling on members who support his cause to print out, complete and return the conversion resolution form included on the site.</p> <p>If his resolution is declared valid, and he can rustle up enough eligible members to back it, a vote will take place early this summer on whether the society should stay member-owned or convert.</p> <p>Mr Muir, 36, says he wants to ensure that the 2 million members who have signed away their right to a windfall to charity will also be included in the possible multi-billion pound giveaway. On his website Mr Muir, who claims to have 1,500 supporters already, states: \"This may be your only chance to claim a windfall that is rightfully yours ... Nationwide is a huge organisation, a bank in all but name, and will convert at some point. It is better to do it now, while the business is doing well, to get maximum value for members.\"</p> <p>The issue was last put to the test in 1998 when Nationwide defeated by the slimmest of margins a conversion campaign mounted by the eccentric butler Michael Hardern. The society has been immune from another challenge until now.</p> <p>There are several hurdles that Mr Muir needs to jump. He needs the backing of 500 members for his conversion resolution, and the backing of 250 for his nomination for election to the board, and he only has a few weeks to achieve this because the deadline is April 5. And it's not just any old members who can back the resolution - they must have either had \u00a3100-plus in a Nationwide savings account or have owed at least \u00a3100 on a mortgage, in both cases continually for at least two years. Also, the resolution must be judged valid. The society is likely to go through the wording of the resolution and will reject it if it doesn't stand up to legal scrutiny.</p> <p>Provided Mr Muir - who stood unsuccessfully for election to the society's board three years ago - can overcome all these obstacles, Nationwide has said members will be able to vote on his resolution at the annual general meeting on July 19.</p> <p>Pro-mutuality campaigners point to Bradford &amp; Bingley, which floated on the stock market in December, as an example of why it is important for claims made about potential windfalls to be taken with a pinch of salt.</p> <p>Two years ago Stephen Major, the man who led the campaign to force B&amp;B to convert, said windfalls to members would average \u00a32,000.

      "bodyText": "A full-scale battle over Nationwide building society's future could be just a few months away after carpetbagger Andrew Muir officially launched his conversion campaign this week, writes Rupert Jones. Mr Muir aims to force Britain's biggest building society to convert to a bank and pay windfalls he claims could average between \u00a3700 and \u00a31,000 to its 10m members. The Berkshire recruitment firm boss has set up a website, nationwidewindfalls.com, to preach his carpetbagging philosophy and is calling on members who support his cause to print out, complete and return the conversion resolution form included on the site. If his resolution is declared valid, and he can rustle up enough eligible members to back it, a vote will take place early this summer on whether the society should stay member-owned or convert. Mr Muir, 36, says he wants to ensure that the 2 million members who have signed away their right to a windfall to charity will also be included in the possible multi-billion pound giveaway. On his website Mr Muir, who claims to have 1,500 supporters already, states: \"This may be your only chance to claim a windfall that is rightfully yours ... Nationwide is a huge organisation, a bank in all but name, and will convert at some point. It is better to do it now, while the business is doing well, to get maximum value for members.\" The issue was last put to the test in 1998 when Nationwide defeated by the slimmest of margins a conversion campaign mounted by the eccentric butler Michael Hardern. The society has been immune from another challenge until now. There are several hurdles that Mr Muir needs to jump. He needs the backing of 500 members for his conversion resolution, and the backing of 250 for his nomination for election to the board, and he only has a few weeks to achieve this because the deadline is April 5. And it's not just any old members who can back the resolution - they must have either had \u00a3100-plus in a Nationwide savings account or have owed at least \u00a3100 on a mortgage, in both cases continually for at least two years. Also, the resolution must be judged valid. The society is likely to go through the wording of the resolution and will reject it if it doesn't stand up to legal scrutiny. Provided Mr Muir - who stood unsuccessfully for election to the society's board three years ago - can overcome all these obstacles, Nationwide has said members will be able to vote on his resolution at the annual general meeting on July 19. Pro-mutuality campaigners point to Bradford &amp; Bingley, which floated on the stock market in December, as an example of why it is important for claims made about potential windfalls to be taken with a pinch of salt. Two years ago Stephen Major, the man who led the campaign to force B&amp;B to convert, said windfalls to members would average \u00a32,000. But when B&amp;B floated last December, the handouts of 250 shares each ended up being worth only \u00a3610 at the end of the first day's trading.",

More than one in 10 senior executives seek medical help because of stress at work and, according to the CBI, stress-related absence accounts for the loss of 187m working days a year in the UK, costing the country \u00a312bn.</p> <p>The causes of these crippling levels of stress are by now well known: increased casualisation resulting in the constant need to prove oneself; corporate expansion pushing workers further away from an end product, squashing the satisfaction of productivity; heightened awareness of profitability meaning employees have to work harder and longer; and ownership structures across national boundaries, giving individuals less control over their environment.</p> <p>The symptoms are also easy to spot: behavioural ones include constant irritability with people, difficulty in making decisions, suppressed anger, loss of sense of humour, feeling unable to cope and wanting to cry at the slightest problem, according to Cary Cooper and Jill Earnshaw, in their book Stress and Employer Liability. Physical symptoms are lack of appetite or craving for food when under pressure, indigestion, insomnia, headaches and a tendency to sweat.</p> <p>What is more difficult is what to do about it. Legally, following a court case in the 1980s involving a social services officer who suffered a mental breakdown through stress, it is now clear that the employer has a duty to provide a reasonably safe system of work, and employers have recognised that this implies mental as well as physical safety, and have implemented stress management programmes.</p> <p>However, a report issued late last year by Rob Briner, senior lecturer in organisational psychology at Birkbeck College, London has criticised these programmes.</p> <p>\"Much of what is done in the name of stress has become habitual, knee jerk, uncritical, lacking in innovation and, most importantly, not as helpful as it should be in dealing with the real problems employees and organisations face _ People pathologise ordinary responses to work, like getting depressed or angry. If you go on a course that says these things are killing you, it could make things worse.\"</p> <p>In other words, stress is often caused by the structure of a company and it is this problem that needs to be addressed first, rather than the mindset of the employee. But these systemic problems take time to be resolved, and many people are finding their levels of stress intolerable today.</p> <p>There are some forms of stress management which allow the employee to take the matter into their own hands, and which try to give practical solutions, as well as an opportunity to air negative emotions: the difference between stress coaching and stress counselling.</p> <p>The International Stress Management Association refers individuals to stress coaches, depending on the person's personality. \"Some people may need to play more sport, while others need tangible methods to relax. We vet coaches and refer people to someone who will suit them,\" says a spokesman. These coaching services may still be paid for by the employer.</p> <p>The Independent Counselling and Advisory Service has more than 150 corporate clients on its subscriber list, and it offers both a sympathetic ear and practical help. Therapists will talk to clients for as long as is required, and if counselling is not sufficient, pragmatic solutions are also offered. For instance, if the employee is concerned about a relocation, ICAS will help find accommodation in the new town and look up sports facilities or other social outlets. In other words, the support is practical as well as emotional.</p> <p>Alternative therapists may also offer practical mental and physical exercises to dispel existing stress and avoid it in the future, although their qualifications may not be recognised by the British Psychological Society.</p> <p>Andy Smith, a London-based therapist, offers some simple tips. \"Stress is all about the gap between the demands you perceive are being made on you and your perceived resources to meet those demands. You can manage the demands by saying no to extra work, managing your time better or even downshifting to a less demanding job. Another method is to increase the resources available to you. This can be done by cutting down on caffeine - for many people this is all they need to do. Caffeine mimics adrenaline and raises background stress levels. Cutting it out brings an enormous return for very little effort, as does eating more healthily and learning new skills.</p> <p>\"Finally, you can also change your own perceptions.

      "bodyText": "Stress in the workplace accounts for more days off than the common cold. More than one in 10 senior executives seek medical help because of stress at work and, according to the CBI, stress-related absence accounts for the loss of 187m working days a year in the UK, costing the country \u00a312bn. The causes of these crippling levels of stress are by now well known: increased casualisation resulting in the constant need to prove oneself; corporate expansion pushing workers further away from an end product, squashing the satisfaction of productivity; heightened awareness of profitability meaning employees have to work harder and longer; and ownership structures across national boundaries, giving individuals less control over their environment. The symptoms are also easy to spot: behavioural ones include constant irritability with people, difficulty in making decisions, suppressed anger, loss of sense of humour, feeling unable to cope and wanting to cry at the slightest problem, according to Cary Cooper and Jill Earnshaw, in their book Stress and Employer Liability. Physical symptoms are lack of appetite or craving for food when under pressure, indigestion, insomnia, headaches and a tendency to sweat. What is more difficult is what to do about it. Legally, following a court case in the 1980s involving a social services officer who suffered a mental breakdown through stress, it is now clear that the employer has a duty to provide a reasonably safe system of work, and employers have recognised that this implies mental as well as physical safety, and have implemented stress management programmes. However, a report issued late last year by Rob Briner, senior lecturer in organisational psychology at Birkbeck College, London has criticised these programmes. \"Much of what is done in the name of stress has become habitual, knee jerk, uncritical, lacking in innovation and, most importantly, not as helpful as it should be in dealing with the real problems employees and organisations face _ People pathologise ordinary responses to work, like getting depressed or angry. If you go on a course that says these things are killing you, it could make things worse.\" In other words, stress is often caused by the structure of a company and it is this problem that needs to be addressed first, rather than the mindset of the employee. But these systemic problems take time to be resolved, and many people are finding their levels of stress intolerable today. There are some forms of stress management which allow the employee to take the matter into their own hands, and which try to give practical solutions, as well as an opportunity to air negative emotions: the difference between stress coaching and stress counselling. The International Stress Management Association refers individuals to stress coaches, depending on the person's personality. \"Some people may need to play more sport, while others need tangible methods to relax. We vet coaches and refer people to someone who will suit them,\" says a spokesman. These coaching services may still be paid for by the employer. The Independent Counselling and Advisory Service has more than 150 corporate clients on its subscriber list, and it offers both a sympathetic ear and practical help. Therapists will talk to clients for as long as is required, and if counselling is not sufficient, pragmatic solutions are also offered. For instance, if the employee is concerned about a relocation, ICAS will help find accommodation in the new town and look up sports facilities or other social outlets. In other words, the support is practical as well as emotional. Alternative therapists may also offer practical mental and physical exercises to dispel existing stress and avoid it in the future, although their qualifications may not be recognised by the British Psychological Society. Andy Smith, a London-based therapist, offers some simple tips. \"Stress is all about the gap between the demands you perceive are being made on you and your perceived resources to meet those demands. You can manage the demands by saying no to extra work, managing your time better or even downshifting to a less demanding job. Another method is to increase the resources available to you. This can be done by cutting down on caffeine - for many people this is all they need to do. Caffeine mimics adrenaline and raises background stress levels. Cutting it out brings an enormous return for very little effort, as does eating more healthily and learning new skills. \"Finally, you can also change your own perceptions. You respond not to external reality, but to your internal representation of that reality. If you don't like the world as you perceive it, then change your perceptual filters: if you believe you can't do something, you are far less likely to be able to do it,\" he says. If you experience panic attacks in the office, this can be dealt with by reducing adrenaline, by cutting the coffee or cigarettes and breathing more calmly. You also need to relax: adrenaline is re- absorbed by the body in two minutes, so relaxing deeply every day allows the adrenaline to drain away and the rest of the day to flow more easily, he adds.

      "body": "<p>Over the last year UK equities have been volatile, and compared with 12 months ago both the FTSE All Share and the FTSE 100 have fallen sharply - by up to 10% for many investors. If you invested in an Isa last year, particularly a tracker fund, you may be disappointed with its performance and think twice about committing up to \u00a37,000 more of your savings this year.</p> <p>But what do the financial advising experts think? Spinning a yarn about how I'd got my fingers burnt in a tracker fund last year, I set out to take a straw poll among independent financial advisers chosen at random.</p> <p>The general consensus is that Isas are still a must if you have the cash. Ian Williams, of Marshall Williams in Horsham, was bullish. He said: \"The fact that the stock market is currently volatile is really irrelevant. An Isa is a tax wrapper, and it's important that you obtain and hold onto this wrapper, because if you miss the opportunity in any given tax year, it's lost for good\".</p> <p>Opinions were divided on where I should put my money. Joanne Russell, of Alexander Forbes' Croydon office, understood my disappointment with last year's tracker, suggesting that I put \u00a33,000 into a cash mini-Isa with the Nationwide, currently paying 6.2%.</p> <p>She faxed me a list of low-risk equity options for another \u00a33,000, including Aberdeen Asset Management's fixed-interest Isa, Newton's High Yield Bond and Norwich Union's insurance mini-Isa, into which I could put the last \u00a31,000.</p> <p>Colin Larkin, of Metcalf Moat in Orpington, advised against another tracker fund. He called them \"a high-risk option because of the dominance of high technology shares in the FTSE\".</p> <p>A managed fund, despite higher charges, is a better option; the stock market fall means now is a good time to invest. Isas are ideal for a 10-to 15-year period, he said, and now we are in a global economy a \"themed\" fund would be a good option.</p> <p>Judith Kirk, of Partridge Muir &amp; Warren in Tolworth, Surrey, also stressed the tax advantages of Isas and said I would be wrong to be put off by the short-term volatility of equities. She thought I should opt for a \"more conventional growth fund to balance the volatility of the tracker fund\" I said I'd bought last year.</p> <p>She favoured either Jupiter's, Deutsche's or ABN Ambro's UK Growth funds, or Fidelity's Wealthbuilder.</p> <p>Colin Peck of Berry Birch &amp; Noble in West Wickham, Kent, sensibly suggested that a good way to invest, if I was slightly cautious, was to choose an Isa fund manager that allows you to \"drip feed\" the money in. As long as you hand over the full \u00a37,000 to the fund managers before the end of the tax year, it counted as this year's allowance.</p> <p>They hold the money in a deposit account, earning a modest rate of interest, and pay into your Isa in regular instalments, so not all the money is invested when prices are high.</p> <p>All agreed that no one can predict with certainty how the stock market will perform over the next year, but most said \"City experts\" were predicting a rise of around 7%. We'll see.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Over the last year UK equities have been volatile, and compared with 12 months ago both the FTSE All Share and the FTSE 100 have fallen sharply - by up to 10% for many investors. If you invested in an Isa last year, particularly a tracker fund, you may be disappointed with its performance and think twice about committing up to \u00a37,000 more of your savings this year. But what do the financial advising experts think? Spinning a yarn about how I'd got my fingers burnt in a tracker fund last year, I set out to take a straw poll among independent financial advisers chosen at random. The general consensus is that Isas are still a must if you have the cash. Ian Williams, of Marshall Williams in Horsham, was bullish. He said: \"The fact that the stock market is currently volatile is really irrelevant. An Isa is a tax wrapper, and it's important that you obtain and hold onto this wrapper, because if you miss the opportunity in any given tax year, it's lost for good\". Opinions were divided on where I should put my money. Joanne Russell, of Alexander Forbes' Croydon office, understood my disappointment with last year's tracker, suggesting that I put \u00a33,000 into a cash mini-Isa with the Nationwide, currently paying 6.2%. She faxed me a list of low-risk equity options for another \u00a33,000, including Aberdeen Asset Management's fixed-interest Isa, Newton's High Yield Bond and Norwich Union's insurance mini-Isa, into which I could put the last \u00a31,000. Colin Larkin, of Metcalf Moat in Orpington, advised against another tracker fund. He called them \"a high-risk option because of the dominance of high technology shares in the FTSE\". A managed fund, despite higher charges, is a better option; the stock market fall means now is a good time to invest. Isas are ideal for a 10-to 15-year period, he said, and now we are in a global economy a \"themed\" fund would be a good option. Judith Kirk, of Partridge Muir &amp; Warren in Tolworth, Surrey, also stressed the tax advantages of Isas and said I would be wrong to be put off by the short-term volatility of equities. She thought I should opt for a \"more conventional growth fund to balance the volatility of the tracker fund\" I said I'd bought last year. She favoured either Jupiter's, Deutsche's or ABN Ambro's UK Growth funds, or Fidelity's Wealthbuilder. Colin Peck of Berry Birch &amp; Noble in West Wickham, Kent, sensibly suggested that a good way to invest, if I was slightly cautious, was to choose an Isa fund manager that allows you to \"drip feed\" the money in. As long as you hand over the full \u00a37,000 to the fund managers before the end of the tax year, it counted as this year's allowance. They hold the money in a deposit account, earning a modest rate of interest, and pay into your Isa in regular instalments, so not all the money is invested when prices are high. All agreed that no one can predict with certainty how the stock market will perform over the next year, but most said \"City experts\" were predicting a rise of around 7%. We'll see.",

      "body": "<p>Japan yesterday woke up to the news its policymakers had been dreading for years with a government warning that the country was infected with deflation. </p> <p>For the first time in the postwar era, the government recognised the presence of this disease in its monthly health check of the world's second largest economy, which has been weakened by a vicious circle of sluggish spending, falling prices and shrinking corporate profits. </p> <p>Japan's consumer price index fell 0.4% in 2000 after a 0.3% fall the previous year - meeting the international definition for deflation, which is two consecutive annual declines in prices. </p> <p>Taro Aso, state minister for economic and fiscal policy, said the condition was \"mild\", but he warned that its psychological impact could grow. </p> <p>No other developed economy is suffering from deflation, which was last seen on a global scale during the great depression of the 1930s. </p> <p>\"Internationally and historically, it is very rare for the consumer price index to fall for two years in a row,\" said cabinet office economist Haruhito Arai, who diagnosed the trend as \"virulent.\" </p> <p>The cabinet office downgraded its assessment of the economy, which is bigger than the rest of Asia combined, for the second consecutive month. </p> <p>Its monthly report said Japan had \"paused\" - a term last used in January 1998, shortly before a currency, stock market and banking crisis that threat ened to undermine the global financial system. </p> <p>While insisting that the economy was still on a long-term course towards growth, the cabinet office report blamed downward pressure on external factors such as the slowdown in the United States and many export-dependent Asian economies. </p> <p>But it could not entirely ignore domestic factors. A combination of rising un employment and renewed concerns about the banking sector is dampening consumers' urge to splurge. </p> <p>The sharp decline of share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange since the start of the year has raised doubts about the health of many banks, who need unrealised gains on their stock holdings to write off an estimated 30 trillion yen (\u00a3171bn) in non-performing loans.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Japan yesterday woke up to the news its policymakers had been dreading for years with a government warning that the country was infected with deflation. For the first time in the postwar era, the government recognised the presence of this disease in its monthly health check of the world's second largest economy, which has been weakened by a vicious circle of sluggish spending, falling prices and shrinking corporate profits. Japan's consumer price index fell 0.4% in 2000 after a 0.3% fall the previous year - meeting the international definition for deflation, which is two consecutive annual declines in prices. Taro Aso, state minister for economic and fiscal policy, said the condition was \"mild\", but he warned that its psychological impact could grow. No other developed economy is suffering from deflation, which was last seen on a global scale during the great depression of the 1930s. \"Internationally and historically, it is very rare for the consumer price index to fall for two years in a row,\" said cabinet office economist Haruhito Arai, who diagnosed the trend as \"virulent.\" The cabinet office downgraded its assessment of the economy, which is bigger than the rest of Asia combined, for the second consecutive month. Its monthly report said Japan had \"paused\" - a term last used in January 1998, shortly before a currency, stock market and banking crisis that threat ened to undermine the global financial system. While insisting that the economy was still on a long-term course towards growth, the cabinet office report blamed downward pressure on external factors such as the slowdown in the United States and many export-dependent Asian economies. But it could not entirely ignore domestic factors. A combination of rising un employment and renewed concerns about the banking sector is dampening consumers' urge to splurge. The sharp decline of share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange since the start of the year has raised doubts about the health of many banks, who need unrealised gains on their stock holdings to write off an estimated 30 trillion yen (\u00a3171bn) in non-performing loans.",

      "body": "<p>Even in the hoariest circles of the British establishment, clubs do not come much more exclusive than the Royal Society. Its very name speaks of prior claim. Not the Royal Society of anything. Money or looks will not buy membership of this elite academy of science, an honour so craved that distinguished researchers have been reduced to nervous wrecks in anticipation. </p> <p>Peerages can be bought. Good connections can open many doors. But only brains can get you the right to put the magical letters FRS - Fellow of the Royal Society - after your name. So it was thought. Now the venerable institution is aquiver from the suggestion that even brains may not be enough. </p> <p>It is a difficult accusation to ignore: it comes from the new president, the outspoken former government chief scientist Sir Robert May. He is asking, clearly and publicly, why the society has only 44 women out of 1,200 fellows; whether there is a bias towards Oxford and Cambridge; and why some of the highest achievers in non-traditional disciplines, such as information technology, have been passed over. He cited Tim Berners-Lee, the Briton who invented the internet in the form we use it today. Last year the society gave him a medal, but it never occurred to anyone to suggest he be made a fellow. </p> <p>\"That's a concrete example of somebody who, while working in a powerhouse of mainstream science - the European particle physics laboratory, CERN, in Switzerland - was doing something that wasn't in the mainstream,\" said Sir Robert. \"So nobody thought to nominate him. People do slip between the cracks.\" </p> <p>Sir Robert will not be drawn on other specific omissions. But it is striking how few of the British scientists whom the public have heard of are fellows. The astrophysicist Stephen Hawking is a fellow. So is Sir John Sulston who led the British end of the international project to sequence the human genome. But Richard Dawkins, the biologist and author of The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker, is not. Nor is Susan Greenfield, the distinguished pharmacologist and broadcaster. Nor is the in vitro fertilisation guru Lord Robert Winston. </p> <p><strong> Public forum</strong><br> </p> <p> Sir Robert, who took over as president in December, promises to take forward reforms quietly set in motion by his predecessor, Aaron Klug. He wants to bring back an old rule whereby popularisers of science, such as David Attenborough, could be made fellows. \"We need to create an additional mechanism that recognises that as one of the legitimate categories for inclusion to the society.\" \" </p> <p>He wants to turn the society from a decorous, aloof body of the wise into the leading public forum of scientific debate. \"I'm unhappy, as many of the fellows are, about the small number of women in the society. There are only 16 under the age of 65 who live in the UK, compared with about 400 men. Are we being aggressive enough in nominating women, or people from universities that aren't Oxford and Cambridge?\" </p> <p>Founded in the 17th century, the Royal Society has had Samuel Pepys, Christopher Wren and Ernest Rutherford among its past presidents. Isaac Newton was president for 24 years. It occupies one of the grandest addresses in London, a palatial building near Pall Mall which housed the pre-war German embassy. </p> <p>Joining the Royal Society is hard. When Dorothy Hodgkin discovered the structure of penicillin, an eminent male colleague, John Bernal, told her she would win the Nobel Prize. She said she would rather be an FRS, like he was. \"That's more difficult,\" said Bernal. </p> <p>Eventually Hodgkin won both honours, but waiting to be elected takes its toll on the scientific elite. \"There is a disease called FRSitis, in which people become absolutely twitchy, because it's seen as a matter of such great prestige,\" said one female fellow. \"There really are people who worry about it terribly. They make themselves quite ill; they become anxious, depressed, miserable, impossible to live with.\" </p> <p>Sir Robert is familiar with the condition: \"The initials do carry a huge prestige. And in Britain, which is very good at creating snobby hierarchies, they're probably invested with more psychic significance than is healthy,\" he said. \"But they do that because they stand for a society that articulates the highest standards of science.\" </p> <p>Steve Jones, professor of genetics at University College London and a high-profile writer and broadcaster on evolution, said he was \"too thick\" to be elected an FRS, but was grateful to the society for giving him his first research grant. \"A fellowship of the Royal Society is a genuine scientific honour,\" he said. \"I think everybody in the society more or less deserves to be in it.\" He added that the Royal Society was less stuck in the mud than the equivalent US or French academies. \"Any organisation that elects its members is bound to have a time lag before it catches up with changes in society. It went through a phase of being, 'Look at me, I'm in the Royal Society!', and it wasn't clear what it was for. But it really has got away from that now.\" </p> <p>Reforms under way are likely to bring in scientists well known to the public who would in the past have fallen below the bar of exceptional achievement set by traditional fellows. Electing more women will be harder, say insiders, because so many drop out before reaching the big league. They fall victim to abysmal child care facilities and the reluctance of British husbands to follow wives to new academic posts. One female society fellow said: \"What we have to do is increase the proportion of women who persist in the system long enough to reach the level of seniority and distinction where they are eligible to be elected.\" </p> <p>The society, which is funded by the government, has little in common with a London club; its Carlton House Terrace base has a restaurant but no bar, and its small fellows' room is usually empty. It hands out research grants and awards (Greenfield and Jones have won medals for contributing to the public understanding of science) and increasingly tries to get parliament and the public to understand the science behind explosive issues such as stem cell research. </p> <p>Sir Robert argues that if the Royal Society is to take the role as the key voice of science in public debate it has to broaden its membership. \"The society needs to look at a larger role in the dialogue between science and the world, in the discussion of the way science offers possibilities to shape the world we want.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Even in the hoariest circles of the British establishment, clubs do not come much more exclusive than the Royal Society. Its very name speaks of prior claim. Not the Royal Society of anything. Money or looks will not buy membership of this elite academy of science, an honour so craved that distinguished researchers have been reduced to nervous wrecks in anticipation. Peerages can be bought. Good connections can open many doors. But only brains can get you the right to put the magical letters FRS - Fellow of the Royal Society - after your name. So it was thought. Now the venerable institution is aquiver from the suggestion that even brains may not be enough. It is a difficult accusation to ignore: it comes from the new president, the outspoken former government chief scientist Sir Robert May. He is asking, clearly and publicly, why the society has only 44 women out of 1,200 fellows; whether there is a bias towards Oxford and Cambridge; and why some of the highest achievers in non-traditional disciplines, such as information technology, have been passed over. He cited Tim Berners-Lee, the Briton who invented the internet in the form we use it today. Last year the society gave him a medal, but it never occurred to anyone to suggest he be made a fellow. \"That's a concrete example of somebody who, while working in a powerhouse of mainstream science - the European particle physics laboratory, CERN, in Switzerland - was doing something that wasn't in the mainstream,\" said Sir Robert. \"So nobody thought to nominate him. People do slip between the cracks.\" Sir Robert will not be drawn on other specific omissions. But it is striking how few of the British scientists whom the public have heard of are fellows. The astrophysicist Stephen Hawking is a fellow. So is Sir John Sulston who led the British end of the international project to sequence the human genome. But Richard Dawkins, the biologist and author of The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker, is not. Nor is Susan Greenfield, the distinguished pharmacologist and broadcaster. Nor is the in vitro fertilisation guru Lord Robert Winston. Public forum Sir Robert, who took over as president in December, promises to take forward reforms quietly set in motion by his predecessor, Aaron Klug. He wants to bring back an old rule whereby popularisers of science, such as David Attenborough, could be made fellows. \"We need to create an additional mechanism that recognises that as one of the legitimate categories for inclusion to the society.\" \" He wants to turn the society from a decorous, aloof body of the wise into the leading public forum of scientific debate. \"I'm unhappy, as many of the fellows are, about the small number of women in the society. There are only 16 under the age of 65 who live in the UK, compared with about 400 men. Are we being aggressive enough in nominating women, or people from universities that aren't Oxford and Cambridge?\" Founded in the 17th century, the Royal Society has had Samuel Pepys, Christopher Wren and Ernest Rutherford among its past presidents. Isaac Newton was president for 24 years. It occupies one of the grandest addresses in London, a palatial building near Pall Mall which housed the pre-war German embassy. Joining the Royal Society is hard. When Dorothy Hodgkin discovered the structure of penicillin, an eminent male colleague, John Bernal, told her she would win the Nobel Prize. She said she would rather be an FRS, like he was. \"That's more difficult,\" said Bernal. Eventually Hodgkin won both honours, but waiting to be elected takes its toll on the scientific elite. \"There is a disease called FRSitis, in which people become absolutely twitchy, because it's seen as a matter of such great prestige,\" said one female fellow. \"There really are people who worry about it terribly. They make themselves quite ill; they become anxious, depressed, miserable, impossible to live with.\" Sir Robert is familiar with the condition: \"The initials do carry a huge prestige. And in Britain, which is very good at creating snobby hierarchies, they're probably invested with more psychic significance than is healthy,\" he said. \"But they do that because they stand for a society that articulates the highest standards of science.\" Steve Jones, professor of genetics at University College London and a high-profile writer and broadcaster on evolution, said he was \"too thick\" to be elected an FRS, but was grateful to the society for giving him his first research grant. \"A fellowship of the Royal Society is a genuine scientific honour,\" he said. \"I think everybody in the society more or less deserves to be in it.\" He added that the Royal Society was less stuck in the mud than the equivalent US or French academies. \"Any organisation that elects its members is bound to have a time lag before it catches up with changes in society. It went through a phase of being, 'Look at me, I'm in the Royal Society!', and it wasn't clear what it was for. But it really has got away from that now.\" Reforms under way are likely to bring in scientists well known to the public who would in the past have fallen below the bar of exceptional achievement set by traditional fellows. Electing more women will be harder, say insiders, because so many drop out before reaching the big league. They fall victim to abysmal child care facilities and the reluctance of British husbands to follow wives to new academic posts. One female society fellow said: \"What we have to do is increase the proportion of women who persist in the system long enough to reach the level of seniority and distinction where they are eligible to be elected.\" The society, which is funded by the government, has little in common with a London club; its Carlton House Terrace base has a restaurant but no bar, and its small fellows' room is usually empty. It hands out research grants and awards (Greenfield and Jones have won medals for contributing to the public understanding of science) and increasingly tries to get parliament and the public to understand the science behind explosive issues such as stem cell research. Sir Robert argues that if the Royal Society is to take the role as the key voice of science in public debate it has to broaden its membership. \"The society needs to look at a larger role in the dialogue between science and the world, in the discussion of the way science offers possibilities to shape the world we want.\"",

We were stepping out of the porno home - on to the porno patio with its porno pool. This was Malibu. Down the slope and beyond the road lay the Pacific Ocean; but the Staglianos have no access to its porno shore, in the evening they can watch the porno sunset with its porno pink and mauve and blood-orange, and then linger awhile, perhaps, under a porno moon. \"Answer me something. How do you account for the emphasis, not just in your . . . work but in the industry in general, how do you account for the truly incredible emphasis on anal sex?\"</p> <p>After a minimal shrug and a minimal pause Stagliano said, \"Pussies are bullshit.\" Now John was being obedient to the dictionary definition of \"bullshit\" which is nonsense intended to deceive.</p> <p>With vaginal, Stagliano elaborated - well, here you have some chick chirruping away. And the genuinely discerning viewer (jack-knifed over his flying fist) has got to be thinking: Is this for real? Or is it just bullshit? </p> <p>With anal, on the other hand, the actress is obliged to produce a different order of response: more guttural, more animal. As Stagliano quaintly puts it, \"Her personality comes out.\" He goes on: \"You want guys who can fuck really good and make the girls look more . . . virile.\" Virile of course, means manly; but once again Stagliano is using the King's English. You want the girls to show you \"their testosterone\". </p> <p>The name of Rocco Siffredi, again and again, was wistfully and reverently conjured. Rocco, the big-dorked Italian, and porno's premier buttbanger or assbuster (to use the dialect of this tribe).</p> <p>\"Rocco has far more power in this industry than any actress,\" said Stagliano, pleased to be pulling one back for the boys (generally speaking, men are the also-rans of porno). \"I was the first to shoot Rocco. Together we evolved toward rougher stuff. He started to spit on girls. A strong male-dominant thing, with women being pushed to their limit. It looks like violence but it's not. I mean, pleasure and pain are the same thing, right? Rocco is driven by the market. What makes it in today's market place is reality.\" And assholes are reality. And pussies are bullshit.</p> <p><strong>Features and gonzo</strong></p> <p>There are, at present, two types of mainstream American pornography: Features and Gonzo. Features are sex films with some sort of claim to the ordinary narrative: characterisation, storyline. \"We don't just show you people fucking,\" said a Features executive. \"We show you why they're fucking.\" These movies are allegedly aimed at the \"couples market\". Couples, it asserted, want to know why people are fucking. I can give these couples a three word answer that will hold true in every case: for the money.</p> <p>In Flashpoint (Wicked Pictures), for instance, a bunch of porno stars are dressed up as firefighters. As the film opens, we see the porno stars sliding down the pole and boarding the crimson firetruck. An exploding car, a colleague (not a porno star but an ageing extra) falling in the line of duty. There follows an insanely boring funeral, which includes the whole of the Lord's Prayer and the slow and solemn furling, by a porno star, of the American flag. Porno star Jenna grieves for the fallen extra. After returning from the funeral she finds herself alone with another porno star dressed up as a firefighter. He seeks to assuage her grief, so she gives him a blowjob plus full intercourse. The next sex scene, which occurs about a millennium later, is also triggered by grief counselling. Here a male porno star comforts two female porno stars, one of them anally . . .</p> <p>After a while you begin to think that porno stars, despite being very bad at acting, are very good at acting in one particular only: they can keep a straight face. But then humourlessness, universal and institutionalised humourlessness, is the lifeblood of porno. Films like Flashpoint go out to the video stores and, in the soft version (where the hard action is partly obscured by some stray object - a fireman's hat, say, or a fireman's boot), are sold to cable and to hotel chain franchises, and so on. Features owes the humiliating fatuity of its conventions to an old legal precedent called the \"Miller Test\". </p> <p>Miller v California (1973) established that a dirty movie was obscene if it was \"utterly\" without social, literary, artistic, political or scientific \"value\". In juridical terms, the key word here, of course, is \"utterly\" and millions of dollars have been spent on its definition.</p> <p>With a wife like Hillary, Bill Clinton could never be a true pal of porno, but he largely left it alone on First Amendment grounds. Unlike his two predecessors, who systematically harassed the industry with confiscations, multiple prosecutions, fines, jail terms. It's a fair guess that porno never felt more gorgeously secure than when Clinton, in his second term, became in effect the porno president.</p> <p>Now porno is tensed and braced forchanges. It feared Gore. It dreaded Bush. Gonzo porno is also known as \"wall-to-wall\". It shows you people fucking without concerning itself with why they're fucking. There are no Lord's Prayers, no furled American flags in Gonzo. Features porno is much, much dirtier than it used to be, but Gonzo porno is gonzo: way out there. The new element is violence.</p> <p><strong>Strength and Pain</strong></p> <p>I had lunch with Temptress (Features). I had lunch with Chloe (Gonzo). And the next day I joined Chloe on the set of Welcum To Chloeville.</p> <p>My lunch with Temptress was a relatively sedate affair. At first I was reminded of the time I interviewed Penny Baker, a Playboy Playmate of the Year: within a minute I had run out of questions. Temptress, like Penny, seemed to be inhibited by the presence of a company executive - in this case Steve Orenstein of Wicked Pictures, for which she is a contract player. But Temptress loosened up.</p> <p>\"Tell me, Temptress,\" I said (having apologised for the corniness and mild hostility of my inquiry), \"what won't you do?\"</p> <p>\"I won't do anal,\" said Temptress. \"They keep trying to coax me into it. You know: 'Just a finger or a tongue. Or just a little bit: just the tip.' But I won't, I used not to do facials. But I do them now.\"</p> <p>Temptress is not talking about beauty treatments. She is talking about the destination of what is variously referred to as the \"pop-shot\" or the \"money-shot\": the ejaculation of the male.</p> <p>\"What happens,\" I asked, \"when a co-star can't get hard?\"</p> <p>The fiasco used to be the nemesis of porno. A penile no-show could make the difference between profit and loss. But the situation has been changed, I was told, thanks to Viagra. On Viagra, the actor performs 45 minutes behind schedule, with a flushed face and a headache. \"You also lose a dimension,\" John Stagliano would explain. \"The guy's fucking without being aroused.\" He's just \"showing off\" - and pretty soon you're back to bullshit.</p> <p>Another thing with Viagra is that the guy can have a problem with the pop-shot, thus endangering the facial.</p> <p>\"What do you do then, Temptress?\"</p> <p>\"You get some pina colada mix. The cock's in your mouth and you let it, like, ooze out around it.\"</p> <p>Physically Temptress reminded me of the daughters of my friends. She didn't sound shy, but she looked it. With her long straight hair frequently steered over her shoulders by her slow-moving hands, with her face unglazed by cosmetics, with her gently narrowed eyes, she exuded what Philip Larkin called the \"strength and pain/Of being young\". I asked about her history and she told me something of it. And there was strength and there was pain (and there was certainly youth: Temptress is 21).</p> <p>\"But I don't want you to write about that. And could you not mention my real name? . . . I don't have relationships any more. They make life unstable. The only sex I have is the sex on screen.\"</p> <p>Temptress is one of the lucky ones. She's a star. After lunch I went to Wicked Pictures and had a talk with Jonathan Morgan (performer turned director) in a computerised cutting-room while he edited his latest Feature, a fantastically unfunny comedy called Inside Porn.</p> <p>\"Ah,\" said Jonathan. \"Now here we have a double anal.\"</p> <p>A double anal is not to be confused with a DP (double penetration: anal and vaginal). A double anal is a double anal. And there have been triple anals, too. \"The girls could be graded like A, B and C. The A is the chick on the boxcover. She has the power. So she'll show up late or not at all. Ninety-nine point nine per cent of them do that.\" He gestured at the screen and said, \"Here you have a borderline A/B doing a double anal. Directors will remember that. She'll get phone calls. For a double anal you'd usually expect a B or a C. They have to do the dirty stuff or they won't get a phone call. You've had a kid, you've got some stretchmarks - you're up there doing double anal.</p> <p>\"Some girls are used in nine months or a year. An 18-year-old, sweet young thing, signs with an agency, makes five films in her first week. Five directors, five actors, five times five: she gets phone calls. A hundred movies in four months. She's not a fresh face any more. Her price slips and she stops </p> <p>getting phone calls. Then it's, 'Okay, will you do anal? Will you do gangbangs?' Then they're used up. They can't even get a phone call. The market forces of this industry use them up.\"</p> <p>I thanked Jonathan Morgan for his candour. But he wasn't as candid as Chloe. We met in the lobby of my hotel and we strolled out to her Mustang.</p> <p>\"See that?\"</p> <p>The number plate said: STR82NL</p> <p>\"Straight to anal,\" said Chloe.</p> <p>And she hadn't even got started.</p> <p>Chloe was gonzo. She gave me the truth.</p> <p><strong>Extreme Productions</strong></p> <p>A single issue of Adult Video News (April 2000) yields the following. Last October porno star Vivian Valentine attended the XXX-Treme Adults Only vacation in Mexico sporting the black eye she copped from Jon Dough on Rough Sex (Anabolic Video). </p> <p>\"I have no regrets or bad feelings about it,\" she said. Regan Starr who worked on the second film in this \"line\", Rough Sex 2, had a different take. \"I got the shit kicked out of me,\" she said. \"I was told before the video - and they said this very proudly, mind you - that in this line most of the girls start crying because they're hurting so bad . . . I couldn't breathe. I was being hit and choked. I was really upset, and they didn't stop. They kept filming. You can hear me say, 'Turn the fucking camera off', and they kept going.\" The director of the Rough Sex series (now discontinued), who goes by the name of Khan Tusion, protests his innocence. \"Regan Starr,\" Tusion claims, \"categorically misstates what occurred.\"</p> <p>If you don't like Khan Tusion, you won't like Max Hardcore. AVN's regular \"On the Set\" column carries a cheerfully scandalised account of the making of Hollywood Hardcore 13. In this scene, actor-director Hardcore is having rough sex with Cloey Adams, who is pretending to be under age. \"If you're a good girl, I'll take you to McDonald's later and get you a Happy Meal.\" Hardcore then \"proceeds to piss in her mouth\". Addressing the camera, Cloey Adams says, \"What do you think of your little princess now Daddy?\" Nor is Hardcore through with her. \"Turning to the crew, he calmly says, 'I'll need a speculum and a hose' . . . One of Max's favourite tricks is to stretch a girl's asshole with a speculum, then piss into her open gape and make her suck out his own piss with a hose. Ain't that romantic?\"</p> <p>Now. American porno (and how could it be otherwise?) is market-driven. We can see what the above tells us about porno. But what does it tell us about America? And if America is more like a world than a country, what does it tell us about the world?</p> <p>\u2022 The average American spends three hours and 51 minutes of every day watching porno (video and internet). </p> <p>\u2022 The average non-homeowning American male spends more on porno than he spends on his rent. </p> <p>\u2022 Porno accounts for 43.5% of the US Gross Domestic Product.</p> <p>Like pussies, these statistic are bullshit. </p> <p>I made them up. But the true figures are similarly wild, similarly dizzying, similarly through-the-roof. This isn't bullshit.</p> <p>\u2022 Porno is far bigger than rock music and far bigger than Hollywood. </p> <p>\u2022 Americans spend more on strip clubs than they spend on theatre, opera, ballet, jazz and classical concerts combined. </p> <p>\u2022 In 1975 the total retail value of all the hard-core porno in America was estimated at $5-10 million. Last year Americans spent $8 billion on mediated sex.</p> <p>Whatever porno is, whatever porno does, you may regret it, but you cannot reject it. To paraphrase Falstaff: Banish porno, and you banish all the world.</p> <p><strong>Chloe</strong></p> <p>\"I have herpes,\" said Chloe as she drove me to a smoker-friendly bar. \"After you've been in this business for a while, you have herpes. Everyone has herpes. On the set sometimes you'll say to a guy, 'What's this?' And he'll say, 'What? That? It's a fuck sore.' And it may well be a fuck sore, what with all the traffic. But it's more likely to be a herpes sore, and that guy shouldn't be working. My movies are all-condom, but condoms won't protect you from herpes. They don't cover the base. Sometimes when you're doing girl-girl you'll say, 'Honey, I think you should go and see someone.' It can be a very stinky scene down there. I'll send her to a porno-friendly doctor (the others treat you like shit) and she'll come out holding her Flagyll prescription with multiple refills.\"</p> <p>Chloe is 26. For 10 years she trained as a ballerina; then, at 17, she got into drugs, mostly speed (\"I'd fuck for 72 hours\"); at 20 she started shooting up heroin and was already in the industry by the time she quit, over two years ago. Chloe has fair, fine red hair and a warm and clever face. She has a ballerina's body: strong legs, a full muscular butt -</p> <p>\"- and no tits. It's true that some Features companies urge the girls to have implants and offer to pay for it. On the road [ie, stripping] girls used to boast about the cubic capacity of their titjobs. 'I've got 840s.' 'I've got 1220s'. One of them turned to me and said, 'Get tits or suck cock.' I'd rather suck cock, I really would.\"</p> <p>If you're going to be a porno star, what do you need? It's pretty clear by now. You need to be an exhibitionist. You need to have a ferocious sex drive. You need to suffer from nostalgie de la boue (literally \"mud nostalgia\": a childish, even babyish delight in bodily functions and wastes). And - probably - you need damage in your past. You also need to be humourless. Chloe is not humourless. When she talked to me she was like someone peeping over a wall demarcating two different worlds, telling me stories about the other side.</p> <p>\"I like to be peed on. I like being spat on: it feels like come on your chest. I like to be choked. I like to be fisted. Here we have the 'no-thumbs' rule? A girl can have 16 fingers up her. But no thumbs.\" She laughs, and continues: \"For vaginal I prefer a girthy kind of dick. And some of these guys\" - Chloe seizes the broad base of a water glass on the table before us - \"are like this. For anal I prefer a longer, thinner kind of dick.\"</p> <p>\"So when you do DP you get one thick one and one thin one.\"</p> <p>\"Right . . . No. Come to think of it,\" she said brightly, \"I get two thick ones. I like to feel crammed. You know, I did my first anal for $200? I still can't believe that.\"</p> <p>\"And what are your rates now, Chloe?\"</p> <p>\"In Gonzo, you're paid, not by the picture, but by the scene. So it's girl-girl: 700, plus 100 for an anal toy. Boy-girl: 900. Anal: 1,100. Solo [a rarity]: 500. DP: 1,500. I won't do anal fisting or double anal. People ask me how I can hang on to my title as Anal Queen of LA when I won't do double anal. But I have hung on to it.\"</p> <p>In common with about 10% of the porno girls (her estimate), Chloe retains the approval of her parents (and so does Temptress). In fact, Chloe's guardians are gonzo. She recently shot a film out near their place, and her stepfather (while absenting himself from his stepdaughter's scenes) \"was like a towel-boy\". And Chloe's mother, for two years running now, has marched out of the AVN Awards, brandishing Chloe's Best Anal trophies above the heads of the crowd.</p> <p>After lunch we drove to Chloe's apartment: barred gates, the feel of a two-floor motel, a modest, comfortable, orderly apartment, featuring a cute black cat with a porno name, Siren. Chloe thinks that some porno girls get their names by looking out of the window at the road sign: Laurel Canyon, Chandler, Cherry Mirage.</p> <p>For a while Chloe talked about her love life. She is torn, at present, between the neglectful Chris, a rock musician (bass), and the attentive Artie, a fellow performer. She suspects that Chris just strings her along because it's a status symbol for a rock star to have a porno-star girlfriend. Chris, I think, knows about Artie. But Artie doesn't know about Chris.</p> <p>\"And with Artie, he comes over and I'm horny as hell and he says, 'I can't, I have to do two scenes tomorrow.' \"</p> <p>\"With private sex, is there a crossover in your head?\"</p> <p>\"Oh yeah. I find myself thinking, 'Fuck. I should be being paid for this.' Or 'Fuck. I wish I had a camera.'\"</p> <p>\"I'd better not write about Chris and Artie.\"</p> <p>\"Go ahead. They'll both be over anyway. Here, it doesn't last.\"</p> <p>Chloe was unforgettable. I won't forget the way she said this (she said it with sorrowful resolve): \"We're prostitutes . . . There are differences. You can choose your partners, and they're tested for Aids - you won't get your john to do that. But we're prostitutes: we exchange sex for money.\"</p> <p>\"You've thought this through.\"</p> <p>\"I looked it up in the dictionary and that's what it says.\"</p> <p>In etymological terms pornography is what I'm doing: I'm writing about whores. I will see Chloe on set tomorrow morning. The scene they'll be shooting? Gonzo girl-boy-girl anal.</p> <p><strong>Mister Monster</strong></p> <p>Towards the end of Rabbit At Rest, John Updike writes: Rabbit thinks of adding $5.50 to his bill to watch something called Horny Housewives . . . The trouble with these softcore porn movies on hotel circuits, in case some four-year-old with lawyers for parents happens to hit the right buttons they show tits and ass and even some pubic hair but no real cunt and no pricks, no pricks hard or soft at all. It's very frustrating. It turns out pricks are what we care about, you have to see them. Maybe we're all queer, and all his life he's been in love with Ronnie Harrison.</p> <p>Or, as a friend would put it to me later that week: It's no good without Mister Monster. You must have Mister Monster.Must you? Gore Vidal once said that the only danger in watching pornography is that it might make you want to watch more pornography; it might make you want to do nothing else but watch pornography. There is, I contend, another danger. As I sampled some extreme productions on the VCR in my hotel room, I kept worrying about something. I kept worrying that I'd like it. Porno services the \"polymorphous perverse\": the near-infinite chaos of human desire. If you harbour a perversity, then sooner or later porno will identify it. You'd better hope that this doesn't happen while you're watching a film about a coprophagic pigfarmer - or an undertaker. That week in Los Angeles I found out what I don't like. </p> <p>I don't like Mister Monster.</p> <p>High up in higgledy-piggledy Hollywood Hills, I hobnobbed with Andrew Blake, the Truffaut of porno, and two incredibly beautiful girls in incredibly expensive underwear (and six inch heels).</p> <p> Strictly speaking, Blake's work is Gonzo: scriptless, storyless, with the performers interacting with the camera. But Blake is pre-eminently \"high-end\". His actresses look like voluptuous fashion models, and he flatters and glorifies them on the screen, with oils, unguents, silks, cords, ribbons, textures. </p> <p>\"I hired Monica because she has these beautiful breasts,\" he told me, \"and that's what we're going to be concentrating on. I've never worked with Adriana before but she seems to be really something.\"</p> <p>Laconic, gruff, direct and, of course, humourless, Blake goes about his business.</p> <p>\"Now put your hand into her panties . . . And maybe a nipple comes out, a nipple is revealed? . . . Squeeze them, caress them, do the whole nine yards with them . . . Try opening your legs. Kind of tease the panties . . . Don't smile so much. Just kind of be into yourself . . . So is the bra ready to ride? Kiss the nip . . . Arch up your butt a little more . . . Cross and uncross your legs. Show a little pussy . . . Now this is the panties coming off . . .\"</p> <p>Behold. A platonically perfect pubis, wearing nothing but the latest hairstyle, a minimal mohawk.</p> <p>\"This must be a tough day's work for you,\" said the make-up girl amiably. \"Someone's got to do it. Right?\"</p> <p>Her remark obliged me to examine my \"affect\", or feeling-tone. I admit to a strong sense of furtive beauty-assimiliation. But the instinct being aroused in me was not sexual so much as protective. Naked Adriana was 20 years old. And the last thing I wanted to see, at that moment, was Mister Monster.</p> <p>Outside, during an intermission, Blake said in his flat, declarative style, \"I'm into looking at woman. Not all this 'pissing and fisting'. I've never had any legal problems.\"</p> <p><strong>Work permit</strong></p> <p>A \"tough\" day's work for me, then, and the same could be said for Adriana and Monica. They weren't being slapped around by Khan Tusion or peed on by Max Hardcore. But were they being \"used up\"?</p> <p>If you're a porno performer, your latest HIV test is your work permit. Two years ago the actor Marc Wallice started to become evasive about his work permit. He was using an out of town health centre and seemed to be fudging his results. By the time he was found out, Wallice's condition was fulminant. He infected six actresses.</p> <p>\"The tests we take only test for Aids,\" says Chloe. \"We've contained Aids in the industry but what about all the others? You know we're now up to Hepatitis G?</p> <p>\"You should be at least 21 before you work in this industry. You should know your body, understand your body. But that would wipe out half of San Fernando Valley. There are whole lines on the 18 pluses.\"</p> <p>And there are: Dirty Debutantes, Nasty Newcomers, Filthy First Timers . . .</p> <p>One of the actresses infected by Marc Wallice (his condition now is so pitiful that no one thinks him worthy of persecuting) is Mrs John Stagliano. Stagliano himself, the pioneer of gonzo, is HIV-positive (he contracted the virus recreationally, in a Rio bordello). A medium-sized fortune has been made by Stagliano, in a business where, contrary to popular belief, very few fortunes are made. But I often think of the Staglianos, out by the pool, gazing at an ocean to which they have no access.</p> <p><strong>Gonzo Girl-Boy-Girl</strong></p> <p>Chloe's shoot is on Dolorosa Drive.</p> <p>The porno house, the porno fish in the porno tank (the fish are porno-coloured: yellow, mauve, blood-orange), the porno TV set (as big as a double refrigerator), the porno deck, the porno pool, with a plastic duck floating around in it. Beyond the fence stands the house of the pain-in-the-ass neighbour who keeps climbing on to the roof with a mouthful of nails to get himself shocked enough to call the police.</p> <p>Girl-boy-girl: the girls are Chloe and Lola (a friendly Amerindian-style beauty); the boy is Artie (Chloe's offscreen lover: tattooed, muscular, balding). Artie seems to be a nice guy, but he keeps talking with a jokey French accent. Porno performers are great ones for funny voices, funny faces. German scientists, Russian spies, French connoisseurs; in Features they can keep it up all movie long.</p> <p>There is a crew: the DP (for the time being this means Director of Photography) and the sound-recordist, who go about their business like middle-aged handymen; a plump youth who seems to be there for general work experience; and Chloe's sister, Shannon, caterer and towel-girl. Chloe will soon be calling out to Shannon, \"Stop that phone!\" Shannon: \"It's the home phone! There's like ten of them!\"</p> <p>Artie is giving us more French accent, then more French accent, while Chloe and Lola strip for the \"pretty girl\" shots that will go on the box-cover. Chloe, with whom I spent five hours the previous day, walks past me, naked. It doesn't bother her that she's naked. She doesn't know she's naked.</p> <p>The porno stills by the porno pool. \"See pink? Want lots of pink?\" \"Let's have some booty.\" \"Open it? You want it all?\"</p> <p>It is barely 10 o'clock in the morning, and I am, I realise, experiencing the kind of anxiety that usually precedes a mild ordeal. A line is about to be crossed. I shouldn't be here. None of us should be here. But we all have work to do.</p> <p>Fifteen minutes later, referring to the achievements of Lola, Chloe stabbed a hand through the air at me, and shouted with joy and triumph (Chloe is the director, remember, and she was thrilled to have this scene in the can): \"That's the kind of blowjob I was telling you about yesterday!\"</p> <p>I reeled out into the yard with my notebook, laughing, and shaking my head. There are plenty of \"jokes\" on a porno set, and there is much raucous mirth to dispel tension. But only a Chloe, only an exception, can inject humour. She sounded like Mel Brooks, in The Producers, saying, \"That's our Hitler!\"</p> <p>The kind of blowjob Chloe was telling me about yesterday was this kind of blowjob. It is as if the girl's passionate - indeed desperate - intention is to kiss the boy's lower abdomen. She faces an obstacle. She can't go around it. She has to go through it. \"I mean,\" Chloe had said admiringly, \"some of these girls go down. Drooling and slobbering, saliva everywhere, choking dry-heaving.\" </p> <p>It had to be said that the dry-heaving, from Artie's point of view, was visibly efficacious. When Lola was done, he gazed down with some complacence as Mister Monster went from three o'clock to half past 12.</p> <p>And that was the tenor of it: heat. That is where the market is taking us: toward heat, intensity, a frenzied athleticism. More than this, porno, it seems, is a parody of love. It therefore addresses itself to love's opposites, which are hate and death. \"Choke her!\" \"Spit inside me!\" \"Break me! You can't break me! Try!\" \"COMING!!!\" Chloe screamed this last word like a mother answering a child's cry from the other end of the house. Then, to Lola, \"Choke me!\" And Chloe's entire upper body flushed with pink, and she seemed to swoon . . .</p> <p>\"I wanna piss,\" said Artie, during one of his many intermissions.</p> <p>For a moment the DP's eyes widened in alarm. He thought, wrongly, that Artie wanted to piss on camera. \"Pissing is as bad as coming,\" he confided to me. \"They're supposed to piss and they can't. They go off to the shower, then they say they can piss and they can't.\"</p> <p>Artie trudged back from the can, worriedly nursing his condomed erection. \"God I'm old,\" he muttered, as he headed back to the fray.</p> <p>Well I'm old too, and I blew a kiss at Chloe and took my leave - before the anal and the popshot. Shannon drove me back to the hotel. Poor Shannon: she was having one of those days. First, shopping in a health-food store, she dropped a jar of wheatgerm on her foot and was now limping heavily. Then she discovered that her boyfriend was cheating on her - and she fired him. Contemplating the suspension of her love life, Shannon said sadly, \"And when you compare it to that, the sex doesn't seem much anyway.\" </p> <p>I knew what she meant, in a sense. Chloe-Artie-Lola made me feel like a virgin.</p> <p><a href=\"http://books.theguardian.com/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,6000,458054,00.html\">Continued</a></p>",

We were stepping out of the porno home - on to the porno patio with its porno pool. This was Malibu. Down the slope and beyond the road lay the Pacific Ocean; but the Staglianos have no access to its porno shore, in the evening they can watch the porno sunset with its porno pink and mauve and blood-orange, and then linger awhile, perhaps, under a porno moon. \"Answer me something. How do you account for the emphasis, not just in your . . . work but in the industry in general, how do you account for the truly incredible emphasis on anal sex?\" After a minimal shrug and a minimal pause Stagliano said, \"Pussies are bullshit.\" Now John was being obedient to the dictionary definition of \"bullshit\" which is nonsense intended to deceive. With vaginal, Stagliano elaborated - well, here you have some chick chirruping away. And the genuinely discerning viewer (jack-knifed over his flying fist) has got to be thinking: Is this for real? Or is it just bullshit? With anal, on the other hand, the actress is obliged to produce a different order of response: more guttural, more animal. As Stagliano quaintly puts it, \"Her personality comes out.\" He goes on: \"You want guys who can fuck really good and make the girls look more . . . virile.\" Virile of course, means manly; but once again Stagliano is using the King's English. You want the girls to show you \"their testosterone\". The name of Rocco Siffredi, again and again, was wistfully and reverently conjured. Rocco, the big-dorked Italian, and porno's premier buttbanger or assbuster (to use the dialect of this tribe). \"Rocco has far more power in this industry than any actress,\" said Stagliano, pleased to be pulling one back for the boys (generally speaking, men are the also-rans of porno). \"I was the first to shoot Rocco. Together we evolved toward rougher stuff. He started to spit on girls. A strong male-dominant thing, with women being pushed to their limit. It looks like violence but it's not. I mean, pleasure and pain are the same thing, right? Rocco is driven by the market. What makes it in today's market place is reality.\" And assholes are reality. And pussies are bullshit. Features and gonzo There are, at present, two types of mainstream American pornography: Features and Gonzo. Features are sex films with some sort of claim to the ordinary narrative: characterisation, storyline. \"We don't just show you people fucking,\" said a Features executive. \"We show you why they're fucking.\" These movies are allegedly aimed at the \"couples market\". Couples, it asserted, want to know why people are fucking. I can give these couples a three word answer that will hold true in every case: for the money. In Flashpoint (Wicked Pictures), for instance, a bunch of porno stars are dressed up as firefighters. As the film opens, we see the porno stars sliding down the pole and boarding the crimson firetruck. An exploding car, a colleague (not a porno star but an ageing extra) falling in the line of duty. There follows an insanely boring funeral, which includes the whole of the Lord's Prayer and the slow and solemn furling, by a porno star, of the American flag. Porno star Jenna grieves for the fallen extra. After returning from the funeral she finds herself alone with another porno star dressed up as a firefighter. He seeks to assuage her grief, so she gives him a blowjob plus full intercourse. The next sex scene, which occurs about a millennium later, is also triggered by grief counselling. Here a male porno star comforts two female porno stars, one of them anally . . . After a while you begin to think that porno stars, despite being very bad at acting, are very good at acting in one particular only: they can keep a straight face. But then humourlessness, universal and institutionalised humourlessness, is the lifeblood of porno. Films like Flashpoint go out to the video stores and, in the soft version (where the hard action is partly obscured by some stray object - a fireman's hat, say, or a fireman's boot), are sold to cable and to hotel chain franchises, and so on. Features owes the humiliating fatuity of its conventions to an old legal precedent called the \"Miller Test\". Miller v California (1973) established that a dirty movie was obscene if it was \"utterly\" without social, literary, artistic, political or scientific \"value\". In juridical terms, the key word here, of course, is \"utterly\" and millions of dollars have been spent on its definition. With a wife like Hillary, Bill Clinton could never be a true pal of porno, but he largely left it alone on First Amendment grounds. Unlike his two predecessors, who systematically harassed the industry with confiscations, multiple prosecutions, fines, jail terms. It's a fair guess that porno never felt more gorgeously secure than when Clinton, in his second term, became in effect the porno president. Now porno is tensed and braced forchanges. It feared Gore. It dreaded Bush. Gonzo porno is also known as \"wall-to-wall\". It shows you people fucking without concerning itself with why they're fucking. There are no Lord's Prayers, no furled American flags in Gonzo. Features porno is much, much dirtier than it used to be, but Gonzo porno is gonzo: way out there. The new element is violence. Strength and Pain I had lunch with Temptress (Features). I had lunch with Chloe (Gonzo). And the next day I joined Chloe on the set of Welcum To Chloeville. My lunch with Temptress was a relatively sedate affair. At first I was reminded of the time I interviewed Penny Baker, a Playboy Playmate of the Year: within a minute I had run out of questions. Temptress, like Penny, seemed to be inhibited by the presence of a company executive - in this case Steve Orenstein of Wicked Pictures, for which she is a contract player. But Temptress loosened up. \"Tell me, Temptress,\" I said (having apologised for the corniness and mild hostility of my inquiry), \"what won't you do?\" \"I won't do anal,\" said Temptress. \"They keep trying to coax me into it. You know: 'Just a finger or a tongue. Or just a little bit: just the tip.' But I won't, I used not to do facials. But I do them now.\" Temptress is not talking about beauty treatments. She is talking about the destination of what is variously referred to as the \"pop-shot\" or the \"money-shot\": the ejaculation of the male. \"What happens,\" I asked, \"when a co-star can't get hard?\" The fiasco used to be the nemesis of porno. A penile no-show could make the difference between profit and loss. But the situation has been changed, I was told, thanks to Viagra. On Viagra, the actor performs 45 minutes behind schedule, with a flushed face and a headache. \"You also lose a dimension,\" John Stagliano would explain. \"The guy's fucking without being aroused.\" He's just \"showing off\" - and pretty soon you're back to bullshit. Another thing with Viagra is that the guy can have a problem with the pop-shot, thus endangering the facial. \"What do you do then, Temptress?\" \"You get some pina colada mix. The cock's in your mouth and you let it, like, ooze out around it.\" Physically Temptress reminded me of the daughters of my friends. She didn't sound shy, but she looked it. With her long straight hair frequently steered over her shoulders by her slow-moving hands, with her face unglazed by cosmetics, with her gently narrowed eyes, she exuded what Philip Larkin called the \"strength and pain/Of being young\". I asked about her history and she told me something of it. And there was strength and there was pain (and there was certainly youth: Temptress is 21). \"But I don't want you to write about that. And could you not mention my real name? . . . I don't have relationships any more. They make life unstable. The only sex I have is the sex on screen.\" Temptress is one of the lucky ones. She's a star. After lunch I went to Wicked Pictures and had a talk with Jonathan Morgan (performer turned director) in a computerised cutting-room while he edited his latest Feature, a fantastically unfunny comedy called Inside Porn. \"Ah,\" said Jonathan. \"Now here we have a double anal.\" A double anal is not to be confused with a DP (double penetration: anal and vaginal). A double anal is a double anal. And there have been triple anals, too. \"The girls could be graded like A, B and C. The A is the chick on the boxcover. She has the power. So she'll show up late or not at all. Ninety-nine point nine per cent of them do that.\" He gestured at the screen and said, \"Here you have a borderline A/B doing a double anal. Directors will remember that. She'll get phone calls. For a double anal you'd usually expect a B or a C. They have to do the dirty stuff or they won't get a phone call. You've had a kid, you've got some stretchmarks - you're up there doing double anal. \"Some girls are used in nine months or a year. An 18-year-old, sweet young thing, signs with an agency, makes five films in her first week. Five directors, five actors, five times five: she gets phone calls. A hundred movies in four months. She's not a fresh face any more. Her price slips and she stops getting phone calls. Then it's, 'Okay, will you do anal? Will you do gangbangs?' Then they're used up. They can't even get a phone call. The market forces of this industry use them up.\" I thanked Jonathan Morgan for his candour. But he wasn't as candid as Chloe. We met in the lobby of my hotel and we strolled out to her Mustang. \"See that?\" The number plate said: STR82NL \"Straight to anal,\" said Chloe. And she hadn't even got started. Chloe was gonzo. She gave me the truth. Extreme Productions A single issue of Adult Video News (April 2000) yields the following. Last October porno star Vivian Valentine attended the XXX-Treme Adults Only vacation in Mexico sporting the black eye she copped from Jon Dough on Rough Sex (Anabolic Video). \"I have no regrets or bad feelings about it,\" she said. Regan Starr who worked on the second film in this \"line\", Rough Sex 2, had a different take. \"I got the shit kicked out of me,\" she said. \"I was told before the video - and they said this very proudly, mind you - that in this line most of the girls start crying because they're hurting so bad . . . I couldn't breathe. I was being hit and choked. I was really upset, and they didn't stop. They kept filming. You can hear me say, 'Turn the fucking camera off', and they kept going.\" The director of the Rough Sex series (now discontinued), who goes by the name of Khan Tusion, protests his innocence. \"Regan Starr,\" Tusion claims, \"categorically misstates what occurred.\" If you don't like Khan Tusion, you won't like Max Hardcore. AVN's regular \"On the Set\" column carries a cheerfully scandalised account of the making of Hollywood Hardcore 13. In this scene, actor-director Hardcore is having rough sex with Cloey Adams, who is pretending to be under age. \"If you're a good girl, I'll take you to McDonald's later and get you a Happy Meal.\" Hardcore then \"proceeds to piss in her mouth\". Addressing the camera, Cloey Adams says, \"What do you think of your little princess now Daddy?\" Nor is Hardcore through with her. \"Turning to the crew, he calmly says, 'I'll need a speculum and a hose' . . . One of Max's favourite tricks is to stretch a girl's asshole with a speculum, then piss into her open gape and make her suck out his own piss with a hose. Ain't that romantic?\" Now. American porno (and how could it be otherwise?) is market-driven. We can see what the above tells us about porno. But what does it tell us about America? And if America is more like a world than a country, what does it tell us about the world? \u2022 The average American spends three hours and 51 minutes of every day watching porno (video and internet). \u2022 The average non-homeowning American male spends more on porno than he spends on his rent. \u2022 Porno accounts for 43.5% of the US Gross Domestic Product. Like pussies, these statistic are bullshit. I made them up. But the true figures are similarly wild, similarly dizzying, similarly through-the-roof. This isn't bullshit. \u2022 Porno is far bigger than rock music and far bigger than Hollywood. \u2022 Americans spend more on strip clubs than they spend on theatre, opera, ballet, jazz and classical concerts combined. \u2022 In 1975 the total retail value of all the hard-core porno in America was estimated at $5-10 million. Last year Americans spent $8 billion on mediated sex. Whatever porno is, whatever porno does, you may regret it, but you cannot reject it. To paraphrase Falstaff: Banish porno, and you banish all the world. Chloe \"I have herpes,\" said Chloe as she drove me to a smoker-friendly bar. \"After you've been in this business for a while, you have herpes. Everyone has herpes. On the set sometimes you'll say to a guy, 'What's this?' And he'll say, 'What? That? It's a fuck sore.' And it may well be a fuck sore, what with all the traffic. But it's more likely to be a herpes sore, and that guy shouldn't be working. My movies are all-condom, but condoms won't protect you from herpes. They don't cover the base. Sometimes when you're doing girl-girl you'll say, 'Honey, I think you should go and see someone.' It can be a very stinky scene down there. I'll send her to a porno-friendly doctor (the others treat you like shit) and she'll come out holding her Flagyll prescription with multiple refills.\" Chloe is 26. For 10 years she trained as a ballerina; then, at 17, she got into drugs, mostly speed (\"I'd fuck for 72 hours\"); at 20 she started shooting up heroin and was already in the industry by the time she quit, over two years ago. Chloe has fair, fine red hair and a warm and clever face. She has a ballerina's body: strong legs, a full muscular butt - \"- and no tits. It's true that some Features companies urge the girls to have implants and offer to pay for it. On the road [ie, stripping] girls used to boast about the cubic capacity of their titjobs. 'I've got 840s.' 'I've got 1220s'. One of them turned to me and said, 'Get tits or suck cock.' I'd rather suck cock, I really would.\" If you're going to be a porno star, what do you need? It's pretty clear by now. You need to be an exhibitionist. You need to have a ferocious sex drive. You need to suffer from nostalgie de la boue (literally \"mud nostalgia\": a childish, even babyish delight in bodily functions and wastes). And - probably - you need damage in your past. You also need to be humourless. Chloe is not humourless. When she talked to me she was like someone peeping over a wall demarcating two different worlds, telling me stories about the other side. \"I like to be peed on. I like being spat on: it feels like come on your chest. I like to be choked. I like to be fisted. Here we have the 'no-thumbs' rule? A girl can have 16 fingers up her. But no thumbs.\" She laughs, and continues: \"For vaginal I prefer a girthy kind of dick. And some of these guys\" - Chloe seizes the broad base of a water glass on the table before us - \"are like this. For anal I prefer a longer, thinner kind of dick.\" \"So when you do DP you get one thick one and one thin one.\" \"Right . . . No. Come to think of it,\" she said brightly, \"I get two thick ones. I like to feel crammed. You know, I did my first anal for $200? I still can't believe that.\" \"And what are your rates now, Chloe?\" \"In Gonzo, you're paid, not by the picture, but by the scene. So it's girl-girl: 700, plus 100 for an anal toy. Boy-girl: 900. Anal: 1,100. Solo [a rarity]: 500. DP: 1,500. I won't do anal fisting or double anal. People ask me how I can hang on to my title as Anal Queen of LA when I won't do double anal. But I have hung on to it.\" In common with about 10% of the porno girls (her estimate), Chloe retains the approval of her parents (and so does Temptress). In fact, Chloe's guardians are gonzo. She recently shot a film out near their place, and her stepfather (while absenting himself from his stepdaughter's scenes) \"was like a towel-boy\". And Chloe's mother, for two years running now, has marched out of the AVN Awards, brandishing Chloe's Best Anal trophies above the heads of the crowd. After lunch we drove to Chloe's apartment: barred gates, the feel of a two-floor motel, a modest, comfortable, orderly apartment, featuring a cute black cat with a porno name, Siren. Chloe thinks that some porno girls get their names by looking out of the window at the road sign: Laurel Canyon, Chandler, Cherry Mirage. For a while Chloe talked about her love life. She is torn, at present, between the neglectful Chris, a rock musician (bass), and the attentive Artie, a fellow performer. She suspects that Chris just strings her along because it's a status symbol for a rock star to have a porno-star girlfriend. Chris, I think, knows about Artie. But Artie doesn't know about Chris. \"And with Artie, he comes over and I'm horny as hell and he says, 'I can't, I have to do two scenes tomorrow.' \" \"With private sex, is there a crossover in your head?\" \"Oh yeah. I find myself thinking, 'Fuck. I should be being paid for this.' Or 'Fuck. I wish I had a camera.'\" \"I'd better not write about Chris and Artie.\" \"Go ahead. They'll both be over anyway. Here, it doesn't last.\" Chloe was unforgettable. I won't forget the way she said this (she said it with sorrowful resolve): \"We're prostitutes . . . There are differences. You can choose your partners, and they're tested for Aids - you won't get your john to do that. But we're prostitutes: we exchange sex for money.\" \"You've thought this through.\" \"I looked it up in the dictionary and that's what it says.\" In etymological terms pornography is what I'm doing: I'm writing about whores. I will see Chloe on set tomorrow morning. The scene they'll be shooting? Gonzo girl-boy-girl anal. Mister Monster Towards the end of Rabbit At Rest, John Updike writes: Rabbit thinks of adding $5.50 to his bill to watch something called Horny Housewives . . . The trouble with these softcore porn movies on hotel circuits, in case some four-year-old with lawyers for parents happens to hit the right buttons they show tits and ass and even some pubic hair but no real cunt and no pricks, no pricks hard or soft at all. It's very frustrating. It turns out pricks are what we care about, you have to see them. Maybe we're all queer, and all his life he's been in love with Ronnie Harrison. Or, as a friend would put it to me later that week: It's no good without Mister Monster. You must have Mister Monster.Must you? Gore Vidal once said that the only danger in watching pornography is that it might make you want to watch more pornography; it might make you want to do nothing else but watch pornography. There is, I contend, another danger. As I sampled some extreme productions on the VCR in my hotel room, I kept worrying about something. I kept worrying that I'd like it. Porno services the \"polymorphous perverse\": the near-infinite chaos of human desire. If you harbour a perversity, then sooner or later porno will identify it. You'd better hope that this doesn't happen while you're watching a film about a coprophagic pigfarmer - or an undertaker. That week in Los Angeles I found out what I don't like. I don't like Mister Monster. High up in higgledy-piggledy Hollywood Hills, I hobnobbed with Andrew Blake, the Truffaut of porno, and two incredibly beautiful girls in incredibly expensive underwear (and six inch heels). Strictly speaking, Blake's work is Gonzo: scriptless, storyless, with the performers interacting with the camera. But Blake is pre-eminently \"high-end\". His actresses look like voluptuous fashion models, and he flatters and glorifies them on the screen, with oils, unguents, silks, cords, ribbons, textures. \"I hired Monica because she has these beautiful breasts,\" he told me, \"and that's what we're going to be concentrating on. I've never worked with Adriana before but she seems to be really something.\" Laconic, gruff, direct and, of course, humourless, Blake goes about his business. \"Now put your hand into her panties . . . And maybe a nipple comes out, a nipple is revealed? . . . Squeeze them, caress them, do the whole nine yards with them . . . Try opening your legs. Kind of tease the panties . . . Don't smile so much. Just kind of be into yourself . . . So is the bra ready to ride? Kiss the nip . . . Arch up your butt a little more . . . Cross and uncross your legs. Show a little pussy . . . Now this is the panties coming off . . .\" Behold. A platonically perfect pubis, wearing nothing but the latest hairstyle, a minimal mohawk. \"This must be a tough day's work for you,\" said the make-up girl amiably. \"Someone's got to do it. Right?\" Her remark obliged me to examine my \"affect\", or feeling-tone. I admit to a strong sense of furtive beauty-assimiliation. But the instinct being aroused in me was not sexual so much as protective. Naked Adriana was 20 years old. And the last thing I wanted to see, at that moment, was Mister Monster. Outside, during an intermission, Blake said in his flat, declarative style, \"I'm into looking at woman. Not all this 'pissing and fisting'. I've never had any legal problems.\" Work permit A \"tough\" day's work for me, then, and the same could be said for Adriana and Monica. They weren't being slapped around by Khan Tusion or peed on by Max Hardcore. But were they being \"used up\"? If you're a porno performer, your latest HIV test is your work permit. Two years ago the actor Marc Wallice started to become evasive about his work permit. He was using an out of town health centre and seemed to be fudging his results. By the time he was found out, Wallice's condition was fulminant. He infected six actresses. \"The tests we take only test for Aids,\" says Chloe. \"We've contained Aids in the industry but what about all the others? You know we're now up to Hepatitis G? \"You should be at least 21 before you work in this industry. You should know your body, understand your body. But that would wipe out half of San Fernando Valley. There are whole lines on the 18 pluses.\" And there are: Dirty Debutantes, Nasty Newcomers, Filthy First Timers . . . One of the actresses infected by Marc Wallice (his condition now is so pitiful that no one thinks him worthy of persecuting) is Mrs John Stagliano. Stagliano himself, the pioneer of gonzo, is HIV-positive (he contracted the virus recreationally, in a Rio bordello). A medium-sized fortune has been made by Stagliano, in a business where, contrary to popular belief, very few fortunes are made. But I often think of the Staglianos, out by the pool, gazing at an ocean to which they have no access. Gonzo Girl-Boy-Girl Chloe's shoot is on Dolorosa Drive. The porno house, the porno fish in the porno tank (the fish are porno-coloured: yellow, mauve, blood-orange), the porno TV set (as big as a double refrigerator), the porno deck, the porno pool, with a plastic duck floating around in it. Beyond the fence stands the house of the pain-in-the-ass neighbour who keeps climbing on to the roof with a mouthful of nails to get himself shocked enough to call the police. Girl-boy-girl: the girls are Chloe and Lola (a friendly Amerindian-style beauty); the boy is Artie (Chloe's offscreen lover: tattooed, muscular, balding). Artie seems to be a nice guy, but he keeps talking with a jokey French accent. Porno performers are great ones for funny voices, funny faces. German scientists, Russian spies, French connoisseurs; in Features they can keep it up all movie long. There is a crew: the DP (for the time being this means Director of Photography) and the sound-recordist, who go about their business like middle-aged handymen; a plump youth who seems to be there for general work experience; and Chloe's sister, Shannon, caterer and towel-girl. Chloe will soon be calling out to Shannon, \"Stop that phone!\" Shannon: \"It's the home phone! There's like ten of them!\" Artie is giving us more French accent, then more French accent, while Chloe and Lola strip for the \"pretty girl\" shots that will go on the box-cover. Chloe, with whom I spent five hours the previous day, walks past me, naked. It doesn't bother her that she's naked. She doesn't know she's naked. The porno stills by the porno pool. \"See pink? Want lots of pink?\" \"Let's have some booty.\" \"Open it? You want it all?\" It is barely 10 o'clock in the morning, and I am, I realise, experiencing the kind of anxiety that usually precedes a mild ordeal. A line is about to be crossed. I shouldn't be here. None of us should be here. But we all have work to do. Fifteen minutes later, referring to the achievements of Lola, Chloe stabbed a hand through the air at me, and shouted with joy and triumph (Chloe is the director, remember, and she was thrilled to have this scene in the can): \"That's the kind of blowjob I was telling you about yesterday!\" I reeled out into the yard with my notebook, laughing, and shaking my head. There are plenty of \"jokes\" on a porno set, and there is much raucous mirth to dispel tension. But only a Chloe, only an exception, can inject humour. She sounded like Mel Brooks, in The Producers, saying, \"That's our Hitler!\" The kind of blowjob Chloe was telling me about yesterday was this kind of blowjob. It is as if the girl's passionate - indeed desperate - intention is to kiss the boy's lower abdomen. She faces an obstacle. She can't go around it. She has to go through it. \"I mean,\" Chloe had said admiringly, \"some of these girls go down. Drooling and slobbering, saliva everywhere, choking dry-heaving.\" It had to be said that the dry-heaving, from Artie's point of view, was visibly efficacious. When Lola was done, he gazed down with some complacence as Mister Monster went from three o'clock to half past 12. And that was the tenor of it: heat. That is where the market is taking us: toward heat, intensity, a frenzied athleticism. More than this, porno, it seems, is a parody of love. It therefore addresses itself to love's opposites, which are hate and death. \"Choke her!\" \"Spit inside me!\" \"Break me! You can't break me! Try!\" \"COMING!!!\" Chloe screamed this last word like a mother answering a child's cry from the other end of the house. Then, to Lola, \"Choke me!\" And Chloe's entire upper body flushed with pink, and she seemed to swoon . . . \"I wanna piss,\" said Artie, during one of his many intermissions. For a moment the DP's eyes widened in alarm. He thought, wrongly, that Artie wanted to piss on camera. \"Pissing is as bad as coming,\" he confided to me. \"They're supposed to piss and they can't. They go off to the shower, then they say they can piss and they can't.\" Artie trudged back from the can, worriedly nursing his condomed erection. \"God I'm old,\" he muttered, as he headed back to the fray. Well I'm old too, and I blew a kiss at Chloe and took my leave - before the anal and the popshot. Shannon drove me back to the hotel. Poor Shannon: she was having one of those days. First, shopping in a health-food store, she dropped a jar of wheatgerm on her foot and was now limping heavily. Then she discovered that her boyfriend was cheating on her - and she fired him. Contemplating the suspension of her love life, Shannon said sadly, \"And when you compare it to that, the sex doesn't seem much anyway.\" I knew what she meant, in a sense. Chloe-Artie-Lola made me feel like a virgin. Continued",

      "bodyText": "Rarely can the old war horse have been so worried. President Jacques Chirac has faced a close race or two in his career, but with the right four percentage points behind, tomorrow's local election run-off in Paris could mark the end of an era. While votes for the feuding and scandal-hit right have held up well in the provinces, the capital is a different matter, and its loss will deal a body-blow to the man who was its mayor for 18 years, and whose chosen successor, Jean Tiberi, has run it since 1995. The battle is not yet lost. Last Sunday's first-round gave the left - Socialists, Greens and Communists - a total of 43.6% and the rival conservative lists headed by Mr Tiberi and the official candidate of the right, Philippe Seguin, 39.6%. Whether Paris elects a its first leftwing council and mayor for 130 years depends on how middle-of-the road voters respond to this week's botched and ill-tempered attempt by the right to field a single list in each of the 20 arrondissements . Mr Tiberi is standing an an independent after being ditched by Mr Chirac's RPR because of sleaze allegations. But even though he has publicly insulted Mr Seguin as \"an irresponsible and lamentable man\", he has agreed to withdraw his lists in the 12th, 13th and 14th arrondissements, where a divided vote would be fatal to the right's chance of retaining power. The low-polling Mr Seguin, who refused Mr Tiberi's invitation to join forces and called his 40% vote in the 5th arrondissement \"a reward for dodgy dealings\", has withdrawn his lists in six others. In the 9th they have merged in a mood of ill-disguised mutual loathing. But that still leaves 10 districts where centre-right voters have a choice of rival conservative slates. And where there is a single list it is impossible to say, after so much mud-slinging, how many will vote for what hitherto a rival camp. \"Both Tiberi and Seguin are ridiculous,\" said Henri, a stu dent in the 5th. \"They are putting their own personal ambitions ahead of the interests of their party. We really do have the stupidest right in the world.\" Antoine, 44, a social worker in the 10th, said: \"It's absurd ... It's not good for anybody - not for the candidates, nor the voters, nor for Paris.\" Behind the scenes Mr Chirac has been trying to impose some show of unity on the RPR's warring factions, to keep control of the city hall he ran from 1977 to 1995 and which propelled him to the presidency. He knows that a win for the Socialist candidate, Bertrand Delanoe, could only be seen as an indictment of his already sleaze-tainted record as mayor, and could prove a big setback to his hope of retaining the presidency next year. In a last-ditch attempt to build bridges, Mr Tiberi and Mr Seguin reluctantly agreed yesterday to meet. But even if the right does somehow pull through, winning 82 of the 163 council seats needed to appoint the next mayor, Mr Chirac's problems will not necessarily be over. No one would put it past a vengeful Mr Tiberi to block Mr Seguin's appointment as mayor. If that happened the Gaullist RPR party, which Mr Chirac founded, would face the humiliating task of finding an acceptable second-string candidate - possibly the former prime minister Edouard Balladur or the former deputy mayor Fran\u00e7oise de Panafieu. Savouring the prospect of what the Paris right have taken to calling \"the election from hell\", Mr Delanoe said yesterday that it was too early to be sure of a historic Socialist win. \"But on one side you have a project, unity, a real team, a single candidate,\" he said. \"On the other sleaze, compromises, horse-trading, rivals. One side has shown respect for Paris. The other hasn't.\" As he nervously awaits the outcome of the vote that may determine his political future, even Mr Chirac would have to agree with that.

      "bodyText": "A Palestinian man was shot dead by Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip and at least 12 others were wounded as clashes erupted throughout the Palestinian territories yesterday. The man was named as Mohammed Abu Awn, 20, and said to have been shot in the chest while sitting near protesters hurling stones at troops guarding the road to the Jewish settlement of Netzarim. In the West Bank troops fired rubber bullets and teargas at hundreds of Palestinians throwing stones in protest at the Israeli encirclement of Ramallah. In Gaza city young children enacted a suicide bombing: a boy of 10 went on stage in a white shroud and climbed into a coffin-like box covered with an Israeli flag as another boy threw a firecracker to mimic the sound of an explosion. Palestinian groups had called a \"day of rage\" to maintain pressure on Israel to relax the restrictions imposed on the Palestinian people since the intifada began in September. Israel says it has begun to relax the clampdown, but Palestinian leaders say the changes are inadequate. The defence ministry said it would open both the Allenby bridge between the West Bank and Jordan and the Gaza-Egypt border during daylight hourts, and ease restrictions at Karni to allow raw materials in and out of the West Bank. A statement said the minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, \"expects that these steps will encourage the Palestinian economy and says that every drop in the level of violence will enable Israel to provide greater easings to the Palestinian population\". Late on Thursday Israel said it had arrested three members of the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's guard on suspicion of trying to explode a bomb near the West Bank military headquarters. Military sources said the three-man cell was involved in attacks in which eight Israelis were killed and 20 wounded. They include the December 31 ambush in the West Bank which killed the son and daughter-in-law of the late Meir Kahane, the rightwing extremist rabbi. The Israeli authorities have justified the closure of Ramallah as an attempt to foil attacks by the cell, said to be headed by the Ramallah commander of Force 17, an elite Palestinian security unit. The news of the arrests, and the suspects' close connection to the Palestinian Authority, was expected to back up the prime minister Ariel Sharon's decision not to renew peace talks with the Palestinians immediately. Meanwhile the spiritual leader of the militant Hamas group, Sheikh Yassin, has threatened to carry out big attacks on Israel. He predicted \"better, bigger and greater\" bomb attacks in the coming days. In recent months Hamas has stepped up its campaign against Israel and has been responsible for numerous attacks, including a recent bomb in a taxi and the Netanya bombing, which killed three Israelis. In the Palestinian-controlled city of Nablus, in the north of the West Bank, 2,500 people held a peaceful protest \"Lift the closure. Sharon lift the closure, this is the last time,\" they shouted. They said they planned more demonstrations on Saturday, and would march on the Israeli checkpoints on the outskirts of the city: an action likely to cause clashes with the Israeli soldiers posted there to enforce the closure. Brigadier-General Benny Gantz, the commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank, said in an interview published yesterday that the uprising was not conducted by ordinary people but organised from above. He told the newspaper Ma'ariv that he did not believe Yasser Arafat had made a major effort to halt the violence, in which at least 346 Palestinians, 13 Israeli Arabs and 65 other Israelis have been killed. The Palestinians want the UN to send an observer force to help quell the violence in the West Bank and Gaza. All the security council members support the call, except the US, but some western ambassadors say their support is conditional on Israel's approval.",

The plan to parcel off 67,000 hectares (170,000 acres) of forest reserve has united a normally split tribal society and brought environmentalists, farmers, journalists and opposition politicians together in horror and disbelief. Yesterday, the last day for public objections to the plan, the Centre for Human Rights and Democracy won a three-week stay in court in Eldoret, central Kenya, forcing a government rethink of the plan. The environment minister, Francis Nyenze, defended the project as an attempt to redefine forest boundaries in areas occupied by squatters and to prevent further encroachment. But aerial surveys by the Kenya Wildlife Service show that most of the forest is unsettled. Opponents claim the resultant deforestation would have a catastrophic effect on Kenya's water supply because of the finely balanced ecology. The vast majority of Kenya is either semi-arid or desert, and dependent on water from a few scattered catchments in the mountainous areas . About 15% of the Mau forest reserve in western Kenya is scheduled for clearance, despite its being the source of an estimated 40% of the country's water. Illegal logging to the east has already laid bare the source of the Njoro river, now dry for half the year. The government giveaway, timber and all, would represent a capital loss of an estimated \u00a31.7bn, even before the expected environmental costsare taken into account. \"It is very hard to see how the government can gain from the plan, unless there is a hidden agenda,\" said Michael Gachanja, coordinator of the Kenya Forest Working Group.

      "body": "<p>Below the wooded hill known as Arthuret Knowes is a county council sign about the Battle of Aedderyd (AD 573). On this spot, it says, the pagans of Strathclyde were slaughtered by the Christians of Cumbria. Though the pagan king Gwenddolau had Merlin to encourage him, 80,000 humans were killed. The number seems unimaginable.</p> <p>From the sign, you look across to Howend Farm, where the mass graves have been alight for the past week, sometimes blazing, sometimes smouldering. More than 5,000 pagan sheep and cattle belonging to farmer John Fisher (with just Nick Brown to encourage him) have been slaughtered by a marksman sent by the Christians at the Ministry of Agriculture.</p> <p>That is a tiny fraction of the animals killed in this small patch of Cumbria alone. The rest of the sheep will go in the next few days, the healthy as well as the sick: hundreds of thousands in all. The number seems unimaginable.</p> <p>Howend is just outside Longtown, the small town fringing the Scottish border that constitutes Ground Zero in the war against foot and mouth, a war which the disease has been winning. Longtown (pop 3,500; Lang-toon to the locals) used to have a mild local celebrity thanks to John Graham's amazing ironmongery. Most non-Cumbrians had never heard of the place - unless they were farmers.</p> <p>But Longtown also is - or was, three short weeks ago - a contender for Britain's biggest sheep market. Every Thursday up to 20,000 head of fatstock would be sold there. At this time of year, most would be hoggets: last year's hill lambs, reared on the lonely uplands of Scotland and Northumberland, destined to be killed and eaten further south. And it was here a month ago that an infected consignment arrived from Hexham and headed south, a process that silently and invisibly spread foot and mouth disease across much of Britain.</p> <p>On Thursday, the gates to the market were shut with a rusty padlock. The pens were deserted. The town itself was not much different. Only the bar of the Graham Arms (the name Graham is everywhere here) was full, and that was because of a funeral. Longtown - static, ageing, a little melancholy at the best of times - always puts a lot of emphasis on funerals.</p> <p>Longtown, however, is not just a prime source of the outbreak. It is also the very centre. Almost 10% of the farms affected nationally are in this vicinity. Up the A7 towards Canonbie on the Scottish side of the border, just about every farm is believed to be infected, and in the last few days the plague has been rippling out southwards towards Carlisle. Then on Thursday came the announcement that even healthy sheep would have to be \"culled\" within two miles of an outbreak. Everyone round Longtown is within two miles.</p> <p>Normally on a Thursday the rumours get passed round, and maybe leavened with a grain of truth, at the market cafe. This time, with the cafe shut, they just jumped from farm to farm like the disease itself. Since even Mr Brown originally thought all cattle would be slaughtered too, it was hardly surprising that the farmers were confused - and more contemptuous of London than ever. At one time, people were imagining that dogs and cats had to go.</p> <p>The big talk yesterday of rebellion and shotguns seemed almost as distant as Mr Brown's blandness. There is a stoic acceptance here that there are currently three sorts of farm animals: the dead, the sick and the soon to be one or the other.</p> <p>The handful of farmers who have so far held off the plague listened jumpily each time the phone rang yesterday. They know the grim reaper from Maff will lay his hands on their shoulders some time in the next few days.</p> <p>The Great Fire of Lang-toon has been alight all week. It is a little like the burning of the Kuwaiti oil wells in the Gulf war or an Australian bushfire. Nothing like it has been seen in the English countryside since stubble-burning was banned. Unless you have worked in a crematorium, there is no analogy for the smell. It is strange, unearthly: a mix of singed rubber and old socks. On Tuesday, the town stank terribly. On Wednesday, it hung in the fog all day.</p> <p>However, the split between farmers and their neighbours, so visible elsewhere in the countryside, is almost non-existent in Longtown. Directly or indirectly, almost everyone depends on sheep. A handful of Carlisle commuters have been attracted by the rock-bottom house prices, but only a handful. No one from the tourist trade has been shouting the odds about the damage done by farming, because there is no tourist trade worth mentioning except from visiting sheep dealers. South of here are the Lakes; north and west are Gretna and Galloway. But hardly anyone stops in Longtown unless they are tired, confused or heading for the mart. For generations, everything here has depended on sheep farming. Within a few days there will be no sheep.</p> <p>As Mr Brown made the announcement, I was with Bob Armstrong, the Longtown haulier who has been transporting animals to and from the mart since he took over his father's business in 1947. A third of his business was shut down overnight, and he has been left with 26 drivers who have nothing to do; the firm is desperately trying to avoid laying them off. He also runs a few hobby-sheep in the paddock behind his house. All perfectly healthy. \"They'll have to go now,\" he said phlegmatically as he digested the news. \"We had two little lambs born yesterday. Life can be cruel sometimes.\" The original announcement suggested that his milk tankers, another third of the business, would also have to go. He just shrugged that off too.</p> <p>Those worst affected are invisible. Every farm gate for miles around is blocked off by cones, tarpaulins, plastic netting, police tape, baler twine, anything that reinforces the Go Away message. Farmers with diseased animals lurk behind them, relying on friends to drop off supplies at the gate.</p> <p>John Fisher emerged briefly from his fortress at Howend and stood sentry in his flat cap and Barbour, without much purpose - but then, with no animals, he had nothing better to do. He seemed phlegmatic too, and even smiled wryly. \"If I look upbeat, I don't feel upbeat,\" he said. \"I've been having trouble sleeping.\"</p> <p>Mr Fisher may be one of the luckier ones: he kept up his foot and mouth insurance, which many others did not. Farmers keep using the same words as the TV reporters: \"devastating... terrible... heartbreaking... diabolical\".</p> <p>They are used to their animals being killed; they have become used to being sandbagged economically. It is not easy for them to disentangle their true feelings: how much distress is emotion; how much is about money. Some farmers will restock and start again; those with pedigree herds will lose bloodlines that go back generations. One sometimes suspects that those who show it least, like John Fisher, may actually feel it the most.</p> <p>No one in Longtown is immune, however. John Graham sits among his boxes of single screws, pull-on pipe nipples, oil lamp parts, and brass coffin nails, saying that business is worse than at any time in 30 years. He's convinced it will pass. \"People in a town like this have never expected a lot. North of Shap Fell, they can take bad times. What you've never had, you never miss.\" In Lang-toon the south means the softies sitting under palm trees in Preston and Blackburn.</p> <p>Everyone is taking the hit except, so it is said, Tommy Norman, who sells the railway sleepers that go at the bottom of the funeral trenches below the coal to get the fires going. The trouble is that sheep hardly burn, especially at this time of year when they are thick with wool. \"It's like putting a woollen jumper on a fire,\" explained Mr Fisher. \"It would nearly put it out. It's not like nylon.\" That's why the burning takes so long. What no one can adequately explain is why the carcasses are allowed to be left before the pyre is lit, leaving the crows time to peck at them and fly off to spread the disease.</p> <p>So the town shares the smoke, the pain, the grief and the grievances. But the grievances are unfocused. Is government policy too harsh or too weak? No one is certain, though they are instinctively convinced it must be one or the other. There seems no one in the area who can voice the farmers' feelings in a way that make them both coherent and audible. The town council offices had the blinds drawn and the door locked even during its opening hours. A French community of similar size would have an elected mayor.

      "bodyText": "Below the wooded hill known as Arthuret Knowes is a county council sign about the Battle of Aedderyd (AD 573). On this spot, it says, the pagans of Strathclyde were slaughtered by the Christians of Cumbria. Though the pagan king Gwenddolau had Merlin to encourage him, 80,000 humans were killed. The number seems unimaginable. From the sign, you look across to Howend Farm, where the mass graves have been alight for the past week, sometimes blazing, sometimes smouldering. More than 5,000 pagan sheep and cattle belonging to farmer John Fisher (with just Nick Brown to encourage him) have been slaughtered by a marksman sent by the Christians at the Ministry of Agriculture. That is a tiny fraction of the animals killed in this small patch of Cumbria alone. The rest of the sheep will go in the next few days, the healthy as well as the sick: hundreds of thousands in all. The number seems unimaginable. Howend is just outside Longtown, the small town fringing the Scottish border that constitutes Ground Zero in the war against foot and mouth, a war which the disease has been winning. Longtown (pop 3,500; Lang-toon to the locals) used to have a mild local celebrity thanks to John Graham's amazing ironmongery. Most non-Cumbrians had never heard of the place - unless they were farmers. But Longtown also is - or was, three short weeks ago - a contender for Britain's biggest sheep market. Every Thursday up to 20,000 head of fatstock would be sold there. At this time of year, most would be hoggets: last year's hill lambs, reared on the lonely uplands of Scotland and Northumberland, destined to be killed and eaten further south. And it was here a month ago that an infected consignment arrived from Hexham and headed south, a process that silently and invisibly spread foot and mouth disease across much of Britain. On Thursday, the gates to the market were shut with a rusty padlock. The pens were deserted. The town itself was not much different. Only the bar of the Graham Arms (the name Graham is everywhere here) was full, and that was because of a funeral. Longtown - static, ageing, a little melancholy at the best of times - always puts a lot of emphasis on funerals. Longtown, however, is not just a prime source of the outbreak. It is also the very centre. Almost 10% of the farms affected nationally are in this vicinity. Up the A7 towards Canonbie on the Scottish side of the border, just about every farm is believed to be infected, and in the last few days the plague has been rippling out southwards towards Carlisle. Then on Thursday came the announcement that even healthy sheep would have to be \"culled\" within two miles of an outbreak. Everyone round Longtown is within two miles. Normally on a Thursday the rumours get passed round, and maybe leavened with a grain of truth, at the market cafe. This time, with the cafe shut, they just jumped from farm to farm like the disease itself. Since even Mr Brown originally thought all cattle would be slaughtered too, it was hardly surprising that the farmers were confused - and more contemptuous of London than ever. At one time, people were imagining that dogs and cats had to go. The big talk yesterday of rebellion and shotguns seemed almost as distant as Mr Brown's blandness. There is a stoic acceptance here that there are currently three sorts of farm animals: the dead, the sick and the soon to be one or the other. The handful of farmers who have so far held off the plague listened jumpily each time the phone rang yesterday. They know the grim reaper from Maff will lay his hands on their shoulders some time in the next few days. The Great Fire of Lang-toon has been alight all week. It is a little like the burning of the Kuwaiti oil wells in the Gulf war or an Australian bushfire. Nothing like it has been seen in the English countryside since stubble-burning was banned. Unless you have worked in a crematorium, there is no analogy for the smell. It is strange, unearthly: a mix of singed rubber and old socks. On Tuesday, the town stank terribly. On Wednesday, it hung in the fog all day. However, the split between farmers and their neighbours, so visible elsewhere in the countryside, is almost non-existent in Longtown. Directly or indirectly, almost everyone depends on sheep. A handful of Carlisle commuters have been attracted by the rock-bottom house prices, but only a handful. No one from the tourist trade has been shouting the odds about the damage done by farming, because there is no tourist trade worth mentioning except from visiting sheep dealers. South of here are the Lakes; north and west are Gretna and Galloway. But hardly anyone stops in Longtown unless they are tired, confused or heading for the mart. For generations, everything here has depended on sheep farming. Within a few days there will be no sheep. As Mr Brown made the announcement, I was with Bob Armstrong, the Longtown haulier who has been transporting animals to and from the mart since he took over his father's business in 1947. A third of his business was shut down overnight, and he has been left with 26 drivers who have nothing to do; the firm is desperately trying to avoid laying them off. He also runs a few hobby-sheep in the paddock behind his house. All perfectly healthy. \"They'll have to go now,\" he said phlegmatically as he digested the news. \"We had two little lambs born yesterday. Life can be cruel sometimes.\" The original announcement suggested that his milk tankers, another third of the business, would also have to go. He just shrugged that off too. Those worst affected are invisible. Every farm gate for miles around is blocked off by cones, tarpaulins, plastic netting, police tape, baler twine, anything that reinforces the Go Away message. Farmers with diseased animals lurk behind them, relying on friends to drop off supplies at the gate. John Fisher emerged briefly from his fortress at Howend and stood sentry in his flat cap and Barbour, without much purpose - but then, with no animals, he had nothing better to do. He seemed phlegmatic too, and even smiled wryly. \"If I look upbeat, I don't feel upbeat,\" he said. \"I've been having trouble sleeping.\" Mr Fisher may be one of the luckier ones: he kept up his foot and mouth insurance, which many others did not. Farmers keep using the same words as the TV reporters: \"devastating... terrible... heartbreaking... diabolical\". They are used to their animals being killed; they have become used to being sandbagged economically. It is not easy for them to disentangle their true feelings: how much distress is emotion; how much is about money. Some farmers will restock and start again; those with pedigree herds will lose bloodlines that go back generations. One sometimes suspects that those who show it least, like John Fisher, may actually feel it the most. No one in Longtown is immune, however. John Graham sits among his boxes of single screws, pull-on pipe nipples, oil lamp parts, and brass coffin nails, saying that business is worse than at any time in 30 years. He's convinced it will pass. \"People in a town like this have never expected a lot. North of Shap Fell, they can take bad times. What you've never had, you never miss.\" In Lang-toon the south means the softies sitting under palm trees in Preston and Blackburn. Everyone is taking the hit except, so it is said, Tommy Norman, who sells the railway sleepers that go at the bottom of the funeral trenches below the coal to get the fires going. The trouble is that sheep hardly burn, especially at this time of year when they are thick with wool. \"It's like putting a woollen jumper on a fire,\" explained Mr Fisher. \"It would nearly put it out. It's not like nylon.\" That's why the burning takes so long. What no one can adequately explain is why the carcasses are allowed to be left before the pyre is lit, leaving the crows time to peck at them and fly off to spread the disease. So the town shares the smoke, the pain, the grief and the grievances. But the grievances are unfocused. Is government policy too harsh or too weak? No one is certain, though they are instinctively convinced it must be one or the other. There seems no one in the area who can voice the farmers' feelings in a way that make them both coherent and audible. The town council offices had the blinds drawn and the door locked even during its opening hours. A French community of similar size would have an elected mayor. In Longtown, there is not even a vicar. In the absence of an incumbent, the Rev John Smith, formerly Cumbria's chief librarian and now an unpaid curate, does his best, though he lives 10 miles away. Tomorrow, there will be a special session before the normal Sunday church service. They will pray by name for each of the farmers affected and ring the bell like the Angelus. The church looks over to Howend too and if the wind is wrong, the congregation might catch the smoke. As night falls, there are patches of what seems like thick fog on the A7. But this is no fog: it's smoke. The fires lit the night, as if it were Guy Fawkes or a jubilee. There is no laughter round these fires, however. Nor will there be, for some time. What's going on?

      "body": "<p>Farmers told to slaughter livestock not infected with foot and mouth have been called upon to stand in front of the slaughterman's gun to stop the \"unnecessary killing\" of their animals.</p> <p>Members of Farmers for Action, the group that began last year's fuel protests, have warned that there will be a \"revolt in the countryside\" if the government goes ahead with plans for a mass cull.</p> <p>David Handley, the chairman of FFA, said yesterday that farmers would not allow the wholesale slaughter of their animals if they believed they were not infected. A fellow FFA member, Andrew Spence, who is a mile and a half away from one of the outbreaks in Cumbria, threatened to barricade himself into his farm if anyone came to kill his sheep.</p> <p>Mr Handley said: \"Farmers are saying enough is enough. They are not going to sit down and allow perfectly healthy animals which have gone through a period of quarantine to be slaughtered.</p> <p>\"There's no justification in killing them. We will go out and prevent that from happening. We will stand in front of them to stop them being shot. There's no scientific evidence to show this is justified. If they show us scientific evidence which justifies it then we will allow them to do it.\"</p> <p>However, the government was yesterday trying to explain that animals with the virus do not always display symptoms, and can carry the disease and pass it on to other stock without farmers being aware of it. FFA demanded that farmers be shown \"scientific proof\".</p> <p>As tension in the countryside mounted yesterday, a farmer in Penrith, Cumbria, had his firearms confiscated after he allegedly made a telephone threat to foot and mouth officials who had contacted him about culling his \"healthy livestock\".</p> <p>Cumbria police said: \"During the current foot and mouth outbreak police are aware of the potential of people to make threats with firearms against anyone who may come on to their land. While understanding the distress which provokes such a response, police cannot accept a threat to life and will remove the firearms of anyone who makes such threats. We went to see the family and the farmer handed over the shotgun voluntarily. He was understandably very upset.\"</p> <p>Condemning the use of any firearms, Mr Handley, who coordinated last year's fuel protests from his farm in south Wales, went on to warn that there would be some sort of revolt if similar cases of slaughter continued. \"We have done it before and we will do it again,\" he said.</p> <p>\"This is a nightmare scenario. You wake up every morning and the first thing you have got to do is march the cattle up a piece of concrete to see if they are lame. It really is gut-wrenching but so far they are not infected. We have got this far and we will stand in front of the uninfected animals that they intend to shoot. We have got people's livelihoods at stake here.\"</p> <p>Mr Spence said: \"If I back onto an exclusion zone and they said they were coming to slaughter my animals, I would try to stop them gaining access to my farm. I would shove a tractor across my gate. I am standing with my sheep now and if they had foot and mouth I would walk into the slaughterhouse with them now. But for the slaughter of them for no reason other than they are in a restricted area, I won't let that happen.</p> <p>\"I have run this farm since I was 14 and you can't expect me just to give it up. If they get it they will be slaughtered and that's me on the dole, that's an inevitable fact of foot and mouth. We are farmers, we are not butchers or slaughterers.\"</p> <p>The FFA has advised farmers to contact their local coordinator if they want help stopping their livestock from being killed. Mr Handley said: \"Basically what we are saying is if you don't want this to happen and you are not satisfied with the scientific evidence given to you and you don't want your animals slaughtered, contact your local FFA coordinator. We will help you.</p> <p>\"If you want someone to come and assist you stopping them from killing your animals we will help. I am not talking about thousands of farmers travelling from one side of the country to another. But people can go to the drive end of the farm.\"</p> <p>Mr Handley said the group was \"playing things by ear\" and considering options, one of which was some kind of \"tarmac protest\".</p> <p>He said farmers were demanding that the army should be brought in to clear up the backlog of dead animals and that the government should ban meat imports until the crisis is over.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

      "bodyText": "Farmers told to slaughter livestock not infected with foot and mouth have been called upon to stand in front of the slaughterman's gun to stop the \"unnecessary killing\" of their animals. Members of Farmers for Action, the group that began last year's fuel protests, have warned that there will be a \"revolt in the countryside\" if the government goes ahead with plans for a mass cull. David Handley, the chairman of FFA, said yesterday that farmers would not allow the wholesale slaughter of their animals if they believed they were not infected. A fellow FFA member, Andrew Spence, who is a mile and a half away from one of the outbreaks in Cumbria, threatened to barricade himself into his farm if anyone came to kill his sheep. Mr Handley said: \"Farmers are saying enough is enough. They are not going to sit down and allow perfectly healthy animals which have gone through a period of quarantine to be slaughtered. \"There's no justification in killing them. We will go out and prevent that from happening. We will stand in front of them to stop them being shot. There's no scientific evidence to show this is justified. If they show us scientific evidence which justifies it then we will allow them to do it.\" However, the government was yesterday trying to explain that animals with the virus do not always display symptoms, and can carry the disease and pass it on to other stock without farmers being aware of it. FFA demanded that farmers be shown \"scientific proof\". As tension in the countryside mounted yesterday, a farmer in Penrith, Cumbria, had his firearms confiscated after he allegedly made a telephone threat to foot and mouth officials who had contacted him about culling his \"healthy livestock\". Cumbria police said: \"During the current foot and mouth outbreak police are aware of the potential of people to make threats with firearms against anyone who may come on to their land. While understanding the distress which provokes such a response, police cannot accept a threat to life and will remove the firearms of anyone who makes such threats. We went to see the family and the farmer handed over the shotgun voluntarily. He was understandably very upset.\" Condemning the use of any firearms, Mr Handley, who coordinated last year's fuel protests from his farm in south Wales, went on to warn that there would be some sort of revolt if similar cases of slaughter continued. \"We have done it before and we will do it again,\" he said. \"This is a nightmare scenario. You wake up every morning and the first thing you have got to do is march the cattle up a piece of concrete to see if they are lame. It really is gut-wrenching but so far they are not infected. We have got this far and we will stand in front of the uninfected animals that they intend to shoot. We have got people's livelihoods at stake here.\" Mr Spence said: \"If I back onto an exclusion zone and they said they were coming to slaughter my animals, I would try to stop them gaining access to my farm. I would shove a tractor across my gate. I am standing with my sheep now and if they had foot and mouth I would walk into the slaughterhouse with them now. But for the slaughter of them for no reason other than they are in a restricted area, I won't let that happen. \"I have run this farm since I was 14 and you can't expect me just to give it up. If they get it they will be slaughtered and that's me on the dole, that's an inevitable fact of foot and mouth. We are farmers, we are not butchers or slaughterers.\" The FFA has advised farmers to contact their local coordinator if they want help stopping their livestock from being killed. Mr Handley said: \"Basically what we are saying is if you don't want this to happen and you are not satisfied with the scientific evidence given to you and you don't want your animals slaughtered, contact your local FFA coordinator. We will help you. \"If you want someone to come and assist you stopping them from killing your animals we will help. I am not talking about thousands of farmers travelling from one side of the country to another. But people can go to the drive end of the farm.\" Mr Handley said the group was \"playing things by ear\" and considering options, one of which was some kind of \"tarmac protest\". He said farmers were demanding that the army should be brought in to clear up the backlog of dead animals and that the government should ban meat imports until the crisis is over. What's going on?

      "body": "<p>First things first. Force yourself out of your back door and take a long, hard look at what you see. Stop deluding yourself: your garden is in need of serious surgery. Clear the smokescreen that says it's \"mature\", \"natural-looking\" or \"filled with unkempt charm\". Deep down, you know your plants have grown into a semi-solid, lumpy kind of hybrid that you forgivingly describe as a border. The lawn (if you can call it that) has probably sprouted dandelions and moss over its once-clean surface, and anything that's not perpetually green is now a tangled mass of bunged-together dead growth.</p> <p>If you're ever going to enjoy a summer barbecue, chinking beers with friends in that twinkling oasis of calm, then you're going to have to take serious action. And you need do it now before it's too late. Too much time considering how you're going to perform that facelift, and your garden will have taken the law into its own hands. Come June, you won't be able to see the plants for the weeds, climbers will have spiralled out of control - becoming a twisted mass of ugly, naked stems with any flowers hanging precariously high up - and shrubs will have developed into veritable monsters; blocking out light and snarling over everything. If you decide to attack them with the loppers, they'll probably curl up and die just to spite you. Now who wants that amount of gardening grief?</p> <p>Incidentally, if you're thinking of using the \"I don't know where to start\" routine, then forget it. The first step in organising your garden is organising yourself. So here is a list of what to do: get yourself into gear now and get outside.</p> <p><b>Fully tooled-up</b><br></p> <p>Did you really think you were going to get through spring with only the contents of your cutlery drawer to aid your horticultural endeavours? Scissors are not effective at cutting lawns and serving spoons will never replace the trowel. If you can get at your shed, prise open the door, clear the cobwebs and look inside. If anything remotely garden-ish is in there, pull it out and give it a shake. Any tool that has started to rust is best re-housed in the dustbin. Dirty equipment is the fastest way to spread disease, and eventually death, in your borders. If your gardening ventures in the past have been few and far between, then you'll probably need to invest in some tools. Get to the garden centre (avoiding the rows of gorgeous looking plants for now) and head for the tool section. I'm not suggesting you need to buy one of everything, but you will at least need the basics.</p> <p>The first absolute necessity is a fork. Far more useful than a spade, you can use it to dig, weed, split up plants and shift things. Try out as many as you can before you buy one, to see which suits you best. If you can stretch to the pricier, stainless-steel models, then do - stainless steel cuts through soil better than anything else, taking some of the work out of a tiring job. And think about the handle, too. Wood is soft and kind to hands, not cold like metal or harsh like plastic (which always seems to cut my hands).</p> <p>Next, pick up some secateurs. They come in lots of different shapes, weights and sizes, and with two different types of blade - anvil and scissor. Go for scissor blades and keep them sharp. Anvil blades tend to crush plant stems, which can lead to infections. A good-quality (and very sharp) set of scissor blades, on the other hand, glides effortlessly through most pruning jobs, making clean cuts which encourage good growth. Buy a hoe, a watering can and a trowel, too. They can be as cheap as you like: in my opinion, one is much like another.</p> <p>Eventually, you'll probably also need a rake, a wheelbarrow, some loppers and plenty more things, but as you'll never need to use all of them at at once, why not add to the basics as the need arises? Once home, store your shiny new possessions in a dry place, out of direct sunlight, and look after them.</p> <p><b>Pruning</b><br></p> <p>There is something intensely satisfying in cutting away at a plant, especially if it's dead, damaged or diseased. Now is the perfect time to wield your power over the shrubs, climbers and perennials languishing in your garden. But only prune for a reason: some plants will never need it and, once in, they'll grow quite happily without assistance from you. Let yourself loose on buddleia, mallow (lavatera), dogwoods (cornus), herbaceous perennials (plants that come up each year) that look dead and overgrown, hazels (corylus) and smoke trees (cotinus). All will benefit from cutting back to the ground. Go easy on fuchsia, hardy plumbago (ceratostigma), caryopteris, spiraea, hibiscus and hydrangea; you don't want to loose their shape. Lavenders should have old flowerheads and some of the stem clipped to keep them nicely hummocked. Clematis that need hard pruning are all the late summer and autumn flowerers. These include the jackmaniis, C. tangutica , C. rehderiana and C. viticella . If you've got an out-of- control C. montana , then it's safe to kerb it after it has flowered, which will be soon. Summer flowering jasmine can be rejuvenated by taking out a third of old growth every spring, while passion flowers can be cut to 1m above ground level every five years. If you're unsure, remember the old saying, \"If it flowers before June, do not prune.\" This way, you won't butcher your garden into submission.</p> <p><b>War on weeds</b><br></p> <p>From now on, weeds are the enemy. They steal into your borders, pinching nutrients, light, water and space, eventually killing the plants you want to thrive. Dig them up (including the roots) before they flower, get rid of them and prevent them returning with the use of mulches (or weed-proof membranes), available from garden centres (better still, make your own mulch in a compost heap). Now that you can actually see the soil, dig it over, incorporating as much compost as you can lay your hands on. Compost will open up the soil, making it easier for roots to get down into it, ultimately leading to bigger, healthier plants. Sprinkle some general-purpose fertiliser around (fish, blood and bone is ideal); this will save you time later when you're planting. When digging over, bank the beds away from any lawn, then use your fork to level out the area.</p> <p><b> Lawn again</b><br></p> <p>If your lawn is starting to look a bit shaggy, raise the blades on your mower and cut it. Lawns hate being scalped at this time of the year. If you'd actually prefer to spend your time at the garden centre, then just trim the edges - it's amazing what a difference it will make.</p> <p><b> Garden centre savvy</b><br></p> <p>I have always thought that opening the door to a garden centre is a bit like opening Pandora's box. Enticed by the glamour of all those supermodel plants, people grab the most beautiful then ram then in the borders back home with no regard to eventual height and spread, main-tenance, sun or shade requirements, or soil type. Before you even step out of your front door, think about the plants your garden needs. Grab a book (Royal Horticultural Society plant encyclopaedias are ideal), see which plants you like (making sure they'll actually grow where you plan to put them), then write a list. And stick to it.</p> <p><b>The way forward</b><br></p> <p>That's it. The backbreaking work is over. Now you can take pleasure in watching your garden grow.

      "bodyText": "First things first. Force yourself out of your back door and take a long, hard look at what you see. Stop deluding yourself: your garden is in need of serious surgery. Clear the smokescreen that says it's \"mature\", \"natural-looking\" or \"filled with unkempt charm\". Deep down, you know your plants have grown into a semi-solid, lumpy kind of hybrid that you forgivingly describe as a border. The lawn (if you can call it that) has probably sprouted dandelions and moss over its once-clean surface, and anything that's not perpetually green is now a tangled mass of bunged-together dead growth. If you're ever going to enjoy a summer barbecue, chinking beers with friends in that twinkling oasis of calm, then you're going to have to take serious action. And you need do it now before it's too late. Too much time considering how you're going to perform that facelift, and your garden will have taken the law into its own hands. Come June, you won't be able to see the plants for the weeds, climbers will have spiralled out of control - becoming a twisted mass of ugly, naked stems with any flowers hanging precariously high up - and shrubs will have developed into veritable monsters; blocking out light and snarling over everything. If you decide to attack them with the loppers, they'll probably curl up and die just to spite you. Now who wants that amount of gardening grief? Incidentally, if you're thinking of using the \"I don't know where to start\" routine, then forget it. The first step in organising your garden is organising yourself. So here is a list of what to do: get yourself into gear now and get outside. Fully tooled-up Did you really think you were going to get through spring with only the contents of your cutlery drawer to aid your horticultural endeavours? Scissors are not effective at cutting lawns and serving spoons will never replace the trowel. If you can get at your shed, prise open the door, clear the cobwebs and look inside. If anything remotely garden-ish is in there, pull it out and give it a shake. Any tool that has started to rust is best re-housed in the dustbin. Dirty equipment is the fastest way to spread disease, and eventually death, in your borders. If your gardening ventures in the past have been few and far between, then you'll probably need to invest in some tools. Get to the garden centre (avoiding the rows of gorgeous looking plants for now) and head for the tool section. I'm not suggesting you need to buy one of everything, but you will at least need the basics. The first absolute necessity is a fork.

A Club England roadshow will also tour the country in an attempt to recruit more ethnic-minority England fans. The EMC, which organises travel to matches at home and abroad, has been accused of being dominated by white males, many of them racist.

The report concedes: \"It will not be easy to attract a more diverse following, particularly when England matches are shrouded in an atmosphere of xenophobia and violence.\" One aim of Club England will be to make \"supporting the national side a more attractive option to those sections of society currently under-represented, families, women and minority ethnic communities. \"It is unacceptable for any section of the community to feel excluded.\" All 30,000 members of the existing EMC will be asked to reapply to join Club England.

      "bodyText": "After the wobbly bridge and the Dome fiasco, a millennium success story. The Eden Project, three huge domes of horticultural diversity housed in a disused clay pit, opens today on time and to near universal approval. The \u00a386m project, part-funded by the Millennium commission, was conceived by horticulturalist and former TV executive Tim Smit. The greenhouse, in St Austell, Cornwall, will house 12,000 plant species from all five continents in three \"biomes\" with artificial climates. The largest biome, 55 metres tall and 100 metres wide, reproduces the 65% humidity and temperatures of the tropics and features plants from west Africa and south America. Philip McMillan Browse, horticultural director, said: \"This is not a garden. We are creating a museum and the plants are a series of exhibits.\" It is hoped that the project will boost Cornwall's economy with 750,000 visitors expected annually. Around 500,000 people have already been to watch the huge domes being built.",

Great Aunt losing touch with reality, Harriet asleep all day and awake all night adorned with white make-up and hoping Hannibal Lecter will come down the chimney like a kind of carnivorous Santa. She got into the film easily, even though officially too young. It's people like me, over 50 and of a Nervous Disposition, who should be refused entry. \"Did you recognise any places in Florence that we visited two years ago?\" I enquire with a pitiful instinct to turn a depraved, atavistic eroticism into an educational experience. \"Uh, yeah, that street . . .\" grunts Harriet. Phew! That's all right, then. Trapped by crabbed age and youth, but most of all by Elaine and her child. For nearly three months she has been here, a refugee from her flooded and subsiding house. Will I never get rid of her? Why doesn't Gordon do the decent thing and elope with her all over again? I'm trapped with him, too. I seem to be running a day-care centre for obscure figures from my past. Any minute now I shall be making cups of tea for my own placenta.

Just one word of Knowledgerian warning: don't expect your potion to have the creamy stability of what squirts from the Heinz bottle. Salad cream is an emulsion. Emulsions, like your favourite teacup, have a tendency to break. (Why do you think Heinz uses stabilisers?) But better a grainy texture than a mouthful of xanthan gum. The Knowledge does acknowledge that some people retain a nostalgic fondness for the bottled stuff, even if he's not one of them. He eats it when it's served - for reasons investigated but undiscovered - with fried seafood dishes in certain Chinese restaurants. Homemade: for cold meat, poultry and fishy dishies. Salad - in the leafy sense of the word - is the worst place to splash it.

Just one word of Knowledgerian warning: don't expect your potion to have the creamy stability of what squirts from the Heinz bottle. Salad cream is an emulsion. Emulsions, like your favourite teacup, have a tendency to break. (Why do you think Heinz uses stabilisers?) But better a grainy texture than a mouthful of xanthan gum. The Knowledge does acknowledge that some people retain a nostalgic fondness for the bottled stuff, even if he's not one of them. He eats it when it's served - for reasons investigated but undiscovered - with fried seafood dishes in certain Chinese restaurants. Homemade: for cold meat, poultry and fishy dishies. Salad - in the leafy sense of the word - is the worst place to splash it. The high gloop-factor sits as successfully on a leaf of cos as an elephant sits on a soap bubble. The easy way out: Cream Meanz Heinz. Where to buy: Eh?",

Let us get the latter horror out of the way first. Somerfield's (and Kwik Save's) Vin de Pays des Coteaux de l'Ardeche Rouge 1999 is dry with a hint of rustic sod, and goes well with spicy food. It rates 14.5 points, and can be yours for the princely sum of \u00a32.49 until April 3. At the other end of the scale, and over at Majestic, there is Wynns Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon 1997 at \u00a39.99. Majestic demands nigh on a tenner from you to take off with a single bottle of this wine, but, of course, you can claim this single bottle only as part of a mixed case or a whole case. This wine offers a stunning level of classy elegance, with real live tannins that permits the lovely rich 17-point fruit to be textured, beautifully gripping and lingering.</p> <p>If this is insufficiently outrageous for you, then Oddbins offers several alternatives. Elderton Barossa Shiraz 1997 (17 points, \u00a312.99), from Australia, parades immensely dark fruit and depth with balsamic-textured hedgerow fruitiness and a great flourish on the finish. It is a brilliant example of truly sensual shiraz. Not to be outdone, Italy offers its own style of sensual fruitiness with Inferi Marramiero Montepulciano d'Abruzzo 1996 (17 points, \u00a310.49), which has a jammy intensity allied to a delicious, food-friendly earthiness. You can, however, spend less at Oddbins and get more. Ch\u00e2teau de Nages Cuv\u00e9e Joseph Torres Costi\u00e8res de Nimes 1997 (17.5 points, \u00a36.99) is a complex, delicate yet rich and highly polished red wine offering a luxurious experience at what is, for certain drinkers, almost a vulgar plonk price. For them, Colom\u00e9 Cabernet Malbec 1998 (17 points, \u00a315.99), from Argentina, is comfortingly expensive and svelte. It is remarkably complex and deep; a wine that evolves at length on the tongue to reveal figs, tobacco, blackberries and spice, and then simply hangs on in there. To finish a meal at which such a gorgeous wine is served with the main course, there is the sybaritically honied Dindarello Maculan Veneto 1999 (17.5 points, in the half bottle for \u00a36.99), which has an intense sweetness that reveals layers of pineapple, candied ginger and br\u00fbl\u00e9ed strawberries. It is a dessert wine to sip in awe or, indeed, in Ayr (where Oddbins has a branch).</p> <p>These hedonistic and, it must be said, expensive treats are countered, this week, by Safeway, which has five interesting wines all for less than a fiver. Chilean Sauvignon Blanc 2000 (16 points, \u00a33.99) is an own-label bottling, which is crisper and more compelling than many a Sancerre. Ch\u00e2teau de Lausi\u00e8res Coteaux du Languedoc 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.75) is herby, earthy and characterful, a meaty mouthful, with a wonderful rush of tannins on the finish. It is, though, in what is characterised as 'limited distribution', which means that not every Safeway branch can flog it to you (call 01622 712926 for details). Cruz de Piedra Garnacha 1999 (15 points, \u00a33.99), from Spain, has more support among branches of Safeway. It has an unusual richness and a bramble-fruited style not entirely typical of this red grape, which is, of course, grenache. The own-label Argentinian Syrah 2000 (15 points, \u00a33.99) is rich, deep, fleshy and with an odd spicy lilt that gives it a distinctiveness marking it out from the Australian version of this Rh\u00f4ne-originating syrah grape. It is a deliciously softly textured wine. Trulli Chardonnay 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.49), from Apulia, Italy, is a marvellously fluent wine, dry, crisp, complex and elegant. This is also in short supply, but if your local Safeway hasn't got it, try Somerfield.</p> <p>For the latest wine news, or to email Malcolm Gluck, visit superplonk.com</p>",

      "body": "<p>If Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen had collaborated on an interior with Albert Einstein, chances are the result would be something like the home of Charles Jencks. Here, in elegant Kensington, London, swagged curtains hang across windows into parallel universes and extravagant joinery conceals keys to the cosmos. It hits you even in the tiny lobby, where a frieze portrays thinkers through history, while above your head in a \"Cosmic Oval\" sculpture and beneath your feet are concentric patterns representing our solar system. Everything is loaded with meaning.<br><br>Jencks is the critic loved or loathed by architects the world over as the high priest of postmodernism. It was Jencks who first made sense of the chaos of classical and popular references that erupted in the architecture of the 80s, and that now is all around us in pedimented office blocks and Sainsbury's stores with Egyptian-style columns. Jencks's 1977 book, The Language Of Post-Modern Architecture, ran to six editions until 1991, roughly spanning the period when such architecture was popular.<br><br> Jencks's house is his book in built form. It is a riotous clutter of clashing symbols, a monument, he says, for the education of postmodernist architects. So many of them, in Jencks's austere mind, fell short of the mark. The most famous of them is the American Michael Graves, best known in Britain for his conical whistling-bird kettle for Alessi. But, in Jencks's opinion, he was lost forever when he became court architect to the Disney Corporation. His latest achievement here is to create a loo brush for Marks &amp; Spencer. <br><br> When it comes to another postmodernist leading light, Robert Venturi, architect of the National Gallery extension, Jencks says his ideas about symbolism are wrong. Venturi's most (in)famous example was an old people's home in Philadelphia with a giant TV aerial - \"a symbol of the aged, who spend so much time looking at TV,\" according to the architect. For Jencks, though, it fell short of the ambiguity of a symbol: it was simply a crude \"sign\" with only one interpretation.<br><br> For a man so demanding, Jencks's house is full of architectural and decorative witticisms. The back of the house, he says, can be \"read\" as a family portrait of Jencks, his late wife and their two children, with the windows making the faces. The place is overloaded with objects and designs that clamour to be decoded. A large, blocky fireplace by Graves is Egyptian-inspired; the kitchen is Mogul. It is overdesigned, he cheerfully admits. \"I wouldn't have done it like this, except to criticise Venturi.\"<br><br> More than 20 years after its genesis, he has not tired of giving tours of the so-called Thematic House. When I arrive early for our interview, he is showing round a group of visiting cosmologists. I am left sitting in a circle of sofas in the Spring Room, one of four inter-connecting rooms on the ground floor, themed for the seasons. There is much to look at -not just the antiques and shelves of art books, but geological specimens and sculptures by members of his family. The small standard lamps that illuminate the area, I notice, are supported on . . . a spring.<br><br> There are equally painful puns scattered round the house. The den where Jencks writes his architectural manifestos is lined with shelf units, each one shaped like a building of the period it houses. Except that fashions change, and the medieval section now accommodates an explosion of books on Japanese architecture. <br><br> Some ideas may not have aged well in the 20 years since he rebuilt this 1840s house with the help of Terry Farrell Architects. Some of the edges are by now scuffed, revealing the plywood beneath the painted stonework effect. But this wear makes the house strangely liveable. It may be a three-dimensional lesson in architecture and symbolism, but it is also comfortable. If you think it might be tiresome to live amid this jostle of intellectual foppery, just remember your own Victorian moulded ceilings whose details have their own forgotten symbolic meaning. The presence of so much history makes modern, everyday things look like an intrusion in Jencks's home. A computer room is discreetly tucked away for this reason. If there are the usual appliances in the kitchen, they lurk behind extravagantly detailed facades in their sunset colours. \"To design a symbolic house in an agnostic age may seem to be a folly,\" Jencks once wrote about the house. \"What is there to symbolise?\" Typically, he provides his own answer: cosmology.

      "bodyText": "If Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen had collaborated on an interior with Albert Einstein, chances are the result would be something like the home of Charles Jencks. Here, in elegant Kensington, London, swagged curtains hang across windows into parallel universes and extravagant joinery conceals keys to the cosmos. It hits you even in the tiny lobby, where a frieze portrays thinkers through history, while above your head in a \"Cosmic Oval\" sculpture and beneath your feet are concentric patterns representing our solar system. Everything is loaded with meaning. Jencks is the critic loved or loathed by architects the world over as the high priest of postmodernism. It was Jencks who first made sense of the chaos of classical and popular references that erupted in the architecture of the 80s, and that now is all around us in pedimented office blocks and Sainsbury's stores with Egyptian-style columns. Jencks's 1977 book, The Language Of Post-Modern Architecture, ran to six editions until 1991, roughly spanning the period when such architecture was popular. Jencks's house is his book in built form. It is a riotous clutter of clashing symbols, a monument, he says, for the education of postmodernist architects. So many of them, in Jencks's austere mind, fell short of the mark. The most famous of them is the American Michael Graves, best known in Britain for his conical whistling-bird kettle for Alessi. But, in Jencks's opinion, he was lost forever when he became court architect to the Disney Corporation. His latest achievement here is to create a loo brush for Marks &amp; Spencer. When it comes to another postmodernist leading light, Robert Venturi, architect of the National Gallery extension, Jencks says his ideas about symbolism are wrong. Venturi's most (in)famous example was an old people's home in Philadelphia with a giant TV aerial - \"a symbol of the aged, who spend so much time looking at TV,\" according to the architect. For Jencks, though, it fell short of the ambiguity of a symbol: it was simply a crude \"sign\" with only one interpretation. For a man so demanding, Jencks's house is full of architectural and decorative witticisms. The back of the house, he says, can be \"read\" as a family portrait of Jencks, his late wife and their two children, with the windows making the faces. The place is overloaded with objects and designs that clamour to be decoded. A large, blocky fireplace by Graves is Egyptian-inspired; the kitchen is Mogul. It is overdesigned, he cheerfully admits. \"I wouldn't have done it like this, except to criticise Venturi.\" More than 20 years after its genesis, he has not tired of giving tours of the so-called Thematic House. When I arrive early for our interview, he is showing round a group of visiting cosmologists. I am left sitting in a circle of sofas in the Spring Room, one of four inter-connecting rooms on the ground floor, themed for the seasons. There is much to look at -not just the antiques and shelves of art books, but geological specimens and sculptures by members of his family. The small standard lamps that illuminate the area, I notice, are supported on . . . a spring. There are equally painful puns scattered round the house. The den where Jencks writes his architectural manifestos is lined with shelf units, each one shaped like a building of the period it houses. Except that fashions change, and the medieval section now accommodates an explosion of books on Japanese architecture. Some ideas may not have aged well in the 20 years since he rebuilt this 1840s house with the help of Terry Farrell Architects. Some of the edges are by now scuffed, revealing the plywood beneath the painted stonework effect. But this wear makes the house strangely liveable. It may be a three-dimensional lesson in architecture and symbolism, but it is also comfortable. If you think it might be tiresome to live amid this jostle of intellectual foppery, just remember your own Victorian moulded ceilings whose details have their own forgotten symbolic meaning. The presence of so much history makes modern, everyday things look like an intrusion in Jencks's home. A computer room is discreetly tucked away for this reason. If there are the usual appliances in the kitchen, they lurk behind extravagantly detailed facades in their sunset colours. \"To design a symbolic house in an agnostic age may seem to be a folly,\" Jencks once wrote about the house. \"What is there to symbolise?\" Typically, he provides his own answer: cosmology. This is Jencks's grand new theme after postmodernism. The kitchen table has the orbits of the planets notched into it. A central feature is the spiral Solar Stair, providing a vertical ascent from darkness - there is a \"black hole\" mosaic in the basement floor - into light. This journey is one of the oldest ideas in architecture, but updated for our uncertain, godless age. There are 52 steps, one for each week of the year, and seven layers to each step. The spiral itself purports to symbolise our spiral galaxy, even if a stair is not strictly a spiral but a helix. But why let that spoil a nice game of symbolism?

To the infant Sage, the future academic and literary critic, who lived in the vicarage while her dad was away at the war, he passed on his bibliophilia - plus, her parents reckoned when she became pregnant in the sixth form, his wantonness. Hence the atavistic bad blood of the title. But books saw her break through to university. She and the baby's father became the first married couple in the country to graduate together. This deservedly prize-winning account of childhood in the 1940s and 1950s is moving and bleakly funny. It would have been best told by the author, but alas she died. Her story is beautifully served by Jenny Agutter, who reads it with conviction, sympathy and, one senses, more than a little recognition.",

And as they are black, and feel personally aggrieved, Silk is compelled to take a resentful and unplanned early retirement. His wife dies of a stroke, which for a while completely unhinges him. And then, to make things worse, Silk - who is 71 - takes on a 34-year-old mistress, an illiterate woman who works as a cleaner. This is where the novel begins, Silk having struck up an unlikely friendship with our old, dear and now cancer-riddled friend, the reclusive Nathan Zuckerman. </p> <p>We are, then, in the thick of an America revelling in an ecstasy of recrimination, the \"malevolent puritanism\" worse than any cold-war hunt for imaginary communists. This urge to denounce inappropriate behaviour prevents people from saying anything that goes against the consensus and has resulted, deliberately or not, in the dumbest generation in American history and the kind of atmosphere where a student can successfully complain that the plays of Euripides are misogynist and should not be taught. It is perhaps a calculated affront to this way of \"thinking\" that there is a short scene in the novel where Coleman overhears three men arguing that Clinton could have spared himself public embarrassment by placing his penis inside Monica Lewinsky's rectum rather than her mouth. \"Had he fucked her in the ass, the nation could have been spared this terrible trauma.\" Well, that's one theory, and it's interesting that this is more or less the last word the novel has to say on the matter; and that we're meant to find it - as, personally, I do - grimly funny. </p> <p>Yet this, being a novel by someone who seems at the peak of his very considerable powers (whereas Zuckerman is not only impotent but, as a result of a prostate operation, incontinent; very much a minor player here, he has stopped, so to speak, dicking us around), is not the whole story. Silk has a momentous secret, and although you find it out early on (and may remember it from reviews of the hardback), I will urge you, as I have never urged before, to buy the book and discover it for yourself. The stuff about dumb, hysterical America is, it turns out, only background noise, the backdrop to a picture of a century where matters of race, ambition, character and war come together like a car crash. It is a fizzing, unplayable spitball of a book, almost unfairly brilliant, its sentences the familiar Roth string of ungainsayable urgency, intelligence and passion. </p> <p>This novel not only stares death - \"the ceaseless perishing\" - in the face, it stares the whole unruly parade of our lives in the face, and declares, more eloquently and persuasively than anything else you will have read on the subject, that we are imperfect fabricators of our own destinies. And, by the way, that as a novelist Roth is in a league of his own.</p>",

This urge to denounce inappropriate behaviour prevents people from saying anything that goes against the consensus and has resulted, deliberately or not, in the dumbest generation in American history and the kind of atmosphere where a student can successfully complain that the plays of Euripides are misogynist and should not be taught. It is perhaps a calculated affront to this way of \"thinking\" that there is a short scene in the novel where Coleman overhears three men arguing that Clinton could have spared himself public embarrassment by placing his penis inside Monica Lewinsky's rectum rather than her mouth. \"Had he fucked her in the ass, the nation could have been spared this terrible trauma.\" Well, that's one theory, and it's interesting that this is more or less the last word the novel has to say on the matter; and that we're meant to find it - as, personally, I do - grimly funny. Yet this, being a novel by someone who seems at the peak of his very considerable powers (whereas Zuckerman is not only impotent but, as a result of a prostate operation, incontinent; very much a minor player here, he has stopped, so to speak, dicking us around), is not the whole story. Silk has a momentous secret, and although you find it out early on (and may remember it from reviews of the hardback), I will urge you, as I have never urged before, to buy the book and discover it for yourself. The stuff about dumb, hysterical America is, it turns out, only background noise, the backdrop to a picture of a century where matters of race, ambition, character and war come together like a car crash. It is a fizzing, unplayable spitball of a book, almost unfairly brilliant, its sentences the familiar Roth string of ungainsayable urgency, intelligence and passion. This novel not only stares death - \"the ceaseless perishing\" - in the face, it stares the whole unruly parade of our lives in the face, and declares, more eloquently and persuasively than anything else you will have read on the subject, that we are imperfect fabricators of our own destinies. And, by the way, that as a novelist Roth is in a league of his own.",

Genesis being a story, the philosophy of divine creativity is not dwelt upon - it is taken as read that creating is what God does. As George Steiner explains, however, the business of genesis has never in reality been that unproblematic. </p> <p>How, for instance, did the gods themselves come into being in the first place? This was the conundrum underlying so many ancient myths. And then, having got that far, did deities or the Deity truly, as Judaeo-Christianity teaches, create out of nothing ( ex nihilo ); or was it, as in most other traditions, a matter of some celestial ordering of chaos, imposing form on mucky, pre-existent Ur-stuff? And did the Almighty create because He had no choice (creativity being the divine essence)? Or because He willed it (it was His foible)? Or even, as has been read by some theologians out of, or into, the Old Testament account, because He was a bit lonely? Not least, how do we account for the creation of evil? </p> <p>These are the grand questions posed in a study that is philosophical in conception, yet deeply humane too. Steiner engages, as we'd expect, with the weighty theologies and philosophies that have debated these fundamental issues - from Plato, Aristotle and Aquinas up to the moderns, including Hegel, Husserl and Heidegger. Yet he also evokes the personal side. Here is the tormented Job shaking his head or fist at a Yahweh who seems to have created him solely to make him suffer. What sense lies in a Creation that inflicts pointless pain? This objection is drawn out of Job's agony and brought right forward, in Steiner's masterly telling, to that \"virtuoso of abstention\", Samuel Beckett. Why not nothing? Is the real problem with existence not Godot's absence but God's presence? </p> <p>These issues might be waved aside as \"academic\" - no longer relevant in an age in which God is dead. But this would be wrong because, as Steiner persuasively argues, they are the very problems present whenever we confront a poem or a painting, especially in an electronic age when old ideas about language are under threat. Why do we set such a high value on originality in art? Why call this lyric or that sonata a work of genius? What are the distinguishing features of (in today's jargon) \"creative\" writing? What is the point of art? </p> <p>Music, for instance, has been commended as uniquely creative on the grounds that it is \"pure\" - it doesn't merely imitate sounds that are out there already. Yet we will often praise a novel for its \"realism\" or a portrait for being \"lifelike\": does that make the novelist or painter any the less \"creative\"? And if so, does it matter? </p> <p>And the enigma of the creator in the imaginative arts applies equally, Steiner shows, to other fields. Some celebrate mathematics as the most original human endeavour of all, precisely because pure maths, at least, is all in the mind. The scientist, however, occupies a more ambiguous position. As a discoverer, he or she is granted higher status than the \"inventor\" who is a mere \"maker\" or \"fabricator\" - a word always carrying undertones of \"fiction\". Yet since we idolise a Galileo or a Newton for removing Nature's veil and \"discovering\" her eternal laws, how can they truly claim a place in the pantheon of \"creators\"? </p> <p>The concentricity of these theologies, philosophies and aesthetics of creation is brought home by Steiner through a brilliant reading of Dante. For that 13th-century Florentine, God alone could create; what redeemed man was faith. It was not until romanticism, half a millennium later, that creativity marked the destiny of the writer, the poet's imagination became divine and art was deemed redemptive. Critics denounced those claims as blasphemous, and the compulsion to create became the destructive demon of the romantic agony, especially once the joy of creating degenerated into fin-de-si\u00e8cle creation as pathology. It was not only Freud who viewed art as symptomatic of neurosis. </p> <p>Indeed, the hubris involved in the artist's claim to godlike creative powers has been but part of that terrible modern malaise that not only produced Nazism and Stalinism, but conscripted art to consecrate such barbarism: the familiar Hitler and Wagner problem, a variant on God creating evil. Here Steiner takes up again a theme he has pursued before: in the shadow of the Shoah, might the nothingness of silence be the only honourable recourse for art? </p> <p>An astonishing wealth of ideas has been compressed within the compass of this book. However, significant omissions and blind spots remain. Despite the odd stray reference to Star Trek , the question of what kinds of grammars of creation apply to such modern media as film is not broached. And Steiner's troupe of poets and philosophers is conspicuously men-only. I point this out not to make a cheap, politically correct point, but to go some way towards explaining the absence from his discussion of one major matrix of thinking about creativity. </p> <p>For artistic creativity has often been conceived in terms of conception itself - begetting, giving birth, artwork as brainchild. Here the models and metaphors have been sexual (pens and penises), gynaecological, obstetrical, paediatric: a writer goes into the throes of labour, a poem is delivered into the world. Our word \"genius\" comes from gignere , Latin for \"to beget\" or \"to be born\". And there are conceits that have been particularly dear to female writers, but far from exclusively so. They bring with them rich possibilities: a bastard or monstrous offspring, or endless variations on the theme of the muse as the \"onely begetter\". Steiner skirts these \"low\", bodily traditions of thinking about creation. </p> <p>Overall, however, this is a mesmerising book that demands and amply repays the closest attention. For breadth of culture and depth of erudition, Steiner has few peers. To those critics who have found his earlier works Olympian, oracular or obscure, the answer lies here: Grammars of Creation is a sustained outpouring of strenuous thinking, but it is expressed in prose that is unfailingly apt, luminous and evocative. From its earliest propositions (\"this book is an in memoriam for lost futures\"), arguments flow that hold the mind. What more fitting testament to Steiner's own prodigious creativity?</p>",

These have all been memorable, not least for their air of suppressed hysteria abetted by his own mad-professor appearance. </p> <p> The River Cottage Cookbook arises out of the series rather than merely replicating the visual experience. It's chunky, with pages of instruction for would-be smallholders, hunter-gatherers and gardeners. The text is peppered with cookery wisdom and lore although, in fact, there are fewer than 100 stand-alone recipes. These are good stuff, albeit heavily garlicked and raddled with chilli - but then, so is most food nowadays. There are two things to applaud: first, that many of the dishes are one-pot affairs, in other words, good family cooking (though how many children will tuck in willingly to squirrel shanks or pig's ear is questionable); and second, that he is not afraid to make terrines, patties, pies, stews - old-fashioned, messed-about cookery that many fashionable cooks shy away from. </p> <p>Most people will turn to this book for a broader take on food in general. The River Cottage project is a dabble in the art of self-sufficiency: raise the pig to kill, then work out what to do with all the parts; sow the carrots and reap the soup. And it includes the wild world: almost a third deals with fish and food gathered in hedgerow and woodland. </p> <p>But although we are all peasants at heart - or at least think so as we board the 8.05 - few make the transition from town to rustic bliss. For the stay-at-homes, there's lots about shopping: what to look for in a ripe melon, how to tell fresh from foul. For those who like a little activity, there are things to do on walks (shoot squirrels, pick blackberries, harvest mussels), and for the driven, all they need to know about home-smoking, eel traps and egg-laying. Farmer Hugh would like even the do- nothings to appreciate better our place in the food chain. </p> <p>As a manual, it has plenty of gaps (nothing on dairy work, no mention of goats, geese or ducks) and suffers from the usual problem of DIY books: over-optimism. The reality of smallholding, or even self-sufficiency of The Good Life variety, is that it's hell most of the time. Hugh's breezy canter through the hurdles of pigs, sheep and cows makes light of the 2am breech birth, the psychotic sow unable to bear its own offspring, or the ram intent on flattening any human that comes within range. So, too, in the garden. I have planted orchards of apple trees, yet am still without fruit; waited months for parsley to germinate; and spent millions at garden centres. Now, I visit the greengrocer. </p> <p>Reservations notwithstanding, the book is still necessary. By travelling from one end to the other of an animal's life (or a carrot's) he gives perspective to what we eat, even if at the last gasp you leave it to those more versed in the niceties. And it's worth it for the pig alone: like George Orwell, Fearnley-Whittingstall recognises the pig's supremacy of wit, charm, beauty and, finally, taste. Even the urban dreamer can take instruction in pickling belly or smoking bacon. This is rippingly good, and the product 10 times more enjoyable than pancetta. </p> <p>Whether you think the writer well served by his publisher may depend on your approach to book-craft. A cookbook is meant to be used; the present generation of book designers seems to think otherwise. Margins are small, type is smaller, reading at a distance (as you do at the stove) impossible. Instead of diagrams (which you need to learn about skinning rabbits and eviscerating cuttlefish), what you get is mood photography. Who needs a photograph of a bowl of soup? It's green and flat, and the china is white. Mood is the writer's job, and Farmer Hugh is up to it. </p> <p>If Fearnley-Whittingstall's book is the size and weight of a brick, Colette Rossant's memoir of her wartime Egyptian childhood is a slender bookmark. First published in America, it combines explicit memories with their evocation through recipes. I always have more faith in memoirists if they know how old they are, and this one does not.

The songs he's written, with and without John Lennon, have almost certainly reached more listeners than all the official poems of all the poets laureate put together - and a good thing too. The lyrics of many of the songs, along with the best of Woody Guthrie, Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Ray Davies, Patti Smith and other transatlantic troubadours, remain pacesetters to the movement that's achieved the big shift towards more people getting their poetry by ear again over the last half century. Some say pop lyrics can't be poetry - a grotesquely unhistorical prejudice. Lyric denotes \"poetry sung to the lyre\", which is how the craft began in the hands of David, Solomon, Sappho, Homer et al. Pop, short for popular, means \"of the people\". </p> <p>In 1964 Adrian Mitchell wrote in his first book of poems that \"Most people ignore most poetry because most poetry ignores most people\" - as did most mid-century hit-parade fodder. But many more people today are relating to more poetry, because more poetry - like much recent pop song - has been relating to the realities of many more people. The interplay between poets and singer-songwriter-musicians has been crucial to this development, putting the lyre back into the lyric and original lyrics back into music and verse. At Liverpool art school in the late 1950s, Lennon edited \"The Daily Howl\" in homage to the protest poems of Allen Ginsberg, who was accompanied in his old age on stage and disc by McCartney. </p> <p>Mitchell writes in his introduction to Blackbird Singing that \"one of the highlights of my life was performing four of my poems backed by Paul, Linda and their band on the Southend leg of his world tour in 1991. Around that time Linda phoned me to suggest that I edit a collection of Paul's poems.\" When it came to the nitty-gritty of publication, Mitchell's role was pivotal. Macca admits that \"Originally I only wanted poems in the book, but Adrian persuaded me into including the song lyrics. I looked at them again, and thought, yes, some of them could be read.\" </p> <p>Mitchell emphasises that \"Paul is not in the line of academic or modernist poets. He is a poet in the tradition of popular poetry. Homer was and is a popular poet, understood and loved by millions of people who never saw a university. William Blake, who used to sing his Songs of Innocence and Experience to a small circle of friends, has become one of the most popular of all poets. Whenever critics say there is something inferior about poetry which is sung, my advice is to sing Blake's 'Tyger' or Burns's 'O My Luve's Like a Red, Red Rose' at them. A few songwriters, although they know you can get away with banal nothingness in pop lyrics, have a vision and try to convey it to us. A few manage to write truthfully about the world.\" Quite apart from his strengths as a composer, musician and vocalist, this is exactly what McCartney has done in nearly as many songs as Blake did. </p> <p>The new book is made up of about 50 song lyrics and close on 100 non-musical pieces. It may be partly because they have been the soundtrack to the best years of my life, but it's mainly the lyrics that strike poetic gold for me. Many of the unsung texts read more like sketches or notes than finished poems - as might be expected of any aspiring poet's first volume (regardless of the fact that this poet has been a master songsmith for four decades). </p> <p>The craft and hard graft of writing nonstop for gigs, broadcasts and recordings left hardly a wasted syllable in the most verbally intricate of the songs. J K Rowling spoke for thousands of writers when she said on Desert Island Discs last Christmas that the most precious and elusive skill is simplicity - and she surely spoke for millions of readers and listeners when she cited \"Yesterday\" as a classic example. She might equally have chosen \"Blackbird\" or \"Big Boys Bickering\", which marry McCartney's liquid sweetness to a punchy, unblinking social conscience: \"Who will win, who will lose? / Which way do the big boys choose? // While they argue through the night, / Shaking their sticks of dynamite, / Babies are dying through the day, / They want to blow us all away . . .\" </p> <p>I love McCartney as I do Shakespeare, the Marx Brothers, Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong, because I find the ups and downs of existence so intensely immortalised in his work. Other lyrics here that portray unmistakably universal experience include the poignant \"Eleanor Rigby\" and \"When I'm Sixty-Four\", and the sharply observed \"She's Leaving Home\" and \"Lovely Rita\". Each of these is built on lines far more comparable with Robert Browning, to my mind, than Eminem's rap attacks were set up to be by Giles Foden in the Guardian . The couplets, \"I could be handy, mending a fuse / When your lights have gone. / You can knit a sweater by the fireside, / Sunday mornings go for a ride\" and \"Indicate precisely what you want to say, / Yours sincerely, wasting away\" read like a jaunty Scouse music-hall rejoinder to Gregory Corso's wild beatnik variations on \"Marriage\", with their cri de coeur : \"What if I'm 60 years old and not married, / all alone in a furnished room with pee stains on my underwear\". </p> <p>The way every detail of the \"Penny Lane\" street scene comes together - from the \"barber showing photographs / Of every head he's had the pleasure to know\" (hear him saying it!) to the nurse selling poppies from a tray \"Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout\" who \"feels as if she's in a play\" - is as atmospheric and revealing as the market walkabout in Browning's \"How It Strikes a Contemporary\". Both Eminem and Browning are generally too preoccupied with technical effects to achieve the televisual succinctness with which McCartney records the nuances in tone, vocabulary and naked human emotion of the diverse folk befriended in his songs. </p> <p>Most of these lyrics, like most worthwhile poems, will be as reso nant long after we're all dead as when they were first released, perhaps most notably the compassionate but unsentimental requiem for \"all the lonely people\" penned by Macca, with a little help from his friends, in 1966. \"Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name. / Nobody came. / Father McKenzie, / wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave. / No one was saved . . .\" One needn't chase the sub-textual possibilities of \"Nobody came\" to sense that it's not a million miles from Betjeman and Larkinland; or to see why William Burroughs admired McCartney's talent for packing such a wealth of narrative into so few lines, or why another distinguished novelist, A S Byatt, finds it \"a perfect sung lyric . . . with the minimalist perfection of a Beckett story\". </p> <p>So what of the other two-thirds of this collection? Macca's Sunday-painter's eye and seasoned musician's ear too often get muffled by imprecise doodles -in \"City Park\", \"All sorts of ducks / Mill slowly round white swans\" just two breaths away from where \"A crow cackles / With thumb on black comb rasp\". The \"Mill slowly round\" and \"black comb rasp\" are sure-footed poesy, but \"All sorts of\" is uninformative prose and \"crow cackles\" is routine clich\u00e9. </p> <p>On the other hand, the nine-page \"Standing Stone\" sequence, more than four times the length of anything else included, is a remarkable feat of historical imagination - a primeval redemption myth whose sustained narrative detachment bursts into a subtly orchestrated lyric orgasm. It evokes the whole-earth mystique that has gathered such practical momentum since the 1960s (partly thanks to campaigning by the likes of Linda and Paul): \"On contented drone of bee / musicians improvise a melody / fuelled by feast fermented fruit. / Sun-cooked air blew through flutes / and round bright maypole strings / a jig in plaited time . . . / Birds and butterflies flit / from wayside bush and ditch. / The track from town to stone / soon jammed with revellers / inching chattily towards/ their sacred site / where she and he / vow their proud love . . . // A distant black bird circled overhead and wondered why / so many bite-sized creatures spent their lifetime / running on the spot.\" </p> <p>About 20 pages are devoted to Paul's late wife and muse, and though they are uneven (sometimes because of their palpable sincerity), they contain meditative lines that will speak volumes to anyone who has experienced the solitary confinement that follows the loss of a soulmate. \"My love is alive / My love is dead // I hear her voice / inside my head // There's a lot to remember / a lot to forget// . . . There's a lot to be said / There's nothing to be said\". </p> <p>McCartney has observed how many of these poems stem from grief and bereavement, carrying a greater personal weight than the songs. But most illustrate - and a good many fulfill - his perennial life-enhancing \"Hey Jude\" riff: \"don't make it bad, / Take a sad song and make it better\". Though some of the poeticising is as formally slipshod as most of the songcraft is immaculate, every page of this profoundly innocent and vastly enjoyable toybox of a book is pure in spirit - the purity of the actor said to have complained to Sam Beckett in rehearsal, \"It's no good, I'm failing\", and the purity of the reply attributed to Beckett: \"That's all right. But try to fail better.\"</p>",

Dotty Constance Reason lives in Dunsinane, a decrepit country house in Sussex, sustained by the companionship of her dog, the odd ghostly visitation from Wilfred (the late husband who never quite recovered from shell shock) and her memories of youthful indiscretions in Shanghai with a bohemian ne'er-do-well. Just up the road, her mannish niece Iseult struggles stoically with the family farm and her monstrously theatrical mother, Leonora, in equal measure.

And so it is that poor Sandy, a decent-enough chap being driven half mad with unconsummated lust, comes to find himself creeping about Dunsinane doctoring cups of cocoa, toying with pillows and wrestling with his conscience. A highly unsuitable Macbeth, he has also to contend with the long-smothered attentions of Iseult, who has never quite cottoned on to the fact that he might not be that kind of chap. </p> <p>Koning's aptitude for an accomplished comedy of manners, jauntily arranged and never too far from resolution, makes this an amiable novel that skates lightly over the surface of rather darker waters. We never, for example, get much further with Connie's compromised past, nor with her stalled relationship with the ruined Wilfred. Nor does the loutish Ray become a great deal more than a nasty piece of work whose menace will, at some point, be neutralised by the straightforward virtues of Connie and Iseult. </p> <p>But even if the characters verge on the two-dimensional and the plot comes to seem like a rather annoying set of hurdles to be toppled over, Fabulous Time remains a charming, old-fashioned entertainment: a gentle farce in a pleasant setting that will deliver to its protagonists their just deserts - aside from one or two rather extravagant sacrifices. Bereft of any particularly challenging explorations of motive, daring experimental forays or plot developments that you can't see coming straight over the Sussex Downs, it will doubtless translate effortlessly into a comforting piece of Sunday-night drama. The flower-power set piece, in which the hippies, a clutch of rock stars and their groupies, wreath Dunsinane in spliff smoke and nudity, will look especially well - its finale the moment when the ancient chandelier crashes to the ground. As an emblem of the passing of the ruling class, it's a little creaky; as a comic interlude in a highly enjoyable piece of whimsy, it just about does the trick.</p>",

Beginning with gallery owner F\u00e9lix Ferrer leaving his wife, the story mainly concerns his trip to the Arctic in an icebreaker to salvage (and, he hopes, sell) a collection of Inuit artefacts abandoned in a ship that has been trapped in the floes for 40 years. He has been put on to this scam by the \"competent pundit\" Delahaye, one of his acquisition advisers at the gallery. </p> <p>In his mid-50s, Ferrer is an inveterate womaniser and fugitive from responsibility. During the journey on the icebreaker, he tries to tempt the delicious nurse Brigitte away from her regular boyfriend for some illicit canoodling. As well as being the nurse, Brigitte also runs the ship's video library, logging out Rio Bravo or The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse with the same indulgent smile as The Check-Out Girls or The Voracious Alumna . </p> <p>This indulgence of both high and low culture (of virtually anything at all, in fact - the whole shoot) is very much Jean Echenoz's own approach, and the reason why he has so rapidly become France's leading writer, with only five novels prior to this one under his belt. The last was Lake , the tale of secret agent Franck Chopin, who has to deal with femme fatale Suzy Clair and the divagations of some live bugs (trained flies fitted with mini microphones). It was, said Le Figaro , \"a diabolical thriller, but also the most accomplished parody of its genre\". </p> <p>In I'm Off , Echenoz continues to throw custard pies at literary norms, in particular the machinery of your average novel. But the custard itself is of a very high quality. When he mocks the flashback, for instance, he does it so suavely - \"What was not working so well, six months earlier, was business at the gallery\" - that we swallow the tired convention whole. </p> <p>Flash-forwards are employed just as slyly: \"But had he been told that each one of the three people gathered in his flat this evening was about to disappear in his or her own way before the month was out, not excluding himself, he would have been considerably alarmed.\" </p> <p>With reference to the Inuit guides who accompany Ferrer on the latter part of his trip (during which sleigh dogs eat a frozen mastodon), Echenoz also mocks the technical notation espoused by the likes of Tom Clancy: \"They are equipped with carbines (Savage 116 FFS All-weather), binoculars (15x15 IS with image stabiliser), knives and whips. Napaseekadlak's knife has an oosik handle, a bone that stands in for a walrus's sexual organ, and whose suppleness, resistance and porosity are ideal for a firm grip. Angutretrok's knife is less traditional, a White Hunter II Puma with a Kraton handle.\" </p> <p>Often, an authorial voice butts nonchalantly into the action: \"Now, if you'll permit me, for a change of scene, to join the man who answers to the name of Baumgartner.\" This is the alias of the villain who contracts a junkie thief called Le Fl\u00e9tan to steal the artworks. </p> <p>Before Le Fl\u00e9tan meets a miserable end - the fact that his name translates as \"the halibut\" gives a clue as to how - his covert dealings with Baumgartner are brilliantly done. \"On Place de la Porte de Chatillon, Le Fl\u00e9tan double-parked by a telephone box. He got out, entered, lifted the receiver. He appeared to be given a laconic reply then, bequeathing a few of his molecules to the handset - a gob of earwax blocking the perforation of the earpiece, a drop of saliva in an orifice of the mouthpiece - he hung up and raised an eyebrow.\" </p> <p>Echenoz himself is always writing with one eyebrow raised, especially when dealing with narrative time, which he handles as ironically as Beckett: \"The days, thereafter, trickled by, for lack of alternative, in the customary order.\" Or: \"Let us also continue to make progress, now, let us speed up.\" Or: \"But isn't it about time Ferrer got himself sorted out?\" </p> <p>The question of how the novel paces itself is bound up with the women Ferrer seduces in the course of it. \"So he found himself more than ever in a womanless condition but, knowing him, it wouldn't last. Just a matter of time.\" </p> <p>Having breached a chapter division, we are then presented with these lines: \"Well, what did we say? Not two days have passed and here's one already.\" The subject of Ferrer's seduction this time around is Sonia, who is assisting in the valuation of the artworks. The start of the liaison with her is conducted in the conditional of Ferrer's randy hopes: \"It was a fine day, it would be good to take a table outside, and the account of Ferrer's journey was bound to interest the girl, indeed to fascinate her - to such a degree that she'd switch off her mobile and light one cigarette after another\". But all this turns out, almost imperceptibly, to be for real. It's a typical Echenoz trick. </p> <p>An hour or so later and the lovers are moving through her apartment in \"a clumsy sideways dance, like two crabs enlaced, towards Sonia's bedroom, where a black bra could be unfastened and dropped gently onto the rug in this room like an outsize pair of sunglasses\". </p> <p>That is just one of many extra-ordinary images in an extraordinary book. In France, where he has been compared to Queneau (one might also mention Sterne), Echenoz is perceived as leader of the so-called \"\u00e9cole du d\u00e9risoire\", the school of the derisory, for want of a better translation. This refers to the way he and others \"deride\" the exhausted literary tropes of various genres, whether they be the Hitchcock-style whodunnit, the spy novel or the Conradian adventure yarn. </p> <p>Of course, there is nothing new about this: Conrad himself did the same thing with the naval novels of Captain Marryat and books such as R M Ballantyne's The Coral Island . Writers have always adapted generic traditions for their own ends. The difference with Echenoz seems to be that he does not see himself as adding to a tradition through its alteration, but simply fending off absurdity. \"Better to laugh,\" as he has said in one interview. \"Otherwise things tend to be . . . un peu catastrophique, n'est-ce pas ?\" Yet in the books themselves this fending off becomes, almost in spite of itself, a fresh and amazingly graceful way of looking at the world.</p>",

      "byline": "Roy Collins",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Joe Kinnear has never been one to resist a laugh at his own expense. So he enjoyed a good chuckle behind the wheel of his car when he heard a radio reporter suggesting that by leaving Oxford to become the Luton Town manager he was swapping a club with both feet in the Second Division grave to a club with only one. </p> <p>There was, however, a compelling reason for Kinnear's switch a month ago. Buying and selling players for Oxford on a freelance basis, with no input into the team, he just did not feel involved enough, did not feel any real sense of fulfilment. </p> <p>After almost two years' recuperation since his heart attack in March 1999, he was desperate to start yelling at players on the training field again and begin moulding and building another team. And any new club's league position was irrelevant, Kinnear just wanted to feel like he was making a difference again. </p> <p>He realised how badly he was longing for a return when he bumped into Sir Alex Ferguson before last summer's Euro 2000 final and Fergie casually broached the subject of whether he had considered going back into management. Kinnear was surprised to hear himself say: \"Christ, I'd go back in the morning.\" </p> <p>After 18 months of hospital visits and cholesterol checks and heart monitoring and, worst of all, sensible eating, Kinnear felt he was ready when Sheffield Wednesday came calling in the summer. </p> <p>\"I was desperate to take the job and I spent a week up there looking round,\" he says. \"They're a massive club and the contract was terrific and the money tremendous. But I wanted to be a hero in the job, I wanted to go in and blow a trumpet and take them straight back into the Premiership. </p> <p>\"The more they told me, the more I realised that would be impossible. They were something like \u00a336m in debt and the banks wanted \u00a316m of that immediately. So my first job would have been to sell half the team. I loved everything about the place but I thought the challenge was unfair.\" </p> <p>He laughs again when he recalls his words to the Wednesday directors, that it would be a struggle for survival, when that is just the task he has taken on at Kenilworth Road. He does, though, see a club trying to move forward rather than one stuck in reverse, perhaps fatally so. </p> <p>The challenge he has been offered by the Luton chairman Mike Watson-Challis is to build a team in the next 3 years to fill the 18,000 all-seater stadium near junction 10 of the M1 that should be finished by 2003. </p> <p>He says: \"The way I break that down is for us to stay up this season and then have a punt next year, maybe getting into the play-offs and, if not, get promoted the following year.

      "bodyText": "Joe Kinnear has never been one to resist a laugh at his own expense. So he enjoyed a good chuckle behind the wheel of his car when he heard a radio reporter suggesting that by leaving Oxford to become the Luton Town manager he was swapping a club with both feet in the Second Division grave to a club with only one. There was, however, a compelling reason for Kinnear's switch a month ago. Buying and selling players for Oxford on a freelance basis, with no input into the team, he just did not feel involved enough, did not feel any real sense of fulfilment. After almost two years' recuperation since his heart attack in March 1999, he was desperate to start yelling at players on the training field again and begin moulding and building another team. And any new club's league position was irrelevant, Kinnear just wanted to feel like he was making a difference again. He realised how badly he was longing for a return when he bumped into Sir Alex Ferguson before last summer's Euro 2000 final and Fergie casually broached the subject of whether he had considered going back into management. Kinnear was surprised to hear himself say: \"Christ, I'd go back in the morning.\" After 18 months of hospital visits and cholesterol checks and heart monitoring and, worst of all, sensible eating, Kinnear felt he was ready when Sheffield Wednesday came calling in the summer. \"I was desperate to take the job and I spent a week up there looking round,\" he says. \"They're a massive club and the contract was terrific and the money tremendous. But I wanted to be a hero in the job, I wanted to go in and blow a trumpet and take them straight back into the Premiership. \"The more they told me, the more I realised that would be impossible. They were something like \u00a336m in debt and the banks wanted \u00a316m of that immediately. So my first job would have been to sell half the team. I loved everything about the place but I thought the challenge was unfair.\" He laughs again when he recalls his words to the Wednesday directors, that it would be a struggle for survival, when that is just the task he has taken on at Kenilworth Road. He does, though, see a club trying to move forward rather than one stuck in reverse, perhaps fatally so. The challenge he has been offered by the Luton chairman Mike Watson-Challis is to build a team in the next 3 years to fill the 18,000 all-seater stadium near junction 10 of the M1 that should be finished by 2003. He says: \"The way I break that down is for us to stay up this season and then have a punt next year, maybe getting into the play-offs and, if not, get promoted the following year. And once you're in the First Division, everyone starts dreaming of the Premiership. Sounds simple doesn't it?\" He believes he has inherited a nucleus of young players similar to those he found at Wimbledon. Liam George, an Irish Under-21 striker, his partner up front Stuart Douglas, 20, and the defenders Matthew Taylor and Emmerson Boyce, are all players who Kinnear describes as having \"massive potential\". He also has a small kitty to spend before next week's transfer deadline - Kinnear has had discussions recently with the former Leicester striker Steve Claridge about signing a short-term contract with Luton - though he was not encouraged by a visit to a reserve game between Watford and West Ham. \"West Ham had Titi Camara and Kaba Diawara up front and Paul Kitson on the bench.

      "byline": "Richard Williams",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Tomorrow night Sven-Goran Eriksson will announce his list of 25 players for the forthcoming World Cup qualifying matches against Finland and Albania. In reducing the size of his squad from the 31 convened for last month's encouraging friendly against Spain the coach will be providing a clearer idea of the nature of his discoveries since his arrival in England. And the events of the next 10 days will tell us a great deal more than we currently know about England's standing in the world of football. </p> <p>The latest Fifa rankings, released this week, placed England 16th among the world's 203 footballing nations. Brazil, France, Argentina, Portugal and Italy comprise the top five. England are sandwiched between Colombia and Croatia - which might be a fraction generous, taking a slightly broader view of recent history, since the Croatians finished third in the last World Cup while England failed to make it into the quarter-finals. </p> <p>And yet this week the English Premier League achieved the feat of placing three clubs - Manchester United, Arsenal and Leeds United - in the last eight of the Champions League, matching the performance of Spain's Liga and totally eclipsing Italy's Serie A, whose last representative was ejected on Tuesday night. A certain amount of self-congratulation was only to be expected. </p> <p>No one really knows, however, which statistic is the more reliable indicator of the health of English football. What will it mean, for example, if all three Premier League clubs are eliminated in next month's quarter-finals? If, on the other hand, England provide both finalists, as Spain did last year, and Eriksson leads the national team to resounding victories next Saturday and the following Wednesday, would we be right to conclude that, after last year's traumas, the domestic game has been returned to life? </p> <p>Eriksson's debut, in last month's widely applauded 3-0 win in a friendly against Spain, justifiably reawakened hopes of qualification for the World Cup finals in 2002. Suddenly the prospect of group matches against Germany and Greece, as well as Finland and Albania, did not seem so daunting. The feeling was quick to arise that, if Eriksson could continue his work of getting the players to observe the basic technical and tactical principles of football at international level, then the dismal opening to the campaign - a single point from matches against Germany and Finland - might yet be overcome. </p> <p>\"It's a very good new start for English football,\" Christian Damiano, Jean Tigana's assistant at Fulham, said yesterday. Damiano was one of the coaches who plotted France's ascent to the glories of 1998, as national director of youth development and Aime Jacquet's assistant coach with the World Cup-winning squad. \"Eriksson's team played well against Spain,\" he continued, \"at a time when Spanish football is a reference point. The players seemed to have a new confidence.\" </p> <p>It is hard to imagine that Eriksson has been the recipient of any blinding revelations since he watched his inaugural selection function with such unfamiliar but welcome efficiency at Villa Park. The chances are that his starting XI against Finland at Anfield next Saturday will closely resemble the one that began the game against Spain. </p> <p>Perhaps, if the coach is in a conservative mood, David Seaman will replace David James. If he is feeling adventurous, Ashley Cole may take over from the 31-year-old Chris Powell, even though the Charlton left-back performed brightly enough in Eriksson's first match to be hopeful of keeping his place for the second. </p> <p>The elimination of Nick Barmby, removed from the reckoning by an ankle injury, would appear to open a place on the left of midfield for Steven Gerrard, his Liverpool team-mate. Gerrard's long-standing fitness problem rendered him unavailable for selection for the first squad, but against Porto at Anfield in Thursday night's Uefa Cup tie he produced a performance of such energy and commitment that the watching Swede could hardly fail to have been impressed all over again. Andy Cole and Michael Owen would be right to feel aggrieved if they were not given another opportunity to establish their credentials as a partnership. On current form, however, David Beckham would probably be replaced by Steve McManaman, with Sol Campbell taking the captaincy. </p> <p>McManaman has been in increasingly impressive form for Real Madrid, scoring against Real Sociedad last weekend and being rested for the trip to Anderlecht on Wednesday, when they lost their \"dead\" Champions League group match 2-0. It would be good to see Eriksson recognising and exploiting the strength of character which saw him through last summer's ordeal. But the type of football McManaman has learnt to play in Madrid, with its disciplined use of fast-moving triangles, might not have best prepared him for the sort of tactics he is likely to find England operating, even under Eriksson's relatively enlightened tutelage, although it would be nice to think that one day it could. </p> <p>Once again, however, the team's backbone is likely to be provided by the Manchester United contingent. Five of them started against Spain and it is unlikely that fewer will be chosen to confront Finland. </p> <p>\"It's very important,\" Damiano said, \"that, when international coaches only have the players for a few days at a time, they have a group of five or six or even seven players who are already synchronised with each other. In my view Manchester United are the best club team in Europe, perhaps the world, and I think that provides a very useful foundation for the England team.\" </p> <p>The ideal combination, of course, is a strong domestic league feeding a strong national team. But that, as many countries have found, is curiously difficult to achieve. France won the World Cup and the European Championship on the back of a hopelessly ineffectual league, virtually all their international players earning their living abroad. In Spain the situation is reversed: their clubs rule European competition while their national team cannot do more than give tantalising glimpses of their potential. </p> <p>In the case of England's renaissance, the thing to avoid is impatience, on and off the field. Eriksson's team beat Spain because they observed a sensible pattern and kept calm. Against Finland and Albania, of course, the atmosphere will be very different. World Cup qualifying points will be at stake. But the principles will be the same, and so should the players' state of mind.</p>",

And the events of the next 10 days will tell us a great deal more than we currently know about England's standing in the world of football. The latest Fifa rankings, released this week, placed England 16th among the world's 203 footballing nations. Brazil, France, Argentina, Portugal and Italy comprise the top five. England are sandwiched between Colombia and Croatia - which might be a fraction generous, taking a slightly broader view of recent history, since the Croatians finished third in the last World Cup while England failed to make it into the quarter-finals. And yet this week the English Premier League achieved the feat of placing three clubs - Manchester United, Arsenal and Leeds United - in the last eight of the Champions League, matching the performance of Spain's Liga and totally eclipsing Italy's Serie A, whose last representative was ejected on Tuesday night. A certain amount of self-congratulation was only to be expected. No one really knows, however, which statistic is the more reliable indicator of the health of English football. What will it mean, for example, if all three Premier League clubs are eliminated in next month's quarter-finals? If, on the other hand, England provide both finalists, as Spain did last year, and Eriksson leads the national team to resounding victories next Saturday and the following Wednesday, would we be right to conclude that, after last year's traumas, the domestic game has been returned to life? Eriksson's debut, in last month's widely applauded 3-0 win in a friendly against Spain, justifiably reawakened hopes of qualification for the World Cup finals in 2002. Suddenly the prospect of group matches against Germany and Greece, as well as Finland and Albania, did not seem so daunting. The feeling was quick to arise that, if Eriksson could continue his work of getting the players to observe the basic technical and tactical principles of football at international level, then the dismal opening to the campaign - a single point from matches against Germany and Finland - might yet be overcome. \"It's a very good new start for English football,\" Christian Damiano, Jean Tigana's assistant at Fulham, said yesterday. Damiano was one of the coaches who plotted France's ascent to the glories of 1998, as national director of youth development and Aime Jacquet's assistant coach with the World Cup-winning squad. \"Eriksson's team played well against Spain,\" he continued, \"at a time when Spanish football is a reference point. The players seemed to have a new confidence.\" It is hard to imagine that Eriksson has been the recipient of any blinding revelations since he watched his inaugural selection function with such unfamiliar but welcome efficiency at Villa Park. The chances are that his starting XI against Finland at Anfield next Saturday will closely resemble the one that began the game against Spain. Perhaps, if the coach is in a conservative mood, David Seaman will replace David James. If he is feeling adventurous, Ashley Cole may take over from the 31-year-old Chris Powell, even though the Charlton left-back performed brightly enough in Eriksson's first match to be hopeful of keeping his place for the second. The elimination of Nick Barmby, removed from the reckoning by an ankle injury, would appear to open a place on the left of midfield for Steven Gerrard, his Liverpool team-mate. Gerrard's long-standing fitness problem rendered him unavailable for selection for the first squad, but against Porto at Anfield in Thursday night's Uefa Cup tie he produced a performance of such energy and commitment that the watching Swede could hardly fail to have been impressed all over again. Andy Cole and Michael Owen would be right to feel aggrieved if they were not given another opportunity to establish their credentials as a partnership. On current form, however, David Beckham would probably be replaced by Steve McManaman, with Sol Campbell taking the captaincy. McManaman has been in increasingly impressive form for Real Madrid, scoring against Real Sociedad last weekend and being rested for the trip to Anderlecht on Wednesday, when they lost their \"dead\" Champions League group match 2-0. It would be good to see Eriksson recognising and exploiting the strength of character which saw him through last summer's ordeal. But the type of football McManaman has learnt to play in Madrid, with its disciplined use of fast-moving triangles, might not have best prepared him for the sort of tactics he is likely to find England operating, even under Eriksson's relatively enlightened tutelage, although it would be nice to think that one day it could. Once again, however, the team's backbone is likely to be provided by the Manchester United contingent. Five of them started against Spain and it is unlikely that fewer will be chosen to confront Finland. \"It's very important,\" Damiano said, \"that, when international coaches only have the players for a few days at a time, they have a group of five or six or even seven players who are already synchronised with each other. In my view Manchester United are the best club team in Europe, perhaps the world, and I think that provides a very useful foundation for the England team.\" The ideal combination, of course, is a strong domestic league feeding a strong national team. But that, as many countries have found, is curiously difficult to achieve. France won the World Cup and the European Championship on the back of a hopelessly ineffectual league, virtually all their international players earning their living abroad. In Spain the situation is reversed: their clubs rule European competition while their national team cannot do more than give tantalising glimpses of their potential. In the case of England's renaissance, the thing to avoid is impatience, on and off the field. Eriksson's team beat Spain because they observed a sensible pattern and kept calm. Against Finland and Albania, of course, the atmosphere will be very different. World Cup qualifying points will be at stake. But the principles will be the same, and so should the players' state of mind.",

He's relishing the prospect of bringing England here,\" said the Football Association's director of marketing Paul Barber. </p> <p>\"He had a significant say, as all the England coaching staff do, as to where we play the games.

The 67,000-capacity stadium drew the approval of the England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, a frequent visitor at Manchester United. \"Sven thinks the stadium is magnificent and that the atmosphere is fantastic. He's relishing the prospect of bringing England here,\" said the Football Association's director of marketing Paul Barber. \"He had a significant say, as all the England coaching staff do, as to where we play the games.

      "body": "<p>This time last year, investors, not wanting to peer too closely into a gift horse's mouth, were clamouring to feed money into the flotation of Lastminute.com. This week the same investors are feeling very silly indeed, as they have watched its share price, which hit an all-time high of 555p, plunge by around \u00a35. </p> <p>But sadly, lastminute.com investors are not alone: the story could be told about almost any technology stock in either the UK or the US markets. Even more prudent sorts, who chose to hedge their bets and invest in the technology sector via a collective vehicle, are finding the going little better. The thoroughbreds of last year's Isa season, Henderson Global Technology, SocGen Technology, Aberdeen Asset Management Technology, Jupiter Global Technology, Framlington, NetNet and Gartmore Technology Tornado funds have fallen by an average of 60%, with the Framlington fund tumbling furthest - by 74.7%. Most of the \u00a32.8bn in these trusts came from private individuals - retail money - rather than big institutions. </p> <p>So what should these people, many of whom were younger investors and recent converts to the stock market, but were excited about technology because they use it in their everyday lives, do with their falling assets? Has the horse already bolted, leaving only the door to shut? </p> <p>NetNet fund manager Chris Bell admits that things have been difficult. \"It's been an interesting year - 2000 started with a lot of optimism about technology investments and ended with complete pessimism. Hundreds of companies were chasing a market that did not really exist and were spending millions on advertising.\" </p> <p>Most investment experts agree, but this is not particularly helpful to the consumer. Amanda Davidson, director of advisers Holden Meehan, says: \"It's such a shame that just as people were starting to get their confidence in the market it bombs. I really feel for people who have lost two-thirds of their money. But the message is, do not panic. When you invest in these volatile areas, you must have the faith to stay there, and people may find that they have to stay for longer than the original five years before they see profits.

      "bodyText": "This time last year, investors, not wanting to peer too closely into a gift horse's mouth, were clamouring to feed money into the flotation of Lastminute.com. This week the same investors are feeling very silly indeed, as they have watched its share price, which hit an all-time high of 555p, plunge by around \u00a35. But sadly, lastminute.com investors are not alone: the story could be told about almost any technology stock in either the UK or the US markets. Even more prudent sorts, who chose to hedge their bets and invest in the technology sector via a collective vehicle, are finding the going little better. The thoroughbreds of last year's Isa season, Henderson Global Technology, SocGen Technology, Aberdeen Asset Management Technology, Jupiter Global Technology, Framlington, NetNet and Gartmore Technology Tornado funds have fallen by an average of 60%, with the Framlington fund tumbling furthest - by 74.7%. Most of the \u00a32.8bn in these trusts came from private individuals - retail money - rather than big institutions. So what should these people, many of whom were younger investors and recent converts to the stock market, but were excited about technology because they use it in their everyday lives, do with their falling assets? Has the horse already bolted, leaving only the door to shut? NetNet fund manager Chris Bell admits that things have been difficult. \"It's been an interesting year - 2000 started with a lot of optimism about technology investments and ended with complete pessimism. Hundreds of companies were chasing a market that did not really exist and were spending millions on advertising.\" Most investment experts agree, but this is not particularly helpful to the consumer. Amanda Davidson, director of advisers Holden Meehan, says: \"It's such a shame that just as people were starting to get their confidence in the market it bombs. I really feel for people who have lost two-thirds of their money. But the message is, do not panic. When you invest in these volatile areas, you must have the faith to stay there, and people may find that they have to stay for longer than the original five years before they see profits. It could be a matter of waiting 10 years.\" She draws a parallel between this situation and clients who put money into the Far East. \"I have clients who went into Asian funds in 1993-5 whose investments have reached their original levels and are now making profits, but people who went in in the last two or three years are still having to wait.\" Jason Hollands, from Best Invest, says that investments are for the long term, and as the fundamentals - the whole investment story from product to management to market - are still good, if you already hold tech funds you should definitely hold on to them.

Sixteen years later there are still 1.3m small investors with BT shares, but the bonanza may be about to go into reverse. </p> <p>This week BT signalled that it is preparing the City for a record-breaking \u00a35bn cash call to shore up its finances - which one big stockbroker estimates will mean small shareholders being asked to stump up \u00a3500-\u00a3750 each in a \"rights issue\" .</p> <p>Someone who bought the standard allocation of BT shares at all three privatisation \"tranches\" in 1984, 1991 and 1993 and still holds them today is sitting on a tidy profit - they would have cost \u00a31,800 and be worth \u00a33,090 today, according to figures from Barclays Stockbrokers. But they would have been worth \u00a39,000 a year ago, and anybody who has bought BT shares over the past three years and holds them now has probably lost money. </p> <p>The BT share price edged ahead steadily from 1984 to 1997, but then soared as the stockmarket became transfixed by the potential profits from the mobile phone boom. </p> <p>At its peak in late 1999 the stock briefly hit \u00a315, but following this week's dramatic falls on the stock market was trading at around 515p. Its shares have been savaged by investors who wonder if the billions it paid for third-generation mobile phone licences will ever pay off. </p> <p>BT has accumulated a \u00a330bn debt mountain - equal to three-quarters of its stock market valuation - and had hoped to pay some of it back by selling off parts of the business. But the prices it could fetch - if it can find a buyer - are much lower than first predicted because of the sharp stock market downturn of recent months. </p> <p>\"It's pig-stuck with debt and has been slow to react to change. It still gets most of its income from land-lines, which everybody else is trying to get out of,\" says Justin Urquhart Stewart of Barclays Stockbrokers. </p> <p>\"They have got the choice of floating or selling off parts of the business, or going for a rights issue. Either the chairman, Sir Peter Vallance, or the chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield, will have to fall on their swords,\" he says. </p> <p>BT, once regarded as a potential global giant, is now regarded as a bit player on the world stage and has fallen far behind Vodafone in British investors' affections. \"There's no question of BT going bust, but will it exist in its current form in five years' time? It may be that it just becomes the junior partner of another international operation,\" says Mr Urquhart Stewart. </p> <p>So what should small shareholders do now? Sell out, hold on, or even buy more? </p> <p>Nomura, for example, has issued a \"sell\" note, which is based on a forecast that BT's profits will slide from the \u00a33.1bn it reported for 2000 to \u00a32bn in 2001 and only \u00a3459m in 2002. It issued its recommendation in November last year, well before the current market slide, and can boast that it got it right more than the other brokers listed. </p> <p>The consensus of market estimates for BT's profits in the next two years is extremely negative; no one expects BT to match last year's profits, with the average of forecasts seeing a slide of one-third to \u00a32,063m. The average forecast for 2002 is even gloomier; profits at BT will dip to \u00a31,475m, 60% below the \u00a33.6bn it rang up at its peak in 1997. But there are optimists. Deutsche Bank issued a \"strong buy\" recommendation on BT shares last month, confident that newly appointed finance director Philip Hampton has a firm grip on the business. Mr Hampton is widely tipped as the likely successor to Sir Peter Bonfield if he is forced out of the chief executive role at BT. </p> <p>\"Philip Hampton made a very encouraging debut at the results presentation demonstrating, in our opinion, a sound financial and operational grasp of the business. The level of disclosure and coherence of delivery improved markedly from what we have become accustomed to in the recent past,\" says Deutsche Bank. </p> <p>However, Deutsche Bank admits that there are several factors which are making it difficult to be too upbeat about BT. \"Whilst we retain our current rating, we acknowledge that in the current climate the sceptics hold the upper hand.\" </p> <p>Deutsche says it is concerned about a steep fall in profitability at Concert, BT's international call joint venture with American telecoms giant AT&amp;T. Concert profits dropped from \u00a360m in the first quarter to \u00a346m in the second quarter and then dived to just \u00a32m in the third quarter. </p> <p>BT is an internationally held stock, so the views of Wall Street investors are as important as UK investment banks. Here there is a glimmer of hope; according to multex.com, a website which carries recommendations from the big Wall Street banks, the consensus view in New York is that BT is \"buy/hold\". </p> <p><strong>'Biggest cash call in trading history'</strong></p> <p>If British Telecom decides to go ahead with a \u00a35bn rights issue, it will be the biggest cash call upon shareholders in stock market history - and mean that millions of small investors will be asked to send cheques to BT. </p> <p>Rights issues are used by stock market-quoted firms to raise money by issuing new shares and giving the shareholder the \"right\" to take them up. New shares are offered in proportion to existing holdings; for example, a \"1 for 3\" rights issue means the shareholder is offered one new share for every three held. </p> <p>But you have to pay for these rights; the price of the shares is fixed, usually at a small discount to the current share price. But in BT's case, the market expects the rights issue to be heavily discounted - for example, the new shares may possibly be issued at 400-450p compared to the current 515/520p share price. If someone has 600 BT shares (the standard allocation at its three-stage privatisation), and the rights are \"1 for 3\", the cost of taking up the rights would be around \u00a3800. </p> <p>There is no obligation on small investors - BT has 1.3m shareholders who own parcels of 800 shares or less - to take up the rights, but if they are ignored, then the result is \"dilution\". Rights issues result in an increase in the total amount of shares in BT, which in turn means that when it comes to dividends, the payment is spread over many more shares, or in effect \"diluted\". Shares not taken up by existing shareholders are sold on the open market by investment banks which underwrite a rights issue.</p>",

Someone who bought the standard allocation of BT shares at all three privatisation \"tranches\" in 1984, 1991 and 1993 and still holds them today is sitting on a tidy profit - they would have cost \u00a31,800 and be worth \u00a33,090 today, according to figures from Barclays Stockbrokers. But they would have been worth \u00a39,000 a year ago, and anybody who has bought BT shares over the past three years and holds them now has probably lost money. The BT share price edged ahead steadily from 1984 to 1997, but then soared as the stockmarket became transfixed by the potential profits from the mobile phone boom. At its peak in late 1999 the stock briefly hit \u00a315, but following this week's dramatic falls on the stock market was trading at around 515p. Its shares have been savaged by investors who wonder if the billions it paid for third-generation mobile phone licences will ever pay off. BT has accumulated a \u00a330bn debt mountain - equal to three-quarters of its stock market valuation - and had hoped to pay some of it back by selling off parts of the business. But the prices it could fetch - if it can find a buyer - are much lower than first predicted because of the sharp stock market downturn of recent months. \"It's pig-stuck with debt and has been slow to react to change. It still gets most of its income from land-lines, which everybody else is trying to get out of,\" says Justin Urquhart Stewart of Barclays Stockbrokers. \"They have got the choice of floating or selling off parts of the business, or going for a rights issue. Either the chairman, Sir Peter Vallance, or the chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield, will have to fall on their swords,\" he says. BT, once regarded as a potential global giant, is now regarded as a bit player on the world stage and has fallen far behind Vodafone in British investors' affections. \"There's no question of BT going bust, but will it exist in its current form in five years' time? It may be that it just becomes the junior partner of another international operation,\" says Mr Urquhart Stewart. So what should small shareholders do now? Sell out, hold on, or even buy more? Nomura, for example, has issued a \"sell\" note, which is based on a forecast that BT's profits will slide from the \u00a33.1bn it reported for 2000 to \u00a32bn in 2001 and only \u00a3459m in 2002. It issued its recommendation in November last year, well before the current market slide, and can boast that it got it right more than the other brokers listed. The consensus of market estimates for BT's profits in the next two years is extremely negative; no one expects BT to match last year's profits, with the average of forecasts seeing a slide of one-third to \u00a32,063m. The average forecast for 2002 is even gloomier; profits at BT will dip to \u00a31,475m, 60% below the \u00a33.6bn it rang up at its peak in 1997. But there are optimists. Deutsche Bank issued a \"strong buy\" recommendation on BT shares last month, confident that newly appointed finance director Philip Hampton has a firm grip on the business. Mr Hampton is widely tipped as the likely successor to Sir Peter Bonfield if he is forced out of the chief executive role at BT. \"Philip Hampton made a very encouraging debut at the results presentation demonstrating, in our opinion, a sound financial and operational grasp of the business. The level of disclosure and coherence of delivery improved markedly from what we have become accustomed to in the recent past,\" says Deutsche Bank. However, Deutsche Bank admits that there are several factors which are making it difficult to be too upbeat about BT. \"Whilst we retain our current rating, we acknowledge that in the current climate the sceptics hold the upper hand.\" Deutsche says it is concerned about a steep fall in profitability at Concert, BT's international call joint venture with American telecoms giant AT&amp;T. Concert profits dropped from \u00a360m in the first quarter to \u00a346m in the second quarter and then dived to just \u00a32m in the third quarter. BT is an internationally held stock, so the views of Wall Street investors are as important as UK investment banks. Here there is a glimmer of hope; according to multex.com, a website which carries recommendations from the big Wall Street banks, the consensus view in New York is that BT is \"buy/hold\". 'Biggest cash call in trading history' If British Telecom decides to go ahead with a \u00a35bn rights issue, it will be the biggest cash call upon shareholders in stock market history - and mean that millions of small investors will be asked to send cheques to BT. Rights issues are used by stock market-quoted firms to raise money by issuing new shares and giving the shareholder the \"right\" to take them up. New shares are offered in proportion to existing holdings; for example, a \"1 for 3\" rights issue means the shareholder is offered one new share for every three held. But you have to pay for these rights; the price of the shares is fixed, usually at a small discount to the current share price. But in BT's case, the market expects the rights issue to be heavily discounted - for example, the new shares may possibly be issued at 400-450p compared to the current 515/520p share price. If someone has 600 BT shares (the standard allocation at its three-stage privatisation), and the rights are \"1 for 3\", the cost of taking up the rights would be around \u00a3800. There is no obligation on small investors - BT has 1.3m shareholders who own parcels of 800 shares or less - to take up the rights, but if they are ignored, then the result is \"dilution\". Rights issues result in an increase in the total amount of shares in BT, which in turn means that when it comes to dividends, the payment is spread over many more shares, or in effect \"diluted\". Shares not taken up by existing shareholders are sold on the open market by investment banks which underwrite a rights issue.",

Anyone forced to retire now, who did not do this, still has some options - income drawdown which defers the annuity or giving up some annuity income by opting for a with-profits annuity which will gain from any future equity uplifts.\" </p>",

But there are no clear rules for the MVA - it is an arbitrary decision by actuaries. \"We call it a market value reduction to reflect what it is,\" says Norwich Union actuary John Lister. \"We are not applying it at the moment and we shall tell policyholders who want to cash in should we do so.\" NU policyholders have seen annual bonuses falling - from 5.75% in 2000 to 5.25% this year in line with share prices. Any MVA will be based on the severity of a bear market and reduced for long term holders. But many bonds allow MVA-free withdrawals - often on the 10th anniversary of purchase, generally on regular withdrawals (only used by around one in five) and always on death. Pensions Stock market falls can be fatal for the retirement ambitions of personal pension holders. Their final pot - and that of employees in money purchase company schemes including additional voluntary contributions - depends on investment performance. \"Those who should really worry are pension buyers retiring this weekend with a very high equity exposure,\" says Tom McPhail at IFA Torquil Clark in Wolverhampton. \"They could have lost 10 to 15% over the past year while annuity rates have basically remained static. They will be worse off. However, most pension funds are conservatively managed with little in the way of high tech or media stocks. \" Few plans are linked 100% to share values - most have other elements such as cash, property or bonds which cushion stock market falls. Pension investors cannot have their money back, but they can change their risk profile. \"It's a customer choice,\" says Colin Ledlie at Standard Life. \"Typically, a holder elects, five years before retirement, to move a fund month by month into a more cautious area - generally bonds to reflect the eventual annuity. Anyone forced to retire now, who did not do this, still has some options - income drawdown which defers the annuity or giving up some annuity income by opting for a with-profits annuity which will gain from any future equity uplifts.\"",

      "body": "<p>Fears that Britain will be as divided in retirement as it is in work were fuelled this week by a survey that revealed the number of company directors who will be paid a pension of more than half a million pounds has more than trebled. </p> <p>Last year, seven company directors in the survey could lay claim to a pension worth more than \u00a3500,000. A further 35 can rely on a pension package that will bring them more than a \u00a3250,000 each year, index linked to the rate of inflation. In 1999 there were only two members of the half a million pound club. </p> <p>Unilever, the maker of Elizabeth Arden cosmetics and Wall's ice cream, provides one of the seven. Bob Phillips, who managed the cosmetics division, left the company last year. He can look forward to \u00a3556,723 in annual pension payments. Drugs giant Glaxo Smithkline is more generous. It is due to give its chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier a pension of \u00a3700,000 and chairman Sir Richard Sykes \u00a3551,000. </p> <p>Yet the survey underestimates the amount of money pouring into boardroom pension schemes and the number of directors who benefit. Only those directors with the largest pension entitlement in each FTSE 100 company are highlighted. Behind them lurk many more. </p> <p>Unilever is a case in point. Niall Fitzgerald, the company's chairman, is also a member of the exclusive club after amassing a pension of \u00a3502,0000 so far. </p> <p>Most directors of large companies enjoy the security of a pension linked to their final salary, known as a defined benefit scheme. They are guaranteed a proportion of their salary as a pension, which means that the sound of crashing stock markets will not keep them awake at night. </p> <p>Employees often have more to fear. Final salary schemes are expensive and directors have been ditching them, if not for themselves, but certainly for the staff. </p> <p>Those companies that have switched from offering final salary schemes to money purchase pensions, which have a defined contribution rather than defined benefit, will have seen their pensions gain little in the past year as stock markets stood still or tumbled. </p> <p>In the last couple of years GlaxoWellcome, media group Reuters and the banks Alliance &amp; Leicester, Halifax, Barclays and HSBC have all closed their final salary schemes to new staff. Employees joining these firms must pay into a money purchase scheme instead. </p> <p>If staff are lucky enough to keep their final salary scheme they will be protected from the vagaries of the markets and will enjoy a better pension than anyone who has missed out. But they usually find themselves playing by a different set of pensions rules to directors. </p> <p>To keep with Inland Revenue rules, companies can offer up to two-thirds of the final salary as pension. Traditionally, workers and directors needed to clock up 40 years out of a nominal 60 in the occupational scheme to get their two-thirds. </p> <p>This rule can be bent and frequently is. What are called pensionable years can be added to your total in order to reach the 40 years target more quickly. Revenue rules allow directors to add pensionable years at a rate of one for every 30 years rather than 60, halving the time it takes to reach the maximum level. Other complex rules allow pensions to leap at a rate unimaginable for an employee. Clive Thompson, the chief executive of cleaning and business services company Rentokil Initial, had accrued a pension of \u00a3406,000 in 1999, according to the company's annual report for that year. By last year, the figure had risen to \u00a3502,000. The 23% jump in pension income is not in line with him adding another pensionable year to his tally. Nor is it justified by any increase in the company's profits, which moved up by 10.3%, or the share price. Since January 1999 Rentokil's share price has more than halved from 460p a share to 204p. </p> <p>Geoff Mulcahy, the boss of B&amp;Q to Superdrug retail business Kingfisher, capitalised on a 15% jump in profits to push his pension entitlement up by 24% from \u00a3440,000 to \u00a3548,000. Shares in the firm dropped by more than a third in the same period. None of the usual measures seems to account for the huge increases in accrued pension income. Even more interestingly, both companies have just reported drops in profits in the last month, along with further falls in their share prices. The effect on directors' pensions, however, will not be known until the latest annual reports appear next month. </p> <p>The government believes that forcing companies to become more transparent about the rules around pay and perks packages will embarrass them into dropping ludicrous schemes that cannot be justified by either rises in share prices or profits. Instead of limits on boardroom excess or increased powers to stakeholders like employees, trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers said this week there will be new disclosure requirements to take effect from later this year. It is not known if pensions will be mentioned, but experts reckon it is unlikely. Shareholders will be the sole judges of excess, and they concentrate their fire on huge share option schemes rather than soaring pensions. </p> <p>Rows this week about executive pay are typical. Matt Barratt, chief executive of Barclays, who could receive \u00a336m if the bank meets certain targets, revealed further jumps in his own income. Most critics, however, focused on the cost of share options offered to Mr Barratt, which directly affect shareholders. </p> <p>So for the moment, the situation is left to drift. Companies are paying their directors enhanced pensions in the good years as part of burgeoning pay and perks packages, while employees in the same scheme rely on clocking up their years of service. In addition, a growing band of employees rely on money purchase schemes. </p> <p>The latest figures from the government actuary's depart ment for 1995 report that 52% of male employees were members of a final salary occupational pension scheme, down from 64% in the mid-1980s. The proportion of women in final salary schemes increased to 39%, but the rise followed a huge influx of women into the labour market in general. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the problems for employees in money purchase schemes are not just about how the slow growth of investments can affect pension payouts. </p> <p>The Association of British Insurers highlights that employers tend to put less money into money purchase schemes. Laurie Edmans, chairman of the association's pensions committee, says employers, on average, will cut their levels of contributions from 15% of salary to 10% after they move from final salary schemes. </p> <p>Life insurers, while they like becoming the pension manager for a company money purchase scheme, are concerned by the overall drop in cash coming from employers into pensions investments. In effect, their own livelihoods are at risk along with the prospective pensioner if more employers dump final salary schemes. </p> <p>Jim Cousins, a prominent backbench Labour MP and member of the Treasury select committee, is deeply concerned about the widening gap between pensions paid out to boardroom directors and employees. He is also disturbed by the uncertainty faced by employees who are only given the option of a money purchase scheme. </p> <p>\"We could be looking at the creation of a pension rich and pension poor. I think it is urgent that we look at the ways employees are treated compared to directors.\" </p> <p>Mr Cousins says that ministers have failed to see the warning signals that shares can go up as well as down. \"I think the government has been extremely naive in respect of the switch from defined benefit schemes to defined contribution. Given the falls in the stock market this week and over the last year, it shows how the payout from defined contribution schemes leaves the employee vulnerable.\" </p> <p> He adds: \"The government has projected the benefits of defined contribution pensions based on the gains of the last 10 years, which I think is a flawed way to approach an assessment of the next 10 years.\" </p> <p>Help the Aged is concerned that the pensions landscape is changing to the detriment of employees. \"It could be that the best days of pension policies in the UK are behind us,\" says Mervyn Kohler, the charity's head of public affairs. </p> <p>He believes the current crop of employees nearing retirement are the real winners in the pensions battle. \"They are doing quite well because many will have final salary pensions and unlike generations before them, the pensions payments have been protected from erosion by inflation. But now it is a pretty scary scenario.\" </p> <p>He points to the way pensions are paid for on the con tinent, which involves a large commitment from the employer. \"On the continent it is expected that employers must put in a decent whack of money to safeguard the pensions of employees. We seem to be going more in the direction of the US where everyone is left to fend for themselves.\" </p> <p>Moderate trade unions such as the electrical and engineering union AEEU say directors should use the same rules as employees when calculating pensions. </p> <p>The union's general secretary, Sir Ken Jackson, says: \"We have never opposed reasonable levels of pay for directors, but there is clearly a problem when one set of principles is used for the board and another for employees.\" </p> <p>Mr Barratt, of Barclays, negotiated a separate pension scheme that accelerated his path towards his two-thirds entitlement, says a spokesman for the bank. BP Amoco also admits that directors will earn their pension credits at twice the speed of employees. </p> <p>According to the survey, conducted annually by Labour Research, early retirement is also governed by a \"one rule for you and another for me\" policy. </p> <p>Ian Strachan, the former chairman of automated controls group Invensys, left the company last year at the age of 56. He received \u00a31.5m compensation for cutting short his contract, \u00a353,970 in other benefits and a pension credit of \u00a364,724, taking his annual pension to \u00a3331,351. Given the large compensation package, it is not surprising he felt he would defer taking his pension until a later date. </p> <p>\u0095 Additional research by Juliet Shedden.</p>",

BP Amoco also admits that directors will earn their pension credits at twice the speed of employees. According to the survey, conducted annually by Labour Research, early retirement is also governed by a \"one rule for you and another for me\" policy. Ian Strachan, the former chairman of automated controls group Invensys, left the company last year at the age of 56. He received \u00a31.5m compensation for cutting short his contract, \u00a353,970 in other benefits and a pension credit of \u00a364,724, taking his annual pension to \u00a3331,351. Given the large compensation package, it is not surprising he felt he would defer taking his pension until a later date. \u0095 Additional research by Juliet Shedden.",

      "body": "<p>Is nothing sacred? Is there no area of memorabilia which the Beatles have not infiltrated and come to dominate prices? I picked up Phillips auction house's catalogue for its sale of cigarette cards and trade cards (ie postcards) of the world this Thursday, and there it was. The number one item was the Beatles set with an asking price of \u00a3130-\u00a3150. </p> <p>Cigarette cards are the little pictures that used to go in a pack of 10 cigarettes produced by G&amp;O Wills, Players and others. They would be a series of sportsmen, soldiers, trains, motorcars and theatrical figures. They were popular before the second world war. They were like an early loyalty card but after the war they were largely discontinued. </p> <p>Now given that the \"Fab Four\" from Liverpool were not even in short trousers at that time, let alone famous, what are they doing on little cards? The answer is bubble gum cards superseded cigarette cards. They were put inside bubble-gum packets from the 1950s onwards and lingered on until the 1970s. This Beatles set was made by A &amp; B.C.Gum. They were cheaper versions of the cigarette card for obvious reasons: bumble gum did not cost as much as cigarettes. </p> <p>Another form of card, which survived the second world war, was the Brooke Bond card, which came with packets of tea. Many of these were for overseas markets, and there are issues of Rhodesian and South African series which had collections of African wildlife on them. The Canadian issues include a set of songbirds of North America. </p> <p>While the cigarette cards seem to have disappeared from view as smoking is frowned upon, and while the bubble gum cards might be deemed inferior, they are both popular among collectors, as are the Brooke Bond cards. According to David Stuckey, the editor and publisher of Card Times: \"Demand for cards is quite strong at the moment.\" His journal has 3,000 subscribers. They are usually male, in their forties, have some disposable income and want to take a trip down memory lane. </p> <p>He says that there is always a premium on anything to do with the Beatles, but adds that you would not pay much less for a set of Elvis cards or even a set of Monkees cards. </p> <p>Individual cards start at around \u00a31 and used to go up to \u00a350 for a set a few years ago. Now a set can easily cost over \u00a3100. Not all cards are equally in demand. There is little call for cigarette cards with flowers or recipes. \"Anything to do with sport is avidly collected,\" says Stuckey. </p> <p>Of the total 442 lots on sale, half are trade cards of the world. The first postcards were introduced in Britain in 1871. Their attraction was not illustration - they were buff coloured - but the price. They cost half a penny to post, while the letter was 1p. By 1890 illustrations were allowed on the cards, and between 1900 and 1918 they enjoyed a golden age. </p> <p>It is these Edwardian cards, and not as is commonly assumed the saucy seaside ones of Donald McGill (1875 to 1962), which are most sought after. McGill lived a long life and was prolific. Many of his cards can be found for \u00a31-\u00a32. </p> <p>Brian Asquith, who is a collector himself and consultant at the Phillips sale, explains: \"Postcards were easily the cheapest and most popular means of communication, at the time. They cost half a penny. You could buy six cards for 3p. There were six or seven collections a day, so you could send one to your butcher in the morning and have your meat delivered by the evening when you got home. A telegram cost one shilling, which was a lot for the ordinary person.\" </p> <p>There was an explosion of all kinds of cards, cards depicting actresses, the countryside and seaside, trains and boats. Asquith says the most popular are topographical, actual photographs of someone with a village background. How much would you pay for these? </p> <p>\"When my wife and I started collecting 20 years ago, you could find individual cards for 10p. Now you would probably start at 50p and can pay upwards of \u00a340 for a card. In some cases you could pay a three-figure sum. One card fetched over \u00a31,000, but that was something from the Titanic. Prices rise steadily year on year.\" </p> <p>Although topographical cards are the most popular, there are exceptions. One of the highlights of the Phillips sale is an unusually large collection of 163 postcards relating to the women's movement. Dating from 1892 to 1917, it features a mix of black and white and colour photographs, illustrations and cartoons. Almost all are humorous and depict a mixture of opinions on the suffragette movement. They are to be sold as one lot and are expected to fetch \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,200, and would sit nicely next to a picture of Sir Paul McCartney - the former Beatle who went on to write the hit song Suffragette for Wings. </p> <p> For further information: Phillips, tel: 020 7629 6602 <a href=\"http://www.phillips-auctions.com;\">www.phillips-auctions.com;</a> Card Times, tel: 01695 423470.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It was too much to expect that the nightmare scenes extending across the countryside could leave the City immune. Yet it took the announcement of cutbacks in the newest industry to usher in some fraction of the horrors afflicting the oldest. Ironically, the slump in shares coincided with excellent job statistics. </p> <p>From its ivory howdah in services, the financial world credits \"top down\" estimates of prosperity above any erosion of the economic base. Farming, fishing and transport disasters can be set aside when modern industries are humming and leisure pursuits proliferating. But as it is recognised that billions are being wiped from the national product by the spate of setbacks, reservations fester. Budgets, from government to households, will need a recount, even if the census and elections can go ahead as planned. Inflation, like employment, is likely to be much less benign before long. </p> <p>A revival in US output and demand is necessary if the rest of the world, particularly Germany and the UK, the third and fourth-largest economies at present unstable exchange rates, are to prosper. Strength in depth, if not self-sufficiency, will be a test of credit-worthiness and future prospects. And small businesses, rather than the international giants that are no longer so prominent in either of the oldest industrial countries, hold the key to economic growth. In Germany, the experience of new investors has been especially daunting of late, with shares on average down by more than 80% in a year on the Neuer Markt, catering for smaller companies and hi-tech start-ups. </p> <p>So far the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) has avoided such a bloodbath, though several initially more successful software and technology companies moved to the main market for its greater liquidity. After a slow start the AIM market has now attracted well over 500 companies and, on average, they have raised more than \u00a310m each, though most are much smaller. This week's setback is unlikely to deter new entrants since tax reliefs for new subscribers and taper down in capital gains tax to 10% four years after a market purchase, provides big incentives. </p> <p>Although such encouragement for venture capitalists is continuing with government publicity and the Myners report favouring more early stage risk investment by pension funds, the pace of subscription for new venture capital trusts (VCTs) has slowed markedly in recent weeks. Nevertheless, funds with a large AIM exposure have usually achieved their target for funds raised, or come within striking distance of it. A wide spread of investments is again seen as attractive. This must also apply to direct investors in AIM shares. One success may easily offset two failures. </p> <p>Investment in smaller companies was rewarding for most of the past two years and after the shakeout hopes of appreciation while interest rates are low and there is plenty of capital available should be realised. Top performers like AIM Trust and Eaglet have come down from their peaks, the latter only recently after large build-ups of stakes in the leisure and technology hardware sectors paid off initially. Reduced liquidity means that some discount on underlying share values is called for. With wider and smaller holdings, Aberforth investment and unit funds have become leaders over the last year and Baillie Gifford has almost held its own, while unit holders on average have lost a fifth of their money in the sector after a year of wild swings.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was too much to expect that the nightmare scenes extending across the countryside could leave the City immune. Yet it took the announcement of cutbacks in the newest industry to usher in some fraction of the horrors afflicting the oldest. Ironically, the slump in shares coincided with excellent job statistics. From its ivory howdah in services, the financial world credits \"top down\" estimates of prosperity above any erosion of the economic base. Farming, fishing and transport disasters can be set aside when modern industries are humming and leisure pursuits proliferating. But as it is recognised that billions are being wiped from the national product by the spate of setbacks, reservations fester. Budgets, from government to households, will need a recount, even if the census and elections can go ahead as planned. Inflation, like employment, is likely to be much less benign before long. A revival in US output and demand is necessary if the rest of the world, particularly Germany and the UK, the third and fourth-largest economies at present unstable exchange rates, are to prosper. Strength in depth, if not self-sufficiency, will be a test of credit-worthiness and future prospects. And small businesses, rather than the international giants that are no longer so prominent in either of the oldest industrial countries, hold the key to economic growth. In Germany, the experience of new investors has been especially daunting of late, with shares on average down by more than 80% in a year on the Neuer Markt, catering for smaller companies and hi-tech start-ups. So far the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) has avoided such a bloodbath, though several initially more successful software and technology companies moved to the main market for its greater liquidity. After a slow start the AIM market has now attracted well over 500 companies and, on average, they have raised more than \u00a310m each, though most are much smaller. This week's setback is unlikely to deter new entrants since tax reliefs for new subscribers and taper down in capital gains tax to 10% four years after a market purchase, provides big incentives. Although such encouragement for venture capitalists is continuing with government publicity and the Myners report favouring more early stage risk investment by pension funds, the pace of subscription for new venture capital trusts (VCTs) has slowed markedly in recent weeks. Nevertheless, funds with a large AIM exposure have usually achieved their target for funds raised, or come within striking distance of it. A wide spread of investments is again seen as attractive. This must also apply to direct investors in AIM shares. One success may easily offset two failures. Investment in smaller companies was rewarding for most of the past two years and after the shakeout hopes of appreciation while interest rates are low and there is plenty of capital available should be realised. Top performers like AIM Trust and Eaglet have come down from their peaks, the latter only recently after large build-ups of stakes in the leisure and technology hardware sectors paid off initially. Reduced liquidity means that some discount on underlying share values is called for. With wider and smaller holdings, Aberforth investment and unit funds have become leaders over the last year and Baillie Gifford has almost held its own, while unit holders on average have lost a fifth of their money in the sector after a year of wild swings.",
