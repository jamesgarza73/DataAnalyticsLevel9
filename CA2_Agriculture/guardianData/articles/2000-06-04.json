      "body": "<p>The hot question with the Blair baby is not who the Godparents will be or will Tony be emptying the nappies in between trips to the dispatch box, but whether the child will be accompanying his mother in to work for the traditional \"Here's one I made earlier\" office lap of honour.</p> <p>Working mothers seem obliged to go through this ritual. Whether truly wanting the litany of fawning praise for the rugrat, or feeling the need to provide a flesh-and-blood sick-note for the time off giving birth, I don't know, but it happens and it happens on a regular basis.</p> <p>The PM (power mum - or career mother as the press likes to dub them) is forced to do a circuit of the company clutching a warbling bundle in her arms and with an industrial-size nurture pack from Mothercare strapped to her back. As she is not known by sight in most of the departments (communication by email alone) she will often be mistaken for a refugee who somehow slipped past security.</p> <p> The problem with the baby visit is - for those of us without children - knowing what to say. We can congratulate colleagues on a done deal, we can commiserate when the market drops or a client turns feral. Commenting on the offspring can leave us speechless, though.</p> <p><strong>A quick survival guide for corporate baby encounters</strong></p> <p><br>\u0095 Learn a script. The good thing about babies is that they have a lot in common. Coming up with something innovative in the way of comment is not recommended. Flatter its appearance. Aim your remarks at the baby to add sincerity, as in \"Hello, beautiful, aren't you gorgeous?\" </p> <p>\u0095 Avoid telling the poor harassed mother who has spend nine months carrying the thing and then suffered hours of agony to give birth to it that it looks just like its father. Pick out features that resemble the maternal side.</p> <p><br>\u0095 The great bonding question to ask the mother is \"Does it sleep through the night?\" Prepare to look surprised/shocked/sympathetic/impressed when you get the answer. <br>\u0095 Always refer to the child \"it\" to avoid gender errors. Never rely on clothes-colour assumptions. Blue may mean a boy or a girl.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Wear a raincoat. Take no notice of the mother's assertion that it is \"Not a sicky baby\". The comment that invariably follows this is \"He/she's never done that before\" as you wipe sick stains off your Armani.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Keep a set of keys handy. Babies love the noise and they act like a rattle. Never allow the baby to take the keys. Phoning a parent to tell them their child may well have swallowed the key to your desk drawer is not the easiest of conversations.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Never offer to pick the child up. If you do, hold it face-away, claiming it will need to keep sight of its mother. Never place it over your shoulder. Sick-on-back-of-suit-stains may go undetected until you get home.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Never bounce the baby playfully as this can trigger projectile vomit.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Support the back of the child's head. The unprepared childless may be shocked to the point of seizure at the impression new-borns can do of having been given a broken neck. <br>\u0095 Never pat the child on the head. This will make its eyes roll like a fruit machine. It will also show you are more at home with dogs than kids.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Never ask: \"What is that rash on its face?\"</p> <p><br>\u0095 Never say \"Funny how all new born babies look like William Hague.\"</p> <p><br>\u0095 Give a gift but do not offer a new baby money as it will eat it.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Give a gift that will last. Small clothes tend to be outgrown before they have even got off the premises. A voucher for Guicci or Dolce &amp; Gabbanna is always acceptable. </p> <p><br>\u0095 Practise the smile you will employ when you study the small bundle of vomit and somebody asks whether you are getting broody. Avoid expressions of horror in response. Phrases like \"Ah yes. If only my womb/Bernard's sperm count wasn't....\" End the sentence in tears. That should shut them up for good. </p> <p> SURVIVING WORKPLACE BLUES Depressed? And why shouldn't you be? Work has always been a good place for negative mood enhancement, a sort of instant check-in clinic for depression and paranoia. Office Melancholy is the new stress, a sort of afterburn for all the hurry sickness that always tends to strike when the deadline panic dies down.</p> <p>O.M. is fighting to get a life outside work and then discovering that you don't have one. It's the angst that develops when your remember your friends are all boring and that hobbies are horrible. It's finally getting home on time to watch EastEnders only to discover that Dirty Den is now forgotten history and even Grant the Grunt has gone awol. </p> <p>O.M.-INDUCERS: * You didn't get that weight off/join that gym for the millennium and you've just realised you're not going to do it by spring, either. * You did a course in assertiveness but you still keep saying yes to all that extra work. * You went shopping on the net but couldn't work out how to buy anything * The sight of all those grinning teenage Internet squillionaires in the paper each day is making you feel like a very old under-achiever. * You read the Madonna quote that: 'Everyone in England seems to be so well-read and cultured' and realised the last book you got through was 'Bridget Jones's Diary.' * You can't get the hang of down-dressing. * You just heard your own message on your voicemail and realised you sound like a dork with a mask on. * Your boss has been on a course in motivating staff and his/her behaviour towards you all is now so nice that you have nothing to moan about over the cup-a-soup. * You lost interest in Posh and Becks but the newspapers didn't. * You somehow lost the ability to deal with small decisions and crises. Replacing the battery in your electric toothbrush is somehow beyond your stretch as is deciding between a skinny or full-fat latte.</p> <p>INSTANT PICK-ME-UPS: * Pay a colleague you hate a sincere-sounding compliment * Watch 'Sex In The City' without prejudice. * Your office is terminally drab. Wear something bright to give your brain a colour-boost * Visit a museum or a sex shop during your lunch break * Stick up the picture of Prince Charles wearing the Rasta hat back to front. Know you're not the only person able to make a complete and utter plonker of yourself in public. * Learn a party trick and perform it at work * De-stress your desk. Spend an hour spring-cleaning it, throwing out all the old papers you never read and even sorting through the garbage beneath it. Untangle the phone wire and create a working pen pot - throw out all the dead biros and only keep the ones you like using. * Book another hour in your diary to do all those jobs you hate that you have been putting off. * Forget about the diet - decide to stick to healthy eating, instead. * Exercise raises your mood. Do some desk-bound ones, like lifting both feet together and holding them a few inches off the ground or pulling your stomach in towards your spine and holding the pose for a few seconds. * Learn a useless skill, like yodelling or Morris dancing. * Record a new voice mail message, doing an impression of Daffy Duck * Empty out all your pockets and spend the cash you find on a lottery ticket * Carry dice with you to make all those unimportant decisions. Or flip a coin. * Ring a client up just to say hello, rather than press for business. * Buy a clockwork toy and let it loose on the office floor * Buy a gateau and share it round the office, even though it's nobody's birthday * Talk face-to-face, rather than using E-mails</p> <p>The hot question with the Blair baby is not who the Godparents will be or will Tony be emptying the nappies in between trips to the dispatch box, but whether the child will be accompanying his mother in to work for the traditional \"Here's one I made earlier\" office lap of honour.</p> <p>Working mothers seem obliged to go through this ritual.

SURVIVING WORKPLACE BLUES Depressed? And why shouldn't you be? Work has always been a good place for negative mood enhancement, a sort of instant check-in clinic for depression and paranoia. Office Melancholy is the new stress, a sort of afterburn for all the hurry sickness that always tends to strike when the deadline panic dies down. O.M. is fighting to get a life outside work and then discovering that you don't have one. It's the angst that develops when your remember your friends are all boring and that hobbies are horrible. It's finally getting home on time to watch EastEnders only to discover that Dirty Den is now forgotten history and even Grant the Grunt has gone awol.

      "bodyText": "Before this test, as ever since he became England captain, Nasser Hussain stressed that his side needed to strive for consistency if they were to climb the international ladder. They were, he said in the Trent Bridge long room last Wednesday, still rated one of the worst sides in the world. But repeating such sentiments can have an opposite effect to that intended. Yesterday, with the euphoria of Lord's long behind them, England's cricket regressed to the sad days of wild, uncontrolled bowling and ragbag fielding, and Zimbabwe, stung by their abject performance in the first test, took advantage. Torrential overnight rain had delayed the start until 1.40pm but the play thereafter was dominated by Zimbabwe's batsmen. From 51 for two overnight the visitors had reached 285 for four by the close, only 89 adrift of England's first-innings 374. The game may be beyond winning for Zimbabwe - Mike Atherton's 14th test century and the rain have seen to that - but they have regained their dignity, whereas it seems that Hussain and the coach Duncan Fletcher have barely started the process of transforming England. The day was a personal triumph for Murray Goodwin, 11 not out at the start, who shortly after 5pm tucked Andy Caddick behind square-leg for the single that brought up the third century of his 19-test career and his second in three Tests, after his 113 against West Indies in Kingston.

However, under the scientific scrutiny of Edinburgh's Napier University which used sophisticated counting techniques, the attendance was calculated to be a maximum of 151,000. Moreover, a Mori poll of those attending found that only 40 per cent (60,400) attended because of hunting, a figure borne out by the Daily Telegraph poll which showed 77 per cent of rural dwellers disapprove of hunting. </p> <p>On the question of lamb predation by foxes, and in the interest of balance, I leave the last word to one of the fathers of modern foxhunting, the Duke of Beaufort, who in his 1888 book, Hunting , wrote, '...the accusation of lamb slaughter, false as it is frequent, has been brought against him (the fox) in every county in England.

Abner Doubleday (believed to be from Oxfordshire) standardised the game earlier in the century, but he certainly did not invent it. The game was previously played to various standards both in North America and Europe. An earlier version, 'International Rules' baseball, is still played on Merseyside and in South Wales and a similar game, known as Town Ball, is played in Massachusetts. </p> <p>In Jane Austen's book Northanger Abbey , on the first page, her heroine is described as being fond of 'cricket and baseball'.

      "body": "<p>This time the Dutch will be practising their penalties. \"Certainly,\" Frank Rijkaard replied with a grin when the question was put to him at his team's training camp in Switzerland at the weekend. \"Everybody in the squad will be practising.\"</p> <p>The Dutch, as we know, usually find a way of beating themselves. Sometimes, as in the World Cup final of 1974, the cause is a fatal belief in their own superiority. And in three of their last four major competitions - the European championships of 1992 and 1996 and the World Cup of 1998 - they paid a heavy price for the assumption that any footballer in a Holland shirt can take a penalty under pressure.</p> <p>So now the great improvisers of European football are leaving nothing to chance. As co-hosts of Euro 2000 they are subject to immense expectations. They have the players, in the form of a squad packed with the superstars of the Liga, Serie A and the Premiership, and they have the history. This time they must make their advantages count or disappoint the vast army of fans currently painting the country orange.</p> <p>\"Expectations are always very high,\" Rijkaard said. \"It means that many people have confidence in our team, and that's a good sign. On the other hand I think there are only small differences between the top teams. We have to be in very good shape and we've got to have the right team spirit and then we have the possibility to do something.\"</p> <p>Behind Rijkaard, who was sitting in a dugout by the side of a pitch at a sports centre on the banks of Lake Geneva, the Dutch players were wandering away at the end of the day's final training session in a state of exhaustion from a series of complicated routines devised to improve their physical conditioning. This week, back in Holland, they will refine their tactics in preparation for their Group D meetings with the Czech Republic, Denmark and France.</p> <p>The weight of history lies heavy on this squad's shoulders. Their training is supervised by Johan Neeskens and Ruud Krol, Rijkaard's assistant coaches, members of the generation of total footballers led by Johan Cruyff who reached two World Cup finals - the second without Cruyff - and, in the colours of Ajax, dominated European club competition in the early 1970s. Rijkaard himself is a symbol of the next generation, that of Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten, with whom he won the 1988 European championship - still Holland's only title - before the trio moved on to Milan.</p> <p>Now Rijkaard, who defined the role of the modern \"holding\" midfield player, is hoping to make a different kind of mark on the international scene. In his first coaching job, at the age of 37, he has the opportunity to guide the present generation of players to their place in history. For some of them, like Dennis Bergkamp and the De Boer brothers, it probably represents a last chance. But after the failures of 1996 and 1998, are they ready to claim immortality?</p> <p>\"I think so,\" Rijkaard said. \"They're experienced and they're at the right age. They've been successful with their club teams. They're good players, wonderful players, and this is a great opportunity for them to be part of Dutch soccer history.\"</p> <p>The players are hardly unaware of the burden. \"We have to win, if we want to be compared with the generations before us,\" Marc Overmars said during a break in training. \"If we want to have something to look back on when we're older, we need victory. So every player is keen to prove it. And the possibilities are there. The mix of talent is great. But it was the same in France in '98. We played well and we didn't make it in the end. So I just want to get through the first round.\"</p> <p>The sense of realism extends throughout the squad. \"What the press and the fans are saying,\" Jaap Stam observed, \"is that, with the team we've got now, we have to win the championship. Everybody knows there's a lot of quality in the team, but that's not a guarantee for winning. Yes, if everything comes together at the right time, then we can go a long way. And I hope that we go into history as well. But we don't think too much about it. We try to concentrate on our own game. We'll do our own thing and we'll see how it goes.\"</p> <p>Many of Holland's biggest footballing disasters have been accompanied by stories of internal dissent. In Euro 96, for instance, the squad was said to have been divided by a line between black and white players. Rijkaard, whose father was among the first Surinam-born players to appear in the Dutch league, seems to have restored a sense of collective endeavour, although with the Dutch one can never quite be sure. \"It's a good squad,\" Stam asserted. \"There's nothing going on. We all mingle and the atmosphere is very good.\"</p> <p>The coach's relative youth, and the fact that he played with or against almost all the members of his squad, is on his side. \"The thing is that he understands how it goes at the real top level,\" Overmars said. \"He knows how you feel. He can look in your eyes and tell if you're not happy.\"</p> <p>After hanging up his boots in the mid-90s Rijkaard took a break from football. He returned in 1998, joining the national squad as an assistant to Guus Hiddink in time for the World Cup campaign, taking over after Holland were eliminated by Brazil's greater efficiency with penalties. He seemed popular enough with the 200 fans who had followed the squad to Switzerland last week, who gave him a warm personal ovation and chanted his name when he trotted out on to the pitch at the Stade Nyonnais. \"He's doing very well,\" Stam said. \"He knows what he wants and what he expects from the players. And he knows what's going on in modern football.\"</p> <p>Having worked under Michels, Cruyff, Sacchi, Capello and Van Gaal during his playing career Rijkaard claims to have been influenced by none of them in particular. \"With every coach you work with, you learn something. Then at the end of your career, when you become a trainer, you take something from every coach that you think is useful for you. So, if you see a bad example, you can do something with it because you want to be different. You want to be yourself. There are coaches with habits you don't like and you tell yourself, I don't want to be like that. But there's no one way to success.\"</p> <p>In his position the first responsibility is to entertain. \"The Dutch public always wants to see a team that is trying to be dominant, trying to play attractive football, and after that, hopefully, a team that is winning. It's normal. The players are used to it because they've been brought up in the Dutch football school.\"</p> <p>But Rijkaard was always a winner and he is concerned to establish a solid base from which the team can construct its attacks. \"The differences between the top teams in Euro 2000 are so minimal that I think you have to be very clever in defence and stop your opponents getting opportunities. Top games like these can be decided in one or two moments. The main thing for us is to have a good organisation, so that we know what to do if we don't have the ball. We have players in attack who are skilful and fast. If we manage not to give away a goal, we can score a goal.\"</p> <p>Stam, who will be alongside Frank de Boer in the middle of a four-man defence, reinforced Rijkaard's words. \"The coach wants to have a solid team, starting at the back, giving nothing away. We've got a lot of players who can decide a game in a split second - we have strong players up front and in midfield who can score goals very easily - so the main thing for the team is to stay solid and not concede any goals, because in every game we play we make chances.\"</p> <p>The price of automatic qualification is the lack of competitive matches leading up to the finals, meaning that Rijkaard's ideas have yet to be tested in genuinely competitive conditions. Although Holland have not lost a match since the World Cup semi-final two years ago, a string of lacklustre performances in friendlies - including 10 consecutive drawn games - did nothing to inspire confidence.</p> <p>\"The results so far haven't been the best,\" said Overmars, \"and we've had a lot of criticism, even the manager. But it doesn't really bother me. I look at it in a positive way. If you win the last 10 matches before the tournament, you might start thinking you're going to win it easily.\"</p> <p>Last night in Lausanne's little Olympic Stadium, in front of a crowd of 7,500, Rijkaard's team beat Poland 3-1 in their final warm-up match before returning to Hoenderloo, their base for the tournament. Playing a 4-1-2-2-1 formation, starting with the veteran Aaron Winter in front of the back four and with Boudewijn Zenden in place of the injured Overmars alongside Bergkamp in support of Patrick Kluivert, they produced plenty of attractive attacking moves while confirming suspicions about the vulnerability at the centre of their defence.</p> <p>Although Stam and Frank de Boer looked worryingly cumbersome as Marcin Zewlakov and Pawel Kryszalowicz cut them open to create four good chances in the opening quarter, the Dutch forwards had already begun to assert themselves when De Boer put them ahead after 28 minutes with a curling left-footed free-kick. Kryszalowicz's equaliser, nine minutes later, came after Edwin van der Sar had beaten away Zewlakov's shot with the defenders slow to respond.</p> <p>The arrival after the interval of Edgar Davids, still recovering from the recent removal of an in-growing toenail but nevertheless displaying the sort of energy more suited to a World Cup final, allowed the Dutch to raise their tempo. And, thanks to the work of two more half-time substitutes, the two goals with which Kluivert won the game were certainly the genuine article. For the first, after 55 minutes, he slid the ball home from Peter van Vossen's beautifully delayed pass. And five minutes later he raced in to meet a low cross from Ronald de Boer with a spectacular header.</p> <p>But once the real thing gets under way, can Rijkaard control the independence and self-confidence for which Dutch footballers are justly renowned? \"The coach respects everybody as an individual,\" Stam said, \"but the players know that when we're on the pitch we have to do it together, not alone. It's true that most Dutch people are very confident. I wouldn't say we are over-confident. We're not saying we're going to win it. But we know we can.\"</p>",

We had Pele staying here, for a major football tournament. Joan Collins has been here several times on her way to one of the islands, as has Elizabeth Taylor. We also had Oliver Reed as a guest, who was no trouble at all. </p> <p><strong> Any unusual requests?</strong> </p> <p>It's part of this job to get difficult requests, and I never really think of them as unusual. When people are staying in a hotel, they expect to be able to pick up the phone and get something, just as they would at home. Everything seems very easy to many of them - some people ask for things and like to be looked after straight away. I have been asked to provide some social escorts and this kind of thing; that can put you in a corner and embarrass you. We give them the paper with the ads and they can make the calls - this is all we can do for them. </p> <p><strong> What about a night out?</strong> </p> <p>When a guest asks for a recommendation for dinner, we always try to understand what exactly he wants. It's important to know what kind of meal they would like to have, how much they would like to pay, and whether or not they would like traditional Greek food. We try to recommend places close to the hotel as getting back by taxi late at night can be a problem. For Greek food, Daphne's in the old part of the city is excellent. There is a lovely garden and usually guitar music playing. Pilpool serves continental food and has an excellent view of the Acropolis, which is something lots of guests ask for. Dionysus is on Lycavitos Hill and has a fantastic view of the city - people travel up on a cable car. There is the open-air theatre of Herodion beneath the Acropolis which hosts international music or ancient plays during the summer. Vanessa Mae played there two days ago. </p> <p><strong> What about a day out?</strong> </p> <p>The city is a show in itself and guests can take in the sights either on an organised bus tour or in a private car. It's a good idea to try going outside the city , maybe to take a drive along the coast to see the Temple of Poseidon. The Acropolis is an obvious place for people to go, as is the National Archaeological Museum. The Cycladic Museum is showing the latest relics excavated during the recent works on the Paris Metro. Away from the museums, people really enjoy wandering around the flea markets and enjoying the atmosphere. </p> <p>Hotel Grande Bretagne: 00 301 331 4444 </p> <p>Cycladic Museum: 00 301 724 9706 </p> <p>Dionysus Restaurant: 00 301 923 3182 </p> <p>Pilpool Restaurant: 00 301 342 3665 </p> <p>Daphne's: 00 301 322 7971 </p>",

      "bodyText": "Any famous guests? Recently several political figures have stayed here, such as the Prime Minister of Belgium and the President of the Czech Republic. We had Pele staying here, for a major football tournament. Joan Collins has been here several times on her way to one of the islands, as has Elizabeth Taylor. We also had Oliver Reed as a guest, who was no trouble at all. Any unusual requests? It's part of this job to get difficult requests, and I never really think of them as unusual. When people are staying in a hotel, they expect to be able to pick up the phone and get something, just as they would at home. Everything seems very easy to many of them - some people ask for things and like to be looked after straight away. I have been asked to provide some social escorts and this kind of thing; that can put you in a corner and embarrass you. We give them the paper with the ads and they can make the calls - this is all we can do for them. What about a night out? When a guest asks for a recommendation for dinner, we always try to understand what exactly he wants. It's important to know what kind of meal they would like to have, how much they would like to pay, and whether or not they would like traditional Greek food. We try to recommend places close to the hotel as getting back by taxi late at night can be a problem. For Greek food, Daphne's in the old part of the city is excellent. There is a lovely garden and usually guitar music playing. Pilpool serves continental food and has an excellent view of the Acropolis, which is something lots of guests ask for. Dionysus is on Lycavitos Hill and has a fantastic view of the city - people travel up on a cable car. There is the open-air theatre of Herodion beneath the Acropolis which hosts international music or ancient plays during the summer. Vanessa Mae played there two days ago. What about a day out? The city is a show in itself and guests can take in the sights either on an organised bus tour or in a private car. It's a good idea to try going outside the city , maybe to take a drive along the coast to see the Temple of Poseidon. The Acropolis is an obvious place for people to go, as is the National Archaeological Museum. The Cycladic Museum is showing the latest relics excavated during the recent works on the Paris Metro. Away from the museums, people really enjoy wandering around the flea markets and enjoying the atmosphere.

      "body": "<p>The most formidable obstacle to holidaying on Greek islands is the choice. There are 1,400 to consider, carelessly scattered throughout the Aegean and Ionian seas, and they are all different. Some offer throbbing night-clubs, others just a few tavernas and isolated beaches. Here we have chosen representatives from each of the major groups (the enchantingly named Cyclades, Sporades, Ionian, Aegean, Saronic Gulf and Dodecanese). The prices are offered as a guideline, but sometimes specific availabilities are highlighted. </p> <p> <strong> 1 Corfu </strong> pop: 40,000 </p> <p>History and literature permeate the second largest Ionian island like its many springs and rivers. Corfu was Homer's 'beautiful and rich' land, and Odysseus's final stop on his way home to Ithaca. Shakespeare is also believed to have set The Tempest on the island and, more recently, Lawrence Durrell made Corfu his home. Two weeks in the high season at the Paloumbi Mansion in the secluded village of Sinarades will cost from \u00a3870 per person, including flights, with Simply Ionian (020 8995 1121). </p> <p> <strong> 2 Paxos </strong> pop: 2,200 </p> <p>This small Ionian island has a captivating landscape of ancient olive groves, farmhouses and olive presses. Thankfully Paxos has escaped mass tourism and is highly recommended by discriminating tour companies. The capital, Gaios, is a crumbling and attractive port. Planos Holidays (01373 836000) operate solely in Paxos and have a varied range of properties. The Villa Violetta sleeps six to eight and enjoys superb views over Lakka Bay. Two weeks during the summer months will cost from \u00a3757 per person, including return flights and car hire. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Lefkas </strong> pop: 21,100 </p> <p>The fourth largest island in the Ionian group has 10 satellite islets. The islanders are proud of their mountainous, but fertile, home and many of the older women wear traditional costume. The last two weeks of August are dominated by the International Festival of Literature and Art. Sunvil Activity Holidays (020 8232 9779) use Nidri on Lefkas as a base for their Greek sailing holidays. The flotillas explore the central Ionian islands, including Ithaca and Cephallonia. Prices start at \u00a31,120 for two weeks aboard a Discovery 3,000 yacht during the high season, and include return flights (from Heathrow). </p> <p> <strong> 4 Kephalonia </strong> pop: 32,500 </p> <p>Louis de Berni\u00e8re's Captain Corelli's Mandolin was set here, among the rugged mountains and abundant wild flowers and herbs of the largest Ionian island. There are package tourists but not as many as on Corfu. Nature lovers should note that the island is also a nesting ground for loggerhead turtles. Tapestry (020 8235 7788) have availability during the mid and high season at the Panorama Apartments in the northern fishing village of Assos. Prices for one week of self-catering accommodation start from \u00a3480 per person and include flights, transfers and a welcome hamper. </p> <p> <strong> 5 Zakynthos </strong> pop: 32,500 </p> <p>Unfortunately the Venetians' name for Zakynthos, 'flower of the orient', is a little misleading these days. Much of the island was insensitively rebuilt after an earthquake in 1953, but Zakynthos has been more seriously blighted by mass tourism along the coastline. However, the beaches are beautiful, and unspoilt areas can be found inland. One place to escape the worst of the crowds is Vassilikos. Two weeks at the Lena Villas in the village starts at \u00a3687 per person (based on four sharing). This is a mid-season price, and includes return flights from Gatwick to Zakynthos and car hire. Call Greek Islands Club on 020 8232 9780. </p> <p> <strong> 6 Spetses </strong> pop: 3,700 </p> <p>The most remote of the Saronic Gulf islands is a favourite with British holiday-makers. Pine-covered Spetses became wealthy through ship-building but is probably best known as the setting for the novel The Magus (author John Fowles taught English on the island in 1950). CV Travel (0870 606 0013) have availability at the Villa Ioanna from 24 June to 8 July. The villa, which sleeps eight, costs \u00a31,535 per week (excluding flights). </p> <p> <strong> 7 Skiathos </strong> pop: 4,100 </p> <p>The island's golden beaches attract hordes of package tourists, especially during August, but people also come for the nightlife. There are quieter areas and walks inland. Summer prices for 14 nights at the family-sized Villa Petraki start at \u00a3719 with Skiathos Travel (020 8940 5157) and include return flights to the island. The villa overlooks Kanapitsa beach, with views across to Skopelos and there is availability for two weeks from 30 June. </p> <p> <strong> 8 Skopelos </strong> pop: 5000 </p> <p>Skopelos is less commercial than Skiathos, but probably not for long. There are two main settlements, the port and the lovely hill village, Glossa, while the south-east coast has many sheltered, pebbled beaches. Travel A La Carte (01635 863030) are offering seven nights self-catering at Liakada Cottage from \u00a3409, departing 30 June. This includes return flights and, since Skopelos does not have an airport, ferry transfers. </p> <p> <strong> 9 Alonissos </strong> pop: 3,000 </p> <p>Alonissos has been discovered by tour companies, but the lack of an airport helps to restrict mass tourism. In 1965 an earthquake destroyed the hilltop capital and inhabitants abandoned their homes. In recent years many of the derelict houses have been bought and restored by British and German expats: Old Alonissos is now a vibrant artist community. The seawater around the island is the cleanest in the Aegean. Two weeks at Villa Eirene with Skiathos Travel (0208 940 5157) during July and September will cost from \u00a3588, including flights. </p> <p> <strong> 10 Skyros </strong> pop: 2,800 </p> <p>The island is some distance from the rest of the the Sporades, and actually feels more like the Cyclades, particularly in the stark, cubist Skyros Town. The south side of the island is almost uninhabited and there are few package tourists. Some people specifically come to recuperate at the Skyros Centre, a holistic health centre, but another key reason to visit is the Skyros Lenten Carnival, Greece's quirkiest festival which involves much dressing-up in goat costume (for the men). Manos Holidays (01273 427 333) are offering a lead-in price of \u00a3464 for two weeks' B &amp; B (plus flights and transfers) at the Skyros Palace Hotel, based on two sharing. </p> <p> <strong> 11 Samos </strong> pop: 32,000 </p> <p>The most southerly of the North-Eastern Aegean islands and the closest to Turkey, Samos also has the most tourists. Expeditions inland reveal unspoilt villages and mountain vistas and an exotic and tropical atmosphere is everywhere, thanks to the floral scents (especially jasmine): orchids are even grown for export. Samos is consequently a popular place for rambling and more demanding mountain treks in the spring and autumn. Prices start at \u00a3577 (including flights but not transfers) for 14 nights' B &amp; B during the high season at the Hotel Aeolis with Filoxenia (01422 375 999). The waterfront hotel boasts a roof-top bar and a swimming pool. </p> <p> <strong> 12 Patmos </strong> pop: 2,660 </p> <p>Orthodox and Western Christians have long made pilgrimages to Patmos because it was here that St John, then living in a cave, wrote the Book of Revelations . Sun worshippers now congregate with the devout on the island. Patmos is quite small and accommodation tends to get booked up very quickly. However, CV Travel (0870 606 0013) have availability for one or two weeks at a large house, Langada, which sleeps eight. The villa costs \u00a32,130 per week (excluding flights), and is set on a hillside, around a courtyard and restored chapel. </p> <p> <strong> 13 Lipsi </strong> pop: 606 </p> <p>The idyllic, laid-back island of Lipsi is just eight miles east of Patmos. There are relatively small numbers of tourists so neither the pretty beaches, such as Platys Gialos, nor the locals are overwhelmed. The port town is the only settlement, and there are actually more goats than people. Laskarina Holidays (01629 822 203), specialising in the less well-known islands, have availability for 14 nights at the one-bedroom Kalypso apartments from 20 July, at \u00a3505 per person. </p> <p> <strong> 14 Kalymnos </strong> pop: 18,200 </p> <p>Although this arid island was previously renowned for its sponge fishing, the demise of that industry has meant that Kalymnos's economy relies upon tourism. However, on New Year's Eve 1995, a local fisherman brought in the catch of the day when he netted a two-metre bronze statue of a woman, believed to be the work of the sculptor Praxiteles in 4BC. Prices for two weeks at Ilias Studios, in the heart of the Panormos resort (which may or may not be an advantage), begin at \u00a3489 in July with Airtours (0800 028 4934). </p> <p> <strong> 15 Kos </strong> pop: 26,400 </p> <p>Kos is a large and fertile island, although sunbeds and parasols have sprouted up all over the sandy beaches. One of the most popular and lively islands, it is definitely one for the youngsters (or the young at heart). Kos Town has two streets, Diakon and Nafklirou, that are wall-to-wall bars, plus three nightclubs. Seven nights at the All Inclusive Kourous Club complex, close to the Mastihari resort, leads in at \u00a3371 per person with Manos Holidays (01273 427 333). The package, as the name suggests, includes everything from flights to those all-important drinks. </p> <p> <strong> 16 Symi </strong> pop: 2,332 </p> <p>Symi has a long tradition of sponge-diving and ship-building, but is now more reliant on daytrippers from nearby Rhodes. It has a scenic, wooded interior and a multitude of small bays and beaches, but suffers from severe water shortages. The Symi International Festival runs through July, August and September with music from all over the world, theatre and Greek dancing. Laskarina (01629 822 203) sponsor two weeks of classical music concerts from 20 August and have availability at the harbourside Kyklameno Studio, for that fortnight, for \u00a3620 per person (inclusive). </p> <p> <strong> 17 Rhodes </strong> pop: 98,000 </p> <p>The number one package tour destination in the Dodecanese, with 300 days of sunshine and an east coast of uninterrupted sandy beaches, is also a beautiful island, with unspoilt villages in the interior foothills. The World Heritage-listed old town of Rhodes City is the largest inhabited medieval town in Europe, with imposing fortifications. The self-contained Miramare resort boasts swimming pools, sports facilities, shops and modern suites. The Best of Greece (01784 492 492) offer two weeks B&amp;B at the resort from \u00a31,194 per person. This includes a direct flight from Gatwick and Rhodes </p> <p> <strong> 18 Karpathos </strong> pop: 5,323 </p> <p>This thin island is bisected by an east-west mountain range. For hundreds of years the north and south parts of the island developed independently - the northern village of Olymbos is of endless fascination to ethnologists for the age-old customs of the villagers. Despite having an airport, Karpathos has not suffered too much from mass tourism. Two weeks at the Blue Sea Hotel in Amopi Bay with Greek Sun Holidays (01732 740 317) costs from \u00a3448 per person in October to \u00a3559 in August (based on two people sharing). The price includes scheduled flights and breakfast. </p> <p> <strong> 19 Crete </strong> pop: 160,000 </p> <p>The largest and most southerly Greek island is arguably the most beautiful too. Three mountain ranges are punctuated by agricultural plateaus and numerous sandy beaches fringe the coast. Scenery aside, the island was also the birthplace of Europe's original advanced civilisation, the Minoan. More recently, however, the island has the dubious honour of playing host to a quarter of Greece's tourists, so much of the north coast is over-built with hotels. Catherine Secker (020 8460 8022) has specialised in Cretan holidays for 22 years and offers several properties on the quiet, rural Akrotiri Peninsula. Two weeks at the secluded Villas Hibiscus costs from \u00a3500 per person (based on four people sharing). Flights (included) depart Gatwick every Tuesday to Chania. </p> <p> <strong> 20 Santorini </strong> pop: 9,500 </p> <p>Santorini is often described as unique and spectacular, and justifiably so. An enormous volcanic eruption around 1650 BC created an astonishing caldera (a submerged crater) at the centre of the island. The volcanic volatility persists today, but tourists flock to the photogenic island. Other side-effects include black sand beaches and rather good wines. A traditional cottage in Finikia is available through CV Travel (0870 606 0013) from 18 July for\u00a31,405 per week.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The most formidable obstacle to holidaying on Greek islands is the choice. There are 1,400 to consider, carelessly scattered throughout the Aegean and Ionian seas, and they are all different. Some offer throbbing night-clubs, others just a few tavernas and isolated beaches. Here we have chosen representatives from each of the major groups (the enchantingly named Cyclades, Sporades, Ionian, Aegean, Saronic Gulf and Dodecanese). The prices are offered as a guideline, but sometimes specific availabilities are highlighted. 1 Corfu pop: 40,000 History and literature permeate the second largest Ionian island like its many springs and rivers. Corfu was Homer's 'beautiful and rich' land, and Odysseus's final stop on his way home to Ithaca. Shakespeare is also believed to have set The Tempest on the island and, more recently, Lawrence Durrell made Corfu his home. Two weeks in the high season at the Paloumbi Mansion in the secluded village of Sinarades will cost from \u00a3870 per person, including flights, with Simply Ionian (020 8995 1121). 2 Paxos pop: 2,200 This small Ionian island has a captivating landscape of ancient olive groves, farmhouses and olive presses. Thankfully Paxos has escaped mass tourism and is highly recommended by discriminating tour companies. The capital, Gaios, is a crumbling and attractive port. Planos Holidays (01373 836000) operate solely in Paxos and have a varied range of properties. The Villa Violetta sleeps six to eight and enjoys superb views over Lakka Bay. Two weeks during the summer months will cost from \u00a3757 per person, including return flights and car hire. 3 Lefkas pop: 21,100 The fourth largest island in the Ionian group has 10 satellite islets. The islanders are proud of their mountainous, but fertile, home and many of the older women wear traditional costume. The last two weeks of August are dominated by the International Festival of Literature and Art. Sunvil Activity Holidays (020 8232 9779) use Nidri on Lefkas as a base for their Greek sailing holidays. The flotillas explore the central Ionian islands, including Ithaca and Cephallonia. Prices start at \u00a31,120 for two weeks aboard a Discovery 3,000 yacht during the high season, and include return flights (from Heathrow). 4 Kephalonia pop: 32,500 Louis de Berni\u00e8re's Captain Corelli's Mandolin was set here, among the rugged mountains and abundant wild flowers and herbs of the largest Ionian island. There are package tourists but not as many as on Corfu. Nature lovers should note that the island is also a nesting ground for loggerhead turtles. Tapestry (020 8235 7788) have availability during the mid and high season at the Panorama Apartments in the northern fishing village of Assos. Prices for one week of self-catering accommodation start from \u00a3480 per person and include flights, transfers and a welcome hamper. 5 Zakynthos pop: 32,500 Unfortunately the Venetians' name for Zakynthos, 'flower of the orient', is a little misleading these days. Much of the island was insensitively rebuilt after an earthquake in 1953, but Zakynthos has been more seriously blighted by mass tourism along the coastline. However, the beaches are beautiful, and unspoilt areas can be found inland. One place to escape the worst of the crowds is Vassilikos. Two weeks at the Lena Villas in the village starts at \u00a3687 per person (based on four sharing). This is a mid-season price, and includes return flights from Gatwick to Zakynthos and car hire. Call Greek Islands Club on 020 8232 9780. 6 Spetses pop: 3,700 The most remote of the Saronic Gulf islands is a favourite with British holiday-makers. Pine-covered Spetses became wealthy through ship-building but is probably best known as the setting for the novel The Magus (author John Fowles taught English on the island in 1950). CV Travel (0870 606 0013) have availability at the Villa Ioanna from 24 June to 8 July. The villa, which sleeps eight, costs \u00a31,535 per week (excluding flights). 7 Skiathos pop: 4,100 The island's golden beaches attract hordes of package tourists, especially during August, but people also come for the nightlife. There are quieter areas and walks inland. Summer prices for 14 nights at the family-sized Villa Petraki start at \u00a3719 with Skiathos Travel (020 8940 5157) and include return flights to the island. The villa overlooks Kanapitsa beach, with views across to Skopelos and there is availability for two weeks from 30 June. 8 Skopelos pop: 5000 Skopelos is less commercial than Skiathos, but probably not for long. There are two main settlements, the port and the lovely hill village, Glossa, while the south-east coast has many sheltered, pebbled beaches. Travel A La Carte (01635 863030) are offering seven nights self-catering at Liakada Cottage from \u00a3409, departing 30 June. This includes return flights and, since Skopelos does not have an airport, ferry transfers. 9 Alonissos pop: 3,000 Alonissos has been discovered by tour companies, but the lack of an airport helps to restrict mass tourism. In 1965 an earthquake destroyed the hilltop capital and inhabitants abandoned their homes. In recent years many of the derelict houses have been bought and restored by British and German expats: Old Alonissos is now a vibrant artist community. The seawater around the island is the cleanest in the Aegean. Two weeks at Villa Eirene with Skiathos Travel (0208 940 5157) during July and September will cost from \u00a3588, including flights. 10 Skyros pop: 2,800 The island is some distance from the rest of the the Sporades, and actually feels more like the Cyclades, particularly in the stark, cubist Skyros Town. The south side of the island is almost uninhabited and there are few package tourists. Some people specifically come to recuperate at the Skyros Centre, a holistic health centre, but another key reason to visit is the Skyros Lenten Carnival, Greece's quirkiest festival which involves much dressing-up in goat costume (for the men). Manos Holidays (01273 427 333) are offering a lead-in price of \u00a3464 for two weeks' B &amp; B (plus flights and transfers) at the Skyros Palace Hotel, based on two sharing. 11 Samos pop: 32,000 The most southerly of the North-Eastern Aegean islands and the closest to Turkey, Samos also has the most tourists. Expeditions inland reveal unspoilt villages and mountain vistas and an exotic and tropical atmosphere is everywhere, thanks to the floral scents (especially jasmine): orchids are even grown for export. Samos is consequently a popular place for rambling and more demanding mountain treks in the spring and autumn. Prices start at \u00a3577 (including flights but not transfers) for 14 nights' B &amp; B during the high season at the Hotel Aeolis with Filoxenia (01422 375 999). The waterfront hotel boasts a roof-top bar and a swimming pool. 12 Patmos pop: 2,660 Orthodox and Western Christians have long made pilgrimages to Patmos because it was here that St John, then living in a cave, wrote the Book of Revelations . Sun worshippers now congregate with the devout on the island. Patmos is quite small and accommodation tends to get booked up very quickly. However, CV Travel (0870 606 0013) have availability for one or two weeks at a large house, Langada, which sleeps eight. The villa costs \u00a32,130 per week (excluding flights), and is set on a hillside, around a courtyard and restored chapel. 13 Lipsi pop: 606 The idyllic, laid-back island of Lipsi is just eight miles east of Patmos. There are relatively small numbers of tourists so neither the pretty beaches, such as Platys Gialos, nor the locals are overwhelmed. The port town is the only settlement, and there are actually more goats than people. Laskarina Holidays (01629 822 203), specialising in the less well-known islands, have availability for 14 nights at the one-bedroom Kalypso apartments from 20 July, at \u00a3505 per person. 14 Kalymnos pop: 18,200 Although this arid island was previously renowned for its sponge fishing, the demise of that industry has meant that Kalymnos's economy relies upon tourism. However, on New Year's Eve 1995, a local fisherman brought in the catch of the day when he netted a two-metre bronze statue of a woman, believed to be the work of the sculptor Praxiteles in 4BC. Prices for two weeks at Ilias Studios, in the heart of the Panormos resort (which may or may not be an advantage), begin at \u00a3489 in July with Airtours (0800 028 4934). 15 Kos pop: 26,400 Kos is a large and fertile island, although sunbeds and parasols have sprouted up all over the sandy beaches. One of the most popular and lively islands, it is definitely one for the youngsters (or the young at heart). Kos Town has two streets, Diakon and Nafklirou, that are wall-to-wall bars, plus three nightclubs. Seven nights at the All Inclusive Kourous Club complex, close to the Mastihari resort, leads in at \u00a3371 per person with Manos Holidays (01273 427 333). The package, as the name suggests, includes everything from flights to those all-important drinks. 16 Symi pop: 2,332 Symi has a long tradition of sponge-diving and ship-building, but is now more reliant on daytrippers from nearby Rhodes. It has a scenic, wooded interior and a multitude of small bays and beaches, but suffers from severe water shortages. The Symi International Festival runs through July, August and September with music from all over the world, theatre and Greek dancing. Laskarina (01629 822 203) sponsor two weeks of classical music concerts from 20 August and have availability at the harbourside Kyklameno Studio, for that fortnight, for \u00a3620 per person (inclusive). 17 Rhodes pop: 98,000 The number one package tour destination in the Dodecanese, with 300 days of sunshine and an east coast of uninterrupted sandy beaches, is also a beautiful island, with unspoilt villages in the interior foothills. The World Heritage-listed old town of Rhodes City is the largest inhabited medieval town in Europe, with imposing fortifications. The self-contained Miramare resort boasts swimming pools, sports facilities, shops and modern suites. The Best of Greece (01784 492 492) offer two weeks B&amp;B at the resort from \u00a31,194 per person. This includes a direct flight from Gatwick and Rhodes 18 Karpathos pop: 5,323 This thin island is bisected by an east-west mountain range. For hundreds of years the north and south parts of the island developed independently - the northern village of Olymbos is of endless fascination to ethnologists for the age-old customs of the villagers. Despite having an airport, Karpathos has not suffered too much from mass tourism. Two weeks at the Blue Sea Hotel in Amopi Bay with Greek Sun Holidays (01732 740 317) costs from \u00a3448 per person in October to \u00a3559 in August (based on two people sharing). The price includes scheduled flights and breakfast. 19 Crete pop: 160,000 The largest and most southerly Greek island is arguably the most beautiful too. Three mountain ranges are punctuated by agricultural plateaus and numerous sandy beaches fringe the coast. Scenery aside, the island was also the birthplace of Europe's original advanced civilisation, the Minoan. More recently, however, the island has the dubious honour of playing host to a quarter of Greece's tourists, so much of the north coast is over-built with hotels. Catherine Secker (020 8460 8022) has specialised in Cretan holidays for 22 years and offers several properties on the quiet, rural Akrotiri Peninsula. Two weeks at the secluded Villas Hibiscus costs from \u00a3500 per person (based on four people sharing). Flights (included) depart Gatwick every Tuesday to Chania. 20 Santorini pop: 9,500 Santorini is often described as unique and spectacular, and justifiably so. An enormous volcanic eruption around 1650 BC created an astonishing caldera (a submerged crater) at the centre of the island. The volcanic volatility persists today, but tourists flock to the photogenic island. Other side-effects include black sand beaches and rather good wines. A traditional cottage in Finikia is available through CV Travel (0870 606 0013) from 18 July for\u00a31,405 per week.",

      "body": "<p>Overland to Istanbul </p> <p> An overland journey from Cairo to Istanbul via Jordan and Syria is now available at a 25 per cent discount from Dragoman. The four-week tour, departing from Cairo on 3 July, focuses on the Middle East's most important historical sites, including the Roman city of Jerash, the remains of Nabatean Petra dating from the third century BC and the twelfth-century crusader castle Krak des Chevaliers. Dragoman's use of their own rough-terrain Mercedes Benz vehicles mean that connections are never a problem and every need is taken care of with its onboard fridge, library and the services of a two-person crew. The tour costs \u00a3520 plus a kitty of \u00a3180. The price includes transport, camping, hotel accommodation, all camp meals, but not flights which must be booked separately. Phone 01728 861 133. </p> <p> Cruising a Broad </p> <p> Cruising holidays usually bring to mind opulent scenes on the Mediterranean or the Aegean, but it can also mean lazy days on the Norfolk Broads. Blakes Boating offers vessels that sleep from two to 10 people and promises that no expertise is needed to sail them.

      "bodyText": "Overland to Istanbul An overland journey from Cairo to Istanbul via Jordan and Syria is now available at a 25 per cent discount from Dragoman. The four-week tour, departing from Cairo on 3 July, focuses on the Middle East's most important historical sites, including the Roman city of Jerash, the remains of Nabatean Petra dating from the third century BC and the twelfth-century crusader castle Krak des Chevaliers. Dragoman's use of their own rough-terrain Mercedes Benz vehicles mean that connections are never a problem and every need is taken care of with its onboard fridge, library and the services of a two-person crew. The tour costs \u00a3520 plus a kitty of \u00a3180. The price includes transport, camping, hotel accommodation, all camp meals, but not flights which must be booked separately. Phone 01728 861 133. Cruising a Broad Cruising holidays usually bring to mind opulent scenes on the Mediterranean or the Aegean, but it can also mean lazy days on the Norfolk Broads.

      "body": "<p>'It is, of course, a dream.' The professorial-looking German tour guide standing near the prow of the Flying Dolphin hydrofoil to Patmos is gazing intently at the Cubist jumble of whitewashed houses gleaming in the sunshine on the distant island mountaintop. He is leading a tour of middle-aged Germans on a millennial tour via Chios (Homer), and Samos (Pythagoras), and all around us are the inspiring waters of the Aegean, the nautical thoroughfare of classical Greece. </p> <p>'This is where all the big ideas are, jah?' I try to respond to his conversation with cunning references to the Iliad and the square of the hypotenuse, but he's not really interested. Patmos, home of St John the Divine, is the one he cares about. 'I have been here four, five, six times, but for me it is always the thing I am looking forward to. St John, you know, was imprisoned here. I wish I am being so lucky.' </p> <p>Patmos ('the island of the revelation') is a dream in another sense, too. It offers the Greek Island Experience (limpid water, unspoilt beaches, vagrant goat herds, etc etc) in an almost pre-tourist form. Although at the height of the summer season its main port, Skala, plays host to a procession of cruise ships disgorging busloads of package trip visitors on a whistle-stop tour of the holy sites, Patmos has managed to retain some independence and dignity. It also sustains a certain measure of cool, offering an occasional refuge for stars such as Richard Gere, David Bowie and Madonna, and minor royalty. </p> <p>Skala lies at the centre of the island, guarding the narrow isthmus that links the northern and southern peninsulas. People say that Patmos resembles a Greek Omega, but I couldn't see it. Perhaps just as fancifully, it describes the quirky curves of a seahorse, and measures, from north to south no more than about 12 miles. An energetic visitor can see it all in 48 hours. </p> <p>Another part of the island's charm, and perhaps the key to its character, is its remoteness. Piraeus, the port of Athens, is nearly 200 miles away, or 12 hours sailing on one of the converted cross-Channel steamers that ply the Aegean in the hectic summer months. Alternatively, you can fly to Samos, or to Kos, and take a Flying Dolphin, a resprayed hydrofoil from the Soviet Union. Either way, Patmos is too much of a trek for the wet T-shirt brigade. </p> <p>Which is just as well, because the island has a history that goes back to the day Zeus gave it to his daughter Artemis as a birthday present. Another legend, which is weirdly available in the Monastery of St John the Divine, says that Orestes, pursued by the Furies for the murder of his mother, took refuge here, and built the temple of Artemis. Pagan, or Orthodox Christian, Patmos is steeped in some consoling myths. </p> <p>The biggest of these, of course, is the story of St John. In Protestant Christianity, he is St John the Divine, and quite distinct from the author of the gospels, as if the mind that could come up with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and all that stuff about Armageddon and Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth was simply too outrageously exotic to share a credit with the author of the fourth gospel. The Greeks will have none of this. To them, he is St John the Evangelist, the disciple who in AD95 was banished here by the Emperor Domitian. </p> <p>The exiled John became the island's teacher, and brought the people of Patmos to Christ. He himself lived a simple, spiritual existence in a cave overlooking the sea. It was here that he heard 'a great voice, as of a trumpet', and saw a figure 'like unto the son of man' who instructed him to set down the apocalyptic vision known as The Book of Revelations. </p> <p>Say what you like about 'I saw a new heaven and a new earth' as theology, in tourist terms, it was a masterstroke. Overnight, Patmos became the Mount Sinai of Greece and, after the Temple in Jerusalem, one of the holiest sites in the Christian world. Pilgrims, sacred and profane, have been com ing here ever since. The 'Sacred Cavern', a natural opening in the elephant-grey rock of the hillside, is now cluttered with the tatty, iconographic paraphernalia peculiar to religious shrines, and lies midway between the port of Skala and the hilltop town of Hora. It remains the focus of every tourist visit, and some, like the German on the hydrofoil, can't get enough of it. </p> <p>In the 'sacred cave', according to the Patmos guidebook, 'a person's ego melts into the essence of God and merges with Him and with the soul of the great Seer hovering inside the Cavern. He can almost hear Almighty God saying, \"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end\"...' </p> <p>Well, maybe. Today, you are more likely to hear a Greek-American teenager from Detroit complaining that her mobile phone has lost its signal. Greece, in the years since the dark days of the Colonels, has become transformed by international tourism. Swimming pools, air-conditioning units, airstrips, the onyx and marble Athens underground, and Captain Corelli's Mandolin have all played their part in the modernisation of the land of the Hellenes. </p> <p>Capitalism has inevitably brought corruption, and not even the monks of the Monastery of St John have been able to escape the lure of Mammon. The monastery's former abbot, Bishop Isodoros of Tralleon, is one of four monks who now face criminal indictments for embezzlement on a colossal scale (as much as \u00a3500 million, according to some reports). These charges have inevitably been accompanied by lurid and hard-to-prove stories of under-the-cassock impropriety, both sexual and financial. </p> <p>Despite this, Patmos offers a society which, behind the garish facade of globalisation, seems closer to the world of St John than St Dow Jones. On Patmos, for instance, once you get away from downtown Skala - two minutes on a moped - you are in a world of whitewashed domatia and remote, shingly beaches with quiet, secluded coves. This is the Aegean paradise to which so many want to escape. </p> <p>Escape. Patmos seems to embody the word. Almost everyone I met or spoke with seemed to be playing truant from their lives in some way. There were the various delightful representatives of Laskarina Holidays, each of whom had in different ways turned their backs on the rat-race and suburban normality. There was Mrs Scoutari, the formidable proprietor of the island's premier luxury hotel, the Scoutari, who told me that it was the 'Greek way' to 'live in the present'. There was Theodora 'Doris', the Greek Australian who came to Patmos for love, and now runs a harbourside gift shop. Her dream, she said, was 'to retire to Australia'. </p> <p>And then there was Wayne, the refugee from Canvey Island. I found him in George's Place, the beachside taverna in which he has worked for several years (he is also a partner in the business). An ex-merchant seaman, he had come to Patmos in the Seventies on a whim, fallen in love with the place, become a 'beach bum' and devoted himself to the stone-by-stone construction of a mountain-top eyrie that has become, in Patmos circles, a byword for English eccentricity. He acknowledges the escapism, but is unabashed about his motives: 'Everyone has their reasons for being here.' Wayne is a loner ('I like the solitude'), and Patmos is an island for loners. </p> <p><strong> Looking down on Patmos from Wayne's</strong> roof, it's obvious that another part of the island's appeal is its size and the profound sense that it conveys of centuries of religious settlement. On many hilltops, and in many secret rocky valleys, you find tiny whitewashed churches and chapels, the legacy of the Patmian tradition of consecrating shrines to the memory of loved ones. </p> <p>The ultimate Patmos shrine, of course, is the monastery at the top of the hill in Hora. On my last night I climbed the darkened, blustery steps to observe the name-day Vigil for the island's saint. The tiny chapel of Christodoulous contains some incredibly sacred treasures, including the skull of Doubting Thomas, which is about as good as you get in the relic business. Inside, lit by guttering candles, enacting a scene that could have been a hundred, even a thousand years old, the monks of the monastery were lost in a monotonous, hypnotic chanting, a kind of ecclesiastical jazz that would continue, I was assured, until the small hours. The air was clogged with incense and the smoke of tallow. The shadowy Coptic faces of the monks glowed in the yellow religious gloom like icons. While it's not what most people go to the Greek islands for, it does add another dimension to the experience. </p> <p>\u0095 Robert McCrum travelled to Patmos with Laskarina (01629 822203).

The minimum wage is set at barely above subsistence level. The social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty is adopted in part. Most recently, the ancient universities are excoriated for giving preference to applicants from public schools, but Eton and Harrow are allowed to keep their charitable status and therefore enjoy what amounts to a tax subsidy. </p> <p>Cynics will say that the juggling of favours is part of New Labour's preoccupation with public relations.

Harvard continues to take the question of diversity very seriously. About half of its 6,500 undergraduates receive at least some financial aid from Harvard, with the average award running at $18,000.

But there are a few things you should know. </p> <p>Let's begin with the thing you cannot know, because the university's Office of Public Affairs has decided not to tell you. There are no figures for the number of students who come from private schools and the number who come from state schools. Neither is there a breakdown that might tell you how many students come from suburban schools (for which read middle class) and how many come from inner cities.

In a very real way, it is what makes US private higher education possible. If Harvard stands out from the crowd, it is because no other institution can match its game. Here, as elsewhere, the system depends on the rules remaining somewhat shadowy. The line you will get from the admissions people is that 'all things being equal,' a parent who is a Harvard graduate can be a 'factor.' But the message we graduates get from the fund-raising department is rather different. </p> <p>A word on 'all things being equal'. There were more applicants this year who scored perfect marks on their standardised maths or verbal aptitude tests than there were available places. As a rule, people just don't bother to apply to Harvard unless they're in the very top percentiles. They also do not apply unless they are willing to contribute their own earnings and their families are willing to take out large loans on their behalf. </p> <p>This means that the pool of candidates is largely a middle-class pool, in which most things are already pretty equal. As one old classmate puts it: 'It is common knowledge among North American Harvard alumni that having one or more Harvard parents in your gene pool is an enormous help.' </p> <p>Granted, this complacency is dented almost annually by scare stories about very giving captains of industry who fail to get their children past the post.

What will their class gift add up to? I wonder. Will they be able to top my class, the class of 1974? Just this time last year, we gave $14 million. Well, I suppose I should be honest. They, the 50 per cent who earn more than $200,000, were the ones who gave most of it. When I canvassed my old scholarship friends, I couldn't find a single one who had given more than $100. But even the scholarship students who had made good in Wall Street had not come near to matching the ones who had been born into the sorts of families that have made Harvard what it is. </p> <p>Boys and girls from these backgrounds give double value - not only do they pay their own way; as generous alumnae, they go on to pay everyone else's, too.

      "body": "<p>When you wake on Thursday 5 October next, you will find yourself living in a different country. An ancient bulwark of English law - the principle that someone is presumed innocent until proven guilty - will have been overturned. And that is just for starters. From that date also the police and security services will enjoy sweeping powers to snoop on your email traffic and web use without let or hindrance from the Commissioner for Data Protection. </p> <p>Every UK internet service provider (ISP) will have to install a black box which monitors all the data-traffic passing through its computers, hard-wired to a special centre currently being installed in MI5's London headquarters. This new mass surveillance facility is called the Government Technical Assistance Centre (GTAC). Who said Jack Straw had no sense of humour? </p> <p>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Bill which is now before the Lords gives the Home Secretary powers of interception and surveillance which would be the envy of the most draconian regime. In addition to encroaching on civil liberties, the same Bill will also drive hordes of e-commerce companies from Britain to countries like Ireland where their encryption keys - extended pin numbers allowing users to decipher jumbled data - will be protected from government prying. An administration which complains continually about making Britain 'the most e-friendly country in the world' by 2002 is busily making sure that exactly the opposite happens. </p> <p>How has this extraordinary state of affairs come about? Is it another manifestation of the cock-up theory of history, or are there more sinister forces at work? The answer is a bit of both. For some time, it has been obvious to Ministers and civil servants that British law needed updating to cope with the internet. In an era when online trading becomes ubiquitous, for example, some way has to be found of making 'digital signatures' legally valid. Accordingly, a special Cabinet Office unit headed by Professor Jim Norton set to work to devise a new legislative framework for the emerging world of e-commerce and online communications. The main result of his labour was the Electronic Commerce Bill. </p> <p>As that Bill went through its Parliamentary hoops, it became clear that some parts of it - mainly the sections dealing with data encryption, interception and surveillance - were so deeply flawed that they threatened to sink the Bill. Given the Government's desire to make headway on the e-commerce front, the problematic sections were eventually jettisoned and the Electronic Commerce Bill became law in 1999. </p> <p>It was a smart decision, but it left unresolved the problem of what to do about the encryption stuff. The DTI, smarting from its bruising at the hands of the computer scientists who had comprehensively shredded the original encryption proposals, wanted nothing more to do with it. Accordingly the poisoned chalice passed to the Home Office, which knows little of business and even less about the internet, but is endlessly attentive to the needs of the police, the security services and the Byzantine imperatives of official secrecy. The RIP Bill is the fruit of that secretive bureaucratic milieu. </p> <p>The official rationale for the legislation is that it is required to bring UK law into conformance with the European Convention on Human Rights. In the end, this will have to be tested in the courts, but Straw's confidence is not shared by the Commons Trade &amp; Industry Select Committee which last October recommended that the Government publish a detailed analysis to substantiate its confidence that the Bill does not contravene the Convention. This the Government has so far declined to do. </p> <p>The Bill has four main parts. The first deals with the interception of communications. the second covers 'surveillance and covert human intelligence sources'. The third tackles encryption and the fourth covers the 'scrutiny of investigatory powers and of the functions of the intelligence services'. Parts I to III propose massive extensions of the state's powers to spy on its citizens while the fourth suggests a regulatory regime which seems laughably inadequate to anyone familiar with internet technology. All sections of the Bill have been heavily criticised by external experts and a small number of committed MPs, but the legislation has passed through its Commons scrutiny with its central provisions intact. </p> <p>Part I gives the Home Secretary the power to issue a warrant requiring ISPs to intercept the communications of one or more of their subscribers. The problem is that the internet is not like the telephone system - where it is technically feasible to tap into a particular individual's communications link. In order to monitor a person's internet traffic, you have to tap into all the traffic running through his or her ISP. As a result, the expectation is that Part I of the Bill will be implemented using so-called 'passive monitoring': ISPs will be required to install a 'black box' which will monitor all their data traffic and pass it to the GTAC centre. </p> <p>The news that henceforth all UK internet traffic will find its way to MI5 does not seem to have yet reached MPs, most of whom don't understand the technology and assume that the Home Office must know what it is doing. Defenders of the Bill point out that MI5 can only legally read the content of communications for which specific warrants exist, which is true. But they fail to notice that the Bill affords no such protection to the pattern of one's internet connections. </p> <p>In other words, while MI5 may need a warrant actually to read your email, many other people will have essentially unregulated access to logs of the websites you access, the pages you download, the addresses of those with whom you exchange email, the discussion groups to which you belong and the chat rooms you frequent - in short, a comprehensive record of what you do online and with whom. It will be interesting to see how this squares with the European Convention's requirements about privacy. </p> <p>It is Part III of the Bill, however, which is most likely to contravene the Convention. Section 46 gives the Home Secretary the power to compel the surrender of keys used to encrypt communications data. Failure to comply carries a prison sentence of two years. If someone cannot comply because they have lost or forgotten the key then they have to prove that to the satisfaction of a court. In other words, the burden of proof is shifted from the prosecution to the defence - one is presumed guilty until proved innocent. And how do you prove that you have forgotten something? </p> <p>Even more oppressive is the Bill's creation of a secondary offence - revealing that you have been required to supply, or supplied, a decryption key - which carries an even stiffer penalty. Under the terms of the Bill, for example, the police could arrive at 4am and demand that you produce such a key. If you were unable to comply and were taken in for questioning, it would be a criminal offence punishable by five years' imprisonment to explain to your family why you were being dragged off. </p> <p>Civil liberties campaigners are predictably opposed to the RIP Bill. But it is also widely opposed by the business community. Even Professor Norton, the architect of the Government's e-commerce legislation, describes the proposals as 'a classic own goal' that will undermine the aim of making Britain a centre for e-commerce. Encryption is central to e-business, and many companies have contractual agreements with clients for whom they hold cryptographic keys. Under the RIP Bill they would be banned from revealing that they had surrendered a key and thereby compromised the client's security. </p> <p>'This is a clear case,' says Norton, 'of the futility of government treating internet policy as a national issue when what is needed is international agreement. A UK firm which handed over the key of a multinational client would be vulnerable to a compensation claim in an overseas court for compromising that client's global security. US businesses are not happy about that liability and will opt to work in countries like Ireland.' </p> <p>The most astonishing thing about . Straw's pre-emptive strike on civil liberties and e-commerce is that, to date, there has been almost no public discussion of it. The Ministers driving his Bill through Parliament concede that the powers they seek are sweeping, but argue that they can be trusted to apply them reasonably and that in any case the powers are commensurate with the threat from online criminals, terrorists, paedophiles and pornographers. In the absence of proper safeguards, the first argument is absurd. </p> <p>As far as the second is concerned, nobody has yet produced any convincing empirical evidence that the supposed threats are more than the fantasies of security services and hysterical projections of some newspapers. The internet undoubtedly provides a conduit for criminal conversations and porno graphic transactions. But then so does the telephone system and the Royal Mail, and yet nobody proposes tapping every phone in the land or scanning every letter. A terrifying erosion in our liberties is being planned, yet the threat is largely ignored. </p> <p>Could it be that this collective passivity is because, for most citizens, the liberties that are being eroded lie in the future rather than the present? Most people do not currently encrypt their email, even though an unencrypted email is as vulnerable to snooping as an ordinary postcard. But in five years' encryption will have become a necessity. </p> <p>Human nature being what it is, people will lose or forget their decryption keys - and some will find themselves attempting to convince a judge that they are not paedophiles feigning amnesia to qualify for a shorter sentence. Will they then remember Burke's warning that for evil to triumph it is necessary only for good men to do nothing? And will they wonder why they had not been more alarmed on the morning of 5 October 2000? </p> <p><strong>Rest of the world</strong></p> <p> Most countries impose no restrictions on the use of encryption by their citizens. The exceptions tend to be authoritarian regimes such as those in Russia and China. </p> <p>IRELAND: New e-commerce Bill makes it illegal for government to access commercial cryptographic keys. </p> <p>FRANCE: The government has recently announced a new policy of totally relaxing controls on domestic use of encryption. </p> <p>US: No domestic controls on use of cryptography, though Washington looks enviously at the UK RIP bill. </p> <p>GERMANY: Has long been the European leader in opposing restrictions on citizens' use of encryption.</p> <p>Over the coming weeks The Observer will print a series of articles and opinion pieces on the proposed RIP Bill.

Accordingly the poisoned chalice passed to the Home Office, which knows little of business and even less about the internet, but is endlessly attentive to the needs of the police, the security services and the Byzantine imperatives of official secrecy. The RIP Bill is the fruit of that secretive bureaucratic milieu. The official rationale for the legislation is that it is required to bring UK law into conformance with the European Convention on Human Rights. In the end, this will have to be tested in the courts, but Straw's confidence is not shared by the Commons Trade &amp; Industry Select Committee which last October recommended that the Government publish a detailed analysis to substantiate its confidence that the Bill does not contravene the Convention. This the Government has so far declined to do. The Bill has four main parts. The first deals with the interception of communications. the second covers 'surveillance and covert human intelligence sources'. The third tackles encryption and the fourth covers the 'scrutiny of investigatory powers and of the functions of the intelligence services'. Parts I to III propose massive extensions of the state's powers to spy on its citizens while the fourth suggests a regulatory regime which seems laughably inadequate to anyone familiar with internet technology. All sections of the Bill have been heavily criticised by external experts and a small number of committed MPs, but the legislation has passed through its Commons scrutiny with its central provisions intact. Part I gives the Home Secretary the power to issue a warrant requiring ISPs to intercept the communications of one or more of their subscribers. The problem is that the internet is not like the telephone system - where it is technically feasible to tap into a particular individual's communications link. In order to monitor a person's internet traffic, you have to tap into all the traffic running through his or her ISP. As a result, the expectation is that Part I of the Bill will be implemented using so-called 'passive monitoring': ISPs will be required to install a 'black box' which will monitor all their data traffic and pass it to the GTAC centre. The news that henceforth all UK internet traffic will find its way to MI5 does not seem to have yet reached MPs, most of whom don't understand the technology and assume that the Home Office must know what it is doing. Defenders of the Bill point out that MI5 can only legally read the content of communications for which specific warrants exist, which is true. But they fail to notice that the Bill affords no such protection to the pattern of one's internet connections. In other words, while MI5 may need a warrant actually to read your email, many other people will have essentially unregulated access to logs of the websites you access, the pages you download, the addresses of those with whom you exchange email, the discussion groups to which you belong and the chat rooms you frequent - in short, a comprehensive record of what you do online and with whom. It will be interesting to see how this squares with the European Convention's requirements about privacy. It is Part III of the Bill, however, which is most likely to contravene the Convention. Section 46 gives the Home Secretary the power to compel the surrender of keys used to encrypt communications data. Failure to comply carries a prison sentence of two years. If someone cannot comply because they have lost or forgotten the key then they have to prove that to the satisfaction of a court. In other words, the burden of proof is shifted from the prosecution to the defence - one is presumed guilty until proved innocent. And how do you prove that you have forgotten something? Even more oppressive is the Bill's creation of a secondary offence - revealing that you have been required to supply, or supplied, a decryption key - which carries an even stiffer penalty. Under the terms of the Bill, for example, the police could arrive at 4am and demand that you produce such a key. If you were unable to comply and were taken in for questioning, it would be a criminal offence punishable by five years' imprisonment to explain to your family why you were being dragged off. Civil liberties campaigners are predictably opposed to the RIP Bill. But it is also widely opposed by the business community. Even Professor Norton, the architect of the Government's e-commerce legislation, describes the proposals as 'a classic own goal' that will undermine the aim of making Britain a centre for e-commerce. Encryption is central to e-business, and many companies have contractual agreements with clients for whom they hold cryptographic keys. Under the RIP Bill they would be banned from revealing that they had surrendered a key and thereby compromised the client's security. 'This is a clear case,' says Norton, 'of the futility of government treating internet policy as a national issue when what is needed is international agreement. A UK firm which handed over the key of a multinational client would be vulnerable to a compensation claim in an overseas court for compromising that client's global security. US businesses are not happy about that liability and will opt to work in countries like Ireland.' The most astonishing thing about . Straw's pre-emptive strike on civil liberties and e-commerce is that, to date, there has been almost no public discussion of it. The Ministers driving his Bill through Parliament concede that the powers they seek are sweeping, but argue that they can be trusted to apply them reasonably and that in any case the powers are commensurate with the threat from online criminals, terrorists, paedophiles and pornographers. In the absence of proper safeguards, the first argument is absurd. As far as the second is concerned, nobody has yet produced any convincing empirical evidence that the supposed threats are more than the fantasies of security services and hysterical projections of some newspapers. The internet undoubtedly provides a conduit for criminal conversations and porno graphic transactions. But then so does the telephone system and the Royal Mail, and yet nobody proposes tapping every phone in the land or scanning every letter. A terrifying erosion in our liberties is being planned, yet the threat is largely ignored. Could it be that this collective passivity is because, for most citizens, the liberties that are being eroded lie in the future rather than the present? Most people do not currently encrypt their email, even though an unencrypted email is as vulnerable to snooping as an ordinary postcard. But in five years' encryption will have become a necessity. Human nature being what it is, people will lose or forget their decryption keys - and some will find themselves attempting to convince a judge that they are not paedophiles feigning amnesia to qualify for a shorter sentence. Will they then remember Burke's warning that for evil to triumph it is necessary only for good men to do nothing? And will they wonder why they had not been more alarmed on the morning of 5 October 2000? Rest of the world Most countries impose no restrictions on the use of encryption by their citizens. The exceptions tend to be authoritarian regimes such as those in Russia and China. IRELAND: New e-commerce Bill makes it illegal for government to access commercial cryptographic keys. FRANCE: The government has recently announced a new policy of totally relaxing controls on domestic use of encryption. US: No domestic controls on use of cryptography, though Washington looks enviously at the UK RIP bill. GERMANY: Has long been the European leader in opposing restrictions on citizens' use of encryption. Over the coming weeks The Observer will print a series of articles and opinion pieces on the proposed RIP Bill. If you wish to voice your opinion online you can do so here.

Few rated Slovenia's chances in blizzard conditions when Ukraine took the lead in the second leg, but these boys are used to snow, and Miran Pavlin managed an historic equaliser. </p> <p><strong> How do you beat them?</strong> Arrange for it not to snow. Play on large, well-watered pitches in high-tec stadiums full of partisan supporters. </p> <p><strong> What's their manager like?</strong> Srecko Katanec, a former Stuttgart and Sampdoria player who was the only Slovene in the last united Yugoslavia squad at Italia 90.

      "bodyText": "How did they qualify? By beating Ukraine in a two-legged play-off, which considering England would have gone weak at the knees at the prospect of travelling to Kiev in the snow must rank as one of the outstanding qualification achievements of the tournament. Why haven't we heard of Slovenian football before? Independent of Yugoslavia only since 1991, Slovenia failed to qualify for Euro 96 but have reached these finals at just the second time of asking. Even so its population of two million still largely prefers skiing and basketball. Tournament record There isn't one. How do they beat you? Well, in the case of Ukraine, a lob from the halfway line by Milenko Acimovic late in the home leg provided the crucial advantage to defend in Kiev. Few rated Slovenia's chances in blizzard conditions when Ukraine took the lead in the second leg, but these boys are used to snow, and Miran Pavlin managed an historic equaliser. How do you beat them? Arrange for it not to snow. Play on large, well-watered pitches in high-tec stadiums full of partisan supporters. What's their manager like? Srecko Katanec, a former Stuttgart and Sampdoria player who was the only Slovene in the last united Yugoslavia squad at Italia 90. 'Spirit is what matters the most,' he says. 'We can only achieve good results if we are all motivated, all good friends and play with our hearts.' A Slovenian view on Slovenia 'We're not a footballing country. We'll be surprised if we get a point but our fans will still watch and have fun. If the team play with their hearts we will love them.' Goran Obrez (Epika). The Slovenian Des is... 'We have no Des Lynam. No-one liked football very much before now'. Fair enough. Chant 'Slovenia gre naprej, Slovenia gre naprej' (Slovenia goes on, Slovenia goes on)",

      "body": "<p><strong> How did they qualify? </strong> Comfortable winners of Group One, though losing 3-2 at home to Denmark did not impress their highly critical spectators. Dino Zoff, needless to say, is already under a certain amount of pressure to do well in Euro 2000. </p> <p><strong> Surely Italians don't care about two-bit competitions like the European Championships? </strong> True, otherwise they would have managed to win it on more than the one occasion (1968, since you ask). But Italy are not exactly setting World Cups on fire either these days, and the country is locked in a debate about whether to stifle matches in the traditional manner or embrace the new, pan-European trend for open, entertaining football. Arrigo Sacchi bore the brunt of Italy's unexpected failure at Euro 96, and though Cesare Maldini's side looked solid enough in the last World Cup and only lost in the quarter-final to France on penalties, the manager was condemned for being too unadventurous. And for looking like Iggy Pop. </p> <p><strong> How do you beat them? </strong> Either show more attacking imagination (not difficult), or show none at all and hope the game goes to penalties. The Italians are almost as bad as England at penalty shoot-outs. </p> <p><strong> Won't they miss Christian Vieri?</strong> Well anyone would, the world's most costly footballer adding some muscle to all that Italian sophistication. But the replacements aren't bad either (see below).</p> <p><strong> How do they beat you? </strong> They have the most expensive forwards in the world (even without Vieri). Filippo Inzaghi, Vincenzo Montella and Alessandro del Piero all know where the goal is. And their defence is usually top notch too, with a long list of goalkeepers and full-backs of the calibre of Paolo Maldini and Christian Panucci to complement a newish centre-back pairing of Fabio Cannavaro and Alessandro Nesta. </p> <p><strong> Tournament record</strong> Semi-finalists in 1988, otherwise nothing to speak of since 1968. World Cup winners in 1982 and finalists in 1990, but Italy have been a declining force since rule tweaks gave an advantage to attacking teams 10 years ago. </p> <p><strong> What's their manager like?</strong> Dino Zoff, one of Italy's most famous and most capped goalkeepers and veteran of 1968, has yet to establish a style after taking over from Maldini. He's in something of a no-win situation with his public, who will no longer tolerate caution yet are reluctant to see Italy takes risks. Zoff was pilloried when Italy went looking for more goals against Denmark and paid the price for not shutting up shop. The team's confidence was still low when they subsequently lost 3-1 to Belgium in a pre-tournament friendly. </p> <p><strong> The typical Italian player looks</strong> like a film star (but is probably better paid.)</p> <p><strong> The main man is...</strong> It's time for the divinely talented Alessandro del Piero, a consistent underachiever on the international stage, to show the rest of Europe what he's capable of. </p> <p><strong> Would love to beat</strong> France or Germany in the final. </p> <p><strong> Finest hour?</strong> Winning the World Cup twice in succession in the Thirties, beating West Germany in the 1982 final, inventing practically a whole new ball game during the Sixties and Seventies. </p> <p><strong> Worst moment?</strong> Realising Brazil too, were playing something entirely different in 1970, failing to qualify for European Championships in 1976, 1984 and 1992. </p> <p><strong> Fans favourite?</strong> Paolo Maldini, one of the only constants in Italian national football in recent times.</p> <p><strong> We love to hate </strong> Roberto Baggio, but since he won't be playing either we'll have to make do with the slightly less precious del Piero. </p> <p><strong> Too good for Italy</strong> Paolo di Canio. </p> <p><strong> An Italian view on Italy</strong> 'For the first time in our history we won't be among the favourites.

      "bodyText": "How did they qualify? Comfortable winners of Group One, though losing 3-2 at home to Denmark did not impress their highly critical spectators. Dino Zoff, needless to say, is already under a certain amount of pressure to do well in Euro 2000. Surely Italians don't care about two-bit competitions like the European Championships? True, otherwise they would have managed to win it on more than the one occasion (1968, since you ask). But Italy are not exactly setting World Cups on fire either these days, and the country is locked in a debate about whether to stifle matches in the traditional manner or embrace the new, pan-European trend for open, entertaining football. Arrigo Sacchi bore the brunt of Italy's unexpected failure at Euro 96, and though Cesare Maldini's side looked solid enough in the last World Cup and only lost in the quarter-final to France on penalties, the manager was condemned for being too unadventurous. And for looking like Iggy Pop. How do you beat them? Either show more attacking imagination (not difficult), or show none at all and hope the game goes to penalties. The Italians are almost as bad as England at penalty shoot-outs. Won't they miss Christian Vieri? Well anyone would, the world's most costly footballer adding some muscle to all that Italian sophistication. But the replacements aren't bad either (see below). How do they beat you? They have the most expensive forwards in the world (even without Vieri). Filippo Inzaghi, Vincenzo Montella and Alessandro del Piero all know where the goal is. And their defence is usually top notch too, with a long list of goalkeepers and full-backs of the calibre of Paolo Maldini and Christian Panucci to complement a newish centre-back pairing of Fabio Cannavaro and Alessandro Nesta. Tournament record Semi-finalists in 1988, otherwise nothing to speak of since 1968. World Cup winners in 1982 and finalists in 1990, but Italy have been a declining force since rule tweaks gave an advantage to attacking teams 10 years ago. What's their manager like? Dino Zoff, one of Italy's most famous and most capped goalkeepers and veteran of 1968, has yet to establish a style after taking over from Maldini. He's in something of a no-win situation with his public, who will no longer tolerate caution yet are reluctant to see Italy takes risks. Zoff was pilloried when Italy went looking for more goals against Denmark and paid the price for not shutting up shop. The team's confidence was still low when they subsequently lost 3-1 to Belgium in a pre-tournament friendly. The typical Italian player looks like a film star (but is probably better paid.) The main man is... It's time for the divinely talented Alessandro del Piero, a consistent underachiever on the international stage, to show the rest of Europe what he's capable of. Would love to beat France or Germany in the final. Finest hour? Winning the World Cup twice in succession in the Thirties, beating West Germany in the 1982 final, inventing practically a whole new ball game during the Sixties and Seventies. Worst moment? Realising Brazil too, were playing something entirely different in 1970, failing to qualify for European Championships in 1976, 1984 and 1992. Fans favourite? Paolo Maldini, one of the only constants in Italian national football in recent times. We love to hate Roberto Baggio, but since he won't be playing either we'll have to make do with the slightly less precious del Piero. Too good for Italy Paolo di Canio. An Italian view on Italy 'For the first time in our history we won't be among the favourites. Dino Zoff has contaminated the players with his own confusions. The players are very tired in their bodies, very depressed in their minds. We will not qualify.' Sergio di Cesare (Gazzetto dello Sport.) The Italian Des is... Well there is Alessia Merz, the former glamour model-turned-Lynam (minus the moustache) but our informant was not impressed. 'We have too many,' he said wearily of Italian TV pundits.

The phrase, 'This is the worst German team ever', is now a German cliche.</p> <p><strong> How do you beat them?</strong> With increasing ease. (Scotland and the US - twice - are among their recent conquerors.) Germany lack skill. The crucial thing is to pass the ball around and to avoid any tussles for fifty-fifty balls, which Germans always win. Franz Beckenbauer says that if you woke up the German World Cup-winners of 1990 in the night and made them play the current side barefoot, they would hammer them.</p> <p><strong> How do they beat you? </strong> Germany still possess the 'German virtues', ie they run their socks off, kick like mules, and never leave their posts, but not much else. They retain a couple of secret weapons: Oliver Kahn is possibly Europe's best keeper, and the Germans remain excellent at penalties.

      "bodyText": "How did they qualify? Haltingly. Germany were stuck in an absurdly easy group. They handled Finland, Moldova and Northern Ireland with relative aplomb, but lost in Turkey and eventually qualified by holding the Turks 0-0 at home. The phrase, 'This is the worst German team ever', is now a German cliche. How do you beat them? With increasing ease. (Scotland and the US - twice - are among their recent conquerors.) Germany lack skill. The crucial thing is to pass the ball around and to avoid any tussles for fifty-fifty balls, which Germans always win. Franz Beckenbauer says that if you woke up the German World Cup-winners of 1990 in the night and made them play the current side barefoot, they would hammer them. How do they beat you? Germany still possess the 'German virtues', ie they run their socks off, kick like mules, and never leave their posts, but not much else. They retain a couple of secret weapons: Oliver Kahn is possibly Europe's best keeper, and the Germans remain excellent at penalties. They even have a reserve goalie by the name of Hans-J\u00f6rg Butt who is not merely an expert at saving the things but also at taking them.

There is no reason why he should not do so again, rather than just being asked to fill space, and deny it to the opposition, in order to occupy a problem position. 'He can be a raider for us in the same way that Marc Overmars is for Arsenal,' says Tony Adams.</p> <p>John Barnes once told me that Liverpool's way of playing was designed to feed McManaman the ball into space, that dangerous area between the opposition's midfield and attack. It is not a question of McManaman being given a free role. After all, he has shown his defensive, tackling qualities at Real and was certainly expected by Venables to track back for England. It is more about setting up the team up so that the best of his game can be inflicted on the opposition. Barnes was one who rarely did for England what he could for his club. If McManaman becomes another, it could well say more about Keegan than the player.

When he dropped out because of injury I would have brought in Guppy. He is more of a dribbler than Wilcox, but he is a natural left-side player and if you were tell him to get the ball into the box as early as possible, I think he would do it. </p> <p>Apart from Shearer and Phillips, the other major source of England goals is obviously Scholes. He needs to have someone who can cover for him when he goes forward, and Gerrard fits the bill perfectly.

      "body": "<p>In football, managers usually depart the way they arrive - fired with enthusiasm. Usually, too, they are chosen as the antidote to what has preceded them. Take the history of the England team over the last decade.</p> <p>There was Graham Taylor, decent, honourable and well-suited to the Football Association blazer. He represented the logical conclusion of the direct-style English game of the Eighties but both he and it were ultimately found wanting when it came to the tactical nuances of the international game. </p> <p>He was followed by Terry Venables, who finally succeeded in getting the most out of the more gifted players, employing to boot the adage that you had better treat them like men because sooner or later you are going to have to ask them to play like men. Venables was in tune with the development of the modern game and his mobile team promised progress. There was scepticism within the Football Association, though, about his tangled business affairs and he and they fell out.</p> <p>Then came Glenn Hoddle, supposedly clean-cut, loosely described as a born-again Christian, who appeared likely to carry on the Venables modernisation programme, and who couldn't possibly embarrass them. He did, by departing from the physical to the spiritual, even if the whole episode of comments about the disabled now seems more of a fiasco than it did at the time. More significant was his dourness of character, his players never really warming to him as he kept himself at too great a distance from them.</p> <p>Which brings us to Kevin Keegan, bubbly, charismatic and enthusiastic Kev, approachable and talkative, with more entries in the various entertaining volumes of the Football Book of Quotations than virtually anyone else. He was the only choice, said the FA, looking to a Mr Motivator to inspire the players and excite the nation after a hitherto listless qualifying campaign for Euro 2000. The reservations have always been about his qualifications for the job and the quality of expertise he might bring to it but the FA clearly decided it was no time for quibbling.</p> <p>He has indeed at least returned some optimism to the country's game. No sooner had England qualified for this summer's European Championship finals by the play-off back door than he was showing his front by declaring, customarily wearing his mouth on his sleeve, that the country could even win it. Whether he will remain in perception as an appropriate leader will unfold over the next month. For it is only in a major tournament that an international manager's true mettle can properly be judged.</p> <p>In many ways, Keegan is one of the more fortunate of England's managers. As Tony Adams, the man he has earmarked as his England captain when Alan Shearer retires from international football after Euro 2000, told me: 'He's got a lucky face.' In the usual black-and-white English fashion - how appropriate that Keegan's most memorable management days have so far been at Newcastle United - he was hailed as a worldbeater after England beat Scotland 2-0 at Hampden Park last November. Four days later, there was Euroscepticism as England lost 1-0 at Wembley. The fortuitous spin-off was that expectations this summer are consequently probably lower than they have ever been for an England team going to a tournament. </p> <p>As one of its most influential figures, the Keegan story says much about the culture of the English game over the past few decades as he dragged himself up by the bootlaces from humble origins, worked tirelessly on self-improvement but was frustrated at the highest level, despite much club success. It is undoubtedly why he retains the common touch and a passion for the game to stoke the home fires, qualities for which people forgive him much amid the occasional foot-in-mouth disease from which he suffers.</p> <p>Kevin Joseph Keegan OBE (for services when a player) was born in Armthorpe, near Doncaster, on Valentine's Day of 1951 and has been in love with the game ever since. There was a time when he walked away from her but eventually her allure drew him back as it always seemed likely to do. 'What do you find to replace football?' he once asked. 'Because there isn't anything.' </p> <p>As a kid, he kicked a ball around a patch of green known as the Bullring in the mining area of Balby near Doncaster, a town guaranteed to give solid grounding in the game of the working man and forge ideas of better things. Keegan has retained elements of both, daring to dream while we professional doubters doubt. Not that his first professional club was glamorous. On away trips with Scunthorpe United, the local Evening Telegraph reporter (Tom Taylor, Graham's dad) would sit him on his knee on the coach and, game for a laugh, Keegan would act as ventriloquist's dummy. No dummy was he, though. Bill Shankly would sign him for Liverpool and so began one of the great English careers, one that yielded 63 caps to add to the sweet silver sound of Anfield's golden era.</p> <p>Shankly also became Keegan's mentor and ever since his speech has been punctuated with the great man's aphorisms. Indeed, Keegan is fond of telling players of similar darting-striker style to 'go and drop a few hand grenades out there.' He did it with Gavin Peacock in his first match at Newcastle. Now he tells Paul Scholes for England.</p> <p>It was appropriate that Keegan should have moved to Hamburg after his glittering career with Liverpool. German football was blue-collar industrious and functional and by his own admission, he made the most of what was not a natural talent, working diligently to access the depths of his playing resources. He flourished in such an atmosphere of professionalism, winning two European player of the year awards. The Germans nicknamed him Mighty Mouse.</p> <p>It was fitting, too, that he should return to play for Southampton, leading them to their highest league position of runners-up, as he had now developed a fondness for unusual challenges. Finally as a player, he took Newcastle back into the top flight before being helicoptered away in front of St James' Park's wondrous gaze. In their eyes, it might have been to Mount Olympus. The Messiah had got them out of the mess.</p> <p>And that seemed to be that. Perhaps drained by having extracted every ounce of his abilities, he took himself off to Spain, scene of his only World Cup, all 27 minutes of it when he was rusty after a back injury and missed a gilt-edged chance as England slipped out of the 1982 tournament. The experience, coupled with him later finding out that his international career was over from the press rather than the manager Bobby Robson, seemed for a while to sour him. He vowed that he would not be tempted back into the English game, certainly not as a manager.</p> <p>Eight years later came Sir John Hall to rekindle the affair and there followed five years of rebuilding Newcastle into the regional giant it had once been. At the age of nearly 41, Keegan had his first managerial job in his second coming. After his first game, a 3-0 win over Bristol City as he fought to keep the team out of the old Third Division, he observed: 'I always thought managers were more involved but when it comes down to it, I just sit there and watch like everyone else.' </p> <p>During his tenure, the man who once described himself as an open book revealed every side of himself. Early on, Keegan threatened to resign when there appeared little money to strengthen the team. 'It's not like in the brochure,' he famously said. Sir John stumped up. Keegan has a convincing line in persuasion.</p> <p>Managers often try to instil in their teams that which they themselves sense they lacked; George 'Stroller'Graham's fierce work ethic at Arsenal, for example. Keegan was infatuated with players of flamboyant gift, intrinsic to them, unlike his own - David Ginola, Faustino Asprilla - though he would also value Alan Shearer's manufactured productivity that so mirrored his own. His selection of England's captain, his persona on the pitch, through some tricky times in the last year, confirms it. Keegan's Newcastle side went on to play with a cavalier flair that was short of the defensive resilience necessary to win the Premiership title. 'A rollercoaster type of team,' said his main rival Sir Alex Ferguson. </p> <p>To the strains of 'My Way', Keegan pressed on with his brand of thrilling but unfulfilled football, however. When he sold Andy Cole, there was uproar but he simply invited critics to apply for the manager's job themselves. 'Welcome to the grey hair club,' he told John Aldridge, another former Liverpool striker going into management at the time (in Aldridge's case, Tranmere Rovers).</p> <p>When Keegan faced the final curtain, believing his authority undermined by the City suits raising financial points of order, Tyneside was shocked. On the day he left a Sunderland-supporting train driver halted by the banks of the big river and announced that this was now the chance for any Newcastle fans aboard to throw themselves in. </p> <p>'If Kevin Keegan fell into the Tyne, he'd come up with a salmon in his mouth,' Jack Charlton once said of him. Smoked salmon from the Harrods food hall actually. The penchant for the offbeat challenge resurfaced and Keegan became Mohammed Al Fayed's lucrative henchman at Fulham, charged with getting them up to the Premiership within five years. </p> <p>As he was chauffeured out of Craven Cottage on his first day, having spent two hours with the press, he waved from a limo and smiled. It told of the man - more often gestures to scribes involve fewer fingers and a different expression - showing him to be humanly friendly but almost regal in the English game. Tony Blair once said that his children were unimpressed by all the world leaders traipsing through 10 Downing Street but were in awe when he said he had met Kevin Keegan. </p> <p>He began at Fulham as something called chief operating officer but taking over the manager's job was only a matter of time. Job half-done, at first he resisted England's blandishments but as if to answer the question about what are minds for if not for changing, he took the caretaker's post. He liked the job so much that he agreed a three-year contract. The mistress that is the England post is like that. With its needs rampant, Graham Taylor may once have called it the impossible job but few are the men, flattered by the attention, who can resist her. As he squires his biggest squeeze at Euro 2000, she will make unprecedented demands on the character and judgement formed by his career thus far. The real deal begins here.</p> <p>Typically of the English game, Kevin Keegan possesses no coaching qualifications. In Italy and Germany, those put in charge of the national team come through the ranks having been groomed and coached themselves. The France team that won the World Cup in 1998 was the product of a well-planned system, the now-Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier at its apex as technical director. </p> <p>The English game seemed to have learned, with Howard Wilkinson installed as Houllier's counterpart and a structure of development put in place. Keegan's appointment seems a regression, almost a panic measure as return to the knee-jerk responses of managers' departures.</p> <p>The advantages were that England were getting a popular figure with whom the supporters could identify, in contrast to the aloof Hoddle who finally appeared to have lost the mood of the country. 'Fans want to sing,' he once said about all-seater stadia, 'and unless you're Val Doonican, you can't do that sitting down.' In addition, his teams had a reputation for style. He mirrored, too, a nation's desire for passion play. 'He is like rocket fuel,' said an eccentric character by the name of Watt Nicholl, a sort of sports psychologist whom Keegan briefly invited into the England camp early on to cheer his players. Now had Hoddle employed such a figure</p> <p>The reservations have also concerned an occasionally touchy temperament, leading to fears that he could simply walk away if the going gets tough, since he is a rich enough man to do so having known his own worth; \u00a3750,000 a year with Fulham, \u00a31m, including endorsements, with England. He resents both accusations, but just about resists a temptation to bristle when they are raised, knowing that to do so would only fuel them. </p> <p>He defies a critic to tell him when he has ever quit and has explanations aplenty for England after the World Cup of 1982 - he was dropped, simply saw which way the wind was blowing and announced his retirement from the international game - Newcastle in '97 - his power being diluted - and Fulham '99, which was said to be an amicable arrangement.</p> <p>Nevertheless, a spat with Sir Alex Ferguson has become one of those magic television moments. It was the run-in to the 1995-96 Championship and Manchester United were closing fast on Newcastle. Ferguson had riled Keegan with some of his trademark verbal psychology and Keegan was provoked into his 'I'd luv it if we beat them, absolutely luv it,' tirade in response.</p> <p> He risked his dignity, in the manner of Graham Taylor with his 'I'm waking up with my pyjamas soaking wet,' Channel 4 documentary but redeemed himself in one way. 'The day I stop being emotional about football is the day I'll be back in Spain playing golf,' Keegan subsequently said and the fans identified anew. On the other hand, the team had seen his strain. They were to crumble.</p> <p>He has also been ridiculed for some of his television remarks. 'England look the only side who can go on and win this,' he said shortly before Dan Petrescu's winner for Romania at France 98; David Batty will score, he insisted, moments before that penalty was saved against Argentina a fortnight later. 'You can't do better than a 0-0 draw away from home,' he once said. </p> <p>But at least he is decisive, willing to climb off the fence on which the apprehensive and cowardly sit. As someone remarked, it's not falling down that is the mistake, it is being frightened to get up once you have fallen.</p> <p>You ask him now about feeling any stress as England manager and how he might react to it in the summer and his face momentarily says 'Do I not like that question.' Then he rambles engagingly, ending characteristically on an upbeat note. 'I think I'll cope all right with it,' he says. 'I've got a good staff around me and we're well-organised for the tournament. We've crossed every 't' and dotted every 'i'. The downside is that if it doesn't go well, yes the flak will fly. But I also get the chance to do what no England manager has done: that is to win a major tournament away from this country.' </p> <p>It is significant that on his first full day in office he said that he wanted to emulate the boys of '66 and he has subsequently often referred to English football's touchstone moment; again in tune with the nation's sense of its own pride but na\u00efve, and even potentially damaging with its lack of humility, about the national team's true standing these days. (His record, in truth, is no more than average: four wins from his first 11 games.)</p> <p>A comment by one of his former charges, Steve Howey, is revealing. 'It's impossible to dislike Kevin,' said the Newcastle centre-back, reminiscing about life under him at the club. 'You come in one morning feeling down but watching him whizz about brought you back to life. He wasn't really bothered about things like practising free-kicks but he made five-a-side feel like the World Cup.'</p> <p>While players might feel that he can be a jovial friend - and the way his own England career ended has led to him saying that he will be sensitively telling in person any player cut from the squad - they should not ignore a potential for ruthlessness. The story goes that he once went to scout a player and left after the pre-match warm-up because he didn't like the way the player ran.</p> <p>There have been signs lately that Keegan, in common with all his predecessors, has been irked by press comment, notably on the question of whether England would practise penalties this time. They would, he said, but not against Germany. However, the rider that this was because it was a group game and not knock-out was lost as he was made to look foolish.</p> <p>But back he soon came with a disarming way, that a charming Bobby Robson also possessed, of continuing to talk football with reporters because it so enthused him. Keegan also has the knack of making an interviewer feel valid so that he elicits understanding. He is honest, but with a tendency to people-please by giving the answer he thinks they want to hear. One week recently, for example, he said that Graeme Le Saux was definitely out of Euro 2000. A fortnight later he said he would take him if he could just play one end-of-season game. Le Saux himself, to whom Keegan did not speak for four months, knew that he was never going to be fit.</p> <p>'I approach it in the same way you would if you had the job,' he said when asked about any trepidation he might feel this summer. 'You look at your squad and I think we have a really good squad. Yes you could argue that the balance could be better but every other manager or coach is thinking the same thing. We have got a mass of strikers and defenders but we don't have a lot of full-backs. No-one has perfection.'</p> <p>Therein lies the acid test. Keegan may indeed be a genial fellow but the job is about technical expertise and how he melds what he has at his disposal. On that, and consequent results, he should accept, and does, that he will be judged. 'My job is to try to get the players who can win a tournament for us into the side without it being a mish-mash,' he says. 'I'll probably be the first to admit in the past that it hasn't worked when I've experimented.' </p> <p>He was referring to Steve McManaman, who has proved himself over the last couple of months an outstanding creative influence on Real Madrid (see panel). Hearteningly, Keegan believes he can accommodate him now in the England team the way Terry Venables did during Euro '96 in more appropriate areas than simply being isolated wide on the left. Currently (and despite the 4-4-2 he played against Brazil) it seems quite possible that his team will line-up in 3-5-2 formation because it suits the players. He appears to have accepted that he can no longer fit square pegs in round holes. 'I'm not as cavalier as people make out,' he says now of his development. 'I do like winning and I know what it takes to win.' To do that, he will need also to be flexible enough to adapt should games need a change of approach.</p> <p>If he can, it will render redundant the caveats about no left-footed player of real note and concerns that England may revert to playing in straight lines, as they often did pre-Venables, rather than with the movement and adaptability they showed in Euro 96. If not, England may finally have to look to a coach of national gravitas - possibly foreign for the first time - rather than of clubbable personality.</p> <p>Unlike Hoddle, Keegan is a personality who likes to sit and eat with his players and regale them with stories, mainly of the Bill Shankly era. For the younger players, it might seem as 'now'as Tales from Hoffnung. It is to be hoped he also listens to the veterans of foreign fields like Adams and Shearer. 'Maybe a character like Kevin is what we need at the moment,' says Adams. 'When it comes to knowledge, I think there are enough of us able to share it with him.' </p> <p>After just over a year as manager, one thing Keegan has learned. 'Everything about the England job is magnified,' he observes of life in the goldfish bowl. Actually, it resembles more being on exhibition in some Damien Hirst tank. The summer will tell us whether the formaldehyde will be needed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In football, managers usually depart the way they arrive - fired with enthusiasm. Usually, too, they are chosen as the antidote to what has preceded them. Take the history of the England team over the last decade. There was Graham Taylor, decent, honourable and well-suited to the Football Association blazer. He represented the logical conclusion of the direct-style English game of the Eighties but both he and it were ultimately found wanting when it came to the tactical nuances of the international game. He was followed by Terry Venables, who finally succeeded in getting the most out of the more gifted players, employing to boot the adage that you had better treat them like men because sooner or later you are going to have to ask them to play like men. Venables was in tune with the development of the modern game and his mobile team promised progress. There was scepticism within the Football Association, though, about his tangled business affairs and he and they fell out. Then came Glenn Hoddle, supposedly clean-cut, loosely described as a born-again Christian, who appeared likely to carry on the Venables modernisation programme, and who couldn't possibly embarrass them. He did, by departing from the physical to the spiritual, even if the whole episode of comments about the disabled now seems more of a fiasco than it did at the time. More significant was his dourness of character, his players never really warming to him as he kept himself at too great a distance from them. Which brings us to Kevin Keegan, bubbly, charismatic and enthusiastic Kev, approachable and talkative, with more entries in the various entertaining volumes of the Football Book of Quotations than virtually anyone else. He was the only choice, said the FA, looking to a Mr Motivator to inspire the players and excite the nation after a hitherto listless qualifying campaign for Euro 2000. The reservations have always been about his qualifications for the job and the quality of expertise he might bring to it but the FA clearly decided it was no time for quibbling. He has indeed at least returned some optimism to the country's game. No sooner had England qualified for this summer's European Championship finals by the play-off back door than he was showing his front by declaring, customarily wearing his mouth on his sleeve, that the country could even win it. Whether he will remain in perception as an appropriate leader will unfold over the next month. For it is only in a major tournament that an international manager's true mettle can properly be judged. In many ways, Keegan is one of the more fortunate of England's managers. As Tony Adams, the man he has earmarked as his England captain when Alan Shearer retires from international football after Euro 2000, told me: 'He's got a lucky face.' In the usual black-and-white English fashion - how appropriate that Keegan's most memorable management days have so far been at Newcastle United - he was hailed as a worldbeater after England beat Scotland 2-0 at Hampden Park last November. Four days later, there was Euroscepticism as England lost 1-0 at Wembley. The fortuitous spin-off was that expectations this summer are consequently probably lower than they have ever been for an England team going to a tournament. As one of its most influential figures, the Keegan story says much about the culture of the English game over the past few decades as he dragged himself up by the bootlaces from humble origins, worked tirelessly on self-improvement but was frustrated at the highest level, despite much club success. It is undoubtedly why he retains the common touch and a passion for the game to stoke the home fires, qualities for which people forgive him much amid the occasional foot-in-mouth disease from which he suffers. Kevin Joseph Keegan OBE (for services when a player) was born in Armthorpe, near Doncaster, on Valentine's Day of 1951 and has been in love with the game ever since. There was a time when he walked away from her but eventually her allure drew him back as it always seemed likely to do. 'What do you find to replace football?' he once asked. 'Because there isn't anything.' As a kid, he kicked a ball around a patch of green known as the Bullring in the mining area of Balby near Doncaster, a town guaranteed to give solid grounding in the game of the working man and forge ideas of better things. Keegan has retained elements of both, daring to dream while we professional doubters doubt. Not that his first professional club was glamorous. On away trips with Scunthorpe United, the local Evening Telegraph reporter (Tom Taylor, Graham's dad) would sit him on his knee on the coach and, game for a laugh, Keegan would act as ventriloquist's dummy. No dummy was he, though. Bill Shankly would sign him for Liverpool and so began one of the great English careers, one that yielded 63 caps to add to the sweet silver sound of Anfield's golden era. Shankly also became Keegan's mentor and ever since his speech has been punctuated with the great man's aphorisms. Indeed, Keegan is fond of telling players of similar darting-striker style to 'go and drop a few hand grenades out there.' He did it with Gavin Peacock in his first match at Newcastle. Now he tells Paul Scholes for England. It was appropriate that Keegan should have moved to Hamburg after his glittering career with Liverpool. German football was blue-collar industrious and functional and by his own admission, he made the most of what was not a natural talent, working diligently to access the depths of his playing resources. He flourished in such an atmosphere of professionalism, winning two European player of the year awards. The Germans nicknamed him Mighty Mouse. It was fitting, too, that he should return to play for Southampton, leading them to their highest league position of runners-up, as he had now developed a fondness for unusual challenges. Finally as a player, he took Newcastle back into the top flight before being helicoptered away in front of St James' Park's wondrous gaze. In their eyes, it might have been to Mount Olympus. The Messiah had got them out of the mess. And that seemed to be that. Perhaps drained by having extracted every ounce of his abilities, he took himself off to Spain, scene of his only World Cup, all 27 minutes of it when he was rusty after a back injury and missed a gilt-edged chance as England slipped out of the 1982 tournament. The experience, coupled with him later finding out that his international career was over from the press rather than the manager Bobby Robson, seemed for a while to sour him. He vowed that he would not be tempted back into the English game, certainly not as a manager. Eight years later came Sir John Hall to rekindle the affair and there followed five years of rebuilding Newcastle into the regional giant it had once been. At the age of nearly 41, Keegan had his first managerial job in his second coming. After his first game, a 3-0 win over Bristol City as he fought to keep the team out of the old Third Division, he observed: 'I always thought managers were more involved but when it comes down to it, I just sit there and watch like everyone else.'

On the day he left a Sunderland-supporting train driver halted by the banks of the big river and announced that this was now the chance for any Newcastle fans aboard to throw themselves in. 'If Kevin Keegan fell into the Tyne, he'd come up with a salmon in his mouth,' Jack Charlton once said of him. Smoked salmon from the Harrods food hall actually.

      "body": "<p><strong>1 Roberto Baggio, Italy v Brazil, Los Angeles 1994 </strong></p> <p>The divine ponytail now seems unlikely to ever win a World Cup, so it will probably be his misfortune to be remembered for losing one. The stakes could hardly have been higher as Baggio the Buddhist stepped up. Not only had Claudio Taffarel just made a crucial save to put the onus of an entire World Cup on the next kick, he had dedicated it to his Christian God by pointing to the sky. Baggio's shot went in that direction, bringing a disappointing World Cup final to an abrupt but appropriate conclusion. </p> <p><strong>2 Joint award to Stuart Pearce, Chris Waddle, Gareth Southgate, Paul Ince and David Batty </strong></p> <p>Gazza cries and Pavarotti warbles once again as England wake up to how good they really are under Bobby Robson and push the West Germans all the way in a semi-final in Turin in 1990 at the Stadio delle Alpi. An expectant nation remains optimistic when the game goes to penalties, not yet realising what the next 10 years will hold, but we begin to get the picture when Pearce strikes the fourth penalty against Bodo Illgner's legs and Waddle balloons the fifth over the bar. </p> <p>Six years later it's England against the whole of Germany in the Euro 96 semi-finals at Wembley. People were expecting England to lose on penalties this time, realising that Germany were unlikely to be as generous from the spot as Spain had been in the quarter-final, which was partly why Southgate's body language seemed to say 'Why me?' from the start. The Aston Villa defender was hoping he would not be required, but it fell to this extremely occasional striker to take the first sudden-death penalty when the initial phase finished 5-5. Southgate missed, or rather Andreas Kopke saved, and Germany had arranged matters so that their experienced captain Andy Moller was available to score from the next kick and book another final at England's expense. </p> <p>Two years later it's Argentina at France 98, and after a thrilling game which England were unlucky not to win in normal time, the expectation was that the penalty shoot-out would end in tears. So it did, with penalty tyro Batty attracting more criticism than Ince, who was the first England player to miss. The plain truth is that England did not have enough penalty experts on the pitch at the end, partly due to David Beckham's infamous dismissal. But Glenn Hoddle's contention that this was the best prepared England World Cup side ever looked a little glib when it emerged that his squad had never practised taking penalties. </p> <p><strong>3 Didier Six and Maxime Bossis, France v West Germany, Seville, 1982 </strong></p> <p>An earlier semi-final with the World Cup's first ever shoot-out and arguably its greatest miscarriage of justice. No real blame attaches to Six and Bossis for missing their kicks, the villain of the piece was Harald Schumacher, the German goalkeeper who saved them. Schumacher should have been dismissed minutes from the end of normal time for a vicious professional foul which denied France a winning goal and put Patrick Battiston in hospital. Incredibly he was not even penalised, and stayed on to see Germany through the shoot-out after coming back from 3-1 down in extra time. Small consolation for the glorious French side of Platini, Giresse and Tigana that Italy won the final, or that France won the European Championship two years later. </p> <p><strong>5 Victor Ikpeba, Nigeria v Cameroon, 2000</strong></p> <p>The miss that wasn't - and it cost Nigeria the African Nations Cup. One of the worst refereeing decisions ever witnessed (and the linesman was most to blame as he was standing on the byline) handed the cup to Cameroon, much to the dismay of a packed crowd in Lagos last February. After a 2-2 draw the game went to a shoot-out. With the score 3-2 to Cameroon Ikpeba, who plays for Borussia Dortmund, struck his shot against the underside of the bar. It clearly crossed the line by about a foot, but the Tunisian referee, Mourad Daami, said 'no goal'. The complaints on a BBC African website would take a tree to turn into print.</p> <p><strong>6 Liu Ying, USA v China, Los Angeles, 1999</strong></p> <p>The women's World Cup may still be some way from attracting the same interest as then men's (though not in America), but at least its finals can be decided the same way. The defining motif of the 1999 Women's World Cup was Brandi Chastain in her sports bra, shirt waved in triumph above her head, after burying the USA's fifth, and winning penalty. The goat of the piece was China's Liu Ying who had taken the third spot-kick for her country. The midfielder placed it to Briana Scurry's left but not far enough. The American keeper guessed right and palmed the ball away. For Team USA the only miss of the shoot-out made legends of them all. For Liu Ying from Beijing there were only tears. </p> <p><strong>7 John Aldridge, Liverpool v Wimbledon, Wembley 1988 </strong></p> <p>Of all the FA Cup finals in which to miss a penalty, it had to be this one. As soon as one or two high-minded observers of the game expressed the view that it would be bad for football were the Crazy Gang to beat Anfield's Quality Street collection in such a major showpiece, Wimbledon seemed fated to defy the odds and accomplish the unthinkable. Never more so than when Dave 'Lurch' Beasant saved Aldridge's penalty to preserve the lead Lawrie Sanchez had given the underdogs, who went on to win 1-0. 'No complaints,' said Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish. 'I thought it was a soft penalty award anyway.' </p> <p><strong>8 Dennis Bergkamp, Arsenal v Manchester United, Villa Park 1999</strong></p> <p>This was the penalty which could have put Arsenal into a second successive FA Cup final and stopped Manchester United's Treble in its tracks. Still slugging it out with United in the League, Arsenal had held them to a draw in the first FA Cup semi-final, and appeared to have the replay sewn up when their opponents first lost Roy Keane and then conceded a penalty in injury time. Peter Schmeichel was equal to Bergkamp's kick, however, allowing Ryan Giggs to supply the extra time heroics and United to reach for glory. </p> <p><strong>9 Billy Austin, Manchester City v Newcastle United, 1926</strong></p> <p>On the last day of the 1925-26 season Manchester City went to Newcastle needing a point to avoid relegation from the First Division. A run of four consecutive wins suggested they would do so. They were awarded a penalty, only for outside-right Billy Austin to miss it. It proved a crucial error: Newcastle won 3-2 and City went down. It had been a bad week for them. A week earlier Bolton had beaten them in the FA Cup final. </p> <p><strong>10 Any penalty taken by the Corinthians </strong> The famous amateur side used to miss penalties on purpose, or tap the ball lightly back to the goalkeeper, believing that as all foul play was accidental it would be unsporting to take an unfair advantage from the penalty spot. Any resemblance between this archaic philosophy and Manchester City's penalty record is entirely coincidental, apparently.</p> <p><strong>Justifying his selection</strong></p> <p>This month's 10 were selected by Paul Wilson, The Observer's football correspondent. Here he explains his choice:</p> <p>The list may be dominated by penalty shoot-outs, and fairly recent history, but that's just the way the game is these days. Doubtless there were nervous penalties and significant misses before the artificial drama of the shoot-out, though it takes a real effort to call many to mind now that the images and their like have set up permanent home in the collective subconscious. </p> <p>How dramatic can an open-play penalty be in any case? The ultimate scenario would be a penalty award in the last minute of a Cup final with the scores level, but if scored the match is won and if missed the game simply goes on. John Aldridge was the first player to miss a penalty in an FA Cup final, but had he scored there is no guarantee Wimbledon would not have grabbed a winner in extra time. Dennis Bergkamp's miss in injury time in an FA Cup semi-final was arguably the most significant open play penalty drama in recent memory, since had he been successful Manchester United would surely have been denied their Treble. </p> <p>Penalty shoot-outs by definition are more climactic, and the price of failure is usually instant elimination from a World Cup or a major tournament, which is why they make such compulsive viewing and why we remember them so vividly. This is a necessarily personal selection, drawn many from games I was lucky enough to attend, with a handful of important milestones thrown in. There may have been more abysmal shooting performances from the spot - the 28 penalty marathon between Hong Kong and North Korea in 1975 which lasted almost as long as the match itself springs to mind.</p> <p>Shoot-outs are cruel because they are lost rather than won, and once the finger of failure points the stigma can last for years, but if two teams are still neck and neck after two hours of open play it is generally going to take something arbitrary to divide them and shoot-outs at least have the advantage of being decisive and highly watchable.

It was historically inevitable and just now the historical conditions have been fulfilled. Goodbye to the biggest failure and disappointment since the non-return of Christ,' he wrote.</p> <p>Now his views appear to have mellowed. Yesterday he said: 'The story of the Resistance is extremely complex, and whereas the communists massacred entire villages in some places, I understand that in others they set up drama classes.'</p> <p>De Berni\u00e8res's account of the changes he has made to the Greek version of his book mirrors the efforts British film-makers have made to reassure the citizens of Cephalonia (also known as Kephalonia) about their plans. One prominent politician conceded that many did not want the book filmed on the island at all. 'There was a lot of under-the-table negotiations to have the film take place on Cephalonia,' said Gerassimos Apostolatos, a distinguished former Conservative MP from the island.</p> <p>'All over our island there were cases of real-life Corellis and Pelagias, but the book is also full of things that really offend,' said Gerassimos Artelanis, mayor of Sami where much of the movie is being filmed. 'So we set up a committee of historians working alongside all the island's mayors and decided the British film company would have to confirm that what they were making was a love story and not a political story... because you know not even we Greeks have decided who was right and wrong during the civil war. It's still a bitter thing.'</p> <p>The British film-makers confirm the delicacy of their negotiations. 'It is true the local prefect asked us for assurances that the film would not touch on Greece's brutal civil war,' said Kevin Loader, one of three British producers. 'We had no problem doing that because it was always going to be a love story and nothing else,' added Loader, whose London-based Working Title Films counts Four Weddings and a Funeral among its box-office draws.</p> <p>De Berni\u00e8res said yesterday: 'It was never part of the purpose of Corelli to stir up bad blood. Corelli is about other themes, and I wouldn't want the book to be distorted for Greek readers, which is why I agreed with my publishers and translator that some of my language and opinions should be moderated. The Greeks don't need some foreigner sticking his oar in when they can, and do, perfectly well argue among themselves.'</p> <p>Although the author says 'nothing was actually cut', the novel was amended to placate a potentially hostile audience prior to its publication in Greece in 1995.</p> <p>Several offending passages have been excised altogether. Greek readers who turn to chapter 63, for instance, are not told that 'the communists began to deport awkward characters to concentration camps; from a safe distance they had watched the Nazis for years, and were well-versed in all the arts of atrocity and oppression.' They do not read that 'Hitler would have been proud of such assiduous pupils'.</p> <p>Nor do they see the author's note, which was published in the early English language editions of the book and appears in other foreign editions. It is in the note that de Berni\u00e8res berates the 'disconnected intellectual' who has traditionally tried 'to maintain that the Greek communists were romantic heroes who were unjustly oppressed by the imperialist and duplicitous British, in order to restore the monarchy against the will of the people'.</p> <p>'I have tried to be as true to history as possible,' he writes. 'I have been unable to conclude otherwise than that, when they were not totally useless, perfidious and parasitic, they were unspeakably barbaric.' With such snippets removed, the novel was initially well received in Greece where one critic wrote that a 'Greek could not have written better'.</p> <p>Over 25,000 copies have been sold since Psichogios, the Athenean publishing house, first printed it in 1995. It is now being flagged as a 'Hymn to our Homeland'.</p> <p>In the giant film-set that is Sami, the word is out that the British author may soon be visiting. Those thankful for the book's impact on local tourism have already implored the mayor to make him an honorary citizen. 'But you know,' said Mayor Artelanis, 'what I would really like to ask him is where he got all his information from. If they turn it into a political film, then we will take measures.'</p> <p>'You can be sure that we will take the issue to the international court of justice at the Hague.

      "bodyText": "The bestselling story of Greece's bitter struggle against Italian occupation during World War Two, Captain Corelli's Mandolin, has become embroiled in controversy even as filming of the book gets under way on its island setting of Cephalonia. Makers of the film, which stars Nicolas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hurt, have had to persuade anxious islanders that the blockbuster will be a love story, and will not reopen old wounds by concentrating on the brutal anti-fascist struggle and ensuing civil war. Now the book's author, Louis de Berni\u00e8res, has conceded that changes have been made to the Greek edition of the book because of fierce criticism of its portrayal of communist atrocities. And, after accusations that he distorted history to portray the country's leftist partisans as 'dehumanised sadists', the author says he 'might be wrong'. 'After the writing of Corelli it became clear to me that many people were genuinely offended by the portrayal of the Communist Resistance, or simply thought that it was inaccurate,' de Berni\u00e8res wrote yesterday in an email sent to The Observer. 'I haven't actually changed my mind about what I think is the truth, but I had to bear in mind the possibility that I might be wrong.' The book describes a love triangle between a member of Greece's communist Resistance movement, an officer in the Italian occupying force on Cephalonia, and Pelagia, the beautiful daughter of the local doctor. It includes accounts of communist atrocities against their right-wing foes during the civil war that followed Italy's occupation. Only last year the soldier-turned-writer issued a blistering assault on the tiny circulation Morning Star for accusing him of promoting crude anti-communism in the book. 'How long are you people going to sit in the dark in an air pocket, wanking each other off? Your ship has sunk, brothers. It was historically inevitable and just now the historical conditions have been fulfilled. Goodbye to the biggest failure and disappointment since the non-return of Christ,' he wrote. Now his views appear to have mellowed. Yesterday he said: 'The story of the Resistance is extremely complex, and whereas the communists massacred entire villages in some places, I understand that in others they set up drama classes.' De Berni\u00e8res's account of the changes he has made to the Greek version of his book mirrors the efforts British film-makers have made to reassure the citizens of Cephalonia (also known as Kephalonia) about their plans. One prominent politician conceded that many did not want the book filmed on the island at all. 'There was a lot of under-the-table negotiations to have the film take place on Cephalonia,' said Gerassimos Apostolatos, a distinguished former Conservative MP from the island. 'All over our island there were cases of real-life Corellis and Pelagias, but the book is also full of things that really offend,' said Gerassimos Artelanis, mayor of Sami where much of the movie is being filmed. 'So we set up a committee of historians working alongside all the island's mayors and decided the British film company would have to confirm that what they were making was a love story and not a political story... because you know not even we Greeks have decided who was right and wrong during the civil war. It's still a bitter thing.' The British film-makers confirm the delicacy of their negotiations. 'It is true the local prefect asked us for assurances that the film would not touch on Greece's brutal civil war,' said Kevin Loader, one of three British producers. 'We had no problem doing that because it was always going to be a love story and nothing else,' added Loader, whose London-based Working Title Films counts Four Weddings and a Funeral among its box-office draws. De Berni\u00e8res said yesterday: 'It was never part of the purpose of Corelli to stir up bad blood. Corelli is about other themes, and I wouldn't want the book to be distorted for Greek readers, which is why I agreed with my publishers and translator that some of my language and opinions should be moderated. The Greeks don't need some foreigner sticking his oar in when they can, and do, perfectly well argue among themselves.' Although the author says 'nothing was actually cut', the novel was amended to placate a potentially hostile audience prior to its publication in Greece in 1995. Several offending passages have been excised altogether. Greek readers who turn to chapter 63, for instance, are not told that 'the communists began to deport awkward characters to concentration camps; from a safe distance they had watched the Nazis for years, and were well-versed in all the arts of atrocity and oppression.' They do not read that 'Hitler would have been proud of such assiduous pupils'. Nor do they see the author's note, which was published in the early English language editions of the book and appears in other foreign editions. It is in the note that de Berni\u00e8res berates the 'disconnected intellectual' who has traditionally tried 'to maintain that the Greek communists were romantic heroes who were unjustly oppressed by the imperialist and duplicitous British, in order to restore the monarchy against the will of the people'. 'I have tried to be as true to history as possible,' he writes. 'I have been unable to conclude otherwise than that, when they were not totally useless, perfidious and parasitic, they were unspeakably barbaric.' With such snippets removed, the novel was initially well received in Greece where one critic wrote that a 'Greek could not have written better'. Over 25,000 copies have been sold since Psichogios, the Athenean publishing house, first printed it in 1995. It is now being flagged as a 'Hymn to our Homeland'. In the giant film-set that is Sami, the word is out that the British author may soon be visiting. Those thankful for the book's impact on local tourism have already implored the mayor to make him an honorary citizen. 'But you know,' said Mayor Artelanis, 'what I would really like to ask him is where he got all his information from. If they turn it into a political film, then we will take measures.' 'You can be sure that we will take the issue to the international court of justice at the Hague. We will fight it all the way. For us Captain Corelli must be what it is very good at - a love story from beginning to end.'

      "body": "<p>In my kitchen is a big white bowl. It is more than a foot across and heavy enough to need two hands to lift. Round, with a thick base, and the colour of milk, its sides curve slowly outwards towards the rim, like a pair of hands making an offering. I can't remember where it came from - all I know is that it has become a part of my kitchen. Whether it holds a salad of tiny leaves, a mountain of mash or a summer trifle, it is always there, turning up without fail at mealtimes, like a ravenous child. </p> <p>It is not an old bowl, at least in the heirloom sense of the word, and is as plain as they come. It has seen the best of my cooking, and the worst. My bowl has held almost every salad I have ever eaten, and many of my puddings. It has marinated chops and played host to chocolate mousse; soaked chick peas and supported jellies; ripened fruit and cradled mounds of pasta. There is a generosity to this great big earth-mother of a dish. </p> <p>There is something quietly pleasing about serving food in a dish that has made a place for itself in your kitchen. I like meals that have a sense of place, and I think the same goes for tableware, too. Most people seem to have something in their kitchen that has a history, having been passed down for generations like the family silver. Sadly, I have no family heirlooms in mine. I have never had much of a passion for Pyrex. </p> <p>Big White, as it is affectionately known, has had a life away from the table, too. As friends and family tuck into clouds of lemon syllabub or pools of banana custard, I somehow forget to mention the time it was once used to provide enough water to feed a friend's panting Labrador. And I usually fail to bring up the occasion when I used my beloved dish as a steam bath to clear my sinuses. This bowl has had a life. </p> <p>There have been bad times. There was my brief fling with an exquisitely rounded Italian number, during which time my faithful platter stood by me, quietly fuming but brave-faced, like a porcelain Mary Archer. (End of story: the Italian job turned out to be just a distraction.) </p> <p>Sometimes it seems as if a dish was specially made for a particular recipe. I am not talking about avocado dishes or egg coddlers, but a vessel that appears perfectly suited to the food it contains. Your food looks comfortable. The cast-iron dish in which I always make my lasagne; the pot-bellied cream jug; the blue-edged enamel tin from the ironmongers I keep for milk puddings: there is something pleasing and reassuring about the right food in the right dish. This extends even to the broken-handled cup of dripping in the fridge. No other bowl or jug would seem right. </p> <p>Several years ago, a generous reader made a bowl for me in her art class. I use it to this day. Bubblewrapped to the hilt, it survived the trauma of the postal system and even an accidental ride on the pot-wash cycle in the dishwasher. With its brilliant turquoise flecked with purple, there is something ancient and Mediterranean about the bowl. Purple-black Ligurian olives or black figs look indescribably beautiful in it. I feel certain its maker had such a cargo in mind. </p> <p>I must admit that my china is, almost without exception, catering-strength oven-proof white, originally made for the hotel industry. There is nothing delicate about it, save its colour. I have a deep, pathological loathing of patterned china. Plates should never be allowed to upstage the food that sits on them. Like clothes, they should always be understated. Armani if you like, rather than Versace. </p> <p>With the advent of summer lunches outside, the big white bowl spends much of the time on the garden table - which is exactly where it is now. (Actually with a bit of dead salad in it, but it takes such horrors in its stride now.) Its spacious curve is perfect for serving a main-course salad. A favourite is salmon and French beans, an English salad ni\u00e7oise, if you like. Lentils too, with a balsamic vinegar dressing whose rich mahogany gloss shows up so well against the white. Filled with punnets of raspberries, it smacks of untold extravagance. My favourite salad of Charantais melon and blackberries sits coolly amongst the acres of blank French porcelain. Its no-frills colour and soft sheen make even the most understated of dishes look peaceful, confident, tempting. </p> <p>Cool, white, generous and pure - what more could anyone ask of something in which to sit their food. When I hear of piles of white plates being smashed in a Greek restaurant, I cannot understand why anyone would want to destroy such a thing when there are so many gilded, flower-etched monsters just begging for it. Spike Milligan once famously force-fed the manager of Harrods' Food Hall with spaghetti in protest against its stocking foie gras. I would much prefer being let loose with a baseball bat in the Fine China department. It is on the fourth floor, if anyone is interested. </p> <p><strong> The River Cafe's pappa al pomodoro fresco</strong><br> </p> <p> The title may be awkward and the design formula looking past its sell-by date, but the recipes in the new River Cafe Green (Ebury, \u00a330) are anything but, with fresh ideas shining from every page. The authors' enthusiasm for vegetables and fruit and their relentless search for quality is legendary, but somehow the recipes seem even more tempting in this, their third book. This is as dazzling and imaginative a collection of vegetable recipes as you are ever likely to find in one book. I love their restaurant and I love their recipes; Ruth Rogers and Rose Gray have done it again. Serves 6. </p> <p>2kg very ripe, mixed tomatoes (cherry vine, plum, large yellow and red) </p> <p>Maldon salt and freshly ground pepper </p> <p>olive oil </p> <p>4 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped </p> <p>3 ciabatta loaves, crusts discarded, cut into large pieces </p> <p>1 large bunch of fresh basil, leaves torn </p> <p>150ml extra-virgin olive oil </p> <p>Preheat oven to 150 C/gas mark 2. Place the cherry vine tomatoes on a baking tray, season with salt and pepper and drizzle with oil. Bake for 40 minutes, then put through a mouli into a bowl. Set aside. </p> <p>Plunge the plum tomatoes in a large amount of boiling water for 1 minute, then remove and allow to cool in a large colander. Repeat with the large yellow tomatoes. When cool, skin the tomatoes, cut in half and remove the seeds. Chop the plum, yellow and red tomatoes coarsely. </p> <p>In a large, thick-bottomed saucepan, heat 2 tbsps olive oil and gently fry the garlic until soft but not brown. Add the chopped tomatoes, season and cook over a medium heat for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the pur\u00e9ed tomatoes and bring to a boil. Add the bread to the tomatoes and turn off the heat. </p> <p>Stir until the bread absorbs the liquid. If too dry, add a small amount of boiling water, but remember, the soup should be very thick. Add the torn basil leaves, season with salt and pepper and combine with the extra-virgin olive oil. Let the soup sit for at least half an hour, as you should serve it - in a large bowl - lukewarm, never hot. </p> <p><strong> Goat's cheese with thyme and olive oil </strong><br> </p> <p> My white bowl is at its most poetic when used to marinate a piece of meat or grilled vegetables. The deep emerald of the olive oil and lush green of the herbs look almost too good to disturb. I often make a meal of marinated cheeses and bread, offering up a few slices of coppa and some figs. Serves 6. </p> <p>8 small goat's cheeses </p> <p>6 small sprigs of thyme </p> <p>3 bay leaves </p> <p>2 small dried chillies </p> <p>8 black peppercorns </p> <p>olive oil to cover </p> <p>Put the goat's cheeses into a large bowl and tuck the herbs and chillies around them. Crack the peppercorns with a heavy object such as a pestle or even a can of something - you just want to split each one into two or three rather than crush them. </p> <p>Pour enough olive oil over the cheeses to just cover them, then cover the bowl tightly with clingfilm and set aside somewhere cool overnight. The refrigerator will do, but bring them out and back to room temperature for an hour before serving. </p> <p><strong> Grilled salmon salad with basil and mustard dressing</strong><br> </p> <p> Serves 4 as a light salad. </p> <p>500g salmon fillet </p> <p>6 handfuls of tiny salad leaves (rocket, soft lettuce and baby spinach) </p> <p>4 medium tomatoes, each skinned and cut into six </p> <p>a small handful of basil leaves, shredded </p> <p>16 black olives </p> <p> <strong> for the mustard vinaigrette</strong> </p> <p> 2 small, sweet garlic cloves </p> <p>1 tbsp grain mustard </p> <p>1 tbsp red wine vinegar </p> <p>6 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil </p> <p>Place the salmon, skin-side down, on a baking sheet and brush with melted butter, then grill until the fish is opaque and tender enough that you can pull a large flake away from the bone. Let the fish cool briefly, then peel away the skin and break the fish into large chunks. Do not crush or mash the fish; it should come away in big, juicy flakes. </p> <p>Peel the garlic and crush it to a pulp with a little salt under a knife blade. Scrape it up and drop it into the salad bowl. Spoon in the mustard, then beat in the vinegar and oil with a small whisk or fork. You want a dressing that is thick and somewhat gloopy. </p> <p>Tear the salad up a bit where the leaves are large and drop into a large bowl. Toss gently with the tomatoes, basil, olives and the dressing, but do not crush the leaves. Add the chunks of fish and serve. </p>",

The deep emerald of the olive oil and lush green of the herbs look almost too good to disturb. I often make a meal of marinated cheeses and bread, offering up a few slices of coppa and some figs. Serves 6. 8 small goat's cheeses 6 small sprigs of thyme 3 bay leaves 2 small dried chillies 8 black peppercorns olive oil to cover Put the goat's cheeses into a large bowl and tuck the herbs and chillies around them. Crack the peppercorns with a heavy object such as a pestle or even a can of something - you just want to split each one into two or three rather than crush them. Pour enough olive oil over the cheeses to just cover them, then cover the bowl tightly with clingfilm and set aside somewhere cool overnight. The refrigerator will do, but bring them out and back to room temperature for an hour before serving. Grilled salmon salad with basil and mustard dressing Serves 4 as a light salad. 500g salmon fillet 6 handfuls of tiny salad leaves (rocket, soft lettuce and baby spinach) 4 medium tomatoes, each skinned and cut into six a small handful of basil leaves, shredded 16 black olives for the mustard vinaigrette 2 small, sweet garlic cloves 1 tbsp grain mustard 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 6 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil Place the salmon, skin-side down, on a baking sheet and brush with melted butter, then grill until the fish is opaque and tender enough that you can pull a large flake away from the bone. Let the fish cool briefly, then peel away the skin and break the fish into large chunks. Do not crush or mash the fish; it should come away in big, juicy flakes. Peel the garlic and crush it to a pulp with a little salt under a knife blade. Scrape it up and drop it into the salad bowl. Spoon in the mustard, then beat in the vinegar and oil with a small whisk or fork. You want a dressing that is thick and somewhat gloopy. Tear the salad up a bit where the leaves are large and drop into a large bowl. Toss gently with the tomatoes, basil, olives and the dressing, but do not crush the leaves. Add the chunks of fish and serve.",

I was shown similar films during similar holidays when I was 13 and 14, by way of a continuing education in the facts of the Holocaust. </p> <p>Eventually, when I was 15, I was taken to the site of Dachau concentration camp during a tour of Europe organised by a Jewish youth group (these holidays for Jewish kids could be a little intense at times). I stood amid the huts and the fences and I remembered the images I had seen and I tried to feel something. Sadly, I felt little. I had been exposed to so much so soon that I had somehow become inured to it all. </p> <p>Time passes. I have grown up and my emotional responses have returned. But I could not help wondering, as I stood on Friday before the carefully realised exhibits of the new \u00a35-million Holocaust Exhibition at the Imperial War Museum, which opens to the public on Wednesday, whether we now run the risk of similarly deadening what should be a visceral response to the darkness of the Holocaust, by our very approach to it. </p> <p>No one can be against an exhibition of the Holocaust. It would be like declaring an opposition to a cure for cancer. The atrocities we are capable of committing against each other should be marked and, as the survivors begin to die - as memory hands over to history - there is a biological imperative to do so. It matters not at all that the events of the Holocaust occurred outside this country. It is irrelevant that other cities around the world - Paris, Berlin, Washington DC - have already created their own institutions dedicated to the events. It is vital that Britain has a serious resource of its own for the purposes of education. </p> <p>What's more, this new exhibition has been intelligently conceived. A concerted effort has been made to give the mass of victims back their individuality. Video testimonies of 17 survivors punctuate the narrative as it passes from the prosperity of European Jewry pre-1933 through the Nazi's rise to power, the brutal persecutions of the Jews and eventually the industrial rigour of the Final Solution itself. </p> <p>Even if the grammar and vocabulary of the exhibition is occasionally familiar - the stacks of shoes, the frayed rags of concentration camp uniforms, those images of the dead at Bergen-Belsen that I remember from my childhood - the impact is not lost. I found the pictures of the starving children of the Warsaw Ghetto almost unbearable, just as they should be; a 35ft model of a portion of the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex, completely bleached of colour, takes the breath away. </p> <p>But this exhibition does have a major weakness and it lies not in what is there, but what isn't. When the project was first announced back in 1994, the museum said it would include material not just on the genocide of the Jews but also on the killings of Armenians by Turks, and on the mass murders in Cambodia, Bosnia and Rwanda. That has not happened. While there is information about the fate of gypsies, gays and the disabled under the Nazis, this is resolutely an exhibition about European Jewry. A separate gallery dedicated to other genocides in the twentieth century opens next year. </p> <p>David Cesarani, Professor of Twentieth Century Jewish History and Culture at Southampton University, an advisor on the project and one of Britain's most astute scholars of the Holocaust, was among those who argued successfully that the genocide of the Jews by the Nazis should stand alone. It was, he said, unique in terms of the centuries-old Christian anti-Semitic ideology that underpinned it and the industrial might used to carry it out. Doubtless he is right in identifying, in such a precise and academic manner, that which separates the Holocaust from other atrocities. </p> <p>But this kind of project cannot just be about academic precision. If we emphasise the uniqueness of the Holocaust then we undermine its ability to teach us anything, save that it happened. It rejects any attempt at comparison with subsequent events and an exhibition dedicated to it runs the risk of becoming simply a memorial to the Six Million - not a terrible outcome but much less than a project like this could achieve. </p> <p>There is, after all, no league table of atrocity. Granted, the murder of one million Rwandan Tutsis in 1994 was not conducted through the industrial means used in the genocide of the Jews 50 years earlier. But does that really mean that there are no direct connections to be made between the two? What troubles me most is that the legions of school children who will be the exhibition's core audience, may simply come away with the impression that the crimes of the Holocaust were something that their great-grandparents' generation were capable of rather than anything that could, in one form or another, be repeated today. </p> <p>And that is how this kind of history becomes merely an intellectual experience rather than the out-and-out emotional one it should be. Like the 15-year-old I once was, standing in the dusty corridors between the inmates' huts of Dachau, visitors to the exhibition may eventually find themselves intrigued but strangely unengaged.

      "body": "<p>My first task at Chelsea, where I was covering the show for television, was to choose my favourite garden. It was still 36 hours until the show opened, and all of the exhibitors were frantically putting the finishing touches to their gardens and exhibits. 'Take your time,' I was told, 'No hurry. We don't need to know which one it is for at least 15 minutes.' </p> <p>I didn't have a favourite garden. I very much liked what I could see of about three or four, couldn't think what to think about another three or four. I heard someone making glib, snap judgements to their clip-boarded companions. It was me. All power corrupts, but telly corrupts absolutely. </p> <p>It is axiomatic to understand that in all programmes covering real events, hardly anyone involved has any idea of what is going on. Still covered in the sheen of a fever, the aftermath of a terrible bug, I knew less than anyone. A script was thrust into my hands and my ear-piece fitted. Ear-pieces are horrible. The only time I have ever used one is at the Chelsea Flower Show. They are all supposed to fit like a glove, being individually moulded to your ear by a man in Harley Street who pushes a kind of warm putty into your ear and makes a cast of the result. My ear must have been doing impressions of someone else that day. In fact, I associate Chelsea with a nagging, then piercing pain in my left ear that starts about an hour after I put the horrible thing in. </p> <p>No one told me, but I was supposed to memorise chunks of the script and read the rest off the autocue. I need half a dozen goes to memorise someone's name, let alone their words. When I interview anyone, however familiar, there is always a moment of sheer panic just before we are about to record when I totally forget who they are. Utter blank. But this is Chelsea. This is gardening. The first programme went out and the message filtered back that the powers that be thought I seemed more relaxed than usual. My children rang me to say that I looked eye-poppingly mad and covered in the thickest make-up they had ever seen. So no change there, then. </p> <p>Monday at Chelsea is judging day, so once the judges have been round, there is a tangible sense of the place exhaling. What is done is done. For some people, that means the closure on three-years' work, and for everybody a chance to stop for a moment after weeks of 18-hour days. The soap celebs totter in to promote a charity or a flower or themselves, and the press, in their hundreds, do the show. I had to do a piece for Channel 4's Real Gardens from a crane above the ground. The cameraman and I were hoisted up smiling cheerily at the production team. I immediately felt travel-sick. Cranes look as though they rise like a slow lift, but when you are in them they adjust and set their position in a series of lurches like sudden turbulence in a plane. The cameraman announced that he hated heights and couldn't look down. Swaying like a poppy in the breeze, we did about 15 versions of the opening sentence before swooping down again. </p> <p>But I appreciate that not many people get the chance to see Chelsea from that vantage point. The new plastic pavilions, with their dozens of turrets, gleamed in the early sun, and Wren's Royal Hospital sat like a stately home hosting an elaborate game fair, or a joust. People, of course, are ants. It was worth coming just for this view. </p> <p>If you appear regularly on telly, however incompetently, you fall into the dubious category of 'celeb'. Going round with an attendant film crew does nothing to dispel that notion. This seems to have a particular effect peculiar to Chelsea (or maybe it is true of any occasion where 'celebs' get together, but I always avoid gatherings of that tribe like the plague). You meet and kiss - mwhoa mwhoa - people you don't know but who know you, or who you recognise and greet like lost brothers but actually have only met twice before, both times at the Chelsea Flower Show. And while you are kissing some stranger's cheek, a really interesting person who you would love to meet walks modestly by. </p> <p>Anyway, sod 'em all and their TV-pancake glam. We had our own in-house celeb this year. Oakleigh Nursery wrote to my wife Sarah asking if they could name an angel pelargonium after her. For every plant sold, \u00a31 would go to the NSPCC. Sarah had her own photocall, and the plant was launched. We both feel genuinely proud and moved. This was practically my only visit to the new pavilions for about three days, which is mad, but there was never a moment. </p> <p>This is the worst aspect of the job. I love the tents at Chelsea. If ever I was to show there (and I won't), I would feel much more at home with a nursery stand than a show garden. The stands under cover are manned by people who have modestly, and with unbelievable labour and dedication, grown all the incredibly beautiful plants that you see. They make precious little money from it. When I turn up all in a rattle of sharp suits and film crews, I feel ashamed of myself. </p> <p>As you walk round filming, all the time aware that you have an absolute deadline which is impossibly close, people stop and ask if you will have your picture taken with their stand/daughter/friend. I pose with a family from Bexley dressed up as Red Indians and turn down posing with Charlie Dimmock. Not through choice, you understand, but because we were filming. </p> <p>The show gardens start to filter into some kind of analysis in my brain, as I walk about inside them filming. Christopher Bradley Hole's garden for The Daily Telegraph is brilliant and grown-up in a way that few Chelsea gardens are. Tom Stuart Smith's has floral planting that is ravishingly pretty. The Gardens Illustrated garden (also sponsored by The Observer ) is lovely and expert and turns out to win best in show, although I hear through the grapevine that it was a close call between Tom's garden and theirs. Everybody loves the Leyhill Prison garden, although I'm sure there is a touch of middle-class guilt going on there. It doesn't need any of that - it is plain charming. </p> <p>Food is snatched and eaten in the production site between the Embankment and the show gardens. This has become a claustrophobic village street with offices, huge trucks with edit suites and all the other filming paraphernalia. For the rest of the week, when 40,000 people a day are milling around the showground, this busy, muddy alley is the quietest place at the show. </p> <p>I walk to the loo and am grabbed by the arm. Will I do a quick interview for Radio Kent? Without saying why, I tell them that it had better be quick. Duck into a tent, talk into a microphone at a garden table for two minutes and rejoin original mission. </p> <p>Roy Lancaster says the plant of the week is the plum-coloured thistle, Cirsium rivulare atropurpureum. We have been trying to get this plant for our Jewel garden for the past three years, and every nursery seems to be sold out. All gone to Chelsea, I suppose. Sarah rings me to say I have to nick one off a show garden, if need be. </p> <p>I long for my garden, long for home, long for the children, long for peace, long to dig, long for the chickens running splay-legged across the orchard, long for sleep. </p> <p>On Tuesday, I work on three TV programmes simultaneously. I am never really sure which one I am doing at any given moment. One of the researchers tells me that one of them, a live programme between 3.30pm and 4pm, went out with his active involvement without him ever being aware it was being broadcast. Because some programmes are live and others recorded, I have to be aware of continuity and change clothes up to four times a day. By the end of the week, the stuff for the Sunday night recorded show reeks of me. </p> <p>And the flowers? The gardens? All the plants and inspiration? The new kit unveiled and all the experts to chat to? I was only at Chelsea for six long days, so couldn't possibly have time for any of that. At the end of it, I flop into a limo driven by a man in a hat to go home, take my suit off and do some gardening.</p> <p>\u0095 Oakleigh Nurseries, Petersfield Road, Monkwood, Alresford, Hampshire (01962 773 344) was awarded a silver medal</p>",

One of the researchers tells me that one of them, a live programme between 3.30pm and 4pm, went out with his active involvement without him ever being aware it was being broadcast. Because some programmes are live and others recorded, I have to be aware of continuity and change clothes up to four times a day. By the end of the week, the stuff for the Sunday night recorded show reeks of me. And the flowers? The gardens? All the plants and inspiration? The new kit unveiled and all the experts to chat to? I was only at Chelsea for six long days, so couldn't possibly have time for any of that. At the end of it, I flop into a limo driven by a man in a hat to go home, take my suit off and do some gardening. \u0095 Oakleigh Nurseries, Petersfield Road, Monkwood, Alresford, Hampshire (01962 773 344) was awarded a silver medal",

      "body": "<p>She's 50 minutes late and I'm starting to walk toward the door when I see her. She's smaller and thinner and sadder than I expected from that hieratic movie-star face and the wild bad-girl spirit she projects on screen - the best bad girl in movies today. She looks beaten and dogged. I think about keeping on going because I'm pissed off and of course she doesn't recognise unfamous me, but then something in her beaten face stops me and I say, 'Angelina' and she looks at me, hesitates, remembers that she shouldn't stop because I might be a wacko and starts to keep going and by the time I say, 'It's me, John, I'm supposed to meet you', she's already figured it out and stopped in her tracks, defeated by all the little hesitations and revisions of decency and expediency. I don't remember what we say first, but a minute later she's saying she is sorry, really sorry, we should just give this up and I say, No, it's OK, and she says, No, it's not OK, nobody should be kept waiting for 50 minutes, why would you want to talk to me now? She's sorry but she also seems to be on the edge of flashing anger because I won't accept her being sorry and it's so quick and mercurial I feel very much like I'm dealing with a crazy person. Half of what she says I can't follow, it's in some private language about things that happened to her recently and she's so jittery and raw I say, Don't be sorry, I would have been mad before but I can see you're a suffering human being and it's not that big a deal. At some point she starts to cry - a tear wells in her eye and leaks down her cheek. We're standing here in the lobby of the Museum of Modern Art and I suggest we sit down in the sculpture garden, but she's convinced it's ruined and all her fault. She's very skinny and pale and is wearing no make-up, a few blotches on her face, and I get glimpses of her arms, which are marked with black tattoos and it's not two minutes in her presence before I check those long arms for tracks. Don't see any, but every time I step closer to her so I can get into normal human speaking range, she steps back six inches or a foot more than normal. Did she just smoke a joint? She's wearing black leather pants and a black T-shirt with white sweater fuzz all over it and I catch myself starting to say, I really loved your performance in Girl, Interrupted, but I stop myself because I hate that kind of gushing on principle and it seems particularly wrong right now, completely inadequate. She says she hasn't eaten all day and I ask a couple more times if she wants to get something to eat or to sit down and she clearly just wants to crawl out of her skin and her dad's been in his hotel for two days and she hasn't even had time to call him. I start telling her my now clearly useless idea for an interview based on an article in The Atlantic Monthly by Sue Erikson Bloland about being the daughter of a famous person and the associated distortions and how weird it was when her dad became the world's most famous child psychologist and successful, accomplished people would get strangely childlike in his company and I've got her attention now, she's calming down just listening to my voice, and I say, I thought maybe we could talk about that and she says, We're already talking about it and I feel the nervous antennae of her attention reaching out and twitching back and suddenly it just hits me that this whole thing is wrong and I find myself saying, Maybe you shouldn't be doing this. You don't need to be on magazine covers. Publicity isn't for everybody and maybe you should just not do this interview or any interview ever again. But that seems to set her on the edge of tears again and she tells me, No, it's all about communication - movies, magazines, it's all communication and that's important to her and she's almost pleading with me and it's so weird because even at the premiere last night, the premiere for The Bone Collector, the photographers told her brother to move out of the shot so they could get one of just famous her and her famous dad and it's obvious that even the memory gives her pain - she's all nerves and anything that touches the wrong spot stings. And I suggest again that maybe we should have a bite or something and she rubs her arms and looks this way and that and finally I just give her my card and say, 'That's my home number and you can call me or not call me, whatever, it's all good, and she's twisting and twisting my card into lint and saying how she's thinking maybe she doesn't even need acting, maybe she should just move to the country and have a kid and I think, For God's sake don't do that - thinking of the kid. And some instinct tells me that firmness and authority is the ticket so I say, This is the deal, you're getting back from LA on Thursday and that's when my wife leaves on vacation and I have to take care of the kids - she smiles at that - so if you decide to call, you have to give me some notice so I can get someone to baby-sit. And she says, What do you have and I say, Girls, and she asks ages and I tell her and the human moment seems to relax her and so I say, Hey, if you want, come up to my house and hang out with us and then she really smiles and says she'd like that. So we talk about where I live and how close it is to where she's buying her farmhouse and I get the feeling that even though she won't commit to a meal or a seat somewhere all I have to do is keep talking and she'll keep standing here forever. But people are streaming around us and I can't even use my tape recorder and frankly the whole thing is getting a little wearying, so finally I usher her to the door and outside she perks right up, spots a pretzel stand and gets one and we start walking. The food seems to steady her. The freedom of movement seems to steady her. She says a friend said something about fuck you or she said fuck you to the friend and I find her pretty hard to follow - some of it's coherent and some of it isn't even a little bit. We go up a few blocks and she says, Are you walking me somewhere or am I walking you somewhere. My office is two blocks back so I say, I'll walk you to the corner, and then when we get there I point in different directions and say - aware by now of how definite statements soothe her - You're going that way and I'm going that way, and she smiles and I lean in to kiss her on the cheek because I really do like her now and feel sorry for her and hope it all works out, and her return kiss catches me on the side of the mouth and then she flashes me the most beautiful smile I have ever seen - she's so grateful to be set free. </p> <p>She doesn't call, of course, but when I finally check in with her manager, the office person says she told them to give me her home number. Which is pleasing. But I don't know, I've been reading about female movie stars and this line of Marilyn Monroe's is stuck in my brain: 'Everybody wants a piece of you,' she said (and then fell to pieces). And James Mason said at Judy Garland's funeral that she gave so much so completely that 'she needed to be repaid, needed devotion and love beyond the resources of any of us'. And it makes me feel kind of sick because I know I wanted my little piece of Angelina, and wasn't I shocked and a little thrilled when she came apart in my hands? And if she did a Garland or a Monroe, which seems all too possible on the evidence so far, wouldn't I end up owning a pretty little piece of that? </p> <p>But what the hell, we all have a job to do. So I call the beautiful young movie star at home. She sounds sleepy but glad enough to chat and after a while I say, 'So, what about us? Do you want to do this thing?' She says she's going to be near my neighbourhood on Saturday with her dad and brother. She'll drop by around one, if that's all right. </p> <p>Saturday morning, I clean up. But not too much. Five minutes before one, she calls, I give directions to her driver and 30 minutes later a black stretch limo pulls into my driveway. I go down and shake hands with Angelina's dad, who introduces me to his son and the limo driver, and then they follow me up the garden path. </p> <p>Inside, Angelina's dad notices our dining-table chairs, which are in the middle of the room, and he smiles and asks who painted them. The kids answer - Rachel (who is nine) painted the one with the ladybird and the one with lots of drippy blue dots. Angelina's dad examines the kitchen cabinets my wife painted to cover up the 30-year-old stains and says he always wished he had the nerve to do something like that and I tell him poverty was the mother of that invention and I'm thinking what a sweet and almost childlike quality he has and how unusual it is in a movie star, yet how consistent with the characters he used to play. I'm also very aware that he's checking me out. He must be worried about this whole weird thing of his daughter visiting the media beast in its lair at this obviously sensitive stage in her life. </p> <p>Some of this I process only later. Because he is, after all, Jon Voight. And it's a bit of a job trying not to be distracted from my normal-guy routine by his undeniable Jon Voightness. </p> <p>Then Angelina asks the kids to show her their room and the three of them run down the stairs and disappear. Her dad and her brother go out for a walk. </p> <p>It's almost two and the kids haven't eaten. I make some noodle soup and dish out the Greek salad and when Angelina comes back upstairs she sits down and picks at her food - she says her dad was trying to force-feed her in the car and I can believe it, she's so skinny. I file the statement away in the part of my brain where I'm storing the Jon-Voight-is-worried-about-his-daughter material. </p> <p>Then I ask her if she wants some coffee or tea and she goes into completely incomprehensible story about her marriage and tea and how that was a sign of what was wrong because her ex-husband likes teapots with a whistle and she couldn't stand the whistle and so they always forgot that the tea was boiling and for some reason this meant they ended up crawling into the kitchen to get the teapot off the stove. Was the kitchen too small? Did they think it was going to blow up? Was it hurling so much steam around? I never quite get it. And I try. I am a professional reporter and do my best to dig it out of her and each answer is more tangled than the original story. No, not tangled, the right word is vaporous. Her sentences are like sheets of mist that start to evaporate the second they hit the open air. Meanwhile, she keeps picking at her salad in that distracted way, as if she isn't even aware she's eating. </p> <p>Finally, I take away the plates and Angelina says maybe we should get the tape recorder and do the interview thing - although she'd really rather play Nintendo with the kids. So I say maybe we should do that, play Nintendo, tape recorders being so alienating and all. </p> <p>What I don't say is that I'm afraid transcribing a tape of her talking will be like trying to unzip fog. But she insists, so I get the tape recorder and we wander downstairs and end up sitting on my daughter's bed. She's cross-legged, holding her heels in her hands under the Alanis Morissette poster and the fluorescent stars. </p> <p>'So tell me, did you read the article?' </p> <p>'Did I read the article?' </p> <p>'In The Atlantic. That I gave you.' </p> <p>'Oh, no. My brother has it.' </p> <p>I just say oh and let it slide, but she starts to explain that her brother got upset by the article and took it away from her so she wouldn't see it. Once again I have a lot of trouble following her. This is what she says: </p> <p>'That was very - how did he put it? I think he was upset. Yeah. Very upset. I don't know if he was - he had a weird reaction, I think. It's a weird reaction to see those things, because they're pointed out. And we were both there when he pointed it out. I don't know why he took it. Or if he got rid of it because it upset him. Or - there's a reason we didn't want to talk about it. So obviously it was quite a strong article.' </p> <p>Like I said, I haven't got a clue what she's talking about. 'Hmm. Interesting,' I say. 'Mysterious, but interesting.' </p> <p>'It was just one of those things that was - I started to read it. And I can see why some of that stuff that's in the title sometimes can - and not even me. But it's like the two of us now and oh shit, you know.' </p> <p>'So that's like a thing that -' </p> <p>'Hovering. The whole parent thing, and -' </p> <p>'The parent-fame thing?' </p> <p>'Um, yeah, it is and it isn't. It is in a great way. Because, you know, we talk.' </p> <p>And she goes on. Looking over the transcript now, after I've come to know her, it's very clear to me that it was all my fault, that I was suffering from a failure of imagination and trying to understand her as if she were normal when the only way to understand her is to crawl inside her language as if it were a complex modern poem and link up the elusive meanings and let go the things you don't understand. </p> <p>But let's get there by steps. The next thing she talks about is her father and how she loves him yet feels his image hovering above her, because no matter how far you've gone it's always like you've had help, whether you got help or not. Then she jumps off that train and into the subject of a recent photo shoot, which seems to have become for her a symbol of all that is wrong with being a movie star in the modern world. She tried to explain that she didn't want to be in lingerie or anything of a clich\u00e9d sexpot nature, but they threw in some lacy camisoles, 'which to me is verging on lingerie,' and they probably were hoping to get a little bra showing or see-through and it was just generally a disappointment and she's always tried to be a good little celebrity but she's getting really tired of it. Gently, I suggest that sex is a good thing and having seen a fair number of her previous photo spreads, they're not exactly lust-free zones. </p> <p>'Like the Rolling Stone cover - you were so glammed up.' </p> <p>'I wasn't all glammed up. The cover, I was totally red-faced from crying.' </p> <p>'Really?' </p> <p>'Because I felt like a whore.' </p> <p>Talking about it, she gets upset all over again. 'And I told him that. I told the photographer. And it's not Rolling Stone 's fault, and it's not, you know, the wardrobe woman's fault or anything. It's - the photographer just had his idea of me being - and I talked to him before and I said, you know, if they wanted to get me free or wild, that - but, you know, they kept saying which - the same as yesterday. I kept saying to them, you know, that I just wanted to - whatever they - just to show me what they want.' </p> <p>At this point, I realise that the teapot is probably boiling and since we don't have a whistle either, it'll just keep on boiling. But I don't say anything about it because I want to see if she'll remember and I'm trying to concentrate on figuring out the point she's trying to make. </p> <p>'And they would kind of say, Well, we want you to be happy, we want to relate to you. And you have to say, It's not me. I don't wear - it's a nice suit with shoulder pads and black leather pants, but I'm on a couch, looking like I'm just lounging or I've got smudgy eye make-up so it's more like I look slightly fucked up, and it's kind of the idea of, what are you getting across to people? Are you getting across to people that this is my idea of how a woman is sexual? Or if I'm being an actor, you can put me in dress-up, then that's me. But it's the idea of just acting like you're just hanging out with some gorgeous gown on, just hangin' out -' </p> <p>Finally I get it. And maybe it's because pushing through the word mists was so much work and maybe it's because she's so sensitive and lovely sitting here on my daughter's bed under the grrrl-queen posters and fluorescent stars, but getting it seems like a glorious miracle. 'It's like a phoniness,' I say. </p> <p>She shakes her head. 'It's just the idea of - what is it we're sharing with people, you know? You think, as an actor, or any kind of an artist, that you're kind of contributing something. And you don't always have to be doing that, but definitely not doing something where it's going the opposite direction. You know?' </p> <p>I nod, but I'm lost again. </p> <p>'And all women do have a different sense of sexuality, or sense of fun, or sense of like what's sexy or cool or rough or - you know, I like to be maybe cleaner. Maybe it would be nice for someone my age to not see someone in like some see-through tank top and jeans, but to see them in a cashmere sweater and slacks. Maybe they'd go in that direction.' </p> <p>Oh! Now I've got it. She's talking about social responsibility. Imagine that! This beautiful young movie star is sitting here in her black leather pants talking about social responsibility and telling the truth and how hard it is to refuse - I'm getting it, I'm getting it - to present some glamourised prefab image that further betrays our inner selves and leads the vast army of lost searchers out there to more loss of self and over-commodification and more desperate efforts, to buy or copy or otherwise consume all the pretty things we jam into the hole we used to call the soul here in the Supermarket of the Damned! Yeah! Go, baby! </p> <p>'And that's why we look at magazines, to see if we like different things, you know? So then you feel like -' </p> <p>'These are the options.' </p> <p>'Really - this is your presentation of what I feel is sexy. This is what I feel is fun, this is what I feel is interesting, and this makes me feel angular and wild and - you know?' </p> <p>Yes! Angular and wild, exactly! </p> <p>'I see,' I say. 'I got it.' </p> <p>Man, this feels good. If she'd set out to win me over, she couldn't possibly have picked a better tack than this peculiarly artless charm. It's not until much later that I get cynical enough to consider the possibility that her antennae picked that up somehow and that she might be playing to that. </p> <p>'The tea!' I say. </p> <p>And we both jump off the bed and run upstairs and while I get the mugs and stuff, she keeps talking about how the Rolling Stone guys were so disappointed because they thought she was so wild and free and I think of her in Gia, panthering around in the same black leather pants I just followed up the stairs and she says yeah, people seem to think that since she did a film about a bisexual junkie supermodel, that somehow translates into her stripping down to a G-string in magazines. </p> <p>'Do you want milk or sugar?' I ask. </p> <p>'Mmm. A little bit.' </p> <p>I give her both. Then we sit back down at the dining table. 'You were talking about how your dad and you have had these discussions about how real to be in interviews,' I say. 'How much truth to tell. And I'm not sure how much truth to tell either. I was reading about Marilyn Monroe the other night and she said, \"Everybody always wants a piece of you.\" And I've always felt a little uncomfortable with that movie-star thing because that's what you do, you try to take a piece of them.' </p> <p>She nods, but then she goes and disagrees with me. In fact, she says that it upsets her when actors talk that way because she gets so much from being an actor. And it's not even giving yourself or allowing yourself to be taken so much as it is throwing yourself open. And if people accept that, then it lets you put the pieces together. And as she talks about this I realise that either she's getting more lucid or I'm starting to understand her private language better. </p> <p>'But Jon and I do have this - we've talked about it before, because I'm really outspoken and I think he's been worried about me.' </p> <p>'Jon being your dad?' </p> <p>'Jon being my dad, yeah. I've talked about, you know, everything. And just being really outspoken about my marriage and, you know, being with women, and they will take it and turn it into different things. So he's wanting me to kind of be quiet. A lot of people wanted me to be quiet during Gia , to not say if I'd ever done any drugs, or had ever slept with a woman, which to me was being totally hypocritical. If I had, and if I could identify with the story that much more, and really saw a beautiful thing in another woman - so I thought it was nice to share what I had experienced, because I thought it was great - I didn't see why it was so bad.' </p> <p>One thing she's learned along the way is that when people are cruel or arrogant or cold, the 'missing elements' affect their work and when she watches them on film she sees them missing a beat here and there because they're not really listening. 'That's the reason for - that's the reason we kind of exist,' she says. 'It's like Our Job. To give to each other. And learn from each other. To capture moments of people. So it's like it's really strange to have somebody ignore the obvious human being right in front of them.' </p> <p>Right around here is where I really start to feel a little flush of shame at the memory of my conversations just last week with friends who told me they'd seen her on chat shows and she was 'not a good talker' or 'wacky' or worse and knowing that's probably exactly what I would have said if I was judging her as a performance of a person instead of this actual human being sitting across the table from me. And I say, 'But you know, it's funny, when I first met you at the museum I - I really thought you were like -' </p> <p>'Losing my mind.' </p> <p>I laugh. 'Losing your mind, yeah.' </p> <p>'I was disturbed,' she says, 'Just seeing you and seeing that you had kind of accepted it somehow, even though I could tell you were very angry, you were somehow like, That's the way it is.' She laughs. 'You know? Somehow you adjusted to it.' She laughed again, maybe a little nervously this time. 'You know? You don't have an ego about it or something. Which was so horrifying, to think that that would be OK.' </p> <p>I'm feeling it now myself - she's making me feel it with her own decency and regret - the sadness of all the adjustments of pride and need and financial desperation and the long history of rejection and humiliation that turned me into the kind of guy who would cool his heels in a museum lobby for 50 minutes waiting for a semi-famous beautiful girl. </p> <p>'Wow,' I say. </p> <p>'You know?' </p> <p>'Yeah.' </p> <p>'So.' </p> <p>'Yeah.' </p> <p>'So yeah.' </p> <p>After the limo pulls her out of my driveway, I'm so full of good energy. And I don't think it's just because she was beautiful and famous, although there's no way you can get around that - if she were an ugly guy, there's no way I'd have bothered to read her mists, much less get so smug about my fabulous mist-reading abilities. But that said, there's still something pure about her. And it felt like a gift. It felt as soft and innocent as one of my kids' butterfly kisses, that thing they do with their eyelashes against your cheek. </p> <p>And later when I watch Midnight Cowboy I realise that Angelina's dad has exactly the same pure spirit - there was so much hunger and tenderness and dumb love and joy just bursting out of him that it wasn't a performance at all but the voice that is great within us (as a poetry anthology called it) just shining through. It reminds me of what Pauline Kael, the celebrated film critic, said about actors, that when you get past the dialogue and the silly plots, it's always actors who are the most alive and fresh. Some more than others. And it's almost always the ones who have that wild innocent purity - the Monroes, the Garlands. The ones who 'break'. </p> <p>And then it hits me - of course. I get my tape recorder and summon my girls. 'I want to ask you something,' I say. 'When Angelina came, you guys went off with her and disappeared. What did you talk about?' </p> <p>Julie answers first. 'Um, well first we went downstairs, and she said everything was really cool and like all colourful and like wild and stuff. And then we went to the laundry room, which was all messy, and she said, \"I love this. It's so messy.\"' </p> <p>'If you can remember exactly what she said, that's good. Exact words are important.' </p> <p>'OK. And so then we took her to the other room? Our new room? She said it was going to be great. And then we went to Mom's office, and she was like shocked by the masks and said, \"Who did that?\" And I said, \"I did.\" And she was like, \"How did you do that?\" And I said, \"With papier-mch\u00e9.\" And she said, \"That's awesome.\" And then we went to your office, and we turned on the picture of your brain and I said, \"That's Daddy's brain,\" and she said, \"Eeew, gross.\" And then we went into your bedroom.' </p> <p>'Wait a second. Rachel, what is it?' </p> <p>'We went to your room before we went to the office.' </p> <p>'That's good. Accuracy is important.' </p> <p>'And then we went into your room,' Julia continues, 'and she - she liked the red walls. She said, \"It's so cozy.\" And she saw some more of our art and she said, \"You guys are so good. You must get that from your mom.\" And we said, \"Well, I don't know. We probably do.\" A-a-a-a-n-n-d, that's it.' </p> <p>'Anything you remember, Rachel? I'm gonna put this in, so, you know, think.' </p> <p>'Um. She also said she really like Julia's poster. That Beck one? She said it was cool. And she likes him too.' </p> <p>'So what'd you think of her?' </p> <p>'I thought she was nice,' Julia says. </p> <p>'Nice is not very descriptive. Tell me more. And don't necessarily be nice. Say what you really thought. She'll like that.' </p> <p>'Well, she - she was like complimentative? Everything we did, she complimented us on it? And I thought that was, like, nice.' </p> <p>'Did you have any negative feelings at all?' </p> <p>'No. Not really.' </p> <p>'So you like her?' </p> <p>'Well, I don't think she would, like, do anything bad. I don't know her a lot. I just met her. Like, she's obviously going to be nice when she first meets us.' </p> <p>'Of course. That's smart. Anything else?' </p> <p>Julia answers. 'When she said, \"Do you have a girlie thing?\" And then we said, \"Well, there might be some in Mom's bathroom.\" And she wasn't like embarrassed to say that?' </p> <p>I don't know why this pleases me so much. </p> <p>'She almost did say \"shit\" downstairs,' Julia says, 'but she said, \"Well, I can't say that around you?\"' </p> <p>Then Rachel rustles and squirms, and I can tell she wants to say something but wants me to ask her first. 'What, Rachel?' </p> <p>'I don't know. She was nice. And she acted like a kid, in a good way.' </p> <p>'What do you mean?' </p> <p>'She was fun.' </p> <p>'Anything else?' </p> <p>'She had a limo.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "She's 50 minutes late and I'm starting to walk toward the door when I see her. She's smaller and thinner and sadder than I expected from that hieratic movie-star face and the wild bad-girl spirit she projects on screen - the best bad girl in movies today. She looks beaten and dogged. I think about keeping on going because I'm pissed off and of course she doesn't recognise unfamous me, but then something in her beaten face stops me and I say, 'Angelina' and she looks at me, hesitates, remembers that she shouldn't stop because I might be a wacko and starts to keep going and by the time I say, 'It's me, John, I'm supposed to meet you', she's already figured it out and stopped in her tracks, defeated by all the little hesitations and revisions of decency and expediency. I don't remember what we say first, but a minute later she's saying she is sorry, really sorry, we should just give this up and I say, No, it's OK, and she says, No, it's not OK, nobody should be kept waiting for 50 minutes, why would you want to talk to me now? She's sorry but she also seems to be on the edge of flashing anger because I won't accept her being sorry and it's so quick and mercurial I feel very much like I'm dealing with a crazy person. Half of what she says I can't follow, it's in some private language about things that happened to her recently and she's so jittery and raw I say, Don't be sorry, I would have been mad before but I can see you're a suffering human being and it's not that big a deal. At some point she starts to cry - a tear wells in her eye and leaks down her cheek. We're standing here in the lobby of the Museum of Modern Art and I suggest we sit down in the sculpture garden, but she's convinced it's ruined and all her fault. She's very skinny and pale and is wearing no make-up, a few blotches on her face, and I get glimpses of her arms, which are marked with black tattoos and it's not two minutes in her presence before I check those long arms for tracks. Don't see any, but every time I step closer to her so I can get into normal human speaking range, she steps back six inches or a foot more than normal. Did she just smoke a joint? She's wearing black leather pants and a black T-shirt with white sweater fuzz all over it and I catch myself starting to say, I really loved your performance in Girl, Interrupted, but I stop myself because I hate that kind of gushing on principle and it seems particularly wrong right now, completely inadequate. She says she hasn't eaten all day and I ask a couple more times if she wants to get something to eat or to sit down and she clearly just wants to crawl out of her skin and her dad's been in his hotel for two days and she hasn't even had time to call him. I start telling her my now clearly useless idea for an interview based on an article in The Atlantic Monthly by Sue Erikson Bloland about being the daughter of a famous person and the associated distortions and how weird it was when her dad became the world's most famous child psychologist and successful, accomplished people would get strangely childlike in his company and I've got her attention now, she's calming down just listening to my voice, and I say, I thought maybe we could talk about that and she says, We're already talking about it and I feel the nervous antennae of her attention reaching out and twitching back and suddenly it just hits me that this whole thing is wrong and I find myself saying, Maybe you shouldn't be doing this. You don't need to be on magazine covers. Publicity isn't for everybody and maybe you should just not do this interview or any interview ever again. But that seems to set her on the edge of tears again and she tells me, No, it's all about communication - movies, magazines, it's all communication and that's important to her and she's almost pleading with me and it's so weird because even at the premiere last night, the premiere for The Bone Collector, the photographers told her brother to move out of the shot so they could get one of just famous her and her famous dad and it's obvious that even the memory gives her pain - she's all nerves and anything that touches the wrong spot stings. And I suggest again that maybe we should have a bite or something and she rubs her arms and looks this way and that and finally I just give her my card and say, 'That's my home number and you can call me or not call me, whatever, it's all good, and she's twisting and twisting my card into lint and saying how she's thinking maybe she doesn't even need acting, maybe she should just move to the country and have a kid and I think, For God's sake don't do that - thinking of the kid. And some instinct tells me that firmness and authority is the ticket so I say, This is the deal, you're getting back from LA on Thursday and that's when my wife leaves on vacation and I have to take care of the kids - she smiles at that - so if you decide to call, you have to give me some notice so I can get someone to baby-sit. And she says, What do you have and I say, Girls, and she asks ages and I tell her and the human moment seems to relax her and so I say, Hey, if you want, come up to my house and hang out with us and then she really smiles and says she'd like that. So we talk about where I live and how close it is to where she's buying her farmhouse and I get the feeling that even though she won't commit to a meal or a seat somewhere all I have to do is keep talking and she'll keep standing here forever. But people are streaming around us and I can't even use my tape recorder and frankly the whole thing is getting a little wearying, so finally I usher her to the door and outside she perks right up, spots a pretzel stand and gets one and we start walking. The food seems to steady her. The freedom of movement seems to steady her. She says a friend said something about fuck you or she said fuck you to the friend and I find her pretty hard to follow - some of it's coherent and some of it isn't even a little bit. We go up a few blocks and she says, Are you walking me somewhere or am I walking you somewhere. My office is two blocks back so I say, I'll walk you to the corner, and then when we get there I point in different directions and say - aware by now of how definite statements soothe her - You're going that way and I'm going that way, and she smiles and I lean in to kiss her on the cheek because I really do like her now and feel sorry for her and hope it all works out, and her return kiss catches me on the side of the mouth and then she flashes me the most beautiful smile I have ever seen - she's so grateful to be set free. She doesn't call, of course, but when I finally check in with her manager, the office person says she told them to give me her home number. Which is pleasing. But I don't know, I've been reading about female movie stars and this line of Marilyn Monroe's is stuck in my brain: 'Everybody wants a piece of you,' she said (and then fell to pieces). And James Mason said at Judy Garland's funeral that she gave so much so completely that 'she needed to be repaid, needed devotion and love beyond the resources of any of us'. And it makes me feel kind of sick because I know I wanted my little piece of Angelina, and wasn't I shocked and a little thrilled when she came apart in my hands? And if she did a Garland or a Monroe, which seems all too possible on the evidence so far, wouldn't I end up owning a pretty little piece of that? But what the hell, we all have a job to do. So I call the beautiful young movie star at home. She sounds sleepy but glad enough to chat and after a while I say, 'So, what about us? Do you want to do this thing?' She says she's going to be near my neighbourhood on Saturday with her dad and brother. She'll drop by around one, if that's all right. Saturday morning, I clean up. But not too much. Five minutes before one, she calls, I give directions to her driver and 30 minutes later a black stretch limo pulls into my driveway. I go down and shake hands with Angelina's dad, who introduces me to his son and the limo driver, and then they follow me up the garden path. Inside, Angelina's dad notices our dining-table chairs, which are in the middle of the room, and he smiles and asks who painted them. The kids answer - Rachel (who is nine) painted the one with the ladybird and the one with lots of drippy blue dots. Angelina's dad examines the kitchen cabinets my wife painted to cover up the 30-year-old stains and says he always wished he had the nerve to do something like that and I tell him poverty was the mother of that invention and I'm thinking what a sweet and almost childlike quality he has and how unusual it is in a movie star, yet how consistent with the characters he used to play. I'm also very aware that he's checking me out. He must be worried about this whole weird thing of his daughter visiting the media beast in its lair at this obviously sensitive stage in her life. Some of this I process only later. Because he is, after all, Jon Voight. And it's a bit of a job trying not to be distracted from my normal-guy routine by his undeniable Jon Voightness. Then Angelina asks the kids to show her their room and the three of them run down the stairs and disappear. Her dad and her brother go out for a walk. It's almost two and the kids haven't eaten. I make some noodle soup and dish out the Greek salad and when Angelina comes back upstairs she sits down and picks at her food - she says her dad was trying to force-feed her in the car and I can believe it, she's so skinny. I file the statement away in the part of my brain where I'm storing the Jon-Voight-is-worried-about-his-daughter material. Then I ask her if she wants some coffee or tea and she goes into completely incomprehensible story about her marriage and tea and how that was a sign of what was wrong because her ex-husband likes teapots with a whistle and she couldn't stand the whistle and so they always forgot that the tea was boiling and for some reason this meant they ended up crawling into the kitchen to get the teapot off the stove. Was the kitchen too small? Did they think it was going to blow up? Was it hurling so much steam around? I never quite get it. And I try. I am a professional reporter and do my best to dig it out of her and each answer is more tangled than the original story. No, not tangled, the right word is vaporous. Her sentences are like sheets of mist that start to evaporate the second they hit the open air. Meanwhile, she keeps picking at her salad in that distracted way, as if she isn't even aware she's eating. Finally, I take away the plates and Angelina says maybe we should get the tape recorder and do the interview thing - although she'd really rather play Nintendo with the kids. So I say maybe we should do that, play Nintendo, tape recorders being so alienating and all. What I don't say is that I'm afraid transcribing a tape of her talking will be like trying to unzip fog. But she insists, so I get the tape recorder and we wander downstairs and end up sitting on my daughter's bed. She's cross-legged, holding her heels in her hands under the Alanis Morissette poster and the fluorescent stars. 'So tell me, did you read the article?' 'Did I read the article?' 'In The Atlantic. That I gave you.' 'Oh, no. My brother has it.' I just say oh and let it slide, but she starts to explain that her brother got upset by the article and took it away from her so she wouldn't see it. Once again I have a lot of trouble following her. This is what she says: 'That was very - how did he put it? I think he was upset. Yeah. Very upset. I don't know if he was - he had a weird reaction, I think. It's a weird reaction to see those things, because they're pointed out. And we were both there when he pointed it out. I don't know why he took it. Or if he got rid of it because it upset him. Or - there's a reason we didn't want to talk about it. So obviously it was quite a strong article.' Like I said, I haven't got a clue what she's talking about. 'Hmm. Interesting,' I say. 'Mysterious, but interesting.' 'It was just one of those things that was - I started to read it. And I can see why some of that stuff that's in the title sometimes can - and not even me. But it's like the two of us now and oh shit, you know.' 'So that's like a thing that -' 'Hovering. The whole parent thing, and -' 'The parent-fame thing?' 'Um, yeah, it is and it isn't. It is in a great way. Because, you know, we talk.' And she goes on. Looking over the transcript now, after I've come to know her, it's very clear to me that it was all my fault, that I was suffering from a failure of imagination and trying to understand her as if she were normal when the only way to understand her is to crawl inside her language as if it were a complex modern poem and link up the elusive meanings and let go the things you don't understand. But let's get there by steps. The next thing she talks about is her father and how she loves him yet feels his image hovering above her, because no matter how far you've gone it's always like you've had help, whether you got help or not. Then she jumps off that train and into the subject of a recent photo shoot, which seems to have become for her a symbol of all that is wrong with being a movie star in the modern world. She tried to explain that she didn't want to be in lingerie or anything of a clich\u00e9d sexpot nature, but they threw in some lacy camisoles, 'which to me is verging on lingerie,' and they probably were hoping to get a little bra showing or see-through and it was just generally a disappointment and she's always tried to be a good little celebrity but she's getting really tired of it. Gently, I suggest that sex is a good thing and having seen a fair number of her previous photo spreads, they're not exactly lust-free zones. 'Like the Rolling Stone cover - you were so glammed up.' 'I wasn't all glammed up. The cover, I was totally red-faced from crying.' 'Really?' 'Because I felt like a whore.' Talking about it, she gets upset all over again. 'And I told him that. I told the photographer. And it's not Rolling Stone 's fault, and it's not, you know, the wardrobe woman's fault or anything. It's - the photographer just had his idea of me being - and I talked to him before and I said, you know, if they wanted to get me free or wild, that - but, you know, they kept saying which - the same as yesterday. I kept saying to them, you know, that I just wanted to - whatever they - just to show me what they want.' At this point, I realise that the teapot is probably boiling and since we don't have a whistle either, it'll just keep on boiling. But I don't say anything about it because I want to see if she'll remember and I'm trying to concentrate on figuring out the point she's trying to make. 'And they would kind of say, Well, we want you to be happy, we want to relate to you. And you have to say, It's not me. I don't wear - it's a nice suit with shoulder pads and black leather pants, but I'm on a couch, looking like I'm just lounging or I've got smudgy eye make-up so it's more like I look slightly fucked up, and it's kind of the idea of, what are you getting across to people? Are you getting across to people that this is my idea of how a woman is sexual? Or if I'm being an actor, you can put me in dress-up, then that's me. But it's the idea of just acting like you're just hanging out with some gorgeous gown on, just hangin' out -' Finally I get it. And maybe it's because pushing through the word mists was so much work and maybe it's because she's so sensitive and lovely sitting here on my daughter's bed under the grrrl-queen posters and fluorescent stars, but getting it seems like a glorious miracle. 'It's like a phoniness,' I say. She shakes her head. 'It's just the idea of - what is it we're sharing with people, you know? You think, as an actor, or any kind of an artist, that you're kind of contributing something. And you don't always have to be doing that, but definitely not doing something where it's going the opposite direction. You know?' I nod, but I'm lost again. 'And all women do have a different sense of sexuality, or sense of fun, or sense of like what's sexy or cool or rough or - you know, I like to be maybe cleaner. Maybe it would be nice for someone my age to not see someone in like some see-through tank top and jeans, but to see them in a cashmere sweater and slacks. Maybe they'd go in that direction.' Oh! Now I've got it. She's talking about social responsibility. Imagine that! This beautiful young movie star is sitting here in her black leather pants talking about social responsibility and telling the truth and how hard it is to refuse - I'm getting it, I'm getting it - to present some glamourised prefab image that further betrays our inner selves and leads the vast army of lost searchers out there to more loss of self and over-commodification and more desperate efforts, to buy or copy or otherwise consume all the pretty things we jam into the hole we used to call the soul here in the Supermarket of the Damned! Yeah! Go, baby! 'And that's why we look at magazines, to see if we like different things, you know? So then you feel like -' 'These are the options.' 'Really - this is your presentation of what I feel is sexy. This is what I feel is fun, this is what I feel is interesting, and this makes me feel angular and wild and - you know?' Yes! Angular and wild, exactly! 'I see,' I say. 'I got it.' Man, this feels good. If she'd set out to win me over, she couldn't possibly have picked a better tack than this peculiarly artless charm. It's not until much later that I get cynical enough to consider the possibility that her antennae picked that up somehow and that she might be playing to that. 'The tea!' I say. And we both jump off the bed and run upstairs and while I get the mugs and stuff, she keeps talking about how the Rolling Stone guys were so disappointed because they thought she was so wild and free and I think of her in Gia, panthering around in the same black leather pants I just followed up the stairs and she says yeah, people seem to think that since she did a film about a bisexual junkie supermodel, that somehow translates into her stripping down to a G-string in magazines. 'Do you want milk or sugar?' I ask. 'Mmm. A little bit.' I give her both. Then we sit back down at the dining table. 'You were talking about how your dad and you have had these discussions about how real to be in interviews,' I say. 'How much truth to tell. And I'm not sure how much truth to tell either. I was reading about Marilyn Monroe the other night and she said, \"Everybody always wants a piece of you.\" And I've always felt a little uncomfortable with that movie-star thing because that's what you do, you try to take a piece of them.' She nods, but then she goes and disagrees with me. In fact, she says that it upsets her when actors talk that way because she gets so much from being an actor. And it's not even giving yourself or allowing yourself to be taken so much as it is throwing yourself open. And if people accept that, then it lets you put the pieces together. And as she talks about this I realise that either she's getting more lucid or I'm starting to understand her private language better. 'But Jon and I do have this - we've talked about it before, because I'm really outspoken and I think he's been worried about me.' 'Jon being your dad?' 'Jon being my dad, yeah. I've talked about, you know, everything. And just being really outspoken about my marriage and, you know, being with women, and they will take it and turn it into different things. So he's wanting me to kind of be quiet. A lot of people wanted me to be quiet during Gia , to not say if I'd ever done any drugs, or had ever slept with a woman, which to me was being totally hypocritical. If I had, and if I could identify with the story that much more, and really saw a beautiful thing in another woman - so I thought it was nice to share what I had experienced, because I thought it was great - I didn't see why it was so bad.' One thing she's learned along the way is that when people are cruel or arrogant or cold, the 'missing elements' affect their work and when she watches them on film she sees them missing a beat here and there because they're not really listening. 'That's the reason for - that's the reason we kind of exist,' she says. 'It's like Our Job. To give to each other. And learn from each other. To capture moments of people. So it's like it's really strange to have somebody ignore the obvious human being right in front of them.' Right around here is where I really start to feel a little flush of shame at the memory of my conversations just last week with friends who told me they'd seen her on chat shows and she was 'not a good talker' or 'wacky' or worse and knowing that's probably exactly what I would have said if I was judging her as a performance of a person instead of this actual human being sitting across the table from me. And I say, 'But you know, it's funny, when I first met you at the museum I - I really thought you were like -' 'Losing my mind.' I laugh. 'Losing your mind, yeah.' 'I was disturbed,' she says, 'Just seeing you and seeing that you had kind of accepted it somehow, even though I could tell you were very angry, you were somehow like, That's the way it is.' She laughs. 'You know? Somehow you adjusted to it.' She laughed again, maybe a little nervously this time. 'You know? You don't have an ego about it or something. Which was so horrifying, to think that that would be OK.' I'm feeling it now myself - she's making me feel it with her own decency and regret - the sadness of all the adjustments of pride and need and financial desperation and the long history of rejection and humiliation that turned me into the kind of guy who would cool his heels in a museum lobby for 50 minutes waiting for a semi-famous beautiful girl. 'Wow,' I say. 'You know?' 'Yeah.' 'So.' 'Yeah.' 'So yeah.' After the limo pulls her out of my driveway, I'm so full of good energy. And I don't think it's just because she was beautiful and famous, although there's no way you can get around that - if she were an ugly guy, there's no way I'd have bothered to read her mists, much less get so smug about my fabulous mist-reading abilities. But that said, there's still something pure about her. And it felt like a gift. It felt as soft and innocent as one of my kids' butterfly kisses, that thing they do with their eyelashes against your cheek. And later when I watch Midnight Cowboy I realise that Angelina's dad has exactly the same pure spirit - there was so much hunger and tenderness and dumb love and joy just bursting out of him that it wasn't a performance at all but the voice that is great within us (as a poetry anthology called it) just shining through. It reminds me of what Pauline Kael, the celebrated film critic, said about actors, that when you get past the dialogue and the silly plots, it's always actors who are the most alive and fresh. Some more than others. And it's almost always the ones who have that wild innocent purity - the Monroes, the Garlands. The ones who 'break'. And then it hits me - of course. I get my tape recorder and summon my girls. 'I want to ask you something,' I say. 'When Angelina came, you guys went off with her and disappeared. What did you talk about?' Julie answers first. 'Um, well first we went downstairs, and she said everything was really cool and like all colourful and like wild and stuff. And then we went to the laundry room, which was all messy, and she said, \"I love this. It's so messy.\"' 'If you can remember exactly what she said, that's good. Exact words are important.' 'OK. And so then we took her to the other room? Our new room? She said it was going to be great. And then we went to Mom's office, and she was like shocked by the masks and said, \"Who did that?\" And I said, \"I did.\" And she was like, \"How did you do that?\" And I said, \"With papier-mch\u00e9.\" And she said, \"That's awesome.\" And then we went to your office, and we turned on the picture of your brain and I said, \"That's Daddy's brain,\" and she said, \"Eeew, gross.\" And then we went into your bedroom.' 'Wait a second. Rachel, what is it?' 'We went to your room before we went to the office.' 'That's good. Accuracy is important.' 'And then we went into your room,' Julia continues, 'and she - she liked the red walls. She said, \"It's so cozy.\" And she saw some more of our art and she said, \"You guys are so good. You must get that from your mom.\" And we said, \"Well, I don't know. We probably do.\" A-a-a-a-n-n-d, that's it.' 'Anything you remember, Rachel? I'm gonna put this in, so, you know, think.' 'Um. She also said she really like Julia's poster. That Beck one? She said it was cool. And she likes him too.' 'So what'd you think of her?' 'I thought she was nice,' Julia says. 'Nice is not very descriptive. Tell me more. And don't necessarily be nice. Say what you really thought. She'll like that.' 'Well, she - she was like complimentative? Everything we did, she complimented us on it? And I thought that was, like, nice.' 'Did you have any negative feelings at all?' 'No. Not really.' 'So you like her?' 'Well, I don't think she would, like, do anything bad. I don't know her a lot. I just met her. Like, she's obviously going to be nice when she first meets us.' 'Of course. That's smart. Anything else?' Julia answers. 'When she said, \"Do you have a girlie thing?\" And then we said, \"Well, there might be some in Mom's bathroom.\" And she wasn't like embarrassed to say that?' I don't know why this pleases me so much. 'She almost did say \"shit\" downstairs,' Julia says, 'but she said, \"Well, I can't say that around you?\"' Then Rachel rustles and squirms, and I can tell she wants to say something but wants me to ask her first. 'What, Rachel?' 'I don't know. She was nice. And she acted like a kid, in a good way.' 'What do you mean?' 'She was fun.' 'Anything else?' 'She had a limo.'",
