      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In 1964, in New York, Samuel Beckett, the great poet of silence, met Buster Keaton, the great comic actor of the silent era. The playwright greatly admired Keaton's work and had reputedly watched his classic film, The General, more than half a dozen times. Keaton, on the other hand, was baffled by Beckett's plays and had previously turned down the role of Lucky in the first American stage production of Waiting for Godot. Perhaps because he had not worked in over 30 years and needed the money, the ageing actor agreed, without much enthusiasm, to play the principal role in a short film written by Beckett called, simply, Film. </p> <p>Though, as Anthony Cronin puts it in his Beckett biography, The Last Modernist, there was an 'obvious affinity between the expressionless, enigmatic actor and the expressionless, enigmatic writer', their initial meeting was an unmitigated disaster. Beckett arrived at Keaton's hotel, to find him watching a baseball game and drinking beer. Cronin takes up the story: 'Beckett, finding himself in the unusual position of having to make the running, ventured a few general words about his admiration for Keaton's work. When these petered out, everybody sat in silence while Keaton, seemingly unperturbed - though because of his famous mask, nobody could be sure - continued to drink his beer and watch the game. Every now and then Beckett, almost like somebody meeting Samuel Beckett for the first time, would venture a few words, to which Keaton would respond at best in monosyllables.' In a sentence that could easily pass for a stage direction from a Beckett play, Cronin concludes: 'The minutes passed, the situation seemed to get more harrowing and hopeless and the silences to become more interminable.'</p> <p>And yet, despite the author's misgivings and the actor's bewilderment, the almost silent Film - Keaton's character, O, utters only one word, a whispered 'Sssh!' - was shot over three weeks in the sweltering heat of a New York summer. Its typically Beckettian theme concerns a man who attempts to achieve a state of non-being by fleeing from the perception of others. Keaton's stone face, which had formerly been his cinematic signature, is glimpsed only once in the final scene when he awakes from a short sleep to find himself surprised by the camera. Film, because of its brevity and its obtuse subject matter, proved almost impossible to market though, ironically, it did play as part of a Keaton season in the following year's New York Film Festival where it was greeted with what Cronin calls 'a resentful silence' that was broken by the chorus of loud booing that accompanied the credits. It has seldom been shown since and predictably has attained cult status among both Beckett and Keaton aficionados. Until now, too, Beckett's more famous dramatic works, including the epochal Waiting for Godot, have resisted the often uneasy journey from the stage to the screen, not least because of the legendary protectiveness of the Beckett estate - in effect his nephew, Edward.</p> <p>A few years back, a startling stage production of Footfalls, directed by Deborah Warner and starring Fiona Shaw, was pulled after only two performances because it contravened the letter of Beckett's always precise stage directions. It seems surprising, then, that the estate has agreed to allow the filming of all 19 Beckett plays, a project that is currently nearing completion under the guiding hand of Michael Colgan, artistic director of Dublin's Gate Theatre and long-time Beckett devotee. The results, funded by the Irish state broadcasting company, RTE, to the tune of \u00a34.5million, will be screened at a special gala event in Dublin next spring, and broadcast later on Channel 4. </p> <p> Thus far, Colgan and his co-producer, Alan Maloney, have attracted cinema directors of the calibre of Neil Jordan, who has employed Julianne Moore's mouth to fill the screen for the duration of Not I, and Anthony Minghella, who has filmed Play. More intriguing still is the teaming of director David Mamet with Harold Pinter in an acting role, alongside the late Sir John Gielgud, in Catastrophe. 'That's an exciting prospect,' enthuses Colgan, 'because you could argue that without Beckett, Pinter would not have written what he did in the way that he did, and likewise, without Pinter, Mamet's work as we know it would not have existed. There's a definite and definable lineage there.' </p> <p>Other directors include Conor McPherson, writer of The Weir, who has chosen Endgame, Michael Lindsay-Hogg who is currently filming Waiting for Godot on location in the Irish border town of Castleblaney, and Atom Egoyan, who has finished Krapp's Last Tape, featuring John Hurt in a reprise of the role that brought in packed houses in a recent West End run. </p> <p> In a brave move that may cause further trepidation to Beckett purists, Colgan has also employed younger directors with neither a theatre nor writing background, including Dubliner, Damien O'Donnell, who made his name with East Is East, and 26-year-old guerrilla filmmaker Enda Hughes, best known for his low-budget, high-concept first feature, The Eliminator. 'The Beckett estate has been incredibly supportive throughout,' says Colgan. 'Samuel Beckett's nephew, Edward, saw Damien's film of What Where and thought it had more of an impact than it ever had on stage.' </p> <p>Damien Hirst, whose previous excursions into film have included a Blur video, has been chosen to direct Breath, a 45-second piece featuring no visible characters, a rubbish-strewn landscape, amplified breathing and a single cry, which will no doubt be read by many of his detractors as an unconscious comment on the current state of Young British Art.</p> <p>'It is important to understand from the outset that we are making films and not versions of the plays,' stresses Colgan, the only director in the world to have staged all 19 plays together, first in Dublin in 1991, and last year at the Barbican's Beckett Festival. 'That said, though, there are strict rules governing the project: the stage instructions remain sacrosanct, and there can be no gender bending of characters or cutting of lines. We have to be true to the spirit of Beckett who, of course, was the most careful writer in the world. He was also, though, a very imagistic writer. Even if they don't remember the name of the plays, people tend to remember the images - those guys in the sacks, the people buried up to their necks, the characters in the dustbins. He created simple, sparse, strong images that stick in the mind. I think we need people of the calibre of Neil Jordan or David Mamet to interpret those images for a wider audience because Beckett is unique among modern writers in that he is both monumental but also incredibly neglected.'</p> <p>Anthony Minghella was also drawn to the idea of Beckett's work reaching a wider, newer audience through the medium of film. Like Atom Egoyan, he cites the playwright as his biggest formative influence. 'I jumped at the chance to do Breath because it was the first piece I ever directed back when I was a member of Hull University's drama department in 1976. I was obsessed by the great man for five or six years in my early twenties. I'm sure there are students of mine who can recall being tormented by my Beckett quizzes. I was a total Beckett anorak back then. A lot of what I learnt about dramatic writing came from that period of entrancement.' Play features the heads of three figures, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, Juliet Stevenson and Alan Rickman, protruding from three identical grey urns, their 'faces so lost to age', Beckett wrote in his directions, 'as to seem almost part of the urns'. Minghella has taken the liberty of setting the three principals amid a host of other mute, urn-imprisoned characters in a semi-hallucinatory landscape that could be either post-apocalyptic or purgatorial. They each recite the banal details of various past encounters and indiscretions in rapid-fire, but toneless, salvoes of speech, which, in places, Minghella has created from the splicing together of several different takes. </p> <p> 'I wanted to create a cubist film,' he says, 'where the size and shape is constantly changing, where the audience's attention is constantly drawn to the mechanisms of film. You can hear every camera movement, every focus pull. You are forced to feel the presence of the camera, like you would feel the stage light that shines on them when they speak in a theatrical production.' </p> <p>It is this kind of poetic fidelity that also illuminates Enda Hughes's remarkable reading of Act Without Words II. Here, the 'frieze effect' stipulated by Beckett to frame the 'low narrow platform at back of stage, violently lit in its entire length' has become the borders of a Cinemascope film strip, grainy and brightly flickering. Against this created background, the two actors have been filmed movement by movement, one frame at a time, to produce a cinematic effect akin to human animation.</p> <p> 'Beckett was so concerned with form that I think he would have employed the mechanics of film in the same inventive way that he employed lighting and the stage itself, as presences, even characters in the drama. That's what I wanted to try and do myself.' </p> <p> Given that Hughes is from the post-Spielberg rather than post-Beckett school of directors, I wondered if he had been initially awed by the great man's reputation. 'Not really. I had never studied the plays but I'd seen a few performed when I was growing up and instinctively connected with his view of the world which is pessimistic and strangely humorous. He's certainly a presence, though. It's as if he's looking over your shoulder while you work. All the time, I kept thinking, would he have liked this? That was really the only guiding principle, alongside trying to be true to the essence of the work.' </p> <p>In Hughes's film, the spirits of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin loom large also, as the two characters emerge from their sacks to mime the mundane rituals of daily life, one stoically and sadly, the other jauntily and with exaggerated vigour. In playing with the conventions of both Beckett and silent film, Hughes has created a truly contemporary take on both. I think Sam - and Buster - would have approved. </p> <p><strong>Beckett on film</strong></p> <p> What Where (12 mins) directed by Damien O'Donnell, starring Sean McGinley, Gary Lewis </p> <p>Endgame (84 mins) Conor McPherson, starring Michael Gambon, David Thewlis </p> <p>Breath (45 secs) Damien Hirst </p> <p>Not I (14 mins) Neil Jordan, starring Julianne Moore </p> <p>Act Without Words I (16 mins) Karel Reisz, starring Sean Foley </p> <p>Act Without Words II (10 mins) </p> <p>Enda Hughes, starring Marcello Magni, Pat Kinevane </p> <p>Krapp's Last Tape (58 mins) Atom Egoyan, starring John Hurt </p> <p>Catastrophe (84 mins) David Mamet, starring Harold Pinter, John Gielgud, Rebecca Pidgeon</p> <p>Footfalls (29 mins) Walter Asmus, starring Susan Fitzgerald </p> <p>Play (16 mins) Anthony Minghella, starring Alan Rickman, Kristin Scott Thomas, Juliet Stevenson </p> <p>A Piece of Monologue (19 mins) Robin Lefevre, starring Stephen Brennan</p> <p>Rockaby (14 mins) Richard Eyre, starring Penelope Wilton </p> <p>Happy Days (79 mins) Patricia Rozema, starring Rosaleen Linehan, Richard Johnson </p> <p>Rough for Theatre I (19 mins) </p> <p>Kieron J.

Minghella has taken the liberty of setting the three principals amid a host of other mute, urn-imprisoned characters in a semi-hallucinatory landscape that could be either post-apocalyptic or purgatorial. They each recite the banal details of various past encounters and indiscretions in rapid-fire, but toneless, salvoes of speech, which, in places, Minghella has created from the splicing together of several different takes. 'I wanted to create a cubist film,' he says, 'where the size and shape is constantly changing, where the audience's attention is constantly drawn to the mechanisms of film. You can hear every camera movement, every focus pull. You are forced to feel the presence of the camera, like you would feel the stage light that shines on them when they speak in a theatrical production.' It is this kind of poetic fidelity that also illuminates Enda Hughes's remarkable reading of Act Without Words II. Here, the 'frieze effect' stipulated by Beckett to frame the 'low narrow platform at back of stage, violently lit in its entire length' has become the borders of a Cinemascope film strip, grainy and brightly flickering. Against this created background, the two actors have been filmed movement by movement, one frame at a time, to produce a cinematic effect akin to human animation. 'Beckett was so concerned with form that I think he would have employed the mechanics of film in the same inventive way that he employed lighting and the stage itself, as presences, even characters in the drama. That's what I wanted to try and do myself.' Given that Hughes is from the post-Spielberg rather than post-Beckett school of directors, I wondered if he had been initially awed by the great man's reputation. 'Not really. I had never studied the plays but I'd seen a few performed when I was growing up and instinctively connected with his view of the world which is pessimistic and strangely humorous. He's certainly a presence, though. It's as if he's looking over your shoulder while you work. All the time, I kept thinking, would he have liked this? That was really the only guiding principle, alongside trying to be true to the essence of the work.' In Hughes's film, the spirits of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin loom large also, as the two characters emerge from their sacks to mime the mundane rituals of daily life, one stoically and sadly, the other jauntily and with exaggerated vigour. In playing with the conventions of both Beckett and silent film, Hughes has created a truly contemporary take on both. I think Sam - and Buster - would have approved.

      "body": "<p>The England camp was disappointed last night. But when you consider that their disappointment stemmed from their inability to force Pakistan to follow on, it revealed how far the aspirations of the touring party have risen over the last four days. As soon as Yousuf Youhana flicked Andy Caddick down to long leg to take the score to 281 for eight the chances of England winning this Test plummeted. </p> <p>Since Youhana and his stubborn partner Saqlain Mushtaq then proceeded to bat out the last hour those chances have receded further. A draw seems inevitable. </p> <p>Even so this has been a sterling effort by the England side. They had one significant slice of luck when they won the toss but since that first morning they have dominated a game that has confounded pundits and players alike. </p> <p>Beforehand the general assumption was that this match would be over in four days. Well, so far 18 wickets have fallen. </p> <p>The ball has turned but not venomously. The pitch generates plenty of dust yet refuses to misbehave for seamers who might have anticipated uneven bounce by now. Instead the ball doubles declutches on landing before waiting conveniently for the bat to be laid upon it. The fin ger-spinners have toiled and eventually been rewarded. The two main wrist spinners have so far propelled 64 overs without taking a wicket. The pitch is too slow for them to prosper. In any case neither Mushtaq Ahmed nor Ian Salisbury have bowled well. </p> <p>England were valiant if not flawless in the field as the home side moved from 119-2 to 333-8. The greatest excitement came when Pakistan lost their eighth wicket with eight runs still required to save the follow-on but Saqlain stood firm. </p> <p>Craig White was again outstanding - easily the most penetrative and the most used of the pace-bowlers. Now there are no worries about his temperament, only his body. At different times he felt a twinge in his dodgy hamstring and a burning sensation between his shoulderblades but he soldiered on and was able to reverse-swing the ball to far greater effect than his colleagues. Ashley Giles's stamina and control were admirable in his second Test match. For Pakistan Youhana, the fifth non-Muslim to represent them, calmly shepherded his side past 280, batting four hours for his unbeaten 77. </p> <p>For most of the morning session the prospect of being able to enforce the follow-on seemed remote. Nasser Hussain has used five bowlers within the first hour and none of them caused any alarm for Inzamam and Salim Elahi. Inzamam's judgment of length reminded us why he's a batsman close to genius despite his lumbering brain. Maybe that's why he's allowed to spend most of Pakistan's training sessions in a comfy wicker chair. He soon seized upon two fractionally short deliveries from Giles and despatched them to the mid-wicket boundary. Elahi was less certain but soon surpassed his highest Test score, a modest 17. </p> <p>They had two moments of concern. Caddick's first ball delivered after Giles and Salisbury had shared seven overs from the pavilion end thudded into Inzamam's front pad. This prompted a very good shout but umpire Riazzudin kept his finger down as he had done throughout the English innings. Caddick refrained from sharing his obvious frustration. </p> <p>Soon after Elahi, facing Giles, popped a catch towards silly point off the face of his bat. But Hussain was so close and so intent on unnerving the batsman by his proximity that he could not hold on to the ball. Hussain as ever was prominent, taking time to set the field meticulously and to feel his back which is obviously misbehaving. He was having treatment when the first of a flurry of wickets fell just before lunch (interestingly Graham Thorpe took charge in his absence). First Elahi dragged an attempted drive against White onto his stumps; then the prized wicket of Inzamam was taken by Giles. The flighted delivery outside leg stump turned sharply, brushed Inzamam's back pad before hitting the wicket. White then snapped up the 18-year-old debutant Qaiser Abbas who drove away from his body to give a simple catch to Graeme Hick in the gully and Pakistan were rocking. </p> <p>After the break Moin Khan scurried around for 17 runs until he was surprised - like the rest of us - when umpire Riazzudin raised his finger in response to an lbw shout from Caddick. Abdur Razzaq also looked aggrieved to be given lbw padding up by umpire Hair 15 overs later but if he studies the replay of White's in-swinging delivery he will discover that he and not Hair made the misjudgment. When Wasim Akram clipped an innocuous delivery from Giles straight into the hands of White at short mid-wicket in the next over saving the follow-on was no longer a formality. </p> <p>Four runs were still needed at the tea interval but Saqlain, Pakistan's hero in this match was resolute while Youhana remained utterly secure. Indeed England rarely threatened to take a wicket in the final session of 90 minutes. The advent of the new ball did nothing to enhance the penetration of their attack. </p> <p>Yet this had been a spir ited performance by England; they never lost their zest in the field and the pace-bowlers kept running in alongside Giles, refusing to be cowed by such an unresponsive surface. One of them, Darren Gough, may be miffed that he was given only 10 overs in the day but of greater concern was the bowling of Salisbury. </p> <p>He was allowed only 11 overs yesterday on a pitch where the ball was turning, albeit very slowly, and five of those were after the follow-on was saved and the day was creeping to a close. Hussain felt compelled to position fielders at deep point and deep mid-wicket whenever Salisbury was bowling to guard against the bad ball. This restricted his attacking option and prevented him from building up any pressure since so many easy singles were available. With Salisbury untrustworthy England's tour party looks unbalanced. Another spinning alternative would be handy (goodness knows who? One from the old triumvirate of Croft, Such or Tufnell, I suppose). Otherwise the first four days of Test cricket in Pakistan have been unusually heartening.</p>",

Maybe that's why he's allowed to spend most of Pakistan's training sessions in a comfy wicker chair. He soon seized upon two fractionally short deliveries from Giles and despatched them to the mid-wicket boundary. Elahi was less certain but soon surpassed his highest Test score, a modest 17. They had two moments of concern. Caddick's first ball delivered after Giles and Salisbury had shared seven overs from the pavilion end thudded into Inzamam's front pad. This prompted a very good shout but umpire Riazzudin kept his finger down as he had done throughout the English innings. Caddick refrained from sharing his obvious frustration. Soon after Elahi, facing Giles, popped a catch towards silly point off the face of his bat. But Hussain was so close and so intent on unnerving the batsman by his proximity that he could not hold on to the ball. Hussain as ever was prominent, taking time to set the field meticulously and to feel his back which is obviously misbehaving. He was having treatment when the first of a flurry of wickets fell just before lunch (interestingly Graham Thorpe took charge in his absence). First Elahi dragged an attempted drive against White onto his stumps; then the prized wicket of Inzamam was taken by Giles. The flighted delivery outside leg stump turned sharply, brushed Inzamam's back pad before hitting the wicket. White then snapped up the 18-year-old debutant Qaiser Abbas who drove away from his body to give a simple catch to Graeme Hick in the gully and Pakistan were rocking. After the break Moin Khan scurried around for 17 runs until he was surprised - like the rest of us - when umpire Riazzudin raised his finger in response to an lbw shout from Caddick. Abdur Razzaq also looked aggrieved to be given lbw padding up by umpire Hair 15 overs later but if he studies the replay of White's in-swinging delivery he will discover that he and not Hair made the misjudgment. When Wasim Akram clipped an innocuous delivery from Giles straight into the hands of White at short mid-wicket in the next over saving the follow-on was no longer a formality. Four runs were still needed at the tea interval but Saqlain, Pakistan's hero in this match was resolute while Youhana remained utterly secure. Indeed England rarely threatened to take a wicket in the final session of 90 minutes. The advent of the new ball did nothing to enhance the penetration of their attack. Yet this had been a spir ited performance by England; they never lost their zest in the field and the pace-bowlers kept running in alongside Giles, refusing to be cowed by such an unresponsive surface. One of them, Darren Gough, may be miffed that he was given only 10 overs in the day but of greater concern was the bowling of Salisbury. He was allowed only 11 overs yesterday on a pitch where the ball was turning, albeit very slowly, and five of those were after the follow-on was saved and the day was creeping to a close. Hussain felt compelled to position fielders at deep point and deep mid-wicket whenever Salisbury was bowling to guard against the bad ball. This restricted his attacking option and prevented him from building up any pressure since so many easy singles were available. With Salisbury untrustworthy England's tour party looks unbalanced. Another spinning alternative would be handy (goodness knows who? One from the old triumvirate of Croft, Such or Tufnell, I suppose). Otherwise the first four days of Test cricket in Pakistan have been unusually heartening.",

      "body": "<p>Taxi drivers in Las Vegas loathe Comdex. The high-earning geek set who converge upon the gambling oasis for their annual industry shindig are not the strongest of tippers. The drivers have a joke about the conference attendees. </p> <p>'Comdex people come here with $20 and one white shirt and don't change either all week,' said John Di Lamo, a taxi driver. He reels off examples of stingy techies, usually at the show on expenses. One young exec negotiated a $6 million deal in the back of the cab but tipped him just 80 cents. </p> <p>Volatility in the value of their share options may partly explain such thriftiness - at one point during the show, the Nasdaq index slipped below 3,000 points. </p> <p>But the vicissitudes of stock markets have done little to quell enthusiasm among delegates. Last year dotcoms held centre stage as the starting guns fired on an astonishing five-month rally. Subsequent experience suggests that some investors would have had a better return from the slot machines at Caesar's Palace. </p> <p>The racy bets this year were on wireless and networking technologies, and preferably combinations of the two. </p> <p>Perhaps the recent addition of a half-size Eiffel Tower to Las Vegas's casino district helped focus US companies on wireless technologies traditionally dominated by Europe. The busiest booths sported an array of such mobile gadgetry. Those promoting Palm Pilots, the similar Handspring Visor, and Ericsson mobile phones, were packed. </p> <p>Delegates, all employed in the technology sector, were easily worked into a lather over the prospect of winning T-shirts, baseball caps and pens. Surely their share options haven't fallen that far? </p> <p>At times it felt more like a university freshers' fair than the foremost convention of America's most important industry. </p> <p>But there is one major difference - money, and stacks of it. Las Vegas is the perfect location for the meeting of an industry which, despite recent turbulence, is awash with cash. Limousines seemed more numerous than taxis. The Pyramids, the Arc de Triomphe, the Rialto Bridge, volcanos, sharks, tigers and lions were all there. EDS, the software services company, spent $6 million on its Comdex presence. 'The digital economy rocks!' shouted its booth. EDS tried to prove this by hiring out pop diva Macy Gray. She sang to assorted minions of the new economy in a converted hangar at Las Vegas airport. </p> <p>A performance which can only be described as 'National Semiconductor - the musical' in the Comdex north hall took up this theme. One song featured lyrics such as 'Our market is growing so fast/The future is here to last, at Nat-ion-aal' and 'from personal devices to TV news/National is making it to use/we're freeing people from the PC'. </p> <p>This 'tyranny' of the personal computer was a recurring theme during the conference. In part this reflects the Microsoft factor - it is the Manchester United of the tech world: disliked by hardcore geeks but nonetheless extremely successful. </p> <p>Historically, some conflicts have been about land and others about ideology but for these guys it boils down to the thorny issue of where you store your 'apps' - either locally on a PC, or on a central device accessed by more nimble network computers. </p> <p>The clearest manifestation of this was Microsoft's escalation of the war of words with Oracle and its charismatic chief executive, Larry Ellison. </p> <p>'Larry's been talking about ideas that have gone nowhere for years. How long has he been talking about the [network computer]? Six years, seven years? Where did it go? Nowhere,' said Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive. </p> <p>'You're considered a dead company if you write applications for the PC,' said Ellison, before referring to Microsoft's new Tablet PC concept as irrelevant 'pen computing'. He also hinted that he may take on Bill Clinton after his presidential term finishes in January. </p> <p>But Microsoft spin-meisters had the best of it. They handed out mugs to people attending Ellison's speech, which claimed that Oracle salesman offer a $1m discount when trying to secure business from Microsoft customers. </p> <p>'When Oracle salesman pitches $5m of overpriced software, simply glance at the mug,' it reads. 'Oracle salesman spots mug, offers 20 per cent discount.' </p> <p>If that upset Ellison, then he was delighted to hear that he may be the model for a character in the forthcoming Charlie's Angels movie. Tim Curry plays a wealthy tech-exec with a penchant for fast cars and Japanese-style houses. Ellison only expressed disappointment that action star Steven Seagal wasn't playing 'him'. </p> <p>Back at the exhibition, film imagery was being used extensively to inject an air of excitement into attempts to sell graphics cards, DVD drives and even earphones. </p> <p>Canadian graphics company ATI used a dialogue between mocked-up characters from The Matrix to promote a graphics chip for laptops. </p> <p>'It's incredible, it's as if there's no limit to ATI innovation,' said the Keanu Reeves lookalike. 'This is my reality now. Mobius gives me mobility.' </p> <p>But he can't go - oh, no - on the orders of the leather-clad female character. 'You can't leave yet,' she intercedes, because 'it's time for you to experience TV Wonder USB'. </p> <p>Hitachi's attempts at entertainment were especially awful, drowning out any possibility of conversation in neighbouring stands. Someone called Bob Kolyer, a dead ringer for magician David Copperfield, became unfeasibly excited about promoting DVD-Ram technology from his 'catwalk' stage. 'Don't go away, we will be showing nothing but the sexiest most beautiful technology you can ever use,' he said. </p> <p>Scantily clad, pouting models then strode around the catwalk showing off their diskettes, hard-drives, and digicams. </p> <p>They weren't the only ones. Sybersay, a Californian purveyor of 'state-of-the-ear' technology, crammed in four Barbarella lookalikes, resplendent in metallic blue jumpsuits, to show off earphones at their booth. </p> <p>'In the south hall - that's the billion dollar boy's club where they have the beautiful, almost naked ladies,' said Michael McLean of Advanced Scientific Corporation, one of the smaller exhibitors whose booth was in the north hall. </p> <p>Perhaps unsurprising then, given such marketing methods, that Adultdex 2000 should spring up in parallel to Comdex. Taking place on the 'same days as Comdex, [but] later hours!' that event promised 'the latest in multimedia, video, DVD, internet, and video conferencing'. The fliers were perhaps intended to confuse jet-lagged, sleep-deprived techies. They certainly were a reminder of the pivotal role of pornography in the commercialisation of new media, from VHS cassettes to satellite TV and the internet. </p> <p>The sprawling mass of over-promotion and hyperbole that is Comdex is contradictory in itself. Given the vision of driving purchasing and marketing on to the net, surely mass meetings such as Comdex will be unnecessary? There are clearly other compelling reasons for its 200,000 delegates to visit. 'It's the biggest adult toy store you have ever been in,' said McLean. 'I'll be back next year and it will be even wilder.' </p> <p>John Di Lamo, the taxi driver, offered a contrary view: 'It's quite scary that our entire economy is in these guys' hands.' He may have a point. </p> <p><strong>For five days, no one sleeps</strong><br></p> <p> It is the biggest roadshow on earth. A giant movable feast dedicated to the biggest, sexiest, technologies around. At this time every year more than 2,300 of the world's largest companies, including the likes of Compaq, Cisco, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Microsoft and Nokia, descend on Las Vegas to unveil their latest products and strut their stuff. A company's share price can soar on a slick presentation, often made to a live audience of 10,000 and simultaneously webcast around the world. </p> <p>More than 200,000 movers and shakers of the IT world pour into the gambling mecca and for five days no one sleeps. It is not unusual for conferences to start at seven in the evening while the partying goes on until dawn. The clamour to attend the 'keynote' address which starts the event - this year given by Bill Gates - has people queuing down the strip. Much of the after-hours action takes place in three of Vegas's biggest hotels - the Venetian, the MGM Grand and the Hilton, which are booked up years in advance. Similarly, during Comdex week only the IT posse can get into the most upmarket restaurants such as Tsunami, renowned for its sushi. </p> <p>During the day, companies get to sell themselves at the Las Vegas Convention Centre and the Sands Expo and Convention Centre. Booths at the conference can be up to 10,000 square feet. For this year's event, Comdex's organiser, Key3Media, sold more than one million square feet of space. </p> <p>And Comdex has its eyes on world dominance. There are now 17 Comdex-branded events in 12 countries, including Brazil and Germany. The Comdex events accounted for nearly 40 per cent of the $251 million of revenue generated by Key3Media last year. </p> <p>The event organiser is so flushed with its own success that this year it decided to hold its own exclusive party. Numerous politicians, and New York Stock Exchange boss Richard Grasso, turned up to help the company celebrate its good fortune. How long before Comdex comes over here? </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:faisal.islam@observer.co.uk\"> faisal.islam@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

The racy bets this year were on wireless and networking technologies, and preferably combinations of the two. Perhaps the recent addition of a half-size Eiffel Tower to Las Vegas's casino district helped focus US companies on wireless technologies traditionally dominated by Europe. The busiest booths sported an array of such mobile gadgetry. Those promoting Palm Pilots, the similar Handspring Visor, and Ericsson mobile phones, were packed. Delegates, all employed in the technology sector, were easily worked into a lather over the prospect of winning T-shirts, baseball caps and pens. Surely their share options haven't fallen that far? At times it felt more like a university freshers' fair than the foremost convention of America's most important industry. But there is one major difference - money, and stacks of it. Las Vegas is the perfect location for the meeting of an industry which, despite recent turbulence, is awash with cash. Limousines seemed more numerous than taxis. The Pyramids, the Arc de Triomphe, the Rialto Bridge, volcanos, sharks, tigers and lions were all there. EDS, the software services company, spent $6 million on its Comdex presence. 'The digital economy rocks!' shouted its booth. EDS tried to prove this by hiring out pop diva Macy Gray. She sang to assorted minions of the new economy in a converted hangar at Las Vegas airport. A performance which can only be described as 'National Semiconductor - the musical' in the Comdex north hall took up this theme. One song featured lyrics such as 'Our market is growing so fast/The future is here to last, at Nat-ion-aal' and 'from personal devices to TV news/National is making it to use/we're freeing people from the PC'. This 'tyranny' of the personal computer was a recurring theme during the conference. In part this reflects the Microsoft factor - it is the Manchester United of the tech world: disliked by hardcore geeks but nonetheless extremely successful. Historically, some conflicts have been about land and others about ideology but for these guys it boils down to the thorny issue of where you store your 'apps' - either locally on a PC, or on a central device accessed by more nimble network computers. The clearest manifestation of this was Microsoft's escalation of the war of words with Oracle and its charismatic chief executive, Larry Ellison. 'Larry's been talking about ideas that have gone nowhere for years. How long has he been talking about the [network computer]? Six years, seven years? Where did it go? Nowhere,' said Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive. 'You're considered a dead company if you write applications for the PC,' said Ellison, before referring to Microsoft's new Tablet PC concept as irrelevant 'pen computing'. He also hinted that he may take on Bill Clinton after his presidential term finishes in January. But Microsoft spin-meisters had the best of it. They handed out mugs to people attending Ellison's speech, which claimed that Oracle salesman offer a $1m discount when trying to secure business from Microsoft customers. 'When Oracle salesman pitches $5m of overpriced software, simply glance at the mug,' it reads. 'Oracle salesman spots mug, offers 20 per cent discount.' If that upset Ellison, then he was delighted to hear that he may be the model for a character in the forthcoming Charlie's Angels movie. Tim Curry plays a wealthy tech-exec with a penchant for fast cars and Japanese-style houses. Ellison only expressed disappointment that action star Steven Seagal wasn't playing 'him'. Back at the exhibition, film imagery was being used extensively to inject an air of excitement into attempts to sell graphics cards, DVD drives and even earphones. Canadian graphics company ATI used a dialogue between mocked-up characters from The Matrix to promote a graphics chip for laptops. 'It's incredible, it's as if there's no limit to ATI innovation,' said the Keanu Reeves lookalike. 'This is my reality now. Mobius gives me mobility.' But he can't go - oh, no - on the orders of the leather-clad female character. 'You can't leave yet,' she intercedes, because 'it's time for you to experience TV Wonder USB'. Hitachi's attempts at entertainment were especially awful, drowning out any possibility of conversation in neighbouring stands. Someone called Bob Kolyer, a dead ringer for magician David Copperfield, became unfeasibly excited about promoting DVD-Ram technology from his 'catwalk' stage. 'Don't go away, we will be showing nothing but the sexiest most beautiful technology you can ever use,' he said. Scantily clad, pouting models then strode around the catwalk showing off their diskettes, hard-drives, and digicams. They weren't the only ones. Sybersay, a Californian purveyor of 'state-of-the-ear' technology, crammed in four Barbarella lookalikes, resplendent in metallic blue jumpsuits, to show off earphones at their booth. 'In the south hall - that's the billion dollar boy's club where they have the beautiful, almost naked ladies,' said Michael McLean of Advanced Scientific Corporation, one of the smaller exhibitors whose booth was in the north hall. Perhaps unsurprising then, given such marketing methods, that Adultdex 2000 should spring up in parallel to Comdex. Taking place on the 'same days as Comdex, [but] later hours!' that event promised 'the latest in multimedia, video, DVD, internet, and video conferencing'. The fliers were perhaps intended to confuse jet-lagged, sleep-deprived techies. They certainly were a reminder of the pivotal role of pornography in the commercialisation of new media, from VHS cassettes to satellite TV and the internet. The sprawling mass of over-promotion and hyperbole that is Comdex is contradictory in itself. Given the vision of driving purchasing and marketing on to the net, surely mass meetings such as Comdex will be unnecessary? There are clearly other compelling reasons for its 200,000 delegates to visit. 'It's the biggest adult toy store you have ever been in,' said McLean. 'I'll be back next year and it will be even wilder.' John Di Lamo, the taxi driver, offered a contrary view: 'It's quite scary that our entire economy is in these guys' hands.' He may have a point. For five days, no one sleeps It is the biggest roadshow on earth. A giant movable feast dedicated to the biggest, sexiest, technologies around. At this time every year more than 2,300 of the world's largest companies, including the likes of Compaq, Cisco, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Microsoft and Nokia, descend on Las Vegas to unveil their latest products and strut their stuff. A company's share price can soar on a slick presentation, often made to a live audience of 10,000 and simultaneously webcast around the world. More than 200,000 movers and shakers of the IT world pour into the gambling mecca and for five days no one sleeps. It is not unusual for conferences to start at seven in the evening while the partying goes on until dawn. The clamour to attend the 'keynote' address which starts the event - this year given by Bill Gates - has people queuing down the strip. Much of the after-hours action takes place in three of Vegas's biggest hotels - the Venetian, the MGM Grand and the Hilton, which are booked up years in advance. Similarly, during Comdex week only the IT posse can get into the most upmarket restaurants such as Tsunami, renowned for its sushi. During the day, companies get to sell themselves at the Las Vegas Convention Centre and the Sands Expo and Convention Centre. Booths at the conference can be up to 10,000 square feet. For this year's event, Comdex's organiser, Key3Media, sold more than one million square feet of space. And Comdex has its eyes on world dominance. There are now 17 Comdex-branded events in 12 countries, including Brazil and Germany. The Comdex events accounted for nearly 40 per cent of the $251 million of revenue generated by Key3Media last year. The event organiser is so flushed with its own success that this year it decided to hold its own exclusive party. Numerous politicians, and New York Stock Exchange boss Richard Grasso, turned up to help the company celebrate its good fortune. How long before Comdex comes over here? faisal.islam@observer.co.uk",

At the Kyoto environment summit three years ago, the industrialised nations agreed, in principle, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to a figure 7 per cent below their 1990 output. Unfortunately, no one has been able to agree how to achieve this, or even to ratify the Kyoto summit. That is the purpose of the Hague summit. </p> <p>The prime problem is America, the world's greatest emitter of carbon dioxide, which presses, with increasing insistence, that it should be spared from reducing its output and should instead be allowed to create new forests, both in the US and the Third World. These trees and plants, known collectively as carbon sinks, will soak up all that nasty carbon dioxide, say US delegates, and will obviate the need for Americans to abandon their profligacy. </p> <p>The US also believes that by planting crops specially designed to soak up carbon dioxide, it could extend its 'sink' philosophy from the wild to the farmyard, thus strengthening its case for unabated industrial emissions.

Many of us work because we like it. </p> <p>'The old argument over \"work-life\" balance has always assumed that home is good and office bad,' said Judith Doyle, a leading cultural trends analyst who carried out the study for the Industrial Society. 'But home can be a dreary place and the office can be enjoyable. </p> <p>'Work for many people is fun. People listen to you, they laugh at your jokes, they appreciate your skills. Even with families there, home can be empty and cold in comparison.' </p> <p>Just over half the respondents to a nationwide survey agreed with the statement: 'If I had enough money to live as comfortably as I would like, I would still work.' The desire to keep on working increases to 70 per cent among those with salaries over \u00a370,000. </p> <p>Elaine Thompson from Lyme Regis won \u00a32.7 million on the National Lottery in December 1995. Yet she and her husband returned to work after six months, opening the Champernhayes holiday complex. 'We do all the cleaning and gardening and painting ourselves,' she says, 'and we're busy 52 weeks a year. I haven't had a weekend off since March, although we hope to go away for a week over next February's half-term. </p> <p>'I couldn't sit back and do nothing but golfing and drinking. You can enjoy life and work hard too. If I didn't work I'd be bored silly.' </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Lottery operator Camelot said: 'The research matches our own survey - 51% of all Lottery winners who won \u00a350,000 or more have returned to work in spite of their win.' </p> <p>Britain's most celebrated return-to-work Lottery winners were the staff of the homeless persons unit at Camden Council in London. In January 1996 a 30-person syndicate all returned to their jobs the Monday morning after winning \u00a310m. They insisted that their clients needed them and that their work was rewarding. A year later the unit won a government Charter Mark certificate of excellence. </p> <p>Tom Piper received a 'comfortable amount' after he and his sisters sold their mother's large London home. The 35-year-old stage designer says: 'I had a choice - whether to go away and live off the money or to continue as before. But by working I have a chance to be paid to be creative and to deal with other people and to be part of the world. </p> <p>'It's just not viable for me to do nothing. There's such a lot of pleasure to be had out of working hard and making something happen.' </p> <p>Five years ago 46-year old Norfolk decorator Tim Logan also inherited a 'reasonably large' sum when his aunt died. 'It was enough for me not to have to work again, particularly as I never had very high outgoings. However, when I'd taken a fortnight's holiday and thought things through, I realised quite simply that I needed to work. </p> <p>'It's the social interaction and the satisfaction and the stimulus. I couldn't go and play golf all week. I'd be bored out of my mind. The only thing that's changed slightly is that I can be a bit fussier about work that I take. I will usually say I'm too busy to do bog-standard stuff, I prefer challenging things. But I work five days a week quite happily.' </p> <p>Jayne Buxton, co-founder of Flametree, the work-life balance website, said: 'It's clear that although half of workers take pleasure from their work, the other half still see it as a chore. Money is certainly the main motivating factor for women going to work either full- or part-time. There's a long way to go before all employees - not just women - are empowered to get the most out of their work and home lives.' </p> <p>But Doyle insisted: 'As employment becomes much more knowledge- and service-based, people appear to be getting more satisfaction from it. For increasing numbers, work is no longer just fixing widgets in a factory. People may stay with employers for a shorter time than they used to, however there's no reason why they shouldn't continue to be loyal if they are treated well.' </p> <p>As Britain's economy moves towards the lowest levels of structural unemployment for a generation, employers are becoming keener than ever to improve workplace satisfaction. The latest American innovation being introduced by some UK employers desperate to keep good staff is 'duvet days', two or three days a year on which every employee can decide on the spur of the moment that they want to stay in bed. </p> <p>Other good practice which encourages employee loyalty includes fairer bonus sys tems, better communication with staff and provision of canteen or rest spaces where employees can gossip, said Doyle. Her study will be published this week by the Futures division of the Industrial Society. </p> <p><strong>What would you do with a fortune?</strong></p> <p><strong> Flush</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Go to your local building society and ask about rates for long-term savers.</p> <p>\u0095 Invest in FTSE 100 'bricks and mortar' companies. </p> <p>\u0095 Buy a place in the country.

Just over half the respondents to a nationwide survey agreed with the statement: 'If I had enough money to live as comfortably as I would like, I would still work.' The desire to keep on working increases to 70 per cent among those with salaries over \u00a370,000. Elaine Thompson from Lyme Regis won \u00a32.7 million on the National Lottery in December 1995. Yet she and her husband returned to work after six months, opening the Champernhayes holiday complex. 'We do all the cleaning and gardening and painting ourselves,' she says, 'and we're busy 52 weeks a year. I haven't had a weekend off since March, although we hope to go away for a week over next February's half-term. 'I couldn't sit back and do nothing but golfing and drinking. You can enjoy life and work hard too. If I didn't work I'd be bored silly.' A spokeswoman for Lottery operator Camelot said: 'The research matches our own survey - 51% of all Lottery winners who won \u00a350,000 or more have returned to work in spite of their win.' Britain's most celebrated return-to-work Lottery winners were the staff of the homeless persons unit at Camden Council in London. In January 1996 a 30-person syndicate all returned to their jobs the Monday morning after winning \u00a310m. They insisted that their clients needed them and that their work was rewarding. A year later the unit won a government Charter Mark certificate of excellence. Tom Piper received a 'comfortable amount' after he and his sisters sold their mother's large London home. The 35-year-old stage designer says: 'I had a choice - whether to go away and live off the money or to continue as before. But by working I have a chance to be paid to be creative and to deal with other people and to be part of the world. 'It's just not viable for me to do nothing. There's such a lot of pleasure to be had out of working hard and making something happen.' Five years ago 46-year old Norfolk decorator Tim Logan also inherited a 'reasonably large' sum when his aunt died. 'It was enough for me not to have to work again, particularly as I never had very high outgoings. However, when I'd taken a fortnight's holiday and thought things through, I realised quite simply that I needed to work. 'It's the social interaction and the satisfaction and the stimulus. I couldn't go and play golf all week. I'd be bored out of my mind. The only thing that's changed slightly is that I can be a bit fussier about work that I take. I will usually say I'm too busy to do bog-standard stuff, I prefer challenging things. But I work five days a week quite happily.' Jayne Buxton, co-founder of Flametree, the work-life balance website, said: 'It's clear that although half of workers take pleasure from their work, the other half still see it as a chore. Money is certainly the main motivating factor for women going to work either full- or part-time. There's a long way to go before all employees - not just women - are empowered to get the most out of their work and home lives.' But Doyle insisted: 'As employment becomes much more knowledge- and service-based, people appear to be getting more satisfaction from it. For increasing numbers, work is no longer just fixing widgets in a factory. People may stay with employers for a shorter time than they used to, however there's no reason why they shouldn't continue to be loyal if they are treated well.' As Britain's economy moves towards the lowest levels of structural unemployment for a generation, employers are becoming keener than ever to improve workplace satisfaction. The latest American innovation being introduced by some UK employers desperate to keep good staff is 'duvet days', two or three days a year on which every employee can decide on the spur of the moment that they want to stay in bed. Other good practice which encourages employee loyalty includes fairer bonus sys tems, better communication with staff and provision of canteen or rest spaces where employees can gossip, said Doyle.

      "body": "<p>So that's that then. The internet boom is over. Last week brought the now usual wave of casualties and lost hopes. TheStreet.com closed its British operation with more than 60 job losses, Ready2shop puts its website into 'hibernation', the Government's auction of the fixed wireless spectrum is collapsing, and the take-up of third-generation Wap mobiles is bitterly disappointing. </p> <p>Infopunditry is at sixes and sevens. No more confident predictions that everything from the newspaper to the nation state is set to die before the advance of the new economy. No more talk of a new business model which frees dotcoms from the tedious preoccupation of making a profit. Instead, the dotcoms are watching their numbers being decimated. Their hope is to get to the 'other side' of the current evaporation of investor confidence when the old order will re-establish itself and everyone can become a millionaire again. </p> <p>In this hope, they are wrong. The boom in hi-tech shares that cascaded out of the United States to infect the globe really was like seventeenth-century tulip-mania. It will never return in the same way; indeed, the greater risk is that the puncturing of the bubble will precipitate a recession as banks and institutional investors draw in their horns to cover their losses, thus triggering as vicious a circle of retraction as dizzying as its upward impulse during the boom. </p> <p>The danger in this atmosphere is that we get as pessimistic about the impact of the new economy as we once got over-optimistic. The arrival of information technology is transformatory, at least for those parts of the economy and society where it goes with the grain of social possibility. IT is making every organisation more porous, with communication enabling new alliances and partnerships; the future organisational form will not be the traditional inwardly focused, hierarchically structured factory or office, but the externally focused network. But the trick to understanding what the network economy and society will bring is not to get swept away by the discontinuities between then and now - it is to understand what must endure. </p> <p>This has been the Achilles' heel of infopunditry. The fact, for example, that an almost infinite amount of information is instantly available and communicable on the web is only a precondition for change, not its guarantor. Information has to serve an economic and social purpose. The reason why mobile-phone usage has taken off is that it has been socially driven. The mobile, and especially personalised text and voice-mail messages, permits a deepening of social interaction and our capacity to interact with other human beings - witness its role in teenagers' social lives. The mobile phone is not a tool to enable us to migrate to cyberspace; it is a tool that grounds us in human interaction. </p> <p>This is why predictions that the net will see the end, for example, of the newspaper are so silly. Users of news websites use them in addition to, rather than instead of, their newspaper reading; it is something they have read that will typically trigger a search for more information on the net. </p> <p>The newspaper remains a portable and accessible source of news, but just as importantly is a key link to membership of whatever cultural subgroup to which we belong; rather than plough through the hits that search engines provide or log on to receive our customised news service, we read the paper that we trust to have sorted out what is important for us - and whose selections we need to know because they configure who we are in interaction with others. </p> <p>Indeed, newspapers are likely to become more rather than less important; they are trusted brands, landmarks that can guide us through a sea of information. The same rule applies to get any kind of fix on the future. Your projections have to pass the social interaction/social purpose test - and even then your chances of getting it right are pretty hit and miss. As Keynes observed, the point about the future is that it is unknowable. </p> <p>But take the supposition about social interaction and think it through. IT should work best either where it builds on pre-existing social patterns or creates new ones, or where the relationship is already nothing more than contractual and so does not depend on social interaction. Thus, IT usage would grow explosively and dynamically in two main areas: those professional and cultural domains, such as consultancy and the media, where it reinforces necessarily dense patterns of social interaction, or in those areas where all firms, especially manufacturers, have simply contractual relationships, notably with their supply chain. And those are the areas where its impact is already huge. If my hunch is right, one overriding result will be to entrench and widen the already alarming inequalities in the structure of work, patterns of income and lifestyles. </p> <p>So it is that there is a new, rich, individualistic but interdependent middle class emerging, centring on what John Knell, my colleague at the Industrial Society, has dubbed the free worker. These are the mobile, skilled individuals who can win business from the porous networked organisations as self-employed independents - everything from TV producers to business consultants. </p> <p>Their entry card is their reputation and contacts book, and to stop their talented workers from joining their ranks employers pay premium salaries, encourage home-working and relax their dress codes. These are the members of 'hot' networks enjoying the boom in house prices in the privileged, drawbridge ghettos in which they live, educating their children privately and who tend to be dismayingly politically disengaged. </p> <p>The losers are the anonymous workers for subcontractors in big supply chains, forced to bid for contracts in auctions mounted on the new procurement websites - and where relationships can be managed largely in cyberspace. The five great multinational car companies have just launched Covisint, the trade exchange that will post huge potential contracts on its procurement websites - but which will be auctioned by progressive lowering of the contract price. </p> <p>This is an instrument for ensuring contract compliance at the keenest prices, and whose impact will be to bid down wage rates along with terms and conditions of employment. But the contract relationship was nothing more than contractual in the first place; IT simply reinforces the capitalist logic to its brutal conclusion. </p> <p>What IT is doing, in short, is intensifying pre-existing trends, so that old arguments reappear in a wholly different guise. For example, the dotcoms that will survive and prosper will be those going with the grain - the auction sites and the specialist information providers. In public policy terms, though, the arrival of hot and cold networks, and the accompanying new inequalities, has the paradoxical consequence of remaking the case for redistributive tax policies, powerful social insurance and collective provision of schools and hospitals. </p> <p>They help society to cope with and exploit the new economy and its consequences rather than being 'burdens' to be reduced, so that the much derided European social model becomes an advantage rather than a hindrance. </p> <p>Information technology, notwithstanding its current travails, really is transformatory, but in ways few currently comprehend.</p>",

In this hope, they are wrong. The boom in hi-tech shares that cascaded out of the United States to infect the globe really was like seventeenth-century tulip-mania. It will never return in the same way; indeed, the greater risk is that the puncturing of the bubble will precipitate a recession as banks and institutional investors draw in their horns to cover their losses, thus triggering as vicious a circle of retraction as dizzying as its upward impulse during the boom. The danger in this atmosphere is that we get as pessimistic about the impact of the new economy as we once got over-optimistic. The arrival of information technology is transformatory, at least for those parts of the economy and society where it goes with the grain of social possibility. IT is making every organisation more porous, with communication enabling new alliances and partnerships; the future organisational form will not be the traditional inwardly focused, hierarchically structured factory or office, but the externally focused network. But the trick to understanding what the network economy and society will bring is not to get swept away by the discontinuities between then and now - it is to understand what must endure. This has been the Achilles' heel of infopunditry. The fact, for example, that an almost infinite amount of information is instantly available and communicable on the web is only a precondition for change, not its guarantor. Information has to serve an economic and social purpose. The reason why mobile-phone usage has taken off is that it has been socially driven. The mobile, and especially personalised text and voice-mail messages, permits a deepening of social interaction and our capacity to interact with other human beings - witness its role in teenagers' social lives. The mobile phone is not a tool to enable us to migrate to cyberspace; it is a tool that grounds us in human interaction. This is why predictions that the net will see the end, for example, of the newspaper are so silly. Users of news websites use them in addition to, rather than instead of, their newspaper reading; it is something they have read that will typically trigger a search for more information on the net. The newspaper remains a portable and accessible source of news, but just as importantly is a key link to membership of whatever cultural subgroup to which we belong; rather than plough through the hits that search engines provide or log on to receive our customised news service, we read the paper that we trust to have sorted out what is important for us - and whose selections we need to know because they configure who we are in interaction with others. Indeed, newspapers are likely to become more rather than less important; they are trusted brands, landmarks that can guide us through a sea of information. The same rule applies to get any kind of fix on the future. Your projections have to pass the social interaction/social purpose test - and even then your chances of getting it right are pretty hit and miss. As Keynes observed, the point about the future is that it is unknowable. But take the supposition about social interaction and think it through. IT should work best either where it builds on pre-existing social patterns or creates new ones, or where the relationship is already nothing more than contractual and so does not depend on social interaction. Thus, IT usage would grow explosively and dynamically in two main areas: those professional and cultural domains, such as consultancy and the media, where it reinforces necessarily dense patterns of social interaction, or in those areas where all firms, especially manufacturers, have simply contractual relationships, notably with their supply chain. And those are the areas where its impact is already huge. If my hunch is right, one overriding result will be to entrench and widen the already alarming inequalities in the structure of work, patterns of income and lifestyles. So it is that there is a new, rich, individualistic but interdependent middle class emerging, centring on what John Knell, my colleague at the Industrial Society, has dubbed the free worker. These are the mobile, skilled individuals who can win business from the porous networked organisations as self-employed independents - everything from TV producers to business consultants. Their entry card is their reputation and contacts book, and to stop their talented workers from joining their ranks employers pay premium salaries, encourage home-working and relax their dress codes. These are the members of 'hot' networks enjoying the boom in house prices in the privileged, drawbridge ghettos in which they live, educating their children privately and who tend to be dismayingly politically disengaged. The losers are the anonymous workers for subcontractors in big supply chains, forced to bid for contracts in auctions mounted on the new procurement websites - and where relationships can be managed largely in cyberspace. The five great multinational car companies have just launched Covisint, the trade exchange that will post huge potential contracts on its procurement websites - but which will be auctioned by progressive lowering of the contract price. This is an instrument for ensuring contract compliance at the keenest prices, and whose impact will be to bid down wage rates along with terms and conditions of employment. But the contract relationship was nothing more than contractual in the first place; IT simply reinforces the capitalist logic to its brutal conclusion. What IT is doing, in short, is intensifying pre-existing trends, so that old arguments reappear in a wholly different guise. For example, the dotcoms that will survive and prosper will be those going with the grain - the auction sites and the specialist information providers. In public policy terms, though, the arrival of hot and cold networks, and the accompanying new inequalities, has the paradoxical consequence of remaking the case for redistributive tax policies, powerful social insurance and collective provision of schools and hospitals. They help society to cope with and exploit the new economy and its consequences rather than being 'burdens' to be reduced, so that the much derided European social model becomes an advantage rather than a hindrance. Information technology, notwithstanding its current travails, really is transformatory, but in ways few currently comprehend.",

But both Winsor and Prescott blatantly refused to express support for the chief executive after the incident.</p> <p>Although they could not interfere with his position in a private company, as two of the men with the most influence over rail policy their refusal to bolster Corbett left him mortally wounded.</p> <p>When Corbett offered to quit the day after the accident but was begged to stay by his board of directors, The Observer revealed that he did not have the support of Prescott and it would be a matter of weeks before he would be forced to go.</p> <p>Railtrack sources said: 'Following Hatfield, the industry pulled together. But it didn't take long for the briefing against him to start.'</p> <p>On Friday Corbett claimed he had been under no pressure to resign. The previous day he had met with the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to outline new ways of accelerating his rail recovery plan and had given no indication that he was about to quit.</p> <p>But a source said: 'After the meeting with the PM, he thought he'd given the solution, lanced the boil and it was time to go. Number 10, Gus [Lord Macdonald, the Transport Minister] and Sir Alastair [Morton, chairman of the shadow Strategic Rail Authority] have been supportive. Prescott and Winsor haven't. They were furious that Corbett saw a conflict between safety and improved services.'</p> <p>A Railtrack insider said: 'In the media circus, Gerald was Railtrack. Everything was taken down and used in evidence against him.</p> <p>As the number of speed restrictions on the rail network doubled from 250 shortly after the Hatfield crash to more than 500 now, Railtrack was accused by GNER, the East Coast mainline train operator, of creating 'chaos'. As the problems mounted, severe flooding throughout the UK meant many tracks had to be closed.</p> <p>Accusations of who was to blame flew between Railtrack and the train operators. Corbett accused the operators of being partially responsible for the state of the railways.</p> <p>Corbett, 49, floated the idea of resigning a second time last Sunday, a fortnight after The Observer revealed that he was to go 'within weeks'.

      "bodyText": "Railtrack boss Gerald Corbett resigned last week because he was furious about a ruthless campaign to undermine him conducted by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott and the powerful rail regulator Tom Winsor, The Observer has established. He finally quit on Friday when it became clear that senior train-operating company bosses were appalled at the way he virtually shut down the network after last month's Hatfield crash and could not guarantee a normal service would be restored until next Easter. Passengers face a winter of delays - while safety fears over broken rails remain and fresh concern arose this weekend about drivers suffering fatigue as they adapt to disrupted timetables and operating speeds. Corbett and his 'steward ship' of Railtrack had repeatedly been under attack from Winsor before the Hatfield derailment of a GNER train that killed four last month. But both Winsor and Prescott blatantly refused to express support for the chief executive after the incident. Although they could not interfere with his position in a private company, as two of the men with the most influence over rail policy their refusal to bolster Corbett left him mortally wounded. When Corbett offered to quit the day after the accident but was begged to stay by his board of directors, The Observer revealed that he did not have the support of Prescott and it would be a matter of weeks before he would be forced to go. Railtrack sources said: 'Following Hatfield, the industry pulled together. But it didn't take long for the briefing against him to start.' On Friday Corbett claimed he had been under no pressure to resign. The previous day he had met with the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to outline new ways of accelerating his rail recovery plan and had given no indication that he was about to quit. But a source said: 'After the meeting with the PM, he thought he'd given the solution, lanced the boil and it was time to go. Number 10, Gus [Lord Macdonald, the Transport Minister] and Sir Alastair [Morton, chairman of the shadow Strategic Rail Authority] have been supportive. Prescott and Winsor haven't. They were furious that Corbett saw a conflict between safety and improved services.' A Railtrack insider said: 'In the media circus, Gerald was Railtrack. Everything was taken down and used in evidence against him. As the number of speed restrictions on the rail network doubled from 250 shortly after the Hatfield crash to more than 500 now, Railtrack was accused by GNER, the East Coast mainline train operator, of creating 'chaos'. As the problems mounted, severe flooding throughout the UK meant many tracks had to be closed. Accusations of who was to blame flew between Railtrack and the train operators. Corbett accused the operators of being partially responsible for the state of the railways. Corbett, 49, floated the idea of resigning a second time last Sunday, a fortnight after The Observer revealed that he was to go 'within weeks'. He declared his position was no longer tenable due to Prescott and Winsor's lack of support. Railtrack announced that the chaos was going to cost around \u00a3250m to put right, but it was still going to increase the dividend to shareholders, angering rail safety groups. On Friday, Corbett walked into the office of Railtrack chairman Sir Philip Beck and announced that he was going to quit and that this time it was for definite. Beck did not try to change his mind. Corbett, who last year was paid nearly \u00a3400,000 and pension contribution of \u00a3189,000, has a 12-month notice period on his contract. Last night there were suggestions that he would receive only a six-month pay-off, a claim denied by those close to Corbett.",

      "bodyText": "The British Government has destroyed the conditions enabling the IRA to open new talks with the international body dealing with arms decommissioning, Sinn Fein warned yesterday. The warning came as the republican movement is poised to reject the Government's Bill on the Patten reforms of the RUC and to advise young nationalists not to join the new police force. Pat Doherty, the Sinn Fein vice-president, told The Observer that Tony Blair's handling of the Patten Bill had 'ruined the context' for his party to go to the IRA and ask that it re-engage with General John de Chastelain's International Commission on Decommissioning. In an article for today's issue, Doherty called on the Prime Minister and Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, to return the Patten Bill to its original, undiluted form to avert a new crisis in the peace process. 'The Mandelson Bill, as it currently stands, will not receive the support of Sinn Fein, and we would actively discourage our people from joining. Nor would we nominate or recommend that any republican or nationalist accept positions on the proposed policing boards.' Doherty said it was the British Government, not David Trimble's Ulster Unionists, which had diluted the recommendations of the Patten Report. 'The British Government can and must, even at this latest stage, rectify this situation if it genuinely seeks what is required by the Agreement. That is a policing service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole.' Asked if Sinn Fein was prepared to ask the IRA to re-open talks with General de Chastelain, Doherty said: 'The IRA said they would carry out a second confidence -building measure and then re-engage with de Chastelain, but only in the context of political change.

I just can't see the IRA re-engaging with de Chastelain's commission in this current situation, especially since Patten has been gutted.' The Sinn Fein vice-president called on Blair to use the 'reserve powers' that Mandelson employed as Northern Ireland Secretary to overturn Trimble's ban on his party colleagues attending the North-South meetings. Doherty described the present impasse as 'very, very serious', but refused to compare it with the situation in the winter of 1995, which led to the IRA breaking its first ceasefire with the Canary Wharf bomb. \u0095 John Hume urged Trimble to lift his sanctions against Sinn Fein, and called on the IRA to re-open its dialogue with the de Chastelain body to try to save the province's power-sharing government. Hume told his party conference in Newcastle, Co Down, that the First Minister's ban was 'counterproductive'. Trimble imposed the ban during last month's Ulster Unionist Council meeting because the IRA had failed to live up to its promises to re-engage with the commission.

This is true only of issues such as name, badge, flag and symbols. But the refusal to implement Patten's recommendations in respect of the substantive issues is entirely down to the domination of the securocrats in the British system. In the final analysis it is the British Government which must shoulder the responsibility for this issue.</p> <p>We acknowledge that in the course of the legislative process a number of important changes were made to the original Bill introduced in May.

It is young nationalists, republicans and Catholics who need to be persuaded to join and support a new policing service. This Bill will not achieve that objective.</p> <p>The British Government can and must, even at this late stage, rectify this situation if it genuinely seeks what is required by the Agreement. That is, a policing service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole and which is representative in terms of the make up of the community as a whole.</p> <p>The gap must be closed. Patten must be implemented in full.

And no wonder, for the primary function of this unionist militia was to secure and sustain an undemocratic sectarian statelet. Republican/nationalist leaders will not acquiesce in the continuation of this type of policing by recommending that our communities join or support the police force that will result from the implementation of the Mandelson Bill. Peter Mandelson and the British Government should be under no illusions as to the importance of policing to the republican/nationalist community. This is a touchstone issue and unless it is addressed properly and in a manner that will allow those with influence on our community - the Church, political leaders and the Irish government - to recommend it, then it will have been a wasted exercise. Now, although the Patten report did not go as far as republicans wanted it to go, we acknowledged that it could have given us a basis from which to build the new beginning to policing that the Good Friday Agreement promised. If we are to have any chance of achieving this then the initial step has to be the bridging of the gap between what is currently contained in the Policing Bill and the benchmark of Patten. It is up to the British Government. We will make our decisions on all matters related to the issue of policing when we have all of the information - that is at the conclusion of the legislative process and when other matters not requiring legislation are published. For instance, a new implementation plan or codes of practice. Time is short, and it is imperative that the British Government act now. The 'Mandelson Bill' as it currently stands will not receive the support of Sinn Fein and we would actively discourage young people from giving it their support. Nor would we nominate for or recommend that any republican/nationalist accept positions on the proposed Police Boards. It should be pointed out that there exists a major and false perception - particularly in Britain - that the dilution of the Patten recommendations by the British Government is entirely at the behest of the Ulster Unionist Party. This is true only of issues such as name, badge, flag and symbols. But the refusal to implement Patten's recommendations in respect of the substantive issues is entirely down to the domination of the securocrats in the British system. In the final analysis it is the British Government which must shoulder the responsibility for this issue. We acknowledge that in the course of the legislative process a number of important changes were made to the original Bill introduced in May. However, the gap between the benchmark Patten recommendations and the mea sures being proposed by the British Government remains substantial. A whole range of crucial issues in the Patten Commission's report is not being implemented. These include recommendations in respect of: \u0095 The oath; \u0095 The name; \u0095 Badge, flag and symbols; \u0095 The powers of the Policing Board; \u0095 The scope to investigate past abuses by the RUC; \u0095 The Special Branch and the Full Time Reserve; \u0095 Community policing; \u0095 The remit of the Ombudsman; \u0095 The remit of the Oversight Commissioner. The fact remains that the RUC is 92 per cent Protestant and 100 per cent unionist. It is young nationalists, republicans and Catholics who need to be persuaded to join and support a new policing service. This Bill will not achieve that objective. The British Government can and must, even at this late stage, rectify this situation if it genuinely seeks what is required by the Agreement. That is, a policing service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole and which is representative in terms of the make up of the community as a whole. The gap must be closed. Patten must be implemented in full. To do otherwise will be to reject wilfully the opportunity to deal with this issue which is critical to society, to commitments made by the British Government and to the Agreement itself. \u0095 Pat Doherty is Vice-President of Sinn Fein.",

What they were asking themselves was this: do we need - or might we need - to go through an armed struggle phase before we reach the goal of a settlement with Israel.</p> <p>'It was no secret. It was being said in the Palestinian press. But at that stage it was evident that they were just throwing balls in the air. They were saying to us: \"Look, something terrible will happen - a disaster, a regional war - there will be a lot of violence, unless you give us what we want.\" Our assessment was that they would not want to disrupt the millennium celebrations or do anything until after the Pope's visit, so we calculated that nothing would happen until at least March.'</p> <p>According to this Israeli version, the key moment came not on 28 September with the visit of Likud leader Sharon to the Temple Mount. It came four months before on 15 May, on Nakba (Catastrophe) Day, the national holiday that marks the success of the Jewish armed struggle in creating an Israeli state in 1948.</p> <p>Nakba Day has always been a day of Palestinian protests; this year, however, the Israelis say, they noticed a different tenor to the violence. 'The previous year had been pretty quiet. This year there was a lot of live fire. It was a message - \"Look we mean business\". We were already looking at what had gone on before and we saw explicit signs of preparations.</p> <p>'There had been a gradual building of consciousness in the Arafat-controlled media for an armed struggle. We were also seeing explicit preparations for an uprising in the autumn. We were seeing dozens of training camps for the stone-throwers in the summer. We were also aware of exercises by Palestinian Authority security forces. We had seen a battalion-size exercise down in Gaza, and elsewhere low levels of military preparation. We also had evidence that weapons were being smuggled in Palestinian diplomatic vehicles.'</p> <p>According to this version, the crisis began in earnest at the end of July with the collapse of the Camp David talks.</p> <p>'When Arafat came back, everyone was on their toes waiting for the order to be given for an uprising. Instead we know Arafat gave the order not to activate the planned uprising.' Instead, say the Israelis, preparations continued throughout August with a series of statements by Arafat's leading lieutenants in the Palestinian press.</p> <p>'Both sides were preparing for war,' a European official working in the occupied territories says wearily, 'not just the Palestinians. No one had any doubt about it.' It was a view that was shared as early as last summer by the UN body responsible for refugees in the Palestinian areas: UNRWA.</p> <p>'Looking back,' says a senior European diplomat, 'UNRWA acted with due responsibility. They sat down and said: \"Do we need to have a contingency plan for an outbreak of fighting and the possibility of large-scale and long-term full closure of the Palestinian Territories in the autumn.\" Their view was \"Yes\".</p> <p>'There was a real feeling around Nakba Day in May that something was going to blow. Ordinary Palestinians were very fed up. They were dissatisfied with the Israelis, the peace process, even the Palestinian Authority itself. But Arafat and Barak were still talking.' He adds, however, that Western diplomats had evidence that Arafat had accumulated a war chest estimated at up to $1 billion - though not all of it instantly realisable.</p> <p>Indeed, the view of international diplomats is that even if Arafat was considering (or preparing) an uprising, the Israeli shootings at the Temple Mount on 29 September - the day after Sharon's visit - caught him unawares. 'I saw Arafat in late September,' says one diplomat. 'It was a few days before the intifada started and he was very relaxed. Violence seemed the furthest thing from his mind.'</p> <p>The Israeli military intelligence officer agrees. 'We don't believe Arafat planned an uprising for September. Our suspicion was that it was supposed to have started last week on 15 November. Arafat simply responded to events.'</p> <p>But if there is evidence that the Palestinian Authority was considering using an uprising to pursue a negotiated settlement, there is also clear evidence that the Israeli armed forces were also preparing for violence as early as 12 months ago when - by their own account - they regarded the threat of a new intifada as nothing more than rhetoric.</p> <p>Crucially, the Israeli Army had trained four battalions for a 'low-intensity conflict', including the Nahshon Battalion, established just over a year ago, as specialists in house-to-house fighting. Its troops were being trained in mock Palestinian villages constructed on two IDF bases, and taught how to break up demonstrations and target snipers. Palestinian security sources also allege that during the summer the IDF began giving settlers arms and weapons training.</p> <p>Israeli senior officers also admit that, after the Nakba Day shootings, they began to put their contingency plan, prepared in the autumn, into force. 'We increased the defence of our forces. By the time September came we were prepared mentally and physically. We did not realise that it was going to start on 29 September, but we were ready for considerable violence. We weren't taken by surprise.' Both sides had their fingers on the trigger. On 29 September, faced with rioting Palestinians on Temple Mount, the Israeli security forces pulled the trigger.</p> <p>But if the violence was being anticipated by both sides, then why? 'We underestimated how difficult the final status negotiations were going to be,' says a Western intelligence source. 'We had left and lumped the most difficult things together. The status of Jerusalem and the holy sites, refugee returns, settlements and final status borders. No one had done their homework before Camp David. The gaps were just too great. But we pushed on and insisted Arafat should attend the negotiations when he did not want to come.</p> <p>'What we got was a dangerous hardening of positions. The Palestinians were increasingly angry about being bullied by the Americans and calculated that an uprising at the time of the US presidential elections could internationalise the crisis and dilute American influence. The Israelis, anticipating this, seemed happy for there to be a crisis. They calculated that as long as they could keep the casualties low they could get through it, and it would strengthen their position with the Americans. This is cynicism on both sides of the highest order.'</p> <p>Hussein al-Sheikh is a marked man these days. As a commander of Arafat's Fatah movement in Ramallah, and held responsible for attacks on Jewish targets, he is one of those the Israelis would like taken out of the picture. We meet in an anonymous building with gunmen at the door.</p> <p>'The decision to go to war was an Israeli decision,' he says. 'The Israelis had decided they no longer considered Arafat a partner in peace. They were looking for an excuse to annex territory rather than negotiate its return. Prime Minister Barak was talking peace while preparing for war. We were pushed into this conflict.'</p> <p>Later I am in Tel Aviv talking to David Chacham, a former colonel in the IDF who became an Israeli negotiator in the peace process. Now he is an adviser to the Israeli Ministry of Defence and Barak's office on Arab affairs.</p> <p>'Maybe Barak is right,' he says. 'Maybe Arafat is not a partner for peace. I am convinced he could stop the violence now. Arafat is playing a strategic game.</p> <p>'Arafat has always made it clear that he regards the decision to talk peace as a strategic one. When he is not getting what he wants, as we have seen often in Palestinian politics, there is a recourse to violence in a time of crisis. There is an expression for it in Arabic. It means all the options are open, including violence.'</p> <p>I ask Chacham why his side too has not done more to reduce the violence, especially the fatal shootings of young stone throwers.</p> <p>He seems surprised and a little irritated by the question. 'You cannot ask our soldiers to fight with their hands tied,' he says. <br><br><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\" target=\"_new\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\" target=\"_new\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.moledet.org.il/moleng.htm\" target=\"_new\">Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party) <br></a><a href=\"http://www.iris.org.il/\" target=\"_new\">Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3188/\" target=\"_new\">Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.virtual.co.il/orgs/orgs/ichud/irindex.htm\" target=\"_new\">Organisation of Rabbis for the People of Israel</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Israel and the Palestinians were both actively preparing for an armed uprising in the occupied territories up to a year before the outbreak of the current violence. Both were convinced the other was planning to start a conflict to benefit their negotiating positions in the peace process, it has been established by The Observer after a month-long investigation. The startling new version of the immediate causes of the seven weeks of bloodshed that has left more than 230 dead and 8,000 injured has emerged from interviews with Western diplomats and senior military, intelligence and political figures on both sides of the violence. It is a version that rejects the notion of the intifada (uprising) being a reaction to the Israeli killings of Palestinian protesters at the Temple Mount, demonstrating against a visit to Islam's third holiest site on 28 September by the veteran Israeli hawk, Ariel Sharon. It is a version that - while accepting the genuine disillusion of ordinary Palestinians with the peace process and their widespread support for the intifada - suggests their anger is being cynically manipulated for political ends. It is a version, too, that gets tacit support from those closest to the struggle. Sitting in his office on the West Bank discussing the Palestinian conduct of the intifada, a Hamas leader asks if we are off the record, then grins. 'This is all a play. The intifada is a game,' he says, when asked about the excessive loss of life on the Palestinian side. 'The violence and deaths are part of the negotiations for the peace process. But no one is going to tell that to the parents of the children and young men who have died.' He confirms what many observers of the violence of the last few weeks have long suspected. As UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan prepares to send a fact-finding mission to investigate the conflict, it has become clear that there is a curious ebb and flow to the clashes on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip.

It does not matter whether the rocks land close enough to harm the soldiers, they fire back in any case. The truth is that neither side wants to be seen as willing to back down. 'I guess it was last November that we started getting wind of a plan for an uprising,' says the senior Israeli military intelligence officer. As we speak he flips between Israeli and Palestinian TV and fields calls from a bank of telephones that report exchanges of fire, as darkness falls across the West Bank. It is as revealing about what the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) were thinking as about what the Palestinian Authority was alleged to be planning. 'We assessed that Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority were calculating that they were not going to get what they wanted from [Israeli Prime Minister] Ehud Barak. What they were asking themselves was this: do we need - or might we need - to go through an armed struggle phase before we reach the goal of a settlement with Israel. 'It was no secret.

Indeed, the view of international diplomats is that even if Arafat was considering (or preparing) an uprising, the Israeli shootings at the Temple Mount on 29 September - the day after Sharon's visit - caught him unawares. 'I saw Arafat in late September,' says one diplomat. 'It was a few days before the intifada started and he was very relaxed. Violence seemed the furthest thing from his mind.' The Israeli military intelligence officer agrees. 'We don't believe Arafat planned an uprising for September. Our suspicion was that it was supposed to have started last week on 15 November. Arafat simply responded to events.' But if there is evidence that the Palestinian Authority was considering using an uprising to pursue a negotiated settlement, there is also clear evidence that the Israeli armed forces were also preparing for violence as early as 12 months ago when - by their own account - they regarded the threat of a new intifada as nothing more than rhetoric. Crucially, the Israeli Army had trained four battalions for a 'low-intensity conflict', including the Nahshon Battalion, established just over a year ago, as specialists in house-to-house fighting. Its troops were being trained in mock Palestinian villages constructed on two IDF bases, and taught how to break up demonstrations and target snipers. Palestinian security sources also allege that during the summer the IDF began giving settlers arms and weapons training. Israeli senior officers also admit that, after the Nakba Day shootings, they began to put their contingency plan, prepared in the autumn, into force. 'We increased the defence of our forces. By the time September came we were prepared mentally and physically. We did not realise that it was going to start on 29 September, but we were ready for considerable violence. We weren't taken by surprise.' Both sides had their fingers on the trigger. On 29 September, faced with rioting Palestinians on Temple Mount, the Israeli security forces pulled the trigger. But if the violence was being anticipated by both sides, then why? 'We underestimated how difficult the final status negotiations were going to be,' says a Western intelligence source. 'We had left and lumped the most difficult things together. The status of Jerusalem and the holy sites, refugee returns, settlements and final status borders. No one had done their homework before Camp David. The gaps were just too great. But we pushed on and insisted Arafat should attend the negotiations when he did not want to come. 'What we got was a dangerous hardening of positions. The Palestinians were increasingly angry about being bullied by the Americans and calculated that an uprising at the time of the US presidential elections could internationalise the crisis and dilute American influence. The Israelis, anticipating this, seemed happy for there to be a crisis. They calculated that as long as they could keep the casualties low they could get through it, and it would strengthen their position with the Americans. This is cynicism on both sides of the highest order.' Hussein al-Sheikh is a marked man these days. As a commander of Arafat's Fatah movement in Ramallah, and held responsible for attacks on Jewish targets, he is one of those the Israelis would like taken out of the picture. We meet in an anonymous building with gunmen at the door. 'The decision to go to war was an Israeli decision,' he says. 'The Israelis had decided they no longer considered Arafat a partner in peace. They were looking for an excuse to annex territory rather than negotiate its return. Prime Minister Barak was talking peace while preparing for war. We were pushed into this conflict.' Later I am in Tel Aviv talking to David Chacham, a former colonel in the IDF who became an Israeli negotiator in the peace process. Now he is an adviser to the Israeli Ministry of Defence and Barak's office on Arab affairs. 'Maybe Barak is right,' he says. 'Maybe Arafat is not a partner for peace. I am convinced he could stop the violence now. Arafat is playing a strategic game. 'Arafat has always made it clear that he regards the decision to talk peace as a strategic one. When he is not getting what he wants, as we have seen often in Palestinian politics, there is a recourse to violence in a time of crisis. There is an expression for it in Arabic. It means all the options are open, including violence.' I ask Chacham why his side too has not done more to reduce the violence, especially the fatal shootings of young stone throwers. He seems surprised and a little irritated by the question. 'You cannot ask our soldiers to fight with their hands tied,' he says.

      "body": "<p>Well, was it fair? Will the 'process' - ceaselessly invoked - finally install the President that America wanted on election day? Here are just a few of the things that, according to taste, can seem grotesquely unfair.</p> <p>There is the mismatch of voting methods across the United States, and often within states like Florida. Sometimes you use rusty chunks of metal a century old, sometimes the punch cards that Palm Beach made famous, sometimes optical character readers scan writing on paper, sometimes you press a screen as though you were taking money from a bank cash till. No system is perfect; each, in a desperately close election, has a margin of error or confusion that matters.</p> <p>As long ago as 1984, an independent report found a 'significant lack of confidence' in the punched results from Palm Beach. Nothing was done. Twelve days ago, 19,120 voters went to the polls there and recorded an invalid ballot: 10,000 - unbelievably - failed to make any choice of President, while 1,000 more punched two holes or the wrong hole on a ballot form, which was certainly confusing and possibly illegal. A shambles.</p> <p>But there are so many other matters which, to British nostrils, reek of unfairness. Take those who can vote. Not convicted felons: that wipes some 444,000 Florida citizens, mostly blacks, from the democratic reckoning forever. One puff of pot and you're out.</p> <p>Take where you vote. The counties foot the bill, so rich counties have many, well-staffed booths - while poor (usually black) counties make voting a long ordeal of queues and non-information. It's easier to vote if you're white and rich.</p> <p>Take simple cock-ups, the eternal tale of humanity: the tens of thousands - from Illinois to Maryland - who'd registered to vote, but found they weren't on the rolls; the black bear which invaded a Michigan polling station and had to be shot; the 22,000 votes ruled out of order in Jacksonville because Democrat canvassers gave their voters duff advice about form-filling.</p> <p>Take postal ballots trailing in 10 days late with no standard procedure for telling what was, and what wasn't, decided in good faith on or before polling day. Take the partisanship built into the system. Local election boards are politically appointed by politicians for politicians. When they decide to count or re-count, they are pawns to party advantage.</p> <p>Take the lawyers and the majesty of their law. Who appointed this or that judge, because - golly! - that's important? Who will promote Judge A or Judge B to higher things once this tricky decision is over? Politicians. No wonder, time after time, that the bench is full of recuseniks. Integrity today can be unemployment tomorrow.</p> <p>Take lofty legal officers like Florida's Secretary of State. She's not just a politician, but co-chair of the Elect George W committee. Her conflict of interest, like her attempt at decision-making, is final.</p> <p>Take the $3 billion spent on this election, the ads, the deluded exit polls revealed before one end of Florida, let alone any state in the Pacific time zone, has finished voting. Take the antique foolishness of an electoral college weighted to whites in small southern states at the expense of America. Take the simple popular vote which makes senators, governors and school board chairmen - but not presidents.</p> <p>Can any of this be fair? It is all, every last jot of it, what we normally mean by unfairness. Justice, in any precise sense, has not been done.</p> <p>But that is not quite the end of the story and, as the Florida Supreme Court hugs its dignity, the last chapter has yet to be written. Consider what the Bush teamsters, had they not been quite so busy going to court last week, could have said. That the political partisanship, otherwise complained about so vociferously, in fact represents the constant impact of balloting in this most democratic of countries. Katherine Harris is Secretary of State because she won on a Republican ticket. The Palm Beach County election board is Democrat-dominated because Palm Beach is a Democrat county. The key woman on that board, Theresa LePore, the designer of the butterfly ballots, has been a Democrat all her life.</p> <p>The people of her county - after 1984 - could have campaigned for the lousy punch card machines to be replaced. They didn't. They could have raised instant protests over the butterfly sheets. They didn't. Each and every one of them, entering the polling booths, was permitted three goes at filling in a ballot correctly. They had plenty of helpers on hand. They could check that the card hadn't been punched twice, or not punched at all, before they put it in the counting box. They didn't.</p> <p>The system, full of inefficiencies and coagulations, may stink, but it is also a system which belongs to the voters who now complain so shrilly about it. It is - in a way we don't fully comprehend in Britain - their system run by their officials under the superintendence of their courts. All of which can be democratically changed. In short, they own this shambles.</p> <p>This Observer observer, who is neither a Democrat nor a Republican, can't help feeling that fairness and responsibility go together here.

      "bodyText": "Well, was it fair? Will the 'process' - ceaselessly invoked - finally install the President that America wanted on election day? Here are just a few of the things that, according to taste, can seem grotesquely unfair. There is the mismatch of voting methods across the United States, and often within states like Florida. Sometimes you use rusty chunks of metal a century old, sometimes the punch cards that Palm Beach made famous, sometimes optical character readers scan writing on paper, sometimes you press a screen as though you were taking money from a bank cash till. No system is perfect; each, in a desperately close election, has a margin of error or confusion that matters. As long ago as 1984, an independent report found a 'significant lack of confidence' in the punched results from Palm Beach. Nothing was done. Twelve days ago, 19,120 voters went to the polls there and recorded an invalid ballot: 10,000 - unbelievably - failed to make any choice of President, while 1,000 more punched two holes or the wrong hole on a ballot form, which was certainly confusing and possibly illegal. A shambles. But there are so many other matters which, to British nostrils, reek of unfairness. Take those who can vote. Not convicted felons: that wipes some 444,000 Florida citizens, mostly blacks, from the democratic reckoning forever. One puff of pot and you're out. Take where you vote. The counties foot the bill, so rich counties have many, well-staffed booths - while poor (usually black) counties make voting a long ordeal of queues and non-information. It's easier to vote if you're white and rich. Take simple cock-ups, the eternal tale of humanity: the tens of thousands - from Illinois to Maryland - who'd registered to vote, but found they weren't on the rolls; the black bear which invaded a Michigan polling station and had to be shot; the 22,000 votes ruled out of order in Jacksonville because Democrat canvassers gave their voters duff advice about form-filling. Take postal ballots trailing in 10 days late with no standard procedure for telling what was, and what wasn't, decided in good faith on or before polling day. Take the partisanship built into the system. Local election boards are politically appointed by politicians for politicians. When they decide to count or re-count, they are pawns to party advantage. Take the lawyers and the majesty of their law. Who appointed this or that judge, because - golly! - that's important? Who will promote Judge A or Judge B to higher things once this tricky decision is over? Politicians. No wonder, time after time, that the bench is full of recuseniks. Integrity today can be unemployment tomorrow. Take lofty legal officers like Florida's Secretary of State. She's not just a politician, but co-chair of the Elect George W committee. Her conflict of interest, like her attempt at decision-making, is final. Take the $3 billion spent on this election, the ads, the deluded exit polls revealed before one end of Florida, let alone any state in the Pacific time zone, has finished voting. Take the antique foolishness of an electoral college weighted to whites in small southern states at the expense of America. Take the simple popular vote which makes senators, governors and school board chairmen - but not presidents. Can any of this be fair? It is all, every last jot of it, what we normally mean by unfairness. Justice, in any precise sense, has not been done. But that is not quite the end of the story and, as the Florida Supreme Court hugs its dignity, the last chapter has yet to be written. Consider what the Bush teamsters, had they not been quite so busy going to court last week, could have said. That the political partisanship, otherwise complained about so vociferously, in fact represents the constant impact of balloting in this most democratic of countries. Katherine Harris is Secretary of State because she won on a Republican ticket. The Palm Beach County election board is Democrat-dominated because Palm Beach is a Democrat county. The key woman on that board, Theresa LePore, the designer of the butterfly ballots, has been a Democrat all her life. The people of her county - after 1984 - could have campaigned for the lousy punch card machines to be replaced. They didn't. They could have raised instant protests over the butterfly sheets. They didn't. Each and every one of them, entering the polling booths, was permitted three goes at filling in a ballot correctly. They had plenty of helpers on hand. They could check that the card hadn't been punched twice, or not punched at all, before they put it in the counting box. They didn't. The system, full of inefficiencies and coagulations, may stink, but it is also a system which belongs to the voters who now complain so shrilly about it. It is - in a way we don't fully comprehend in Britain - their system run by their officials under the superintendence of their courts. All of which can be democratically changed. In short, they own this shambles. This Observer observer, who is neither a Democrat nor a Republican, can't help feeling that fairness and responsibility go together here. The Gore camp has had the best of the political argument. Something was wrong in Palm Beach County. It would have been better to sort it out by a hand recount or a re-vote, if necessary state-wide. This 'felt fair' solution is what Florida voters (and probably their Supreme Court) want. The Bush camp, constantly moaning about hand counts of the kind George W has signed into Texas law and closing its ears to the cries of public opinion, has managed to look shifty and ruthless and arrogant. None of that will help the Republicans if they eventually come to to govern a divided nation and (more testingly) a bitterly divided Congress; but real fairness, alas, is a rather more elusive concept. The rules of this game were set by the people, underwritten by the people, financed or not financed by the people. The hanging chads were left by the people. The failure to check ballot forms was people error. Can any Supreme Court - Democrat appointees every one - exorcise such responsibilities?

      "byline": "Heather Connon",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Does having a combined chairman and chief executive make a difference to a company's performance? The Association of British Insurers clearly thinks there is a case to answer. It is writing to about two dozen of the top 350 British companies which, more than five years after it was outlawed by the Cadbury corporate governance report, still have one person doing both jobs. The association is asking non-executives why they are not complying with the corporate governance rules, and when they intend to review the situation. </p> <p>The list of offenders seems to give plenty of cause for concern. British Land, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Marks &amp; Spencer: all have seen their shares head spectacularly south in recent years. For years, Greg Hutchings did the two jobs at Tomkins. Not only has its share price fallen dramatically, its corporate governance standards were so lax that Hutchings and his fellow directors were apparently allowed to enjoy perks such as corporate flats and jets and have some of their domestic expenses charged to the company. </p> <p>With others on the list, however, the case is less obvious. Shares in Amvescap, Misys - even after the recent sharp reversal - and Billiton have outperformed the market despite a concentration of power at the top. And some of the worst corporate disasters in recent years - the row over Cedric Brown's salary at British Gas and the fiasco at United Utilities for example - happened despite the presence of an independent chairman on the board. At P&amp;O, by contrast, Lord Sterling has managed to preside over an orderly break-up of the group, despite the absence of a chief executive as foil to his hands-on chairmanship. </p> <p>The ABI has no empirical evidence to link performance with corporate governance. Indeed, such evidence is thin on the ground. The closest we can get is a recent report by McKinsey, the management consultants, which concluded that investors themselves believe it makes a difference. McKinsey put the good governance premium at around 18 per cent in the UK. </p> <p>So should investors who lack the ABI's power to insist on changes avoid companies that do not comply with governance codes? There are certainly worse ways to screen your investments - particularly when the going starts to get rough. </p> <p>Combined chairman and chief executives may look like excellent stewards when everything is going smoothly. But that can change rapidly. An autocratic boss - particularly one who has, in effect, created the company - is more likely to ignore danger signals than someone whose role is more like an employee. </p> <p>At Tomkins, for example, Hutchings resisted a break-up of the group long after it was clear that the conglomerate structure was not working. At M&amp;S, the then chairman Sir Richard Greenbury - who effectively created the modern group - not only refused to listen to criticism, he also tried to control the appointment of his successor. </p> <p>That does not mean that you should rule out buying a company with a combined chairman and chief executive. However, it does mean you should be extra cautious. Look for strong non-executives to counter his power. And be prepared to bail out quickly when the going gets rough. </p> <p><strong> Still on the line</strong><br> </p> <p> Energis, the telecoms company that was once part of National Grid, is one of the more established of the new breed of ex-utility operators. Others, like Scottish Power offshoot Thus, have a much shorter pedigree. </p> <p>The headstart does seem to be producing some advantages. Not in profits, of course - after paying its interest and tax bills and writing down the huge amount it is investing in the network, Energis' operating loss doubled to \u00a310.5 million in the six months to September. But, on the same basis, it is making money in Britain - a \u00a320.3m profit for the period, up from \u00a32.7m last time. </p> <p>At this stage, however, the key is revenue and Energis seems to be making progress. Overall, turnover rose 81 per cent to \u00a3368m, including a 54 per cent rise in the UK. It has signed up an impressive client list, including Friends Provident, EDS and web-hosting clients include Boots and Chrysalis. And it is rapidly rolling out its international network, adding Germany and Ireland in the period. </p> <p>That should put it in a good position to be among the finishers in the telecoms race. The trouble is, it is too early to say for certain. Energis's shares have fallen from a high of 812p in March to last week's close of 503p and are likely to remain volatile. The 37 per cent stake still owned by National Grid can be sold from next spring so takeover speculation could buoy the shares. Even so, only those who are willing to take a punt on the outcome of the tele coms handicap should consider buying. </p> <p><strong> Dull but solid</strong><br> </p> <p>How long will it take investors in chemicals company BOC to forget that they almost had 1,460p a share in their hands, through the aborted bid from rival Air Liquide? It will be at least until BOC's shares get there under their own steam - and, judging by the results for the year to 30 September, that could take some time. </p> <p>Not that there was anything wrong with the figures in themselves. An 11 per cent rise in pre-tax profits before exceptionals, on turnover 15 per cent ahead, is a solid performance. But it was hardly spectacular and, for all chief executive Tony Isaac's promises, solid is exactly where it is likely to stay. </p> <p>BOC is already on target to make the promised \u00a3120m cost cuts. The pledge to increase annual sales to \u00a35 billion, compared with last year's \u00a33.9bn, will be a harder target to meet. Its industrial gases business depends heavily on the highly cyclical steel business, and although its vacuum technology division sparkled last year on the back of a buoyant semi-conductor market that industry remains extremely volatile. In distribution, its main customer - Marks &amp; Spencer - is facing growing questions about the very viability, never mind the profitability, of its food business. </p> <p>BOC's price/earnings multiple of 13, based on forecasts of \u00a3497m for the current year, reflects its solid but unspectacular status. The yield is, however, an attractive 4 per cent and those who value solidity may find that a reason to buy.</p>",

Combined chairman and chief executives may look like excellent stewards when everything is going smoothly. But that can change rapidly. An autocratic boss - particularly one who has, in effect, created the company - is more likely to ignore danger signals than someone whose role is more like an employee. At Tomkins, for example, Hutchings resisted a break-up of the group long after it was clear that the conglomerate structure was not working. At M&amp;S, the then chairman Sir Richard Greenbury - who effectively created the modern group - not only refused to listen to criticism, he also tried to control the appointment of his successor. That does not mean that you should rule out buying a company with a combined chairman and chief executive. However, it does mean you should be extra cautious. Look for strong non-executives to counter his power. And be prepared to bail out quickly when the going gets rough. Still on the line Energis, the telecoms company that was once part of National Grid, is one of the more established of the new breed of ex-utility operators. Others, like Scottish Power offshoot Thus, have a much shorter pedigree. The headstart does seem to be producing some advantages. Not in profits, of course - after paying its interest and tax bills and writing down the huge amount it is investing in the network, Energis' operating loss doubled to \u00a310.5 million in the six months to September. But, on the same basis, it is making money in Britain - a \u00a320.3m profit for the period, up from \u00a32.7m last time. At this stage, however, the key is revenue and Energis seems to be making progress. Overall, turnover rose 81 per cent to \u00a3368m, including a 54 per cent rise in the UK. It has signed up an impressive client list, including Friends Provident, EDS and web-hosting clients include Boots and Chrysalis. And it is rapidly rolling out its international network, adding Germany and Ireland in the period. That should put it in a good position to be among the finishers in the telecoms race. The trouble is, it is too early to say for certain. Energis's shares have fallen from a high of 812p in March to last week's close of 503p and are likely to remain volatile. The 37 per cent stake still owned by National Grid can be sold from next spring so takeover speculation could buoy the shares. Even so, only those who are willing to take a punt on the outcome of the tele coms handicap should consider buying. Dull but solid How long will it take investors in chemicals company BOC to forget that they almost had 1,460p a share in their hands, through the aborted bid from rival Air Liquide? It will be at least until BOC's shares get there under their own steam - and, judging by the results for the year to 30 September, that could take some time. Not that there was anything wrong with the figures in themselves. An 11 per cent rise in pre-tax profits before exceptionals, on turnover 15 per cent ahead, is a solid performance. But it was hardly spectacular and, for all chief executive Tony Isaac's promises, solid is exactly where it is likely to stay. BOC is already on target to make the promised \u00a3120m cost cuts. The pledge to increase annual sales to \u00a35 billion, compared with last year's \u00a33.9bn, will be a harder target to meet. Its industrial gases business depends heavily on the highly cyclical steel business, and although its vacuum technology division sparkled last year on the back of a buoyant semi-conductor market that industry remains extremely volatile. In distribution, its main customer - Marks &amp; Spencer - is facing growing questions about the very viability, never mind the profitability, of its food business. BOC's price/earnings multiple of 13, based on forecasts of \u00a3497m for the current year, reflects its solid but unspectacular status. The yield is, however, an attractive 4 per cent and those who value solidity may find that a reason to buy.",

This remains one of the great derbies, though sadly the Blues were too long out of practice to make it much of a match. </p> <p>'You could feel the relief of our supporters at the end,' Joe Royle confessed after City's fourth consecutive defeat. 'Probably one or two of them were thinking it might be a rout.' </p> <p>It should have been.

Traditional rivalries were preserved right up to the kick off, with City fans greeting visitors from Old Trafford with a 'Welcome to Manchester' banner and Roy Keane preferring to shake the mascot's hand rather than that of rival captain Alf Inge Haaland, who had seized the morning headlines with the view that it was hypocritical of \u00a350,000-a-week players to criticise the supporters who paid their wages. </p> <p>Practically the first thing City did once the game got under way was to put themselves under a huge handicap. Haaland clumsily and unnecessarily felled Paul Scholes to give David Beckham exactly the sort of shooting chance Royle must have warned his players about conceding. Admittedly the free kick was marginally closer to the half way line than the goal line, which may explain why City decided a wall was unnecessary, but Beckham is deadly from any distance and proved it with a glorious strike which went past Nicky Weaver's outstretched hand at almost 70 miles per hour. 'I don't think you need a wall from that distance,' Royle doggedly maintained. 'We had two half-walls, but we might have been better off with no wall at all - letting the goalkeeper see the ball. A goalkeeper who is considered one of the best in the country should not be beaten from 35 yards out.' </p> <p>The pattern of the afternoon was therefore established early on, with City obliged to come forward for an equaliser and United able to utilise their collective pace and Beckham's passing ability to strike on the break. So it proved, though with chances at both ends in either half of a remarkably open game it was astonishing that the score remained unchanged. </p> <p>City were unlucky on a few occasions in the second half, notably when Wes Brown cleared a Haaland header off the line then pulled over Paul Dickov for what looked like a clear penalty, but the main reason the home side were in with a chance until the final whistle was some truly atrocious United finishing. </p> <p>Dwight Yorke in particular will be glad Sir Alex Ferguson missed this game, and will be hoping the only video he watches on his return from South Africa will be the one from his son's wedding.

Credit to the goalkeeper on that occasion, though in the first half Yorke was also denied by a block from Spencer Prior after Beckham had threaded a pass through to Phil Neville, and by an agile clearance from Steve Howey when Weaver was stranded off his line. </p> <p>There were not always City players between Yorke and goal, however, and when Phil Neville, again, and then the outstanding Keane sent over inviting crosses from the byline on the right, the striker was unable to make contact. </p> <p>That was just the first half. Royle sent on Shaun Goater and Ian Bishop after the interval to improve City's strike rate, though not Paulo Wanchope, whom the manager explained had been dropped and not rested. In the first half the highly promising Shaun Wright-Phillips had been City's liveliest attacker, but City went forward to good effect in the second - with Fabien Barthez saving from Goater and Paul Dickov and watching the latter miss a far post sitter. It led to Steve McClaren speaking of United having to grind out the result. </p> <p>This was ridiculous, for although United could not have complained had City managed an equaliser, they continued to create and squander chances throughout the second half.

'How we didn't score a second goal I'll never know,' McClaren said. 'We had enough chances and numerous one-on-ones. We didn't expect to score so early, I guess. I phoned Sir Alex to tell him the result, and he said he wasn't surprised, the players always seem to make life as hard as possible for the manager.' </p> <p>McClaren praised referee Steve Dunn's performance in handling a full-blooded derby without dishing out too many cards, Royle diplomatically kept his thoughts to himself.

Over the past few years, he's loomed out of the mid-cast-list mist to become the most visible of invisible character actors. </p> <p>In The Talented Mr Ripley, he stole the film with his portrayal of Freddie, the creepily louche expat who comes to a sticky end. In Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, he was outstanding as the compassionate male nurse who looks after the dying Jason Robards (the role was written specifically for Seymour Hoffman). Whatever the merits or defects of the films he's graced - from Boogie Nights to Twister to Happiness - Hoffman has effortlessly stood out, specialising in spooky man-child marginals that you'd ordinarily cross the street to avoid, and building up what he wryly calls 'my quirky redheaded-guy rep company'. </p> <p>Hoffman hasn't just stolen scenes from the name-above-the-title likes of Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow and Tom Cruise; he's slipped whole movies into bags marked 'SWAG' and disappeared into the night with them. Next up is the tortured drag queen he doesn't so much play as inhabit in Joel Schumacher's Flawless; even Robert De Niro, mangling his vowels as a stroke victim getting singing lessons from Hoffman's Rusty, has to play second fiddle in this one. 'When I told people I had Philip in Flawless, they looked blank,' says Schumacher. 'But when you say, \"He played so-and-so in Twister\", they always go, \"Oh my God! I loved that guy!\"' </p> <p> Flawless marks something of a watershed for Hoffman. It's his first leading role: 'I've had to make the transition from sweeping in for 15 minutes, doing my stuff and clearing out, to carrying a movie for the duration - in a dress.' And the plaudits he's receiving are such that his can't-quite-place-him days are numbered. 'He's probably one of our greatest character actors, if not the greatest,' declares Schumacher. 'We bandy the term \"chameleonic\" around all the time about actors, but he really has that quality. In spades.' 'He has no vanity about his work. He's constantly pushing things and taking them to new levels,' raves Anderson down the phone from LA. 'He's an actor's actor, really fearless,' notes John C Reilly, Hoffman's co-star in Boogie Nights, Magnolia and the recent New York stage run of Sam Shephard's True West (a two-hander in which the actors intermittently swapped roles). 'He's not afraid to explore all sides of the character, including the ugly, creepy things that go on inside of all our heads.' </p> <p>Thankfully, the real-life Hoffman, who, despite his redoubtable track record, is still only 33, isn't in the least bit ugly or creepy when we meet in New York ('People used to be funny about approaching me, but now they seem to think I'm as sane as anyone who's done what I've done in movies can be'). Off-duty, his demeanour is a world away from the intense physicality he displays onscreen. Hunkered down in a chair, baseball cap pulled tight on his head with whorls of dirty straw-coloured hair gushing out of the sides, he's clad in the standard 'resting' gear of shapeless shirt and baggy cargo shorts revealing formidable tree-trunk legs. He appears to be making an effort to contain himself, or disappear altogether, but his expansive way with a cigarette - arcing it around his head and down to the ashtray in extravagant swoops - and the occasional emphatic outburst - 'Right right right right right!' he booms in his throaty, lightly camp East Coast drawl, rocking back and forth, a Cheshire-cat grin cracking his non-designer-stubbled and more-handsome-than-you'd-imagine face - remind you that this is indeed the man who vied with the eponymous star of Twister in sound and fury terms. </p> <p>Since Flawless, Hoffman has completed two more movies, both also watersheds. In Cameron Crowe's rock memoir Almost Famous (which opened the London Film Festival this month) he plays 70s gonzoid rock journalist and speedfreak Lester Bangs - a sort of headbanging Hunter S Thompson - who takes teenage Rolling Stone scribe and Crowe manqu\u00e9 William Miller (Patrick Fugit) in hand. It's Hoffman's first mentor role, 'albeit a dysfunctional one,' he chortles. But his most unlikely transformation takes place in David Mamet's State And Main, a screwball comedy opening in February in which he gets to play the romantic lead, wooing Mamet's wife and muse Rebecca Pidgeon. 'I'm the straight man in the middle,' he beams, 'the most normal, quiet-spoken guy I've ever played. It's great, really different from anything I've done before. For once, everything's happening to me, instead of me happening to it.' </p> <p> While longtime Hoffman-watchers might be alarmed by this lurch into benignity, recent reports suggest that it might be less of a career move and more of an insanity limitation exercise; in an Entertainment Weekly interview, Hoffman was quoted as saying that he sometimes thinks about quitting, because his trademark edgy roles take so much out of him: 'I think a lot about giving up, because you want to leave stuff alone sometimes. And when you don't act for a while, you feel better.' </p> <p>So it's calm down or quits? Nonsense, says Hoffman. 'It was a total misquote. My soul is in good shape. I was just saying I could picture a time where I won't act as much, because you get so involved and just need a break. But I couldn't give up acting,' he shrugs. 'I'd just get depressed and go down the drain. Though life's a hell of a lot more complicated these days. It gets to the point where you don't know what city you were just in. It's like, Monday? Toronto? Shouldn't I have called my mom? Isn't she in the hospital?' Nonetheless, he concedes, 'part of me feels like the showier kind of edgy stuff is going away anyway; I'm moving into other kinds of edgy. I don't want to repeat myself. I'm not going to play a guy like Allen in Happiness again any time soon because I did that and I don't want to tarnish or dilute that film by doing it again, maybe less well. At the same time, I don't intend to bland out. Life isn't safe or smooth, it's odd, quirky, strange and difficult, along with all the good stuff. If you leave out any of those things, you're not getting what's interesting to begin with.' </p> <p>This is the nearest he comes to a mission statement, but there's no denying that Hoffman goes the full nine yards for each role; in fact, in best Spinal Tap tradition, his yards go up to 11. As Scotty in Boogie Nights, watching his beloved Dirk attacking a usurping rival, he was all outsized pre-pubescence, rigid in horror at the rear of the frame, clasping his arm to his side like a child about to burst into tears; in Happiness, he finally got to go to bed with a woman, only to contort himself on top of her pink coverlet into a foetal frenzy. No wonder he's become known as the screen poet of emotional retardation. These characters are bona-fide losers, not in the classic Hollywood lovable-sap kind of way, but as in Beck's ' I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? ' 'He flipped me out when we did Boogie Nights,' says Anderson. 'He kept doing these weird twitches, movements, accidents, stutters. Not in a flashy, pyrotechnic sense; he'll just throw anything into the pot he thinks is right.' </p> <p>So what emotional depths is Hoffman plumbing to create this parade of credible misfits? Pop psychologists - and journalists - would zero in on the parallels between art and life, but Hoffman likes to play a straight bat when it comes to the latter. 'I want people to respond to the characters, not to me,' he protests. Nevertheless, the facts are these: he was born in Fairport, a suburb of Rochester, New York. His parents divorced when he was nine, and he was raised, along with his younger brother and older and younger sisters, by his civil-rights-activist mother, who's running for family court judge in the state. 'I don't think it was any odder than anyone else's upbringing,' he maintains, though it's obviously left him with a taste for politics; he'll 'host' Last Party 2000, a documentary on the US election campaign, due for release next year. </p> <p>A theatre buff from an early age, he got into acting at high school when he developed a crush on a girl who was appearing in a class production of The Crucible: 'Sadly, she had the hots for my brother.' He seems particularly keen to correct a persistent misapprehension, fostered by his penchant for characters of at best ambiguous sexuality, that he's gay - not, perhaps, aiding his case by revealing that his favourite film is The Rose, with Bette Midler - by alluding to various affairs, including the first time he fell in love: 'I was at college at 19, lying in bed with a woman I adored, reading The Bell Jar, listening to Patsy Cline, and feeling alienated. It was perfect.' However, he says he's currently 'very single'. </p> <p>Perhaps the biggest clue to his corporeal screen presence is the fact that the portly Hoffman was once a top jock. 'I was a good baseball player and wrestler in high school, but I got a neck injury, and that was the end of that,' he says. 'I think there's still a frustrated athlete inside.' (In fact, as well as all the classic slumming-actor jobs like waiting tables, Hoffman had a brief spell as a lifeguard.) Would this account for the physicality he brings to his roles? 'Oh, I'm sure of it,' he says, nodding vigorously. 'Using my body in an expressive way is my favourite thing to do. Body language informs so much about who you are.' </p> <p>Hoffman studied theatre at New York University. 'I spent six years going through all the classics,' he says. 'I think it's essential to be grounded in theatre for any actor who really wants to up their game.' He describes last year's 140-show run of True West as 'awesome' (there are tentative plans to bring it to the West End in the new year, but Hoffman describes his and Reilly's schedules as 'pretty stacked right now') and, for good measure, runs his own off-Broadway theatre company, LAByrinth, from his West Village apartment. </p> <p>He waxes lyrical about the rehearsal process and 'the freedom to play around with characters'. His perfectionism is legendary. In Flawless he spent weeks getting Rusty's walk and intonation right: 'My back hurt, my throat was sore from talking high. It was like I had a constant cold.' Rusty, he says, is 'just a person who wants to be loved, wants to feel safe'. And while Schumacher, who also wrote the screenplay, auditioned dozens of real drag queens, he says Hoffman was the only person who absolutely understood the role. 'He realised that he was playing a transgendered person, someone who truly feels they've been born in the wrong body. Drag queens create this \u00fcber female persona, whereas Philip was prepared to show all sides of the character.' One of Schumacher's favourite scenes is when Rusty returns from his mother's funeral in 'man drag' of a suit and tie; cowering in his flat, his face a picture of self-loathing, he looks diminished: 'Phil got the balance of vulnerability and fierceness exactly right.' </p> <p>He might demur, but is Hoffman really saying that none of this emotionally onerous stuff has ever freaked him out a bit? 'No, I don't tend to be afraid,' he confirms, with another sweep of his cigarette. 'Not if I'm supported by great art, whether in the writing or directing. I don't want to do fucking weird shit for its own sake. That's really disturbing. If I see a movie full of vicious violence or sex with no context for it, I think that's deeply irresponsible.' Has he scared himself sometimes? 'Oh sure sure sure sure sure,' he exclaims. 'Some of the things I've done, I've thought: Well, I sure won't be going back there for a while. But it's a containable kind of craziness. I know when I get home that I'm not Rusty or Scotty. But things do affect your life,' he continues, looking a little pained. 'It's not like mumbo-jumbo Methody stuff, but it can get a little bothersome. If you spend the day jerking off in front of a camera, you go home and you're, well, spent. It's painful.' </p> <p>His role in Almost Famous involved a different challenge - that of playing a 'real' person. 'I didn't know his work at all,' says Hoffman. 'Cameron brought a lot of his stuff over and I thought I'd have to humour him, you know, go, \"Ooh Cameron, it's really good\", but it's actually fantastic, passionate stuff.' The way he 'found' Bangs illustrates the way he 'builds up' his characters. 'I need to get an understanding of someone and start from there. Cameron gave me guidance and showed me videos, but when I listened to his interviews and heard his Midwestern accent come out strongly, then fade back till it wasn't there at all, I knew if I could get a sense of that confidence mixed with gaucheness, I'd be fine. I didn't just want to do an impression of him.' Crowe was floored: 'What Philip did was be Lester, and yet also be Phil being Lester. It was uncanny.' Once he's 'recognised' something in a character, says Hoffman, then 'I start asking myself questions about them, like how they'd react in a certain situation, and ideas start to come from your imagination, and you try them, and if they don't work you try something else.' </p> <p>Hoffman, while 'trying to do as much work as I can before I show up on set', likes to keep experimenting once the cameras start rolling. 'And sometimes directors are, like, \"Oh, what are you doing?\" And I say, \"Well, I'm just trying something out\", so maybe they trust me or maybe I freak them out.' Schumacher is of the former school. 'He's incredibly demanding of himself. He'd do 5,000 takes if you let him; a few times I thought things were perfect and he'd go, \"No, I don't think my pinkie was feminine enough in that last one.\" I think he thinks he's a pain the ass. He was always going, \"Could we try...\" and then apologising profusely.' Cameron Crowe was another: 'Watching Phil at work, burrowing away at a character is an education in itself.' </p> <p>David Mamet seems to belong firmly in the what-are-you-doing camp. When I ask Hoffman about State And Main, in which, as a flustered screenwriter on a typically venal Hollywood set, he turns in a beautifully nuanced performance without bouncing off any walls - for once, you might even empathise with him - he hesitates. 'Mmm, it was good,' he says carefully. 'Me and Mamet think differently about acting. He's very \"don't worry about all that other stuff - just do it\". Which is fine, I respect that, but he probably thought I'd be holding up the action while I agonised over how to stress a syllable in my trailer or something. So we felt each other out a lot.' </p> <p>Hoffman and Mamet do have one thing in common; in Hoffman's words, they're 'really not West Coast kinds of guys'. However, the West Coast is keen to coopt Hoffman, as the daily avalanche of scripts thunking on to his doormat attests. Which presents him with something of a dilemma: with the adjective 'Hoffmanesque' already in tentative circulation, has he become almost too famous? 'I'd like to do some leads,' he says, 'then dive back down. I don't want to move much beyond where I am now, but then I think people realise that action-hero movie-star stuff isn't really my thing. It's good to keep the invisibility factor strong. I'm not as anonymous now, but hopefully I can create something interesting and compelling enough that you forget it's me, rather than go, \"Oh, another barnstorming Hoffman performance.\"' </p> <p>Unfortunately or not, for us seasoned Hoffman-heads, those days will never return, but it's hard not to agree with Schumacher's admittedly partial tribute: 'I think he's a master. And it's amazing to remember that, in career terms, he's only just begun. I can't wait to see what he'll give us next.'</p> <p>\u0095 Flawless opens on 24 November; Almost Famous on 26 January</p>",

Which presents him with something of a dilemma: with the adjective 'Hoffmanesque' already in tentative circulation, has he become almost too famous? 'I'd like to do some leads,' he says, 'then dive back down. I don't want to move much beyond where I am now, but then I think people realise that action-hero movie-star stuff isn't really my thing. It's good to keep the invisibility factor strong. I'm not as anonymous now, but hopefully I can create something interesting and compelling enough that you forget it's me, rather than go, \"Oh, another barnstorming Hoffman performance.\"' Unfortunately or not, for us seasoned Hoffman-heads, those days will never return, but it's hard not to agree with Schumacher's admittedly partial tribute: 'I think he's a master. And it's amazing to remember that, in career terms, he's only just begun. I can't wait to see what he'll give us next.' \u0095 Flawless opens on 24 November; Almost Famous on 26 January",

      "body": "<p>Gwyneth Paltrow, who last year became arguably better known for her tearful Oscar acceptance speech than for the role that earned her the award, has never been loath to bring her family into the limelight. On that mysteriously overwrought occasion, she mentioned, among others, her mother and father, her brother, her grandfather, and a deceased cousin, thanking them for allowing her to 'understand love with a tremendous magnitude'. </p> <p>But most of these figures were not foreigners to fame - and they had already been publicly associated with Gwyneth for some time. Early in her career, much was made of her thespian pedigree. She was photographed with her arms around her mother, the actress Blythe Danner, and she often spoke with girlish fondness about her father, the director, writer and producer Bruce Paltrow. </p> <p>It had long been known that Gwyneth spent her early years in Hollywood, and that she was later offered a small role crucial to her future by Steven Spielberg, a family friend. Now Gwyneth has become so famous, however, that pedigree seems to be turning round almost to the point of total inversion. Blythe Danner, a talented actress, has been much more visible in films recently, and cynics inevitably argue that the Gwyneth connection has added to her appeal. And now, for the first time, Gwyneth has made a movie with her dad, who I met in London last week. </p> <p>Bruce Paltrow's film, Duets, has several plot strands, each of which concerns a character trying to escape from his or her life and finding a way out through karaoke. Gradually, these people form three pairs, who drive for miles and end up meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, for a karaoke grand finale that will earn the winner $5,000. Because of the multiple storylines, there is no true leading role, but your attention is effortlessly drawn to Gwyneth, the only star actress in the film. She plays a young Las Vegas showgirl, whose long-lost father turns out to be a karaoke hustler in the guise of the Eighties pop singer Huey Lewis. </p> <p>So what might be called the central couple is a father-daughter duo, rather than a romantic pairing, and it's noticeable that Gwyneth's character, the teenage Liv, is supposed to be a sexual innocent. At one point in the movie, the two have a row, in which Liv assures her father that she never had sex with Tom Jones, even though she slept in his bedroom. Meanwhile, she is wise to the hustle he performs in every bar; she's clean when it comes to sex and smart when it comes to money - a girl designed to please a father. Something Gwyneth once said about her father springs to mind - 'He told me, \"Do you know why we went to Paris, just you and me, and why Mommy and Jake stayed in London? I wanted you to see Paris for the first time with a man who will love you for ever, no matter what\".' Although Paltrow did not write the script for Duets , it almost looks like an overprotective, Oedipal fit of pique to eliminate romance from the film entirely. </p> <p>However, the film's casting had its origins in a more triangular arrangement. Five years ago, when the project started out, Brad Pitt was due to star - not in the Huey Lewis part, of course, but in a role eventually played by Scott Speedman, a nice-looking boy, the pinnacle of whose romantic achievements in the film is a flirtatious smile exchanged with Gwyneth. It's not hard to imagine that the dynamic of Duets would have been rather different had Pitt stayed on. But, Paltrow explains: 'When the kids broke up, I didn't want to hold him to it - he had agreed to do it out of affection for me.' </p> <p>This was, as he puts it, 'before Gwyneth's star had really risen'. Paltrow senior had worked mainly in television (he is best known for the hit series St Elsewhere, a hospital drama which was a precursor to shows like ER and Chicago Hope), and the studio was unwilling to finance the film when Pitt pulled out. But, as if by magic, Duets gained a star without having to cast a new one. Within a few years, Paltrow's daughter had become the source of the film's bankability and the project went ahead. </p> <p>The story, told like this, is tough on Paltrow, since it raises two difficult questions about his relationship with his child: one is whether he now has to depend on a ride on her coat-tails, and the other is about their connection to the father and daughter within the film. Just before they started shooting, Paltrow underwent radical surgery for throat cancer, and Gwyneth has said that her fear, 'just the thought of being without him, informed how I played the part'. The lost and found father in the film was linked up with the devoted father directing it. </p> <p>Armed with these facts, I arrive at the Dorchester hotel preparing to tread on some complicated territory. But as soon as Paltrow enters the room, all of those doubts begin to look like overelaborate and offensive suspicions. He is a warm, affable man, a classic New Yorker full of anecdotes and reminiscences, with a tendency to self-effacement. He has a leathery face, masked by glasses approaching the classic Michael Caine design, and a trim physique. He seems healthy; I don't know what he sounded like before his surgery, but he now has a quiet, gruff, lively voice - a sort of Fifth Avenue Mel Brooks. </p> <p>He talks straight and speaks easily about his family, the way any proud husband and father would. 'I can't take a good picture,' he says when the photographer arrives, 'unlike my daughter, who can't take a bad one. It's true. I have pictures of her since she was this high, and there's not a single bad one.' They seem to have an enviably happy life - Gwyneth's Oscar speech appears less like gush and more like an expression of good fortune - and although one can never know the ways in which happy families are or are not all like, on meeting Paltrow, my willingness to pry into this one all but crumbles. </p> <p>We talk about the film and the casting of Lewis. Paltrow says he thinks Lewis and Gwyneth are perfect together: 'I think he's so believable in that part.' I agree, although you wonder, I suggest, since the father hasn't seen his daughter all her life, if they're going to get together at the end. Paltrow looks shocked. I suppose you couldn't do that, I say, retreating. 'No,' he answers, 'you'd get put in prison.' </p> <p>Paltrow's next project is a script he has written about a widower who has two daughters. One daughter goes to college, the other lives in Paris. When he returns home, he finds he has nothing - no wife, no children, no job. So he goes to be with his daughter in Paris, and the film, Paltrow says, 'is about what happens to him there'. I ask him what interests him about the father-daughter relationship. 'In life,' he asks, 'or in film?' Both, I say, and he sighs, not knowing where to start. 'Oh, I think parents and their children... it's ongoing, always changing... you must have that with your own father...' Did the fact that they've always been so close make it difficult for Gwyneth to rebel? 'Oh, Gwyneth had no problem with that,' he laughs. 'I think she was a very happy adolescent - she did everything the other adolescents did - went to parties, ducked out of school.' </p> <p>Paltrow considers this the first time he has worked with his daughter, although he did cast her in a small TV role when she was five. Working with her was, he tells me, 'wonderful. Wonderful. When you work with your family you develop a shorthand. I'd know immediately if Gwyneth was uncom fortable with something she was doing, or happy or unhappy'. But mostly, he says, what was nice about the shoot was that 'the whole family was together for four weeks - my son came, my wife was there. We'll probably never have that again. It was fabulous'. </p> <p>Would he direct her again? 'I would do it not so fast again. I think because of the media, and being asked questions that have nothing to do with the movie.' Apologising in advance, I ask a question that has nothing to do with the movie. How did he feel when his daughter starred opposite Michael Douglas in A Perfect Murder, given that Douglas is a friend of Bruce Paltrow's, and Gwyneth was cast as his wife? 'Oh,' Paltrow replies, almost laughing at himself, 'that was the only time I sort of went, whoa...you're working with Michael? What are you talking about? What's going on here, this is disgusting! But Gwyneth said, \"Dad\" [he leans forward], she'd say, \" Dehhhhd \"... it's a shame you can't get the inflection of that in print. Then I thought, you know, they're actors.' </p> <p>People must ask him all the time how he feels about having a daughter more successful than him, I venture. 'Constantly. I hate that so much. I always say the same thing - I say I'm as proud and as happy as any father of any child who's successful. I was proud of her before she was famous and I'm proud of her now - she's my child.' But there's a saying, isn't there, that you should never beat your father at chess. 'Not where I come from,' Paltrow replies. 'In America, you always hope your children are more successful than you. My father did, and so did his father.' </p> <p>Paltrow's family originally came to New York from Russia. His great-grandfather was a rabbi. Though it's hard to imagine how you might outshine a rabbi, the family lore is that each generation exceeded the achievements of the last. His father, who worked in the steel business, was the first in his family to go to college, but he had only completed one year before the Depression prevented him from continuing. So, in fact, Bruce was the first. He studied art and thought, since he loved the movies and didn't really want to become a painter, that he would do something in an allied field, like scenic art. He met Blythe Danner when he was doing a play off Broadway ('She walked out on stage, and I was dazzled. That was in January, and we got married in December') and the couple moved to Hollywood, to try their luck - 'We'll see how it turns out,' Paltrow jokes. </p> <p>They arrived at a legendary moment, the brink of the period immortalised in Peter Biskind's book, Easy Riders, Raging Bulls. I ask Paltrow what Hollywood in the Seventies was like. 'Oh, gosh,' he sighs, 'you know, when you're in the middle of something you don't realise you're at a point of some significance. It's like Kierkegaard said, \"The curious thing about despair is when you're in it you don't know it\". When you're in the middle of something you have no idea how good it is either. We were just kids, you know. We were living on the beach. Blythe was pregnant with Gwyneth. We didn't have a television set, we had very little money. Everybody was going out with everybody else - we were like the married couple, so we were the quietest of the lot. We had charades - a lot of charades, a lot of basketball. We were just... kids. Everybody was kind of beginning.' </p> <p>He goes on, happy at the memory: 'The big star was Steven Spielberg. He already had a sports car. He had a directing deal with Universal, so we already knew that Steven was a big deal. He was doing The Name of the Game, a television series. I met Martin Scorsese then. He was cutting [Paltrow tries to remember] ... and he was cutting Boxcar Bertha, and Brian [De Palma] was preparing a shock movie called Sisters. Oh, gosh - it was just our generation. It was a wonderful time. I don't know what to tell ya, it was just a wonderful time.' </p> <p>The year here must be 1971, since the films Paltrow is talking about - not to mention the baby Blythe was pregnant with - came out in 1972. Paltrow tried his hand at writing scripts and then became a director and producer of TV shows. He found himself fascinated, then and now, by the same sort of subjects: 'Good people who struggle to succeed.' The theme was apparent in his cult series, The White Shadow , in which a white man teaches basketball, against the odds, in a black school, and in St Elsewhere, in which the best doctors fight to save lives in the hospital with the worst equipment. 'The world's a tough place,' Paltrow explains. 'I mean, there are only so many parking spaces and there's an awful lot of cars. Some people just have to work harder.' I ask if he considers himself to be one of those people and he thinks not: 'I can't say I was an underdog.' </p> <p>Paltrow prefers directing features (he directed one before Duets, a film called A Little Sex , which was released in 1982 and starred Spielberg's present wife, Kate Capshaw), but 'happenstance' has meant that he has earned his stripes in television. He speaks very articulately about the difference between the two, about how TV shows are designed for audiences who will be doing other things at the same time, about what TV directors can bring to the movies. 'John Frankenheimer, Michael Mann, Norman Jewison, Sydney Pollack - they all came from television. I would say anyone with enough help can direct a movie. In television, you have to know what you're doing. I set up all the shots - it's second nature to me - but I like spending more time on a picture, and not just churning things out.' </p> <p>Clearly, Paltrow knows how to make a film - he is a craftsman, of the kind that often gets lost in an era of auteurs. Though his TV shows always managed to plug into the Zeitgeist, he has yet to achieve such popularity in the movies. Whatever his future successes, he seems doomed to be known as 'Gwyneth's dad' - but then her upbringing is clearly also a project of which he's extremely proud. </p>",

Now Christopher McQuarrie, who won an Oscar for his screenplay for The Usual Suspects, makes his directorial debut with <strong> The Way of the Gun</strong>, and it isn't just the title of this thriller that is familiar. His film is the exhausted end of the line for a form of existential action movie that Sam Peckinpah began in the early 1970s, Walter Hill pared down in the 1980s, and Quentin Tarantino continued in a baroque manner in the 1990s. </p> <p>One of the earliest films in the cycle, The Getaway, was adapted for Peckinpah by Hill from Jim Thompson's pulp novel, and the part of the book they didn't use was turned by Tarantino into From Dusk Till Dawn, an action-cum-horror movie directed by Robert Rodriguez 25 years later. </p> <p>Whereas the dazzlingly postmodern The Usual Suspects was a clever sleight-of-hand commentary on thrillers, The Way of the Gun is merely pastiche. Benicio Del Toro (from The Usual Suspects) and Ryan Phillippe are two insouciant crooks who style themselves 'Longbaugh' and 'Parker' (the real names of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid), and kidnap a pregnant woman (Juliette Lewis, star of From Dusk Till Dawn). They cross the border into Mexico, that dark underside of the States, holding her to ransom. She's a surrogate mother, carrying the baby of an ageing, utterly corrupt tycoon and his young wife, and after them come a pair of ruthless bodyguards (Taye Diggs, Nicky Katt) and a demonic Mr Fixit (James Caan) who, as he puts it, does the tycoon's laundry. </p> <p>Everyone is always on his best menace and they converse using the sort of aphorisms you might have found in the crackers at Murder Inc's Christmas party (e.g. 'One shot is backfire, three is gunplay'; 'Certainty is more important than morality'; 'A plan is just a list of things that don't happen'). The tone is cool, the humour bizarre, the violence claustrophobically intense in the manner Hill developed, with gunfights staged at close quarters in cramped surroundings. </p> <p> The Way of the Gun is well staged and designed, and enjoyable enough. There's a terrific car chase at the outset. Nobody (not even Paul Newman) can express more with a shrug of his head or a shift of his shoulders than James Caan. The swivel-eyed Geoffrey Lewis, a major figure in the thrillers and westerns of the 1970s (and father of Juliette), has a splendid minor role as a reckless old crook who's first seen with a bottle of whisky and a cloth bag of assorted pistols playing his private version of Russian roulette. The trouble is that the lines we are invited to draw between the numbers of its formulaic narrative don't make a logical picture, and the characters for the most part repel our sympathy. </p> <p>James Toback's <strong> Black and White </strong> is an ambitious but addled investigation of race relations in New York, especially the phenomenon of middle-class white kids attracted by black culture and sexuality. The problem is that a semi-improvised picture that involves well-known actors working with actual sports and rap stars (some like Mike Tyson playing themselves) starts out as a sort of documentary and abruptly turns into a rather poorly conceived thriller about a college basketball player caught in a police sting operation. </p> <p>This is in fact an extension of the plot of The Gambler, the 1974 picture Toback wrote for Karel Reisz where a black basketball star is bribed by a transgressive white professor who recklessly seeks trouble in Harlem. </p> <p>Undoubtedly the highlight of Black and White is the scene in which Robert Downey Jr. as a gay documentary filmmaker makes an outrageous pass at Mike Tyson and leads the champ into a characteristic display of violence that endangers his parole. </p> <p>Screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel have written some good movies (City Slickers among them), but as the authors of Parenthood and Fathers' Day, they're much given to playing treacly versions of 'Home Sweet Home' on our heartstrings. Their outrageously sentimental <strong> Where The Heart Is</strong>, stars Natalie Portman as a fetching piece of trailer-park trash who's dropped off by her callous boyfriend in a small Oklahoma town when eight months pregnant. For several weeks she camps out in a branch of Wal-Mart, eventually delivering her baby there, becoming a TV celebrity as the Wal-Mart Mom. </p> <p>She christens her daughter Americus and finds a new life among the kindly, eccentric blue collar locals, forming a closed friendship with an unmarried mother with five children (Ashley Judd), losing her surrogate mother (Stockard Channing) in a tornado, becoming a successful photographer and winning the love of sensitive librarian James Frain. Meanwhile she continues to work at Wal-Mart and even stages her white wedding in the store, turning the movie into a two-hour commercial for a retail chain famously hostile to the political aspirations of those who shop and work there. </p> <p>Bruce Paltrow's directorial debut, <strong> Duets</strong>, also set in the American West, is an Altmanesque road movie about three sets of odd couples meeting up in Nevada, New Mexico and Ohio and converging in Omaha, Nebraska to participate in a $5,000 regional Grand Prize Karaoke Contest. They're a newly reunited father and daughter, an idealistic taxi-driver and a cynical singer, and a disgusted businessman in flight from capitalism and a black convict on the lam. Their paths to Omaha are paved with sentimental clich\u00e9s, and all find it a healing experience, especially the sacrificial black crook who ends up dead in a ludicrous climax. </p> <p>People have claimed to be impressed by the singing of Gwyneth Paltrow, the director's daughter, but the best musical performance comes from Andre Braugher (the convict) and Paul Giamatti (the disillusioned salesman), who render 'Try a Little Tenderness' in the style of Otis Redding. </p> <p>As Browning might have said had he and Elizabeth Barrett become a Hollywood screenwriting duo, 'dumb down along with me, the worst is yet to be'. Few things have been much worse to date than <strong> Little Nicky</strong>. In this Adam Sandler comedy, Satan (Harvey Keitel) sends his kindly, nerdish son Nicky (Sandler) from hell to New York in pursuit of his evil brothers, Cassius (Tiny Lister) and Adrian (Rhys Ifans), who threaten to destroy the world's delicate balance between good and evil. </p> <p>Made at considerable expense, it's crude, and brutally unfunny. It begins with Adolf Hitler parading on the dot at 4 o'clock dressed as a serving maid to have Satan shove a large pineapple up his rectum. It ends with the F\u00fchrer being - well, I've already been spoilsport enough. </p> <p>It was enterprising of Shane O'Sullivan to make <strong> Second Generation</strong>, his whimsical tale of young Asian folk in London's East End, on Digital Betacam for \u00a320,000 and then to get it shown in a West End cinema. </p> <p>However, as Bertrand Russell remarked when D.H. Lawrence published his collection of confessional verse, Look! We Have Come Through! : 'I'm pleased to hear they have come through, but is it necessary for us to look?'</p>",

      "body": "<p>Anomie is a disease which disproportionately afflicts French novelists. But even by the standards of the country that gave us Proust (a bedridden neurasthenic) and Sartre (the author of Nausea), Michel Houellebecq represents a particularly acute case. Houellebecq is France's biggest literary sensation in 20 years - and his suffering is enormous. </p> <p>To spend a weekend in his company is to become an unwitting participant in a sensory-deprivation experiment. External stimuli are reduced to a minimum. Physical movement is discouraged. Likewise, talking and eating, and any other activity that might detract from the primary objective - getting from Saturday morning to Sunday night with as little conscious awareness as possible. Living outside Dublin, where Houellebecq moved from Paris last year, helps: he knows almost no one in the city, and doesn't like to speak English.</p> <p>When I rang the bell of his suburban town house in June, I was the first person to have done so in quite some time. Houellebecq answered the door in stockinged feet, blinked at me with his sad, brown eyes and ushered me into the living room. He curled up in a chair with a pack of Silk Cuts and a bottle of Jim Beam and hardly moved for the entire weekend. He murmured obligingly in response to my questions, but finishing a sentence often proved beyond him. Whatever energy he had seemed mostly consumed by the quiet labour of existing.</p> <p>Houellebecq's wife, Marie-Pierre, came and went, refilling liquor glasses and emptying the ashtray. By late afternoon, the room was choked with smoke, and Houellebecq was no longer sober. Through a door, half hidden behind some drapes, was a balcony and directly beyond it the gray expanse of the Irish Sea. When I asked Houellebecq when the tide came in, he seemed taken aback. 'I know it moves,' he reflected, 'but we shut the curtains.'</p> <p>By the time we sat down to dinner - in the living room - he was too inebriated to eat. He picked at his boiled crab and got some of it on his sleeve. His head began to nod; his eyelids drooped. But for the first time all day, he looked almost cheerful. 'I am the star of French literature,' he slurred. 'The most radical one of all.' He reached over and petted my knee. 'What's your name again?' he mumbled. 'How would you like to be in my erotic film?' </p> <p> In France, Houellebecq (pronounced Well-beck) is famous for being a lot of things. Being a pitiful shut-in, however, is not one of them. To 20-somethings, he's a hero; to baby boomers, he's a menace to society. He is also considered by turns a pornographer, a Stalinist, a racist, a sexist, a nihilist, a reactionary, a eugenicist and a homophobe. About the only thing the French seem to agree on about Houellebecq is that he is the first French novelist since Balzac whose work captures the social realities of contemporary life.</p> <p>It's an extraordinary claim - all the more unlikely given Houellebecq's palpable aversion to the world. But then, 'extraordinary' is the word that best sums up Houellebecq's career. A few years ago, he was an obscure poet and recovering mental patient with a single novel under his belt and a day job debugging computers at the French parliament. Then in 1998, he published Les Particules El\u00e9mentaires (The Elementary Particles). A novel overflowing with anguish and graphic descriptions of anonymous sex, it sold 300,000 copies and incited a national verbal slugfest unlike anything France had ever seen. </p> <p>Debated on the front page of Le Monde and denounced by the Catholic press, the book bitterly divided the jury of the Prix Goncourt, France's top literary prize. (The award went to someone else.) Meanwhile, French Gen X'ers launched a Houellebecq fan club on the internet to discuss his philosophical kinship with Nietzsche and Celine. 'Suddenly, it's a question of agreeing or disagreeing with The Elementary Particles, the same way one had to agree or disagree with Picasso's Guernica,' Le Monde grumbled.</p> <p>Houellebecq is now, at 42, a wealthy one-man multimedia franchise. He has ventured into music (he has recorded a CD of his poems and tours France with a rock band) and TV (he is directing an erotic film for the Canal Plus network), and his face is splashed across billboards in the M\u00e9tro. Hoping that he will prove just as provocative - and bankable - in English, Knopf has brought out The Elementary Particles in translation this month, according it the kind of print run (40,000 copies) rarely lavished on a foreign novel.</p> <p>It's a quixotic wager. Houellebecq's book is an original work of art - ironic, intelligent and as airtight and elegant as a geometry proof. It is also considerably bleaker than any French sex-and-death novel in recent memory. The Elementary Particles tells the story of Bruno and Michel, a pair of half-brothers who are palmed off to grandparents at a tender age by irresponsible hippie parents. Bruno grows up to become a self-loathing, sex-obsessed psychiatric patient who, though 'prepared to go to the ends of the earth' for nubile flesh 'wrapped in a miniskirt', is rarely satisfied. He abandons the one woman who loves him, when she becomes a wheelchair-bound invalid. As for Michel, he becomes a chronically depressed molecular biologist who commits suicide off the Irish coast - but not without leaving a blueprint for establishing a new species of perfectly rational human clones, the only hope for saving mankind from self-destruction.</p> <p>The wretched characters, affectless prose and clinical descriptions of group sex ('Bruno and Rudi took turns penetrating Hannelore') are deeply disturbing. But the French took exception to something else: the book's militant ideology. The Elementary Particles takes pains to ensure that we don't see Bruno and Michel merely as products of bad parenting or dumb luck. Rather, they are victims of a culture awash in post-1960s values. Over the course of the novel's 272 pages, Houellebecq catalogues a daunting number of alleged scourges - the free market, New Age mysticism, legal abortion, skyrocketing divorce rates, materialism, debauchery - and lays them at the door of counterculture idealism. According to the novel's freewheeling historical logic, the 1960s begat not peace and prosperity but selfishness, misery and violence. 'In a sense,' muses Bruno in a characteristic aside, 'the serial killers of the 1990s were the spiritual children of the hippies of the 60s.' For those fortunate enough to have avoided a criminal fate, the book implies, loneliness is the reward. 'We live in a world in which there are no more links,' Houellebecq told me. 'We're just particles. It's a simple metaphor.' </p> <p>His biggest gripe, however, is about what has happened to sex. The Parisian swingers' club that Bruno frequents is the apotheosis of sexual liberation gone awry. Erotic possibilities abound, but sex in the club is ultimately another free-market competition, a contest stacked in favour of the strongest and most beautiful. Bruno doesn't make the cut. He ends up checking into a mental hospital, where he plans to spend the rest of his days on a regimen of drugs that kill his libido. </p> <p>'In France, the sexual revolution never stopped,' Houellebecq said. 'Now you can do what you want. The problem is that people take no more pleasure in sex. For example, more and more white women don't want to go out with white men. They aren't virile enough. And white men, they want to go out with black or Arab women. It's not a question of race, but that sex is still forbidden to these women. That's the ideal: when you have freedom, but it's new.' </p> <p>It is reckless armchair sociologising like this that gets him into trouble, a fact he cavalierly dismisses. 'What I write is the truth,' he told me serenely. Many Parisians disagree. In France, Houellebecq is infamous for giving Michel, his biologist anti-hero, the same last name - Djerzinski - as a high-ranking Stalinist official and then defending the gesture by saying Stalin wasn't such a bad guy. After all, Houellebecq told a French magazine that Stalin 'killed a lot of anarchists'. His antipathy for democracy ('Liberty is equivalent to suffering,' he said on French TV) has caused much hand-wringing among the intelligentsia. His confidence, however, remains unshakable. 'I find myself morally perfect,' he said. Or, as Marie-Pierre put it: 'Michel's not depressed. It's the world that's depressing.' </p> <p>Initially, Houellebecq set out to change the world. His first novel, L'Extension du Domaine de la Lutte (Extension of the Battlefield), which appeared in 1994, features a physically repellent software technician whose unrealistic obsession is to find a woman who will have sex with him. Instead of losing his virginity, he ends up losing his life in a car crash. Houellebecq believed the book would force people to reconsider the premium we place on physical beauty. 'I was certain the novel would provoke social change,' he said. 'Now I think it was megalomania. When you go into a club today, you see the same behaviour as six years ago. A novel won't ever change the world.' </p> <p>With The Elementary Particles, Houellebecq abandoned his fantasy of fixing the world and tried to imagine a more perfect one instead. The society of human clones at the end of the book approximates Houellebecq's idea of utopia. Freed from the shackles of sexual reproduction, Darwinian competitiveness vanishes. Gone, too, are egotism, violence and greed. As for sex, it exists purely for fun: equipped with pleasure sensors taken from the genitals of both sexes and distributed over the epidermis, each clone is a hermaphrodite destined to a life of 'new and undreamed-of erotic possibilities'. Houellebecq - who maintains an open marriage, frequents swingers' clubs and estimates that he sleeps with 25 women a year - said that he couldn't imagine anything nicer than 'having clitorises all over your body'. </p> <p>Is Houellebecq, the sexual libertine, guilty of not practicing what he preaches? 'He's interesting because he's so contradictory,' said Frederic Beigbeder, a French novelist. 'He says the world is a nightmare, because we are creatures of our desires, and that individual liberty drives us to destruction and despair. He says all this, but he does the exact opposite in his life. In a sense, he is the ultimate example of what he hates.' </p> <p>Houellebecq's friends don't wonder at his self-imposed exile abroad. They wonder at his being alive at all. 'He has suffered a lot,' Beigbeder said. 'I think he has come back from a place where a normal person would have committed suicide. And that explains everything.' He was born on the French island of R\u00e9union, off the coast of Madagascar, in 1958, the son of a mountain-guide father and a physician mother. Like the parents of his ill-starred protagonists, Houellebecq's own were hippies, committed neither to each other nor to child rearing, and at the age of six, Michel was shipped off to a grandmother south-west of Paris. He has no idea where his parents are today - or even if they are alive. </p> <p>During high school, Houellebecq spent hours by himself watching trains at the station next door. 'I would get on them and go nowhere,' he recalled. 'Just get on, get off.' He was frequently depressed. Beigbeder realised just how depressed one evening not long ago, when he popped a Moody Blues ballad into his CD player and saw Houellebecq burst into tears: 'He started crying, crying. Finally he explained that at all the parties when he was 18, all the boys and girls slow-danced to this song, but he was alone and no one talked to him because he was ugly.' Then again, Beigbeder said dryly, Houellebecq 'loves pathetic - all his work is about being pathetic'. </p> <p>At 18, Houellebecq was rejected for French military service because of a morphine addiction. In 1980, he graduated from college with a degree in agricultural engineering. He married, had a son and divorced. Within a few years, he was unemployed, drinking heavily and in and out of mental hospitals, where he was treated for anxiety. 'Until I met writers, the most interesting people I knew were in asylums,' he said. Around the same time, he began to publish poems. But it wasn't until he took a job as a software technician in 1991 that he found his true subject as a novelist - the everyday routine of a working stiff. </p> <p> L'Extension du Domaine de la Lutte contains the first articulation of Houellebecq's grand theme: free choice for all is misery for most. 'In a perfectly liberal economic system, some will accumulate considerable fortunes; others will wallow in unemployment and misery,' explains his narrator. 'In a perfectly liberal sexual system, some will enjoy a varied and exciting erotic life; others will be reduced to masturbation and solitude.' Virtually ignored by the press, the book sold 20,000 copies thanks to word of mouth. The succ\u00e8s de scandale of The Elementary Particles four years later assured his literary ascendancy. </p> <p>It was a remarkable coup. In a country where writers are overwhelmingly upper class and products of the grandes \u00e9coles, Houellebecq was an affront. He was a petit bourgeois from the provinces with a trade-school degree. Moreover, he was indifferent to French literature. His closest precursor was the British writer Aldous Huxley, whose Brave New World is equally obsessed with eugenics. His favourite book was The Magic Mountain, Thomas Mann's philosophical novel set in an asylum. 'In the French tradition, it's completely odd to put ideas in a novel,' Houellebecq said.</p> <p>In some ways, Houellebecq's outsider status has actually worked to his advantage. For decades, French literature has foundered. The stalwarts of postwar fiction, novelists like Nathalie Sarraute, Marguerite Duras and Alain Robbe-Grillet, are either retired or dead, and the nouveau roman - a plotless, characterless exercise in abstraction - is widely considered an unreadable snooze. 'For years, French novelists haven't dared attack the big subjects,' lamented Fran\u00e7ois Nourissier, president of the Prix Goncourt. 'There was the war in Algeria. Not a single novel! There has been this extraordinary upheaval in French society, which has become multiracial. No novel.' </p> <p>Houellebecq's novel certainly attacks a big subject. But to write, as he does, that the 1960s were a fraud - that the student riots of May 1968 were more about errant individualism than glowing idealism - is seen by the liberal establishment as tantamount to sedition. 'We're all crushed by the weight of the 60s - in cinema, music, books,' said Guillaume Durand, a French talk-show host. 'And here's Houellebecq saying the 60s were nothing. It made people hate him.' </p> <p>It also made him rich and famous, although hanging out with him in Dublin, you would never know it. His wardrobe - a pair of dingy chinos and a couple of flannel shirts - suggests graduate-student asceticism. Ditto his diet: coffee and tobacco leavened by the occasional bender. ('I don't like to eat,' he told me. 'I only like sex.') The bookshelves in his town house are cheap, and the wallpaper is beginning to peel. (Houellebecq and Marie-Pierre, whom he married in 1998, plan to move to a house on an island off the south-west coast of Ireland where there are more sheep than people.) Houellebecq said that having money has changed his life in one crucial respect only: it has allowed him to escape 'the nightmare' of being an employee. Fame is a more ambiguous blessing. 'It is too much pressure,' he complained. Then again, he conceded, 'my sex life is richer.' </p> <p>But even that perk can't be depended upon to make celebrity worth the hassle required to maintain it. In July, Houellebecq left his Dublin hideaway to spend a week in Paris tending to his career. The trip produced nothing but irritation. At Flammarion, his publishing house, he met with his editor to discuss his latest work, a novella due out next month that features an actual extraterrestrial-worshiping cult on the Canary Islands. Fearing a lawsuit, Houellebecq's editor urged him to change the name of the cult. Houellebecq resisted. 'But I write about reality,' he grumbled.</p> <p>He also met with a costume designer about the erotic short he is directing for Canal Plus. No one seemed to be keeping pace with the production schedule, and Houellebecq, who envisioned an all-female cast and a fairy-tale plot line that would allow for 'more shots of pleasure than of organs', still had only one actress lined up - his wife. He found a fresh prospect in the form of a lanky young publicist at Flammarion. When he complained to her about his troubles with the film, she volunteered for a part. 'But you haven't even seen the script,' he said dubiously. 'I don't care,' she replied. He dutifully took down her name and address, but even her evident enthusiasm - with its hint of sexual availability - failed to lift his spirits. </p> <p>He had talked about going to Chris et Manu, a swingers' club, on Friday night, but when I called him, he was having second thoughts. He suggested I drop by his apartment in a see-through skirt instead. 'I don't really want to go out,' he said. 'I just want to have sex.' When this failed to elicit the response he was looking for, he made a feeble attempt at blackmail. 'We have reached the limit of talking,' he said. 'There are things only people who have physical relations with me get to hear.' When that, too, fell flat, he lapsed into a melancholy monologue. 'The journalist is the enemy of the groupie,' he said. 'The groupie exists just to have sex with. The journalist wants an interview, and the journalist usually wins. I'm on the side of the groupie, but I'm too passive to put up a fight.' Before I hung up, I asked him what he was going to do. 'Go to bed,' he sighed. It was eight o'clock. </p> <p>Fortunately, Houellebecq has a few other ways of distracting himself besides sex. Writing, for example. There are always aspects of contemporary life to repudiate. He is already working on his next novel, which will be set in Thailand and include a broadside against Muslim fundamentalism. Then, of course, there is the living room in Dublin, the pack of Silk Cuts, the bottle of Jim Beam. Halfway through dinner on the night I visited, Houellebecq fell into a drunken stupor, his nodding head eventually landing on his plate next to a smear of mayonnaise. As the light faded outside and Marie-Pierre and I continued to talk, Houellebecq slept on. The last time I saw him that night, he was still slumped in his chair with his head against the table, the posture of a man engaged in a silent protest against the world.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Anomie is a disease which disproportionately afflicts French novelists. But even by the standards of the country that gave us Proust (a bedridden neurasthenic) and Sartre (the author of Nausea), Michel Houellebecq represents a particularly acute case. Houellebecq is France's biggest literary sensation in 20 years - and his suffering is enormous. To spend a weekend in his company is to become an unwitting participant in a sensory-deprivation experiment. External stimuli are reduced to a minimum. Physical movement is discouraged. Likewise, talking and eating, and any other activity that might detract from the primary objective - getting from Saturday morning to Sunday night with as little conscious awareness as possible. Living outside Dublin, where Houellebecq moved from Paris last year, helps: he knows almost no one in the city, and doesn't like to speak English. When I rang the bell of his suburban town house in June, I was the first person to have done so in quite some time. Houellebecq answered the door in stockinged feet, blinked at me with his sad, brown eyes and ushered me into the living room. He curled up in a chair with a pack of Silk Cuts and a bottle of Jim Beam and hardly moved for the entire weekend. He murmured obligingly in response to my questions, but finishing a sentence often proved beyond him. Whatever energy he had seemed mostly consumed by the quiet labour of existing. Houellebecq's wife, Marie-Pierre, came and went, refilling liquor glasses and emptying the ashtray. By late afternoon, the room was choked with smoke, and Houellebecq was no longer sober. Through a door, half hidden behind some drapes, was a balcony and directly beyond it the gray expanse of the Irish Sea. When I asked Houellebecq when the tide came in, he seemed taken aback. 'I know it moves,' he reflected, 'but we shut the curtains.' By the time we sat down to dinner - in the living room - he was too inebriated to eat. He picked at his boiled crab and got some of it on his sleeve. His head began to nod; his eyelids drooped. But for the first time all day, he looked almost cheerful. 'I am the star of French literature,' he slurred. 'The most radical one of all.' He reached over and petted my knee. 'What's your name again?' he mumbled. 'How would you like to be in my erotic film?' In France, Houellebecq (pronounced Well-beck) is famous for being a lot of things. Being a pitiful shut-in, however, is not one of them. To 20-somethings, he's a hero; to baby boomers, he's a menace to society. He is also considered by turns a pornographer, a Stalinist, a racist, a sexist, a nihilist, a reactionary, a eugenicist and a homophobe. About the only thing the French seem to agree on about Houellebecq is that he is the first French novelist since Balzac whose work captures the social realities of contemporary life. It's an extraordinary claim - all the more unlikely given Houellebecq's palpable aversion to the world. But then, 'extraordinary' is the word that best sums up Houellebecq's career. A few years ago, he was an obscure poet and recovering mental patient with a single novel under his belt and a day job debugging computers at the French parliament. Then in 1998, he published Les Particules El\u00e9mentaires (The Elementary Particles). A novel overflowing with anguish and graphic descriptions of anonymous sex, it sold 300,000 copies and incited a national verbal slugfest unlike anything France had ever seen. Debated on the front page of Le Monde and denounced by the Catholic press, the book bitterly divided the jury of the Prix Goncourt, France's top literary prize. (The award went to someone else.) Meanwhile, French Gen X'ers launched a Houellebecq fan club on the internet to discuss his philosophical kinship with Nietzsche and Celine. 'Suddenly, it's a question of agreeing or disagreeing with The Elementary Particles, the same way one had to agree or disagree with Picasso's Guernica,' Le Monde grumbled. Houellebecq is now, at 42, a wealthy one-man multimedia franchise. He has ventured into music (he has recorded a CD of his poems and tours France with a rock band) and TV (he is directing an erotic film for the Canal Plus network), and his face is splashed across billboards in the M\u00e9tro. Hoping that he will prove just as provocative - and bankable - in English, Knopf has brought out The Elementary Particles in translation this month, according it the kind of print run (40,000 copies) rarely lavished on a foreign novel. It's a quixotic wager. Houellebecq's book is an original work of art - ironic, intelligent and as airtight and elegant as a geometry proof. It is also considerably bleaker than any French sex-and-death novel in recent memory. The Elementary Particles tells the story of Bruno and Michel, a pair of half-brothers who are palmed off to grandparents at a tender age by irresponsible hippie parents. Bruno grows up to become a self-loathing, sex-obsessed psychiatric patient who, though 'prepared to go to the ends of the earth' for nubile flesh 'wrapped in a miniskirt', is rarely satisfied. He abandons the one woman who loves him, when she becomes a wheelchair-bound invalid. As for Michel, he becomes a chronically depressed molecular biologist who commits suicide off the Irish coast - but not without leaving a blueprint for establishing a new species of perfectly rational human clones, the only hope for saving mankind from self-destruction. The wretched characters, affectless prose and clinical descriptions of group sex ('Bruno and Rudi took turns penetrating Hannelore') are deeply disturbing. But the French took exception to something else: the book's militant ideology. The Elementary Particles takes pains to ensure that we don't see Bruno and Michel merely as products of bad parenting or dumb luck. Rather, they are victims of a culture awash in post-1960s values. Over the course of the novel's 272 pages, Houellebecq catalogues a daunting number of alleged scourges - the free market, New Age mysticism, legal abortion, skyrocketing divorce rates, materialism, debauchery - and lays them at the door of counterculture idealism. According to the novel's freewheeling historical logic, the 1960s begat not peace and prosperity but selfishness, misery and violence. 'In a sense,' muses Bruno in a characteristic aside, 'the serial killers of the 1990s were the spiritual children of the hippies of the 60s.' For those fortunate enough to have avoided a criminal fate, the book implies, loneliness is the reward. 'We live in a world in which there are no more links,' Houellebecq told me. 'We're just particles. It's a simple metaphor.' His biggest gripe, however, is about what has happened to sex. The Parisian swingers' club that Bruno frequents is the apotheosis of sexual liberation gone awry. Erotic possibilities abound, but sex in the club is ultimately another free-market competition, a contest stacked in favour of the strongest and most beautiful. Bruno doesn't make the cut. He ends up checking into a mental hospital, where he plans to spend the rest of his days on a regimen of drugs that kill his libido. 'In France, the sexual revolution never stopped,' Houellebecq said. 'Now you can do what you want. The problem is that people take no more pleasure in sex. For example, more and more white women don't want to go out with white men. They aren't virile enough. And white men, they want to go out with black or Arab women. It's not a question of race, but that sex is still forbidden to these women. That's the ideal: when you have freedom, but it's new.' It is reckless armchair sociologising like this that gets him into trouble, a fact he cavalierly dismisses. 'What I write is the truth,' he told me serenely. Many Parisians disagree. In France, Houellebecq is infamous for giving Michel, his biologist anti-hero, the same last name - Djerzinski - as a high-ranking Stalinist official and then defending the gesture by saying Stalin wasn't such a bad guy. After all, Houellebecq told a French magazine that Stalin 'killed a lot of anarchists'. His antipathy for democracy ('Liberty is equivalent to suffering,' he said on French TV) has caused much hand-wringing among the intelligentsia. His confidence, however, remains unshakable. 'I find myself morally perfect,' he said. Or, as Marie-Pierre put it: 'Michel's not depressed. It's the world that's depressing.' Initially, Houellebecq set out to change the world. His first novel, L'Extension du Domaine de la Lutte (Extension of the Battlefield), which appeared in 1994, features a physically repellent software technician whose unrealistic obsession is to find a woman who will have sex with him. Instead of losing his virginity, he ends up losing his life in a car crash. Houellebecq believed the book would force people to reconsider the premium we place on physical beauty. 'I was certain the novel would provoke social change,' he said. 'Now I think it was megalomania. When you go into a club today, you see the same behaviour as six years ago. A novel won't ever change the world.' With The Elementary Particles, Houellebecq abandoned his fantasy of fixing the world and tried to imagine a more perfect one instead. The society of human clones at the end of the book approximates Houellebecq's idea of utopia. Freed from the shackles of sexual reproduction, Darwinian competitiveness vanishes. Gone, too, are egotism, violence and greed. As for sex, it exists purely for fun: equipped with pleasure sensors taken from the genitals of both sexes and distributed over the epidermis, each clone is a hermaphrodite destined to a life of 'new and undreamed-of erotic possibilities'. Houellebecq - who maintains an open marriage, frequents swingers' clubs and estimates that he sleeps with 25 women a year - said that he couldn't imagine anything nicer than 'having clitorises all over your body'. Is Houellebecq, the sexual libertine, guilty of not practicing what he preaches? 'He's interesting because he's so contradictory,' said Frederic Beigbeder, a French novelist. 'He says the world is a nightmare, because we are creatures of our desires, and that individual liberty drives us to destruction and despair. He says all this, but he does the exact opposite in his life. In a sense, he is the ultimate example of what he hates.' Houellebecq's friends don't wonder at his self-imposed exile abroad. They wonder at his being alive at all. 'He has suffered a lot,' Beigbeder said. 'I think he has come back from a place where a normal person would have committed suicide. And that explains everything.' He was born on the French island of R\u00e9union, off the coast of Madagascar, in 1958, the son of a mountain-guide father and a physician mother. Like the parents of his ill-starred protagonists, Houellebecq's own were hippies, committed neither to each other nor to child rearing, and at the age of six, Michel was shipped off to a grandmother south-west of Paris. He has no idea where his parents are today - or even if they are alive. During high school, Houellebecq spent hours by himself watching trains at the station next door. 'I would get on them and go nowhere,' he recalled. 'Just get on, get off.' He was frequently depressed. Beigbeder realised just how depressed one evening not long ago, when he popped a Moody Blues ballad into his CD player and saw Houellebecq burst into tears: 'He started crying, crying. Finally he explained that at all the parties when he was 18, all the boys and girls slow-danced to this song, but he was alone and no one talked to him because he was ugly.' Then again, Beigbeder said dryly, Houellebecq 'loves pathetic - all his work is about being pathetic'. At 18, Houellebecq was rejected for French military service because of a morphine addiction. In 1980, he graduated from college with a degree in agricultural engineering. He married, had a son and divorced. Within a few years, he was unemployed, drinking heavily and in and out of mental hospitals, where he was treated for anxiety. 'Until I met writers, the most interesting people I knew were in asylums,' he said. Around the same time, he began to publish poems. But it wasn't until he took a job as a software technician in 1991 that he found his true subject as a novelist - the everyday routine of a working stiff. L'Extension du Domaine de la Lutte contains the first articulation of Houellebecq's grand theme: free choice for all is misery for most. 'In a perfectly liberal economic system, some will accumulate considerable fortunes; others will wallow in unemployment and misery,' explains his narrator. 'In a perfectly liberal sexual system, some will enjoy a varied and exciting erotic life; others will be reduced to masturbation and solitude.' Virtually ignored by the press, the book sold 20,000 copies thanks to word of mouth. The succ\u00e8s de scandale of The Elementary Particles four years later assured his literary ascendancy. It was a remarkable coup. In a country where writers are overwhelmingly upper class and products of the grandes \u00e9coles, Houellebecq was an affront. He was a petit bourgeois from the provinces with a trade-school degree. Moreover, he was indifferent to French literature. His closest precursor was the British writer Aldous Huxley, whose Brave New World is equally obsessed with eugenics. His favourite book was The Magic Mountain, Thomas Mann's philosophical novel set in an asylum. 'In the French tradition, it's completely odd to put ideas in a novel,' Houellebecq said. In some ways, Houellebecq's outsider status has actually worked to his advantage. For decades, French literature has foundered. The stalwarts of postwar fiction, novelists like Nathalie Sarraute, Marguerite Duras and Alain Robbe-Grillet, are either retired or dead, and the nouveau roman - a plotless, characterless exercise in abstraction - is widely considered an unreadable snooze. 'For years, French novelists haven't dared attack the big subjects,' lamented Fran\u00e7ois Nourissier, president of the Prix Goncourt. 'There was the war in Algeria. Not a single novel! There has been this extraordinary upheaval in French society, which has become multiracial. No novel.' Houellebecq's novel certainly attacks a big subject. But to write, as he does, that the 1960s were a fraud - that the student riots of May 1968 were more about errant individualism than glowing idealism - is seen by the liberal establishment as tantamount to sedition.

What makes Wood's latest book so refreshing is the sense that his research wasn't conducted in some dusty archive, but in the field. The author's all-consuming curiosity makes this doubly enticing, without a trace of jingoism, tempered by scientific rationalism; the book IS full of 'electric moments when the manuscript sleuth strikes gold'. The Million Dollar Mermaid Esther Williams, with Digby Diehl Simon &amp; Schuster Pocket Books \u00a37.99, pp416 Buy it at BOL Williams was made and ruined by extraordinary luck, but she's survived through equally extraordinary resourcefulness to tell her tale. While working at a pool, the lifeguards taught Williams the butterfly (then, an almost exclusively male pursuit). When she consequently broke freestyle records, she became a pinup and within a few years one of Hollywood's leading-ladies during the Forties. Just as fortuitously, she got involved in swimsuit design after she was caught skinny-dipping on set by tourists. Her 'aqua-musicals' may have epitomised camp, but Williams comes across as mentally tough as any synchronised swimmer must be. Besides dropping acid on Cary Grant's advice and 'test-driving' Howard Hughes's hospital bed, Williams found time for an affair with a transvestite and foiled a Las Vegas casino's colour bar by disguising her black nanny as 'the Maharani of Jodhpur'. A sensational life; a sensational read. The Fish Can Sing Halldor Laxness translated by Magnus Magnusson Harvill \u00a310.99, pp246 Buy it at BOL 'It is good and lovely to sing... especially if one is aiming at nothing higher than to sing over the clay of people who have no faces,' writes 1955's Nobel Prize winner at the end of his novel, set in Iceland at the turn of the century. Alfgrimur, an orphan raised by lumpfishers, describes an old world on the brink of the modern era and how he became the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iceland's most celebrated singer. Icelanders aren't bleak, so much as blessed with a refined sense of humour and an ability to see the Hand of God in even the smallest things, making for an uplifting novel. When the Wind Changed: The Life and Death of Tony Hancock Cliff Goodwin Arrow \u00a38.99, pp593 Buy it at BOL The Goons and the Carry On team may be more influential on modern comedy, but in his heyday, Hancock was the one-man phenomenon who, in popularity, surpassed both. Loathing catchphrases and 'musical numbers', abusive to pantomime audiences and ever 'costumed' in well-worn clothes, Hancock was a new kind of comedian for the postwar years. The weight of the world has always been less easily carried by solo performers and having lost his father (one of radio's first comedians) and brother at an early age, Hancock's alcoholism precipitated his suicide at 44. No diary is left unopened to reconstruct the complex life of a man whose public appearance was 'shabbily endearing' but who was privately a superstitious but philosophical atheist, prone to violence and depression. This is exhaustive, but never exhausting, with plenty of light relief in the form of transcribed interviews and sketches. De Sade's Valet Nikolaj Frobenius Marion Boyars \u00a39.95, pp239 Buy it at BOL If a sense of others' physical and mental suffering is essential to the development of a moral conscience, what happens when an emotionally dysfunctional libertine and a physiologically dysfunctional person hook up? Whoring, hell-raising and human vivisection, for sure, but precious little philosophical speculation. What about the mind-body question? Who cares? Pass the virgins! Confused, egotistical, but far from insane, de Sade was only a mildly interesting moral theorist at best and, as it transpires, his valet was the more devoted student of cruelty. Being incapable of experiencing pain, Latour studies neuro-anatomy to locate the hypothetical organ of pain, avenging his mother's death by procuring 'cadavers' from her list of creditors, as the pair sodomise their way through eighteenth-century France. Sadly, the ultra-simplistic writing and erratic plotting don't do justice to what is little more than a bonkbuster-cum-skullbuster.",

Every page of this remarkable little volume reminds us what every woman and every patient knows: that we live in our bodies, and that when our bodies let us down we have to face up to some very big questions.

The two Alice books inspired by it, which are many people's favourites, have become part of our imaginative landscape.</p> <p>Within a generation of first appearing in print, the characters in these books had become common currency whose best lines had passed into the language. </p> <p>Though the dark currents that swirl beneath the surface of this story are ones we can identify with, there's much about it that's remote and rather baffling. Dodgson's courtship was profoundly Victorian: he rowed Alice (and her sisters) on long boat rides up the Thames from Oxford. He wooed her with bizarre drawings, comic fairy tales, parodic rhymes and childish games. </p> <p>Adopting another persona - Lewis Carroll - he took her into the place he called 'Wonderland' and subjected her to all kinds of disagreeable imaginary friends, from the child-beating mother (the Duchess) to the psychotic chaperone (the Queen of Hearts). </p> <p>Amid the shelf-loads of exegesis inspired by these strange and extraordinary books, there's one (just as extraordinary) that's always stood out. For nearly half a century, American mathematician and part-time conjuror Martin Gardner's Annotated Alice has reigned supreme as the eccentric and engrossing commentary on manifold conundrums offered by Carroll's text. </p> <p>If you want to know the source for the Mad Hatter, or the answer to 'Why is a raven like a writing desk?' or the inspiration for the Walrus and the Carpenter, then Gardner is your man. If you need an explanation to the Carrollian puzzles of Abstraction, Uglification and Derision, Gardner will tirelessly (and sometimes tediously) be your guide, with an insatiable appetite for Victorian trivia. </p> <p>The American provenance of the book is occasionally irritating. To the British reader, notes like the one that informs us 'Barley sugar is a transparent, brittle candy, usually in twisted-stick form, still sold in England' are redundant. These, however, are mere quibbles. In the batty world of Carroll scholarship, Martin Gardner is the undisputed king. </p> <p>He's an amateur enthusiast, but an engaging one. During the years when he wrote a mathematics column for Scientific American, Gardner built up a worldwide audience of Carroll anoraks (scientists, computer nerds, schoolchildren, poets and fantasists), who liked to correspond with him about cruxes in the text of Wonderland. </p> <p>The fruit of these exchanges, the first edition of The Annotated Alice, was published as long ago as 1960; a sequel, More Annotated Alice, came out in 1990. </p> <p>Now in the aftermath of Dodgson's centenary, Penguin have produced Gardner's last word on this subject, a beautiful hardcover The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition (Allen Lane \u00a320, pp334), illustrated with Tenniel's famous drawings and supplemented with Dodgson's sketches, many of them recently discovered. </p> <p>This volume also includes a fascinating 'suppressed' episode from Through the Looking Glass, 'The Wasp in a Wig', an odd little scene deleted by Carroll from the second Alice book after Tenniel complained that he couldn't draw a wasp and thought the text better without it (he was right). </p> <p>This new edition also contains a select bibliography to illustrate the range of Carroll studies, from 'Psychoanalytic Remarks on Alice in Wonderland and Lewis Carroll' in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases to Charles Dodgson, Semiotician by Daniel F. Kirk. Regrettably, Mr Gardner does not mention the best single essay on Carroll, Hugh Haughton's introduction to the Penguin Classics edition of Alice in Wonderland, but in almost all other matters he is encyclopedic.</p> <p>The Annotated Alice probably tells us more than we want to know about the subconscious world of these haunting stories. It cannot, of course, begin to explain the greatest conundrum of all: the tantalising and disturbing character of the stammering Charles Dodgson, the childlike Oxford don who loved to play with little girls. </p> <p>It is, none the less, the indispensable guide to a classic of English literature, and no one who has ever wondered about the meaning of 'Jabberwocky' should fail to include on their Christmas list. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk\">robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Within a generation of first appearing in print, the characters in these books had become common currency whose best lines had passed into the language. Though the dark currents that swirl beneath the surface of this story are ones we can identify with, there's much about it that's remote and rather baffling. Dodgson's courtship was profoundly Victorian: he rowed Alice (and her sisters) on long boat rides up the Thames from Oxford. He wooed her with bizarre drawings, comic fairy tales, parodic rhymes and childish games. Adopting another persona - Lewis Carroll - he took her into the place he called 'Wonderland' and subjected her to all kinds of disagreeable imaginary friends, from the child-beating mother (the Duchess) to the psychotic chaperone (the Queen of Hearts). Amid the shelf-loads of exegesis inspired by these strange and extraordinary books, there's one (just as extraordinary) that's always stood out. For nearly half a century, American mathematician and part-time conjuror Martin Gardner's Annotated Alice has reigned supreme as the eccentric and engrossing commentary on manifold conundrums offered by Carroll's text. If you want to know the source for the Mad Hatter, or the answer to 'Why is a raven like a writing desk?' or the inspiration for the Walrus and the Carpenter, then Gardner is your man. If you need an explanation to the Carrollian puzzles of Abstraction, Uglification and Derision, Gardner will tirelessly (and sometimes tediously) be your guide, with an insatiable appetite for Victorian trivia. The American provenance of the book is occasionally irritating. To the British reader, notes like the one that informs us 'Barley sugar is a transparent, brittle candy, usually in twisted-stick form, still sold in England' are redundant. These, however, are mere quibbles. In the batty world of Carroll scholarship, Martin Gardner is the undisputed king. He's an amateur enthusiast, but an engaging one. During the years when he wrote a mathematics column for Scientific American, Gardner built up a worldwide audience of Carroll anoraks (scientists, computer nerds, schoolchildren, poets and fantasists), who liked to correspond with him about cruxes in the text of Wonderland. The fruit of these exchanges, the first edition of The Annotated Alice, was published as long ago as 1960; a sequel, More Annotated Alice, came out in 1990. Now in the aftermath of Dodgson's centenary, Penguin have produced Gardner's last word on this subject, a beautiful hardcover The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition (Allen Lane \u00a320, pp334), illustrated with Tenniel's famous drawings and supplemented with Dodgson's sketches, many of them recently discovered. This volume also includes a fascinating 'suppressed' episode from Through the Looking Glass, 'The Wasp in a Wig', an odd little scene deleted by Carroll from the second Alice book after Tenniel complained that he couldn't draw a wasp and thought the text better without it (he was right). This new edition also contains a select bibliography to illustrate the range of Carroll studies, from 'Psychoanalytic Remarks on Alice in Wonderland and Lewis Carroll' in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases to Charles Dodgson, Semiotician by Daniel F. Kirk. Regrettably, Mr Gardner does not mention the best single essay on Carroll, Hugh Haughton's introduction to the Penguin Classics edition of Alice in Wonderland, but in almost all other matters he is encyclopedic. The Annotated Alice probably tells us more than we want to know about the subconscious world of these haunting stories. It cannot, of course, begin to explain the greatest conundrum of all: the tantalising and disturbing character of the stammering Charles Dodgson, the childlike Oxford don who loved to play with little girls. It is, none the less, the indispensable guide to a classic of English literature, and no one who has ever wondered about the meaning of 'Jabberwocky' should fail to include on their Christmas list. robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk",

Frances and Ralph were not much more than literary hangers-on - he did some reviewing and she was a part-time translator - but they earnestly subscribed to the Bloomsbury creed, which valued personal relationships above ideological commitment and calculated that hedonism, in a world bereft of God, was the only rational response to existence. In 1940, Frances acclaimed her friend Molly MacCarthy as 'the arch-priestess of fun'; she and her intimates, who conscientiously objected to the war, did their best to ignore it, and played records of Monteverdi and Haydn while the bombs fell. </p> <p>Their preciosity concealed a dismaying defeatism.

'Conversations,' she reckoned, 'could take the place of events', a prescription for the kind of novel admired by Bloomsbury, and also a convenient formula for snubbing history. </p> <p>The conversations mostly happened at country houses, where Frances was, according to the catty Cecil Beaton, 'the most popular guest in England, who has to be booked weeks ahead'. Those houses were also the sacred sites of Bloomsbury fiction: Howard's End, Poyns Hall in Between the Acts, or the holiday home of the Ramseys in To the Lighthouse. The Partridges had their own talking shop in Wiltshire, and when Frances had to sell the house in 1961 after Ralph's death, a friend who'd taken part in blathering weekend marathons there described the place as 'a centre of loving hospitality and enlightenment and the greatest civilised taste in all things', as if it had been the Acropolis. </p> <p>No wonder that Frances, visiting Athens, saw the haughty sculptured temple maidens of the Erectheion as 'a row of Vanessa Bells'. </p> <p>The people graded one another like examiners in Oxford Finals. Visiting Duncan Grant at Charleston, Frances validates 'the first-rateness of this Bloomsbury world'. The angelic temper of Sebastian Sprott places him 'in the first class', though a 'curious lack of soaring power in his mental processes' demotes him to an upper second. Such decisions were not left to the drearily professional dons. </p> <p>When Frances's son, Burgo, frets about his Oxford entrance exam, a family friend encouragingly remarks: 'Oh, I know people who've got into Christ Church who could hardly put a cross against their name.' </p> <p>The seminars about ultimate value could only proceed if slavish drudges took care of the cooking and cleaning. In 1944, Frances warns Ralph: 'If you want me to remain a human being you must find me a \"help\".' A nameless skivvy appears a week later, identified only by her cheap dentures. 'What joy, what comfort!' coos Frances, and returns to argufying. </p> <p>Her friend Julia Strachey volunteers to do some washing-up as if it were war work, and Frances calls her concession 'heroic'. The highly-strung Julia wants to be evacuated from London during the Blitz, but rehousing her proves difficult. 'I can't bear,' she shrills, 'to stay in any rooms that aren't Georgian.' </p> <p>This doomed class did not survive the war which it so elegantly sat out. In 1945, Frances woke up to 'the horror of servantlessness', then to the realisation that she inhabited a mass society with scant regard for the self-cultivating individual. No one now reads Henry James (who was a friend of Frances's parents); instead, 'the common man', as she calls him, watches what she disdainfully refers to as 'the telly'. To her credit, she challenges the reactionary ire of a crony such as Lord Edward Sackville-West who, fulminating against the Angry Young Men, announces: 'I hate equality.' </p> <p>David Cecil exposes the mindlessness of his highbrow pretensions when he denounces the idea of the intellectual - which stinks, he says, of redbrick universities - and proudly prefers to call himself a dilettante. </p> <p>The new culture at least enabled Julia to avoid banal domestic chores: in 1961 she serves Frances 'a frozen Woolworth meal out of foil dishes [no washing-up]'. When Ralph goes into hospital, Frances confronts the 'great emporia' where 'mind, feelings and thoughts are buried under a mass of tubes and switches'. Yet on a trip to Leningrad, she acknowledges that uniformity is 'the price that must be paid for fair shares'. A wrenching deconversion occurs at Covent Garden in 1971, when a titled crone objects that: 'They won't let one leave one's glass on the edge of the box!' She is unimpressed when Frances suggests that this might be a hazard for people sitting below: 'The stalls, I see, are the lower classes!' The opera that night is Le Nozze di Figaro, which rehearses the revolution. </p> <p>The talkathon winds down, as Frances recognises that conversations are ephemeral sandcastles. At last she is unceremoniously shushed: during the summer of 1964, she's rebuked by a nun at Assisi for loudly prating about the frescoes, then 'ticked off for talking too much by a fanatical pipe-smoking addict' on Centre Court at Wimbledon.

Your father.' </p> <p>Ken Wiwa was in London trying to ignore his father. Ignoring his father had become Junior's life's work. He had even legally changed his name from Ken Saro-Wiwa to Ken Wiwa, an attempt to shunt off a destiny he felt was his rightful, but unwanted, inheritance: 'Every time I stood before him, I saw the man I was supposed to become.' </p> <p>In 1994, Saro-Wiwa was accused of the murders of four Ogoni chiefs, among them his own wife's brother. Saro-Wiwa had no hand in the killings but the dictator Sani Abacha wasn't going to be inconvenienced by mere facts, not when Saro-Wiwa's Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People was encouraging the minority group to demand their rights. Worse, Saro-Wiwa, an environmentalist, was upsetting the mighty Shell oil company. He had to be silenced. </p> <p>The logical progression was for Ken Wiwa to continue his father's struggle. Which is why, in the autumn of 1994, Ken Wiwa was ignoring his father. It was the moment the 26-year-old had spent his life trying to avoid. A series of passionate letters travelled between father and son until a turning point was reached. Ken Wiwa quit his job and over the next year dedicated himself to saving his father, lobbying politicians and heads of state to intervene, writing articles, giving interviews. General Abacha was unmoved. On 10 November 1995, Ken Saro-Wiwa was hanged and his body destroyed by acid. </p> <p>It had all the ingredients of a Shakespearean drama: Ken Saro-Wiwa was dead and his son was primed to avenge his death. 'But like Hamlet, I hesitated and left the stage altogether pleading political naivety and the need for time and space to deal with losing my father.' Hence this book, an attempt 'to set the record straight and about Ken Saro-Wiwa, to expose his critics and accuse his killers'. </p> <p>Wiwa junior's earliest memories are of a colonial mansion in Nigeria 'surrounded by a sea of gardens' full of magnolia, orange, mango and palm trees. It was a home with music, servants, lavish parties, a beautiful mother and a fun father. Until Saro-Wiwa was fired from his government job. Then everything changed. Junior and his siblings were catapulted into the post-lapsarian world of an English boarding school. The only Africans in their school, the 'Wee-Wee' brothers had to fit in, at a cost to their Nigerian identity. </p> <p>Their father 'expected we would all return to Nigeria and apply the expensive education to solving Nigeria's problems'. But relations between father and son frayed. Ken Wiwa felt increasingly isolated from Africa, which had become one with his distant, activist father. He preferred, in Saro-Wiwa's words, to loiter 'around the fringes of British society'. </p> <p>Ken Wiwa does not spare himself in this story. He reveals self-truths he is not proud of. You feel for him. You feel for his father. His elegantly written book is a weave of Nigerian and family history, both turbulent, both tragic, neither without hope. The book is also a song of the Ogoni people, a tribute to their struggle, their endurance. It is, moreover, a story of being trapped in history; the children of heroes find their lives shaped by their parents, as Wiwa discovers when he meets Nkosinathi Biko, son of Steve Biko, Zindzi Mandela, and Aung San Suu Kyi. </p> <p>Suu Kyi's parting words are: 'Best of luck in everything you do, Ken, because you know, we are one family in all of this.' </p> <p>By the end of this poignant book, Ken Wiwa has returned to Nigeria for his father's funeral. It was a symbolic ceremony because Saro-Wiwa's remains have still not been returned to the family. Ken Wiwa's return was greeted by crowds of ecstatic Ogoni 'who had come to witness the reincarnation of Ken-Saro Wiwa'. Writing this book has led Ken Wiwa to accept his place in Africa's history - it is in his blood, in his face, in his name. There is still so much to do. 'So where does Ken Saro-Wiwa end and Ken Wiwa begin? I don't know. I have no idea where he ends, but I'm learning to accept and realise that I am my father's son.'</p>",

Year on year for three decades, Elmore Leonard has produced crime novels that, with few exceptions, have set the bench mark for other US writers. But while in the second half of the Nineties the triple whammy of the movie versions of Get Shorty, Jackie Brown and Out of Sight established his wider popularity - and his credentials as the hippest writer around - he seemed to be losing his way. </p> <p> Cuba Libre (1998) was a not entirely successful quasi-return to the decidedly un-hip western stories that first established his reputation in the Fifties. A collection of those very stories came out the following year alongside his first sequel, Be Cool, the further adventures of Get Shorty's Chili Palmer. The novel had his trademark tight plotting, colourful characters and tough-funny dialogue but the elderly Leonard set it, unwisely, in the youth music business. There were, in consequence, some embarrassing passages. </p> <p>Pagan Babies is, in some ways, his most ambitious novel yet. I can't think of (m)any authors who would have the confidence to set a crime story involving a clever but heartless con against the background of the Rwandan genocide - and then make it succeed both as a comedy and a love story of sorts. The central character, Father Terry Dunn, is an unlikely priest. With a background in cigarette smuggling and tax evasion, he starts the novel in the Rwandan war zone with a church converted to a tomb for 47 unburied, mutilated victims of a Hutu massacre. His idea of penance for some of the murderers necessitates a swift return to Detroit where he sets out to raise money for orphaned children (his pagan babies). </p> <p>A meeting with wannabe stand-up comic Debbie Dewey gets him involved in her attempts to get back at a low-life who cheated her out of $67,000. The resulting scam involves hustling the mob, encounters with an exceedingly stupid hitman and a mordant story of con and counter-con, double-cross and triple-cross. </p> <p>There are few superlatives left unused to describe Leonard's writing but Pagan Babies warrants superlatives for the way the fast-paced narrative is both moving and highly amusing. Remarkable. </p> <p>Lawrence Block is another of American crime writing's multi-award winning old pros, with almost 50 novels and six collections of short stories to his credit. He already has three series characters - PI Matthew Scudder, bookshop owner-cum-burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr and spy Evan Tanner - but now there's a fourth, hitman John Keller. Keller had an engaging outing in last year's Hit Man, which was both an episodic novel and a collection of short stories. He returns in <strong> Hit List</strong>, a more traditional mystery novel in which he is appalled to discover that he is somebody else's target. </p> <p>Keller is a likeable creation. Although you might think that Pulp Fiction and Grosse Point Blank had taken the notion of quirkily attractive hitmen as far as it can go, Block takes a different line with his character. There's nothing cool about Keller, even though in this novel he has an affair with a SoHo artist. He looks like a corporate man, always wears suits and ties and does his work to pay for the cost of his hobby - stamp collecting. He even does jury service.</p> <p>Block's casual, meandering approach to telling his story may jar or entertain, according to taste. There's a lot of off-the-narrative-point chat between Keller and his 'broker', Dot. Sometimes their chat and Keller's ruminations about the big and small things in life are hilarious; sometimes they are wearisome - Keller is no Socrates Fortlow, Walter Mosley's philosophising ex-con. An enjoyable read, nevertheless. </p> <p>British writer Robert Goddard's novels are not easy to categorise. His 12 contemporary and historical bestsellers - which include Past Caring, Caught in the Light, Set in Stone and Into the Blue, which made a disappointing TV film several years ago - have been variously described as mysteries, crime novels, thrillers and even historical romances. What they have in common is a strong narrative thrust and ingenious plotting, elements which are robustly evident in <strong> Sea Change</strong>. </p> <p>This picaresque tale of high adventure and low intrigue takes place in 1721-22, just after the South Sea Bubble has burst. Goddard's novels almost always feature an ineffectual protagonist and William Spandrel, the impoverished mapmaker who is the central character here, is, by dint of circumstances, extremely ineffectual. </p> <p>Entrusted with the secret delivery to Amsterdam of a great MacGuffin - an account book whose contents implicate the highest in the land in the corruption surrounding the South Sea Company - he swaps debtors prison in London for the threat of the hangman's noose in Holland. Thereafter, in an effort to clear himself, he embarks on a long, hazardous journey to the Jacobite court in Rome, where he gets embroiled in further intrigue. He is duped at every turn in every country he passes through by a wonderful cast of crooks, charlatans and real historical characters such as Robert Walpole, the future Chancellor of the Exchequer. </p> <p>In Sea Change, the historical period is vividly conjured up and the narrative flows effortlessly. There is more adventure and less mystery in this than in some of Goddard's other books, but the result is engrossing, storytelling of a very high order. </p> <p>Another week, another much loved fictional police detective bites the dust. H.R.F. Keating's latest Inspector Ghote novel, <strong> Breaking and Entering</strong>, will be the last. The Bombay police inspector first made his appearance a startling 36 years ago in the Gold Dagger-winning The Perfect Murder, published in 1964. And to bring the series happily full circle, the new novel reunites Ghote with Axel Svensson, the Swedish friend who helped him solve that perfect murder so many years ago. </p> <p>This time, the duo are trying to solve the murder of a wealthy businessman in a tightly secure mansion at the same time as they are tracking down an ingenious cat-burglar who has been stealing jewellery from high-rise apartment blocks. Although it's the last in the series - Keating has already embarked on a new non-Indian series - there's nothing elegiac about the novel. Indeed, it's as fresh, lively and entertaining as the first - a delight.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt. Volume III: From Major to Blair</strong><br>edited by Sarah Curtis<br>Macmillan \u00a325, pp750<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502088996,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>It is unkind to focus on a simple slip-up, especially one that has been apologised for in advance. And it would be unfair to suggest that all Woodrow Wyatt's reminiscences in this third volume of posthumous journals are subject to similar vagaries. But when the aged Voice of Reason enthuses about a reunion with Bianca Jagger in such excitable terms, it is bound to attract attention. </p> <p>'She is an amazing girl,' he writes on 18 June 1992. 'Full of sexual vitality which pours out at you. At one point she grasped my wrist and arm and got her sexuality on me. She was looking at me hard with her eyes. She must be like an octopus to go to bed with, wrapping her legs all around you.' </p> <p>Disconcerting to learn, then, that the late Lord Wyatt of Weeford was actually talking to someone else that night. A note ruefully inserted by the publishers reads: 'WW refers to a meeting with Bianca Jagger which we now learn did not in fact take place. He mistook someone else for her. We apologise to Ms Jagger for any embarrassment caused.' </p> <p>Whoever it was that captivated Wyatt she is not the only younger woman to win his approval in this volume. The boss's daughter, Liz Murdoch, gets the same treatment. She 'is highly sexed', we learn gratuitously after one encounter. </p> <p>Unfortunately, it is a bit too obvious what Wyatt is trying to do. He must be a lecher, he thinks, if his personality is ever to leap off the page. In fact, the only bit of lasciviousness that really works in this journal is a silly passing reference to the bottom of the tennis star, Martina Hingis. It is an Alan Clark-like, inappropriate sort of lusting which is amusingly underlined by the inclusion of a completely irrelevant photograph of Hingis and her cherished cheeks, along with all the snaps of the Wyatt family, for whom the book's profits are intended. </p> <p>Wyatt is deliberately trying to paint himself as a rogue, probably because he suspects it is the only way to commercial success. He clearly doesn't mind the idea that his daughter, the journalist Petronella, might one day put pen to paper about him. 'I said I didn't mind her making a fortune out of turning me into a comic figure,' he recalls, when he first uncovered plans for her recent memoir, Father, Dear Father. </p> <p>The author knows that he must also mix in a high quotient of vitriol. He is really teed off, for instance, when Robin Day turns up on a holiday and begins to hold court. There is particular pleasure taken too, in exposing the less generous sides of those public figures who have otherwise specialised in appearing sweet-natured. Wyatt has John Major slagging off John Prescott as a 'hypocrite', who is 'ignored by the rest of the Cabinet'. The Queen Mum, in turn, is quoted as judging John Major to be 'weak'. </p> <p>Such betrayals of confidence are, of course, the stock-in-trade of the diarist, but in Wyatt's case the technique doesn't sit well with his much-trumpeted belief in the need for privacy laws. Several times he went against his editorial masters at the News of the World on this issue. </p> <p>All private diarists are entitled to be inconsistent egotists, but when you decide to go into print you have a duty at least to entertain and there are three problems with Wyatt's attempts to do this. First, because he was a journalist, unlike Alan Clark, all his best stories were delivered up to the public at the time. Second, Wyatt is not prepared to be revealing enough about the areas of his life which were truly odd.

      "bodyText": "The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt. Volume III: From Major to Blair edited by Sarah Curtis Macmillan \u00a325, pp750 Buy it at BOL It is unkind to focus on a simple slip-up, especially one that has been apologised for in advance. And it would be unfair to suggest that all Woodrow Wyatt's reminiscences in this third volume of posthumous journals are subject to similar vagaries. But when the aged Voice of Reason enthuses about a reunion with Bianca Jagger in such excitable terms, it is bound to attract attention. 'She is an amazing girl,' he writes on 18 June 1992. 'Full of sexual vitality which pours out at you. At one point she grasped my wrist and arm and got her sexuality on me. She was looking at me hard with her eyes. She must be like an octopus to go to bed with, wrapping her legs all around you.' Disconcerting to learn, then, that the late Lord Wyatt of Weeford was actually talking to someone else that night. A note ruefully inserted by the publishers reads: 'WW refers to a meeting with Bianca Jagger which we now learn did not in fact take place. He mistook someone else for her. We apologise to Ms Jagger for any embarrassment caused.' Whoever it was that captivated Wyatt she is not the only younger woman to win his approval in this volume. The boss's daughter, Liz Murdoch, gets the same treatment. She 'is highly sexed', we learn gratuitously after one encounter. Unfortunately, it is a bit too obvious what Wyatt is trying to do. He must be a lecher, he thinks, if his personality is ever to leap off the page. In fact, the only bit of lasciviousness that really works in this journal is a silly passing reference to the bottom of the tennis star, Martina Hingis. It is an Alan Clark-like, inappropriate sort of lusting which is amusingly underlined by the inclusion of a completely irrelevant photograph of Hingis and her cherished cheeks, along with all the snaps of the Wyatt family, for whom the book's profits are intended. Wyatt is deliberately trying to paint himself as a rogue, probably because he suspects it is the only way to commercial success. He clearly doesn't mind the idea that his daughter, the journalist Petronella, might one day put pen to paper about him. 'I said I didn't mind her making a fortune out of turning me into a comic figure,' he recalls, when he first uncovered plans for her recent memoir, Father, Dear Father. The author knows that he must also mix in a high quotient of vitriol. He is really teed off, for instance, when Robin Day turns up on a holiday and begins to hold court. There is particular pleasure taken too, in exposing the less generous sides of those public figures who have otherwise specialised in appearing sweet-natured. Wyatt has John Major slagging off John Prescott as a 'hypocrite', who is 'ignored by the rest of the Cabinet'. The Queen Mum, in turn, is quoted as judging John Major to be 'weak'. Such betrayals of confidence are, of course, the stock-in-trade of the diarist, but in Wyatt's case the technique doesn't sit well with his much-trumpeted belief in the need for privacy laws. Several times he went against his editorial masters at the News of the World on this issue. All private diarists are entitled to be inconsistent egotists, but when you decide to go into print you have a duty at least to entertain and there are three problems with Wyatt's attempts to do this. First, because he was a journalist, unlike Alan Clark, all his best stories were delivered up to the public at the time. Second, Wyatt is not prepared to be revealing enough about the areas of his life which were truly odd. Third, his writing lacks Clark's imaginative phrasing. There are tantalising hints, however, of the faux-aristo domestic set-up with Lady Verushka (who fellow Hungarians still remember as 'Vera from Golders Green') and the winsome Petronella, known to her father as 'the St John's Wood nightingale'.",

That ground may be literature but, for Byatt, that is only one of many areas to be investigated; there are few writers with such a profound understanding of science, of botany, of painting, and if she has been able to use these in her work, it is because she is prepared to see them not just in terms of literary usefulness, but on their own terms. </p> <p>And a reader so widely curious and interested is always going to be interested in the new.

The Summer of Love, as I recall. Reading Tom Wolfe's The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby (1965) on my knees under a desk while I was failing to pay attention to what the Northern Universities Joint Matriculation thought was good for me, I discovered a slick and sassy world which seemed to offer opportunities unknowable at home. It was truly a means of escape. </p> <p>I didn't then know that it was called The New Journalism, but I was utterly jazzed by the neologisms, street smarts, sharp suits, seductive, high-octane, volatile Americana, sesquipedalian sentences and irreverent ideas. I was in awe of Wolfe's ability to combine microscopically acute visual observation together with a fine ear and an unknowable alchemy of getting the right words in the right cadences and proportions within a sentence to express something that has often been thought, but never said anything like as well. </p> <p>This New Journalism was also the province of Gay Talese and Hunter S. Thompson. Talese was a Manhattan boulevardier of whom you hear little nowadays, perhaps on account of his name. Thompson was and remains a freak in thrall to intoxicants, hypnotics, stimulants, narcotics and a dangerously schismatic perspective on the American Dream. </p> <p>His own description of New Journalism remains the best: 'Holy shit, if I can write like this and get away with it, why should I keep trying to write like the New York Times ? It was like falling down an elevator shaft and landing in a pool of mermaids.' </p> <p>Wolfe was the same, but different. He was always a man apart. Sure, he had become a suave New York partygoer, but was in essence an old-fashioned Southern gent: a conservative moralist in a white suit. There's no reason to doubt Wolfe's own explanation. A PhD from Yale had not fully prepared him for his first journalistic assignment, reporting on drag racing from a strip in California. He made his notes, but could not finish the story. In despair as the deadline loomed, he typed up his scribbles and connected the jottings with what sub-editors call leader dots. Nathalie Sarraute more beautifully called them points de suspension. Whatever - a new and intoxicating style of writing was born. </p> <p>Wolfe's journalism reached its peak in 1979 with his spell-binding account of the US space programme: The Right Stuff was a classic blend of meticulous observation, frontier heroics and brilliantly assimulated techno-jargon. It was probably his best book, although The Bonfire of the Vanities in 1987 is the one that made him an international celebrity.</p> <p>Now the journalist had turned novelist, although both critics and admirers accept that Bonfire's strengths were more in reportage than in imagination. Its success riled the US literary establishment and for this hubris he received a drubbing. Maureen Dowd said in the Sunday New York Times that in Bonfire Wolfe 'had a hard time getting in front of his satire. He couldn't mock the masters of the universe as fast as they could make mockeries of themselves'. </p> <p>I'm not so sure: Bonfire is one of the great books of the second half of the twentieth century, but maybe she had a point. Hooking Up is Wolfe's latest collection of journalism, which includes 'My Three Stooges' - his revisionist attack on Norman Mailer, John Updike and John Irving and, indeed, American literature as a whole. Other material, originally published in the American Spectator, Forbes and Harper's, and the story 'Ambush at Fort Bragg', a sort of warm-up loop for his ultimately disappointing 1998 social realist shelf-buster, A Man in Full, also appears here. The title essay is an account of millennial America with too many references to oral sex. </p> <p>There is no living writer I admire more than Wolfe, so it makes me sad that this collection has a feeling of staleness. Wolfe once gave us unforgettable expressions which defined whole periods and sensibilities. Not just 'the Right Stuff', but also 'Radical Chic' and 'The Me Decade'. Here 'Rococo Marxists' is not so good. It won't catch on. The energy and invention are missing. </p> <p>Wolfe's passion is the United States during what he memorably called its Bourbon Louis Romp and its 'lurid carnival'. He writes best about what he loves and understands. Historically, while always sharp and entertaining, his least satisfactory books have been his art criticism, The Painted Word (1975) and From Bauhaus to Our House (1981). </p> <p>In these he allowed the cross curmudgeon to get the upper hand over the brilliantly dandified social observer. Hooking Up has the same feel. Wolfe should, for instance, have been the truest chronicler of Silicon Valley, the new frontier that dominates contemporary life and business in the United States. Instead, it has been left to far, far less talented writers including Michael Wolff (Burn Rate), Kurt Andersen (The Turn of the Century) and Michael Lewis (The New New Thing) to describe the electronic landgrab. Wolfe writes about it here, in 'Two Young Men Who Went West', his account of Intel. It is a good read, but way below his best in terms of style, humour and energy. </p> <p>America, Maureen Dowd said, is now so wacko that 'satire... [is]... simply redundant'. If true, bad news for America's greatest satirist.</p>",

I was in awe of Wolfe's ability to combine microscopically acute visual observation together with a fine ear and an unknowable alchemy of getting the right words in the right cadences and proportions within a sentence to express something that has often been thought, but never said anything like as well. This New Journalism was also the province of Gay Talese and Hunter S. Thompson. Talese was a Manhattan boulevardier of whom you hear little nowadays, perhaps on account of his name. Thompson was and remains a freak in thrall to intoxicants, hypnotics, stimulants, narcotics and a dangerously schismatic perspective on the American Dream. His own description of New Journalism remains the best: 'Holy shit, if I can write like this and get away with it, why should I keep trying to write like the New York Times ? It was like falling down an elevator shaft and landing in a pool of mermaids.' Wolfe was the same, but different. He was always a man apart. Sure, he had become a suave New York partygoer, but was in essence an old-fashioned Southern gent: a conservative moralist in a white suit. There's no reason to doubt Wolfe's own explanation. A PhD from Yale had not fully prepared him for his first journalistic assignment, reporting on drag racing from a strip in California. He made his notes, but could not finish the story. In despair as the deadline loomed, he typed up his scribbles and connected the jottings with what sub-editors call leader dots. Nathalie Sarraute more beautifully called them points de suspension. Whatever - a new and intoxicating style of writing was born. Wolfe's journalism reached its peak in 1979 with his spell-binding account of the US space programme: The Right Stuff was a classic blend of meticulous observation, frontier heroics and brilliantly assimulated techno-jargon. It was probably his best book, although The Bonfire of the Vanities in 1987 is the one that made him an international celebrity. Now the journalist had turned novelist, although both critics and admirers accept that Bonfire's strengths were more in reportage than in imagination. Its success riled the US literary establishment and for this hubris he received a drubbing. Maureen Dowd said in the Sunday New York Times that in Bonfire Wolfe 'had a hard time getting in front of his satire. He couldn't mock the masters of the universe as fast as they could make mockeries of themselves'. I'm not so sure: Bonfire is one of the great books of the second half of the twentieth century, but maybe she had a point. Hooking Up is Wolfe's latest collection of journalism, which includes 'My Three Stooges' - his revisionist attack on Norman Mailer, John Updike and John Irving and, indeed, American literature as a whole. Other material, originally published in the American Spectator, Forbes and Harper's, and the story 'Ambush at Fort Bragg', a sort of warm-up loop for his ultimately disappointing 1998 social realist shelf-buster, A Man in Full, also appears here. The title essay is an account of millennial America with too many references to oral sex. There is no living writer I admire more than Wolfe, so it makes me sad that this collection has a feeling of staleness. Wolfe once gave us unforgettable expressions which defined whole periods and sensibilities. Not just 'the Right Stuff', but also 'Radical Chic' and 'The Me Decade'. Here 'Rococo Marxists' is not so good. It won't catch on. The energy and invention are missing. Wolfe's passion is the United States during what he memorably called its Bourbon Louis Romp and its 'lurid carnival'. He writes best about what he loves and understands. Historically, while always sharp and entertaining, his least satisfactory books have been his art criticism, The Painted Word (1975) and From Bauhaus to Our House (1981). In these he allowed the cross curmudgeon to get the upper hand over the brilliantly dandified social observer. Hooking Up has the same feel. Wolfe should, for instance, have been the truest chronicler of Silicon Valley, the new frontier that dominates contemporary life and business in the United States. Instead, it has been left to far, far less talented writers including Michael Wolff (Burn Rate), Kurt Andersen (The Turn of the Century) and Michael Lewis (The New New Thing) to describe the electronic landgrab. Wolfe writes about it here, in 'Two Young Men Who Went West', his account of Intel. It is a good read, but way below his best in terms of style, humour and energy. America, Maureen Dowd said, is now so wacko that 'satire... [is]... simply redundant'. If true, bad news for America's greatest satirist.",

Faced with the prospect of gays in the armed forces, traditionalists warned that discipline would be compromised and heterosexual heroes would be outraged.</p> <p>But 10 months after the ban on gay servicemen was lifted, the first assessment of the consequences has found that the effect on morale has been non-existent.</p> <p>A confidential Ministry of Defence Review, obtained by The Observer, states that the introduction of gays has had no adverse effects on the operational effectiveness of the forces. The startling conclusion will cause serious embarrassment to service chiefs, who fought to retain the ban, and to the Conservative Party, which has pledged to consider its reintroduction.</p> <p>MoD staff canvassed the Army, Navy and RAF in August, six months after the ban was lifted. 'The services reported that the revised policy on homosexuality had no discernible impact, either positive or negative, on recruitment,' says the report.</p> <p>'There is widespread acceptance of the new policy. It has not been an issue of great debate. In fact, there has been a marked lack of reaction. Generally there has been a mature, pragmatic approach which allowed the policy to succeed. The change in policy has been hailed as a solid achievement.'</p> <p>The ban, which led to up to 200 sackings a year, was lifted in January after the European Court of Human Rights ruled it unlawful.</p> <p>The court awarded \u00a3400,000 compensation to four military personnel who claimed that their dismissal was a breach of rights to privacy and family life. One, former navy Commander Duncan Lustig-Prean, was awarded \u00a3144,000. Hundreds of other cases await settlement.</p> <p>The MoD report has not been published in Britain, but a summary was sent inadvertently three weeks ago to a military policy researcher at the University of California. Aaron Belkin, assistant professor of politics at the university, said: 'Looking at the situation from overseas, it appears there was a full-scale rhetorical assault on gays in the military, prior to this ban being lifted.

      "bodyText": "It was supposed to lead to the collapse of Britain's military might. Faced with the prospect of gays in the armed forces, traditionalists warned that discipline would be compromised and heterosexual heroes would be outraged. But 10 months after the ban on gay servicemen was lifted, the first assessment of the consequences has found that the effect on morale has been non-existent. A confidential Ministry of Defence Review, obtained by The Observer, states that the introduction of gays has had no adverse effects on the operational effectiveness of the forces. The startling conclusion will cause serious embarrassment to service chiefs, who fought to retain the ban, and to the Conservative Party, which has pledged to consider its reintroduction. MoD staff canvassed the Army, Navy and RAF in August, six months after the ban was lifted. 'The services reported that the revised policy on homosexuality had no discernible impact, either positive or negative, on recruitment,' says the report. 'There is widespread acceptance of the new policy. It has not been an issue of great debate. In fact, there has been a marked lack of reaction. Generally there has been a mature, pragmatic approach which allowed the policy to succeed. The change in policy has been hailed as a solid achievement.' The ban, which led to up to 200 sackings a year, was lifted in January after the European Court of Human Rights ruled it unlawful. The court awarded \u00a3400,000 compensation to four military personnel who claimed that their dismissal was a breach of rights to privacy and family life. One, former navy Commander Duncan Lustig-Prean, was awarded \u00a3144,000. Hundreds of other cases await settlement. The MoD report has not been published in Britain, but a summary was sent inadvertently three weeks ago to a military policy researcher at the University of California. Aaron Belkin, assistant professor of politics at the university, said: 'Looking at the situation from overseas, it appears there was a full-scale rhetorical assault on gays in the military, prior to this ban being lifted. This report from the MoD appears to admit that the arguments put forward were absolutely and profoundly untrue.' An MoD spokesman insis-ted: 'We are pleased. Generally people have taken a pragmatic view of the change. We had one policy that was right until earlier this year. Now we have another.' Angela Mason, director of the campaign group Stonewall, which backed the European Court cases, said: 'This report shows that the worst fears of some politicians have come to nothing. 'Opposition to gay law reform, whether over section 28, the age of consent or military service, is repeatedly rooted in unrealistic fears of the consequences.' At Rank Outsiders, the gay service organisation, chairman Steve Johnston said: 'Most of those who objected strongly to this are old soldiers who were just unenlightened. It's society that is changing quite rapidly. 'We've had to deal with one or two minor complaints from gay personnel about their treatment this year, but they have been resolved swiftly. The MoD has asked us to go straight to them with any cases of bullying and have assured us that they will be dealt with at the highest levels.' Johnston, a former Military Police sergeant, said: 'Of the hundreds of people we are in touch with, some have chosen to say nothing. They still see the way in which former colleagues were traumatised by their treatment. 'The services are not just a job, they are a way of life, and some people had all that taken away from them for no reason.' The most senior officer re-admitted to active service since the ban was overturned is Michael Griffiths, a naval lieutenant-commander dismissed in 1994. One Wiltshire-based army brigadier re-signed last January, insisting that he was protesting at the removal of the ban. However, he agreed to continue serving until the end of 2001.

But this is no ordinary weekend - they are heading for Britain's first teen lifestyle 'exhibition'.</p> <p>Pop2000, which takes place in Birmingham this weekend, is Britain's biggest ever gathering of teenagers. It is big, hot and colourful, and provides an instant picture of twenty-first century youngsters. Thirty years ago, the festival would have been a mini-Woodstock of tie-dye fashion, fertility rights and naked dancing. The musicians would have sung of rebellion, alienation and changing the world.</p> <p>What do today's teenagers want? Hippy fashions have been replaced by logo-heavy T-shirts and the latest \u00a3100 'must have' Adidas shell trainers. Love is still in the air, but it is love of manicures, hair styling and Tommy Girl fragrances; shopping is the new snogging. The only drugs anyone wants are the ones that keep you slim, firm your bust, or build up your Robbie Williams-style pecs. And what about music - the outpouring of disaffected youth? S-Club 7 are on stage telling the assembled teens to 'reach for the top'.</p> <p>As their parents sit in the 'adults' cr\u00e8che' trying to remember the rebellious Sixties, their children are out there spending their money to prop up the system. Forget Generation X and Generation Y. Generation \u00a3 is selling itself and letting itself be bought.</p> <p>Big business has taken over Pop2000, turning Birmingham's NEC into more of a mall than a teenage fan club. 'It is the name that does it, definitely the name,' says Danielle, as she walks past the 'Diesel - for successful living' fashion stand. 'I love labels. If it doesn't have the label, I won't buy it. Labels are everything. It's about looking right, being part of something, of a group,' adds Ade.</p> <p>And a new label is on the way. One of the chief sponsors of Pop2000 is Popworld, a global music brand launched this autumn, which aims to rival the Disney empire.

      "bodyText": "Meet Ade, Danielle, Ryan and Lisa. They look like any other streetwise teenagers. It is 10am and they are heading off to meet their friends for a Saturday in town. But this is no ordinary weekend - they are heading for Britain's first teen lifestyle 'exhibition'. Pop2000, which takes place in Birmingham this weekend, is Britain's biggest ever gathering of teenagers. It is big, hot and colourful, and provides an instant picture of twenty-first century youngsters. Thirty years ago, the festival would have been a mini-Woodstock of tie-dye fashion, fertility rights and naked dancing. The musicians would have sung of rebellion, alienation and changing the world. What do today's teenagers want? Hippy fashions have been replaced by logo-heavy T-shirts and the latest \u00a3100 'must have' Adidas shell trainers. Love is still in the air, but it is love of manicures, hair styling and Tommy Girl fragrances; shopping is the new snogging. The only drugs anyone wants are the ones that keep you slim, firm your bust, or build up your Robbie Williams-style pecs. And what about music - the outpouring of disaffected youth? S-Club 7 are on stage telling the assembled teens to 'reach for the top'. As their parents sit in the 'adults' cr\u00e8che' trying to remember the rebellious Sixties, their children are out there spending their money to prop up the system. Forget Generation X and Generation Y. Generation \u00a3 is selling itself and letting itself be bought. Big business has taken over Pop2000, turning Birmingham's NEC into more of a mall than a teenage fan club. 'It is the name that does it, definitely the name,' says Danielle, as she walks past the 'Diesel - for successful living' fashion stand. 'I love labels. If it doesn't have the label, I won't buy it. Labels are everything. It's about looking right, being part of something, of a group,' adds Ade. And a new label is on the way. One of the chief sponsors of Pop2000 is Popworld, a global music brand launched this autumn, which aims to rival the Disney empire. Popworld, created by ex-Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller and marketing executive Robert Dodds, is already so successful the company has raised \u00a310m to set up a theme park. Around 50,000 teenagers log on to the patented Popworld website everyday for their fix of pop gossip. Dodds and Fuller, who now manages S-Club 7, are aiming directly at the untutored appetites of the young. In the first of many potential deals, they have signed up Cadbury's to produce 'Bumper Bags' of 'Pop chocolates'. Britain's biggest firms have spent more than \u00a31m at Pop2000 ensuring teenagers can dress in Moschino, dance with Pepsi, get a makeover with Select models, sign their first junior credit card and call home on a free One-2-One mobile. Far from rebelling against corporate success, youngsters cannot get enough of it. Those who know them say teens cleave to these consumer icons as badges of identification. 'Young teens do not use politics, religion or class to express themselves; they speak a new language - consumerism,' says Sean Pillot de Chenecey, a marketing consultant who has worked for Levi's, PlayStation, and Coca-Cola. 'They understand that products have personality and they use those products to help them see their own identity and to communicate that identity to their peers.' Forget Reclaim the Streets, Prague, Seattle and the 'No Logo' rebellion, today's teens are growing older younger and getting on with the all-consuming business of consuming. How did we get here? The rise of Generation \u00a3 lies in greater affluence. Parents - often divorced - are wealthier than ever and lavish more money on their kids. Datamonitor, the market research company, says teenagers have a staggering \u00a38.4bn worth of annual disposable income. But is Pop2000 just a blip - the kind of event that always attracts savvy, young, fashion-conscious consumers? Not so, says NOP Family, which is conducting a poll of the youth market for The Observer. The survey shows that for 14 to 16-year-olds friends are twice as important as family. Four out of five rate 'having a good time' and music as 'most important to me'. Designer clothes are more important than the environment, and making money rates higher than helping others. Barbie Clarke, head of NOP Family, says: 'Politics is meaningless but independence and making money are real and attainable goals.'

With their trademark three stripes, Adidas clothes cost a small fortune to buy and are promoted by world-famous names such as England skipper David Beckham, Olympic heptathlete Denise Lewis and Russian tennis player Anna Kournikova.</p> <p>But the company will this week become embroiled in controversy when the European Parliament hears of the barbaric treatment of employees in Indonesian sweatshop factories supplying the German conglomerate.</p> <p>The Parliament will be told that clothes for Adidas were made in two factories using child labour, forced overtime and sexual harassment. Representatives of workers in two Indonesian factories supplying the German company,will tell Euro MPs that in the Nikomax Gemilang and Tuntex factories, in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, children as young as 15 were:</p> <p>\u0095 made to work 15-hour days;</p> <p>\u0095 expected to do at least 70 hours a week and punished for refusing to do overtime;</p> <p>\u0095 paid less than $60 a month, rates below the International Labour Organisation's demand for a living wage;</p> <p>\u0095 penalised for taking leave during medical difficulties and had illegal deductions taken from wages as punishments for minor misdemeanours.</p> <p>Sports goods companies have been criticised for exploiting workers in the developing world before. There was a storm just before the 1998 World Cup, after footballs bearing the Manchester United club crest were being made by child labourers in India, working for as little as 6p an hour. Cricket ball manufacturers were also criticised.</p> <p>A report by Christian Aid revealed that children, some as young as seven, were regularly used in the production of a wide range of sports goods in India. Most of the \u00a313m worth of goods went to Britain.</p> <p>Last year a worker from a Bangkok factory for Adidas claimed that for less than \u00a31 per day she worked 12-hour shifts seven days a week, producing sportswear, shoes and replica kits for the company.</p> <p>She claimed conditions were poor in the Thai factory and the management acted brutally to meet large orders within a limited time, often denying workers statutory rights such as holidays and sick pay. The accusations are similar to those made by the Indonesian workers.</p> <p>The woman was eventually sacked in 1998 along with 23 others after they formed a union in an attempt to win more rights.

      "bodyText": "They are the ultimate status symbols for sports stars and street-conscious young people. With their trademark three stripes, Adidas clothes cost a small fortune to buy and are promoted by world-famous names such as England skipper David Beckham, Olympic heptathlete Denise Lewis and Russian tennis player Anna Kournikova. But the company will this week become embroiled in controversy when the European Parliament hears of the barbaric treatment of employees in Indonesian sweatshop factories supplying the German conglomerate. The Parliament will be told that clothes for Adidas were made in two factories using child labour, forced overtime and sexual harassment. Representatives of workers in two Indonesian factories supplying the German company,will tell Euro MPs that in the Nikomax Gemilang and Tuntex factories, in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, children as young as 15 were: \u0095 made to work 15-hour days; \u0095 expected to do at least 70 hours a week and punished for refusing to do overtime; \u0095 paid less than $60 a month, rates below the International Labour Organisation's demand for a living wage; \u0095 penalised for taking leave during medical difficulties and had illegal deductions taken from wages as punishments for minor misdemeanours. Sports goods companies have been criticised for exploiting workers in the developing world before. There was a storm just before the 1998 World Cup, after footballs bearing the Manchester United club crest were being made by child labourers in India, working for as little as 6p an hour. Cricket ball manufacturers were also criticised. A report by Christian Aid revealed that children, some as young as seven, were regularly used in the production of a wide range of sports goods in India. Most of the \u00a313m worth of goods went to Britain. Last year a worker from a Bangkok factory for Adidas claimed that for less than \u00a31 per day she worked 12-hour shifts seven days a week, producing sportswear, shoes and replica kits for the company. She claimed conditions were poor in the Thai factory and the management acted brutally to meet large orders within a limited time, often denying workers statutory rights such as holidays and sick pay. The accusations are similar to those made by the Indonesian workers. The woman was eventually sacked in 1998 along with 23 others after they formed a union in an attempt to win more rights. The factory management claimed she was a disruptive influence. Most Adidas goods are produced in Third World countries, particularly Asia, with orders awarded to locally run factories. Many orders are sub-contracted at local level, leading to claims that the companies have little idea of where and how their goods are produced. Adidas denies ignoring workers' rights for the sake of profit, claiming they have strict labour codes and constantly monitoring wage levels and conditions to ensure a good working environment. Adidas spokesman Peter Csanadi countered the allegations earlier this year: 'We have factories where the conditions are very good and we take this whole issue very seriously,' he said. 'We know we have had problems, and we had to terminate some contracts because we saw that the management were not interested in good working conditions. 'We work closely with factory management and demand that they ensure good conditions for workers. We also have a team of our own people who go to factories to sort out problems.' Adidas, whose football shirts sell in a British high street store for more than \u00a350, have admitted problems at the two Indonesian factories and have recently increased pay and taken steps to ease overtime demands. Copies of the labourers' identity cards are now held at the Nikomas factory to ensure that no under-18s work there. The company admitted that at the Tuntex plant quotas were set too high. Workers complained of being fined for coming to work five minutes late. Adidas confirmed that women who took leave when menstruating, as legally entitled, lost an attendance bonus of 6,000 Rupiah (50p) and that a manager had been sacked for sexual harassment. Pay at the Nikomas plant was increased to more than 9,000 Rs (75p per day) following the campaigners complaints, Adidas said. The campaigners hope that the publicity surrounding the hearings next week will force states to become involved in the regulatory process. Ingborg Wick, who oversaw much of the research, said yesterday that government involvement was crucial. 'There has to be some overview of voluntary codes that companies sign with campaigners. There also needs to be an institutional framework and legal monitoring to ensure social standards in Third World production,' she said. The hearings - by the European Parliament's Development Committee - have been organised by Richard Howitt, the British MEP. jason.burke@observer.co.uk",

The controversial practice is being carried out in an attempt to continue the genetic family line if the man in the relationship is infertile. Senior medical figures confirmed that the practice, though unusual, was now regularly performed in British clinics. One described it as 'logical, appropriate and ethical'. But the procedure - which makes a father's son his biological half-brother and a child's biological father his or her grandfather - has fuelled the increasingly acrimonious debate over artificial insemination. Two recent studies by psychologists claimed that children born through anonymous sperm donation faced life-long emotional problems with personal identity, confusion and family mistrust. As a result of the disquiet, as The Observer revealed last year, sperm donors could be named under new proposals being considered by the government. Children fathered by donor insemination (DI) may be given the same right to trace their genetic fathers as adopted children are.

The practice is increasingly common overseas, particularly in Japan where the maintenance of blood lines is very important, and in America. In both countries it has sparked a fierce debate. The main proponent of the technique in Japan was recently called before a special ethics committee for violating the rules ensuring the anonymity of any donor. In America, lawyers have expressed concern about 'an emotional risk' if a known donor is in the family.",

      "body": "<p>It's far too measured, and far too refined, to qualify as a backlash. It's been going from strength to quiet strength for about 10 years now. It's still largely an American-dominated, \u00e9litist thing. Its leading campaigners have not yet reached household name status, but that won't be long now. The steady stream of deadly-serious-but-accessible expos\u00e9s against the Divorce Culture is beginning to yield results both here and in the US.</p> <p>The story as they tell it goes something like this. Over the past 35 years we have gone from thinking about divorce as a shame, a stigma and a minority option, to seeing it as an everyday event and every married person's right. We have convinced ourselves that it is at worst a minor disruption, even for the children, and that, even if they're upset and distressed for a while, they generally bounce back as fast as their newly liberated parents.</p> <p>Not so, say the concerned communitarians at the increasingly influential Institute for American Values. Set up in New York a decade ago by a group of intellectuals and academics, the institute has a manifesto called the Marriage Movement. Its stated aim is to put an end to the 'divorce revolution'. The doubling of the divorce rate and the five-fold increase in the number of babies born out of wedlock have, to quote founder member David Popenoe, 'created tragic hardships for children, created poverty within families, and burdened us with insupportable social costs'. And for what? he asks. It is abundantly clear that 'no one seems to be happier'.</p> <p>The way forward, he says, is to draw the divorcing nations of the West into an ongoing public debate about divorce. His theory is that a society aware of the 'truth' about divorce might turn against it in the same way that America has turned, so slowly but so surely, against smoking. Many feel it's best to accentuate the positive, as Linda J. Waite and Maggie Gallagher do in their new book, just out in the US: The Case for Marriage: Why Married People are Happier, Healthier, and Better Off Financially. Others think that advertising marriage is not enough: it also needs to be modernised. Popenoe suggested recently that we might 'rewrite the cultural script' for marriage by persuading new mothers to become child-centred stay-at-home dependants - but only for 20 years or so. Before and after this tiny blip, it was fine by him if they wanted to be fully-fledged members of the workforce.</p> <p>Popenoe's rhetoric has not made much of a dent in the divorce statistics. But it's made quite an impression in the upper echelons of New Labour. Look at the pro-marriage manual the Government plans to launch in the New Year. It is not likely to be the last word. Inside and outside the public sector, there is growing anger about the Government's apparent desire to privilege marriage and stigmatise divorce, and a growing chorus demanding that post-divorce families get the support they deserve.</p> <p>A powerful and persuasive new book just out in the US called The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce will not help their case. Its primary author, Judith Wallerstein, could be said to be the founding mother of the Marriage Movement: many members cite her earlier bestseller, Second Chances: Men, Women and Children a Decade after Divorce, as the book that converted them to the cause. Decades later, she still puts most of the rest of them to shame. In her new book, based on a longitudinal study she began in Marin County, California in 1971, she says she can now prove beyond doubtthat even conscientious divorcing parents harm their children, not just during the transitional stage, but for life.</p> <p>To illustrate her point, she pairs divorce survivors from the original study with contemporaries who grew up in the same communities, in families that remained 'intact' despite similar levels of conflict. The differences, she says, are stark. The children from broken families have a much harder time trusting the people they fall in love with. Unlike their almost-like peers who grew up in 'intact' marriages, they say they haven't the faintest idea what marriage really means: it is, as one subject puts it, like being asked to do a dance without ever having seen anyone else dance it.</p> <p>When parents and their children are living together under one roof, she says, the bond between the parents strengthens the bonds between parents and children. Even parents who argue incessantly can usually cooperate in the running of the household. All this changes when the family stretches itself to two households. The income that was sufficient for one unit cannot cover two. Spouses who were dependants are suddenly forced into full-time jobs. At the same time, they are entering into new relationships that do not always go so well. So they are less available, less able to keep the old routines going, and more likely to lean on their children for emotional support. This radically alters everyday experience for their children, as does the travelling back and forth between two homes.</p> <p>Things are made worse, Wallerstein says, by the fact that courts impose rigid care orders that fail to take into account the ways children's needs change as they grow older, and that treat children like so many packages to be shunted between depots. Children suffer most if the depots are more like war camps. Even if relations between their divorced parents are civil, children will experience all their family bonds as tenuous, simply because post-divorce households are less stable and are in constant flux, with an ever-changing cast of step-parents, stepchildren, and half-siblings.</p> <p>Here and there, she offers up helpful hints for parents trying to make the best of a bad deal. If only, if only, she were not so relentlessly negative. The idea that it might, under some circumstances, be possible to parent well after divorce is an idea she and the rest of the Marriage Movement can only entertain in the abstract. The divorced mothers and fathers in her own case studies are, almost without exception, emotional cripples who have no idea what their children want or need or think.</p> <p>Is this fair or representative? If I run through the roster of all the divorced people I've ever known, I can think of a few who drifted into divorce almost on a whim, were blind to their children's needs, and used their children as pawns in their war with the other parent. But I can think of many more who have managed, very much against the odds, to work together with exes to keep their children's lives as 'normal' as they can. If anything, these struggling-to-be good-enough parents spend more time thinking about how to raise a child well than they did pre-divorce. They have no choice but to think more: they are grappling with dilemmas for which they have no context and no preparation. It is another case of dancing a dance without ever having seen it. But at least they try.</p> <p>Here are just a few stories I've heard from divorced or divorcing friends and colleagues over the past week:</p> <p><b> 1</b> A man whose decree absolute isn't a month old yet, who still looks after his children in the matrimonial home every other weekend. But he's beginning to feel like an intruder there, and his ex seems to feel the same, because she's been leaving him the sorts of notes you'd leave for your new cleaner. Should he complain or just get on with finding a new house?</p> <p><b> 2</b> A woman who has been vacating her house every other weekend for a year now, so that her ex can have time with the children. But lately it's been getting on her nerves, because he sleeps in her bed and goes through all her things. She thinks she should draw the line, but she doesn't want to rock the boat, because she's broke, and doing a course, and desperate for free childcare.</p> <p><b> 3</b> A woman who, after barring her sometimes violent ex from seeing her son for years, has decided the boy needs a male parental influence now that he's entering his teens. So she has invited the ex over. The ex seems overjoyed to have a second chance. But how to make sure he never resorts to the fist?</p> <p><b> 4</b> A man who is almost in mourning because his ex suddenly backed out of her promise to let their son live with him once he was of school age. He feels she's betrayed him, but he doesn't want to risk losing the boy altogether by taking his case to court.</p> <p><b> 5</b> A woman who finally got around to introducing the man she has been seeing for over a year now to her daughters, only to see the two girls go into a tailspin. Should she give up on a love life for their sake, or tell the girls they're just going to have to get used to it?</p> <p><b> 6</b> A woman who, after initiating a divorce two years ago, got cold feet when she found out that her ex now has a new girlfriend. She thinks it's too late to get him back. For the same reason she's reluctant for her children to spend time with the new woman. But would it be wrong for her to ask him to see the children less while she gets used to the new situation?</p> <p><b> 7</b> A man who has not been allowed to see his daughter for five years, in tears because she just answered a letter, and she took the trouble to draw a flower next to her name. Does this mean he'll be able to see her again one day? He does not dare ask. He has to be patient, wait for her to come to him.</p> <p>Their children have different, even more wrenching dilemmas. One young child cries every time her father leaves the house to go to his new flat, not because she misses him, but because she is afraid he might trip on his way out and fall into their pond and drown.</p> <p>Another older child is put out because she has to share her bedroom with a new stepsister who, in spite of being the same age, wants to go to bed two hours earlier. This, she thinks, could ruin her life. But she doesn't want to mention it to her father, 'who worried enough already'.</p> <p>A boy in his late teens who has been commuting between houses for 12 years talks about how tense he feels when he first arrives at his mum's. He feels obliged to sit in the kitchen and talk to her, when really he just wants to go upstairs and flop on his bed and listen to loud music.</p> <p>Another used to be upset that his parents didn't speak to one another. But then when he wanted a scooter the other week, he told each parent that the other was refusing to pay for it, and they both took pity on him and gave him the full amount. Which was great, he said, until the guilt kicked in. How to give the money back without having to tell them he lied?</p> <p>None of these stories is an advertisement for the 'post-divorce lifestyle'. But there is one thing they all have in common: they are about people who are trying to 'do the right thing'. If Wallerstein's diligent research fails to highlight this slightly brighter story, it is because it is asking the wrong questions. Instead of staying neutral - asking how life is different in post-divorce families - it asks how children in post-divorce families are damaged. So there is always a moral agenda there. The desire to promote marriage and discourage divorce is stronger than the desire to look at all the facts.</p> <p>So what are the facts? If you look at other new research on divorce, it soon becomes clear that not all post-divorce families are doomed. There are things that make life easier for children and there are things that make life worse. For example, a recent study of co-parented children carried out by Carol Smart, Amanda Wade and Bren Neale of the University of Leeds found that children had a hard time when they were travelling between parents who were hostile to each other.</p> <p>They also said that they missed their friends when staying with a parent who did not live close to them. They said there were some benefits to having 'two of everything' (for example at birthdays and Christmas) and that this sometimes made up for the lack of a settled home. While they hated any situation that forced them to choose one parent over another, they spoke about the importance of 'being fair' to both parents by making sure they gave each enough time.</p> <p>The children who were happiest with their lives were the ones who felt that their parents consulted them before making big decisions. The ones who were least happy were the ones who did not feel they could talk to their parents and believed they had no say about how their time was organised.</p> <p>One of the aims of this study was to shed the dark, damage-fearing frame of reference used by Wallerstein and the Marriage Movement, and to try and understand family life post-divorce as children themselves understood it. In addition to publishing its results in the usual way, the authors also published a moving book called Parent Problems! in conjunction with Young Voice. Except in the short introduction, there are no adult voices here, just direct quotes from the 52 children who took part in the study. These children have important things to say, not just to other children and divorced parents but to all of us.</p> <p>Much of it runs counter to received ideas about what children want, and what matters most to them. And what mattered most to these children was not the shape of the household per se but the quality of the relationships they had - not just with their parents, but with their step-parents, their siblings, their grandparents, their friends, and even their pets. They did not see themselves as passive partners in any of these relationships. Rather, they saw themselves as helping to make them what they were. They tried hard to be fair, and to respect other people's feelings, to do the right thing.</p> <p>A similar if somewhat darker picture emerges in another new book, Connecting Children, by Julia Brannen, Helen Heptinstall, and Kalwant Bhopal of the Thomas Coram Research Centre at the University of London. The book arises out of a small but wide-ranging study of care and family life as seen and constructed by children aged between 10 and 12 in different types of families. Echoing the Leeds study, it found that most children in single-parent or post-divorce families thought it was better when both parents could give their children time and attention. They also believed that they should have a say in major family decisions like divorce. But there was, Brannen notes, a troubling silence in a number of the children that indicated a large gap between their ideals and their everyday experience. Family remained a powerful symbol for all of them. The children who clung to it most passionately were the ones in foster care. It is possible, says Brannen, that what they are really talking about here are 'the basic conditions of love'. However, they express their desire in terms of family structure.</p> <p>As do we all. Is it possible to maintain strong ties between parents and children outside traditional marriage? What will happen if the answer is no? If we have always depended on families to look after their young and their old and their weak, what can we expect in a world where there is no lasting sense of family obligation? Those are the questions at the root of the anti-divorce campaign. They are not so very different from the questions that parents and children ask themselves as they struggle to keep things going in the wake of a divorce. The difference is in the way each group asks the questions. Instead of being couched in the anxious, negative abstract-plural, the questions of post-divorce parents and children are rooted in the present and the specific. How am I going to tell my ex to stop treating me like a servant without dragging the children into it? How can I be civil to my ex's new wife when to tell the truth I hate her guts? How can I let my daughter know my door is always open to her, without making her feel guilty about staying out of touch so long? How can I tell my father I miss him without hurting my mother? How am I ever going to feel at home in both my homes?</p> <p>All of these questions are about the same things: how to keep family ties and obligations alive, even when they are no longer sanctified by marriage. How to bring up children together in an atmosphere of mutual respect, even when you're no longer sharing the same bed. How to be kind to an ex-spouse you hate, because you both love the same children. How to be fair to both parents, without telling lies or splitting yourself into two. They are questions people have always had to agonise over. If they have added urgency today, it's with good reason. For the past 30 years, we have, as Judith Wallerstein points out, been engaged on a vast social experiment. Never before have so many children grown up outside traditional two-parent families.</p> <p>It is possible that 50 years from now, we'll all look back and shake our heads and wonder why it was ever allowed. But it is equally possible that we'll have decided by then that, in certain circumstances, divorce really is the only option, and that it is possible to bring up children well after divorce, at least if you bear in mind certain all-important principles.</p> <p>It's beyond doubt that divorce does affect children, and adults, and not just for a little while, but forever. For anyone who knows this, divorce can never be an easy choice. But for better or for worse, it is a choice many of us have made or have had made for us and cannot unmake. And, to the extent that we do try to do the best we can, surely we, too, deserve respect. As do our children. We do not get it from the anti-divorce campaign, who treat us like waxworks in a horror museum. It's time they stopped.</p> <p><b>Children of the divorce revolution</b></p> <p>My family just IS. It's different from other people's families, but I don't mind because who says what a family should be like? <br>Hope, 14</p> <p>Having two homes is like putting your life in a couple of carrier bags every week.<br> Selina, 16</p> <p>Sometimes you feel fed up that you've got to have separate mums and separate dads, and you don't want to do it any more. But you can cope with it really, you get used to it\u0085You get on with your life.<br>Quentin, 13 and Pele, 10</p> <p>You should live with whoever is nearest to school, probably, but if your dad's, I don't know, a bit of a drunk or something or one of them cares for you more than the other, then it's obvious who you should choose - which isn't true in my case because they both care for me. <br>James, 12</p> <p>About a year ago I would come home from a weekend with Dad, and find it very hard to readjust - sometimes it's just too much. Mum was always very understanding and I used to have a lot of Mondays off school and then by the Tuesday I'd be fine.<br> Bob, 12</p> <p>When I go on holiday with each parent it's funny because I always miss the other one and you can't really tell your mum and dad because they think: 'Oh well, she just wants to be with her dad, and stuff, or mum.' So I keep it to myself. But I send them postcards and I normally take a picture of one of them when it's a long time.<br> Chelsea, 8</p> <p>I'd like it if mum and dad could get back together again. We swap over houses every day, but it would be nice to go somewhere with both your mum and dad.

I mean, there's a good side and a bad side to it as there is with everything. I'm just used to it. And I get on with my life.

But would it be wrong for her to ask him to see the children less while she gets used to the new situation? 7 A man who has not been allowed to see his daughter for five years, in tears because she just answered a letter, and she took the trouble to draw a flower next to her name. Does this mean he'll be able to see her again one day? He does not dare ask. He has to be patient, wait for her to come to him. Their children have different, even more wrenching dilemmas. One young child cries every time her father leaves the house to go to his new flat, not because she misses him, but because she is afraid he might trip on his way out and fall into their pond and drown. Another older child is put out because she has to share her bedroom with a new stepsister who, in spite of being the same age, wants to go to bed two hours earlier. This, she thinks, could ruin her life. But she doesn't want to mention it to her father, 'who worried enough already'. A boy in his late teens who has been commuting between houses for 12 years talks about how tense he feels when he first arrives at his mum's. He feels obliged to sit in the kitchen and talk to her, when really he just wants to go upstairs and flop on his bed and listen to loud music. Another used to be upset that his parents didn't speak to one another. But then when he wanted a scooter the other week, he told each parent that the other was refusing to pay for it, and they both took pity on him and gave him the full amount. Which was great, he said, until the guilt kicked in. How to give the money back without having to tell them he lied? None of these stories is an advertisement for the 'post-divorce lifestyle'. But there is one thing they all have in common: they are about people who are trying to 'do the right thing'. If Wallerstein's diligent research fails to highlight this slightly brighter story, it is because it is asking the wrong questions. Instead of staying neutral - asking how life is different in post-divorce families - it asks how children in post-divorce families are damaged. So there is always a moral agenda there. The desire to promote marriage and discourage divorce is stronger than the desire to look at all the facts. So what are the facts? If you look at other new research on divorce, it soon becomes clear that not all post-divorce families are doomed. There are things that make life easier for children and there are things that make life worse. For example, a recent study of co-parented children carried out by Carol Smart, Amanda Wade and Bren Neale of the University of Leeds found that children had a hard time when they were travelling between parents who were hostile to each other. They also said that they missed their friends when staying with a parent who did not live close to them. They said there were some benefits to having 'two of everything' (for example at birthdays and Christmas) and that this sometimes made up for the lack of a settled home. While they hated any situation that forced them to choose one parent over another, they spoke about the importance of 'being fair' to both parents by making sure they gave each enough time. The children who were happiest with their lives were the ones who felt that their parents consulted them before making big decisions. The ones who were least happy were the ones who did not feel they could talk to their parents and believed they had no say about how their time was organised. One of the aims of this study was to shed the dark, damage-fearing frame of reference used by Wallerstein and the Marriage Movement, and to try and understand family life post-divorce as children themselves understood it. In addition to publishing its results in the usual way, the authors also published a moving book called Parent Problems! in conjunction with Young Voice. Except in the short introduction, there are no adult voices here, just direct quotes from the 52 children who took part in the study. These children have important things to say, not just to other children and divorced parents but to all of us. Much of it runs counter to received ideas about what children want, and what matters most to them. And what mattered most to these children was not the shape of the household per se but the quality of the relationships they had - not just with their parents, but with their step-parents, their siblings, their grandparents, their friends, and even their pets. They did not see themselves as passive partners in any of these relationships. Rather, they saw themselves as helping to make them what they were. They tried hard to be fair, and to respect other people's feelings, to do the right thing. A similar if somewhat darker picture emerges in another new book, Connecting Children, by Julia Brannen, Helen Heptinstall, and Kalwant Bhopal of the Thomas Coram Research Centre at the University of London. The book arises out of a small but wide-ranging study of care and family life as seen and constructed by children aged between 10 and 12 in different types of families. Echoing the Leeds study, it found that most children in single-parent or post-divorce families thought it was better when both parents could give their children time and attention. They also believed that they should have a say in major family decisions like divorce. But there was, Brannen notes, a troubling silence in a number of the children that indicated a large gap between their ideals and their everyday experience. Family remained a powerful symbol for all of them. The children who clung to it most passionately were the ones in foster care. It is possible, says Brannen, that what they are really talking about here are 'the basic conditions of love'. However, they express their desire in terms of family structure. As do we all. Is it possible to maintain strong ties between parents and children outside traditional marriage? What will happen if the answer is no? If we have always depended on families to look after their young and their old and their weak, what can we expect in a world where there is no lasting sense of family obligation? Those are the questions at the root of the anti-divorce campaign. They are not so very different from the questions that parents and children ask themselves as they struggle to keep things going in the wake of a divorce. The difference is in the way each group asks the questions. Instead of being couched in the anxious, negative abstract-plural, the questions of post-divorce parents and children are rooted in the present and the specific. How am I going to tell my ex to stop treating me like a servant without dragging the children into it? How can I be civil to my ex's new wife when to tell the truth I hate her guts? How can I let my daughter know my door is always open to her, without making her feel guilty about staying out of touch so long? How can I tell my father I miss him without hurting my mother? How am I ever going to feel at home in both my homes? All of these questions are about the same things: how to keep family ties and obligations alive, even when they are no longer sanctified by marriage. How to bring up children together in an atmosphere of mutual respect, even when you're no longer sharing the same bed. How to be kind to an ex-spouse you hate, because you both love the same children. How to be fair to both parents, without telling lies or splitting yourself into two. They are questions people have always had to agonise over. If they have added urgency today, it's with good reason. For the past 30 years, we have, as Judith Wallerstein points out, been engaged on a vast social experiment. Never before have so many children grown up outside traditional two-parent families. It is possible that 50 years from now, we'll all look back and shake our heads and wonder why it was ever allowed. But it is equally possible that we'll have decided by then that, in certain circumstances, divorce really is the only option, and that it is possible to bring up children well after divorce, at least if you bear in mind certain all-important principles. It's beyond doubt that divorce does affect children, and adults, and not just for a little while, but forever. For anyone who knows this, divorce can never be an easy choice. But for better or for worse, it is a choice many of us have made or have had made for us and cannot unmake. And, to the extent that we do try to do the best we can, surely we, too, deserve respect. As do our children. We do not get it from the anti-divorce campaign, who treat us like waxworks in a horror museum. It's time they stopped. Children of the divorce revolution My family just IS. It's different from other people's families, but I don't mind because who says what a family should be like? Hope, 14 Having two homes is like putting your life in a couple of carrier bags every week. Selina, 16 Sometimes you feel fed up that you've got to have separate mums and separate dads, and you don't want to do it any more. But you can cope with it really, you get used to it\u0085You get on with your life. Quentin, 13 and Pele, 10 You should live with whoever is nearest to school, probably, but if your dad's, I don't know, a bit of a drunk or something or one of them cares for you more than the other, then it's obvious who you should choose - which isn't true in my case because they both care for me. James, 12 About a year ago I would come home from a weekend with Dad, and find it very hard to readjust - sometimes it's just too much. Mum was always very understanding and I used to have a lot of Mondays off school and then by the Tuesday I'd be fine. Bob, 12 When I go on holiday with each parent it's funny because I always miss the other one and you can't really tell your mum and dad because they think: 'Oh well, she just wants to be with her dad, and stuff, or mum.' So I keep it to myself. But I send them postcards and I normally take a picture of one of them when it's a long time. Chelsea, 8 I'd like it if mum and dad could get back together again. We swap over houses every day, but it would be nice to go somewhere with both your mum and dad. I ask Mum sometimes, but she doesn't want to. Harold, 11 I'm just so used to it I can't imagine it any other way. I mean, there's a good side and a bad side to it as there is with everything. I'm just used to it. And I get on with my life. I quite enjoy it. Anna, 16 \u0095 Quotes taken from Parent Problems! Children's Views on Life when Parents Split Up by Bren Neale and Amanda Wade Who's who in the anti-divorce movement America The Institute for American Values (IAV) has fuelled and shaped the divorce debate for over 10 years. It has 2,300 influential members and supporters in intellectual and government circles. Supporters include: Judith Wallerstein, author of 'The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce' Amitai Etzioni, author of 'The Spirit of Community', the bestseller that introduced communitarianism. Bill Clinton was an early fan. David Blankenhorn, high-profile president of the IAV and chairman of the National Fatherhood Initiative. David Popenoe, outspoken sociology professor and author of 'Disturbing the Nest' and 'Life Without Father'. Francis Fukuyama, author of 'The End of History' and 'The Great Disruption', in which he argues that sexual equality has caused social breakdown . Britain Demos and the Centre for Policy Research are both committed to the debate. So too are: Home Secretary Jack Straw, who drafted the Government's 'new family policy', which aims to 'protect children by strengthening marriage'. Straw is also a supporter of the pro-marriage guide to be given to all couples planning to wed from next year. Helen Wilkinson, who co-founded Demos and helped draft Straw's 'new family policy'. She once proposed 'time-limited' marriage for childless couples. Melanie Phillips, newspaper columnist and author of 'The Sex Change Society', which argues that the state has destroyed marriage by acting as breadwinner for a nation of single mothers. \u0095 Parent Problems!

      "body": "<b>Matthew Collings says yes</b> <br> <p> I think the Turner Prize is an indisputably good and valuable cultural event. It gets people talking about creativity and ideas. Anyone can go and you can say what you like. You can turn on the tap marked furious: 'Grr, Duchamp, Huff puff, videos!' Or you can be a bit more factual and observant. Actually the second is better. But no one has to be craven about it. Be ruthless if you like. Inside the Turner Prize last Sunday, I was amazed how crowded it was. The crowds looked at everything in a serious and concentrated way. I saw the architect Charles Jencks in the Wolfgang Tillmans exhibit - 'hey,' I thought, 'the man who invented the term postmodernism looking at some postmodernist stuff'. In the space where the video portraits of the exhibiting artists are shown, I heard my voiceover on the Tomoko Takahashi film. Word Perhect, with its deliberate wrong spelling, is Takahashi's internet project. But this was the first time I'd seen the film, directed by Chris Rodley for Illuminations, the independent film company, in its smoothed-out, edited and glossed version. Takahashi seemed nice, I thought, sympathetic. Actually, I can't stand her work. But now, with the audience so numerous and attentive and thoughtful and the film so enjoyable, I had to strain to remember why not. </p> <p>I feel jaded about the work's self-conscious, student-like attempts at feeble meanings. The accident log- book left lying around as if it meant something; the word 'structural' on its side next to a sideways fire-exit sign. The studied non-studiedness of her arrangements and the naive chasing after a look that's been familiar in galleries all over Europe and America for 10 years. </p> <p>But others might be thinking the same kind of thing, behind their politeness - that this is a spoiled kid, her twee pilings praised by the Progressive Parents in Viz. Or that Raedecker is a bit thin. Brown a bit dry. And Tillmans is a trendy. The prize is there to put this inner, art-world art out for everyone to have a look at and have his own thoughts. There's no rule that says the thoughts have to be pious. A jaded response isn't necessarily a morbid or nihilistic one. </p> <p>Since the shortlist was announced, I've come round more to Glenn Brown but at first I didn't care much about any of them. I had no idea why Tillmans is supposed to be an artist and everything I'd seen of Takahashi and Raedecker seemed bland. Raedecker seems very unaesthetic for someone who's supposed to be bringing aesthetic painting back into the limelight. </p> <p>There are some mysteries about the Turner Prize, some more mysterious than others. It's not a genuine popular vote. It is genuinely an exclusive institution. It's an exclusive prize that pretends to be an open one. But that's an acceptable bit of hypocrisy. As to genuine mysteries - how much power over the judges does the head judge, Nicholas Serota, really have? A few years ago, he was the big supporter of painter Sean Scully when it was Scully against sculptor Rachel Whiteread - but Whiteread won. So we don't know. And is a statement being made each year by the choice of winner - women are in, photography is it, painting is back, shocks are in, shocks are out? If Serota has the power, is he making the statement? If he doesn't, who does? We don't know this either. </p> <p>Whether it's strategic or not, it sends out a message. If Tillmans wins, the message will be that the Tate, like a youth-friendly vicar, wants to get down and boogie in an embarrassing way with youthful airheads who read the Face. If it's Glenn Brown, the statement will be yes to painting and a world of paintings but no to aesthetics, yes to a perverse kind of fascination or something. (This would be my choice but it's not my idea of importance in art.) If it's Raedecker, yes to an aesthetic dimension if it's neat and formulaic. If it's Takahashi, it will be yes to jolly-gosh enthusiasm. </p> <p>Are the judges a sinister power \u00e9lite? This isn't a mystery - they're quite bland power people of the art world. They don't set trends or have ideas; they follow them. The Turner Prize isn't responsible for art being how it is. With all its corporate smoothing-up over the last 10 years, it hasn't changed art, it's followed the way art has changed itself. </p> <p> \u0095 Matthew Collings presents the Turner Prize 2000 on C4, 28 November at 8pm </p> <p><b>Howard Jacobson says no </b><br></p> <p>Show me the judges before you ask me to value the prize. Then show me who picked the judges. </p> <p>It's a well-rehearsed argument against the Turner Prize that there are shadowy influences on it; that there are never dissident critics on the jury; that the principle of public involvement in the nomination process is a sham; and that the chairman of the jury is forever Sir Nicholas Serota, director of what was the old Tate and the reason we have a new one. </p> <p>Myself, I think the invariable presence of Serota gives the prize a transparency, not to say a professionalism, the Booker lacks. Know what Serota is about and you understand the Turner Prize. Burning with a hard, gem-like flame, Serota has used the prize to turn up the temperature of artistic awareness in this country, to the point where we are deserving of Tate Modern, our own palace of contemporary aesthetics. No small achievement, but have the means justified the ends? </p> <p>Measureless caverns of conceptualism and the best hamburgers in London, but a generation of artists who have lost their way, who are neither educated nor gifted, and cohorts of cowed critics and curators, each one willing to talk more drivel than the last. </p> <p>It was probably never a good idea, intellectually, for a public gallery to run a major art prize. A public gallery, by its very nature, is prisoner to happenstance. </p> <p>Conceptualism occurred, conceptualism must be shown. You and I know that conceptualism has not thrown up a single work worth looking at, but a gallery can't afford to know that. </p> <p>In its association with the Tate, the Turner confused its function. It wanted to be up to the minute, it wanted to be a record of now, but sometimes now is not all that interesting. </p> <p>Marcel Duchamp usually cops the blame for now, but the famous pissoir only pissed on art, it did not kill it. It introduced the found object, questioned the aura of the gallery, and taught artists who were otherwise at a loose end to be pranksters. For most of the century, it served as subplot to the main event - Picasso, Matisse, Bacon, you name them - those who were still willing to risk everything in the name of being serious. </p> <p>In the early years of the Turner, before Channel 4 stepped in and made it a televisable event, before it had an upper age limit of 50, ie before it became sexy, artists of substance contended for the prize. It's only in the last 10 years that the children of Duchamp have run away with it. </p> <p>The connection is blindingly obvious. If you want it young, you don't want it serious; if you want it sexy, you don't want it earnest; if you want it fashionable, you want it throwaway. And exactly the right art happened to be at hand, still fulfilling its function as light relief from weightier concerns. </p> <p>Enter the jokers. The rude girls, the self-promoters, the empty-wallers, the body-parters, the failed filmmakers, the failed window-dressers, the pseudo-painters for whom irony at the expense of paint is paint's only point. If there's an artistic equivalent of genocide, then the Turner Prize is guilty of it. Over the course of 10 years, it has tried to wipe out the idea of the disinterestedly serious artist.

      "bodyText": "Matthew Collings says yes I think the Turner Prize is an indisputably good and valuable cultural event. It gets people talking about creativity and ideas. Anyone can go and you can say what you like. You can turn on the tap marked furious: 'Grr, Duchamp, Huff puff, videos!' Or you can be a bit more factual and observant. Actually the second is better. But no one has to be craven about it. Be ruthless if you like. Inside the Turner Prize last Sunday, I was amazed how crowded it was. The crowds looked at everything in a serious and concentrated way. I saw the architect Charles Jencks in the Wolfgang Tillmans exhibit - 'hey,' I thought, 'the man who invented the term postmodernism looking at some postmodernist stuff'. In the space where the video portraits of the exhibiting artists are shown, I heard my voiceover on the Tomoko Takahashi film. Word Perhect, with its deliberate wrong spelling, is Takahashi's internet project. But this was the first time I'd seen the film, directed by Chris Rodley for Illuminations, the independent film company, in its smoothed-out, edited and glossed version. Takahashi seemed nice, I thought, sympathetic. Actually, I can't stand her work. But now, with the audience so numerous and attentive and thoughtful and the film so enjoyable, I had to strain to remember why not. I feel jaded about the work's self-conscious, student-like attempts at feeble meanings. The accident log- book left lying around as if it meant something; the word 'structural' on its side next to a sideways fire-exit sign. The studied non-studiedness of her arrangements and the naive chasing after a look that's been familiar in galleries all over Europe and America for 10 years. But others might be thinking the same kind of thing, behind their politeness - that this is a spoiled kid, her twee pilings praised by the Progressive Parents in Viz. Or that Raedecker is a bit thin. Brown a bit dry. And Tillmans is a trendy. The prize is there to put this inner, art-world art out for everyone to have a look at and have his own thoughts. There's no rule that says the thoughts have to be pious. A jaded response isn't necessarily a morbid or nihilistic one. Since the shortlist was announced, I've come round more to Glenn Brown but at first I didn't care much about any of them. I had no idea why Tillmans is supposed to be an artist and everything I'd seen of Takahashi and Raedecker seemed bland. Raedecker seems very unaesthetic for someone who's supposed to be bringing aesthetic painting back into the limelight. There are some mysteries about the Turner Prize, some more mysterious than others. It's not a genuine popular vote. It is genuinely an exclusive institution. It's an exclusive prize that pretends to be an open one. But that's an acceptable bit of hypocrisy. As to genuine mysteries - how much power over the judges does the head judge, Nicholas Serota, really have? A few years ago, he was the big supporter of painter Sean Scully when it was Scully against sculptor Rachel Whiteread - but Whiteread won. So we don't know. And is a statement being made each year by the choice of winner - women are in, photography is it, painting is back, shocks are in, shocks are out? If Serota has the power, is he making the statement? If he doesn't, who does? We don't know this either. Whether it's strategic or not, it sends out a message. If Tillmans wins, the message will be that the Tate, like a youth-friendly vicar, wants to get down and boogie in an embarrassing way with youthful airheads who read the Face. If it's Glenn Brown, the statement will be yes to painting and a world of paintings but no to aesthetics, yes to a perverse kind of fascination or something. (This would be my choice but it's not my idea of importance in art.) If it's Raedecker, yes to an aesthetic dimension if it's neat and formulaic. If it's Takahashi, it will be yes to jolly-gosh enthusiasm. Are the judges a sinister power \u00e9lite? This isn't a mystery - they're quite bland power people of the art world. They don't set trends or have ideas; they follow them. The Turner Prize isn't responsible for art being how it is. With all its corporate smoothing-up over the last 10 years, it hasn't changed art, it's followed the way art has changed itself. \u0095 Matthew Collings presents the Turner Prize 2000 on C4, 28 November at 8pm Howard Jacobson says no Show me the judges before you ask me to value the prize. Then show me who picked the judges. It's a well-rehearsed argument against the Turner Prize that there are shadowy influences on it; that there are never dissident critics on the jury; that the principle of public involvement in the nomination process is a sham; and that the chairman of the jury is forever Sir Nicholas Serota, director of what was the old Tate and the reason we have a new one. Myself, I think the invariable presence of Serota gives the prize a transparency, not to say a professionalism, the Booker lacks. Know what Serota is about and you understand the Turner Prize. Burning with a hard, gem-like flame, Serota has used the prize to turn up the temperature of artistic awareness in this country, to the point where we are deserving of Tate Modern, our own palace of contemporary aesthetics. No small achievement, but have the means justified the ends? Measureless caverns of conceptualism and the best hamburgers in London, but a generation of artists who have lost their way, who are neither educated nor gifted, and cohorts of cowed critics and curators, each one willing to talk more drivel than the last. It was probably never a good idea, intellectually, for a public gallery to run a major art prize. A public gallery, by its very nature, is prisoner to happenstance. Conceptualism occurred, conceptualism must be shown. You and I know that conceptualism has not thrown up a single work worth looking at, but a gallery can't afford to know that. In its association with the Tate, the Turner confused its function. It wanted to be up to the minute, it wanted to be a record of now, but sometimes now is not all that interesting. Marcel Duchamp usually cops the blame for now, but the famous pissoir only pissed on art, it did not kill it. It introduced the found object, questioned the aura of the gallery, and taught artists who were otherwise at a loose end to be pranksters. For most of the century, it served as subplot to the main event - Picasso, Matisse, Bacon, you name them - those who were still willing to risk everything in the name of being serious. In the early years of the Turner, before Channel 4 stepped in and made it a televisable event, before it had an upper age limit of 50, ie before it became sexy, artists of substance contended for the prize. It's only in the last 10 years that the children of Duchamp have run away with it. The connection is blindingly obvious. If you want it young, you don't want it serious; if you want it sexy, you don't want it earnest; if you want it fashionable, you want it throwaway. And exactly the right art happened to be at hand, still fulfilling its function as light relief from weightier concerns. Enter the jokers. The rude girls, the self-promoters, the empty-wallers, the body-parters, the failed filmmakers, the failed window-dressers, the pseudo-painters for whom irony at the expense of paint is paint's only point. If there's an artistic equivalent of genocide, then the Turner Prize is guilty of it. Over the course of 10 years, it has tried to wipe out the idea of the disinterestedly serious artist. If you want to be in the money, it has effectively told young artists, don't do it that way, do it this. Else perish. Hence the new phenomenon in art schools of a sort of avant-garde Thatcherism. In a famously uncultured Turner Prize address, Charles Saatchi wondered what the YBAs were putting in their cornflakes, to be doing so well. Success being the measure, hunting for what went into the cornflakes became the art school's first concern. Now, if a student isn't tied up by a gallery and selling nicely before his degree show, he might as well smash up his neon tubing. Since refinement of technique is no more the valued currency than maturity of feeling, why hang around for either? As for your bona fides as a member of the avant garde, those come to you automatically with the tidbits of nursery nihilism you've snacked on in your theory classes. Which is also how - and this is the true mark of a Turner likely - you can be delinquent and holier-than-thou, all at once. Get rich quick and turn your nose up at the bourgeoisie. In order for us to have Xanadu on Bankside, did the Turner Prize have to be footling, fearful, exclusivist, predictable, ignorant and a slave to some of the worst theoretical writing in the history of human thought?

      "body": "<p>Saturday night isn't what is used to be. Where once it was the climax of the week, the consummation of Sunday-to-Friday's social, sexual and sartorial fantasies, these days it's an empty space, waiting to be filled with activity and meaning. You might choose to spend the dying hours of the week reading, gardening or having a particularly elaborate bath. You could decide to go round to a friend's to watch a video or you might simply start painting your spare room. One thing you won't be doing, not if you're the least bit cool anyway, is getting ready for a Big Night Out. </p> <p>Admitting that you spent last Saturday night at a club, pub, party, restaurant or even cinema is the new social solecism. There are ways round it, of course. You can pretend that an old college friend was visiting from out of town and 'dragged you out' (make a little face of amused disgust at this point). Or you could say that your partner had just arrived back from the States that morning so shaken up by jetlag, poor darling, that he lost track of the days. But don't, whatever you do, say that you went out on Saturday because you were after a good time. </p> <p>Whether you live in London, Manchester or some outsized village, Saturday is the worst night of the week to head into town. It's difficult to get a reservation at your favourite restaurant and, if you do, then you'll almost certainly find yourself sitting next to a group of 16 people singing 'Happy Birthday' over and over again. The buses are packed with people being sick and it's impossible to find a cab home. With good reason, New Yorkers call it 'Amateur Night'. </p> <p>At its worst, Saturday has the capacity to spoil everything it touches. Neighbourhoods which exude stylish cool from Sunday to Monday, turn into sixth-form discos on Saturday night. Even Hoxton seems horrible when there's a crocodile of carefully dressed visitors queuing patiently around every second building. </p> <p>Nor is it just what Saturday brings that makes it naff, but what you bring to Saturday. Carol Harris, 40, a film executive living in Manchester, believes that it's the 'special occasion' connotations that make the slot so unappetising. She remembers her parents taking her every year to a restaurant on the Saturday nearest her birthday. 'We'd all get dressed up, with my dad wearing a blazer and my mum a long skirt, and there'd always be a row on the way home because expectations had been so high.' These days, Caroline eats out three times a week rather than once a year and, unsurprisingly, always avoids Saturday. </p> <p>None of this comes as any surprise to researchers at the Henley Centre, who are just about to publish a report with creative consultancy Pearlfisher called 'The Night-Mode of the Future'. The 30- and 40-year-olds who opened up their evenings to scrutiny reported that, while they still liked to visit clubs and restaurants, they weren't interested in the accompanying hassle. </p> <p>It's a confidence thing, says Rachel Clare of the Henley Centre: 'When you're 25, you're much more worried about whether you're dressed right and whether you'll get past the doorman. By the time you're 35, you're only interested in the quality of the experience. If it takes too long to get served, then you assume there's something wrong with the bar, rather than there's anything lacking in you.' </p> <p>This concentration on the content of the moment, rather than its cumbersome cultural connotations, means that in some cities the coolest time to go clubbing is now Sunday afternoon. 'Thirtysomething parents don't find Saturday a particularly convenient time to go out, so increasingly they're leaving their children with the grandparents after Sunday lunch and heading out to their favourite clubs,' explains Clare. Once deep inside the building, you'd be hard-pressed to know that anything was amiss: the music, drinks and vibe all suggest 'Saturday' even if outside people are getting ready to go to church. </p> <p>Younger people, too, are avoiding the clich\u00e9 of Saturday, preferring to concentrate their efforts on Friday. For that reason it's never been easier to get a teenage babysitter, even if you have to suffer amused contempt in the process. 'Two Saturdays ago, I booked a neighbour's daughter to look after the children so that my husband and I could have a rare evening out together,' recalls London mother Louise Carpenter, 38. 'As we went into the sitting-room to say goodbye, I could see Sarah looking at us with a kind of pity. There we were, all dressed up and heading off at 7pm on a Saturday, and I suddenly saw just how sad, old and naff we must look.' </p> <p>The irony of Saturday is that we don't need it any more. Historically, it developed as a night of pleasure and expenditure at a time when factories, offices and schools worked right through until 4pm on a Saturday. As recently as the 1970s, manual workers, bank clerks and schoolboys all looked forward to Saturday night as their first free time of the week. A full pay packet and six days' worth of frustrations and desires produced a pressure-cooker atmosphere in pubs and clubs around the country. These days, flexible working patterns and Sunday trading mean that there's no need or reason to focus all your hopes on those few hours. You might just as well go to a party on Tuesday, shop at midnight on Thursday and spend Saturday evening catching up on your paperwork. </p> <p>All the same, old patterns die hard and it's still easy to feel that you ought to be doing something 'special' on a Saturday night. After all, it takes a certain confidence to admit to your friends that while they were out having dinner, you were busy tidying a cupboard. 'I lie about it, actually,' confesses Susan Martin, a 35-year-old copywriter. 'When people ask me on a Monday morning what I did at the weekend, I always make up something for Saturday night. It just sounds too sad, otherwise.' </p> <p>Even saying that you stayed home with your partner can seem suspect. It's all right at the beginning of a relationship because everyone assumes you're too busy having great sex to go out. But after the first six months it starts to look as though you're stuck in some strange folie \u00e0 deux which stops you interacting healthily with others. </p> <p>If you suffer from this kind of Saturday complex, then you're about to feel very uncomfortable indeed. With the dawning of December, the Saturday effect starts to spread to other days of the week. Suddenly, it starts to seem odd if you don't have a really exciting time lined up for Thursday. By the time it gets to the 18th, even Monday will need to be filled with something sparkly-sounding. The only day you don't have to do anything, of course, is Saturday itself. Because that just wouldn't be cool.</p>",

'Two Saturdays ago, I booked a neighbour's daughter to look after the children so that my husband and I could have a rare evening out together,' recalls London mother Louise Carpenter, 38. 'As we went into the sitting-room to say goodbye, I could see Sarah looking at us with a kind of pity. There we were, all dressed up and heading off at 7pm on a Saturday, and I suddenly saw just how sad, old and naff we must look.' The irony of Saturday is that we don't need it any more. Historically, it developed as a night of pleasure and expenditure at a time when factories, offices and schools worked right through until 4pm on a Saturday. As recently as the 1970s, manual workers, bank clerks and schoolboys all looked forward to Saturday night as their first free time of the week. A full pay packet and six days' worth of frustrations and desires produced a pressure-cooker atmosphere in pubs and clubs around the country. These days, flexible working patterns and Sunday trading mean that there's no need or reason to focus all your hopes on those few hours. You might just as well go to a party on Tuesday, shop at midnight on Thursday and spend Saturday evening catching up on your paperwork. All the same, old patterns die hard and it's still easy to feel that you ought to be doing something 'special' on a Saturday night. After all, it takes a certain confidence to admit to your friends that while they were out having dinner, you were busy tidying a cupboard. 'I lie about it, actually,' confesses Susan Martin, a 35-year-old copywriter. 'When people ask me on a Monday morning what I did at the weekend, I always make up something for Saturday night. It just sounds too sad, otherwise.' Even saying that you stayed home with your partner can seem suspect. It's all right at the beginning of a relationship because everyone assumes you're too busy having great sex to go out. But after the first six months it starts to look as though you're stuck in some strange folie \u00e0 deux which stops you interacting healthily with others. If you suffer from this kind of Saturday complex, then you're about to feel very uncomfortable indeed. With the dawning of December, the Saturday effect starts to spread to other days of the week. Suddenly, it starts to seem odd if you don't have a really exciting time lined up for Thursday. By the time it gets to the 18th, even Monday will need to be filled with something sparkly-sounding. The only day you don't have to do anything, of course, is Saturday itself. Because that just wouldn't be cool.",

The 35-year-old Lou Ye's film, a beguiling affair reminiscent of Wong Kar-Wai's Hong Kong pictures, is largely viewed through the eyes or lens of an anonymous, unseen videographer living in a flat overlooking the River Suzhou, the waterway that separates downtown Shanghai from the industrial suburb of Hong-ku. </p> <p>The Suzhou is a metaphor for the merging of the old and the new China, its now polluted waters flowing relentlessly, throwing up waste and dead bodies, its banks lined with derelict, pre-war warehouses that are being pulled down and replaced by anonymous tower blocks.

He falls for this flighty number, films her obsessively, and they become lovers. The mermaid, Lou Ye has pointed out, is 'a Western import like Coca-Cola and McDonald's', with no roots in traditional Chinese culture. </p> <p>But Meimei has another, equally obsessive admirer, the motorcycle courier Mar dar (Jia Hongsheng), a handsome dropout recently released from jail, and the jealous videographer reconstructs Mardar's story from the man's own testimony and other sources. It transpires that Mardar had been hired to look after Moudan (also played by Zhou Xun), the wilful schoolgirl daughter of a crook specialising in contraband Russian vodka. She develops a crush on him, and when he becomes involved in kidnapping her she feels betrayed and throws herself into the Suzhou, clutching a mermaid doll. Does she now haunt its murky waters like some creature from a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, or has she reappeared, or perhaps been reincarnated as Meimei, the night-club mermaid? Could Meimei perhaps be exploiting, playing up to, Mardar's necrophilic guilt? </p> <p>The dreamlike quality of this swooningly romantic story is enhanced by the hand-held camerawork that presents it as the videographer's subjective impressions. But it takes place in the neon-lit, glamorously garish world of film noir, and the picture recalls the mood of a 1930s French film in the Marcel Carn\u00e9 poetic-realist mode and also, of course, Alfred Hitchcock. </p> <p>One of Hitchcock's few excursions outside the thriller was the romantically surreal Rich and Strange , which took its title from Ariel's song in The Tempest about suffering 'a sea change into something rich and strange', and was released in the States as East of Shanghai . Suzhou River is a homage to Vertigo, and the heroine's name 'Moudan' is a Chinese whisper of Madeleine, the captivating woman played by Kim Novak whom James Stewart seeks to re-create.

      "body": "<p><strong> She Was Black</strong><br> Rambert Dance Co, Sadler's Wells, London EC1 </p> <p><strong> Ondine, Shadowplay</strong><br> Royal Ballet, ROH, London WC2 </p> <p> A thing haunts the surreal ballet by Mats Ek that opened Rambert's two-week London season. The title, <strong> She Was Black</strong>, is the answer to a question about the nature of God. The shapeless, wriggling Thing lurks like a bad conscience. Ignored until the final moments of the ballet, she - for the creature that emerges from its chrysalis-shroud is female - could be the human soul. Or a black joke. </p> <p>This is the first time that Ek's choreography has been danced by a British company. Until the Cullberg Ballet from Sweden brought his ballets to the 1999 Edinburgh Festival, Ek's work had only been seen here on television. (Sadler's Wells hopes to present his disturbing version of Swan Lake next year, money permitting). Because Ek's take on the world is so unfamiliar, it is all the more refreshing. In Christopher Bruce's Sergeant Early's Dream (from 1984) on the same programme, the hopes and fears of its cast of Irish immigrants are common currency. Ek's Scandinavian family members are bizarrely unpredictable. </p> <p> She Was Black appears to be set in a cavernous kitchen. A married couple spar, driven by a dual need to torment each other. His hat serves as her pudding bowl, her skirt as his snot-rag. He treats her like a dog; she tries to hump him in sexual frustration. Enter a horde of black and red onlookers, who sit in judgment on them, a jury of children, servants or neighbours, perched on a staircase. These characters then have their own dances, as blunt and vehement as cut-out cartoons. </p> <p>Henryk Gorecki's Second String Quartet veers between ominously sliding harmonies and urgent throbbing. Its nightmare quality is reflected in the appearance of a man gliding on pointe, briefly naked except for his hat and toe-shoes. Maybe he's a fantasy of harmony between the sexes, who are otherwise at each other's throats and groins. Perhaps the Thing is his dream, an enigmatic shape enveloped in a black rubbish bag. </p> <p>It visits itself upon the hapless household, witness ing the guilty secrets that are locked into closets. In the end, the monster has to be acknowledged. No longer despised as garbage, she sloughs off her sack and dances. She has a human form and voice (a recorded throat-music song), though she is still pretty strange. That's fine by Ek - his compassion extends to the low-liest outcast. </p> <p>The Rambert dancers embody his vision with complete conviction. Since they have been coached by the choreographer himself, we are free to make our own interpretations - they know what theirs is. The Royal Ballet has not had that advantage with its recent revivals of works by Antony Tudor and Frederick Ashton, who are both dead. Neither Tudor's <strong> Shadowplay</strong> nor Ashton's <strong> Ondine</strong> coheres as a ballet. Yet there are such marvellous moments in both that one longs for the productions to be pulled into shape, reorganised to be seen with new eyes. </p> <p> Shadowplay was coming to life by its last performance on Monday, with Edward Watson as the Boy With Matted Hair (or floppy red locks, in his case). He teetered between gaucheness and elegance. Determined to understand every step of his journey, he took us with him. In an ideal cast, he should be confronted by more formidable seducers than Jane Burn and David Pickering, but at least some alert intelligences were at play. </p> <p> Ondine, last revived on the Sadler's Wells stage when the Royal Ballet was homeless, is better framed in the Opera House. It is a strange mixture of painterly and papier mch\u00e9, both in Lila di Nobili's designs and the dancers' interpretations. Jonathan Cope as the hero, Palemon, reverted to the cardboard cypher he used to be before Sylvie Guillem took him on. Sarah Wildor as the wilful water nymph of the title aroused little response from him, even though she was enchanting. </p> <p>Ondine is supposed to have no soul, which should make her even more alien than Ek's black Thing. But Wildor can't help being a warm-hearted mermaid, full of remorse at the devastation she brings about so unthinkingly. She cradles her drowned lover with genuine emotion, while her fellow sprites sway in the currents around them, looking like ghostly Blake watercolours. </p> <p>Ashton's imagination conjures up images that modern technology ought to be able to realise more effectively than the clapped-out stage machinery he was using in 1958. True, the shipboard scene in Act II is initially a triumph of painted gauzes, but nobody on deck believes in the storm or the invasion of nymphs and tritons, flapping bits of cloth. Your heart sinks with theirs. </p> <p>Hans Werner Henze describes a seascape in his score that is not reflected in the old-fashioned staging. His Ondine surely floats on the waves without the need of all-too-human hands to keep her aloft. Almost half a century on, cannot a way be found to unify music and action? </p> <p>Thanks to Andrea Quinn's conducting, dancers and musicians were more in touch than usual on the opening night, even during the difficult last act. The Neapolitan dancers in the wedding divertissement stopped counting the beats and let themselves follow Henze's rhythms. Led by Johan Kobborg and Belinda Hatley, they showed how Ashton's trickiest steps can sparkle afresh. </p> <p>Ditch the designs, chuck the non-dancing extras into the sea and concentrate on the choreography; that way the magic might work.</p>",

Until the Cullberg Ballet from Sweden brought his ballets to the 1999 Edinburgh Festival, Ek's work had only been seen here on television. (Sadler's Wells hopes to present his disturbing version of Swan Lake next year, money permitting). Because Ek's take on the world is so unfamiliar, it is all the more refreshing. In Christopher Bruce's Sergeant Early's Dream (from 1984) on the same programme, the hopes and fears of its cast of Irish immigrants are common currency. Ek's Scandinavian family members are bizarrely unpredictable. She Was Black appears to be set in a cavernous kitchen. A married couple spar, driven by a dual need to torment each other. His hat serves as her pudding bowl, her skirt as his snot-rag. He treats her like a dog; she tries to hump him in sexual frustration. Enter a horde of black and red onlookers, who sit in judgment on them, a jury of children, servants or neighbours, perched on a staircase. These characters then have their own dances, as blunt and vehement as cut-out cartoons. Henryk Gorecki's Second String Quartet veers between ominously sliding harmonies and urgent throbbing. Its nightmare quality is reflected in the appearance of a man gliding on pointe, briefly naked except for his hat and toe-shoes. Maybe he's a fantasy of harmony between the sexes, who are otherwise at each other's throats and groins. Perhaps the Thing is his dream, an enigmatic shape enveloped in a black rubbish bag. It visits itself upon the hapless household, witness ing the guilty secrets that are locked into closets. In the end, the monster has to be acknowledged. No longer despised as garbage, she sloughs off her sack and dances. She has a human form and voice (a recorded throat-music song), though she is still pretty strange. That's fine by Ek - his compassion extends to the low-liest outcast. The Rambert dancers embody his vision with complete conviction. Since they have been coached by the choreographer himself, we are free to make our own interpretations - they know what theirs is. The Royal Ballet has not had that advantage with its recent revivals of works by Antony Tudor and Frederick Ashton, who are both dead. Neither Tudor's Shadowplay nor Ashton's Ondine coheres as a ballet. Yet there are such marvellous moments in both that one longs for the productions to be pulled into shape, reorganised to be seen with new eyes. Shadowplay was coming to life by its last performance on Monday, with Edward Watson as the Boy With Matted Hair (or floppy red locks, in his case). He teetered between gaucheness and elegance. Determined to understand every step of his journey, he took us with him. In an ideal cast, he should be confronted by more formidable seducers than Jane Burn and David Pickering, but at least some alert intelligences were at play. Ondine, last revived on the Sadler's Wells stage when the Royal Ballet was homeless, is better framed in the Opera House. It is a strange mixture of painterly and papier mch\u00e9, both in Lila di Nobili's designs and the dancers' interpretations. Jonathan Cope as the hero, Palemon, reverted to the cardboard cypher he used to be before Sylvie Guillem took him on. Sarah Wildor as the wilful water nymph of the title aroused little response from him, even though she was enchanting. Ondine is supposed to have no soul, which should make her even more alien than Ek's black Thing. But Wildor can't help being a warm-hearted mermaid, full of remorse at the devastation she brings about so unthinkingly. She cradles her drowned lover with genuine emotion, while her fellow sprites sway in the currents around them, looking like ghostly Blake watercolours. Ashton's imagination conjures up images that modern technology ought to be able to realise more effectively than the clapped-out stage machinery he was using in 1958. True, the shipboard scene in Act II is initially a triumph of painted gauzes, but nobody on deck believes in the storm or the invasion of nymphs and tritons, flapping bits of cloth. Your heart sinks with theirs. Hans Werner Henze describes a seascape in his score that is not reflected in the old-fashioned staging. His Ondine surely floats on the waves without the need of all-too-human hands to keep her aloft. Almost half a century on, cannot a way be found to unify music and action? Thanks to Andrea Quinn's conducting, dancers and musicians were more in touch than usual on the opening night, even during the difficult last act. The Neapolitan dancers in the wedding divertissement stopped counting the beats and let themselves follow Henze's rhythms. Led by Johan Kobborg and Belinda Hatley, they showed how Ashton's trickiest steps can sparkle afresh. Ditch the designs, chuck the non-dancing extras into the sea and concentrate on the choreography; that way the magic might work.",

It's a pleasure to witness.

She tells of watching a girl in her home town of Philadelphia - 'little shirt, you could see her breasts, skirt so short that when she walked her butt-cheeks were showing' - and of noticing the youth of this premature sexpot; she bemoans the plethora of playas and hos on TV - 'I'd like to see some options'.

Whether speaking, crooning, scatting, or letting rip like a strange opera singer, Jill Scott's voice is a heavenly wonder. Even those who find her songwriting too syrupy cannot deny Jill Scott's stunning vocal gift. Actually, if the album's love talk does get your cynical goat, then I'd advise just letting it wash over you for a while. A few listens later and certain tracks will lift themselves out of the mix: the single 'Gettin' in the Way'; the funky 'It's Love'; the haunting 'He Loves Me'; the spoken tale of cheeky check-out girls, 'Exclusively'. </p> <p>Tonight, we're treated to four belters in quick succession - 'A Long Walk', 'Love Rains', 'Slowly Surely', 'Gettin' in the Way' - each merging into the next, none sounding exactly as on the album, but funkier, jazzier, more freestyle and immediate.

You walk over black and white diagrams - they're police maps. You halt beside a holding cell to watch Gary Mitchell's play. </p> <p>A man, waiting to be taken to jail, howls as he hangs from the vibrating bars. You overhear a high-voltage exchange with his escort - the prisoner full of bravado, the officer haggard with memories - and follow them, past the cells of silent inmates, with gates shutting behind you, until the prisoner is left alone, and breaks down. </p> <p>In a lofty courtroom, seated behind the glass of the public gallery, you listen to Owen McCaffery's dialogue: a ghostly voice pleads to know who killed him. In Nicola McCartney's Jury Room you see two jurors practising on each other the feats of observation they'll use to convict. You're always passing doors marked 'Toilet', and eventually you're shepherded into the gents: a grimy roller-towel; 'Red is a tout' scrawled on the wall; a bank of cigarette stubs under the basins. In Daragh Carville's drama two men discuss the site's future use, as a tourist information centre. One suggests that the Peace Process poses a difficulty: the Troubles were the city's 'brand'. </p> <p> Convictions knocks you with its immediacy, but also asks what you're doing touristing around. It's an urgent question in Belfast, where there are taxi tours to the Shankill, with its red-white-and-blue kerbstones, its murals of Princess Diana and of fighters in black balaclavas. Horror is turning into heritage - as Convictions makes you see. </p> <p>It's always hard to stage <strong> Peer Gynt</strong>. Ibsen's hero has - it's his point - several selves: playful, guilt-laden, tale-spinning, truth-seeking, sexually adventurous and mother-fixated.

      "body": "<p><strong> Brice Marden</strong> Serpentine Gallery, London W2 until 7 January <br></p> <p><strong> Martin Creed</strong> Camden Arts Centre, London NW3, 14 January <br></p> <p><strong> Simon Starling</strong> Camden Arts Centre, 14 January <br></p> <p>Brice Marden paints beautiful, entrancing abstract pictures that sell for millions in America but haven't been shown here for almost 20 years. This may not seem so odd when you consider that his forefather, Jackson Pollock, only had his belated due at the Tate last year. On the other hand, our museums have been working slowly through Marden's contemporaries: Carl Andre, Frank Stella, Ed Ruscha, Chuck Close. He seems to be the mysterious exception: a quiet American who has never had the limelight in Britain that he deserves. </p> <p>The Serpentine show should change all that. Eighteen big paintings, some of them mural-sized, others scaled to the dimensions of a human figure, are backed up by more than two dozen drawings. Each canvas is a loose tracery of lines unfurling across a painted surface, sometimes rich, sometimes transparent, often scraped back so far that the fabric appears, its grain as soft as time-worn denim. The webs are a bit like Pollock - refined and in slo-mo; the colours often as luminous as Rothko. But there is no Ab-Ex angst, no ego in Marden. Steep yourself in his paintings and you may even discover radiant figures. </p> <p>Ten years ago, at the age of 50, Marden began painting his renowned Cold Mountain series, one of which marks the start of this show. Cold Mountain was not a place but a person, an eighth-century Chinese poet who went to live among Buddhist monks as a retort to the imperial court and its 'world of dust'. Marden liked the words. More than that, he liked the way they were written: dynamic columns of vertical characters. Until this point, he had built his paintings from abutted blocks of monochrome canvas. Crudely put, he now leapt into the free flow of calligraphy, via his inheritance from the previous generation of US painters. </p> <p>If you're thinking of incense and wind-chimes, put aside such notions. Cold Mountain 2 is abidingly restrained and austere. Those old monochromes are still present in the silver-grey light that seems to glimmer behind the tangle of blue and black lines. Marden had already found the tool he has used ever since - a long-handled brush that gave him less control over his line, but more distance to witness the overall effect. As it travels over the surface, criss-crossing in snags and curves, the inky line gestures at craggy mountains in cold air. This is the place - inspired by the poet's brushwork. </p> <p>Since then, a great deal has happened to Marden. He spends half the year in Greece - look at The Muses, a spectacularly energetic canvas, and you may see nine figures in the lithe, Bacchanalian loops. There's something Mediterranean in the drawings, with their dazzling white against terracotta ground. There's even something romantic in these intensely disciplined paintings: the undulating, twining lines of Sisters that abstract a portrait of Marden's daughters; the pale filigree of Virgin , that sends delicate veins of indigo across a new green pasture. </p> <p>It's often said that Marden, like Klee, lets the line take a walk. A slow dance would be much nearer the mark. His brush - and thus your eye - glides round the canvas with voluptuous ease, never running away with itself, never out of hand. All sorts of pleasures occur as one line fuses, caresses or dissolves into another. The ghost of previous layers is there beneath the surface, too, sending out a glow like the red beneath the gold leaf in an icon. How it's made is the essential story of each picture. </p> <p>You get the image gradually, as the lines draw you slow and deep into the web. Only when you've followed all the brilliant blues and reds that ribbon across one canvas does the title - Chinese Dancing - make full sense. In his latest series, The Attendants, Marden's lines have become simpler, broader, stronger in colour. The look is elegant, curvaceous, profoundly abstract, until you notice the bent figures that look a little like Greek caryatids - by which time you will have been relaxed, seduced by the experience of looking. This is Marden, the practised lover of paint: somewhat classical, yet always ultra-modern. </p> <p>There are 18 works in <strong> Martin Creed's</strong> show, too - though it would be surprising if you noticed them all at first glance. Creed likes to make little of nothing very much: a sheet of A4 crumpled into a sphere, a table partially obstructing a door, half the air in a room captured in white balloons, the other half free for all. Some works are entirely described by their titles - 'A door opening and closing'. Others are titles alone, such as the words 'Something in the middle of a wall' printed on A4 and tacked to the middle of a wall. Not quite art, not quite nothing, these are modest proposals reduced to the absurd. </p> <p>Slight, quizzical, discreet, Creed's work makes few claims or demands. A metronome has 39 speeds; wishing to know how they'd sound together he sets one for each speed and creates a rhythmic serial music. A trained painter, he wants to stick something on the wall; not wishing to add more objects to the world, he makes do with Blu-Tack. It's a constant swither between imagined possibilities and self-drawn limitations. </p> <p>I used to think Creed's work was anxious and equivocal - 'Don't Worry' read the flickering neon sign he showed at the Tate. Now I'm not so certain. Once you've noticed other people succeeding where you didn't even try, his obstructed door becomes a cheerful running gag; and the best work here - Love Duet - is unequivocally romantic. It shows a single bar of music in which middle C is scored for both bass and treble clef: perfect accord in a one-note harmony. </p> <p><strong> Simon Starling's </strong>propositions are more lavishly visual. He's showing what looks like a miniature neo-classical palace - but turns out to be a chicken coop - along with some egg coddlers and a primitive oven. There are photographs of a bike ride between two Le Corbusier buildings in France and a slide installation of a car trip from Scotland to Spain to return some rhododendrons to their ancient habitat. </p> <p>To join the dots, to make the smallest sense of this work, I would have to reproduce the gallery's laborious captions verbatim. Starling is very big on the continent, where they have a liking for such textual props. Without them, this art cannot speak for itself: it's just documentary evidence that doesn't add up. </p>",

The look is elegant, curvaceous, profoundly abstract, until you notice the bent figures that look a little like Greek caryatids - by which time you will have been relaxed, seduced by the experience of looking. This is Marden, the practised lover of paint: somewhat classical, yet always ultra-modern. There are 18 works in Martin Creed's show, too - though it would be surprising if you noticed them all at first glance. Creed likes to make little of nothing very much: a sheet of A4 crumpled into a sphere, a table partially obstructing a door, half the air in a room captured in white balloons, the other half free for all. Some works are entirely described by their titles - 'A door opening and closing'. Others are titles alone, such as the words 'Something in the middle of a wall' printed on A4 and tacked to the middle of a wall. Not quite art, not quite nothing, these are modest proposals reduced to the absurd. Slight, quizzical, discreet, Creed's work makes few claims or demands. A metronome has 39 speeds; wishing to know how they'd sound together he sets one for each speed and creates a rhythmic serial music. A trained painter, he wants to stick something on the wall; not wishing to add more objects to the world, he makes do with Blu-Tack. It's a constant swither between imagined possibilities and self-drawn limitations. I used to think Creed's work was anxious and equivocal - 'Don't Worry' read the flickering neon sign he showed at the Tate. Now I'm not so certain. Once you've noticed other people succeeding where you didn't even try, his obstructed door becomes a cheerful running gag; and the best work here - Love Duet - is unequivocally romantic. It shows a single bar of music in which middle C is scored for both bass and treble clef: perfect accord in a one-note harmony. Simon Starling's propositions are more lavishly visual. He's showing what looks like a miniature neo-classical palace - but turns out to be a chicken coop - along with some egg coddlers and a primitive oven. There are photographs of a bike ride between two Le Corbusier buildings in France and a slide installation of a car trip from Scotland to Spain to return some rhododendrons to their ancient habitat. To join the dots, to make the smallest sense of this work, I would have to reproduce the gallery's laborious captions verbatim. Starling is very big on the continent, where they have a liking for such textual props. Without them, this art cannot speak for itself: it's just documentary evidence that doesn't add up.",

      "body": "<p>Inspector Morse ITV</p> <p>State of the Planet BBC1</p> <p>Cold Feet ITV</p> <p>Human Remains BBC2</p> <p>Christie's Story ITV<br></p> <p>Having been shot during the most dismal British summer in living memory, every external scene of the final episode of 'Inspector Morose' was infected by white-out skies, thin, sickly light and recently rained-upon ground, the colours and textures of a series in its death throes. In happier times, Morose's Oxford quads and riverside pubs shimmered under a dreamy, sepia-dapple Brides-headish sun, thus persuading potential tourists that the city boasted it's own gilded microclimate. But now the truth is out: it rains in Oxford, too, so, mark my words, bookings may plummet. Or maybe I just suffer from recovered Morse-memory syndrome, part of the same wonky internal nostalgia that rewrites one's childhood Christmases as perennially snowy winter wonderlands and summers as a three-month heat-haze spent living as Swallows and Amazons.</p> <p> The Remorseful Day was not vintage Morse but it was faithful to the text inasmuch as the book left me feeling that the hero's demise was a blessed release from a desolate retirement with too much Wagner, too many snifters and unsuitable divorc\u00e9es taken before lunch. Faithful, too, in that the central crime was oddly unengaging and the suspects much of a don't-much-care muchness.</p> <p> There are always a few jarring moments in a Morse and this was no exception: the teenage boy Roy, for example (is anybody under 40 called Roy?), and the desperately glamorous Diana Rigg-via-Honor Blackmanish upper-middle-class murder victim who lived in a mansion but, wholly unconvincingly - even if she did have a hands-on bedside manner and a bit of a thing for fetishism - also worked as an NHS nurse, all the better to sleep with paunchy, possibly even pervy, detective inspectors. But at the end of the remorseless day it was only the sadly banal death of Morse we were primed to care about, and the unnerving possibility that his passing leaves Lewis alone in charge of stemming Oxfordshire's bloody tide of a body count. Personally, I think Morse would have been much better off murdered by a schizoid Lewis, recently converted to Wagner and then swiftly promoted before being been given the case to solve. Oh dear, I think I'm going to miss them.</p> <p> Perhaps it is down to the shared physical likeness between the two National Treasures - silvery hair, voices of authority - but I thought I detected a Morse-ishly plaintive swan-song note to Sir David Attenborough's State of the Planet. All the more poignant because he has no obvious successor, either, and thus the prospect of television wildlife continuing to flourish in its natural habitat, the BBC, without Attenborough seems quite remote.</p> <p> The feeling that he has owned his subject for the best part of 50 years was rammed home by the fact that, had it been presented by anyone else, State of the Planet would probably have aired at teatime on a Sunday on BBC2. After all, only Sir David can be entrusted with the awesome responsibility of attempting to enthuse viewers about bacteria and nematode worms (and he didn't), or be allowed to get away with saying 'there are moths, small ones, big ones, beetles, more moths...' without anybody at the BBC imagining that, as a result, a million itchy trigger-fingers might zap elsewhere. </p> <p> On the evidence of its first episode, Attenborough's State of the Planet will prove as unmemorable as the final Morse, but will also be watched respectfully, even devoutly, by those who pine for his Golden Age.</p> <p> And I shouldn't be surprised if State of the Planet is resoundingly beaten in the ratings by ITV's Cold Feet. Now in its third series, popularly described as 'the British answer to Friends' (copyright: every newspaper), this everyday story of variously uncommitted early-thirtysomething professional folk, humorously juggling marriage, divorce, infidelity, babies, work (though not much of that, to be honest) and other predictable life crises inside a selection of top-of-the-range Magnet kitchens is, unfortunately, loathed by me for reasons that are far too petty and personal to count as criticism, but which I will share with you anyway simply because I can. </p> <p> Basically, James Nesbitt, as a lightly comedic, housewife's-choice of a TV Oirishman, just isn't Dylan Moran. Or, to put it bluntly, how are we meant to accept that such a profoundly unattractive physical specimen could ever pull the lovely Helen Baxendale, much less persuade her to stick around and have his babies?</p> <p> But aside from finding Nesbitt unsavoury, more worrying is the fact that the writers pride themselves on tackling issues like infertility and infidelity, only to douse the plots with the cheapest 'scentimentality'. For example, the show's best actress (and most engaging character) is Fay Ripley as Jenny, now being wooed by a dotcomic millionaire. In a scene of toe-curling ghastliness, this thinly veiled cipher of a character bombarded Jenny with flowers (Cold Feet loves flowers: easy visual shorthand to make men look sensitive and women girlishly vulnerable) before turning up on her doorstep, in the rain, to deliver the following: 'I'm a pretty good catch. I'm reliable. I'm affectionate. I am, I'm told, more than averagely good in bed: passionate, courteous, imaginative but not weird or kinky. And I'm clean, which might not sound like much but shouldn't be taken for granted... Whatever happens, Jenny, if you phone me or not, I think you're absolutely spectacular.' This was meant to be cute, of course, but though real men do sometimes resort to tactics like this, (though rarely so archly scripted) they often end up with restraining orders as a result, and quite right too. </p> <p>But Jenny bought it and before long the tragic eunuch returned with a pair of British Airways tickets to New York. Bet Cold Feet's sponsors, United Airlines, loved that.</p> <p> No sentimentality but not quite enough laughs either, in Human Remains, in which Rob Brydon reprised his mild-mannered man-at-the-end-of-his-emotional-tether routine from Marion and Geoff, but with a different class, accent and wardrobe. Brydon's chinless Peter was stuck in a loveless marriage to Julia Davis's terrifying Flick ('at Roedean a little bullying went on, but I don't regret it'), stricken with terminal vaginismus, an eye patch and an undimmed love for her deceased fiance, Geoffrey (no relation to Marion, but buried erect - 'as I like to remember him' - in Flick and Peter's garden). </p> <p> 'If a life of turmoil, anguish, doubt, fear, regret and longing is a bad hand, then, yes, I've been dealt a bad hand. But is it?' pondered Peter. Maybe it was down to the presence of Julia Davis, but Human Remains looked a bit like an extended sketch from Chris Morris's Jam, and you wouldn't want to watch half an hour of that, would you?</p> <p> For several minutes I thought I knew where the ITV documentary, Christie's Story, was headed: it was about a life of turmoil, anguish, doubt, fear, regret and longing. Given a year to live, the twice-divorced 24-year-old American mother of little Olivia decided to undergo dramatic surgery in order to reduce her 36-stone bulk to something she would no longer be afraid to reveal in public, and would turn out to be a predictable tale of triumph over gross adversity. But then we heard Christie's mother, Lynne, at her daughter's hospital bedside, admonishing herself for her own tears:</p> <p> 'Uh-oh, I got that nasty cold in my eyes again!' 'Tears?' asked Olivia. 'Sinuses!' snapped Granny. </p> <p>At which point we knew that something dark and potentially Grand Guignol must have occurred within this family. Subsequently, Christie lost two-thirds of her bodyweight, her mother rejected her, she moved to the projects in a sad Arkansas town and embarked on a self-destructive spiral of drink, drugs and rampant promiscuity. Meanwhile, her formerly slim five- year-old daughter ballooned into an obese seven-year-old and a small American tragedy was turned into a gripping spectacle by Christie's intelligent articulacy but desperate lack of insight. Chillingly, there was also the sense that only regular, confrontational wake-up calls from the TV documentary crew might save her, which made Christie's Story a bit like watching an episode of Jerry Springer directed, in slurred slow-motion, by Chris Morris. Still, you'd be hard-pressed to find anything on TV more compulsive than that.</p>",

The collective of drummers, bassists, woodwind and string players formed in Montreal four years ago, take their name from a Japanese motorbike gang. They perform a widely praised brand of instrumental music that, to their fans, provides an even more extreme version of Kid A, Radiohead's current best-selling album of tuneless pessimism.</p> <p>The band strives to remain anonymous, refusing all interview and photo requests and producing abstract cover art for their records. It is this anonymity which makes their four-night residency at the Scala all the more compelling. More of a sensory 'happening' than a straightforward rock gig, Godspeed live are like watching an unsettling but poignant movie, as the nine-piece band eke out a haunting end-of-the-world soundtrack to the accompaniment of sampled field recordings and disembodied evangelical rants. They'll be dwarfed by an innovative melange of instruments, and back-projected films.</p> <p>Godspeed initially wondered whether making records would cause them to be tainted with what they consider to be the satanic brush of commercialism and radio-friendly marketing. They relented, releasing three albums with titles as impenetrable as the anti-corporate declarations that they send to the music press as promotional material.</p> <p>Their first album, 'all lights fucked on the hairy amp drooling' (1995), was self-released and 'f#a#*' in 1997, was followed this year by the knowing Franglais of 'Levez Vos Skinny Fists Comme Antennas To Heaven'.</p> <p>The latter two contain lengthy, gasp-inducing pieces of classical- and sample-inflected rock. They are hailed as the musical vanguard of the Seattle/Prague anti-capitalist movement due to their support for sustained protest against branding and a work culture in which the profitability of human labour is exploited at the expense of creativity and freedom. It's likely, however, that they'd rather not be hailed at all.</p> <p>\u0095 Godspeed You Black Emperor! is playing at the Scala, 275-277 Pentonville Road, London N1 (020 7833 2022), from tonight. 'Levez Vos Skinny Fists Comme Antennas To Heaven' is available on <a href=\"http://www.cstrecords.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Kranky Records</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Obscure Canadian instrumentalists Godspeed You Black Emperor! unveil their apocalyptic vision in four concerts at the Scala in London this week. The collective of drummers, bassists, woodwind and string players formed in Montreal four years ago, take their name from a Japanese motorbike gang. They perform a widely praised brand of instrumental music that, to their fans, provides an even more extreme version of Kid A, Radiohead's current best-selling album of tuneless pessimism. The band strives to remain anonymous, refusing all interview and photo requests and producing abstract cover art for their records. It is this anonymity which makes their four-night residency at the Scala all the more compelling. More of a sensory 'happening' than a straightforward rock gig, Godspeed live are like watching an unsettling but poignant movie, as the nine-piece band eke out a haunting end-of-the-world soundtrack to the accompaniment of sampled field recordings and disembodied evangelical rants. They'll be dwarfed by an innovative melange of instruments, and back-projected films. Godspeed initially wondered whether making records would cause them to be tainted with what they consider to be the satanic brush of commercialism and radio-friendly marketing. They relented, releasing three albums with titles as impenetrable as the anti-corporate declarations that they send to the music press as promotional material. Their first album, 'all lights fucked on the hairy amp drooling' (1995), was self-released and 'f#a#*' in 1997, was followed this year by the knowing Franglais of 'Levez Vos Skinny Fists Comme Antennas To Heaven'. The latter two contain lengthy, gasp-inducing pieces of classical- and sample-inflected rock. They are hailed as the musical vanguard of the Seattle/Prague anti-capitalist movement due to their support for sustained protest against branding and a work culture in which the profitability of human labour is exploited at the expense of creativity and freedom. It's likely, however, that they'd rather not be hailed at all. \u0095 Godspeed You Black Emperor! is playing at the Scala, 275-277 Pentonville Road, London N1 (020 7833 2022), from tonight. 'Levez Vos Skinny Fists Comme Antennas To Heaven' is available on Kranky Records.",

      "body": "<p>When a magazine fashion editor took a trip to Hong Kong last year, she had to buy an extra suitcase to pack her shopping in. It was a carry-on case, with a padlock bearing the initials LV. A Louis Vuitton case is a bit self-indulgent, you might think. But it cost her just HK$40 - including the padlock. She packed it full of presents and souvenirs she had bought for friends back home. Instead of chopsticks, rice bowls and jade bracelets, however, she overloaded on brand-name, luxury designer goods - fakes, each and every one of them.</p> <p>'I went to the market and it was just full of Louis Vuitton,' she says. 'It's the capital of forgery. There were Vuitton logos everywhere - and they looked so convincing.' When she wasn't sure about the carry-on case, even if it was only HK$40, the stall holder presented a catalogue. If she'd had two weeks to wait, she could have ordered whatever she wanted and had it made specially. She told her friends that the bags - miniature shoulder bags in pearlised baby blue and pink which cost her just HK$30 each, after she'd haggled - were fakes. 'But you would never know!' she boasts. 'It's fun carrying a fake bag. More fool the person who thinks it's a real label. I think there's a smugness about people who only want the real thing. Who cares?' she says.</p> <p>Louis Vuitton for starters. It cares very much that its Monogram canvas, created in 1896 by Georges Vuitton, son of Louis, is common currency on market stalls across the world. It cares so much that when a newspaper journalist was spotted carrying a fake Vuitton bag into one of its shows, she was pounced on by a Vuitton employee. 'Either the bag stays outside, or you go out with it,' he told her. It was the ultimate humiliation. But it could have happened to a handful of other press and buyers taking their seats ready for the show to begin. Our Hong Kong shopaholic says she would have been 'mortified' if it had happened to her, but adds: 'They are fashion fascists. You should be able to go to a fashion show with whatever bag you choose - a Safeway bag if you want.'</p> <p>But while the style police might have a few disapproving comments about a supermarket carrier, Louis Vuitton's trademark protection would take a harder view. Nathalie Moulle-Berteaux, head of Louis Vuitton's trademarks and designs department, says, 'We cannot do anything. It's private property. What we can do is try to talk about the genuine products to let the fashion journalist know if she thinks it's a joke, it's not a very good joke.'</p> <p>The world has gone logo crazy. We think the 80s were a decade of conspicuous consumption, but 20 years on, brand names have become a religion, with devotees who will not waiver from the path of their chosen famous name, be it Sony, Nike or Fendi. The brand name has become more important than the product itself. Fashion houses from Burberry to Dior have sprinkled their logos so liberally that the clothes themselves cease to matter. And while those who can afford it will only buy the genuine article, most of us are happy to buy into the club via the back door. By marketing logo before product, companies have created a a phenomenal demand for branded goods. If you can get away with wearing a fake, why not?</p> <p>Six-hundred miles away from the luxury fashion and leather houses of Milan, 300 miles away from the designer shops of Paris, Europe has its very own counterfeit capital. It's not in Poland, or even Turkey or Portugal, where many fakes originate. The counterfeit capital of Europe is Leicester. Our textiles industry is excelling at something after all. John Fox, principle trading standards officer for Leicester city council, carries out about 15 factory raids a year. 'To say that Leicester is the clothing counterfeiting capital of Europe is not an overstatement,' he says. 'The labels we seized last year were found in different factories on different days, but when we do our raids, we're only getting a week's product in a 48-week year. It's just the tip of the iceberg. Some just start up again the next day. We can't raid everybody every day of the week.' The maximum penalty for a factory owner is a fine, and a prison sentence of up to 10 years for the company director. The longest sentence a director has had to serve is 12 months.</p> <p>Less than two months ago, the ACG carried out a raid on a factory in Leicester. 'We've raided factories where legitimate product is being manufactured next to illegitimate,' says Glyn Roberts, chairman of the Anti-Counterfeiting Group for Clothing and Footwear and a UK expert on faked clothing. 'We could take you to four or five places in Leicester where they are producing counterfeit goods.' They could also show me the counterfeiter with a personal fortune of \u00a350m, or the 'chap in the Midlands who has not worked legitimately since 1995, but who owns four houses and a couple of Porsches.' But, of course, the men at the top make sure they are untouchable.</p> <p>According to John Anderson, executive secretary of the Anti-Counterfeiting Group, up to 11 per cent of clothing and footwear in circulation are fakes, and 52 per cent of shoppers admit they would buy fake goods. 'Shoppers need to be wary. Counterfeits are becoming more and more convincing and not only does the money go on to fund more dubious activities, items purchased are not made to the same safety specifications as the real thing and there is no compensation if anything goes wrong.'</p> <p>It is the quality as much as the quantity that is worrying the brand owners. 'Over the past two to three years, there has been an explosion of high-quality product on to the market,' says Roberts. 'The quality of the product is superb.'</p> <p>Counterfeiters are entrepreneurs in their own right. Forgery is a warped form of flattery. If a counterfeiter goes to the effort of faking a particular brand's product, it is a sure sign that the brand itself is pressing the right buttons. Tommy Hilfiger's loyal customers spent almost $2bn on the authentic product last year. Not surprisingly, that spells dollars for the counterfeiters, too. They will find out which brands are selling well, and which particular products, and spread their production lines accordingly. They do not restrict themselves to one label either. Jim Bucock, ex-fraud squad, who now works for a major high-street brand which is a member of the ACG, was on the most recent Leicester raid. 'We found several thousand garments which would have been just one week's work,' he says. 'There were half a dozen well-known international brands.'</p> <p>This is an international business, but the Trading Standards officers who work with the ACG can only operate within their own particular patch. Last year alone, 500,000 fake brand labels - from Tommy Hilfiger to Kickers - were seized from Leicester factories. Some of them have been loaned to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum for their Brand.New exhibition on condition that they are destroyed straight after. The disposal of the labels - which are themselves currency on the black market - is something of a headache for the city council itself.</p> <p>They can't be incinerated because the council has an anti-incineration policy. Instead, they have a controlled burial. The 62,000 garments confiscated in the same year were sent to charities to be debranded ('you can take Versace studs and leather patches off jeans and put plain ones back on,' explains John Fox) or, with the brand-owner's permission, useful garments, such as fleeces and sweatshirts, are sent to countries in need, like Romania and Kosovo. Otherwise, the garments are shredded and recycled as green waste, to be used as filling for continental quilts. 'It would be disastrous to throw away pieces of clothing that are otherwise serviceable items,' says Fox.</p> <p>Leicester city council has been taking action with factory raids over the past two-and-a-half years. The forgery business is a relatively new phenomenon. 'It's grown up in the 90s,' says Fox. 'Consumers have become far more brand aware - it's brands and logos that people want. It's the demand that feeds the production. Any logo is a doddle to fake because nearly everything can be copied or scanned electronically.' Often it's as simple as copying a floppy disc with an embroidery programme or a screen print on it. 'There is nothing that can't be copied,' says Fox. 'Computer technology and the demand for brands have grown up side by side.'</p> <p>When he first started out in trading standards at the beginning of the 90s, Fox recalls that the fakes were crude. But 21st-century fakes are such good quality that even experienced officers like himself can't tell the difference. 'The quality of embroidery in particular is so good that we have to bring clothing experts along on raids to see if goods are real,' he says. If the Bank of England has to reissue a new design, anti-counterfeit \u00a310 note, as it did two weeks ago, it is a measure of just how sophisticated the forgery business has become.</p> <p>The fashion brands themselves try to do all they can to make their goods - and their labels and swing tickets - counterfeit-proof. Fila shoes have an anti-counterfeit label hidden under the tongue of the shoe. Three years ago, Dolce e Gabbana introduced a hologram system to its collections. 'The security hologram comes with an authenticity certificate and with a label attached to the outfit,' says a spokesperson for the company. 'It has considerably reduced the production of counterfeited goods since it is quite difficult to reproduce.'</p> <p>But it has not stopped the counterfeiters altogether. For Dolce e Gabbana, the problem is mainly with its more mass-production, younger line, D&amp;G, with fake goods originating in the Far East - everywhere from Taiwan, South Korea, China, Indonesia, and Malaysia to the Philippines. Production has also spread closer to home in Italy, with counterfeit goods, most often T-shirts, caps, jeans, and sunglasses, being made in Tuscany and Campania. Like the UK experts, they too are finding that the fake goods are becoming increasingly convincing. The company employs one member of staff full-time, as well as a team of legal consultants to deal with counterfeit goods and trademark infringement. And although the hologram label has been a success, it is finding that it too can be reproduced - especially in China.</p> <p>You no longer have to travel to exotic Far Eastern destinations to stock up on fake handbags and watches. You don't even have to go as far as your local street market. Simply log on to your favourite search engine and type in the designer or brand name of your choice. New technology is not just making the act of copying easier and quicker, it is also giving counterfeiters the perfect shop window to sell their goods; the internet is the counterfeiter's dream. Online sales of beauty products alone have huge growth potential, with sales projected at around $525m by 2004. Any counterfeiter worth his gold Rolex will want a slice of that.</p> <p>For a wide choice of brand names, the American website, <a href=\"http://www.fashionbrokers.com\" target=\"_NEW\">fashionbrokers.com</a> is an entire virtual department store. 'We are a team of experienced and passionate professionals who believe that trends in fashion are too expensive and transitory to warrant paying an excessive amount of money for them,' reads the company's manifesto. It's also created AnyKnockOff.com 'to allow you to ride the trends, whatever your budget, because you get more value for your money. We are committed to quickly identifying and producing quality knockoffs for the most current lifestyle.' And sure enough, there are Louis Vuitton look-a-like bags galore - a baby blue pearlised shopper on sale for $47 (compared with $900) or a Gucci bamboo-handle fake bag for $44 as opposed to the real thing for $800. There is look-a-like Fendi, Prada, and Christian Dior. It's like a parallel universe Bond Street bargain basement. They don't even pretend to be the real thing, but know that shoppers will revel in the idea of buying into the brand-name culture they would never normally be able to afford.</p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum, there's the Danita's Boutique. Chanel does not sell any product on the internet. But Danita claims to have a small range of 'genuine' bags and accessories from the luxury fashion house - and all at prices not dissimilar to the real thing. 'All of our handbags, clothing and accessories are authentic - and come with a money-back guarantee on authenticity,' claims Danita. Scroll down the site and you will be offered 'a once-in-a-lifetime find - at such a fabulous saving - your new Chanel beauty still boasts your Chanel tag - reflecting a retail of $1,160. Your handbag will arrive in your Chanel box (upon request) along with your Chanel card of authenticity (which matches your serial number inside) and your Chanel care instructions. Absolutely breathtaking!' Danita's price? A not so breathtaking $929.99, begging the question, why not just spend the extra $200 and buy one full price at a Chanel boutique or department store?</p> <p>The irony is that designer logos are also being misappropriated and customised by other designers. Burberry was forced to issue a statement this year, warning of the dangers of using its trademark print after a spate of appearances on the catwalks from London to New York. Super-cred streetwear label Stussy uses its own version of Louis Vuittons monogram as a print in its own range. The limited edition Stussy hat, which uses the monogram, customised with its own logo (which in turn is a bastardisation of the Chanel crossed Cs) and tiny repeats of a graphic of a record deck, has become a cult item. You would be forgiven for thinking it was Louis Vuitton.</p> <p>According to Michael Kopelman who has been instrumental in bringing Stussy to the UK at his London store, Hideout, the Louis Vuitton logo first appeared on Stussy wear around 1988. 'It comes from the Hip Hop community's appropriation of the ghetto fabulous/superstar look,' he says. Louis Vuitton's collection for spring/summer 2001 has stolen back from the Stussy street culture with graffiti splashed across its classic luggage. Vuitton's designer, Marc Jacobs, knows his stuff. But Kopelman is cynical.</p> <p>'Marc Jacobs does see street things living in NYC, but Louis Vuitton is still gear for middle-aged to old ladies and over-accessorised businessmen. It's ironic if Louis Vuitton is using graffiti - they are a very square company with no real connections to this culture.'</p> <p>So, a cool logo is not necessarily the key to credibility. In fashion circles branding and logos have become such common currency, they have become positively naff. For the past two or three seasons, fashion houses, including Gucci, Dior, Chanel, Celine and Fendi have made clothes and accessories so laden with logos that they have become parodies of themselves. For spring/summer 2000, the young American designer in Paris, Jeremy Scott, went so far as to appropriate cheap souvenir logos - the sort of thing you see on T-shirts in tourist shops on the Rue de Rivoli - and make them into an ironic statement about the high-fashion obsession with the logo. He even used them badly, as a counterfeiter might - misspelling Paris, or printing it back to front. To some extent, the fashion houses only have themselves to blame for the massive public demand for logos. Instead of creating new ideas and trends, they have simply made their clothes into wearable advertising hoardings. It makes the counterfeiters' job all too easy.</p> <p>A \u00a3600 Fendi bag is still desirable - but only if you trash the thing before you are seen out with it on your shoulder. Branded goods are seen as being just too obvious. One stylist painted hers red - a bit like when you were at school and covered your pencil case with white Tippex to match your nails. It's all about taking a big brand and then customising it to show you really don't give a damn. If you're Kate Moss and don't like to get your hands dirty, you simply call upon the wayward talents of JJ Hudson, also known as Noki. For a fee, he will customise your Chanel jeans, your Gucci handbag, or your Nike T-shirt. His one-off line of custom art T-shirts sells at the Pineal Eye in West Soho. For the Brand.New exhibition, he has lent three pieces for display, including a ripped, shredded and graffitied Reebok T-shirt, as worn by Mel C for a cover of Q magazine last year. Underneath it is a pair of shoes, which are a bizarre hybrid of court shoe and Adidas trainer. He has a healthy disregard for brand names and logos while at the same time further elevating their cult status. 'I've been their billboard,' he says. 'Now they can be mine.'</p> <p>Hudson doesn't care if the product he customises is fake or real. He hunts down T-shirts in secondhand shops, and says he has come across every fake going, including Reebok, Adidas and Nike. 'I think they're brilliant. Fakes give everybody a chance to have something they might not otherwise be able to afford. There's sometimes more cachet in the fake than the real thing,' he says. It's all part of his irreverent attitude. ' It's a piss-take. You're getting back at the whole desirability that the big brands create by making people constantly try to keep up with new stuff all the time. What I'm doing cuts right through that.' Like vandalising a Chanel logo, making it read Anel Pis. 'Rules are there to broken. I love fakes. It's fun to find a fake in a secondhand shop and customise that - I always write on the back 'fake' or rip-off.' It's an added bonus.</p> <p>And for the logo-obsessed consumer, the fact that fake goods are becoming such good quality will come as great news. It seems as though even legitimate brands use child labour and sweat shops, so buying a fake isn't such a weight on their consciences. In some cases, the counterfeit goods simply show up the genuine article as being over-priced. As one visitor to the Victoria &amp; Albert's Brand.New exhibition commented: 'What's in a brand? Buy the fake and enjoy.' But for Lottie Child, actively campaigning for the anti-consumerist Buy Nothing Day 2000, which will take place next Saturday, fakes and genuine brands are both as bad as each other. 'I think all fashion is fake. I don't make a distinction,' says Child. Both are a symbol of the ever-increasing consumerism that dominates our society. Her one concern however, is her fear that 'the producers of \"fake fashion\" can get away with exploiting their workers and using sweat shop labour.' 'On Buy Nothing Day, buy nothing,' advises Child. 'Decide how you want to spend your day, enjoying yourself without spending money.' And for one day at least, the fakers and the brand owners will both be perceived as the bogeymen.</p> <p>\u0095 Brand.new is at the V&amp;A Museum, South Kensington, London SW7 until 14 January 2001; <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.vam.ac.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "When a magazine fashion editor took a trip to Hong Kong last year, she had to buy an extra suitcase to pack her shopping in. It was a carry-on case, with a padlock bearing the initials LV. A Louis Vuitton case is a bit self-indulgent, you might think. But it cost her just HK$40 - including the padlock. She packed it full of presents and souvenirs she had bought for friends back home. Instead of chopsticks, rice bowls and jade bracelets, however, she overloaded on brand-name, luxury designer goods - fakes, each and every one of them. 'I went to the market and it was just full of Louis Vuitton,' she says. 'It's the capital of forgery. There were Vuitton logos everywhere - and they looked so convincing.' When she wasn't sure about the carry-on case, even if it was only HK$40, the stall holder presented a catalogue. If she'd had two weeks to wait, she could have ordered whatever she wanted and had it made specially. She told her friends that the bags - miniature shoulder bags in pearlised baby blue and pink which cost her just HK$30 each, after she'd haggled - were fakes. 'But you would never know!' she boasts. 'It's fun carrying a fake bag. More fool the person who thinks it's a real label. I think there's a smugness about people who only want the real thing. Who cares?' she says. Louis Vuitton for starters. It cares very much that its Monogram canvas, created in 1896 by Georges Vuitton, son of Louis, is common currency on market stalls across the world. It cares so much that when a newspaper journalist was spotted carrying a fake Vuitton bag into one of its shows, she was pounced on by a Vuitton employee. 'Either the bag stays outside, or you go out with it,' he told her. It was the ultimate humiliation. But it could have happened to a handful of other press and buyers taking their seats ready for the show to begin. Our Hong Kong shopaholic says she would have been 'mortified' if it had happened to her, but adds: 'They are fashion fascists. You should be able to go to a fashion show with whatever bag you choose - a Safeway bag if you want.' But while the style police might have a few disapproving comments about a supermarket carrier, Louis Vuitton's trademark protection would take a harder view. Nathalie Moulle-Berteaux, head of Louis Vuitton's trademarks and designs department, says, 'We cannot do anything. It's private property. What we can do is try to talk about the genuine products to let the fashion journalist know if she thinks it's a joke, it's not a very good joke.' The world has gone logo crazy. We think the 80s were a decade of conspicuous consumption, but 20 years on, brand names have become a religion, with devotees who will not waiver from the path of their chosen famous name, be it Sony, Nike or Fendi. The brand name has become more important than the product itself. Fashion houses from Burberry to Dior have sprinkled their logos so liberally that the clothes themselves cease to matter. And while those who can afford it will only buy the genuine article, most of us are happy to buy into the club via the back door. By marketing logo before product, companies have created a a phenomenal demand for branded goods. If you can get away with wearing a fake, why not? Six-hundred miles away from the luxury fashion and leather houses of Milan, 300 miles away from the designer shops of Paris, Europe has its very own counterfeit capital. It's not in Poland, or even Turkey or Portugal, where many fakes originate. The counterfeit capital of Europe is Leicester. Our textiles industry is excelling at something after all. John Fox, principle trading standards officer for Leicester city council, carries out about 15 factory raids a year. 'To say that Leicester is the clothing counterfeiting capital of Europe is not an overstatement,' he says. 'The labels we seized last year were found in different factories on different days, but when we do our raids, we're only getting a week's product in a 48-week year. It's just the tip of the iceberg. Some just start up again the next day. We can't raid everybody every day of the week.' The maximum penalty for a factory owner is a fine, and a prison sentence of up to 10 years for the company director. The longest sentence a director has had to serve is 12 months. Less than two months ago, the ACG carried out a raid on a factory in Leicester. 'We've raided factories where legitimate product is being manufactured next to illegitimate,' says Glyn Roberts, chairman of the Anti-Counterfeiting Group for Clothing and Footwear and a UK expert on faked clothing. 'We could take you to four or five places in Leicester where they are producing counterfeit goods.' They could also show me the counterfeiter with a personal fortune of \u00a350m, or the 'chap in the Midlands who has not worked legitimately since 1995, but who owns four houses and a couple of Porsches.' But, of course, the men at the top make sure they are untouchable. According to John Anderson, executive secretary of the Anti-Counterfeiting Group, up to 11 per cent of clothing and footwear in circulation are fakes, and 52 per cent of shoppers admit they would buy fake goods. 'Shoppers need to be wary. Counterfeits are becoming more and more convincing and not only does the money go on to fund more dubious activities, items purchased are not made to the same safety specifications as the real thing and there is no compensation if anything goes wrong.' It is the quality as much as the quantity that is worrying the brand owners. 'Over the past two to three years, there has been an explosion of high-quality product on to the market,' says Roberts. 'The quality of the product is superb.' Counterfeiters are entrepreneurs in their own right. Forgery is a warped form of flattery. If a counterfeiter goes to the effort of faking a particular brand's product, it is a sure sign that the brand itself is pressing the right buttons. Tommy Hilfiger's loyal customers spent almost $2bn on the authentic product last year. Not surprisingly, that spells dollars for the counterfeiters, too. They will find out which brands are selling well, and which particular products, and spread their production lines accordingly. They do not restrict themselves to one label either. Jim Bucock, ex-fraud squad, who now works for a major high-street brand which is a member of the ACG, was on the most recent Leicester raid. 'We found several thousand garments which would have been just one week's work,' he says. 'There were half a dozen well-known international brands.' This is an international business, but the Trading Standards officers who work with the ACG can only operate within their own particular patch. Last year alone, 500,000 fake brand labels - from Tommy Hilfiger to Kickers - were seized from Leicester factories. Some of them have been loaned to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum for their Brand.New exhibition on condition that they are destroyed straight after. The disposal of the labels - which are themselves currency on the black market - is something of a headache for the city council itself. They can't be incinerated because the council has an anti-incineration policy. Instead, they have a controlled burial. The 62,000 garments confiscated in the same year were sent to charities to be debranded ('you can take Versace studs and leather patches off jeans and put plain ones back on,' explains John Fox) or, with the brand-owner's permission, useful garments, such as fleeces and sweatshirts, are sent to countries in need, like Romania and Kosovo. Otherwise, the garments are shredded and recycled as green waste, to be used as filling for continental quilts. 'It would be disastrous to throw away pieces of clothing that are otherwise serviceable items,' says Fox. Leicester city council has been taking action with factory raids over the past two-and-a-half years. The forgery business is a relatively new phenomenon. 'It's grown up in the 90s,' says Fox. 'Consumers have become far more brand aware - it's brands and logos that people want. It's the demand that feeds the production. Any logo is a doddle to fake because nearly everything can be copied or scanned electronically.' Often it's as simple as copying a floppy disc with an embroidery programme or a screen print on it. 'There is nothing that can't be copied,' says Fox. 'Computer technology and the demand for brands have grown up side by side.' When he first started out in trading standards at the beginning of the 90s, Fox recalls that the fakes were crude. But 21st-century fakes are such good quality that even experienced officers like himself can't tell the difference. 'The quality of embroidery in particular is so good that we have to bring clothing experts along on raids to see if goods are real,' he says. If the Bank of England has to reissue a new design, anti-counterfeit \u00a310 note, as it did two weeks ago, it is a measure of just how sophisticated the forgery business has become. The fashion brands themselves try to do all they can to make their goods - and their labels and swing tickets - counterfeit-proof. Fila shoes have an anti-counterfeit label hidden under the tongue of the shoe. Three years ago, Dolce e Gabbana introduced a hologram system to its collections. 'The security hologram comes with an authenticity certificate and with a label attached to the outfit,' says a spokesperson for the company. 'It has considerably reduced the production of counterfeited goods since it is quite difficult to reproduce.' But it has not stopped the counterfeiters altogether. For Dolce e Gabbana, the problem is mainly with its more mass-production, younger line, D&amp;G, with fake goods originating in the Far East - everywhere from Taiwan, South Korea, China, Indonesia, and Malaysia to the Philippines. Production has also spread closer to home in Italy, with counterfeit goods, most often T-shirts, caps, jeans, and sunglasses, being made in Tuscany and Campania. Like the UK experts, they too are finding that the fake goods are becoming increasingly convincing. The company employs one member of staff full-time, as well as a team of legal consultants to deal with counterfeit goods and trademark infringement. And although the hologram label has been a success, it is finding that it too can be reproduced - especially in China. You no longer have to travel to exotic Far Eastern destinations to stock up on fake handbags and watches. You don't even have to go as far as your local street market. Simply log on to your favourite search engine and type in the designer or brand name of your choice. New technology is not just making the act of copying easier and quicker, it is also giving counterfeiters the perfect shop window to sell their goods; the internet is the counterfeiter's dream. Online sales of beauty products alone have huge growth potential, with sales projected at around $525m by 2004. Any counterfeiter worth his gold Rolex will want a slice of that. For a wide choice of brand names, the American website, fashionbrokers.com is an entire virtual department store. 'We are a team of experienced and passionate professionals who believe that trends in fashion are too expensive and transitory to warrant paying an excessive amount of money for them,' reads the company's manifesto. It's also created AnyKnockOff.com 'to allow you to ride the trends, whatever your budget, because you get more value for your money. We are committed to quickly identifying and producing quality knockoffs for the most current lifestyle.' And sure enough, there are Louis Vuitton look-a-like bags galore - a baby blue pearlised shopper on sale for $47 (compared with $900) or a Gucci bamboo-handle fake bag for $44 as opposed to the real thing for $800. There is look-a-like Fendi, Prada, and Christian Dior. It's like a parallel universe Bond Street bargain basement. They don't even pretend to be the real thing, but know that shoppers will revel in the idea of buying into the brand-name culture they would never normally be able to afford. At the other end of the spectrum, there's the Danita's Boutique. Chanel does not sell any product on the internet. But Danita claims to have a small range of 'genuine' bags and accessories from the luxury fashion house - and all at prices not dissimilar to the real thing. 'All of our handbags, clothing and accessories are authentic - and come with a money-back guarantee on authenticity,' claims Danita. Scroll down the site and you will be offered 'a once-in-a-lifetime find - at such a fabulous saving - your new Chanel beauty still boasts your Chanel tag - reflecting a retail of $1,160. Your handbag will arrive in your Chanel box (upon request) along with your Chanel card of authenticity (which matches your serial number inside) and your Chanel care instructions. Absolutely breathtaking!' Danita's price? A not so breathtaking $929.99, begging the question, why not just spend the extra $200 and buy one full price at a Chanel boutique or department store? The irony is that designer logos are also being misappropriated and customised by other designers. Burberry was forced to issue a statement this year, warning of the dangers of using its trademark print after a spate of appearances on the catwalks from London to New York. Super-cred streetwear label Stussy uses its own version of Louis Vuittons monogram as a print in its own range. The limited edition Stussy hat, which uses the monogram, customised with its own logo (which in turn is a bastardisation of the Chanel crossed Cs) and tiny repeats of a graphic of a record deck, has become a cult item. You would be forgiven for thinking it was Louis Vuitton. According to Michael Kopelman who has been instrumental in bringing Stussy to the UK at his London store, Hideout, the Louis Vuitton logo first appeared on Stussy wear around 1988. 'It comes from the Hip Hop community's appropriation of the ghetto fabulous/superstar look,' he says. Louis Vuitton's collection for spring/summer 2001 has stolen back from the Stussy street culture with graffiti splashed across its classic luggage. Vuitton's designer, Marc Jacobs, knows his stuff. But Kopelman is cynical. 'Marc Jacobs does see street things living in NYC, but Louis Vuitton is still gear for middle-aged to old ladies and over-accessorised businessmen. It's ironic if Louis Vuitton is using graffiti - they are a very square company with no real connections to this culture.' So, a cool logo is not necessarily the key to credibility. In fashion circles branding and logos have become such common currency, they have become positively naff. For the past two or three seasons, fashion houses, including Gucci, Dior, Chanel, Celine and Fendi have made clothes and accessories so laden with logos that they have become parodies of themselves. For spring/summer 2000, the young American designer in Paris, Jeremy Scott, went so far as to appropriate cheap souvenir logos - the sort of thing you see on T-shirts in tourist shops on the Rue de Rivoli - and make them into an ironic statement about the high-fashion obsession with the logo. He even used them badly, as a counterfeiter might - misspelling Paris, or printing it back to front. To some extent, the fashion houses only have themselves to blame for the massive public demand for logos. Instead of creating new ideas and trends, they have simply made their clothes into wearable advertising hoardings. It makes the counterfeiters' job all too easy. A \u00a3600 Fendi bag is still desirable - but only if you trash the thing before you are seen out with it on your shoulder. Branded goods are seen as being just too obvious. One stylist painted hers red - a bit like when you were at school and covered your pencil case with white Tippex to match your nails.

'Haven't you already got a pair?' my partner asked cautiously, just in case he'd got his fabrics mixed. He was right, however. I do have a pair of PVC jeans. The trousers I was going shopping for weren't for me. 'They're for the baby!' I announced.</p> <p>Now, anyone who wasn't aware that you can now get PVC trousers (black, of course) for babies has clearly never paid a visit to Baby Gap. In this case, they won't have seen the tiny black leather jacket either. Yes, I've got that too, although the zip sticks a bit, especially when I've got the oatmeal cashmere hooded top underneath. Also, the collar rides up. If I don't keep tugging it down, he looks less like a miniature James Dean than Uncle Fester. I tell everyone that the PVC and leather are not fashion statements. 'They're terribly practical, wipe clean,' I say. But I'm lying. My child is a fashion victim, and it's all my fault.</p> <p>I have become a casualty, or rather my son has, of the Mini Me syndrome. This is where new parents are gripped by the desire to tog their kids up in ludicrously expensive versions of adult clothing. There's the Hennes kids department and any number of designer-label kids' ranges, notably Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger. Then there's the Mini Boden and Little Badger catalogues. You see, you don't even have to leave home to make your offspring look totally ridiculous.</p> <p>I am not proud of what I am doing to my child. Every time I put my jean-jacketed baby into my three-wheeled pram and push him down the street, I see other parents pushing their denim-wearing offspring in similar vehicles and I want to throw up. We are raising a generation of overdressed clones. I have to admit that I bonded with another mother at my Baby Massage class on the strength of her Gap changing bag, the same as mine. When I go to my postnatal appointments I know there will always be at least one other baby in dungarees.</p> <p>I didn't start out wanting to make a spectacle of my child. 'You're not going to dress the baby in little adult clothes are you?' I remember someone asking me before the birth. 'Oh no,' I replied in an appalled tone. And at first I did quite well. I put Griffin in plain white babygrows, just like Meg Mathews said she was going to do with her baby Anais. By the way, did you see the most recent snap of the soon-to-be-ex Mrs Gallagher and child? Out have gone the babygrows. In have come pink marabou deely boppers. Not very minimalist.</p> <p>The ultimate Mini Me Baby is Posh and Becks' little human accessory, Brooklyn. If there is a miniature version of an adult-sized designer label, he will have it. There is now also a TV version, Baby David on The Royle Family . I took one look at his suede fringed jacket and cringed. There, but for a different sort of cow hide, go I.</p> <p>So why do I and so many other mothers do it? Well, for a start, this isn't all women's work. Some of the most enthusiastic consumers of Mini Me clothing are men. The days when it was only girls who were born to shop are now gone. Many chaps now actually enjoy looking at clothes, except they feel a bit silly buying frilly things for a baby. Still, give them a sheepskin gilet and a pair of tweeny weeny Timberlands and there's no holding them back.</p> <p>When women do the buying, there are darker motives at work. If the baby is a girl, there is a lot of wish-fulfillment going on. For all those women brought up in the 70s when feminist mothers didn't exactly rush out to buy Snow White costumes, having a baby of your own is chance to indulge. If the baby is a boy, it's revenge. After 20 years spent surreptitiously struggling with successive boyfriends' clothing, this is my chance to dress a man exactly as I want, with no argument, sulking or having to offer sexual favours.</p> <p>There are other factors. Dual-income couples having children later have more money to spend. If you're accustomed to spending three grand on a Conran sofa, 20 quid for a Baby Gap denim jacket doesn't seem so bad. Add in sleep deprivation and hormones doing the hokey cokey, and it's a wonder more babies aren't dressed in the silver padded spacesuit my sister just brought back for Griffin from Washington. (If you really want to play the label game, US Baby Gap trumps UK Baby Gap every time.)</p> <p>It is no accident that I brought Griffin's first Mini Me outfit on a shopping trip two weeks after the birth when I was supposed to be buying clothes for myself. I couldn't get one leg in a Kooka\u00ef size 14 and was so depressed I was almost forced to jog to Hennes kids' department. Until you've shifted the pregnancy flab, the only decent shopping therapy available is babywear.</p> <p>The result of all this is that getting Griffin dressed is a nightmare of fiddling with tiny buttons and zips. Then I have to decide whether to do a bib or not. Mothercare terry towelling hardly sits well with PVC, but if I decide to chance it, you can bet he will throw up all over his carefully coordinated outfit. When I leave him with Mercedes, our cleaner, she puts him into a T-shirt and jersey leggings that don't match. I think this is a hint. As my mother, who can't get her head round the PVC at all, says: 'He'd be so much happier in a babygrow.' Yes, but would I?</p>",

I put Griffin in plain white babygrows, just like Meg Mathews said she was going to do with her baby Anais. By the way, did you see the most recent snap of the soon-to-be-ex Mrs Gallagher and child? Out have gone the babygrows. In have come pink marabou deely boppers. Not very minimalist. The ultimate Mini Me Baby is Posh and Becks' little human accessory, Brooklyn. If there is a miniature version of an adult-sized designer label, he will have it. There is now also a TV version, Baby David on The Royle Family . I took one look at his suede fringed jacket and cringed. There, but for a different sort of cow hide, go I. So why do I and so many other mothers do it? Well, for a start, this isn't all women's work. Some of the most enthusiastic consumers of Mini Me clothing are men. The days when it was only girls who were born to shop are now gone. Many chaps now actually enjoy looking at clothes, except they feel a bit silly buying frilly things for a baby. Still, give them a sheepskin gilet and a pair of tweeny weeny Timberlands and there's no holding them back. When women do the buying, there are darker motives at work. If the baby is a girl, there is a lot of wish-fulfillment going on. For all those women brought up in the 70s when feminist mothers didn't exactly rush out to buy Snow White costumes, having a baby of your own is chance to indulge. If the baby is a boy, it's revenge. After 20 years spent surreptitiously struggling with successive boyfriends' clothing, this is my chance to dress a man exactly as I want, with no argument, sulking or having to offer sexual favours. There are other factors. Dual-income couples having children later have more money to spend. If you're accustomed to spending three grand on a Conran sofa, 20 quid for a Baby Gap denim jacket doesn't seem so bad. Add in sleep deprivation and hormones doing the hokey cokey, and it's a wonder more babies aren't dressed in the silver padded spacesuit my sister just brought back for Griffin from Washington. (If you really want to play the label game, US Baby Gap trumps UK Baby Gap every time.) It is no accident that I brought Griffin's first Mini Me outfit on a shopping trip two weeks after the birth when I was supposed to be buying clothes for myself. I couldn't get one leg in a Kooka\u00ef size 14 and was so depressed I was almost forced to jog to Hennes kids' department. Until you've shifted the pregnancy flab, the only decent shopping therapy available is babywear. The result of all this is that getting Griffin dressed is a nightmare of fiddling with tiny buttons and zips. Then I have to decide whether to do a bib or not. Mothercare terry towelling hardly sits well with PVC, but if I decide to chance it, you can bet he will throw up all over his carefully coordinated outfit. When I leave him with Mercedes, our cleaner, she puts him into a T-shirt and jersey leggings that don't match. I think this is a hint. As my mother, who can't get her head round the PVC at all, says: 'He'd be so much happier in a babygrow.' Yes, but would I?",

      "body": "<p>Insomnia hit me overnight and fast became an inadvertent hobby. Getting the better of it is not an exact science, and even now, a year down the line, I haven't shaken the habit completely. It is cold comfort that, as I've variously read, 50 per cent of the population is currently in 'sleep deficit', that 90 per cent will have insomnia at some point, that one in three is likely to experience chronic insomnia. Along with the numbers, prevailing wisdom varies wildly: one school of thought has it that adults need anywhere from three to 11 hours of sleep, depending on the individual, another maintains that seven to eight is optimal. There are always sliding scales; there are no hard and fast rules. </p> <p>In the initial throes of sleep disruption, before my insomnia became chronic, I read with some foreboding the testimonials on the internet: it's been three months; six months; years. Mine is a singular case, I told myself - I'll combat this in no time. And so I went about testing the waters of different approaches. </p> <p>A year ago. A crisis at work. I go home late, have dinner at 10pm, am fast asleep by 11.30pm. Suddenly the clock reads 2am, and I'm bolt-upright awake, riveted, lucid, heart surging into overdrive. Aiming to relax, trying not to think, I end up racing through a back catalogue of scenarios. After an hour or so, I slide into light sleep, only skimming the surface, then blast awake again at 4.30am, my blood pressure vertiginous. I wrestle with runaway thoughts, then around 6.45am I fall into deep, restorative rest for all of 45 minutes. Am I out of my mind? It's a question of beating myself at my own game, trying to get away with racking up as many consecutive hours of sleep as possible. </p> <p>This becomes a pattern. By day, I coast through the pressure at work on less than five hours' sleep. I am on efficient automatic pilot, wired. But the anxiety doubles back on me like a boomerang in the early hours, coupled with the fear of staying awake - which becomes, of course, a self-fulfilling prophecy. The boundaries are blurred, each part of my life vampirising the next: sleeplessness taking its toll on health, health affecting work, work impinging on home. And this goes on, week in, week out. </p> <p>They say that nothing ages you like sleep deprivation. So I canvas opinion from friends and acquaintances. Everyone speaks from experience; everyone has known some form of insomnia: Don't look at the clock. Get up. Get up and read. Read in bed. Listen to music. Take a hot bath before retiring. Take a hot bath in the middle of the night. Sleep on your back. On your left side. On your right side. Drink camomile tea. Hot milk. Hot milk with a banana. Have a little tipple. Avoid alcohol. Avoid carbohydrates. Eat wholemeal bread. Eat lots of protein at lunch. Eat lots of protein at night. Don't eat protein at night. Don't eat too much. Don't eat too late. Exercise. </p> <p>I start by stepping up the physical exertion: I cycle to and from work, toy with weight-bearing exercises, take up yoga during my lunch hour. The calm and discipline of yoga pay dividends over the long haul. Sometimes, after several nights of erratic sleep, I am astounded to find myself drifting off during the five minutes of relaxation at the end of the session. But it isn't enough to put a dent in the insomnia. </p> <p>A friend hands me a bottle of Origins' Sensory Therapy Pillow Mist. My sister gives me flash American gadgetry - a pen with a miniature lightbulb on the tip for writing in the dark. Somehow I acquire the CD Sleep Yoga by Paul Bancroft (\u00a312.99, Ziegel), which generates an hour's worth of white noise. All to no avail. </p> <p>Insomnia is held to be a symptom, a wake-up call that signals an underlying cause. And the causes are as difficult to isolate as the 'cures' are subjective and hard to nail down. It's daunting to differentiate among all the possible factors - logistical, psychological, culinary, behavioural - then to systematically cut back, reintroduce, experiment. </p> <p>The process of elimination begins - and my immediate environment seems an easy target. We replace the new bed frame that makes a loud sound like a ship creaking in a storm every time we so much as turn over, buy a lighter-weight duvet, a black-out blind. This sensory deprivation notwithstanding, on some nights I still reach for the eye mask and earplugs - only to find that soundproof-booth oblivion doesn't make a blind bit of difference. </p> <p>Turning towards herbal remedies, I amass an arsenal of potions, tablets, stopper-dispensing liquids. Valerian, kava kava and Herbal Nytol sometimes do the trick for a few hours at a stretch; at other times it is Russian roulette - I down a few capsules by the light of the opened fridge, and still can't surmount the restlessness. </p> <p>I even flee to a retreat in the Malvern Hills which offers massage, reflexology and a flotation tank. Away from home, the insomnia subsides. Because I've altered my habits, escaped my quotidian environment, left my worries behind? Perhaps I've broken the cycle, I think, perhaps it was just a phase. But the minute I bed down in my own flat again, the staccato sleep pattern kicks in once more. </p> <p>Several months have elapsed since the crisis that catalysed my sporadic insomnia - now I combat sleeplessness for no apparent reason; I translate any unease into this ongoing routine. And I begin to sound like a broken record. The Chinese herbalist I go to see turns out to be a Caucasian American specialising in Japanese herbalism. She speaks to me of yin and yang, declares that the energies of daytime spilling into the night are causing me unrest. Over the months, she metes out various powders: dragon bone, peony, ginseng, lotus seed. For a while I feel less wound up, but soon, regular as clockwork, I'm back to my usual trick of intermittent sleep. </p> <p>In another last-ditch effort, I trawl through a few homeopathic chemists. 'You're over-aware,' one pharmacist observes. 'You need to be earthed.' She can recommend a concoction of specific remedies - Arsenica album is ideal for those who wake up at 2am and erratically thereafter - but because homeopathy is holistic, treating not the symptoms but the cause, she reckons it's best to see a homeopath. Sure enough, the little pillules she's given me are no soporific. </p> <p>In desperation, I call on my GP, demand sleeping pills. He prescribes me five Temazepam - only five! - which prove to be a stop-gap palliative that lays me low for five hours, but leaves me shaken the next day, dulled. He also signs me up for the Stress Management Clinic he and a therapist are running. Ironically, it is stressful to down tools and dash out of work early every Monday for six weeks. When it comes time to tally up the stress-inducing events in our lives, everyone in the group scores between 16 and 63 - I'm off the scales at 231. I'd charted such upheavals in the past year as landing a new job; trouble at work; buying a flat; putting the finishing touches on the flat days before throwing a big party; getting married; my husband's heart scare. I win! I have, on paper, quantifiable reasons to be stressed. </p> <p>Each week our earnest, nerve-wracked group tackles stress from a new vantage - what and how we eat; our knee-jerk reactions to tension - and through visualisation, deep breathing and other techniques we learn how to be relaxed yet alert. The process is helpful, makes me question my lifestyle. It is brought home to me that stress can be addictive - you end up craving the stimulus, upping the ante until you fall - and that relaxation is an art, a skill. The key is practice. </p> <p>And it is hard work. I flirt with self-help, keeping Barefoot Doctor's Handbook for the Urban Warrior by Stephen Russell (\u00a38.99, Piatkus) on my bedside table, dip into Ultimate Relaxation: A Seven-Step Programme for Stress-Free Living by Eddie and Debbie Shapiro (\u00a310.99, Quadrille) and peruse the recently published Freedom From Insomnia by Alexander Stalmatski (\u00a37.99, Kyle Cathie), a highly regimented, controversial method which purports to work miracles in five days through shallow breathing. I venture on to the net, finding the questionnaires on <a href=\"http://www.iris-publishing.com\">www.iris-publishing.com</a> an invaluable way to sift through the morass of causes and effects. </p> <p>It's impossible to ascertain what it took to gradually reacquaint myself with sleep. The crisis at work a year ago brought to the fore a delayed reaction to a backlog of stressful events, and interrupted sleep became a pattern I lapsed into when under duress. It's been a question of trouble-shooting - reading up about insomnia, trying herbal supplements and taking a stress-management course have all helped keep the restlessness at bay, and remarkably, a few late-night sessions at the newly opened nearby gym consistently induce a less fractured night's sleep. But the ultimate panacea seems to be time, and things changing slowly over time. Now I go through less extreme variations on the theme: it is rare that I snap out of sleep into panic. Sometimes, with the radio on low, I rediscover warm, dark, escapist drowsiness. Far from being entirely shot of insomnia, I am, however, losing less sleep over losing sleep these days.</p> <p><strong>Eyes wide open </strong></p> <p>\u0095 Famous insomniacs include Charles Dickens, Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, Napoleon, Dorothy Parker, Van Gogh, Marilyn Monroe </p> <p> \u0095 Insomnia is not just a preoccupation linked to our high-octane modern lifestyle - Aristotle wrote Sleep and Sleeplessness in 350BC </p> <p> \u0095 Women tend to be more wakeful than men and are 1.3 times more likely to report insomnia </p> <p> \u0095 Odd cures for insomnia abound: wearing mittens in bed, eating peanut butter before bedtime, and sucking a spoon-shaped radio transmitter while trying to nod off.

Because I've altered my habits, escaped my quotidian environment, left my worries behind? Perhaps I've broken the cycle, I think, perhaps it was just a phase. But the minute I bed down in my own flat again, the staccato sleep pattern kicks in once more. Several months have elapsed since the crisis that catalysed my sporadic insomnia - now I combat sleeplessness for no apparent reason; I translate any unease into this ongoing routine. And I begin to sound like a broken record. The Chinese herbalist I go to see turns out to be a Caucasian American specialising in Japanese herbalism. She speaks to me of yin and yang, declares that the energies of daytime spilling into the night are causing me unrest. Over the months, she metes out various powders: dragon bone, peony, ginseng, lotus seed. For a while I feel less wound up, but soon, regular as clockwork, I'm back to my usual trick of intermittent sleep. In another last-ditch effort, I trawl through a few homeopathic chemists. 'You're over-aware,' one pharmacist observes. 'You need to be earthed.' She can recommend a concoction of specific remedies - Arsenica album is ideal for those who wake up at 2am and erratically thereafter - but because homeopathy is holistic, treating not the symptoms but the cause, she reckons it's best to see a homeopath. Sure enough, the little pillules she's given me are no soporific. In desperation, I call on my GP, demand sleeping pills. He prescribes me five Temazepam - only five! - which prove to be a stop-gap palliative that lays me low for five hours, but leaves me shaken the next day, dulled. He also signs me up for the Stress Management Clinic he and a therapist are running. Ironically, it is stressful to down tools and dash out of work early every Monday for six weeks. When it comes time to tally up the stress-inducing events in our lives, everyone in the group scores between 16 and 63 - I'm off the scales at 231. I'd charted such upheavals in the past year as landing a new job; trouble at work; buying a flat; putting the finishing touches on the flat days before throwing a big party; getting married; my husband's heart scare. I win! I have, on paper, quantifiable reasons to be stressed. Each week our earnest, nerve-wracked group tackles stress from a new vantage - what and how we eat; our knee-jerk reactions to tension - and through visualisation, deep breathing and other techniques we learn how to be relaxed yet alert. The process is helpful, makes me question my lifestyle. It is brought home to me that stress can be addictive - you end up craving the stimulus, upping the ante until you fall - and that relaxation is an art, a skill. The key is practice. And it is hard work. I flirt with self-help, keeping Barefoot Doctor's Handbook for the Urban Warrior by Stephen Russell (\u00a38.99, Piatkus) on my bedside table, dip into Ultimate Relaxation: A Seven-Step Programme for Stress-Free Living by Eddie and Debbie Shapiro (\u00a310.99, Quadrille) and peruse the recently published Freedom From Insomnia by Alexander Stalmatski (\u00a37.99, Kyle Cathie), a highly regimented, controversial method which purports to work miracles in five days through shallow breathing. I venture on to the net, finding the questionnaires on www.iris-publishing.com an invaluable way to sift through the morass of causes and effects. It's impossible to ascertain what it took to gradually reacquaint myself with sleep. The crisis at work a year ago brought to the fore a delayed reaction to a backlog of stressful events, and interrupted sleep became a pattern I lapsed into when under duress. It's been a question of trouble-shooting - reading up about insomnia, trying herbal supplements and taking a stress-management course have all helped keep the restlessness at bay, and remarkably, a few late-night sessions at the newly opened nearby gym consistently induce a less fractured night's sleep. But the ultimate panacea seems to be time, and things changing slowly over time. Now I go through less extreme variations on the theme: it is rare that I snap out of sleep into panic. Sometimes, with the radio on low, I rediscover warm, dark, escapist drowsiness. Far from being entirely shot of insomnia, I am, however, losing less sleep over losing sleep these days. Eyes wide open \u0095 Famous insomniacs include Charles Dickens, Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, Napoleon, Dorothy Parker, Van Gogh, Marilyn Monroe \u0095 Insomnia is not just a preoccupation linked to our high-octane modern lifestyle - Aristotle wrote Sleep and Sleeplessness in 350BC \u0095 Women tend to be more wakeful than men and are 1.3 times more likely to report insomnia \u0095 Odd cures for insomnia abound: wearing mittens in bed, eating peanut butter before bedtime, and sucking a spoon-shaped radio transmitter while trying to nod off. The electromagnetic field is thought to influence the brain's electrical rhythms and encourage relaxation \u0095 Lack of sleep is bad for your brain. The British Sleep Foundation warns that sleeping one hour less than the recommended eight can lower your IQ by one point the next day \u0095 Malaysian radio DJ Halim Othman stayed awake for 42 hours to break the world record for uninterrupted radio broadcast. He was allowed only a 10-minute break every hour to eat, bathe and pray \u0095 The longest period anyone has managed to stay awake is 264 hours. American schoolboy Randy Gardner imposed the trial on himself in 1963 and still holds the world record",

      "body": "<p>My wife Rachael and I had been married a little over one year, when we found out we were having a baby. It was a happy surprise. There were many others, such as the one at roughly nine weeks when we went for an ultrasound dating scan. Looking at the indistinct grey image on the monitor, we noticed a tiny blip, a flickering light racing headlong within the enveloping darkness: it was our baby's heartbeat.</p> <p>Rachael's estimated date of delivery was 3 December 1996. Men don't experience physical sensations to match rushing oestrogen, but when I placed my hand on Rachael's stomach my own feelings were intense. I was full of love for her and the baby and the prospect of being a father. In contrast to many women, Rachael delighted in her changing body. Never more womanly and radiant, she seemed to coast on an emotional high.</p> <p>There was a great deal to learn. Together we read books on everything from breach births to babies' names. There were classes. Rachael found one explaining every medical contingency, and another that emphasised yoga and breathing techniques. These were for women only - partners came on selected occasions for an informal get-together - a peculiarity of this country's approach to fathers that guarantees a feeling of exclusion. We met two of the four community midwives on our team, who made a good impression and were helpful in formulating a birth plan. Sensitivity to parents and open-mindedness are the best aspects of the NHS. The downside is that the number of labouring women on a ward at one time is unpredictable. During a rush, it's a lottery. In addition, the possibility that when the day came we'd end up being delivered by a stranger was unnerving.</p> <p>Less than three weeks before the finish line, we switched horses: Rachael's confidence was shaken by two recent accounts from friends at the NHS hospital where she was scheduled to deliver. We were afraid of an inadequately supervised labour. Time was running out for other options. The Harley Street obstetrician recommended by our GP was a New Zealand smoothie - funny and charming but certainly no feminist: 'The patients that really make my heart sink are the ones who come with a \"birth plan\",' he whirred. 'I tell the ones who ask about a birthing pool that I don't pack swimming trunks. You might think you want aromatherapy oils massaged on your back and soft lights and music, but let me tell you what labour is really like. Once it begins, it hurts. You'll want pain relief. You'll want an epidural. Then I'll take over and you can have a nice cup of tea.'</p> <p>The cavalier attitude notwithstanding, what he was offering was supervision and expertise, and after hearing about women screaming for hours unattended and later performed upon without proper anaesthesia, it was reassuring. He also promised to leave well enough alone if things were going smoothly. Rachael aspired to her mother's natural and trouble-free deliveries (two out of three performed at home), but she was ready to accept pain relief and medical intervention, as a last resort.</p> <p>I wasn't sure what my place was in this ritual. As December approached, I felt a rush of excitement, but was much less certain how I'd feel if I saw Rachael in physical distress, particularly when there would be nothing I could do to help. My apprehensiveness was also cultural: my background is Cuban, not English; none of the women in my family have asked their husbands to witness their deliveries, nor have the men made a beeline toward the delivery room. Rachael did want me, and I was ready to abide, but we found a compromise in asking her close friend Nicola to attend as our birth partner. In the event, I was the one who needed gas and air, Nicola would fill in and lend Rachael her support.</p> <p>On the morning of 3 December, Rachael woke me up, complaining of slight pains. First babies are often late; we thought these might be Braxton-Hicks - false, practice contractions - or even pre-labour. We began timing them at 7.45am: they were three minutes apart, each lasting 45 seconds. She complained of so little pain, it was a difficult at first to grasp how this could be labour, let alone one already fairly established. Rachael telephoned her birth instructor, who urged us, sensing it was going at lightning speed, to get to the hospital. We made our way through heavy traffic and a frosty downpour, arriving there at 10.30am.</p> <p>By the time the first measurement was taken 15 minutes later, Rachael was at 5cm, a little over the halfway mark. She was offered an epidural and declined. The midwife called the obstetrician, who was lecturing at another London hospital. As we waited, the contractions became more intense, with referred pain to the sacrum, and the midwife again offered the epidural, suggesting that labour was likely to go on for another five or six hours, and Rachael would probably be too exhausted to push. Hoping to avoid that scenario, she consented.</p> <p>When the anaesthetist finally arrived at noon, Rachael was in a state of trance; our words became murmurs heard at the end of a long corridor. Another measurement was taken; now it was 8cm. This is what is known as transition, the most intense - but frequently the shortest - phase of labour. The appropriateness of an epidural at this stage is questionable; NHS hospitals rarely dispense them after the 6cm mark. Nicola proposed gas and air to Rachael. The anaesthetist conferred with the obstetrician by telephone and without consulting Rachael, administered not the 'mobile' epidural she had expected, but the full dead-from-the-waist-down dose. With the last contraction, before the anaesthesia took hold, Rachael felt an urge to push - then nothing.</p> <p>With hindsight, my passivity depresses me. I didn't know what her pain ceiling would be, and felt at a disadvantage making any kind of case to people who supervised deliveries every day. My lack of experience prevented me from taking a more active role in helping to avert the managed delivery Rachael did not want. When she agreed to the epidural, I confess I was relieved.</p> <p>Our obstetrician arrived unfashionably late at 2pm. 'How nice of you to squeeze us in,' Rachael remarked. 'You almost missed it.' 'No worries,' he smirked. A preliminary examination confirmed that labour had ground to a halt and contractions were weak. The hormone solution to resuscitate them linked via a drip drew little initial response. The dose had to be increased steadily throughout the course of the afternoon until 4.50pm, when Rachael was asked to put down her cup and begin to push.</p> <p>She watched the monitor for cues, only to feel the faintest tightening. Unable to squat or kneel (thanks to the epidural), she pushed while lying on her back, with one foot on the midwife and another on the doctor. Absent from her natural impulse, Rachael says today she felt completely detached, even self-conscious.</p> <p>The full mechanised delight lay in store, beginning with the episiotomy, an incision to enlarge the vaginal opening. Eighty to 90 per cent of new mothers have them, according to recent studies in the United States that are critical of their general use and also show a comparable rate of increased blood loss during delivery and unpleasant complications (such as anal incontinence) following the procedure.</p> <p>The clicking and snapping of flesh being cut makes fingernails on a blackboard sound like a string quartet. The doctor made the first incision to apply a ventouse. When the implement disengaged, he cut again, then again, deep this time, and finally brought out the forceps. The tension in the room was excruciating. Our baby girl was born at 5.30pm, weighing 7lb 5oz. 'She looks just like your mother,' beamed Rachael.</p> <p>An expression of shock is etched in my mind: the baby could literally have been asking, 'What is this?' So, unfortunately, is the obstetrician's non-existent effort to shield us from the carnage spilled all over the room; we had the front-row view. Surreal is the polite word to describe the scene: Rachael propped up on her bed, slashed and gaping, sipping tea, asking the doctor about his sewing technique, while he calmly stitched the tissue back into place. The delivery suite looked like the Battle of Waterloo. Harley Street had provided the very experience we had hoped to avoid with the NHS, only here it came with a fee and a smile.</p> <p>But we had our little girl. Gazing at her tiny wrinkled hands and feet and listening to her first, plaintive cries, the worst images of the birth room seemed very far away. I felt only gratitude. The next day a procession of family, friends and flowers made its way into our room. Rachael badly needed to recover, but kept the festivities going even as she nursed and we took turns holding our little bundle and discussed names. By the end, she was exhausted.</p> <p>When I arrived the following morning, she mentioned that the baby had been sick. In the darkness, the vomit looked green. When I asked the midwives about this, they said it was normal. I noticed how the baby, so alert and self-possessed the day before, now seemed floppy and listless. Like a little dormouse, she slept most of the morning.</p> <p>In the afternoon, while Rachael was having a bath, the baby was sick again. The vomit was dark green. We called a midwife immediately, who said she didn't know what it could mean but she'd call the paediatrician straight away. Our daughter was very still and quiet throughout his examination, after which he whispered something to the nurse about a radiology report.</p> <p>He didn't tell us anything immediately; all he said was that the baby had vomited bile, which pointed to an obstruction. He needed a gastrointestinal (or upper GI) contrast study to know more. Suddenly, the toll of labour hit us; Rachael was so tired she had a hard time taking in the news. I accompanied the nurse to obtain the X-ray and held my baby, kissing her cool forehead as she slumbered on. As they held her down to obtain the image, her weak sobs pierced my heart.</p> <p>I knew by the way the internist studied the X-ray that something wasn't right. Evening had settled, when we next met with the paediatrician, who spoke more openly. The upper GI showed a classic 'double bubble', indicating air in the stomach and lower in the intestine past the obstruction without being present anywhere else. He said he'd need to call a surgeon to confer, a famous friend from the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital whose specialty, he said, intending to comfort us, was separating Siamese twins. His grave expression left little to the imagination: our baby's life was hanging in the balance. The surgeon only asked him one question: 'Are you matching blood yet?'</p> <p>While the surgeon made his way to see us, we sat with our baby, still fast asleep, and began to come to terms with the certainty of surgery. We made calls to our families. The sadness of our situation was intolerable. I was reduced to a begging wreck. None of my questions or attempts to secure hopeful assurances met with success. They couldn't be certain of what they'd find. Rachael was so spent, she couldn't even weep.</p> <p>The surgeon entered the room, which in the presence of so many bouquets had suddenly taken on the look of a mortuary. He examined the baby and dourly told us the situation was 'very grave'. He handed me a legal release form to sign, in which I was taking responsibility for her surgery, and our baby was wheeled away. It was nearing midnight.</p> <p>I was 16 years old when my father died in front of me of cancer at 39. I thought life had no heavier weapon to wield against happiness. Now, having experienced the greatest joy in the birth of my daughter, I learned there was something more terrible than the loss of a parent, the prospect of losing a child. Waiting for the operation to begin, I experienced the insanity of grief. I found the sight of Rachael on the phone to her mother unbearable. Finally welling up with tears, all she could say was, 'poor little soul'. I felt like my life was being consumed by shadows.</p> <p>A soul was all our baby was. We hadn't agreed on a name. From our list, we chose one we loved, whose significance was more potent than ever before. Often mistaken as Russian because of the Romanov grand duchess, it is actually a Greek name. It refers to Easter and the Resurrection, meaning literally, 'she will rise again'. To the extent that we could pray for her life, we named our beautiful girl Anastasia.</p> <p>When the doctors returned 90 minutes later, their open smiles more than hinted at their news. The operation had been successful, but we were still not out of the woods. Anastasia had malrotation of the bowel, an anomaly of which the incidence rate and cause remain unknown. Either sex can be affected; approximately 60 per cent of cases present in the first month of life. Symptoms include the bilious vomiting she experienced plus three she did not, abdominal pain, abdominal distention and extreme dehydration. In the fourth week of fetal life, the entire bowel is a straight tube following the line of the superior mesenteric artery, or SMA. In a normal pregnancy, the bowel rotates in place to the left of the SMA between the seventh and 12th weeks of gestation. In Anastasia's case, intestinal rotation and fixation did not complete. It was a time bomb.</p> <p>Most patients with malrotation develop volvulus - a twisting around the axis, resulting in a strangulation of the bowel's arterial flow - within the first week. Peristalsis, the motion of digestion, is an immediate cause; vomiting bile provides the clue. The reason there were so few guarantees going into surgery was the possibility of necrosis with perforations. In that instance, Anastasia would have lost some - or most, or all - of her digestive tract; and more than likely, her life. There is a 28 per cent mortality rate associated with midgut volvulus, but timing is everything. Our swift diagnosis had been a stroke of luck.</p> <p>Our surgeon performed the Ladd's procedure named after Dr William E Ladd of the Boston Children's Hospital, who developed it in the 1920s. He unravelled the twisted bowel and, observing an immediate change in colour back to pink, judged it to be viable. Before returning the bowel back into the abdominal cavity, he also performed an appendectomy - a routine procedure, as the misplaced appendix can impede a correct diagnosis of appendicitis in later life.</p> <p>While no portion of the bowel was sectioned, it was nevertheless a major operation for a two-day-old baby. There was additional concern that the intestine, which resists handling, could form adhesions requiring more surgery. The first order of business was to wait for the return of normal gastric sounds; the introduction of breast milk would follow; the prognosis, if her digestive system recovered, would be excellent.</p> <p>There were tears, not of joy or sadness even, but of devastation; it had been impossible in the space of a few hours to adjust emotionally to the enormity of what had just happened. I didn't want to see Anastasia in the neonatal unit that night, because I was afraid. A midwife called and urged me, saying I'd feel better. So I took the lift with my wounded wife to witness the survival of my wounded daughter. In her little plastic box, plugged full of morphine, hooked up to IVs and monitors, and wearing a nasogastric tube and a large laparotomy scar, I had to remind myself that this was the outcome we had prayed for.</p> <p>Anastasia spent 10 days in intensive care. Separated from her baby, Rachael also remained at the hospital, having initially emerged from labour with anaemia (due to blood loss), a displaced pelvis and extreme post-operative pain. She struggled to establish a milk supply for a baby who might not live. I found myself wandering through London trying to find announcement cards, hopeful but insecure over their ultimate use.</p> <p>Anastasia made a strong recovery and did survive, but I was haunted. I felt solitary, during the weeks and months following her birth. There is no training for a near-death experience. No one tells you about the possibility; no one wants the discomfort of hearing about it afterwards. The social halitosis of a hard-luck story provokes in most people the urge to stampede. This deafening silence extended even to us as parents - we couldn't bring it up. The most cursory tasks - changing a nappy, getting out of the house in time - made me impatient and angry. My anxiety was rampaging, my need for distractions of every kind consuming. What Rachael needed most was peace, tranquillity, and a reliable husband. For a time, I was reckless with time, money and, ultimately, with my wife's bond of trust. I was dancing with ghosts.</p> <p>When they came home, the expectations and hopes of the previous months had dissolved into an anxious vigil. Due to the slow re-introduction of milk, Anastasia had established a pattern of small and frequent feeds, which resulted in her needing to nurse almost constantly. She was also distressed and unsettled and cried from evening through to daybreak. By five weeks, Rachael was worn out. Her body seemed to revolt. She suffered mastitis, a terrible eczema, and a rare form of tendonitis that meant she couldn't lift Anastasia while her wrist was in a splint. The most devastating consequence came when Rachael's nipples began to crack, and once again she had to interrupt her nursing and pump instead. Misdiagnosed as a skin condition of Rachael's, Anastasia had in fact developed thrush in her mouth, a common complaint, but the disruption proved conclusive: Rachael lost her milk. Depleted of emotional resources, devoid of sleep and unable to communicate, we found ourselves on a relentless treadmill, both feeling as trapped and failed as if we were serving life sentences. Rachael deserved more from me, and consequently, I shall always feel partly responsible for the devastating postpartum depression she suffered later.</p> <p>Our marriage almost collapsed. For me, the close proximity of birth to death neutralised my instinct for protection. For Rachael, the unexpected price of regaining a daughter was, she felt, the loss of her partner.</p> <p>Since that time, the steps have been slow and occasionally painful. One by one, we've managed to put things back together. We sometimes talk of having another baby. Our choices can only serve us better the next time. The other day we asked Anastasia, who turns four in December, whether she wanted a brother or a sister. She said she'd like a dog.</p>",

Our baby girl was born at 5.30pm, weighing 7lb 5oz. 'She looks just like your mother,' beamed Rachael. An expression of shock is etched in my mind: the baby could literally have been asking, 'What is this?' So, unfortunately, is the obstetrician's non-existent effort to shield us from the carnage spilled all over the room; we had the front-row view. Surreal is the polite word to describe the scene: Rachael propped up on her bed, slashed and gaping, sipping tea, asking the doctor about his sewing technique, while he calmly stitched the tissue back into place. The delivery suite looked like the Battle of Waterloo. Harley Street had provided the very experience we had hoped to avoid with the NHS, only here it came with a fee and a smile. But we had our little girl. Gazing at her tiny wrinkled hands and feet and listening to her first, plaintive cries, the worst images of the birth room seemed very far away. I felt only gratitude. The next day a procession of family, friends and flowers made its way into our room. Rachael badly needed to recover, but kept the festivities going even as she nursed and we took turns holding our little bundle and discussed names. By the end, she was exhausted. When I arrived the following morning, she mentioned that the baby had been sick. In the darkness, the vomit looked green. When I asked the midwives about this, they said it was normal. I noticed how the baby, so alert and self-possessed the day before, now seemed floppy and listless. Like a little dormouse, she slept most of the morning. In the afternoon, while Rachael was having a bath, the baby was sick again. The vomit was dark green. We called a midwife immediately, who said she didn't know what it could mean but she'd call the paediatrician straight away. Our daughter was very still and quiet throughout his examination, after which he whispered something to the nurse about a radiology report. He didn't tell us anything immediately; all he said was that the baby had vomited bile, which pointed to an obstruction. He needed a gastrointestinal (or upper GI) contrast study to know more. Suddenly, the toll of labour hit us; Rachael was so tired she had a hard time taking in the news. I accompanied the nurse to obtain the X-ray and held my baby, kissing her cool forehead as she slumbered on. As they held her down to obtain the image, her weak sobs pierced my heart. I knew by the way the internist studied the X-ray that something wasn't right. Evening had settled, when we next met with the paediatrician, who spoke more openly. The upper GI showed a classic 'double bubble', indicating air in the stomach and lower in the intestine past the obstruction without being present anywhere else. He said he'd need to call a surgeon to confer, a famous friend from the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital whose specialty, he said, intending to comfort us, was separating Siamese twins. His grave expression left little to the imagination: our baby's life was hanging in the balance. The surgeon only asked him one question: 'Are you matching blood yet?' While the surgeon made his way to see us, we sat with our baby, still fast asleep, and began to come to terms with the certainty of surgery. We made calls to our families. The sadness of our situation was intolerable. I was reduced to a begging wreck. None of my questions or attempts to secure hopeful assurances met with success. They couldn't be certain of what they'd find. Rachael was so spent, she couldn't even weep. The surgeon entered the room, which in the presence of so many bouquets had suddenly taken on the look of a mortuary. He examined the baby and dourly told us the situation was 'very grave'. He handed me a legal release form to sign, in which I was taking responsibility for her surgery, and our baby was wheeled away. It was nearing midnight. I was 16 years old when my father died in front of me of cancer at 39. I thought life had no heavier weapon to wield against happiness. Now, having experienced the greatest joy in the birth of my daughter, I learned there was something more terrible than the loss of a parent, the prospect of losing a child. Waiting for the operation to begin, I experienced the insanity of grief. I found the sight of Rachael on the phone to her mother unbearable. Finally welling up with tears, all she could say was, 'poor little soul'. I felt like my life was being consumed by shadows. A soul was all our baby was. We hadn't agreed on a name. From our list, we chose one we loved, whose significance was more potent than ever before. Often mistaken as Russian because of the Romanov grand duchess, it is actually a Greek name. It refers to Easter and the Resurrection, meaning literally, 'she will rise again'. To the extent that we could pray for her life, we named our beautiful girl Anastasia. When the doctors returned 90 minutes later, their open smiles more than hinted at their news. The operation had been successful, but we were still not out of the woods. Anastasia had malrotation of the bowel, an anomaly of which the incidence rate and cause remain unknown. Either sex can be affected; approximately 60 per cent of cases present in the first month of life. Symptoms include the bilious vomiting she experienced plus three she did not, abdominal pain, abdominal distention and extreme dehydration. In the fourth week of fetal life, the entire bowel is a straight tube following the line of the superior mesenteric artery, or SMA. In a normal pregnancy, the bowel rotates in place to the left of the SMA between the seventh and 12th weeks of gestation. In Anastasia's case, intestinal rotation and fixation did not complete. It was a time bomb. Most patients with malrotation develop volvulus - a twisting around the axis, resulting in a strangulation of the bowel's arterial flow - within the first week. Peristalsis, the motion of digestion, is an immediate cause; vomiting bile provides the clue. The reason there were so few guarantees going into surgery was the possibility of necrosis with perforations. In that instance, Anastasia would have lost some - or most, or all - of her digestive tract; and more than likely, her life. There is a 28 per cent mortality rate associated with midgut volvulus, but timing is everything. Our swift diagnosis had been a stroke of luck. Our surgeon performed the Ladd's procedure named after Dr William E Ladd of the Boston Children's Hospital, who developed it in the 1920s. He unravelled the twisted bowel and, observing an immediate change in colour back to pink, judged it to be viable. Before returning the bowel back into the abdominal cavity, he also performed an appendectomy - a routine procedure, as the misplaced appendix can impede a correct diagnosis of appendicitis in later life. While no portion of the bowel was sectioned, it was nevertheless a major operation for a two-day-old baby. There was additional concern that the intestine, which resists handling, could form adhesions requiring more surgery. The first order of business was to wait for the return of normal gastric sounds; the introduction of breast milk would follow; the prognosis, if her digestive system recovered, would be excellent. There were tears, not of joy or sadness even, but of devastation; it had been impossible in the space of a few hours to adjust emotionally to the enormity of what had just happened. I didn't want to see Anastasia in the neonatal unit that night, because I was afraid. A midwife called and urged me, saying I'd feel better. So I took the lift with my wounded wife to witness the survival of my wounded daughter. In her little plastic box, plugged full of morphine, hooked up to IVs and monitors, and wearing a nasogastric tube and a large laparotomy scar, I had to remind myself that this was the outcome we had prayed for. Anastasia spent 10 days in intensive care. Separated from her baby, Rachael also remained at the hospital, having initially emerged from labour with anaemia (due to blood loss), a displaced pelvis and extreme post-operative pain. She struggled to establish a milk supply for a baby who might not live. I found myself wandering through London trying to find announcement cards, hopeful but insecure over their ultimate use. Anastasia made a strong recovery and did survive, but I was haunted. I felt solitary, during the weeks and months following her birth. There is no training for a near-death experience. No one tells you about the possibility; no one wants the discomfort of hearing about it afterwards. The social halitosis of a hard-luck story provokes in most people the urge to stampede. This deafening silence extended even to us as parents - we couldn't bring it up. The most cursory tasks - changing a nappy, getting out of the house in time - made me impatient and angry. My anxiety was rampaging, my need for distractions of every kind consuming. What Rachael needed most was peace, tranquillity, and a reliable husband. For a time, I was reckless with time, money and, ultimately, with my wife's bond of trust. I was dancing with ghosts. When they came home, the expectations and hopes of the previous months had dissolved into an anxious vigil. Due to the slow re-introduction of milk, Anastasia had established a pattern of small and frequent feeds, which resulted in her needing to nurse almost constantly. She was also distressed and unsettled and cried from evening through to daybreak. By five weeks, Rachael was worn out. Her body seemed to revolt. She suffered mastitis, a terrible eczema, and a rare form of tendonitis that meant she couldn't lift Anastasia while her wrist was in a splint. The most devastating consequence came when Rachael's nipples began to crack, and once again she had to interrupt her nursing and pump instead. Misdiagnosed as a skin condition of Rachael's, Anastasia had in fact developed thrush in her mouth, a common complaint, but the disruption proved conclusive: Rachael lost her milk. Depleted of emotional resources, devoid of sleep and unable to communicate, we found ourselves on a relentless treadmill, both feeling as trapped and failed as if we were serving life sentences. Rachael deserved more from me, and consequently, I shall always feel partly responsible for the devastating postpartum depression she suffered later. Our marriage almost collapsed. For me, the close proximity of birth to death neutralised my instinct for protection. For Rachael, the unexpected price of regaining a daughter was, she felt, the loss of her partner. Since that time, the steps have been slow and occasionally painful. One by one, we've managed to put things back together. We sometimes talk of having another baby. Our choices can only serve us better the next time. The other day we asked Anastasia, who turns four in December, whether she wanted a brother or a sister. She said she'd like a dog.",

      "body": "<p>It often takes a cold or minor illness to make us take a closer look at our grey faces in the mirror and realise that our bodies are run down. You need to nourish your body if you are to make it through the winter without feeling exhausted and succumbing to cold after cold. With this in mind, I've designed a five-step Bodyfoods protection plan that is suitable for everyone, including young children, who are as prone to feeling washed out as their parents, especially at this stage of the winter term, when schools are hotbeds of infection.</p> <p><b> Step 1 </b> Avoid food and drinks that seem to boost your energy levels, but actually make you feel more exhausted in the long run. Particularly avoid caffeine, which is contained in tea, coffee, colas and stimulating drinks like Red Bull. Prepare to endure 48 hours of feeling headachy, shattered and crabby, but you'll start to feel much more alive if you tough it out. (Take an analgesic such as paracetamol, and be sure to drink plenty of water and to rest during this withdrawal period.) Also eliminate rapidly absorbed, sweet foods such as cake, chocolate, biscuits and sugary drinks from your diet, as these will destabilise your energy levels, sending them sky high one minute and crashing the next. Overly sweet foods can also irritate the gut and make you feel bloated.</p> <p><b> Step 2 </b> Eat more vitamin C and zinc-rich foods to strengthen your immune system. Vitamin C encourages the brain to produce endorphins, the 'happy hormones' that can lift your mood and help your body to absorb essential minerals like iron. When you're feeling washed out, include plenty of iron in your diet, and if you don't like red meat, the most easily absorbed iron source, green, leafy vegetables, pulses and eggs offer a palatable alternative. Foods that contain vitamin C and zinc include all fresh fruits and vegetables, wholegrains, lean meat, crumbly cheeses and seafood. It is vital at this time of year to eat at least five portions of fresh fruit or vegetables a day, a target that can be achieved with minimal effort if you drink a glass of juice made with three fresh fruits or eat a few satsumas in the morning and have vegetables or salads with the rest of your meals. When you're run down, it's also important to have a good-sized portion of a zinc-rich protein a day, such as chicken, fish, a few eggs or cheese. If you follow these guidelines, you should satisfy your body's requirements for protein, vitamin C and zinc.</p> <p><b> Step 3 </b> My mum, who's a music teacher, often finds the start of the school year draining, and by the Christmas holiday she's virtually on her knees. She wouldn't mind feeling exhausted so much if only she didn't tend to break out in cold sores. Cold sores are a symptom of the herpes simplex virus, which causes blisters to develop on or around the mouth and can also manifest itself as genital herpes. The blisters are painful and disfiguring while they're at their 'angry' stage, and once the herpes virus has entered your body, it can follow a pattern of dormancy and eruption that lasts for years. If you are a herpes sufferer, being run down means that you're more likely to develop cold sores, but help is at hand. Increase your intake of the essential amino acid lysine, which suppresses levels of arginine in the body, an amino acid that promotes herpes-related viral growth. Boost your intake of lysine-packed foods, such as vegetables, fish and chicken, while reducing the amount of nuts, chocolate, carob and seeds that you eat, all of which are rich in arginine. Taking a 1,000mg capsule of lysine three or four times a day on an empty stomach can also suppress or banish a flare-up, while taking a 500mg capsule of echinacea three times a day will help to strengthen your immune system. Dabbing cold sores with tea tree oil a few times a day may further encourage them to disappear.</p> <p><b> Step 4 </b> Even if you don't suffer from cold sores, you may find echinacea a helpful prophylactic remedy. Medicinal herbalists recommend that you take the above-mentioned dose for six to eight weeks, then give your body a break for a few weeks, by which time you should feel stronger. If you end up reverting to your bad old habits and cutting nutritional corners, however, it won't be long before you feel lousy again, as your body needs weeks, even months, of nurturing before it can withstand the negative effects caused by the odd 'off' day. It's rather like failing to complete a course of antibiotics: if you stop taking them when you're feeling better, but haven't finished the course, their benefits will be diluted.</p> <p><b> Step 5 </b> A good night's sleep is an important step towards feeling re-energised. Stress can disrupt sleeping patterns, as can eating fatty or overly sweet foods before going to bed. Slow-release, nourishing starches have a soporific effect, so opt for pasta or a good-sized portion of potatoes, rice, polenta or bread for your evening meal. Since caffeine hinders sleep, turn to a herbal infusion before bed. Although infusions made with individual herbs like camomile or lemon balm are effective, the Neals Yard sleeping blend (which also contains passionflower and hops) has recently been lulling me into a revitalising, body-strengthening slumber.</p> <p>\u0095 Jane Clarke is a state-registered dietician and author of the Bodyfoods series of books</p>",

      "body": "<p>Whatever control you fail to exercise in the real world, it is yours, all yours, in the virtual world of the new computer game. In Black &amp; White you can literally be the skeletal hand of God, moving over the screen, pointing the finger of fate at any of your world's inhabitants. One click, one wave of the hand, and you can perform miracles. You might find a woman, broken, searching for her lost son. The son is hurt and dying in a forest. You can revive him, return him, and light up the lives of two lost souls. Or you can kill him, maybe set light to his mother's home, and destroy the village. Their fate is in your pixelated hand. In this world, you take control. You've got the power.</p> <p>Created in Britain, Black &amp; White is the electronic game that will take the genre into a new dimension, way beyond the likes of PlayStation 2, which launches later this month. The point of Black &amp; White is that it is more than a game. Players begin to care about this world. It immerses them like a book or a film, because it is not about competing or winning, it's about witnessing a story that you are creating.</p> <p>The British are lauded abroad as the most innovative games designers in the world. It's not a case of 'the British are coming' on this one - they've already arrived. The Japanese may have altered the image of the industry when Sony created PlayStation, the French and the Americans may have cornered the market as games publishers, but the British have the big ideas. The ideas that travel well and translate better. There are more design studios in the UK than anywhere else.</p> <p>Now the industry has been recognised with a label: Britsoft. Like Britpop, Britart or Britlit, Britsoft too has its stars: companies with names like Codemasters, Rare, Rebellion, Free Radical Design, Elixir, Lionhead. With the publication later this month of The Britsoft Book (\u00a350, ELSPA), the industry will be recognised as one of Britain's greatest exports.</p> <p>Peter Molyneux of Lionhead is described as the godfather of the Britsoft movement, and widely credited as the originator of the God-game genre. But never before has the player actually been cast in the role of God. Perhaps the closest was the brilliant The Sims from the mind of the American Will Wright. Its success? Its appeal to people who had never picked up a computer game - the mainstream audience that has become the Holy Grail for the creators of electronic games. The game led women and gay men, among others, into a realm of entertainment traditionally ghettoised as a boy's-own world of computerised dungeons, dragons, dwarves and goblins.</p> <p>The Sims jumpstarted the imagination of a thirtysomething breed entertained elsewhere by lifestyle spreads, home improvement, makeover shows, surveillance TV and soaps. Fundamentally, The Sims allowed you to create and control a family within a neighbourhood, send them to work, choose their wallpaper and keep them alive with regular visits to the fridge. The fact that Big Brother is to be transformed into a computer game smells like yesterday's news, coming six months after The Sims landed.</p> <p>But The Sims is a chunk of a bigger story. The God game has come to consume the thoughts of major players in the games industry, in a bid to capture the mainstream audience. More than anyone else, Molyneux has set his sights on bringing non-game players to consoles and computers. At one point during the making of Black &amp; White, Molyneux and his team (including a director and a cameraman) spent hours deciding how long it would take for a bead of sweat to roll down the cheek of a character. If computer games now call upon the skills of those in film, the detail applied to the imagery is as intricate as that which applies to painting, and the research for the content of a game almost as extensive as that for a weighty novel.</p> <p>When you look at the games world, it isn't difficult to understand why Japan, the US, Europe and currently the British government are taking a long, hard, excited look at Britsoft. As an industry, its sales this year surpassed that of video in the UK. It's almost level-pegging with the music industry in terms of revenue. Last year British exports in television totalled \u00a3444m. The leisure software industry came in at \u00a3503m. It is a far more significant export than the British film industry. For instance, it is rumoured that the film GoldenEye cost in the region of \u00a3100m to make and took a reputed \u00a3240m. Meanwhile, the computer game cost \u00a34m and notched up sales of \u00a3250m. Tomb Raider is currently being made into a film, with Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft, but the trend now is for the reversal of this process. Films are increasingly turning to electronic games designers to make the game before the film has barely been cast. The computer game for The Italian Job, for instance, has been completed before anyone has signed on the line for the planned film sequel.</p> <p>It's no wonder that another example of the increasing legitimacy of the British games business, and one that sees it blossoming from being 'the Cinderella of the entertainment industry', is its very own annual BAFTA ceremony. Molyneux was a member on the council that launched the awards. 'I remember thinking that these are the people who would have the answer to the question that I had wanted to answer. These people would know how to entertain people. I was just shocked that they didn't. And they viewed computer games with such a degree of suspicion. They didn't understand. I still don't think the full force of what computer entertainment is has been felt yet. But I think the tremors have.'</p> <p>It's true. The European software leisure market is currently estimated to be worth $6.27bn. Last year, the value of the UK market clocked out at close to \u00a31bn. Possibly the best example of the seismic impact of Britsoft in the global games market was illustrated by the Japanese company that built what it considered to be an English village in which to place its workforce so as to inspire the kind of games ideas that emerge from British minds.</p> <p>Actually, if Britsoft has a nerve centre, it has little in common with either a traditional, idyllic English village or the futuristic cityscapes of Blade Runner (a key influence in games designers' common culture, and as endemic as the artifacts that appear on the desks at their workstations: statuettes of Darth Vader, Austin Powers, jelly monsters, models of Bond-like cars, and slogans - 'I wish that I was where I am', 'Hit me baby one more time'). Leamington Spa seems to be the place where most of Britsoft's main companies have congregated. 'We started out working from two stables,' says David Darling. He founded Codemasters with his brother Richard. It now consumes most of a former farm somewhere near the M40, with outfits in France, Germany and the US.</p> <p>Not far away are the Oliver twins, who run Blitz games (about to launch Chicken Run), and the Stamper brothers at Rare. This last duo is perhaps the Barclay Brothers of the industry: rich workaholics who shun publicity. They emerged at a recent industry awards ceremony to collect their prize, saying nothing, with their faces concealed beneath Lone Ranger scarves. Nearby Oxford houses Rebellion, with the Kingsley brothers at the helm. In another neck of the woods, the Collier twins and the Pickfords. Brothers. All brothers.</p> <p>This is the common theme within Britsoft. It's odd, and perfect somehow, because even though games designers have long since ceased to be a breed apart, something to be avoided like Scientologists or drunks, you still, on meeting them, expect something strange to emerge. A tweedle-dee-tweedle-dumbness of the twins perhaps. A Disney tie.</p> <p>Brothers? It seems that as surely as solitary male adolescents disappeared to their bedrooms to masturbate or sniff glue, a boy and his brother hitting puberty in the mid-80s disappeared to their room in the hope of becoming computer programmers. Or rather, one would design and the other would programme. One would be attractive, the other would programme.</p> <p>And when you get beyond the fact that brothers seem to do this stuff extremely well, you wonder: why the British? 'The British have always been inventors, exploring new horizons, and computer games are part of those new horizons,' says Jason Kingsley, seated in a converted warehouse in a cobbled street in Oxford. Below, on the studio floor, there's the team that makes up Rebellion. All of whom are passionate gamesplayers, he says. Again, a stereotype is kicked into touch. Many of them look as though they could be moonlighting from club spreads in i-D and sleazenation. No sign of any arbiters of gothic chic or the Marilyn Manson disciples that emerge in the press when games are cited as the impetus for schoolyard massacres such as those in Kentucky and Colorado.</p> <p>According to Chris Kingsley, there is another reason that Britain is leading the way in games design: 'We've always had our mad inventors, like Clive Sinclair. For me, one of the great things about doing this is that it allows you to invent without all the bits. You can invent a programme for flight simulation without going out to build a plane.'</p> <p>All paths lead to Clive Sinclair, according to the leading lights of Britsoft. This was the ginger-haired genius who created the home computer on these shores with his little black box. Those that touched the Sinclair Spectrum can recall the experience the way lesser mortals recall losing their virginity. Molyneux remembers his first time. 'It was like a choir of angels. Programming for me was a godsend. I was very dyslexic. I couldn't draw or write, but I found I could be creative without those disciplines. I found my voice.'</p> <p>It was an apparatus that enabled boffins to programme as well as play, thereby becoming a computer experience exclusive to Britain. It was a culture that didn't exist elsewhere. What transpired was the equivalent of music-mad teenagers going to their rooms with three chords and a guitar and swelling into an underground movement. At the time, those of us outside of it - our brains stretched to capacity by the Rubik's cube - expected these boys to metamorphose into the kind of men who wear novelty socks and wax lyrical about loft insulation. Had someone proffered the argument that the geeks would one day inherit the earth, the reaction would have been that which greeted Clive Sinclair when he jumped in the C5 and drove into obscurity.</p> <p>But essentially, it was the computer-games industry that started the ball rolling and got millions of people bringing personal computers into their homes. Not all of those who formed the nascent network that grew into Britsoft stayed the course. Some ducked out, one jumped from a tall building, another became a sheep farmer. But those that survived and prospered made it to the next level. They now command armies of artists, programmers, designers, and conquer worlds. And many of them are not yet 30.</p> <p>If the games industry were human, it would now be an adolescent male, which is why sex, girls and maturity are the things on its mind. The success of Lara Croft has sparked an abundance of Bond-like heroines with figures that are beginning to resemble a more realistic female form: Agent Archer (based on the looks of former L'Or\u00e9al model Mitzi Martin), Joanna Dark and the forthcoming Carmen Blake in Titanium Angels. The last is a product from the publishing company SCI, created by the most successful woman in the British games industry who isn't virtual, Pat Cavanagh. She believes that Tomb Raider can actually be credited with introducing more female players into the mix. 'Also, if you look at the statistics, you see that Nintendo players are 45 per cent female.' She herself seems more Moneypenny than Bond, seated in her riverside company in Battersea. 'Doom and Quake and the shoot-'em-up games for the PC were for the boys, but Mario and Sonic were products that began to appeal to women,' she says.</p> <p>The few women working elsewhere in the industry tend to arrive via the artistic route rather than as programmers. The lead artist at Codemasters, Rachel Wood, says the appeal of working in games for her is the scope of what can now be produced on screen thanks to current technology. She believes more women in the workforce will begin to have an impact on the content. Certainly the timing is perfect. Black &amp; White is one of a number of games in development that deal with more cerebral themes, and even a level of morality on the part of the player.</p> <p>At Codemasters a game called The Realm attracts 49 per cent female players, according to David Darling. It's an online game, which is another direction in which the industry is headed. This marks its entry into another world of possibility, and the introduction of an offshoot industry that is expected to become massive.</p> <p>'The online games are crossing the gender gap,' says Darling. 'You can have thousands of people playing at once. With The Realm, we've got 10,000 subscribers. Every evening 1,000 of them are in this world. They choose a character and a sex. The emphasis is less on combat and more on a kind of social activity.'</p> <p>Along with these more cerebral themes, and the prospect of games becoming a bigger multi-player experience, the contemporary world as a setting is central to pushing them further into the mainstream. All of which moves the content further from its original territory of sci-fi, Tolkienesque fantasy, shoot ups and shoot outs. There's also an endeavour to give the player more of an all-round experience, dealing with a gamut of emotions, rather than those that accompany death and destruction. Perhaps this is why the forthcoming PlayStation 2 has incorporated something called 'an emotion engine'.</p> <p>If the first incarnation of PlayStation took the video game from the kids' bedroom to the living room, its second coming will see it competing with the television for the eyeballs of the whole family, until Microsoft's next born, the X-box, joins the race.</p> <p>The demographic for PlayStation proved to be that of 29-year-old males. It was the first console that was targeted at fathers and sons, neither of whom were strangers to interactive entertainment, having sampled Nintendo, Atari and Gameboy. Sony's plans for PlayStation 2 predominantly expand the demographic. The ads for the forthcoming machine will feature exclusively in lifestyle magazines, and include images of the middle-aged and the elderly. Also, in its bid to appeal to non-gamesplayers, it is being marketed as an entertainment unit on which to experience DVD, and the internet, instead of solely a games console.</p> <p>But it will also be the platform for the next wave of new Britsoft games, such as Republic, a game expected to appear later next year, and as eagerly anticipated as Black &amp; White. It is being developed at Elixir studios in Camden. Its setting is the fictional country of Novistrana, in which you get to assist one of the region's million inhabitants in their pursuit of the presidency. Once again, it is simultaneously a God game and a morality game. The path you choose, whether it be as a Gandhi figure or a Hitler figure, will reflect the kind of leader you become.</p> <p>'A real-world setting is important because the man in the street doesn't care about goblins,' says Joe McDonagh of Elixir. 'It's the same with violence in games. It has an important role. But it has to be in a real-world context for adults to understand it.' Even though he sees film as a poor second to games, it is this modern backdrop that is likely to turn filmgoers into gamesplayers.</p> <p>This pursuit of realism has also made the advertising industry wake up to Britsoft. Product placement is prohibited in television but remains legal in games. Consequently, Diesel have brought their brand to King Pin and the imminent Driver 2.</p> <p>'Computer games have come a long way from being little stick men onscreen,' says McDonagh. 'Then, they couldn't do anything except the most basic thing you could teach them - to hit one another, beat each other up. Now we can teach them anything. It's almost like having a baby on the computer.'</p> <p>'I think this is the era that the industry will come of age, because technology is doing some major things that you don't have to be a geeky techhead to appreciate,' says Demis Hassabis, founder of Elixir, and at 24, the industry's wunderkind. He looks 12. Tiny. Cute. More of a key ring than a computer games designer. 'I spend almost every waking hour thinking about games,' he says. He started playing them at four. At seven, he taught himself how to programme. He has his own theory as to why Britsoft is a world leader. 'The Americans are less original than British games designers, and the Japanese simply have the investment, the resources, and the manpower. Because we have little investment and smaller teams, we are forced to create the technology that can deliver our ideas.'</p> <p>At 16, Hassabis co-created Theme Park with Peter Molyneux, as part of the company Lionhead. He says that it gave 'every player the chance to run their own Disneyland'. It became one of the biggest-selling games of all time, grossing around $60m. Consequently, he was offered a small fortune to develop another project but opted for a course in computer science at Cambridge.</p> <p>The workforce at companies like Elixir and Rebellion are an example of the rapidly increasing Oxbridge intake to an industry where it is becoming impossible to gain entry without a degree in something smart, as well as a passion for games. McDonagh is applying the knowledge absorbed during his history degree to the research for the content of Republic. 'The games industry in the UK can now compete with the City, which, historically, has taken all the best programmers and paid them 80 grand. The games industry was never able to do that. Now it can.'</p> <p>In Guildford, at the Surrey outpost of his empire Lionhead, where there is little for young Lionhead cubs to do lunchtimes but smoke and skateboard, Peter Molyneux is putting the finishing touches to Black &amp; White. The process began on Valentine's Day 1998. This, he says, is an indication of what games design does for the social and romantic lives of those who sign in to this world for a career. He has had four days off since the beginning of the century, and that includes working weekends. He is talking about how emotional he can become when explaining all that his team has achieved in creating Black &amp; White, and this pursuit of the contemporary and the real in a world of make-believe. 'There are as many programmers working on the eye of a character on a sports game as there are at Nasa,' he says.</p> <p>In Republic it will be possible to zoom in on the petals on the flowers in window boxes of buildings, cracks in the pavement, the scrolls around the spearheads of railings. In race games, it's now possible to compete in the virtual streets of London. When Molyneux talks of his process for creating God's creatures in Black &amp; White, it brings to mind the story that when da Vinci created the Mona Lisa, he began with the skull, the muscles, and then painted the face and skin. 'The other day we were working out how much a character's face should crease, how many eyelashes a character should have,' says Molyneux.

      "bodyText": "Whatever control you fail to exercise in the real world, it is yours, all yours, in the virtual world of the new computer game. In Black &amp; White you can literally be the skeletal hand of God, moving over the screen, pointing the finger of fate at any of your world's inhabitants. One click, one wave of the hand, and you can perform miracles. You might find a woman, broken, searching for her lost son. The son is hurt and dying in a forest. You can revive him, return him, and light up the lives of two lost souls. Or you can kill him, maybe set light to his mother's home, and destroy the village. Their fate is in your pixelated hand. In this world, you take control. You've got the power. Created in Britain, Black &amp; White is the electronic game that will take the genre into a new dimension, way beyond the likes of PlayStation 2, which launches later this month. The point of Black &amp; White is that it is more than a game. Players begin to care about this world. It immerses them like a book or a film, because it is not about competing or winning, it's about witnessing a story that you are creating. The British are lauded abroad as the most innovative games designers in the world. It's not a case of 'the British are coming' on this one - they've already arrived. The Japanese may have altered the image of the industry when Sony created PlayStation, the French and the Americans may have cornered the market as games publishers, but the British have the big ideas. The ideas that travel well and translate better. There are more design studios in the UK than anywhere else. Now the industry has been recognised with a label: Britsoft. Like Britpop, Britart or Britlit, Britsoft too has its stars: companies with names like Codemasters, Rare, Rebellion, Free Radical Design, Elixir, Lionhead. With the publication later this month of The Britsoft Book (\u00a350, ELSPA), the industry will be recognised as one of Britain's greatest exports. Peter Molyneux of Lionhead is described as the godfather of the Britsoft movement, and widely credited as the originator of the God-game genre. But never before has the player actually been cast in the role of God. Perhaps the closest was the brilliant The Sims from the mind of the American Will Wright. Its success? Its appeal to people who had never picked up a computer game - the mainstream audience that has become the Holy Grail for the creators of electronic games. The game led women and gay men, among others, into a realm of entertainment traditionally ghettoised as a boy's-own world of computerised dungeons, dragons, dwarves and goblins. The Sims jumpstarted the imagination of a thirtysomething breed entertained elsewhere by lifestyle spreads, home improvement, makeover shows, surveillance TV and soaps. Fundamentally, The Sims allowed you to create and control a family within a neighbourhood, send them to work, choose their wallpaper and keep them alive with regular visits to the fridge. The fact that Big Brother is to be transformed into a computer game smells like yesterday's news, coming six months after The Sims landed. But The Sims is a chunk of a bigger story. The God game has come to consume the thoughts of major players in the games industry, in a bid to capture the mainstream audience. More than anyone else, Molyneux has set his sights on bringing non-game players to consoles and computers. At one point during the making of Black &amp; White, Molyneux and his team (including a director and a cameraman) spent hours deciding how long it would take for a bead of sweat to roll down the cheek of a character. If computer games now call upon the skills of those in film, the detail applied to the imagery is as intricate as that which applies to painting, and the research for the content of a game almost as extensive as that for a weighty novel. When you look at the games world, it isn't difficult to understand why Japan, the US, Europe and currently the British government are taking a long, hard, excited look at Britsoft. As an industry, its sales this year surpassed that of video in the UK. It's almost level-pegging with the music industry in terms of revenue. Last year British exports in television totalled \u00a3444m. The leisure software industry came in at \u00a3503m. It is a far more significant export than the British film industry. For instance, it is rumoured that the film GoldenEye cost in the region of \u00a3100m to make and took a reputed \u00a3240m. Meanwhile, the computer game cost \u00a34m and notched up sales of \u00a3250m. Tomb Raider is currently being made into a film, with Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft, but the trend now is for the reversal of this process. Films are increasingly turning to electronic games designers to make the game before the film has barely been cast. The computer game for The Italian Job, for instance, has been completed before anyone has signed on the line for the planned film sequel. It's no wonder that another example of the increasing legitimacy of the British games business, and one that sees it blossoming from being 'the Cinderella of the entertainment industry', is its very own annual BAFTA ceremony. Molyneux was a member on the council that launched the awards. 'I remember thinking that these are the people who would have the answer to the question that I had wanted to answer. These people would know how to entertain people. I was just shocked that they didn't. And they viewed computer games with such a degree of suspicion. They didn't understand. I still don't think the full force of what computer entertainment is has been felt yet. But I think the tremors have.' It's true. The European software leisure market is currently estimated to be worth $6.27bn. Last year, the value of the UK market clocked out at close to \u00a31bn. Possibly the best example of the seismic impact of Britsoft in the global games market was illustrated by the Japanese company that built what it considered to be an English village in which to place its workforce so as to inspire the kind of games ideas that emerge from British minds. Actually, if Britsoft has a nerve centre, it has little in common with either a traditional, idyllic English village or the futuristic cityscapes of Blade Runner (a key influence in games designers' common culture, and as endemic as the artifacts that appear on the desks at their workstations: statuettes of Darth Vader, Austin Powers, jelly monsters, models of Bond-like cars, and slogans - 'I wish that I was where I am', 'Hit me baby one more time'). Leamington Spa seems to be the place where most of Britsoft's main companies have congregated. 'We started out working from two stables,' says David Darling. He founded Codemasters with his brother Richard. It now consumes most of a former farm somewhere near the M40, with outfits in France, Germany and the US. Not far away are the Oliver twins, who run Blitz games (about to launch Chicken Run), and the Stamper brothers at Rare. This last duo is perhaps the Barclay Brothers of the industry: rich workaholics who shun publicity. They emerged at a recent industry awards ceremony to collect their prize, saying nothing, with their faces concealed beneath Lone Ranger scarves. Nearby Oxford houses Rebellion, with the Kingsley brothers at the helm. In another neck of the woods, the Collier twins and the Pickfords. Brothers. All brothers. This is the common theme within Britsoft. It's odd, and perfect somehow, because even though games designers have long since ceased to be a breed apart, something to be avoided like Scientologists or drunks, you still, on meeting them, expect something strange to emerge. A tweedle-dee-tweedle-dumbness of the twins perhaps. A Disney tie. Brothers? It seems that as surely as solitary male adolescents disappeared to their bedrooms to masturbate or sniff glue, a boy and his brother hitting puberty in the mid-80s disappeared to their room in the hope of becoming computer programmers. Or rather, one would design and the other would programme. One would be attractive, the other would programme. And when you get beyond the fact that brothers seem to do this stuff extremely well, you wonder: why the British? 'The British have always been inventors, exploring new horizons, and computer games are part of those new horizons,' says Jason Kingsley, seated in a converted warehouse in a cobbled street in Oxford. Below, on the studio floor, there's the team that makes up Rebellion. All of whom are passionate gamesplayers, he says. Again, a stereotype is kicked into touch. Many of them look as though they could be moonlighting from club spreads in i-D and sleazenation. No sign of any arbiters of gothic chic or the Marilyn Manson disciples that emerge in the press when games are cited as the impetus for schoolyard massacres such as those in Kentucky and Colorado. According to Chris Kingsley, there is another reason that Britain is leading the way in games design: 'We've always had our mad inventors, like Clive Sinclair. For me, one of the great things about doing this is that it allows you to invent without all the bits. You can invent a programme for flight simulation without going out to build a plane.' All paths lead to Clive Sinclair, according to the leading lights of Britsoft. This was the ginger-haired genius who created the home computer on these shores with his little black box.

Programming for me was a godsend. I was very dyslexic. I couldn't draw or write, but I found I could be creative without those disciplines. I found my voice.' It was an apparatus that enabled boffins to programme as well as play, thereby becoming a computer experience exclusive to Britain. It was a culture that didn't exist elsewhere. What transpired was the equivalent of music-mad teenagers going to their rooms with three chords and a guitar and swelling into an underground movement. At the time, those of us outside of it - our brains stretched to capacity by the Rubik's cube - expected these boys to metamorphose into the kind of men who wear novelty socks and wax lyrical about loft insulation.

Not all of those who formed the nascent network that grew into Britsoft stayed the course. Some ducked out, one jumped from a tall building, another became a sheep farmer. But those that survived and prospered made it to the next level. They now command armies of artists, programmers, designers, and conquer worlds. And many of them are not yet 30. If the games industry were human, it would now be an adolescent male, which is why sex, girls and maturity are the things on its mind. The success of Lara Croft has sparked an abundance of Bond-like heroines with figures that are beginning to resemble a more realistic female form: Agent Archer (based on the looks of former L'Or\u00e9al model Mitzi Martin), Joanna Dark and the forthcoming Carmen Blake in Titanium Angels.

Black &amp; White is one of a number of games in development that deal with more cerebral themes, and even a level of morality on the part of the player. At Codemasters a game called The Realm attracts 49 per cent female players, according to David Darling. It's an online game, which is another direction in which the industry is headed. This marks its entry into another world of possibility, and the introduction of an offshoot industry that is expected to become massive. 'The online games are crossing the gender gap,' says Darling.

This stretch of time, anchored in tradition, challenges your patience, tolerance and secretly - come on admit it - confidence in your own sanity. Even the Buddha may have experienced the odd niggle had he been caught in the tussle to get a flight to Thailand.

This was because I spent an inordinate amount of time hiding there in a generally successful attempt to escape games lessons at the nearby boys' school where I was a pupil. We passed the hours cooking bacon and eggs over fires of twigs or teaching each other to smoke. And when the cross-country squad came too close for comfort, we pushed a little deeper into the undergrowth.</p> <p>In all those years, I never stumbled on to the manicured grounds of the Edgwarebury Hotel, which is curious considering just how close to the scene of my many crimes it is. And it is hardly what you would call an inconspicuous place. The Edgwarebury is a serious lump of mock Tudor.</p> <p>It is also a good place for Sunday lunch, in a sweetly old-fashioned sort of way. There is a marked provincialism about the place, given that it is so close to London. That is not meant to be a sniffy statement. In this modern age, provincialism is not so much a state of place as a state of mind, and it can be a deeply comforting one.</p> <p>Perhaps the defiantly unmodern feel of the place explains the age of the other diners, as it was full of well-heeled pensioners taking their parents out to lunch. We reckoned that our 14-month-old, Eddie, brought the average down to about 65. That said, no one seemed put out by Ed's initial lack of enthusiasm for being strapped into his high chair or his ability to lob a fresh strawberry 20 feet across the room. Repeatedly. (I blame the parents.)</p> <p>For all that, our deeply pleasurable lunch was occasionally in spite of the food. There is a three-course lunch menu on Sundays at \u00a318.95. My mother started with bruschetta, featuring a soft goat's cheese which was not, she said happily, too overwhelmingly goaty. The squid in my father's deep-fried squid salad was the right side of chewy, and Pat's smoked-chicken salad with a rich pesto dressing was fine. The duff note was my chilled melon with passion-fruit ice, which was not ripe enough.</p> <p>Of the main courses, the star was the perfectly caramelised braised lamb shank with rosemary and garlic, which my father and I tried, the meat tumbling off the bone. My mother thought her beef, served medium-rare, was 'fine', though perhaps could have done with being hung for a little longer before being shoved in the oven. Both dishes were let down by the roast potatoes. (It is a source of constant wonder to me that restaurants should be so appallingly bad at something so simple as roasting a potato. A roast potato should be crisp on the outside rather than flaccid, and soft on the inside rather than crumbly. Why can't they do it? Chefs can bone and stuff a grouse, fillet herrings, create souffl\u00e9s that defy gravity. But roast a potato adequately? Almost never.)</p> <p>The poorest of all the dishes was Pat's tagliatelli with wild mushrooms, truffles and Parmesan. The pasta was overcooked, the sauce watery and the flavouring distinctly shy. As to the puddings - fruit gateaux, cheesecake, etc - they were fine, but deserve little attention because they were bought-in rather than made on site.</p> <p>And yet, for all these gripes, the Rayner family had a jolly nice time.

Inhabitants of Scotland and Cornwall are best placed to take advantage of fresh supplies directly. Try royal warrant holder Ken Watmough (29 Thistle Street, Aberdeen; 01224 640 321) for just about any species in season, or Dennis Knight (1 Fore Street, Port Isaac, Cornwall; 01208 880 498) for fat, oily herrings and Fowey mussels.</p> <p>Thanks to mail order, however, there is no need to live on the coast. It may seem disconcerting at first buying fish without being able to see at first hand how fresh it is, but a couple of deliveries from a first-rate knowledgeable supplier will soon convince. Quayside Fish (The Harbourside, Porthleven, Cornwall; 01326 562 008) is a prime example. Either specify what you want, or take their advice: expect good sea bass and red mullet at around \u00a312.50 to \u00a313.50 per kg, and on no account miss the crab: large whole cock crabs (the best for white meat) weigh about 1.5kg and cost \u00a37.50 per kg; alternatively, buy the meat at around \u00a325 per kg (under half that for brown); add \u00a38.50 carriage, or \u00a312.50 for Saturday delivery. Autumn is the best time for fish because they are fattening up nicely for winter but have not yet begun to spawn, so it is a good moment to stock up the freezer, especially after a week of fine weather, when prices may drop a little. Quayside buys from day boats, and will freeze and despatch on the day it is landed, to be with you the following morning. Also ask about their smoked fish.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cornish-seafood.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Wing of St Mawes</a> (4 Warren Road, Indian Queens, St Columb, Cornwall; 0800 052 3717) is another clued-up supplier with an overnight delivery service. Their own boat operates out of St Mawes, and they buy at the morning auction in Newlyn, so there is no middleman. Ask for brill, Dover sole and monkfish, try John Dory for a change, or bag some large cod fillets while you still can. They also smoke and sweet-cure their own salmon, sourced from a small, chemical- and antibiotic-free farm on Loch Duart: buy a whole side (\u00a326 unsliced, \u00a330 sliced, including carriage). Robert Clifford-Wing is also a director of the wet fish shop and first-floor Seafood Caf\u00e9 at 6 Green Street, Bath.</p> <p>If the comparatively warm southwest is good for red mullet and John Dory, cold Scottish waters are ideal for a native mollusc, squid, which John MacCallum sells at \u00a34.50 per kg in his shop MacCallums of Troon (944 Argyle Street, Glasgow; 0141 204 4456). If you find squid too messy to deal with, they will clean them for you, but MacCallum is not a man for pre-packaged and plastic-wrapped food. He finds it normal that customers - on the continent or in South East Asia, for example - should buy their seafood whole and live where possible, and prepare it themselves: he keeps live oysters, lobsters and crabs in tanks at Troon. A live lobster at \u00a315 per kg sounds a good buy, and visitors to Troon can eat at MacCallums' Oyster Bar, The Harbour, Troon (01292 319 339).</p> <p>For lots of other suppliers, restaurants, fish and chip shops, smokeries and much more, see Rick Stein's Seafood Lovers' Guide (\u00a320, BBC), a chatty account of his fishy travels around the UK recently published to accompany the TV series.</p> <p>\u0095 Jim Ainsworth is editor of The Good Food Guide.</p>",

If the comparatively warm southwest is good for red mullet and John Dory, cold Scottish waters are ideal for a native mollusc, squid, which John MacCallum sells at \u00a34.50 per kg in his shop MacCallums of Troon (944 Argyle Street, Glasgow; 0141 204 4456). If you find squid too messy to deal with, they will clean them for you, but MacCallum is not a man for pre-packaged and plastic-wrapped food. He finds it normal that customers - on the continent or in South East Asia, for example - should buy their seafood whole and live where possible, and prepare it themselves: he keeps live oysters, lobsters and crabs in tanks at Troon. A live lobster at \u00a315 per kg sounds a good buy, and visitors to Troon can eat at MacCallums' Oyster Bar, The Harbour, Troon (01292 319 339). For lots of other suppliers, restaurants, fish and chip shops, smokeries and much more, see Rick Stein's Seafood Lovers' Guide (\u00a320, BBC), a chatty account of his fishy travels around the UK recently published to accompany the TV series. \u0095 Jim Ainsworth is editor of The Good Food Guide.",

Now, as the Sun celebrates 30 years' supremacy in the art form, nudity is a clich\u00e9; raunchy and aggressive 'girl power' bursts out of every women's magazine, probably even including the Lady, and passive, pouting page three girls seem as anachronistic as a saucy McGill postcard. Meanwhile, male pin-ups are also commonplace, and women don't pretend to worship George Clooney for his intellectual achievements. So, have we achieved a measure of equality after all, albeit only of both men and women increasingly judging each other on externalities? To the extent that there is still a page-three debate, it could be summarised as follows: Women: If you've got it, flaunt it. If you haven't, shut up or risk being called a humourless feminist. It's no big deal. Men: What's wrong with looking at a lovely female body? Most women would love to be a page three girl. And what about George Clooney?",

The suspected causes of the leaks were a defective wheel or blocked brakes, the magazine said. Then, it seemed, heat or sparks on the track ignited the oil.

But they said yesterday that examination of the substance, used to lubricate cables and ball bearings in the cable car system, had yielded no special clues. A safety expert told Focus that last weekend's fire may have spread more quickly because of small gas devices carried by skiers and snowboarders to heat wax before they head out on the slopes. Those killed in the accident included 92 Austrians; 37 Germans; 10 Japanese; eight Americans; four Slovenes; two Dutch, one Briton and one Czech. Austrians are still trying to come to terms with the tragedy, the country's worst involving winter holidaymakers. In the town of Wels, thousands of people, including weeping relatives of some of the dead, gathered in a sports hall, as the province that was home to many of the victims, Upper Austria, said a final farewell to them at an ecumenical church ceremony. Among the dead a week ago yesterday near the Alpine village of Kaprun, south of Salzburg, were 44 snowboarders and skiers from Upper Austria, the single largest number among the 92 Austrian victims. Thirty-two of them were from Wels. Mourners in the town's sports hall lit 44 candles on a stage covered with black cloth. Many of the relatives wept, and some were so upset that they had to leave. Several federal government ministers and other dignitaries were present. Repeating the theme of a memorial mass for all the victims, held in Salzburg a day earlier, Roman Catholic Bishop Maximilian Aichern said even the Bible could not answer the question 'why - why the tragedy had to happen. 'We pray for the relatives and friends of the victims of Kaprun, so that they have the strength to survive these hard days,' he said. In Salzburg on Friday, mourners placed a single red rose for each of the victims at the foot of a Baroque crucifix, while the Salzburg bishop compared the pain of those grieving for the dead with Christ's agony on the cross.

Nathan Hall, 21, was convicted of criminally negligent homicide in a court in Eagle, Colorado, and faces up to six years in prison. The accident took place in 1997 when Hall, who was working as a lift operator at the leading American resort of Vail, lost control skiing down the mountain and struck Alan Cobb, inflicting severe head injuries.

But a happy ending may at last be in sight.</p> <p>In a yarn that would have Hollywood's finest reaching for their cheque books, an elderly Finnish man in the Sixties left his native village shares in a small company that produced rubber boots.</p> <p>The company was Nokia - almost 40 years later it is the world's biggest manufacturer of mobile phones. The value of the shares has rocketed and they are now worth tens of millions of pounds.</p> <p>But the 2,000 inhabitants of Pukkila, 60 miles north of Helsinki, cannot agree on how the windfall should be spent and have wasted years arguing among themselves.</p> <p>In 1962 Onni Nurmi died, leaving the village 760 Nokia shares in his will. The legacy was then worth \u00a310,000 and he left instructions that the shares should never be sold.</p> <p>Instead he insisted that the annual dividends be spent on 'entertaining' the 25 or so elderly people in the village's modest yellow washboard nursing home.</p> <p>The sluggish pace of life in Pukkila, where many of the locals work the land, continued uninterrupted for the next 30 years. But in the mid-Nineties Nokia's diversification into mobile phones turned it into a global colossus. Suddenly the dusty Nokia shares were worth serious money.</p> <p>In 1997 the local council, anxious to protect its investment and all too aware of the extreme volatility of technology stocks, prepared to sell a third of the legacy, which at its peak last spring was worth some \u00a335 million.</p> <p>But not everyone was happy. Some villagers said Nurmi's last will and testament was not being respected. There were concerns that the council would spend the money on frivolous projects, including a swimming pool, leaving the village's old folk in the lurch.</p> <p>Others cannily pointed out that they would not need to pay taxes for 12 years if the windfall was poured into the council's budget.</p> <p>For a small hard core of residents, enough was enough and they launched legal action to stop the sale. The legal wrangling dragged on for three years and it was only in June that the case was wound up: the council won. Today things are calmer.</p> <p>Juha Myyrylainen, Pukkila's council leader, sits in a modest office overlooking the old people's home, monitoring the rise and fall of Nokia shares on his PC.</p> <p>Pukkila itself looks like any other Finnish village: low-slung red and white washboard houses with well-kept lawns are hemmed in by birch and pine tree forests and muddy fields.</p> <p>Myyrylainen talks cautiously about how the village will spend its windfall, and he is adamant the money will still be targeted exclusively on the elderly. 'We can invest the profits, make other investments and use the money for all kinds of care for old people. We can even build a new old people's home.'</p> <p>In the existing home, pensioners are grouped around a huge widescreen TV watching a soap opera. Each morning a nurse tells those who are interested how the shares are faring.</p> <p>The home has long been the envy of old people for miles around and there is a long waiting list to get in. In the dining room a portrait of Onni Nurmi takes pride of place. Little is known about him, except that he worked in America where he made his fortune before coming home to die.</p> <p>A foundation is now to be set up in his name to oversee the sale of his shares, which at today's market prices are worth around \u00a325m. It will meet for the first time tomorrow and Myyrylainen is likely to sit on its board.</p> <p>Residents are frustrated, he says, that the money has not been spent sooner. 'It does test the patience. It's been dragging on for too long and people want to see concrete results.'</p> <p>Profits from the shares were first spent on small items such as magazines and theatre trips, but have now been ploughed into extra staff for the nursing home as well as a minibus, special beds and other equipment.</p> <p>Myyrylainen says: 'The plan now is to build each and every one of the village's pensioners their own self-contained units in a new nursing home.'</p>",

But the 2,000 inhabitants of Pukkila, 60 miles north of Helsinki, cannot agree on how the windfall should be spent and have wasted years arguing among themselves. In 1962 Onni Nurmi died, leaving the village 760 Nokia shares in his will. The legacy was then worth \u00a310,000 and he left instructions that the shares should never be sold. Instead he insisted that the annual dividends be spent on 'entertaining' the 25 or so elderly people in the village's modest yellow washboard nursing home. The sluggish pace of life in Pukkila, where many of the locals work the land, continued uninterrupted for the next 30 years. But in the mid-Nineties Nokia's diversification into mobile phones turned it into a global colossus. Suddenly the dusty Nokia shares were worth serious money. In 1997 the local council, anxious to protect its investment and all too aware of the extreme volatility of technology stocks, prepared to sell a third of the legacy, which at its peak last spring was worth some \u00a335 million. But not everyone was happy. Some villagers said Nurmi's last will and testament was not being respected. There were concerns that the council would spend the money on frivolous projects, including a swimming pool, leaving the village's old folk in the lurch. Others cannily pointed out that they would not need to pay taxes for 12 years if the windfall was poured into the council's budget. For a small hard core of residents, enough was enough and they launched legal action to stop the sale. The legal wrangling dragged on for three years and it was only in June that the case was wound up: the council won. Today things are calmer. Juha Myyrylainen, Pukkila's council leader, sits in a modest office overlooking the old people's home, monitoring the rise and fall of Nokia shares on his PC. Pukkila itself looks like any other Finnish village: low-slung red and white washboard houses with well-kept lawns are hemmed in by birch and pine tree forests and muddy fields. Myyrylainen talks cautiously about how the village will spend its windfall, and he is adamant the money will still be targeted exclusively on the elderly. 'We can invest the profits, make other investments and use the money for all kinds of care for old people. We can even build a new old people's home.' In the existing home, pensioners are grouped around a huge widescreen TV watching a soap opera. Each morning a nurse tells those who are interested how the shares are faring. The home has long been the envy of old people for miles around and there is a long waiting list to get in. In the dining room a portrait of Onni Nurmi takes pride of place. Little is known about him, except that he worked in America where he made his fortune before coming home to die. A foundation is now to be set up in his name to oversee the sale of his shares, which at today's market prices are worth around \u00a325m. It will meet for the first time tomorrow and Myyrylainen is likely to sit on its board. Residents are frustrated, he says, that the money has not been spent sooner. 'It does test the patience. It's been dragging on for too long and people want to see concrete results.' Profits from the shares were first spent on small items such as magazines and theatre trips, but have now been ploughed into extra staff for the nursing home as well as a minibus, special beds and other equipment. Myyrylainen says: 'The plan now is to build each and every one of the village's pensioners their own self-contained units in a new nursing home.'",

A war of words fought across the pages of The New York Review of Books and the National Post features bitter accusations of betrayal and duplicity as vivid as any in Greene's fiction. The dispute between Yvonne Cloetta, Greene's mistress in his last 20 years, and Shirley Hazzard, an American writer who socialised with the couple, centres on Hazzard's recently published memoir, Greene on Capri. In the book, Hazzard, who was among the few people Greene socialised with while visiting his island house, describes the author as a curmudgeon whose life on Capri was a way of coping with boredom and black moods. She tells how he picked quarrels with friends with 'a playground will to hurt, humiliate and ridicule'. He developed a 'readiness to hurt even, or especially, those who were fond of him or wished him well' and 'evidence of the pain he caused gave reality to his own existence...' Writing to the New York Review of Books following a review of the book by author David Lodge, Cloetta rails at Hazzard, saying she and Greene 'fundamentally disliked each other but never dared admit it and played a kind of parody of friendship'. She claims Hazzard lacks any 'psychological intuition and is thus completely mistaken in her observations about Greene' in her 'cold little book'. Cloetta, who now lives in southern France, rebuffs Hazzard's claim that Greene disliked Capri and his house there, Villa Rosaio. As evidence of his meanness, Hazzard gave an example of Greene wishing to take a bus rather than a taxi home after dinner. Not so, says Cloetta. 'It was just an excuse to escape from her constant talking which he couldn't bear any longer.' Cloetta goes on: 'She claims he lacked tenderness, but I never found this to be true in the 32 years of closeness between us, and I feel pretty sure his friends - his real friends - would share my feelings.' In a reply to the literary journal, Hazzard accuses Cloetta of garbling her 'explicit words' in her eagerness for indignation. Hazzard denies suggesting Greene disliked Capri, that he was mean ['from time to time he chose to flourish frugality'] or lacked tenderness. She sought only to 'revisit and pay tribute to Greene in his restless engagement with life'. Hazzard accuses Cloetta ['Greene's self-appointed proprietress'] of duplicity - initially encouraging her to write a memoir 'by one who loved him and who he loved', then being behind a scathing review of her book under a pseudonym in Canada's National Post . In that review writer 'Judith Evans', accuses Hazzard of failing to exhibit 'a shred of human sympathy - as though to be human, a man must be faultless.

      "body": "<p>Like many young men, Kevin Challis was a dreamer. Growing up in the sedate surroundings of Bridport surrounded by a loving family, he looked beyond the rolling hills and beaches of Dorset to a life of adventure.</p> <p>Unlike many of his contemporaries, however, Kevin lived out his fantasy. While others settled down into office jobs, he moved to the Alps to carve out a life amid the peaks and snowfields.</p> <p>Last week, his image was flashed around the world and printed in newspapers from Manchester to Melbourne. His poignant story had resonance beyond the horrific tragedy of the Kitzsteinhorn ski train: it was also about one man's search for contentment in the world, and the fact that he had died when he had finally found it.</p> <p>The irony is not lost on his widow Christl. The view from her bedroom window is dominated by the stunning 10,500ft Kitzsteinhorn glacier, where she first met Kevin in 1991. Last Saturday, the 40-year old ski instructor was on his way to the glacier, the place he loved, when he died in Europe's worst winter sports disaster. His daughter, Siobhan, later told her mother how he had given up his seat on the Alpine train to an elderly man, telling her he would come on the next one and meet her at the top.</p> <p>As she waved to him, the eight-year old was unaware it was the last time she would see her father, whom she liked to call 'the funniest man on Earth'.</p> <p>'That's where it all began, and that's where it all finished, I suppose,' said Christl, also a ski instructor, as she gazed at the snow-covered mountain, cloaked in grey cloud.</p> <p>But, in truth, Kevin's love for the mountains and the thrills they promised had begun a lot earlier. His father Roy, 68, brought him up to cherish the outdoors, teaching him to swim in the sea when he was just a toddler. He loved sport from the moment he could walk. Though he found school lessons boring, he played football and cricket for local teams and swam at least once a week. During the summer he would plunge into the waves almost every day.</p> <p>'He was a bit of a daredevil. He just loved to be active and doing something adventurous,' Roy said. He was also a determined young man and had fierce loyalties. While his brothers and father supported local football team Southampton, Kevin was enticed by Brian Clough's Derby County. Even after the club lost its winning ways - and its maverick manager - his loyalty to them never wavered.</p> <p>Kevin's wild and rash streak was a trait that occasionally got him into trouble. His father remembers him constantly getting told off at his Sea Scout troop. If there was a canoeing trip, Kevin would forget to put on his helmet; if they were sailing he would be caught without a lifejacket. Keeping him in line was at times difficult, but with a smile and a joke Kevin would somehow always avoid serious punishment.</p> <p>The key moment in all his high jinks occurred, however, in Yeovil. A trip to the dry-skiing slope there at the age of 12 saw him catch the skiing bug after a single lesson. From then on, skiing was to be his sporting passion and the outlet for all his adventurous desires.</p> <p>He left school at 16, taking a job as an apprentice bricklayer with a friend of his father's. He began to live like a carefree man-about-town with money in his pocket and a desire to have as much fun in Dorset's pubs and clubs as possible. Four years later, aged 20, he joined his father's building firm like his two brothers John and Michael. All seemed well, but Kevin had never lost that passion for skiing. His trips to the slope at Yeovil became weekly jaunts and he picked up some qualifications as an instructor. He soon realised that it was in the Alps that his dreams lay. Aged 28, he quit his job and moved to France with the aim of becoming a professional ski instructor.</p> <p>In 1991 he journeyed to Austria as an instructor for a group of teenagers on a ten-day tour. Almost immediately a chance meeting on the slopes changed his life. Christl remembers it still, though at first she was not impressed by the brash young man from the West Country. 'When I first saw him on the glacier, I didn't think too much of him,' admits the 39-year old.</p> <p>But Kevin was undeterred. A few days later he asked her to go for a drink and waited patiently for her to finish her afternoon shift in the ski school office. They left together in the cable car and for the next few days rarely left each other's side. When Kevin's trip finished he promised a sceptical Christl he would return as soon as possible. 'I just thought, \"Oh yeah\". But he did - 14 days later. He brought all his stuff on the bus, including his ironing board and iron, and whatever he might need,' she said.</p> <p>Christl was taken aback by her suitor's zeal.'I wasn't that desperate to live with somebody,' she said 'I travelled a lot, and had my own life. I couldn't imagine to live with the same person, eat with the same person every day, speak to the same person every day. But it turned out okay.' She laughs gently. 'It didn't get boring. No, with us it didn't get boring... no... never...'</p> <p>Three weeks after his arrival, she discovered she was pregnant. They married six months later. That was how Kevin Challis unexpectedly swept into Christl's life. 'I'm just glad for those 10 years,' she said.</p> <p>Now Christl knows she will never look upon Kevin's rugged face again. His charred remains have been recovered from the two-mile mountain tunnel leading to the glacier where an inferno snatched the lives of 155 skiers and snow-boarders in minutes. He is thought to have escaped from the burning train through a window, but was then overcome by the toxic fumes as he tried to run up the stairs.</p> <p>Salvage workers have told the relatives of victims that the remains of their loved ones are a distressing sight: faces, noses, eyes and ears have melted, while other corpses have been reduced to little more than ashes. The remains are being painstakingly sifted through by pathologists in Salzburg who are DNA-testing them for identification.</p> <p>Christl has handed over her husband's toothbrush to scientists so that they can make the correct match. She is not ready yet, she says, to face the details of what happened in the accident, but of one thing she is very clear: she will not see his remains. 'No, no, I don't want to see it. He was a beautiful man, and I'd rather keep him like that.' Her short laugh turns into a deep sigh.</p> <p>In Kaprun everything is upside down. The tourists have left the resort, their beds taken over by the world's media, and for the past few days a strong wind has wrapped the town of 3,000 souls in a blanket of unsettlingly warm air. Flowers are starting to bloom - although it's the start of the winter ski season.</p> <p>Like the daily routines of many of the children in the town who have lost fathers, brothers, teachers and ski-instructors, Siobhan's life has been turned upside down. Most of the time, according to her mother, she is putting on a brave face. 'She is sleeping with me, and during the day when she has her moments, she comes to me and cries and we talk about it. When she's in a good mood I let her be... I'm sure that Kevin will be more happy that she laughs and giggles with her friends than if she goes to church and cries, because there'll be enough times when she cries.</p> <p>'This morning she said to me \"without Papa I don't want to live\". I comforted her and told her that Papa was here with us and that we had to get on with our lives together. 'She turned to me and said \"but Mama, you're not as funny as Papa was\".' Humour, in fact, had always been one of Kevin's strengths. In Austria, as in Bridport, he was always the life and soul of the party and it helped win the locals over to accepting a foreigner into their tight-knit Alpine community. The house they created together was quickly filled with totems of their love. Wedding and skiing photographs were plastered on the fridge, a red love-heart with 'Kevin' scrawled through it is still stuck on the fridge door.</p> <p>But life was not all easy. Kevin had already escaped death seven months earlier when 11 of his ski-instructor friends were swallowed by an avalanche as they skied down the Kitzsteinhorn. Kevin had been due to join them until a last-minute change of plan forced him to drop out. Their deaths affected him badly.</p> <p>Money was also tight and in the summer months both of them did odd-jobs to make ends meet. Christl too had her own brush with tragedy. Five years ago while visiting a local golf course with Kevin - an eight-handicap player - a golf ball struck from the tee shot straight into her left eye, which she lost as a result.</p> <p>However, living the dream was still all that mattered. Yet all that ended a week ago. Christl drove her daughter and husband up to the train early in the morning and then returned home. She listened to some music and then left to visit a friend. As she walked she heard a fire alarm and saw fleets of ambulances racing past. At first she was not worried. She had taken Kevin and Siobhan to the train early and was convinced any accident must have happened long after they had reached the top.She was only right about her daughter - Kevin was already dead.</p> <p>Just to check, Christl rang a friend already on the slopes on her mobile phone. She told her that Siobhan was right next to her alive and well, but that Kevin was on the train. 'Then I think I started to scream,' she said.</p> <p>Siobhan was brought down at 3.30 by the gondola. By then Christl had already given up hope. 'Siobhan, Kevin is dead,' she told her her daughter. 'Siobhan had sort of expected it because when she was at the top she saw the black smoke pouring out of the Alpine centre, and her daddy never came,' she said.</p> <p>Kevin's death ended his dream just as he was finally showing signs of calming his urge for adventure. It was a change that Kevin's father had noticed too. In August Kevin and his family had spent a holiday in Bridport and Roy had never seen his son more at ease. 'I had never really thought he would be happy as a family man, but he really was. He was so content with his life. I almost couldn't believe it,' he said. But some of the old Kevin was still there. Lounging on the beach near where he had learnt to swim, Kevin suddenly jumped up and put on his wife's bikini bottoms. He then ran into the sea. Roy could not help but follow him. 'It was the first time I had been swimming in the sea in years, but it was such a funny thing for him to do, very typical of his sense of fun,' he said.</p> <p>In his life, Kevin won friends across the world. Christl has had calls from as far afield as South Africa. But nothing can change the fact Kevin is gone. There is now only a burial left to close the chapter on the life of an ordinary man who lived out extraordinary dreams.</p> <p>Her Englishman will be buried in the cemetery on the hill, Christl says, with a grand view of the mountains he loved so much. 'Maybe in six months' time, I'll want to know every detail of what's happened,' she says, 'but for now I have to separate the life from the tragedy, because the life was beautiful and the catastrophe was ugly and horrific.'</p>",

His charred remains have been recovered from the two-mile mountain tunnel leading to the glacier where an inferno snatched the lives of 155 skiers and snow-boarders in minutes. He is thought to have escaped from the burning train through a window, but was then overcome by the toxic fumes as he tried to run up the stairs. Salvage workers have told the relatives of victims that the remains of their loved ones are a distressing sight: faces, noses, eyes and ears have melted, while other corpses have been reduced to little more than ashes. The remains are being painstakingly sifted through by pathologists in Salzburg who are DNA-testing them for identification. Christl has handed over her husband's toothbrush to scientists so that they can make the correct match. She is not ready yet, she says, to face the details of what happened in the accident, but of one thing she is very clear: she will not see his remains. 'No, no, I don't want to see it. He was a beautiful man, and I'd rather keep him like that.' Her short laugh turns into a deep sigh. In Kaprun everything is upside down. The tourists have left the resort, their beds taken over by the world's media, and for the past few days a strong wind has wrapped the town of 3,000 souls in a blanket of unsettlingly warm air. Flowers are starting to bloom - although it's the start of the winter ski season. Like the daily routines of many of the children in the town who have lost fathers, brothers, teachers and ski-instructors, Siobhan's life has been turned upside down. Most of the time, according to her mother, she is putting on a brave face. 'She is sleeping with me, and during the day when she has her moments, she comes to me and cries and we talk about it. When she's in a good mood I let her be... I'm sure that Kevin will be more happy that she laughs and giggles with her friends than if she goes to church and cries, because there'll be enough times when she cries. 'This morning she said to me \"without Papa I don't want to live\". I comforted her and told her that Papa was here with us and that we had to get on with our lives together. 'She turned to me and said \"but Mama, you're not as funny as Papa was\".' Humour, in fact, had always been one of Kevin's strengths. In Austria, as in Bridport, he was always the life and soul of the party and it helped win the locals over to accepting a foreigner into their tight-knit Alpine community. The house they created together was quickly filled with totems of their love. Wedding and skiing photographs were plastered on the fridge, a red love-heart with 'Kevin' scrawled through it is still stuck on the fridge door. But life was not all easy. Kevin had already escaped death seven months earlier when 11 of his ski-instructor friends were swallowed by an avalanche as they skied down the Kitzsteinhorn. Kevin had been due to join them until a last-minute change of plan forced him to drop out. Their deaths affected him badly. Money was also tight and in the summer months both of them did odd-jobs to make ends meet. Christl too had her own brush with tragedy. Five years ago while visiting a local golf course with Kevin - an eight-handicap player - a golf ball struck from the tee shot straight into her left eye, which she lost as a result. However, living the dream was still all that mattered. Yet all that ended a week ago. Christl drove her daughter and husband up to the train early in the morning and then returned home. She listened to some music and then left to visit a friend. As she walked she heard a fire alarm and saw fleets of ambulances racing past. At first she was not worried. She had taken Kevin and Siobhan to the train early and was convinced any accident must have happened long after they had reached the top.She was only right about her daughter - Kevin was already dead. Just to check, Christl rang a friend already on the slopes on her mobile phone. She told her that Siobhan was right next to her alive and well, but that Kevin was on the train. 'Then I think I started to scream,' she said. Siobhan was brought down at 3.30 by the gondola. By then Christl had already given up hope. 'Siobhan, Kevin is dead,' she told her her daughter. 'Siobhan had sort of expected it because when she was at the top she saw the black smoke pouring out of the Alpine centre, and her daddy never came,' she said. Kevin's death ended his dream just as he was finally showing signs of calming his urge for adventure. It was a change that Kevin's father had noticed too. In August Kevin and his family had spent a holiday in Bridport and Roy had never seen his son more at ease. 'I had never really thought he would be happy as a family man, but he really was. He was so content with his life. I almost couldn't believe it,' he said. But some of the old Kevin was still there. Lounging on the beach near where he had learnt to swim, Kevin suddenly jumped up and put on his wife's bikini bottoms. He then ran into the sea. Roy could not help but follow him. 'It was the first time I had been swimming in the sea in years, but it was such a funny thing for him to do, very typical of his sense of fun,' he said. In his life, Kevin won friends across the world. Christl has had calls from as far afield as South Africa. But nothing can change the fact Kevin is gone. There is now only a burial left to close the chapter on the life of an ordinary man who lived out extraordinary dreams. Her Englishman will be buried in the cemetery on the hill, Christl says, with a grand view of the mountains he loved so much. 'Maybe in six months' time, I'll want to know every detail of what's happened,' she says, 'but for now I have to separate the life from the tragedy, because the life was beautiful and the catastrophe was ugly and horrific.'",

And Parker has put his principles into practice: he owns a micro-winery in Oregon which is run on similarly small-scale lines.</p> <p>This April Parker found himself at war with the wine establishment in Bordeaux after writing about Bordeaux's business side and the global glut in its wines. He argued that the retail trade worldwide would have to cut its losses by dumping the 1997s en masse and sceptically judging each wine from 1998. Then, while scolding the Bordeaux producers for their 'egregious blunder' and foolish greed, he called for a reduction in the prices for the 1999 wines by 30 per cent. He wrote: 'If arrogance prevents them from understanding this, they will see the irresponsibility of their ways...sooner rather than later.'</p> <p>The Bordeaux establishment attacked Parker in the local press, accusing him of cronyism and, by innuendo, of malice. They realised the April issue of The Wine Advocate was going to cost them dear.</p> <p>While the leading chateaux have financial reserves to ride out a downturn, they need Parker's tough-minded criticisms like a hole in the head. Still less do they want him proselytising in favour of the 'garagistes', the winemakers who seem to be shaking the region out of its complacency. So when Parker flies in to wrap his gums round the plums of the new vintage that Bordeaux winemakers have been getting so excited about, more than a few winemakers will be awaiting his reaction with trepidation. When Robert M. Parker Jr spits, people take notice.</p> <p><b>Winning wines</b></p> <p>Robert Parker's selections of reds from the November 2000 issue of the Wine Advocate</p> <p><b> Domaine Des Amouriers 1999 </b> <br><b>Vacqueyras Les Genestes </b></p> <p>Rated : 90/100</p> <p>This has long been one of my favourite Vacqueyras properties as well as a reference point for the appellation.

The Bordeaux establishment attacked Parker in the local press, accusing him of cronyism and, by innuendo, of malice. They realised the April issue of The Wine Advocate was going to cost them dear. While the leading chateaux have financial reserves to ride out a downturn, they need Parker's tough-minded criticisms like a hole in the head. Still less do they want him proselytising in favour of the 'garagistes', the winemakers who seem to be shaking the region out of its complacency. So when Parker flies in to wrap his gums round the plums of the new vintage that Bordeaux winemakers have been getting so excited about, more than a few winemakers will be awaiting his reaction with trepidation. When Robert M. Parker Jr spits, people take notice. Winning wines Robert Parker's selections of reds from the November 2000 issue of the Wine Advocate Domaine Des Amouriers 1999 Vacqueyras Les Genestes Rated : 90/100 This has long been one of my favourite Vacqueyras properties as well as a reference point for the appellation. The opaque purple/black-coloured 1999 offers a gorgeous bouquet of roasted herbs, grilled meats, blackberries, and smoke. Full-bodied, with supple tannin and loads of concentration. Anticipated maturity: 2001-2012. Domaine De La Days\u00e9e (J. Meffre) 1998 Gigondas Rated : 90/100 An impressive, highly concentrated, intense effort, this 1998 offers a saturated purple colour, and pure blackberry liqueur aromas intermixed with cherries, smoke, minerals, and earth. It will drink well for 12-15 years. Domaine Les Grands Bois 1998 Cotes Du Rh\u00f4ne Villages Cuv\u00e9e Gabrielle Rated : 87/100 A new discovery for me. Proprietor Marc Besnardeau has turned out a delicious, unfiltered wine produced from a blend of two-thirds Grenache and one-third Syrah. Notes of raspberry liqueur, cherries, and fraises des bois. It should drink well for two to three years, but why wait?",

But by the time you reach your seventies or eighties, falling over is probably one of the events you fear most. </p> <p>About 40 per cent of people going into old people's homes do so after a fall. For many people, particularly women, bone density has decreased to such an extent by old age that a slip can easily lead to a fracture. And a broken hip or arm can frequently trigger a chain of events which end up in institutionalisation. </p> <p>But it does not have to be this way. Many older people fight to stay in their own home. Crucial to the outcome is the way those people - or their relatives - handle discussions with GPs, hospitals and social services. </p> <p> <strong> Hospital assessments</strong> </p> <p> If you end up in hospital, you should ensure that you get a 'hospital assessment' before you leave. This is your 'route to after-care services', says Stephen Lowe of Age Concern. This is where you will discuss the provision ofhome helps, for instance, meals on wheels, future medical and nursing re quirements, rehabilitation and any equipment or adaptations you may need, including wheelchairs or handrails. Don't let the hospital discharge you without an assessment - as many try to do if they are under pressure for space. </p> <p> <strong> GP consultations</strong> </p> <p> If your fall was not bad enough to take you to hospital, your route to other care services comes through your GP. Ask the doctor for a social services assessment from the local authority. Getting an assessment is crucial - even if you end up paying some or all of the help and services you receive yourself. By assessing you, social services will be accepting that they have some responsibility for you. </p> <p> <strong> Who foots the bill - NHS, social services or you?</strong> </p> <p> This is a very confused - but critical - issue. If you continue to be the responsibility of the National Health Service after discharge, your treatment is free. So if you go back for out-patient treatment you do not have to pay. Or if you are in a rehabilitation unit under the auspices of the NHS, that is free. </p> <p>Individual health authorities set their own criteria for 'continuing care'. Most of this care will be specialist in nature, rather than something a well-trained home help could provide. But as Lowe says: 'If you have a fall, you are likely to come under social services.' This means, in nearly all authorities, that you will be means-tested for the cost of home helps or other services. </p> <p>Your home will be excluded from the means-test if you continue to live there, but the local authority may insist on your making a contribution. If you go into a home, your property could be taken into account - as will assets over \u00a310,000. </p> <p> <strong> Claiming benefits</strong> </p> <p> You may be able to claim Attendance Allowance or other benefits if your health deteriorates to the extent that you need assistance. Attendance Allowance - a non-taxable benefit - can provide up to \u00a353.55 a week. </p> <p> <strong> Complaints - often the best way out</strong> </p> <p> Since many local authorities are under huge financial pressures, they often provide a very poor service to the elderly. This means that to get treated well you often have to create a fuss. Elderly people who have articulate relatives to fight their cause will usu ally fare better than a lonely old man with Alzheimer's. Lowe warns that local authorities often 'draw out' the first informal stage of a complaints procedure, where there are no time limits within which the authority is expected to sort out the problem. 'Once you get past that stage there are time limits,' he says. 'So once you have attempted to resolve the issue, you may want to tell them that the first stage is exhausted.' </p> <p> <strong> Enduring power of attorney</strong> </p> <p> Set up an 'enduring power of attorney' (EPOA) even before you become unwell - but avoid arranging a 'power of attorney', warns the Alzheimer's Society. You can keep the EPOA document in a drawer and ask your relatives to enforce it only if you become temporarily or permanently unable to manage your affairs. While a POA gives away your right to control your affairs immediately, an EPOA becomes effective only if it needs to be used. </p> <p>Many people who have a fall or operation have a short-term period of confusion. It will be far less stressful for their relatives if someone else can easily take charge of bills and other financial decisions. Harry Cayton of the Alzheimer's Association recommends against paying regular bills by cash or cheque: 'Pay by direct debit or standing order. If you go into hospital, nobody has to worry about your electricity being cut off.' </p> <p> <strong> Free sources of help</strong> </p> <p> Citizens' advice bureaux regularly advise the elderly on community care and benefits. <a href=\"http://www.ageconcern.org.uk\">Age Concern</a> (0800 009 966) has a series of free factsheets.

'It was like stuffing it down a manhole,' he says.</p> <p> Some 20 years after Dollar (remember the diminutive duo singing 'Mirror mirror' and 'Give me back my heart') wound up, Van Day can be found in Brighton, selling hamburgers, doughnuts and ice creams. Most of the 'several million pounds' that he earned as a pop star has gone. 'I know it's not as glamorous and people probably see it as sad, but I can't do anything about that,' he says. </p> <p> Van Day is currently starring in a new Virgin TV ad campaign that focuses on his financial downfall. In the advert, he is asked if he could have done with financial advice. 'You bettcha,' he replies. </p> <p> But he admits that plenty of people tried to advise him at the time. 'I wasn't interested. When you are that young and famous, you don't think it's going to stop. You don't think about getting money into a pension.' </p> <p> And although he has cultivated the impression of being a financial ignoramus for the sake of the advert, he is actually quite astute. Ten years ago he did a life insurance sales course. 'I now know it's one of the hardest things to sell,' he says. </p> <p> Perhaps this is why he has ended up with a 'few endowments which will hopefully pay off the mortgage'. </p> <p> But his properties have undoubtedly been his most successful investments. He bought a flat in Brighton five years ago for \u00a3140,000 and sold it a few years later privately through a newspaper for \u00a3225,000. His home in Hove Park, bought for \u00a3250,000, was recently valued at \u00a3500,000. Though his fans may frown on his catering businesses, their profit potential is promising. The ice cream business alone sold \u00a31,200-\u00a31,500 of stock a week this summer, at a 60 per cent profit. And, as he points out, he's not the first pop idol to enter the world of food - Bill Wyman has his Sticky Fingers burger restaurant in Kensington. </p> <p> Van Day also makes a tidy sum from the cabaret circuit, appearing as part of Bucks Fizz with one of the band's original members, Mike Nolan. This work has spurred an interest in the stock market. 'I read the financial pages because I need to know what the main leisure groups are up to - anything that may affect people who book us.'</p> <p> The duo are paid \u00a32,000 a night, part of which they pay to two women singers who complete the line-up. He also books acts to appear at venues. The only grit in the oyster is a legal battle that Van Day and Nolan are currently fighting against Nolan's former partner, Bobby G, who is also claiming the right to use the Bucks Fizz trademark. Their legal costs have already risen to \u00a350,000, and the case is likely to continue for another nine months. </p> <p> Van Day seems quite comfortably off for someone who is meant to be on his uppers. His daughters, Olivia and Amber, are both in a local private school, and have ballet and piano lessons, while his wife Maria, a former model, is now a housewife. But the trappings of rock and roll stardom are gone. Instead of a limousine, he gets around in a four-wheel drive or a Rover diesel. 'It's boring, but it does the mileage around the country'. </p> <p> He says he doesn't miss the money or the lifestyle, but adds: 'If I had the money I'd spend it even quicker. I would do it all again.'</p>",

His home in Hove Park, bought for \u00a3250,000, was recently valued at \u00a3500,000. Though his fans may frown on his catering businesses, their profit potential is promising. The ice cream business alone sold \u00a31,200-\u00a31,500 of stock a week this summer, at a 60 per cent profit. And, as he points out, he's not the first pop idol to enter the world of food - Bill Wyman has his Sticky Fingers burger restaurant in Kensington. Van Day also makes a tidy sum from the cabaret circuit, appearing as part of Bucks Fizz with one of the band's original members, Mike Nolan. This work has spurred an interest in the stock market. 'I read the financial pages because I need to know what the main leisure groups are up to - anything that may affect people who book us.' The duo are paid \u00a32,000 a night, part of which they pay to two women singers who complete the line-up. He also books acts to appear at venues. The only grit in the oyster is a legal battle that Van Day and Nolan are currently fighting against Nolan's former partner, Bobby G, who is also claiming the right to use the Bucks Fizz trademark. Their legal costs have already risen to \u00a350,000, and the case is likely to continue for another nine months. Van Day seems quite comfortably off for someone who is meant to be on his uppers. His daughters, Olivia and Amber, are both in a local private school, and have ballet and piano lessons, while his wife Maria, a former model, is now a housewife. But the trappings of rock and roll stardom are gone. Instead of a limousine, he gets around in a four-wheel drive or a Rover diesel. 'It's boring, but it does the mileage around the country'. He says he doesn't miss the money or the lifestyle, but adds: 'If I had the money I'd spend it even quicker. I would do it all again.'",

You can get not only tax relief, but a Government top-up, too. </p> <p>The issue attracted fresh controversy this month, when Cabinet Office Minister Mo Mowlam launched the Change a Life campaign, aimed at ending cash donations to beggars on the street and redirecting donations to charities. </p> <p>Many people dislike the approach: if the whole of the public followed its example, many beggars would have to go into homes, giving up their dogs and giving up drinking (nearly all hostels are 'dry'). </p> <p>So, if you want to maintain their personal liberty, you can continue donating directly, or support a charity such as Shelter, which has declined to take part in the campaign, believing people of the street will be stigmatised. Shelter is sending out a mailshot to 800,000 people this week. Or you could ring 0207 505 2086 or visit <a href=\"http://www.shelter.org.uk\">www.shelter.org.uk</a>.</p> <p>Alternatively, if you support Change a Life, telephone 0845 60 61 623 or visit <a href=\"http://www.changealife.org.uk\">www.changealife.org.uk</a>.</p> <p>You can offer your time to a homeless charity that supports the campaign (your details will be fed into a database and matched up with a local organisation) or offer gifts such as an old TV set or some cast-off clothes. The final option through Change a Life is to give money. This cash will be split between four charities: Centrepoint, Crisis, the National Homeless Alliance and the Salvation Army. </p> <p>You will be asked if you want to give through Gift Aid, a tax-efficient donations scheme through which the charity can get basic-rate tax relief of 22 per cent on top of your contribution. The Government will add another 10 per cent. </p> <p>A good way to give at any time is through Give As You Earn.

      "bodyText": "However you feel about the Government's drive to stop people giving money directly to beggars, you can increase the worth of your donation to good causes by up to 83 per cent by planning your gifts. You can get not only tax relief, but a Government top-up, too. The issue attracted fresh controversy this month, when Cabinet Office Minister Mo Mowlam launched the Change a Life campaign, aimed at ending cash donations to beggars on the street and redirecting donations to charities. Many people dislike the approach: if the whole of the public followed its example, many beggars would have to go into homes, giving up their dogs and giving up drinking (nearly all hostels are 'dry'). So, if you want to maintain their personal liberty, you can continue donating directly, or support a charity such as Shelter, which has declined to take part in the campaign, believing people of the street will be stigmatised. Shelter is sending out a mailshot to 800,000 people this week. Or you could ring 0207 505 2086 or visit www.shelter.org.uk. Alternatively, if you support Change a Life, telephone 0845 60 61 623 or visit www.changealife.org.uk. You can offer your time to a homeless charity that supports the campaign (your details will be fed into a database and matched up with a local organisation) or offer gifts such as an old TV set or some cast-off clothes. The final option through Change a Life is to give money. This cash will be split between four charities: Centrepoint, Crisis, the National Homeless Alliance and the Salvation Army. You will be asked if you want to give through Gift Aid, a tax-efficient donations scheme through which the charity can get basic-rate tax relief of 22 per cent on top of your contribution. The Government will add another 10 per cent. A good way to give at any time is through Give As You Earn. You donate a set amount each month from your salary to one of the country's 180,000 charities. The charity gets the basic-rate tax relief and the 10 per cent Government top-up. If you are a higher-rate taxpayer, you can claim back 18 per cent - the difference between the 40 and 22 per cent tax rates.",

      "body": "<p>My flat was burgled almost two years ago. It was quite a neat job: no personal insults daubed on the wall; the cats left untortured. </p> <p>This was Hackney, in east London, where it was not unusual to meet a police cordon on the way home from work as a result of yet another an armed siege, so although the burglary was upsetting, I thought I was lucky it hadn't been worse. </p> <p>The thieves took my laptop containing five years of freelance work; someone, somewhere is making good use of my old passport and I still haven't replaced my natty little Sony shortwave radio. </p> <p>I called the police and two officers from nearby Shoreditch station took fingerprints and a statement. I was not optimistic that they would retrieve anything, and so it has turned out. But I knew I would need a crime number for insurance purposes. </p> <p>The last thing I was concerned about was my rented video recorder. I'd signed an insurance agreement with the Granada showroom when I hired it and that, I thought, would be enough. I reported the loss to the local branch and left it at that. </p> <p>Then, last May, I received a letter from Granada Home Technology saying it had come to their attention that I was no longer paying for my video by direct debit so I faced an extra charge for paying by cash. I phoned to explain that the equipment had been stolen 18 months previously, and was told it would be sorted out. </p> <p>A month later I received my first letter from Granada's credit control department with the photocopied signature of Georgina Richards at the bottom. Over the months that followed I would get to know the squeezed-up, mean-looking lines of that signature very well. </p> <p>After July's missive, with my outstanding bill standing at a modest \u00a322.36, I confirmed the date of the theft and the crime number with the police, and passed them to the credit control department. Again, I was told that it would be sorted out and that I could apply for a repayment of any extra direct debits I had paid after the machine was stolen. </p> <p>Yet on 29 August, Georgina started playing hardball. Unless she heard from me within 48 hours she would 'apply for a Default Notice to be served under Section 87 (1) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974'. A week later, the notice arrived with a warning that if I didn't pay the outstanding balance, which had then risen to \u00a361.08, 'we shall take all the necessary steps to recover ALL [sic] monies due from you together with ALL legal costs.' </p> <p>This was beginning to get scary so I phoned again. I asked: 'Don't you think it seems a little unfair to expect me to continue to pay for a video that was stolen from me two years ago.' </p> <p>The call centre operator said: 'Our records say you owe us the money.' </p> <p>Me: 'Are you seriously saying you will take me to court for payments on a piece of equipment that the police know has been stolen?' </p> <p>'It's not my decision,' he said. </p> <p>I was told to report the theft to a Granada show- room - something I had done two years earlier. I said I didn't see why I had to go through the process again. This, I later discovered, was registered on my Granada file as an outright refusal to report the theft. </p> <p>In October things started to get really heavy. Granada had passed the account to the TSR Debt Recovery Service, which demanded \u00a3272.47 to cover the outstanding payments and the cost of the stolen machine. At the end of the month, a firm of solicitors, JM O'Connor, warned me by letter that it was applying for a county court summons. My goods could be seized to recover the money owed, my pay taken from my employer or cash grabbed direct from my bank account. </p> <p>Last week, I decided to ring the Granada press office to see if this was usual procedure. The company has recently merged with Radio Rentals to become Box Clever, with a turnover of \u00a34 billion. I asked if the company had a policy of persecuting people who had made the mistake of having their video recorders stolen. </p> <p>I had spotted that the solicitors O'Connor and TSR Debt Recovery were both based at 239 Ampthill Road, Bedford, which just happens to be the headquarters of Granada Home Technology.

      "bodyText": "My flat was burgled almost two years ago. It was quite a neat job: no personal insults daubed on the wall; the cats left untortured. This was Hackney, in east London, where it was not unusual to meet a police cordon on the way home from work as a result of yet another an armed siege, so although the burglary was upsetting, I thought I was lucky it hadn't been worse. The thieves took my laptop containing five years of freelance work; someone, somewhere is making good use of my old passport and I still haven't replaced my natty little Sony shortwave radio. I called the police and two officers from nearby Shoreditch station took fingerprints and a statement. I was not optimistic that they would retrieve anything, and so it has turned out. But I knew I would need a crime number for insurance purposes. The last thing I was concerned about was my rented video recorder. I'd signed an insurance agreement with the Granada showroom when I hired it and that, I thought, would be enough. I reported the loss to the local branch and left it at that. Then, last May, I received a letter from Granada Home Technology saying it had come to their attention that I was no longer paying for my video by direct debit so I faced an extra charge for paying by cash. I phoned to explain that the equipment had been stolen 18 months previously, and was told it would be sorted out. A month later I received my first letter from Granada's credit control department with the photocopied signature of Georgina Richards at the bottom. Over the months that followed I would get to know the squeezed-up, mean-looking lines of that signature very well. After July's missive, with my outstanding bill standing at a modest \u00a322.36, I confirmed the date of the theft and the crime number with the police, and passed them to the credit control department. Again, I was told that it would be sorted out and that I could apply for a repayment of any extra direct debits I had paid after the machine was stolen. Yet on 29 August, Georgina started playing hardball. Unless she heard from me within 48 hours she would 'apply for a Default Notice to be served under Section 87 (1) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974'. A week later, the notice arrived with a warning that if I didn't pay the outstanding balance, which had then risen to \u00a361.08, 'we shall take all the necessary steps to recover ALL [sic] monies due from you together with ALL legal costs.' This was beginning to get scary so I phoned again. I asked: 'Don't you think it seems a little unfair to expect me to continue to pay for a video that was stolen from me two years ago.' The call centre operator said: 'Our records say you owe us the money.' Me: 'Are you seriously saying you will take me to court for payments on a piece of equipment that the police know has been stolen?' 'It's not my decision,' he said. I was told to report the theft to a Granada show- room - something I had done two years earlier. I said I didn't see why I had to go through the process again. This, I later discovered, was registered on my Granada file as an outright refusal to report the theft. In October things started to get really heavy. Granada had passed the account to the TSR Debt Recovery Service, which demanded \u00a3272.47 to cover the outstanding payments and the cost of the stolen machine. At the end of the month, a firm of solicitors, JM O'Connor, warned me by letter that it was applying for a county court summons. My goods could be seized to recover the money owed, my pay taken from my employer or cash grabbed direct from my bank account. Last week, I decided to ring the Granada press office to see if this was usual procedure. The company has recently merged with Radio Rentals to become Box Clever, with a turnover of \u00a34 billion. I asked if the company had a policy of persecuting people who had made the mistake of having their video recorders stolen. I had spotted that the solicitors O'Connor and TSR Debt Recovery were both based at 239 Ampthill Road, Bedford, which just happens to be the headquarters of Granada Home Technology. The headed notepaper was just another of its scare tactics. Until this point I had proceeded as an ordinary citizen. But as soon as I revealed that I was a journalist, I was phoned within an hour from the managing director's office at Granada/Box Clever. I was told the 'debt' had been written off and was asked to accept an apology. I will do so if they can assure me that ordinary citizens are treated with such courtesy. Somehow, I doubt whether they honestly can. Playing it safe Simply telling the local branch of a chain from which you rent an electrical item about its theft is not enough. Malcolm Hurlston of the Consumer Credit Counselling Service says: 'There is a real problem with communication between the point of sale and the people who deal with the collection of payments. Attention to detail is not a strong point when we are being sold products.' So what should you do? First, report the theft to the police. At the very least they will provide you with a crime reference number. Then report the theft to the local branch, providing them with written details (of which you should retain a copy) which include the crime reference number. Insist on confirmation that the crime number has been passed on to the company's head office. In most cases, insurance is invalid if they don't receive the report within 30 days of the theft. Cancel the direct debit for rental payments if this is how you are paying. Keep copies of all written correspondence to support your case if the company later challenges you for further payment.

      "body": "<p>Among pictures by Alfred Munnings, Stanley Spencer and L S Lowry in Sotheby's sale of Modern British paintings and drawings next month are five cartoons by Gerald Scarfe. One caricatures the Prince of Wales with elephant ears, another shows Baroness Thatcher as Winston Churchill, giving a V salute. </p> <p>It is only the third time in 12 years that Scarfe's work has been included in Sotheby's sale of Modern British fine art. Cartoons are usually sold in sales of 'books and original book illustrations'. Are cartoon ists now to be valued as fine artists? What is going on? </p> <p>It was Susannah Pollen, Sotheby's Modern Brit specialist, who, at a bibulous boardroom lunch, first persuaded Scarfe to consign his work to auction. She says: 'I call them cartoons and make no apology for that. Scarfe's combination of draughtsmanship and satire make his cartoons by far and away the best of their genre.' </p> <p>But Scarfe is not the vendor of the five up for sale. Although Sotheby's has chosen not to reveal their provenance, they are, in fact, owned by John Cleese, of Fawlty Towers fame, and the way they came to auction gives some clues about what is happening at the top end of the cartoons market. </p> <p>Cleese bought them some 12 years ago from Chris Beetles, Britain's leading dealer in original illustrations. Beetles has a reputation for getting the best prices, so recently, when Cleese set up house in New York and wanted to shed some of his belongings, he instructed Beetles to sell his Scarfes. </p> <p>Ironically, the main market for Scarfe's work, and for the comparable excesses of the British cartoonist Ralph Steadman, popularly known for his Oddbins adverts, has shifted to the United States. So much so, that Beetles, fed up with chasing after the two cartoonists on the telephone on behalf of well-heeled clients, has stopped dealing in their work. He therefore consigned Cleese's Scarfes to Sotheby's. </p> <p>It will be interesting to see how they fare at the forthcoming auction without bids from Beetles the market-maker. Sotheby's pre-sale estimates are not much different from their prices at Beetles' London gallery 12 years ago. The black ink and watercolour of the Prince of Wales, for example, which had a \u00a34,500 tag at Beetles', is estimated \u00a34,000-\u00a36,000. The black ink of Lady Thatcher, also originally \u00a34,500, is estimated \u00a33,000-\u00a35,000. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Beetles is firming up his gallery's prices for cartoons by Ronald Searle, another British cartoonist lured to America who is now aged 80 and living in France. Searle's vivacious line and taste for the macabre influenced the work of the youngsters Scarfe and Steadman. And all three of them - the outrageous three Ss - owe a debt to James Gillray, the late eighteenth-century caricaturist who audaciously depicted members of the royal family, notably George III and the Prince Regent, defecating, vomiting and fornicating. </p> <p>In a few years' time, this spiritual link with eighteenth-century rumbunctuousness is bound to reveal the cartoons of the three Ss as belonging in a class of their own. No other cartoonist of the twentieth-century - neither Giles nor Low, even Cummings, but with the possible exception of Steve Bell - has matched the way they spatter venom. And their cartoons are as yet underpriced. They are worth considering as an investment. Searle's cartoons for the St Trinian's and Molesworth books of the Fifties are now so well-loved that it may be difficult to understand why the collected works of Gillray was Searle's book choice on Desert Island Discs. </p> <p>But his biographer, Russell Davies, juxtaposes the black humour of his cartoon of a gang of St Trinian's girls under the lash of a school mistress as they pull the sports ground roller with a strikingly similar drawing Searle made as a prisoner of war in Changi jail, Singapore, in 1944, of a gang of prisoners pulling tree trunks. In jail, he drew the dead and dying. In 1963, in New York's Bianchini Gallery, he launched a series of 73 ink, wash and watercolour 'Anatomies and Decapitations', anguished anatomical deconstructions never seen in Britain and still languishing in store. </p> <p>Until recently, his original cartoons fetched half the price of Scarfe or Steadman's, which are in notoriously short supply. But Beetles is pushing up his prices. In his current selling exhibition, Searle's 1992 ink and watercolour for Forbes FYI Magazine , 'The Glorious 12th', showing carnage on the grouse moors, has a tag of \u00a37,500. Molesworth in Elizabethan costume, an original illustration for Willans and Searle's 'Whizz for Atomms' (1956) is \u00a33,500 at Beetles, having cost \u00a31,180 (estimate \u00a3600-\u00a3800) at South Kensington in June. </p> <p>If those prices sound steep, consider that Beetles is offering EH Shepard's original pen and ink illustration of Christopher Robin and Piglet watching Pooh eat honey, from A.A. Milne's The House at Pooh Corner (1928), for \u00a385,000. It was bought at South Kensington in June for \u00a349,350. </p> <p>Beetles says: 'I admire Searle probably more than any other cartoonist. And his work is plentiful; he's not arrogant like some other cartoonists. The response to the Searles in my show has been fantastic. People seem to be rediscovering him.' </p> <p>Gerald Scarfe has branched out since making a name for himself in Private Eye and Punch. He created the characters for Disney's animated film Hercules, has designed sets and costumes for the Los Angeles Opera and designed and directed animation for the film Pink Floyd: The Wall . Last year the National Portrait Gallery, which paid \u00a34,510 for his iconic cartoon 'Nanny Thatcher' at his first outing in a Sotheby's Modern Brit auction in 1988, gave him a one-man show. </p> <p>He told me: 'I do regard my cartoons as art, but don't mind if people regard cartoons as a lowly form of it. A lot of artists have been cartoonists - Daumier and Lautrec, for example. </p> <p>'When I started working for Private Eye, people said I drew like Gillray, but I didn't know who Gillray was. I do now. But at the age of 14-16, Searle was my great hero. I absolutely adored his work. He lived in Newton Road, Bayswater, and I lived in Hampstead and used to cycle over to his home, intending to ring the bell on his gate. But I never had the courage. I think he is someone that England has overlooked; I think he should receive an honour.' </p> <p>Scarfe's work is not exactly being fought over at auction, certainly not by Beetles. Two Scarfe ink and watercolours showing wine tasters each fetched a modest \u00a3822 at South Kensington in June, having been estimated \u00a3800-\u00a31,200 each. A third wine-tasting cartoon of his failed to sell. </p> <p>Ralph Steadman seems to have the eighteenth century in his gut. His wild drawings are spattered with coloured ink that could be blood, wine, or plain filth. </p> <p>His illustrated books include lives of Freud and Leonardo; Hunter S Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, now a Terry Gilliam film; and he wrote the libretto for an oratorio, Plague and the Moonflower, which was made into a BBC2 film.

      "bodyText": "Among pictures by Alfred Munnings, Stanley Spencer and L S Lowry in Sotheby's sale of Modern British paintings and drawings next month are five cartoons by Gerald Scarfe. One caricatures the Prince of Wales with elephant ears, another shows Baroness Thatcher as Winston Churchill, giving a V salute. It is only the third time in 12 years that Scarfe's work has been included in Sotheby's sale of Modern British fine art. Cartoons are usually sold in sales of 'books and original book illustrations'. Are cartoon ists now to be valued as fine artists? What is going on? It was Susannah Pollen, Sotheby's Modern Brit specialist, who, at a bibulous boardroom lunch, first persuaded Scarfe to consign his work to auction. She says: 'I call them cartoons and make no apology for that. Scarfe's combination of draughtsmanship and satire make his cartoons by far and away the best of their genre.' But Scarfe is not the vendor of the five up for sale. Although Sotheby's has chosen not to reveal their provenance, they are, in fact, owned by John Cleese, of Fawlty Towers fame, and the way they came to auction gives some clues about what is happening at the top end of the cartoons market. Cleese bought them some 12 years ago from Chris Beetles, Britain's leading dealer in original illustrations. Beetles has a reputation for getting the best prices, so recently, when Cleese set up house in New York and wanted to shed some of his belongings, he instructed Beetles to sell his Scarfes. Ironically, the main market for Scarfe's work, and for the comparable excesses of the British cartoonist Ralph Steadman, popularly known for his Oddbins adverts, has shifted to the United States. So much so, that Beetles, fed up with chasing after the two cartoonists on the telephone on behalf of well-heeled clients, has stopped dealing in their work. He therefore consigned Cleese's Scarfes to Sotheby's. It will be interesting to see how they fare at the forthcoming auction without bids from Beetles the market-maker. Sotheby's pre-sale estimates are not much different from their prices at Beetles' London gallery 12 years ago. The black ink and watercolour of the Prince of Wales, for example, which had a \u00a34,500 tag at Beetles', is estimated \u00a34,000-\u00a36,000. The black ink of Lady Thatcher, also originally \u00a34,500, is estimated \u00a33,000-\u00a35,000. Meanwhile, Beetles is firming up his gallery's prices for cartoons by Ronald Searle, another British cartoonist lured to America who is now aged 80 and living in France. Searle's vivacious line and taste for the macabre influenced the work of the youngsters Scarfe and Steadman. And all three of them - the outrageous three Ss - owe a debt to James Gillray, the late eighteenth-century caricaturist who audaciously depicted members of the royal family, notably George III and the Prince Regent, defecating, vomiting and fornicating. In a few years' time, this spiritual link with eighteenth-century rumbunctuousness is bound to reveal the cartoons of the three Ss as belonging in a class of their own. No other cartoonist of the twentieth-century - neither Giles nor Low, even Cummings, but with the possible exception of Steve Bell - has matched the way they spatter venom. And their cartoons are as yet underpriced. They are worth considering as an investment. Searle's cartoons for the St Trinian's and Molesworth books of the Fifties are now so well-loved that it may be difficult to understand why the collected works of Gillray was Searle's book choice on Desert Island Discs. But his biographer, Russell Davies, juxtaposes the black humour of his cartoon of a gang of St Trinian's girls under the lash of a school mistress as they pull the sports ground roller with a strikingly similar drawing Searle made as a prisoner of war in Changi jail, Singapore, in 1944, of a gang of prisoners pulling tree trunks. In jail, he drew the dead and dying. In 1963, in New York's Bianchini Gallery, he launched a series of 73 ink, wash and watercolour 'Anatomies and Decapitations', anguished anatomical deconstructions never seen in Britain and still languishing in store. Until recently, his original cartoons fetched half the price of Scarfe or Steadman's, which are in notoriously short supply. But Beetles is pushing up his prices. In his current selling exhibition, Searle's 1992 ink and watercolour for Forbes FYI Magazine , 'The Glorious 12th', showing carnage on the grouse moors, has a tag of \u00a37,500. Molesworth in Elizabethan costume, an original illustration for Willans and Searle's 'Whizz for Atomms' (1956) is \u00a33,500 at Beetles, having cost \u00a31,180 (estimate \u00a3600-\u00a3800) at South Kensington in June. If those prices sound steep, consider that Beetles is offering EH Shepard's original pen and ink illustration of Christopher Robin and Piglet watching Pooh eat honey, from A.A. Milne's The House at Pooh Corner (1928), for \u00a385,000. It was bought at South Kensington in June for \u00a349,350. Beetles says: 'I admire Searle probably more than any other cartoonist. And his work is plentiful; he's not arrogant like some other cartoonists. The response to the Searles in my show has been fantastic. People seem to be rediscovering him.' Gerald Scarfe has branched out since making a name for himself in Private Eye and Punch. He created the characters for Disney's animated film Hercules, has designed sets and costumes for the Los Angeles Opera and designed and directed animation for the film Pink Floyd: The Wall . Last year the National Portrait Gallery, which paid \u00a34,510 for his iconic cartoon 'Nanny Thatcher' at his first outing in a Sotheby's Modern Brit auction in 1988, gave him a one-man show. He told me: 'I do regard my cartoons as art, but don't mind if people regard cartoons as a lowly form of it. A lot of artists have been cartoonists - Daumier and Lautrec, for example. 'When I started working for Private Eye, people said I drew like Gillray, but I didn't know who Gillray was. I do now. But at the age of 14-16, Searle was my great hero. I absolutely adored his work. He lived in Newton Road, Bayswater, and I lived in Hampstead and used to cycle over to his home, intending to ring the bell on his gate. But I never had the courage. I think he is someone that England has overlooked; I think he should receive an honour.' Scarfe's work is not exactly being fought over at auction, certainly not by Beetles. Two Scarfe ink and watercolours showing wine tasters each fetched a modest \u00a3822 at South Kensington in June, having been estimated \u00a3800-\u00a31,200 each. A third wine-tasting cartoon of his failed to sell. Ralph Steadman seems to have the eighteenth century in his gut. His wild drawings are spattered with coloured ink that could be blood, wine, or plain filth. His illustrated books include lives of Freud and Leonardo; Hunter S Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, now a Terry Gilliam film; and he wrote the libretto for an oratorio, Plague and the Moonflower, which was made into a BBC2 film. Interviewing Steadman is like taking the lid off a jar of vitriol. 'I don't sell a lot of stuff in England. I sell in America. Over here, forget it. I'm a stranger in my own land. Nobody here wants my work because I almost go out of my way to make it difficult to use. In the times of Hogarth and Goya the cartoonist's job was to be so offensive that nobody of note wanted to be around him. \"Watch out, or the little bastard will nail you.\" That's what cartooning should be like.

Much of Steadman's passion is now directed towards an art gallery/community project in a disused lunatic asylum in Haverfordwest, Dyfed, which will train youngsters who are 'underprivileged or institutionalised' in art and music.

      "bodyText": "The prospect of Japanese Bank Nomura bidding for Welsh Water is diminishing, according to sources close to the bank. Nomura's Principle Finance Group, headed by Guy Hands, is said to be unlikely to table an offer for the group unless a rival offer by Glas Cymru, a consortium of Welsh investors, is dropped or ruled out by the water regulator Philip Fletcher. Earlier this month Fletcher signalled that he saw no fundamental problems with the Glas bid, headed by former Treasury mandarin Lord Burns, although there were details that needed to be addressed. These include whether an organisation that is effectively a non-profit making mutual made up of members rather than conventional shareholders is capable of taking on the risks of managing water assets. Nomura originally bid for Welsh Water's parent, the beleaguered multi-utility Hyder, but was beaten in an extraordinary contest by US based WPD after a sealed bid process saw the company sold for \u00a32.4 billion. Hands' interest was renewed several weeks ago after Glas Cymru put in an offer to buy Welsh Water's assets from WPD for \u00a31.8bn, financed entirely by debt. An offer from Nomura would include raising equity of 25 per cent, which would mean the Japanese bank bearing extra financing costs to cover increased risk - a bill of \u00a35m-\u00a310m a year. A source close to Nomura said: 'They have looked closely at the numbers and they do not seem to make sense because Welsh Water is a tight proposition and they are facing additional costs just to table a similar offer to Glas. 'Unless Glas withdraws it is unlikely Nomura will bid.'",

The story of Amerada Hess reads like a Hollywood rendition of the great American dream. It is a rags-to-riches script of grit and determination dating from the Great Depression. </p> <p>The burial of Leon Hess, the company's 85-year-old founder, last year, marked more than just the passing of yet another fabulously rich tycoon (his wealth was put at $720 million). It was a farewell to the last in a long line of great US oilmen, whose ranks included John D Rockefeller, John Paul Getty and the now disgraced Armand Hammer. </p> <p>The son of Jewish Lithuanian immigrants, Hess started out in the oil business in 1933, taking over the struggling New Jersey door-to-door delivery round begun by his father, a kosher butcher by trade. At 18, selling fuel oil at four cents a gallon seemed to have brighter prospects than digging up clams or any of the sharp-witted youngster's other schemes to turn a buck. </p> <p>Today the trademark toy tankers issued by the firm every Christmas hark back to the 615-gallon second-hand Chevrolet truck with which Hess started out. Old mint-condition models fetch up to $5,000 apiece, a far cry from the $24.60 Hess first had to scrabble together. 'Everyone was broke then,' he once said. 'I had to pay for the truck before I delivered the oil.' </p> <p>By 1938, Hess Oil was running a fleet of 12 trucks and its self-effacing but highly motivated owner had also built his first oil storage depot in New Jersey. During the Second World War he supplied petrol to General George Patton before returning to build Hess Oil's chain of green-and-white liveried petrol stations into one of the most familiar features of America's East Coast. Last year, by the time he died, the firm was running 630 retail stations, in New York, New Jersey and Florida, and clocking up $7bn in sales and $440m in profits. </p> <p>Hess, a shrewd negotiator and political cultivator (he was a major donor to the Democrats), also relished a corporate scrap. The Amerada oil and gas exploration side came into the business after a hostile bid battle with rival Phillips Petroleum in 1969. The firm was set up in 1919 by an Englishman, Sir Wheetman Dickson Pearson, who later became Lord Cowdray. An amalgamation of 'America' and 'Canada', Amerada first drilled for oil in Oklahoma in the 1920s. The venture also bore the unusual distinction of being nationalised by Tory Winston Churchill in the 1940s and privatised by Labour's Harold Wilson in the 1960s. </p> <p>Hess had already arrived in Britain before snapping up Labour's first state sell-off, however. In 1964, a year after buying the New York Jets football team, the publicity-shy tycoon joined a consortium with Amoco, British Gas and Texas Eastern to take part in the first UK licensing round in the North Sea. </p> <p>Now, even before the Lasmo deal, Amerada Hess is the third-largest oil and gas producer in the UK behind BP Amoco and Shell, with interests in 35 fields and sales of $1.7bn last year. Since 1996, when the domestic gas market was opened up to competition, Amerada has become a growing rival to its erstwhile ally British Gas, and has now moved into electricity, too. </p> <p>'The UK is already crucially important to us and, with Lasmo, will continue to be,' an Amerada Hess spokesman said. 'We are pioneering floating production systems, like the new Triton field in the North Sea, and prospecting in the deep waters around the Faroes.' </p> <p>John Hess, now the firm's 45-year-old chief executive, could not have had a more different upbringing from his father. Educated at Harvard, he is a product of the Ivy League, with the obligatory MBA, who also speaks Arabic, Farsi, Spanish and French. He joined Amerada Hess in 1976 as a graduate trainee and, the only son among three children, took over the helm in 1995. </p> <p>That was the second time the firm's autocratic patriarch had retired. His first comeback, at the tender age of 72, took place in 1986, when Amerada Hess cut a fifth of its workforce, skipped its dividend and took a $430m write-down against its shipping fleet in a depressed oil sector. During the latest roller-coaster ride of the oil price (Amerada lost $460m in 1998), the founder remained chairman of the executive committee right up to his death. </p> <p>So why Lasmo and why now for Amerada Hess's biggest deal since the 1969 merger? 'We're always looking, but Lasmo only became available in the last few months,' a spokesman said. 'And it fits very well. They have assets where Amerada wants to be.' It also pushes the group into the oil world's top 10 for the first time. </p> <p>Lasmo, the old London &amp; Scottish Marine Oil, has had a lousy time since it narrowly escaped a hostile bid from UK rival Enterprise in 1994. Fresh talks foundered again last year as the two could not agree a vision for the future. Lasmo had tottered after overpaying in splashing out \u00a31bn on Ultramar in 1991. Of late, it has made the same mistakes again, paying a pricey \u00a3550m for Monument Oil &amp; Gas last year and a high \u00a3300m entry fee to get into Venezuela two years before. </p> <p>It is Lasmo's South American assets, plus its exposure to the North Sea, the Caspian, Asia, Algeria and Libya, which most interests Amerada. The deal pushes the boundaries without paying over the odds - just $5.49 for every barrel of Lasmo's reserves and this would certainly have pleased Hess Senior. He once emerged from talks in Libya, at which one of Muammar Gadaffy's aides pulled a gun, saying he wasn't the slightest bit fazed. </p> <p>The younger Hess, however, doesn't get to enjoy all his father's fringe benefits.

The House of Lords report said this should be changed to allow substitution. It also urged the Government to produce a Green Paper addressing these issues.

      "body": "<p>Pull up a stool at the bar of The Lamprey in Gloucester and you can tell you've stepped into the pub of the future. It's a place where the drinks are cool, the crowd is frisky and return on investment is, literally, on tap. </p> <p>It's a young, lunchtime crowd of mainly business customers. Three-and-a-half foot wide plasma screens hang on the walls, showing a continuous mix of adverts and videos of extreme sports such as hang-gliding. The regulars are surfing the web, clustered around the free internet stations. And there's a new buzz above the steady sound of chatter over lunch and a pint. </p> <p>The world of e-business is coming to a pub near you. The Lamprey and a dozen other pubs around the country are taking part in a pilot project that threatens to change a visit to the local forever. Especially those locals with an 18-30 crowd - because all of this, if you hadn't guessed, is in the name of winning a larger share of the twentysomethings' spending power. </p> <p>Advertisers know that 18- to 30-year-olds are notoriously difficult to reach. They're too busy working hard or playing hard to watch TV or read magazines. They go to the cinema, but only once a month, on average. You're more likely to catch them with a glass in their hand - they visit a bar or a pub twice a week on average. Once there, they are fickle in their drinking tastes, as likely to switch allegiance from Bacardi Breezer to Smirnoff Ice, from Bud to Becks, if that's what's hot with their friends. But they have high - and highly sought after - discretionary income. </p> <p>This venture aims to solve the advertisers' quandary by targeting eyeballs of the twentysomethings while they're having fun. The package includes point-of-sale monitoring at the tills, so there's an almost instant measure of the effect on sales of advertised brands. </p> <p>Translucis, the company behind the venture, is backed to the tune of more than \u00a35 million by Diageo, the company formed from Guinness and Grand Metropolitan. Their top people come mainly from Diageo and are drinks industry veterans. This is one of the new breed of 'clicks and mortar' e-business projects backed by a combination of industry know-how and the deep pockets of a market leader. </p> <p>The plan, says Liz Paxton, Translucis's commercial director, is to install systems in pubs that attract crowds of 800 or more on a busy night. The package consists of plasma screens, internet connections and point-of-sale software. Translucis sells airtime to advertisers and broadcasts the ads and entertainment content over satellite links to the pubs. Participating publicans can choose what they want to show and take a share of the advertising revenue. They will see a swift return according to Paxton, quoting the example of a three-screen package costing around \u00a318,000 with a payback period of between a year and 18 months. Internet access also provides the publican with services like previewing videos of bands and booking them for live gigs, a kind of intranet for the licensed trade. </p> <p>But the key feature is the link between the screens and the tills. What really interests the advertisers, of course, is the impact their ads are having on drink sales. The main benefit of the system is that it tells them precisely how much their brand's exposure on screen is doing for sales - at which till in which pub. It's the kind of test marketing that they could only achieve in the past by comparing the results of different ads in different TV regions. </p> <p>A ready reckoner supplied as part of the package helps publicans work out how quick a payback they'll receive from their share of the advertising revenue. So far, the licensees say the system is looking like a promising investment. </p> <p>'It's a powerful tool,' claims Jamie Anderson, proprietor of Caf\u00e9 Latino in London's Soho. As soon as the screens started showing ads for Red Bull, says Anderson, 'you could tell the next day - sales were up'. He says his customers like the buzz of rapidly changing content on the screens. </p> <p>'Its right there, in their faces. There are people jumping off mountains on bikes and people canoeing down waterfalls,' he explains. Anderson says it's unlikely his customers would want to watch sports such as soccer but they enjoy the mixture of adverts and entertainment the system offers. The bottom line is that he's had a better month since it was installed and he's planning to keep it. </p> <p>As with many e-business projects, it is difficult to pin down the overall impact on takings, but the signs are that adding entertainment and interactivity to the retail experience does persuade us to part with more cash. </p> <p>Back at The Lamprey, the regulars are voting with their pay packets. Ross Andrews, assistant manager, says the screens are leading to changing drinking habits. Hardly any of his regulars used to drink Sol. Now that they've started seeing the ads on the plasma screens, he says, they're drinking their way through seven crates a week. </p> <p> <strong>High street traders take on the e-tailers at their own game</strong><br></p> <p> With many of the online e-tailers falling down badly on fulfilment of orders, the traditional 'bricks and mortar' businesses are taking the fight to the e-tailers' own battleground, adding interactivity to the retail experience. It is difficult to put figures on the impact of this, but top retailers claim there is a significant pay-off. </p> <p>Debenhams claims its internet-based wedding gift service, available on in-store screens as well as at home, now has 25 per cent of the wedding gift market and is used by more than 25,000 couples a year. The list is updated as soon as a guest buys a gift, to avoid duplication. </p> <p>Waitrose says Quick Check, its service giving shoppers a running total of what they are spending and allowing them to skip checkout queues, is an important factor in the company's climb up the food chain. </p> <p>And Waterstone's says screens at the entrance to its stores achieve outstanding success in promoting the latest titles.

      "body": "<p>Life is no beach for holiday boss David Crossland. While the 13 million customers of his Airtours group are reclining on the sand, his share price has halved in the last year and the City wants answers. </p> <p>The Lancashire lad who built what until recently was the world's biggest holiday business from scratch has tumbled from stock market darling to scapegoat. </p> <p>With an estimated \u00a3400 million family fortune, houses in Jersey and Aspen, a private jet and world-record levels of workaholism, Crossland should be basking at the pinnacle of his career, or planning early retirement. Instead he is working sweatshop hours in Germany, trying to shore up a loss-making acquisition. And this week, after two warnings, he will have to explain to shareholders why underlying group profitability for 1999-2000 has slumped to around \u00a390m, compared with \u00a3156m in the previous year. Staff share options are under water. </p> <p>If that was not grim enough, the legendary predator has been turned into prey, and observers are urging him to do his last deal - not buying this time, but selling out. </p> <p>People close to Crossland describe him as unique, and explain how some of the principal entrepreneurial qualities that transformed him from zero to hero are now working against him and his firm. Several senior executives out of a swathe that have abandoned Airtours in the last two years have told The Observer they became disillusioned with the company but certainly not with Crossland (who has made them all millionaires). One said: 'He is absolutely unbelievable. I have never known someone in such a senior position stay so close to the minutiae of the business. </p> <p>'When I first introduced myself to him he instantly regaled me with more facts about my previous companies than I knew myself. And he will spot almost instinctively the one figure that is wrong on a balance sheet.' </p> <p>Crossland is famous for getting up at 4am and working like a Trojan, even on 'holiday' - something he rarely took until recently, despite being in the travel business. Colleagues say he is ruthless in meetings, swiftly rooting out waffle or ignorance with a sharp cry of 'bullshit!' in the direction of any hapless executive who has dared sound a millimetre off the ball. </p> <p>But he does not lose his temper and is described as showing a humbleness rare in big business, an asset it is said his more bumptious lieutenants have lacked over the years. The ex-Airtours executive said: 'When I was going to leave it was David who fought hardest to persuade me to stay, when others below him let their egos get in the way. David knows the business is bigger than him and complacency is a killer. </p> <p>'Whereas others have come along who share his hard edge, many lack his incredible passion for every last detail of the business - he can be really intimidating but is also the best motivator I have ever worked for.' </p> <p>Crossland has described his best day in management as the day he floated Airtours in 1987. Close associates say his unfulfilled ambition is to see Airtours in the FTSE 100 index of leading shares. It was pretty close at about 110 18 months ago, and would have pushed in if he had succeeded in forming a \u00a33 billion group with the hostile takeover - blocked by the European Commission - of rival First Choice last year. </p> <p>But with Airtours' current market capitalisation at \u00a31.1bn that is now a fantasy and the group could well end up in foreign hands some time in the next year. </p> <p>Management issues aside, Crossland has described the best day of his life as 13 August 1963, the day when, having left Burnley Grammar School at 16 with three O-levels, he was given his first job making tea in a travel agency. </p> <p>He found school hard work but real work a dream. Within three months he was selling holidays and said his technique was 'just to listen' to customers. He picked up clues about what holiday they would prefer from what they said they liked and hated about previous trips. </p> <p>Decades on, colleagues recognise the same characteristics. One said: 'David is like an octopus. He sits with people and listens to all their ideas and suggestions coming in from different directions, sucks them all in and then spits out a decision.' </p> <p>The young Crossland also got a kick out of 'taking the money' and made sure that, more often than not, a chat over a brochure turned into a sale. He got his big break in 1972 when an elderly couple sold him their two travel agency shops. His brother-in-law lent him half the money and he borrowed the rest from the bank - selling a holiday to the bank manager as he clinched the loan. </p> <p>He did the same with his wife Anne, and loves telling how they met. She came into one of his agencies more than 20 years ago and he asked her out to dinner. 'But not before I'd sold her a holiday and taken the money,' he boasts. </p> <p>In the decade after 1972 Crossland scooped up almost 20 agencies and began putting together travel packages. He was carrying almost 250,000 people a year in the early Eighties and formed Airtours International as a charter airline as business grew. </p> <p>Early success was built on expanding out of Manchester Airport to new destinations at cheaper prices, but two things kept Airtours' reputation in the balance after its flotation. The first was lingering question marks over the quality of the product - the price was always tempting, but compared to solid market leader Thomson Holidays or smaller players such as Cosmos, the complaint rate from unhappy Airtours customers was a dodgy 8 per cent. </p> <p>The second was the question of whether Airtours would survive or implode under the pressure of 'pile it high, sell it cheap' tactics as it expanded in great leaps in the early Nineties on the back of other failures in this notoriously volatile industry. </p> <p>When Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group (ILG) collapsed spectacularly in 1991, Crossland swooped. An insider recalls: 'Before anyone could blink David hired a Lear jet and, overnight, dropped contractors in all the major holiday resorts in Europe to buy up ILG's hotel beds.' In only a year, Airtours' capacity tripled to around 600,000 packages a year. </p> <p>In the early years, Crossland used to travel overseas with at least one suitcase full of hard cash 'just in case he needed to do a deal'. Then he bought the agency chains Pickfords and Hogg Robinson and transformed them into the 800-strong Going Places chain. By the mid-Nineties, when the business was still growing so fast the City wondered if it would follow ILG, Crossland made an emphatic move. The insider said: 'He had the sense to realise price was not everything. We ditched a lot of the worst-sell ing hotels and made a culture change to improve quality.' </p> <p>Airtours began its next wave of expansion, both of product and geography. Crossland bought the leading travel business in Scandinavia, then left Thomson standing with acquisitions in Belgium, Holland, the US, Canada and a partnership with US cruise giant Carnival. </p> <p>He expanded into long-haul holidays and bought cruise ships. But he has been outflanked since Thomson was bought by German leader Preussag earlier this year for \u00a31.8bn.. A potential partner, German number two C&amp;N, shunned Crossland's asking price of \u00a35 a share and now seems keener on buying Thomas Cook than Airtours. Now commentators fear Crossland will be left behind in the European size game. They worry about losses in his businesses in North America, an expected \u00a3100m deficit at the Frosch Touristic subsidiary in Germany, and a sense of drift at Airtours since it failed to buy First Choice last year, despite a solid summer performance in the UK. </p> <p>Critics say Airtours has missed Crossland's sure touch as he took half a step back in the last year and handed over to his new protege Tim Byrne. But fans say Crossland is an 'industry icon' and his mix of graft and magic will find a solution yet. </p> <p><strong> Vital signs</strong> </p> <p><strong> Born: </strong> 18 December 1946 <br></p> <p><strong> Job: </strong> Chairman, Airtours <br></p> <p><strong> Other directorships: </strong> Carnival Corporation <br></p> <p><strong> Hobbies: </strong> Skiing in Aspen, Colorado, with wife Anne, their children and grandchildren</p>",

Early success was built on expanding out of Manchester Airport to new destinations at cheaper prices, but two things kept Airtours' reputation in the balance after its flotation. The first was lingering question marks over the quality of the product - the price was always tempting, but compared to solid market leader Thomson Holidays or smaller players such as Cosmos, the complaint rate from unhappy Airtours customers was a dodgy 8 per cent. The second was the question of whether Airtours would survive or implode under the pressure of 'pile it high, sell it cheap' tactics as it expanded in great leaps in the early Nineties on the back of other failures in this notoriously volatile industry. When Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group (ILG) collapsed spectacularly in 1991, Crossland swooped. An insider recalls: 'Before anyone could blink David hired a Lear jet and, overnight, dropped contractors in all the major holiday resorts in Europe to buy up ILG's hotel beds.' In only a year, Airtours' capacity tripled to around 600,000 packages a year. In the early years, Crossland used to travel overseas with at least one suitcase full of hard cash 'just in case he needed to do a deal'. Then he bought the agency chains Pickfords and Hogg Robinson and transformed them into the 800-strong Going Places chain. By the mid-Nineties, when the business was still growing so fast the City wondered if it would follow ILG, Crossland made an emphatic move. The insider said: 'He had the sense to realise price was not everything. We ditched a lot of the worst-sell ing hotels and made a culture change to improve quality.' Airtours began its next wave of expansion, both of product and geography. Crossland bought the leading travel business in Scandinavia, then left Thomson standing with acquisitions in Belgium, Holland, the US, Canada and a partnership with US cruise giant Carnival. He expanded into long-haul holidays and bought cruise ships. But he has been outflanked since Thomson was bought by German leader Preussag earlier this year for \u00a31.8bn.. A potential partner, German number two C&amp;N, shunned Crossland's asking price of \u00a35 a share and now seems keener on buying Thomas Cook than Airtours. Now commentators fear Crossland will be left behind in the European size game. They worry about losses in his businesses in North America, an expected \u00a3100m deficit at the Frosch Touristic subsidiary in Germany, and a sense of drift at Airtours since it failed to buy First Choice last year, despite a solid summer performance in the UK. Critics say Airtours has missed Crossland's sure touch as he took half a step back in the last year and handed over to his new protege Tim Byrne. But fans say Crossland is an 'industry icon' and his mix of graft and magic will find a solution yet.

Plans to restrict parking in some city centres could push those workers back on to rail - if they can get to stations.

A new community bus service in the Yorkshire Coalfields near Barnsley is allowing workers in an area of 35 per cent unemployment to take up jobs in call centres that were 70 per cent understaffed.

Increased bicycle parking spaces and shower facilities would encourage many more workers to cycle, says spokeswoman Carey Newson. Asda, the supermarket chain, which employs 100,000, looks set to become a model company. Worried by October's fuel crisis, it decided to offer all employees cost-price bicycles from the new year and other green travel plans including ways of encouraging car-sharing.</p> <p> Another option is for more people to work from home on top of the 2.5 million who already do so. Enlightened employers are increasingly trusting some staff to work some of their week there. Such arrangements could also help if the infrastructure has to deal with major health and safety checks, floods and other problems of the sort we now face.</p> <p> Of course, traffic chaos and overloading can be a direct function of successful capitalism - an unwelcome side effect of an otherwise welcome phenomenon. 'When the economy is doing well, it does traditionally drive more people on to the railway,' says Smith.

After all, it's clearly in its interest too.</p> <p><strong>Hospital finds remedy for its transport problems</strong><br></p> <p>One of the largest non-teaching hospitals in Europe, Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, faced a crisis in getting staff to work when it built additional wards in 1996. </p> <p>When the council refused its request for 630 new parking spaces, managers at the acute and specialist hospital set up their own transport plans. </p> <p>They began encouraging car-sharing among the 5,000 staff.

      "body": "<p><strong> Jaguar XKR</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Price </strong>\u00a367,000 </p> <p><strong>MPG</strong> 22.2 </p> <p><strong>Engine size</strong> 4 litres </p> <p><strong>Max speed</strong> 155mph </p> <p><strong>0-60mph </strong> 5.3 seconds </p> <p><strong>Driven wheels</strong> 2 </p> <p> I suppose it had to happen. I had driven up from the Costa del Sol to the City via the Channel Tunnel and M20, stopping overnight at Aracena, San Sebastian and the depths of Perigord. On the move, the Jag was only rarely travelling at less than 100mph. The fast, new roads that scythe through Spain and France are so beautifully aligned and the supercharged XKR so supremely sure and relaxed that travelling at anything less than Valkyrian speed seemed an insult to both the mechanical big cat from Coventry and the engineers who built these pan-European expressways. </p> <p>What had to happen? Did I prang the Jag/finally deplete the world of its fossil-fuel reserve/decide to give up motoring for fear of floods/global warming/general guilt/speeding offences? No, I got nicked, bang-to-rights, for making a right turn on a no-right-turn sign outside King's Cross station, driving at walking pace in the teeming rain and about a mile from home. The police officer was nice enough, once we got down to a bit of a Jag talk. I think he thought I was fair game, not just because I was breaking the law but because I was slinking around in a \u00a367,000 Jag and, in his eyes, taking a Toad-like view of the rules of the road. Anyway, it was only a 20-quid fine, so no bad feelings either way, Officer. </p> <p>It did strike me, though, that the XKR is not all that suited to British roads. In its element purring along the Costa del Sol, flying straight as an arrow along European roads that make England's seem positively pre-Telford, this is a true grand tourer. And little, anti-Europe Britain is no place for grand touring; the XKR had to be held on a tight mechanical rein from journey's beginning to its end within the confines of these traffic-coned isles. </p> <p>So what's a chap to do with a 370bhp, 155mph sports car but chase the sun across rainless plains, drift through high sierras and schmooze along coasts in the kind of style the Spanish love, the French most probably respect behind the supercilious sneers and even English traffic cops sneakily admire? This is one of those cars I didn't want to give back. It is a terrific performer and made friends for Jaguar wherever it went. The Mayor of Aracena enjoyed a lift back to his office. Children in the villages above Algeciras took turns to raise and lower the hood. El Jaguar (pronounce the J as H) was a much-loved beast. </p> <p>When the XK8 (the XKR is the extremely powerful supercharged version) first appeared a few years back, I was critical of its shape. Too American, too bulbous, a Corvette crossed with some bloated Nissan coup\u00e9. In XKR form, with a number of small styling changes, the car looks pretty good. Low-slung, high-wheeled, a complex of Spitfire-like compound curves, fiercely feline but subtle. Just the one small, badge featuring a roaring Jaguar and the legend '4-litre Supercharged' on the prognathous bonnet and a sleek XKR below the rounded boot. The XKR is definitely a Jaguar. </p> <p>I do have reservations.

      "bodyText": "Jaguar XKR Price \u00a367,000 MPG 22.2 Engine size 4 litres Max speed 155mph 0-60mph 5.3 seconds Driven wheels 2 I suppose it had to happen. I had driven up from the Costa del Sol to the City via the Channel Tunnel and M20, stopping overnight at Aracena, San Sebastian and the depths of Perigord. On the move, the Jag was only rarely travelling at less than 100mph. The fast, new roads that scythe through Spain and France are so beautifully aligned and the supercharged XKR so supremely sure and relaxed that travelling at anything less than Valkyrian speed seemed an insult to both the mechanical big cat from Coventry and the engineers who built these pan-European expressways. What had to happen? Did I prang the Jag/finally deplete the world of its fossil-fuel reserve/decide to give up motoring for fear of floods/global warming/general guilt/speeding offences? No, I got nicked, bang-to-rights, for making a right turn on a no-right-turn sign outside King's Cross station, driving at walking pace in the teeming rain and about a mile from home. The police officer was nice enough, once we got down to a bit of a Jag talk. I think he thought I was fair game, not just because I was breaking the law but because I was slinking around in a \u00a367,000 Jag and, in his eyes, taking a Toad-like view of the rules of the road. Anyway, it was only a 20-quid fine, so no bad feelings either way, Officer. It did strike me, though, that the XKR is not all that suited to British roads. In its element purring along the Costa del Sol, flying straight as an arrow along European roads that make England's seem positively pre-Telford, this is a true grand tourer. And little, anti-Europe Britain is no place for grand touring; the XKR had to be held on a tight mechanical rein from journey's beginning to its end within the confines of these traffic-coned isles. So what's a chap to do with a 370bhp, 155mph sports car but chase the sun across rainless plains, drift through high sierras and schmooze along coasts in the kind of style the Spanish love, the French most probably respect behind the supercilious sneers and even English traffic cops sneakily admire? This is one of those cars I didn't want to give back. It is a terrific performer and made friends for Jaguar wherever it went. The Mayor of Aracena enjoyed a lift back to his office. Children in the villages above Algeciras took turns to raise and lower the hood. El Jaguar (pronounce the J as H) was a much-loved beast. When the XK8 (the XKR is the extremely powerful supercharged version) first appeared a few years back, I was critical of its shape. Too American, too bulbous, a Corvette crossed with some bloated Nissan coup\u00e9. In XKR form, with a number of small styling changes, the car looks pretty good. Low-slung, high-wheeled, a complex of Spitfire-like compound curves, fiercely feline but subtle. Just the one small, badge featuring a roaring Jaguar and the legend '4-litre Supercharged' on the prognathous bonnet and a sleek XKR below the rounded boot. The XKR is definitely a Jaguar. I do have reservations. Please, Jaguar, get rid of the plank of mirror-finish wood veneer that looks more like a mantel shelf from a Las Vegas whorehouse than the dashboard of one of the most civilised cars on the road. Give me a set of decent gauges rather than a gimmicky navigation system. Reduce the number of gadgets in the centre console.

It was only meant to be temporary, but father ended up keeping him. </p> <p>I remember standing in a desolate cold hallway in our flat in Spain looking for my twin to play with. I can't really blame my parents - maybe my Mum thought she couldn't handle any more kids and Dad felt he could only look after one. </p> <p>Alex grew up with all the privileges of an only child, he got a good education and he made the best of it. But I got to grow up with an elder brother, John, who always looked out for me. </p> <p>After three years in Spain, we moved to a north London council estate. We found it incredibly hard to adjust. My mother suffered terrible abuse and we were known as the little Paki boys. Urban life without money in England can be cruel. Everyday, we literally had to fight to survive. </p> <p>We got into kick boxing after a streetfight. John was stabbed - it was awful - blood spurted out of his chest like a fountain. We decided we had to learn to protect ourselves. </p> <p>Growing up, I always missed my twin. In our teens we started to see each other more, as we could travel independently. Alex's sport was rugby until I convinced him to join us. It was a great feeling seeing my twin enter the dojo [training area], I knew then that the sport would bring us closer together. Watching boxing matches together or comparing moves would strengthen our bond. </p> <p>When John decided to set up his own kick-boxing gym, blood, sweat and tears from all of us went into making it a success. Alex and John are far more motivated than I am, they want to build an industry and be financially secure, for me security is to have a family and settle down. We don't argue much but, sometimes if we have a score to settle, the only way to do it is in the ring. We'd never fight each other in a proper competition, though, the bond is too close. It has to be genetic that all three of us fight the way we do. Alex and I never really lived together, so it must be in our blood. </p> <p> <strong> Alex Lawson: </strong> I did feel isolated growing up away from my brothers, especially my twin. I'd yearn for the holidays so I could see them again. After we'd spent time together, I would always be the one who had to leave, I never understood why and I would always pine for a few days after. </p> <p>From the age of 13, I attended a boarding school in Surrey. It was difficult knowing my brothers were having a tough time on that estate. There was a stage when I started to blame myself. I used to feel guilty for having had a private education, nice holidays and a big bedroom to myself, but I had no control over my youth. </p> <p>Once I'd left boarding school, I saw my brothers much more. When I started training, our relationship grew much stronger. It was a difficult time because it was then that I realised what I'd missed out on for so many years. Now I can tell Stuart anything. There's a good balance in our relationship, we're comfortable with each other - I relax as soon as I see him. </p> <p>Our personalities are reflected in the ring: Stuart has a real ruthlessness, he can be a beast. He'll knock opponents down and laugh at them, while I'll run to the corner and feel concerned. All of us are well respected on the kick-boxing circuit and, I suppose, sometimes feared. Opponents will opt to fight a Lawson brother if they've got something to prove. </p> <p>I do want to emulate my brothers' success in the ring, both have been world champions. Sometimes I worry that coming from a different background to my brothers, I don't have the same hunger, drive and commitment that they had to push them to the top. I'd never fight my brothers professionally, though, because one of us is going to lose. </p> <p>Setting up my own gym was something that I felt I needed to do. I was itching for the challenge of a varied workload; managing a team and taking on my own responsibility. Our childhood was difficult, but we've got through it, now I'm just grateful that we all work in the same industry and get on as well as we do.</p>",

Not perhaps the gravest of punishments given that the view offered from that bit of the Bridge is marginally worse than that afforded from the back of The Shed.</p> <p> Davies was blameless although he might have been forewarned had he read Chelsea... My Year by Ken Bates (first published in Britain in 1984 by Chelsea Football Club, priced \u00a38.00 in paperback). In particular, he should have heeded the following entry: </p> <p>Friday, 21 October: 'We had a boisterous time at the Isolabella although I had us moved to a better table after the first course, which Fred said was typical of me. (Pam and I once had a five-course meal on five different tables in Durban!) Towards the end of lunch we were both a little merry. </p> <p>'Fred paid the bill with his Visa card, which I carefully inspected when it had been returned with receipt [sic] by the waiter and exclaimed to him in front of Fred, \"You know this is a forgery don't you\" and promptly tore it in half and slung the bits back on the plate. </p> <p>The manager got worried just in case he had been paid with a forged card and came over to examine the remains. Fred was most put out and I had to quieten him with a lecture on the evils of paying on credit.' </p> <p>Wonderful stuff (wouldn't you have loved to have been in Durban?), which proves, if proof were needed, that Bates resembles nothing so much as Michael Winner without a restaurant column. 'Another Table for Mr Bates' might paper up this oversight. </p> <p>Similarly bizarre is the tale of Charlie Allan from the Aberdeen Evening Express, who was just one of many to fall foul of the McLean brothers at Dundee United. 'I'd written a story about Mark Perry moving from Dundee United to Aberdeen,' says Allan. 'And Tommy McLean and his brother agreed that if I didn't reveal my sources I'd be banned from Tannadice' - actually, Perry did move shortly after. 'And the newspaper in its wisdom made up a series of masks of me for the fans to wear, which they did. </p> <p>'There were guys at the door checking that I was not trying to sneak in so I wore one of the bloody masks and got in no problem. And I'm a bit rotund, shall we say, and the fans who wore the masks were getting free pies. It was quite amusing but a bit embarrassing.' </p> <p>Soon after the McLean brothers, conscious they were losing the publicity war, recanted and lifted the ban.</p> <p> Less fortunate was Tim Taylor of the Newcastle Journal , who was banned from St James' Park when Kevin Keegan was manager and 'as far as I know I'm still banned'. His offence, after some confusion involving a couple of Terrys, Venables and McDermott, over the state of Andy Cole's shin splints, was to write that either someone was being economical with the truth or McDermott needed to be properly briefed.</p> <p> 'It was shown to the lawyer and okayed,' says Taylor. 'And the next week the paper and I were banned. I wasn't even being particularly aggressive, just straight forward.' </p> <p>Taylor moved over to cover Sunderland, and later, when his son was diagnosed as having schizophrenia, moved up to a management job so he might help care for him. At no time did Newcastle rescind the ban so blithely imposed. A journalist who was never afraid to rattle a few cages, Taylor is less than sanguine as to the prospects of newspapers standing up to intemperate chairmen and managers, particularly at local level. </p> <p> 'In the old days, before the advent of Sky, the local paper and the club needed to rub along. The newspapers would hope to build a circulation and the clubs would hope to build a gate. Now do the clubs need local paper coverage? Do they fuck. By the time I get to my old age we will be talking about the days when Mark Lawrenson, Patrick Collins, Hughie Mcllvanney and Kevin Mitchell were telling it like it was rather than some big blob telling us how it should be.' </p> <p>By such a time, Tony Hudd might yet be allowed to watch Gillingham again. Since March 1998, Hudd and his paper Medway Today , formerly Kent Today , and all who work for it have been banned from Priestfield by chairman Paul Scally. </p> <p>Hudd believes that it is the longest blanket ban to be imposed on a newspaper and there is little prospect of it end ing. 'I wrote to him in the summer,' says Hudd, 'and surprise, surprise I'm still waiting for a reply. I've covered the club for more than 25 years and I'm resigned to the fact that I'll never be able to walk through the gates again as a bona fide working journalist.' </p> <p>It only takes a phone call for a dictatorial chairman to quell a dissenting voice. Not that there are many. The TV companies are dependent on chairman for their precious TV rights; the journalists dependent on the clubs for their precious exclusives. Thus it is that the majority of what you see and read is just so much public relations. </p> <p>Not long ago, Tony Hudd orchestrated the campaign for Peter Taylor to become Gillingham manager following Tony Pulis's departure after a bust-up with Scally. When Taylor moved on he spoke to Hudd and said he'd told Scally that one of the conditions of his staying would be the lifting of the ban. Taylor went and the ban remained.</p> <p>So it is that the man arguably responsible for the appointment of the acting England manager is still prevented from watching Gillingham at home. It's that petty, and things can only get pettier. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

'It was shown to the lawyer and okayed,' says Taylor. 'And the next week the paper and I were banned. I wasn't even being particularly aggressive, just straight forward.' Taylor moved over to cover Sunderland, and later, when his son was diagnosed as having schizophrenia, moved up to a management job so he might help care for him. At no time did Newcastle rescind the ban so blithely imposed. A journalist who was never afraid to rattle a few cages, Taylor is less than sanguine as to the prospects of newspapers standing up to intemperate chairmen and managers, particularly at local level. 'In the old days, before the advent of Sky, the local paper and the club needed to rub along. The newspapers would hope to build a circulation and the clubs would hope to build a gate. Now do the clubs need local paper coverage? Do they fuck. By the time I get to my old age we will be talking about the days when Mark Lawrenson, Patrick Collins, Hughie Mcllvanney and Kevin Mitchell were telling it like it was rather than some big blob telling us how it should be.' By such a time, Tony Hudd might yet be allowed to watch Gillingham again. Since March 1998, Hudd and his paper Medway Today , formerly Kent Today , and all who work for it have been banned from Priestfield by chairman Paul Scally. Hudd believes that it is the longest blanket ban to be imposed on a newspaper and there is little prospect of it end ing. 'I wrote to him in the summer,' says Hudd, 'and surprise, surprise I'm still waiting for a reply. I've covered the club for more than 25 years and I'm resigned to the fact that I'll never be able to walk through the gates again as a bona fide working journalist.' It only takes a phone call for a dictatorial chairman to quell a dissenting voice. Not that there are many. The TV companies are dependent on chairman for their precious TV rights; the journalists dependent on the clubs for their precious exclusives. Thus it is that the majority of what you see and read is just so much public relations. Not long ago, Tony Hudd orchestrated the campaign for Peter Taylor to become Gillingham manager following Tony Pulis's departure after a bust-up with Scally. When Taylor moved on he spoke to Hudd and said he'd told Scally that one of the conditions of his staying would be the lifting of the ban. Taylor went and the ban remained. So it is that the man arguably responsible for the appointment of the acting England manager is still prevented from watching Gillingham at home. It's that petty, and things can only get pettier. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say. Send your comments, as sharp or as stupid as you like, to editor@footballunlimited.co.uk",

Privately, Tardelli has been impressed by Keane's attitude and skill level, still considering him a sound long-term investment, but is less than enamoured with his positional sense and tactical awareness, the result, he believes, of sub-standard coaching in Britain. </p> <p>So the likelihood is that Keane will spend the second half of this season out on loan, a policy Inter adopted with some success in the cases of Uruguayan striker Alvero Racoba and French goalkeeper Sebastian Frey. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

His future at Inter, who paid Coventry \u00a313 million for his services last summer, has been placed under a cloud by the team's inept start to the season and the appointment of Marco Tardelli as manager in place of Marcello Lippi. Reggina, looking ahead to Italy's next transfer window in January, attempted to secure the loan signing of 20-year-old striker Keane last week, a move that was rejected by Inter - for the time being. Privately, Tardelli has been impressed by Keane's attitude and skill level, still considering him a sound long-term investment, but is less than enamoured with his positional sense and tactical awareness, the result, he believes, of sub-standard coaching in Britain. So the likelihood is that Keane will spend the second half of this season out on loan, a policy Inter adopted with some success in the cases of Uruguayan striker Alvero Racoba and French goalkeeper Sebastian Frey. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>The semi-finals of the FA Cup will be played at Wembley once it reopens in a desperate bid to help the \u00a3660 million stadium pay its huge debts. </p> <p>The Football Association have decided that both semi-finals will be staged at the rebuilt venue for 30 years after its scheduled unveiling in early 2004. Critics claim letting four FA Cup contenders rather than just the two finalists play at Wembley will threaten the supposedly 'special' nature of playing there. </p> <p>They have accused the FA of ignoring the Cup's traditions in its determination to give the stadium - which it now owns - two guaranteed sell-out events. </p> <p>Malcolm Clarke, national chair of the Football Supporters Association, said the move undermined the FA's well-publicised promises earlier this year to 'revive the magic of the Cup' after a series of blows including holders Manchester United's non-participation last year and a growing loss of interest among fans. </p> <p>'Most fans will be disappointed by this news,' said Clarke. 'This won't help restore the Cup to its former glory. Part of its traditional appeal was the magic of Wembley and the idea that going there wasn't routine. It shouldn't be routine to get there. It will make going to Wembley less special.' </p> <p>The FA's decision comes amid growing concern that the new stadium may not generate enough money to pay the \u00a330m-a-year interest on the \u00a3410m loan it is currently trying to raise to fund the redevelopment. </p> <p>The FA's financial director, Michael Cunnah, confirmed that both semi-finals will be held at Wembley after it reopens in 2004.

      "bodyText": "The semi-finals of the FA Cup will be played at Wembley once it reopens in a desperate bid to help the \u00a3660 million stadium pay its huge debts. The Football Association have decided that both semi-finals will be staged at the rebuilt venue for 30 years after its scheduled unveiling in early 2004. Critics claim letting four FA Cup contenders rather than just the two finalists play at Wembley will threaten the supposedly 'special' nature of playing there. They have accused the FA of ignoring the Cup's traditions in its determination to give the stadium - which it now owns - two guaranteed sell-out events. Malcolm Clarke, national chair of the Football Supporters Association, said the move undermined the FA's well-publicised promises earlier this year to 'revive the magic of the Cup' after a series of blows including holders Manchester United's non-participation last year and a growing loss of interest among fans. 'Most fans will be disappointed by this news,' said Clarke. 'This won't help restore the Cup to its former glory. Part of its traditional appeal was the magic of Wembley and the idea that going there wasn't routine. It shouldn't be routine to get there. It will make going to Wembley less special.' The FA's decision comes amid growing concern that the new stadium may not generate enough money to pay the \u00a330m-a-year interest on the \u00a3410m loan it is currently trying to raise to fund the redevelopment. The FA's financial director, Michael Cunnah, confirmed that both semi-finals will be held at Wembley after it reopens in 2004. However, if two teams from the North-East or North-West are drawn to meet in a semi-final, that match may be played instead at a league ground to save fans having to travel to London. A Sunderland-Newcastle United game could thus be played at Old Trafford, for example, or a Manchester United-Liverpool match at St James' Park. Usually, though, both semi-finals will be played in north London. This action will bring in several millions of pounds in much-needed revenue for Wembley National Stadium Limited (WNSL), the stadium's owners. WNSL is a subsidiary of the FA and believe that the semi-final switch will help ease doubts about the project's financial viability. The Cup semi-finals are on a list of nine 'prestige events', which the FA admits hold the key to Wembley being a financial success. The list also includes the FA Cup Final, Worthington Cup Final and England internationals. Stag ing these events is crucial to selling 12,800 'premium' seats at the 90,000-seat venue to big companies and wealthy individuals for up to thousands of pounds per season. WNSL is hoping to raise a staggering \u00a340m a year from executive seats, club seats, corporate hospitality and associated catering. Wembley currently generates \u00a32.8m in this way from 1,500 'fatcats'. The company says such this anticipated 14-fold increase in income is realistic as they will simply be legitimising the existing black market in unofficial hospitality packages, but FA insiders fear WNSL is being over-optimistic. Chase Manhattan, the bank which is trying to raise the \u00a3410m, has also admitted that the total cost of Wembley will be close to \u00a31 billion, and not the previously estimated \u00a3660m.

At the moment they are due to be held at a new, purpose-built athletics stadium at Picketts Lock in Edmonton, north London.

      "body": "<p>On a day when Rangers' bitter title rivals Celtic won at a canter, 6-1 against Hearts, Dick Advocaat's inconsistent side saw their hopes of adding to their tally of Scottish league championships fade further after a goalless draw at Dunfermline. </p> <p>Despite good chances for Jorg Albertz and Kenny Miller the Ibrox side could not break down a stubborn Pars defence. </p> <p>The home side also came close on a number of occasions and Rangers goalkeeper Stefan Klos, returning from injury, made a positive impact when he blocked late efforts from Youssef Rossi and Scott Thomson. </p> <p>But travelling supporters had to wait to see the German keeper in action because a power failure in the main stand meant the kick-off was delayed by 15 minutes. </p> <p>When the game eventually started the home side instantly went on the offensive, a smart one-two between Lee Bullen and Stevie Crawford epitomising Dunfermline's thoughtful attacking play. </p> <p>The visitors had their moments too, though, as one would expect of a team of their undoubted potential. Barry Ferguson had a decent chance to give Rangers an early lead but a vigilant Dunfermline defence ensured cleared his header. Then the lively Ronald de Boer released compatriot Arthur Numan down the left minutes later but the Dutchman's cross failed to connect with Miller, who was lurking in the box. </p> <p>Miller almost scored a few minutes later - Lorenzo Amoruso sent a long, hopeful ball up to the young striker on the edge of the box but goalkeeper Marco Ruitenbeek beat him to the ball. </p> <p>The Pars keeper saved his side again with a superb stop from one of Albertz's trademark bullet-straight free-kicks from 25 yards out. </p> <p>This was a frustrating time for Rangers, who enjoyed the majority of the first-half possession but found it difficult to break down Dunfermline's resolute defence. </p> <p>It was the home side who looked like scoring five minutes before the break when Chris McGroarty broke clear but he was pulled down by Tony Vidmar, who was promptly booked for the foul. </p> <p>The game's pattern continued into the second half, with Rangers creating a number of decent scoring chances. Albertz found Miller who exchanged a neat one-two with Michael Mols before bursting into the six-yard box but the Ibrox striker stumbled over the ball and the danger was cleared, albeit at the expense of a corner. </p> <p>Even Barry Ferguson was getting in on the action. He produced a rare shot on target when he smashed a terrific effort at goal from 25 yards only for Ruitenbeek to push the ball past the post.

      "bodyText": "On a day when Rangers' bitter title rivals Celtic won at a canter, 6-1 against Hearts, Dick Advocaat's inconsistent side saw their hopes of adding to their tally of Scottish league championships fade further after a goalless draw at Dunfermline. Despite good chances for Jorg Albertz and Kenny Miller the Ibrox side could not break down a stubborn Pars defence. The home side also came close on a number of occasions and Rangers goalkeeper Stefan Klos, returning from injury, made a positive impact when he blocked late efforts from Youssef Rossi and Scott Thomson. But travelling supporters had to wait to see the German keeper in action because a power failure in the main stand meant the kick-off was delayed by 15 minutes. When the game eventually started the home side instantly went on the offensive, a smart one-two between Lee Bullen and Stevie Crawford epitomising Dunfermline's thoughtful attacking play. The visitors had their moments too, though, as one would expect of a team of their undoubted potential. Barry Ferguson had a decent chance to give Rangers an early lead but a vigilant Dunfermline defence ensured cleared his header. Then the lively Ronald de Boer released compatriot Arthur Numan down the left minutes later but the Dutchman's cross failed to connect with Miller, who was lurking in the box. Miller almost scored a few minutes later - Lorenzo Amoruso sent a long, hopeful ball up to the young striker on the edge of the box but goalkeeper Marco Ruitenbeek beat him to the ball. The Pars keeper saved his side again with a superb stop from one of Albertz's trademark bullet-straight free-kicks from 25 yards out. This was a frustrating time for Rangers, who enjoyed the majority of the first-half possession but found it difficult to break down Dunfermline's resolute defence. It was the home side who looked like scoring five minutes before the break when Chris McGroarty broke clear but he was pulled down by Tony Vidmar, who was promptly booked for the foul. The game's pattern continued into the second half, with Rangers creating a number of decent scoring chances. Albertz found Miller who exchanged a neat one-two with Michael Mols before bursting into the six-yard box but the Ibrox striker stumbled over the ball and the danger was cleared, albeit at the expense of a corner. Even Barry Ferguson was getting in on the action. He produced a rare shot on target when he smashed a terrific effort at goal from 25 yards only for Ruitenbeek to push the ball past the post. Ten minutes later the persistent Albertz had another go from outside the 18-yard box but his shot was wayward. De Boer should have grabbed the opener when he pounced on a long cross from Amoruso but he fired straight at the keeper. By this stage, Advocaat must have been tearing out what little hair remains on his head. As the match entered its endgame, Rossi had the chance to put Dunfermline ahead with 15 minutes remaining, but the Moroccan's free-kick sliced through the Rangers defence only to be blocked by Klos. And with just 10 minutes to go the home team had a great chance to take the three points. Crawford released David Moss who had only the goalkeeper to beat but sent the ball wide and, as a result, sent Rangers back to Glasgow with at least a point. But considering the glut of chances that they had, a point was two less than they deserved and, more importantly, two less than Celtic. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Yesterday, the Newcastle captain was guilty of a rare and extremely costly failure from the penalty spot and the outcome was identical. </p> <p>But, as manager Bobby Robson insisted in the dressing room, there was no necessity for the apology offered by Shearer. His 82nd-minute spot-kick was not as decisive as usual, but it still required an excellent save from Thomas Sorensen to seal Sunderland's victory. </p> <p>Even Sunderland manager Peter Reid feared the worst as Shearer stepped up. 'He's normally deadly,' said Reid. 'I thought we were heading for an exciting 10 minutes at the end, but Thomas pulled off a magnificent save. He showed he's a top-class keeper.' </p> <p>Sorensen certainly won't need to buy any drinks on Wearside in the foreseeable future, although grateful supporters will have to get in the queue behind Niall Quinn. His reckless challenge on Robert Lee gifted the penalty, but Sorensen's save ensured the Quinn's winning goal will be remembered long after his foul is forgotten. </p> <p>Quinn, frustrated for much of the match by 20-year-old Steve Caldwell, directed a 12-yard header beyond keeper Shay Given in the 75th minute. The goal capped a Sunderland revival which was started when Don Hutchison - a Newcastle fan as a youngster - cancelled out an early goal by Gary Speed. The sequence was the same as last season's meeting which led to the swift departure of Gullit, although this is an immensely superior Newcastle line-up and hence a more valid success by Peter Reid's team. </p> <p>Reid said: 'My players showed tremendous character because we had to dig deep to get a foothold. I know it's still just three points, but it's a fantastic result for our fans.' </p> <p>More than 19,000 of those Sunderland fans watched the game beamed back to the Stadium of Light, but it was the 3,000 inside St. James' Park who contributed much to the occasion, including an ironic chant of 'Shearer... Shearer' towards the end. St James' Park crowds have too often been of the prawn cocktail variety this season, but this was different. A stadium which is usually only half-occupied 10 minutes before the start was full yesterday. </p> <p>The prelude to the kick-off was sufficient to underline the importance of a North East derby to players from outside the region - and there were plenty of those yesterday. Newcastle included just one local in Shearer, while Sunderland possessed two in Michael Gray and Hutchison. But the fevered atmosphere and the crowd's delirious reaction to the opening goal from Speed soon indicated this was no ordinary match. </p> <p>Speed's goal represented the perfect start for Newcastle, yet it should have been even better because the Welsh captain sliced a shot wide from an excellent position after a mere 18 seconds. Sunderland did not learn from that. Three minutes later, Speed thumped a header against a post from Nol Solano's cross and, while grounded, hooked the rebound past keeper Thomas Sorensen for his fourth goal of the season. </p> <p>Speed was pivotal in an opening half-hour when Newcastle's slicker passing and fluidity too often made Sunderland appear predictable. And Speed twice went close to further goals when his 11th-minute header was smartly saved by Sorensen and a 20-yard shot drifted wide. </p> <p>Sunderland's response to their early difficulties was relayed through Quinn - notably a ninth-minute lob was turned over by Irish team-mate Shay Given. </p> <p>Otherwise, it was a largely frustrating half for Reid's team and it prompted the manager to sacrifice defender Chris Makin for winger Julio Arca after 68 minutes. The effect was immediate - Phillips escaped Hughes and his cross was turned in by Hutchison at the far post. </p> <p>Solano hit the post from a free-kick before Sunderland broke and Quinn met Gray's left-wing cross to beat Given with a fine header. </p> <p>'You could throw 60 at Quinn from the same position and he wouldn't hit the target,' said Robson, failing to disguise his misery. 'I'm very sad, very low - I thought we would win this one. I was very confident. Alan thinks he cost us the game, but he doesn't need to apologise. This was one penalty he wouldn't want to miss.

      "body": "<p>Manchester United's early win set a challenge to Arsenal as the most likely pretenders to their championship crown. It was one that Arsene Wenger's side proved unable to handle as Everton undid them with a performance of great discipline and fierce commitment - two qualities that their much-fancied opponents were unable to match. What now of the Premiership's supposed two-horse race at the top? </p> <p>Everton's success was made all the more remarkable by the circumstances that surrounded it. Yesterday their fans were asked to decide on the club's possible relocation to the King's Dock. They are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour, and after a run of six home matches without a win such an attitude was understandable. They had failed to taste victory in this fixture since the birth of the Premiership, and with two wins in 10 games their form compared unfavourably with Arsenal's 12-match unbeaten run. On top of all that, they were missing 11 first-team players through injury or suspension. </p> <p>It never showed. Forced to defend for long periods while Arsenal dominated possession, they rarely allowed their visitors a sight of goal. 'When you've got so many players out, you've got to make sure that you work really hard,' said Walter Smith. 'I couldn't ask any more of the players, and though our defence was a rather makeshift one I felt they did very well.' </p> <p>Arsenal, too, had an unfamiliar look about them, with Alex Manninger starting in goal for the first time this season and six first-team players left at home ahead of Wednesday's Champions League match against Spartak Moscow. But they still fielded a team of 10 full internationals plus Ashley Cole, whose time will surely come. 'It's not an excuse, either for us or for them, if we have players out,' insisted Wenger. 'We just didn't do enough going forward. We always had the ball but never looked dangerous. It's a problem we also had against Derby. We are not so sharp at the moment.' </p> <p>'Not so sharp' can more accurately be read as 'completely lacking invention'. Of all their attackers - and they often played with four - only Sylvain Wiltord looked ready to match Everton's commitment and tireless running in kind. Dennis Bergkamp was ineffective and Kanu almost invisible. Only once, in the seventh minute, did they seriously threaten to score, as Wiltord and Kanu saw shots blocked before Fredrik Ljungberg's long-range drive was headed on to the bar by Gary Naysmith. The remarkable treble miss served only to instil Everton's defence with more confidence. </p> <p>And so it was that, despite the imbalance of possession, once Everton took the lead they never looked likely to relinquish it. 'It was a very difficult game for us,' said Wenger. 'Everton were happy to defend and they did that very well.

      "bodyText": "Manchester United's early win set a challenge to Arsenal as the most likely pretenders to their championship crown. It was one that Arsene Wenger's side proved unable to handle as Everton undid them with a performance of great discipline and fierce commitment - two qualities that their much-fancied opponents were unable to match. What now of the Premiership's supposed two-horse race at the top? Everton's success was made all the more remarkable by the circumstances that surrounded it. Yesterday their fans were asked to decide on the club's possible relocation to the King's Dock. They are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour, and after a run of six home matches without a win such an attitude was understandable. They had failed to taste victory in this fixture since the birth of the Premiership, and with two wins in 10 games their form compared unfavourably with Arsenal's 12-match unbeaten run. On top of all that, they were missing 11 first-team players through injury or suspension. It never showed. Forced to defend for long periods while Arsenal dominated possession, they rarely allowed their visitors a sight of goal. 'When you've got so many players out, you've got to make sure that you work really hard,' said Walter Smith. 'I couldn't ask any more of the players, and though our defence was a rather makeshift one I felt they did very well.' Arsenal, too, had an unfamiliar look about them, with Alex Manninger starting in goal for the first time this season and six first-team players left at home ahead of Wednesday's Champions League match against Spartak Moscow. But they still fielded a team of 10 full internationals plus Ashley Cole, whose time will surely come. 'It's not an excuse, either for us or for them, if we have players out,' insisted Wenger. 'We just didn't do enough going forward. We always had the ball but never looked dangerous. It's a problem we also had against Derby. We are not so sharp at the moment.' 'Not so sharp' can more accurately be read as 'completely lacking invention'. Of all their attackers - and they often played with four - only Sylvain Wiltord looked ready to match Everton's commitment and tireless running in kind. Dennis Bergkamp was ineffective and Kanu almost invisible. Only once, in the seventh minute, did they seriously threaten to score, as Wiltord and Kanu saw shots blocked before Fredrik Ljungberg's long-range drive was headed on to the bar by Gary Naysmith. The remarkable treble miss served only to instil Everton's defence with more confidence. And so it was that, despite the imbalance of possession, once Everton took the lead they never looked likely to relinquish it. 'It was a very difficult game for us,' said Wenger. 'Everton were happy to defend and they did that very well. In those circumstances, it was important to get the first goal.' Given the importance of the first goal, Arsenal could have done a bit more to stop it. A long ball from Everton's left sailed over the head of Oleg Luzhny and fell at the feet of Danny Cadamarteri, a beneficiary of the home side's injury crisis. He took it past Cole with disappointing ease before calmly sidefooting past Manninger to mark his first start of the season with his first goal. Arsenal increased the tempo of their attacks in an effort to get back in the game, but Everton's lead already appeared comfortable. It became so in the 74th minute when Cadamarteri, having scored one, turned creator. Picking up the ball on the right wing, he turned away from Cole and scampered into the area before squaring to leave Kevin Campbell with a simple fin ish for his first goal against his former club.

Kanoute was one of several visitors who won the admira tion of Leeds manager O'Leary. Rio Ferdinand, who O'Leary has long been interested in, was naturally one of them. The West Ham defender will have raised his considerable stock still further after he dealt comfortably with Mark Viduka as West Ham restricted Leeds to the odd crack from long range. 'I think Rio is a good player, but so is Carrick and Cole. I wouldn't mind a few of them,' quipped O'Leary. And it wasn't just the young ones who caught the eye. 'Where do you find people like that now? They are a dying breed,' enthused Redknapp of matchwinner Winterburn. The message to Di Canio was loud and clear, and the coach trip home was no doubt a buoyant one. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>They might have been branded arrogant by Sir Alex Ferguson, but Dutch football clubs know all too well that their part to play in the future of European football is very humble indeed. PSV Eindhoven chairman Harry van Raaij is happy to explain why his brainchild - the Euro League - is not just a fancy idea sprung from the minds of a few ambitious chairmen, but a life-saving operation for the balance in European football. </p> <p>The Dutch champions waved a sad goodbye to this season's Champions League when they were beaten by Anderlecht to make way for Manchester United in group D's promotion spot. Many at PSV fear they might never again compete like they did in 1988, when they won the European Cup. The club has been presented with a gloomy scenario of continuous further decline. Their tireless, passionate chairman has been working on a plan. </p> <p>The plan is called the 'Euro League' and is - despite good intentions - hugely unpopular with fans and Uefa alike because it involves some of the biggest clubs in Europe abandoning their national leagues. To underline the urgency felt by those involved in such a drastic and unpopular move, Van Raaij quotes compatriot Johan Cruyff: 'I read in an interview once that when Cruyff was asked by his surgeon if he was ready for his open-heart surgery, he answered: \"I'd rather not have it, but I don't think I have a choice.\" That is exactly how we feel.' </p> <p>In the past 10 months, seven European clubs who feel their businesses are in danger have come together to find a way to restore the balance in European football. In October representatives of Celtic, Glasgow Rangers, Anderlecht, Benfica, Ajax, Feyenoord and PSV presented their findings to Uefa. To the frustration of Van Raaij, Europe's governing body did not particularly warm to their ideas. Van Raaij states: 'If we accept the current status quo, the smaller countries in Europe will fall behind dramatically.' </p> <p>Not so long ago any club in Europe capable of filling their stadium and nurturing their youth talent was in with a chance in the European competitions. But no longer. In the days when the sale of broadcasting rights is the most important source of income and when players as young as 17 move to wherever the best money is to be earned, clubs from countries with smaller markets are missing out. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, it is all about money. 'The only way to avoid that is if we all go back to amateur football,' says 64-year-old Van Raaij, who was financial director at PSV's founding electronics company, Philips, before he became the club's chairman four years ago. </p> <p>'The power of the media has made it virtually impossible for clubs in smaller countries to compete with clubs from Italy, Spain, England, France and Germany. In the Netherlands, clubs receive around \u00a31.5 million from the sale of broadcasting rights. In England a new deal could see them end up with 20 times as much. Already when one of my players has one good European game, there are masses of foreign clubs on the phone to buy him. And they won't be short of cash to tempt him. If top clubs in Holland and Portugal want to keep up with clubs - even relegation candidates - in England and Spain, things will need to change.' </p> <p>The idea is to set up a new 16-team competition featuring the best clubs from the smaller countries. These clubs would still play in their domestic cup tournaments and in the European cups in midweek, but abandon their national league to play their Euro League partners on Saturdays. So far Holland, Portugal, Belgium, Scotland, Denmark and Sweden have been incorporated in the plans, but other countries are desperate to get on that list. Van Raaij: 'I have been swamped with letters from Ireland, pleading to involve Irish clubs in our plans.' </p> <p>The six countries involved in the current plan would result in a potential market of \u00a350 million. Research by Oliver &amp; Ohlbaum, the bureau that was also responsible for the development of the Premier League and Champions League set-ups, has shown that the new league could raise PSV's income from broadcasting-rights sales to about \u00a315 million. </p> <p>Apart from the Euro League-partner hopefuls, there is little support for the 'deserters'. Last month Van Raaij spoke to representatives of the Dutch clubs who will be left behind in a competition deprived of its main attractions. 'They are very critical towards these plans. If I was in their shoes I would not like it either. But the Euro League will not be a closed shop. There will be some sort of promotion/relegation ruling. </p> <p>Like any other competition, the Euro League will benefit from strong feeding competitions.' Sounds nice, but with a projected total rise in revenue in both the domestic leagues and Euro League competition calculated at maximum of 50 per cent in the first three years - and with the budget of PSV rising tenfold in that period - the smaller clubs know exactly who will pay the price. </p> <p>Van Raaij had anticipated their resistance. His main frustration is the reluctance of Uefa to seriously consider the plans. 'I heard Mike Lee, Uefa's communication director, say that Uefa acknowledges our problems, but they will only negotiate with Uefa countries, not clubs. And they will only support domestic competitions. That is like going to the doctor with a belly-ache to hear him confirm that you have a serious problem without him doing anything about it,' says the disappointed Dutchman. 'They ask us to sympathise with the smaller clubs in our countries. But when did they ever ask the bigger countries in Europe to sympathise with us? The proceeds from the Champions League are not and will never be distributed equally either. </p> <p>'We are confronted with the results of a united Europe in that our costs are virtually the same as for every other club in Europe. Our income, on the other hand, is limited by the size of our market. Uefa is blocking us to react to those facts accordingly.' </p> <p>'I thought we were in talks with Uefa, but after hearing Mr Lee I can only conclude that they have not been listening. If things stay as they are, we will have to accept that in less than 10 years none of the smaller countries will compete for the European Cups. In the last eight years only one club from outside the five largest countries managed to win the Champions League (Ajax, '95). Before that more than half of the European cups were won by clubs from the smaller countries.' </p> <p>Van Raaij plans to retire from the PSV board in two years, about the time that the first Euro League clashes are scheduled to take place. 'I sincerely hope to be able to leave behind a healthy organisation with a bright future.' </p> <p>In December, Uefa will decide if there is a future for the Euro League. Half of Europe is holding its breath. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>England know better than most to be wary of setting too much store by friendlies. Was not the 'encouraging' performance in Paris in September followed a month later by the debacle against Germany at Wembley? </p> <p>Fortunately England do not have a game next month, or even the month after that, so why has everyone made such a fuss about Peter Taylor picking a different team and earning a few plaudits on Wednesday night in Turin? </p> <p>Different is about the only adjective which can properly be used, since despite all the pre-publicity and the early bedtime jokes, the side Taylor sent out to meet the Italians was hardly wet behind the ears. Every single one of the starting line-up had played for England before, and of five substitutes used the only new cap went to Seth Johnson, who almost managed to score with his first touch. </p> <p>True, Taylor gave England a new shape, but playing three at the back is only what people have been pleading for these last couple of years. Ditto Rio Ferdinand as sweeper. Full marks to Taylor for having the bravery to try it, and to Ferdinand for at least looking the part when defending, but if Rio is as good as Franco Baresi says he is then awarding him a tenth cap hardly counts as radical. Not when his teammate Frank Lampard is sitting on the bench and Joe Cole, had he been fit, would have been fogbound with the Under 21s. </p> <p>In fact, given Alan Shearer's retirement, Teddy Sheringham's non-selection under Kevin Keegan, David Seaman's inconsistency and injuries to Tony Adams, Sol Campbell, Andy Cole, Graeme Le Saux and Nigel Martyn, the difference between Taylor's Turin side and what would have passed for a normal England team a few months ago amounts to not much more than Martin Keown. </p> <p>Alan Smith would more than likely have got a game had he not been withdrawn, but as Taylor confirmed afterwards it had been his intention all along to play Ferdinand as sweeper, there might not even have been a place for Wes Brown, if, as seems likely, the experience of Gareth Southgate and Gary Neville was deemed necessary. </p> <p>Due to prevailing circumstances, an isolated friendly presided over by a caretaker manager making a point as well as cheerfully seizing his moment, Taylor could have turned out practically any side without seriously impinging on England's ability to qualify for the next World Cup. So what on earth was Terry Venables doing, moaning about failing to see the logic of 'dumping' England's senior players? 'Especially when it's pretty much guaranteed that Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson will bring them all back for the World Cup qualifiers in the spring.' </p> <p>That's the point Tel, actually. If Eriksson brings them all back they can't really have been dumped, can they? Surely the whole point of friendly fixtures, not to mention expensively recruited foreign coaches, is so that you can look forward as well as back and break the cycle of forming your next squad almost exclusively on the basis of the last. Eriksson and Tord Grip will have to look at the situation in March and decide who is playing well and who is available, and on the whole one doubts whether they saw anything on Wednesday which would dissuade them from sending for Sheringham or Adams if they so wish. But what harm can it do to know that Nick Barmby can also play the split-striker role in which Sheringham excels, that Ferdinand can look secure in the middle of a back three or that David James can get through a game without calamity? </p> <p>Like David Beckham's captaincy and Kieron Dyer's ability to find space (albeit on the flanks where he could surely have been used more effectively), these were all minor positives in England's 1-0 defeat which would have been missed had Taylor heeded Venables' advice. Experience is invaluable in big matches, but it is not the most important commodity in friendlies against half-interested Italians. 'The older players are still good players,' Taylor patiently explained. 'I just thought this was an experiment worth trying, because we had a rare opportunity.' </p> <p>Taylor did the right thing, not so much by trusting youth as by trusting his players. It is only six months, after all, since Keegan was heard complaining that England couldn't pass. Yet here they were stroking the ball around with panache, retaining possession for significant periods and putting together passing moves which occasionally reached double figures. Here was Emile Heskey, unrecognisable as the figure of fun who spent most his time on the floor in the second half against Portugal in Euro 2000, controlling Beckham's passes neatly and causing problems for some of the world's best defenders. </p> <p>How did Taylor do that? 'I didn't do anything, it was the players. I just asked them to pass the ball.

      "bodyText": "England know better than most to be wary of setting too much store by friendlies. Was not the 'encouraging' performance in Paris in September followed a month later by the debacle against Germany at Wembley? Fortunately England do not have a game next month, or even the month after that, so why has everyone made such a fuss about Peter Taylor picking a different team and earning a few plaudits on Wednesday night in Turin? Different is about the only adjective which can properly be used, since despite all the pre-publicity and the early bedtime jokes, the side Taylor sent out to meet the Italians was hardly wet behind the ears. Every single one of the starting line-up had played for England before, and of five substitutes used the only new cap went to Seth Johnson, who almost managed to score with his first touch. True, Taylor gave England a new shape, but playing three at the back is only what people have been pleading for these last couple of years. Ditto Rio Ferdinand as sweeper. Full marks to Taylor for having the bravery to try it, and to Ferdinand for at least looking the part when defending, but if Rio is as good as Franco Baresi says he is then awarding him a tenth cap hardly counts as radical. Not when his teammate Frank Lampard is sitting on the bench and Joe Cole, had he been fit, would have been fogbound with the Under 21s. In fact, given Alan Shearer's retirement, Teddy Sheringham's non-selection under Kevin Keegan, David Seaman's inconsistency and injuries to Tony Adams, Sol Campbell, Andy Cole, Graeme Le Saux and Nigel Martyn, the difference between Taylor's Turin side and what would have passed for a normal England team a few months ago amounts to not much more than Martin Keown. Alan Smith would more than likely have got a game had he not been withdrawn, but as Taylor confirmed afterwards it had been his intention all along to play Ferdinand as sweeper, there might not even have been a place for Wes Brown, if, as seems likely, the experience of Gareth Southgate and Gary Neville was deemed necessary. Due to prevailing circumstances, an isolated friendly presided over by a caretaker manager making a point as well as cheerfully seizing his moment, Taylor could have turned out practically any side without seriously impinging on England's ability to qualify for the next World Cup. So what on earth was Terry Venables doing, moaning about failing to see the logic of 'dumping' England's senior players? 'Especially when it's pretty much guaranteed that Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson will bring them all back for the World Cup qualifiers in the spring.' That's the point Tel, actually. If Eriksson brings them all back they can't really have been dumped, can they? Surely the whole point of friendly fixtures, not to mention expensively recruited foreign coaches, is so that you can look forward as well as back and break the cycle of forming your next squad almost exclusively on the basis of the last. Eriksson and Tord Grip will have to look at the situation in March and decide who is playing well and who is available, and on the whole one doubts whether they saw anything on Wednesday which would dissuade them from sending for Sheringham or Adams if they so wish. But what harm can it do to know that Nick Barmby can also play the split-striker role in which Sheringham excels, that Ferdinand can look secure in the middle of a back three or that David James can get through a game without calamity? Like David Beckham's captaincy and Kieron Dyer's ability to find space (albeit on the flanks where he could surely have been used more effectively), these were all minor positives in England's 1-0 defeat which would have been missed had Taylor heeded Venables' advice. Experience is invaluable in big matches, but it is not the most important commodity in friendlies against half-interested Italians. 'The older players are still good players,' Taylor patiently explained. 'I just thought this was an experiment worth trying, because we had a rare opportunity.' Taylor did the right thing, not so much by trusting youth as by trusting his players. It is only six months, after all, since Keegan was heard complaining that England couldn't pass. Yet here they were stroking the ball around with panache, retaining possession for significant periods and putting together passing moves which occasionally reached double figures. Here was Emile Heskey, unrecognisable as the figure of fun who spent most his time on the floor in the second half against Portugal in Euro 2000, controlling Beckham's passes neatly and causing problems for some of the world's best defenders. How did Taylor do that? 'I didn't do anything, it was the players. I just asked them to pass the ball. I told them I didn't mind how much greyer I got, but I wanted them to show what they could do, to play with confidence and try to find each other. It takes a bit of bottle to do that, to look for the right ball and not the easy one, but I was very pleased with the belief they showed. They were very calm, which does them credit. This was high-quality opposition, and they handled the situation well.' So they did, and when you consider the team Taylor could have fielded - the one with Smith, Brown, Michael Owen, Paul Scholes, Steven Gerrard, Joe Cole and Paul Robinson - there is every reason to believe England can only get better. That is not to say they would do worse by recalling what might now be termed the old guard, just that there is no point debating the matter for the next three months. There is no debate. Whoever is in charge for the next game, and the qualifiers after it, will pick whichever players he believes are up to the task. Just like Taylor did. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

At times, United have been boorish in the heat of the contest but they have the quality of winners instilled by Sir Alex Ferguson and that entails winning the one-on-one contests, physically and tactically. For a costly moment, Beckham lost his last Wednesday night. It was a lesson for him and us. England need David Beckham on the field, able to to walk away from a flashpoint, but they need a David Beckham with the spikiness to his game that makes him the winner that he is. Responsibility should not reduce effectiveness, fear of headlines that undermine his recent charm offensive must not mean him learning lessons too well. Let us hope that the captaincy inspires rather than inhibits. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "trailText": "<p>Focus on Benfica<br />Ian Ridley recalls November 7, 1991, when England's new man (then manager of Benfica) taught Arsenal a lesson.</p>",
      "byline": "Ian Ridley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was one of those cracking and crackling European nights at Highbury, optimism heavy in the North London air. Amid the anti-climactic conclusion that was to follow, though, few would have thought that it would be of such import for the future of Arsenal and indeed England nearly a decade later. </p> <p>Nine years ago this very month, Benfica were the visitors. It was the first season of a new Champions League format, the first year of English participation after the five-year Heysel ban. Arsenal had drawn 1-1 in Lisbon and hopes were high that they would qualify for the last eight, with its experimental format of two groups of four. After all, they had beaten FK Austria 6-1 here in the previous round. </p> <p>Arsenal battered the Portuguese in true George Graham style but after taking the lead, were pegged back to 1-1. In extra time, Tony Adams hit a post - 'from about a yard; the worst miss of my career', he recalls - but canny Benfica broke out to win 3-1. They were managed by none other than Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson. The Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein, now also FA vice-chairman and recently its headhunter, took note. </p> <p>It wasn't quite the footballing Road to Damascus experience that a European defeat by Red Star Belgrade proved for Bill Shankly's Liverpool in 1973, when the legend realised a change of approach was needed, but it was certainly a reference point for Dein. Graham brought Cup-Winners' Cup success to Arsenal, doggedly sticking to his guns. Dein foresaw the arrival of the Champions League expansion and knew modernisation was necessary; be there or be Tottenham Hotspur. You can bet the name of Eriksson, then settled in Italy, did more than just cross Dein's mind before he approached Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. </p> <p>Eriksson's response to his Benfica team's victory was, in hindsight, revealing. 'I was in London that night and I've never seen him more happy with a result,' says his friend of 15 years, Bryan King, the former Millwall and Coventry goalkeeper. 'It meant so much to him to beat Arsenal at Highbury. He had been there to study them training years earlier when he was a young coach. In those days, Don Howe was coaching the Arsenal side and Sven remembered all that. It was a special result for him.' </p> <p>'Physically they were stronger than us but on the ground we were the better team with the better technique,' said Eriksson himself that night, before adding. 'For 12 to 15 years I have been a great admirer of English football. I like the mentality of always attacking.' </p> <p>English football has learnt much from that banner-carrying night - Arsenal in particular - such as modifying always attacking to attacking when opportune. This season, there are three teams in the last 16; the days of the mid-Nineties when every autumn seemed to provoke debates entitled 'What's wrong with English club football?' seem distant. </p> <p>'I think our '91 team had the potential to win the European Cup,' says Adams, still Arsenal captain. 'It was partly that we had no experience after five years out, partly that it wasn't a league system then and partly impatience on our part. We met a very good Benfica team as well, remember, and two-leg ties are very unpredictable. Now, the top teams come through to the last eight, which was the idea of Uefa. </p> <p>'We had success in the Cup-Winners' Cup and we beat some of the best. Parma were at the top of their league, so were Paris St Germain. But we've got more great English teams challenging now and we are one of them. I do believe that when Manchester United won the treble, it could have been us. I believe that year we were the two best teams in Europe at the time.' </p> <p>Adams also believes that Arsenal are better equipped than ever for European competition. 'We played to our strengths in '91 and opposing teams didn't like that. There was a resilience then. Now we also have continental players with experience of Europe. There are no surprises now. Liverpool were very successful in the Seventies and Eighties with their English style and British-based players and they added a bit more. United have also done very well with that approach. I think with our players from abroad we have it as well. It's a good blend.' </p> <p>Indeed with Adams and Martin Keown in central defence, allied to a clutch of penetrative attacking players - Robert Pires proving himself especially a runner always looking to hurt the opposition - Arsenal this season could well be England's best prospect for the competition. It does depend, mind, on them converting some of their many chances again, by not spurning the scruffy goal in attempting the spectacular. </p> <p>Good enough to win the European Cup for the first time? 'Yes, but then I've said that for the last two years,' says Adams. 'Injuries and suspensions have worked against us. You've just got to keep buying the lottery ticket. It's no good having talent, you've got to have the opportunity as well. We're back in there with a great shout, a great squad and a great chance of winning it.' </p> <p>Adams acknowledges that it needed a man like Wenger to update Arsenal. 'Yes it did but I am glad we've got the players as well. The buck stops with them. I can't see Ars\u00e8ne having Stevie Morrow, Paul Davis and Ian Selley in his midfield. With the financial backing of the club he has been able to bring quality players to Arsenal. He's been allowed to encourage that and take us to another level. All due respect to Ars\u00e8ne but without that he would have had to resort to Grampus Eight coaching, telling people where to go and how to kick it.' </p> <p>According to Adams, he and Arsenal will travel to Moscow to play Spartak next Wednesday having learnt from bitter experience the huge significance of the first match in a group, draws against Lens and Fiorentina in the past two seasons being scant reward after dominating the matches and exit after the first phase resulting. </p> <p>'A very important game,' says Adams. 'They are very dangerous and they are going to be very up for the game. It's been reported that they are expecting us to be the worst team in the group, so if they are to go through, Arsenal are going to be the team they are looking to beat. </p> <p>'But we had a great start in the last phase this time around, winning in Prague and beating Lazio, and after that the pressure was off. If you don't get those results you are chasing your tail. The last couple of seasons, we went away and didn't get the points on the board early. Moscow will be a very important game from that point of view. I really believe that the first two games before Christmas, in Moscow and against Bayern Munich at home, will determine whether we will go through.' </p> <p>Adams himself expects to make the trip, having recovered from a deep-seated bruise running the length of a thigh. Much may have been made of youth in recent weeks, what with Leeds United's vibrant progress and England's promise, and the unfettered vitality can indeed be refreshing. It can also mean impatience, though, as a young Arsenal team found out those nine long years ago. </p> <p>This looks like a job for experience, just as England's World Cup games next Spring also do when it comes to Adams and company. That gleaned the hard way against Eriksson's Benfica by Graham's broadsword of a team will be needed now by Wenger's stiletto. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "It was one of those cracking and crackling European nights at Highbury, optimism heavy in the North London air. Amid the anti-climactic conclusion that was to follow, though, few would have thought that it would be of such import for the future of Arsenal and indeed England nearly a decade later. Nine years ago this very month, Benfica were the visitors. It was the first season of a new Champions League format, the first year of English participation after the five-year Heysel ban. Arsenal had drawn 1-1 in Lisbon and hopes were high that they would qualify for the last eight, with its experimental format of two groups of four. After all, they had beaten FK Austria 6-1 here in the previous round. Arsenal battered the Portuguese in true George Graham style but after taking the lead, were pegged back to 1-1. In extra time, Tony Adams hit a post - 'from about a yard; the worst miss of my career', he recalls - but canny Benfica broke out to win 3-1. They were managed by none other than Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson. The Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein, now also FA vice-chairman and recently its headhunter, took note. It wasn't quite the footballing Road to Damascus experience that a European defeat by Red Star Belgrade proved for Bill Shankly's Liverpool in 1973, when the legend realised a change of approach was needed, but it was certainly a reference point for Dein. Graham brought Cup-Winners' Cup success to Arsenal, doggedly sticking to his guns. Dein foresaw the arrival of the Champions League expansion and knew modernisation was necessary; be there or be Tottenham Hotspur. You can bet the name of Eriksson, then settled in Italy, did more than just cross Dein's mind before he approached Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Eriksson's response to his Benfica team's victory was, in hindsight, revealing. 'I was in London that night and I've never seen him more happy with a result,' says his friend of 15 years, Bryan King, the former Millwall and Coventry goalkeeper. 'It meant so much to him to beat Arsenal at Highbury. He had been there to study them training years earlier when he was a young coach. In those days, Don Howe was coaching the Arsenal side and Sven remembered all that. It was a special result for him.' 'Physically they were stronger than us but on the ground we were the better team with the better technique,' said Eriksson himself that night, before adding. 'For 12 to 15 years I have been a great admirer of English football. I like the mentality of always attacking.' English football has learnt much from that banner-carrying night - Arsenal in particular - such as modifying always attacking to attacking when opportune. This season, there are three teams in the last 16; the days of the mid-Nineties when every autumn seemed to provoke debates entitled 'What's wrong with English club football?' seem distant. 'I think our '91 team had the potential to win the European Cup,' says Adams, still Arsenal captain. 'It was partly that we had no experience after five years out, partly that it wasn't a league system then and partly impatience on our part. We met a very good Benfica team as well, remember, and two-leg ties are very unpredictable. Now, the top teams come through to the last eight, which was the idea of Uefa. 'We had success in the Cup-Winners' Cup and we beat some of the best. Parma were at the top of their league, so were Paris St Germain. But we've got more great English teams challenging now and we are one of them. I do believe that when Manchester United won the treble, it could have been us. I believe that year we were the two best teams in Europe at the time.' Adams also believes that Arsenal are better equipped than ever for European competition. 'We played to our strengths in '91 and opposing teams didn't like that. There was a resilience then. Now we also have continental players with experience of Europe. There are no surprises now. Liverpool were very successful in the Seventies and Eighties with their English style and British-based players and they added a bit more. United have also done very well with that approach. I think with our players from abroad we have it as well. It's a good blend.' Indeed with Adams and Martin Keown in central defence, allied to a clutch of penetrative attacking players - Robert Pires proving himself especially a runner always looking to hurt the opposition - Arsenal this season could well be England's best prospect for the competition. It does depend, mind, on them converting some of their many chances again, by not spurning the scruffy goal in attempting the spectacular. Good enough to win the European Cup for the first time? 'Yes, but then I've said that for the last two years,' says Adams. 'Injuries and suspensions have worked against us. You've just got to keep buying the lottery ticket. It's no good having talent, you've got to have the opportunity as well. We're back in there with a great shout, a great squad and a great chance of winning it.' Adams acknowledges that it needed a man like Wenger to update Arsenal. 'Yes it did but I am glad we've got the players as well. The buck stops with them. I can't see Ars\u00e8ne having Stevie Morrow, Paul Davis and Ian Selley in his midfield. With the financial backing of the club he has been able to bring quality players to Arsenal. He's been allowed to encourage that and take us to another level. All due respect to Ars\u00e8ne but without that he would have had to resort to Grampus Eight coaching, telling people where to go and how to kick it.' According to Adams, he and Arsenal will travel to Moscow to play Spartak next Wednesday having learnt from bitter experience the huge significance of the first match in a group, draws against Lens and Fiorentina in the past two seasons being scant reward after dominating the matches and exit after the first phase resulting. 'A very important game,' says Adams. 'They are very dangerous and they are going to be very up for the game. It's been reported that they are expecting us to be the worst team in the group, so if they are to go through, Arsenal are going to be the team they are looking to beat. 'But we had a great start in the last phase this time around, winning in Prague and beating Lazio, and after that the pressure was off. If you don't get those results you are chasing your tail. The last couple of seasons, we went away and didn't get the points on the board early. Moscow will be a very important game from that point of view. I really believe that the first two games before Christmas, in Moscow and against Bayern Munich at home, will determine whether we will go through.' Adams himself expects to make the trip, having recovered from a deep-seated bruise running the length of a thigh. Much may have been made of youth in recent weeks, what with Leeds United's vibrant progress and England's promise, and the unfettered vitality can indeed be refreshing. It can also mean impatience, though, as a young Arsenal team found out those nine long years ago. This looks like a job for experience, just as England's World Cup games next Spring also do when it comes to Adams and company. That gleaned the hard way against Eriksson's Benfica by Graham's broadsword of a team will be needed now by Wenger's stiletto. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p> It's not how you expect a child to react to the Disney experience. 'Mum! Get me out of here,' 10-year-old Harriet hissed urgently, pushing her face into my side. Mind you, we were in pitch darkness, maniacal laughter and screeching was coming from somewhere much too close and we were crammed into a small, shuddering room shoulder to shoulder with strangers whose faces we could picture even though we couldn't actually see them because we had had 45 minutes to study them in the queue for spooky Phantom Manor. </p> <p>'It's fine,' I said firmly. 'It's fun.' A disbelieving snort came from the depths of my jacket. I just had time to wonder if this had been a good choice for our first Disneyland Paris ride when the doors were flung open and we were ushered into cars to set off through the haunted house. </p> <p>And it was amazing. When we finally emerged, we were total converts to the power of Disney. Our main reason for going to the park was to experience Christmas Disney-style and we had already submitted completely to the illusion it was the festive season - despite its being only the middle of November in the outside world. </p> <p>And that's what Disneyland Paris is - another world. If you took the Eurostar from Waterloo straight to the park itself - which is an option - it would be easy not to realise you were in France. (All the staff smile and smile and smile. There was one exception; a woman who served us ice cream with the sullen rudeness only ever achieved by French shop assistants. And quite honestly, it was refreshing to see that Disney has not completely broken the local spirit.) Harriet and I travelled by Eurostar to Paris and then got a coach to the Hotel New York, where we were staying for a couple of nights, just five minutes' walk from the park. The hotel, with its Art Deco bedrooms, was very comfortable and bedecked with Christmas trees.

We dumped our bags and raced for the park. It was late afternoon and, as dusk fell, the myriad lights across the park, down Main Street USA and round the Sleeping Beauty's castle twinkled and shimmered.

But you'd have to be a complete curmudgeon to go to Disneyland at Christmas and not feel festive. </p> <p>The Christmas parade is a terrific spectacle based on the Nutcracker theme with huge floats and dancers in amazing costumes making their way up Main Street. We got there early enough to get places right on the pavement and it was well worth the wait as the parade takes a good while to pass by. The same principle applies to the rides; the queues are long enough for you not to want to commit to more than about three a day, but they are always worth the wait. </p> <p>Later we attended the lighting of the huge Christmas tree in the main square. Twilight came and the illuminations down Main Street glowed and sparkled. Father Christmas arrived in a sleigh drawn by real reindeer. A child picked from the crowd threw golden pixie dust up at the tree (it was actually only small shreds of golden paper as you could see afterwards when it lay on the ground, but as it rose through the sky it seemed to multiply and shimmer in a way that made the crowd gasp.

Mind you, we were in pitch darkness, maniacal laughter and screeching was coming from somewhere much too close and we were crammed into a small, shuddering room shoulder to shoulder with strangers whose faces we could picture even though we couldn't actually see them because we had had 45 minutes to study them in the queue for spooky Phantom Manor. 'It's fine,' I said firmly. 'It's fun.' A disbelieving snort came from the depths of my jacket. I just had time to wonder if this had been a good choice for our first Disneyland Paris ride when the doors were flung open and we were ushered into cars to set off through the haunted house. And it was amazing. When we finally emerged, we were total converts to the power of Disney. Our main reason for going to the park was to experience Christmas Disney-style and we had already submitted completely to the illusion it was the festive season - despite its being only the middle of November in the outside world. And that's what Disneyland Paris is - another world. If you took the Eurostar from Waterloo straight to the park itself - which is an option - it would be easy not to realise you were in France. (All the staff smile and smile and smile. There was one exception; a woman who served us ice cream with the sullen rudeness only ever achieved by French shop assistants. And quite honestly, it was refreshing to see that Disney has not completely broken the local spirit.) Harriet and I travelled by Eurostar to Paris and then got a coach to the Hotel New York, where we were staying for a couple of nights, just five minutes' walk from the park. The hotel, with its Art Deco bedrooms, was very comfortable and bedecked with Christmas trees. Icicles hung from the ceiling of a silvery snow tunnel which served as the entrance to a huge dining room that had been turned into a winter wonderland for our dinner and a show that evening. Imagination, illusion and - there's no denying it - magic is everywhere at Disneyland, especially if you're with a child. We dumped our bags and raced for the park.

It's a cold, bright Saturday morning and the sunlight reflecting off the well-worn cobbles makes it difficult to see without squinting. </p> <p>To my right are the Kremlin walls, which allow only tantalising glimpses of the palaces and golden cupolas within. To my left are the elegant arcades of GUM, the first Soviet department store.

Street vendors laden with Russian Army hats stand around smoking and waiting for business. And that's when it hits me. Where are all the tourists? </p> <p>This must surely be one of the most impressive squares in any city. Maybe not the most beautiful but the vast, rolling expanse of it and the resonance of recent history are enough to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. A day's sightseeing here can range from the sublime - notably the eye-bulging collection of jewels and Faberg\u00e9 eggs in the Kremlin's Armoury - to the vaguely ridiculous (though it's meant to be solemn) experience of visiting Lenin's embalmed body, which is creepy and surreal from start to finish. </p> <p>While I would rather queue for 20 minutes in the cold to see a dead Socialist leader than stand for one minute in the sunshine watching a motionless mime artist pretending to be a statue on Barcelona's Ramblas, most people would not. Which explains why there are more British tourists in Barcelona than in Moscow on this and, indeed, most weekends. </p> <p>In an attempt to reverse declining numbers of foreign tourists (put off by reports of soaring street crime and the war with Chechnya) the Moscow City Government has decided to make the Russian capital - and its people - more welcoming for visitors. Within the next two years, Moscow will open its first tourist information centre and create 20 landscaped 'tourist zones' with cafes, toilets, benches, signposting and souvenir shops. It will also train a special tourist police force, which will patrol visitor hotspots, such as the Kremlin and Red Square, offering assistance and peace of mind to visitors. </p> <p> There are also plans to build more three-star hotels to bridge the accommodation gap between Soviet-era monstrosities such as the 6,000 room Hotel Rossia and the luxurious five-star Hotel Baltschug Kempinski which sit facing each other on opposite banks of the Moskva River. The new tourism strategy goes far beyond the cosmetic: it will also attempt to get under the skin of the Russian people with a government-sponsored campaign to teach the citizens of Moscow to smile. Not at each other, because they do that anyway, but at tourists. </p> <p>The idea goes something like this: rather than drumming their fingers impatiently on the counter, shopkeepers will help customers as they fumble to count out their roubles. Instead of blank stares, policemen will happily give directions to lost tourists and taxi drivers will resist the urge to wheel-spin off into the distance as new and bemused arrivals stutter over unpronounceable street names. </p> <p>'It's a very serious issue,' says Sergei Ananov, deputy chairman of Moscow City Government's tourism committee. 'People need to change mentally. This campaign will educate Muscovites to raise their sense of hospitality and teach them that tourists are good for the economy.' </p> <p> This drive to attract tourists is all part of a wider strategy by the energetic Mayor Yuri Luzhkov to revitalise the city centre, which has encompassed everything from filling in potholes to major building projects, ranging in scope from Russia's first Ikea store (causing three-hour traffic tailbacks as Russians clamoured for their first encounter with flat-pack furniture) to the imposing Church of Christ the Saviour, Moscow's largest cathedral. Originally built to commemorate Napoleon's expulsion in 1812, it was destroyed by Stalin in 1931 to make way for the Palace of the Soviets, a colossal skyscraper which was to be dominated by a 300ft statue of Lenin.

But he died four years ago aged 94, and so must spend the evening in Moscow's Vankangovskoye cemetery. </p> <p>Starostin deserves better: he virtually made Spartak. </p> <p>Born in 1902, son of a hunter who died in a typhoid epidemic, Starostin fed his younger brothers by playing ice hockey in the winter and football in the summer. He captained his country at both sports, and in 1935 gave Spartak Moscow its name. </p> <p>In the late 1930s, the peak of the Soviet purges, a Spartak team starring the four Starostin brothers won three league titles. However, this displeased Lavrenti Beria, Stalin's terrible secret police chief, who happened to be president of the Dynamo Moscow club. </p> <p>Starostin spent years waiting to be arrested. At last, one night in 1942, he was awoken by a torch shining into his eyes and two pistols pointed at his head. He was taken to the Lubyanka, the secret police headquarters, where he was interrogated for two years and told that he had plotted to murder Stalin. </p> <p>The charges were eventually dropped - that there had been no attempt to kill Stalin was a problem - but Starostin and his brothers were nonetheless tried and found guilty. However, they were given just ten years in Siberia each. This was considered such a mild sentence it was practically a let-off.

      "bodyText": "Nikolai Starostin wishes he could be at the Luzhniki Stadium on Wednesday when Spartak Moscow play Arsenal. But he died four years ago aged 94, and so must spend the evening in Moscow's Vankangovskoye cemetery. Starostin deserves better: he virtually made Spartak. Born in 1902, son of a hunter who died in a typhoid epidemic, Starostin fed his younger brothers by playing ice hockey in the winter and football in the summer. He captained his country at both sports, and in 1935 gave Spartak Moscow its name. In the late 1930s, the peak of the Soviet purges, a Spartak team starring the four Starostin brothers won three league titles. However, this displeased Lavrenti Beria, Stalin's terrible secret police chief, who happened to be president of the Dynamo Moscow club. Starostin spent years waiting to be arrested. At last, one night in 1942, he was awoken by a torch shining into his eyes and two pistols pointed at his head. He was taken to the Lubyanka, the secret police headquarters, where he was interrogated for two years and told that he had plotted to murder Stalin. The charges were eventually dropped - that there had been no attempt to kill Stalin was a problem - but Starostin and his brothers were nonetheless tried and found guilty. However, they were given just ten years in Siberia each. This was considered such a mild sentence it was practically a let-off. 'The future seemed not so gloomy after all,' he gloated in Football Through the Years, the memoir he published when he was 87. He knows why he got off lightly. 'The Starostins did not exist by themselves. In people's minds they personified Spartak. Beria had to deal with the hopes of millions of fans, ordinary Soviet people.' For Spartak was, and is, a special Russian football club. Dynamo was the club of the KGB, CSKA of the army, and Torpedo of the Zil car plant, while to this day Lokomotiv Moscow are still funded by the railways ministry.

      "body": "<p>Back in the old days when Manchester United were still coming to terms with the Champions League, they used to arrive at the mid-point break desperately grateful for the chance to give the Premiership their undivided attention. </p> <p>A mere four years ago a 2-0 victory over Rapid Vienna saw chairman Martin Edwards practically cracking open the champagne as he explained that United had won themselves not just a place in the quarter-finals but a whole three months breathing space. As Old Trafford had just witnessed its first European defeats in that campaign, not once but twice as first Fenerbahce then Juventus left Manchester with a single goal and all three points, one could easily understand Edwards's relief. His domestic concerns were justified too - United ended up winning the Premiership by a comfortable margin from Newcastle but could only fit all their fixtures in by playing the last four matches in nine days - though their European adventure that season was ended at the semi-final stage by Ottmar Hitzfeld's Borussia Dortmund. </p> <p>How much has changed in four years? Well, in 1996 David Beckham was only just breaking into England's side and was not widely regarded as a future captain. Eric Cantona was the player entrusted with the almost total responsibility of making United tick. Paul Scholes had not yet gained his first cap, Teddy Sheringham was still at Spurs, and, with Gary Pallister, the Neville brothers were the most regular England internationals.Virtually everything has changed, in other words, including the Champions League format, the size of the United squad deemed necessary to cope with it, even the club's philosophy about whether it is a core domestic or European player seems subtly to have shifted. </p> <p>The last four years have seen Beckham survive lionisation by his own supporters and vilification from everyone else to establish his name as something approaching a global brand. Roy Keane has returned from serious injury to calm down, pick up player of the year plaudits and learn to save his scorn for remote supporters rather than rulebound referees. Scholes has fulfilled his potential and more, a singular Danish goalkeeper has given way to an idiosyncratic French one and Continental defenders like Jaap Stam and Mikael Silvestre have been assimilated. United can sign whoever they want now; should they ever need to replace Ryan Giggs, Dwight Yorke or Andy Cole they can just go shopping for a new superstar, always assuming he passes the medical. But they will never turn into FC Hollywood as long as managers keep picking the Neville brothers, and there is every indication they will continue to do so for some time. </p> <p>The Nevilles' claim to be the great unsung heroes of Old Trafford could perhaps be disputed by Denis Irwin, who could challenge a clockwork train set for reliability, ease of maintenance and inconspicuousness when not in use, but the Irishman's long and illustrious career is beginning to wind down. Sir Alex Ferguson has started using him sparingly, resting him whenever he can, and there have been occasions, particularly in Europe, when Irwin has been caught on the turn and exposed for pace. Irwin might be making his final bows around the same time as his manager, whereas there is little doubt the Nevilles will be going strong for the new man. </p> <p>There is no danger of the next manager failing to recognise the virtues of two of the most consistent performers in the Premiership. Everyone wanted to rave about Rio Ferdinand in Turin on Wednesday, even though England's sweeper had only contributed the defensive part of his brief and been content to let Beckham come back and carry the ball out of defence, but Peter Taylor was quick to set the record straight. 'Rio is getting a lot of credit, but I think he would be the first one to thank Gary Neville and Gareth Southgate for the solid support,' Taylor said. 'It must have been a big help to be playing between such experienced international defenders.' </p> <p>With 41 caps in his 25 years, that is exactly what Gary now is. His ability to switch seamlessly between full back and central defence makes him an almost priceless commodity in England and United squads. United play a rigid 4-4-2 but utilise Neville in either position. He has long been England's preferred right-back, but even if the switch to 5-3-2 becomes permanent there is little doubt the caps will continue as a member of the back three. Gary Neville may not be the most demonstrative or flamboyant England international, but good defenders rarely need to be conspicuous. </p> <p>When they are, it is usually for the wrong reasons, as younger brother Phil found to his cost with England last summer. There is no need to go over the penalty drama against Romania in Charleroi again, suffice to say England's stand-in left-back paid a heavy price for a single mistake. The most unfair aspect was that Phil Neville was somehow left to bear the brunt of all England's failings, as if it were his fault Graeme le Saux was injured, that the country could not provide any left-footed alternatives, or that Kevin Keegan kept insisting on a formation which was bound to show up the side's lack of balance sooner or later. </p> <p>To his credit, Phil Neville has responded in exactly the same way Beckham applied himself after a similar distraction two years ago - by keeping his head down and concentrating on what he does best. Neville does not have the sizzling free-kicks and pinpoint crosses in his repertoire to redeem himself as instantly as Beckham, though his selfless overlaps to give his teammate a passing option and take a defender with him should not be underestimated. What can be safely said is that though friends were initially worried about his possible reaction to England criticism, no excuses have had to be advanced on his behalf at any stage of the season. The subject is closed, the episode behind him. </p> <p>United's main defensive worry, as Panathinaikos arrive to start the Champions League' second stage, continues to be the absence of Stam. Or rather, what to do about it. Ronny Johnsen's fitness continues to be erratic, Wes Brown is still playing himself back after cruciate surgery and Silvestre is still prone to expensive aberrations. Good thing the Nevilles are around, really. Few frills, but few question marks either. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>As Mark Viduka chews the fat about football, the universe and everything with the kind of self-possessed ease Australians are famed for, it doesn't seem possible that he could feel so messed up he would run away from it all. But his most infamous move so far in British football was to turn on his heels and abandon Celtic days after signing for them two seasons ago: as a result he is perceived by some as temperamental, sensitive, and unstable. What a misconception. </p> <p>Leeds United striker Viduka is so easygoing you can't help but feel relaxed in his company. He makes signing autographs and posing for snaps look like he's catching up with an old friend. His mates tell you he's utterly unchanged and - with an open smile and an 'all right mate' on the tip of his tongue - he comes across as blissfully oblivious to the trappings of fame. He isn't. He has just learned the hard way that the star system is a fickle mistress best avoided. As he says, 'I have seen how it is to go from superstar to everybody hates you. People will do whatever they want around you but you have to stay level.' </p> <p>The background to his disappearing act is a situation beyond the comprehension of your average British footballer. He joined Celtic from Croatia Zagreb, a period of his professional and personal life embroiled with so much complexity and anxiety it made him fall out of love with the game. He had been invited to Zagreb as a teenager when he was making waves as a young footballer of immense promise Down Under. The calling came from the president of the club - who also happened to be the president of the country. The late Franjo Tudjman was on an official visit to Australia and was told that the sensation who had been top scorer in the Australian league for two seasons running was of Croatian descent. Viduka and his parents went to meet Tudjman for lunch in Melbourne and, feeling 'honoured and flattered', he was soon on his way, making the opposite journey taken by mum and dad in the Sixties. </p> <p>Croatian traditions had been a large part of his upbringing - it was the first language he spoke - but he was so ingrained in the Australian lifestyle that Zagreb's greeting amounted to a huge culture shock. 'When my parents came to Australia they came because they had no money, they were poor, at that time it was a communist system and it wasn't a free place. It's a battle: you come to a new country, you don't know the language, don't know where you're going to sleep. When I went to Croatia I was all right because I had a job and I got paid pretty well. But it was tough because I was 19 and I came to a place in transition between communism and democracy. For me, being in a place where the people had the communist mentality was difficult because I'd lived in a free country all my life. You see how people think and react differently. It was very, very stressful.' </p> <p>'The situation is so bad over there people are struggling to live. They earn something like $100 a month and you can't live on that. Also people have a lot of social problems, having lost a lot of relatives and limbs in the war. Where my father was from was occupied for about four years in the early Nineties and it was taken over. They killed my grandmother's brother and her son. So...' He pauses and reflects. </p> <p>Life for Viduka on the field was also alien to a boy bred in a country where sport is a positive thread in the fabric of society. Playing for the team seen as an arm of the government because of the President's patronage meant political hatred was rife. Opponents resented what was seen as favouritism and complained of corruption, and even the club's own supporters railed against them because Tudjman had changed the name from 'Dynamo' to 'Croatia' Zagreb, in an attempt to make them the national club. They felt their heritage was being betrayed and wanted vengeance. </p> <p>'Marko' Viduka, who had gone there merely wanting to play football, was mystified: 'I remember leaving the ground and the home crowd were cheering for the other team the whole game. It was politically motivated. Towards the end of my time there, because of my involvement with the President, people were having a go at me. It was hard because I would go out and play, and I remember one game where, before I even started, there were 40,000 people singing \"Viduka's a pooftah\" or something like that. My own fans! It's not a very nice situation to be in. There was a game when I was man of the match and after I scored a really good goal they were booing me. So it's not a normal situation to be in. I wasn't motivated to play. I was confused, thinking what have I got to do to have a normal situation? It turned me off football. I was happy to go. Moving to Britain was refreshing. People are just interested in football, not politics.' </p> <p>Enter Celtic, and the relief of a fresh opportunity. But when his transfer became prolonged - it kept stalling on the way the fee would be divvied up between Croatia Zagreb and Viduka's signing on fee - he'd suddenly had enough. So he fled to the sanctuary of his family in Melbourne for a two-month sabbatical to get his head together. </p> <p>The Scottish media painted him as another Paolo Di Canio permanently on the brink of explosion. He feels unfairly misrepresented. 'In that respect it was a bad place to go to because the Scottish press are mental up there,' he muses. 'They made up so many things, they said I was in an asylum and went to some cuckoo place. It was ridiculous. I had three training sessions before I went and they said somebody kicked me so I got upset and went home!' He laughs at the lunacy of it all. As if. </p> <p>Viduka, as Leeds have recently come to realise, is anything but a cowardly player. His critics in Scotland had to acknowledge it too, considering he finished last season there as top scorer and Players' Player of the Year. </p> <p>Whilst in Glasgow he took particular interest in the fortunes of Leeds, because Harry Kewell is his mate, and his impact since joining him in Yorkshire has been dramatic. He has bought a new dimension to the team. Although last season at Elland Road was immensely promising, you couldn't help wondering how much more could have been achieved had they not lost Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Granted, the exuberant efforts of Alan Smith and Michael Bridges went a long way to filling a gaping hole, but Leeds still needed a free-scoring, line-leading spearhead; a forward with supreme self- confidence; a striker with a proven record and presence. </p> <p>It took Viduka a while to find his rhythm. Just as his talents blossomed at Celtic after a false start, Leeds have also felt the benefits of his penchant for invigorating himself with a few deep breaths of Aussie air. Before returning for the Olympics he looked, as one Leeds sup porter so delicately put it, like he had been on the Tomas Brolin diet. Short of fitness, they reckoned David O'Leary had bought a hulking, workaday number nine who would hopefully nick the kind of scrappy goals so alien to the works of art favoured by Harry Kewell and Michael Bridges. Those expectations have been exceeded in spades. </p> <p>'When I first arrived I wasn't scoring goals, which was basically due to lack of fitness. I had been out for three months and had done nothing. For me, I'm a big bloke and I really need to get fit. I have to do a really good pre-season just to get my lungs and my engines going. This pre-season I signed for Leeds and had to wait a week for my work permit while the boys were all training. </p> <p>'Then I injured my ankle and was out for another three weeks. Even in the Olympics I didn't feel fit, I couldn't recover after runs and stuff. How did it turn around? I scored some goals, that's how it is in my game. </p> <p>'For some reason when I came back I felt good. When you're confident you can be standing on the edge of the box, somebody kicks the ball, it hits your arse and goes in. But you work on confidence. It comes with training and that's where I try to give 100 per cent in training because if I do it there I'm going to do it in the game as well.' </p> <p>That confidence glowed during that astounding, virtuoso four-goal show against Liverpool. Afterwards he deliberately decided to duck out of the limelight, wary of the pitfalls of being portrayed as the main man in a team game. Personally and professionally, preening is not his style. Pat Rafter, commenting on what is expected of Australian sportsmen, summed it up succinctly: 'Australians are very laid back people, very approachable people. If any athletes aren't that way they are generally perceived as dickheads.' It's a sentiment Viduka fully subscribes to. </p> <p>During the Socceroos successful jaunt at Hampden Park for last week's international, the spotlight of attention focused so intensely on Viduka it virtually blacked out the rest of the squad. It would have been embarrassing were they not all so chummy about it. There is a general acceptance that 'Duks' as he is known to his team-mates, is worthy of special treatment. As fellow striker Paul Agostino pointed out, 'He gets a lot of attention but to me it's fair because he's a world-class player and he deserves everything that he gets.' </p> <p>There wasn't a trace of jealousy or sarcasm in his voice, even though he has a superior goals-to-games record for his country than Viduka. Agostino admires the fact that while he made it to Europe on the back of hard work and aggression, Viduka's break was based on the kind of natural skill and flair other players can only wish for. He is one of the shining lights who give the Socceroos credibility. They are all desperate to take that further by qualifying for the next World Cup. David O'Leary might baulk at the thought of every call-up but Viduka won't fail the cause. </p> <p>He is blossoming vibrantly in the Premiership. So much that Australia coach Frank Farina reckons Viduka would fetch in the region of \u00a320 million today, five months after Leeds paid a mere \u00a36 m. On the majestic form epitomised by that quartet against Liverpool, he could pick his world club if he wanted to. </p> <p>It's easy to get carried away by one mesmerising performance but, as Farina points out, he's been on a permanent hot streak since childhood. 'He was scoring a lot of goals as a teenager in Australia and when he left a lot of people doubted he would score goals in Croatia. Sure enough he ended up top scorer there two or three years in a row. Then he went to Scotland, and then on to England, and the same doubts cropped up again. But Mark Viduka keeps scoring goals. It's a God-given talent. He's a very big man but he's very quick on his feet and he has a gift for goals, which makes him a perfect centre forward.' </p> <p>Viduka was a born goalscorer. When he was nine he struck 13 times in a single match, and he has barely stopped since. His consistency is remarkable. If it can continue, the prospect of his burgeoning partnership with Alan Smith being reinforced by the attacking urges of Harry Kewell, Michael Bridges and Jason Wilcox, when they recover from injury, promises exciting times ahead. </p> <p>Viduka, who 'can't wait' to play with compatriot Kewell, enthuses about his new club's prospects. 'We're really good, and when we get the players back and we have the depth in the squad and have to start competing for spots, that's when you get the best out of these players.' </p> <p>Past experiences give him the perspective to realise how exhilarating his football at Elland Road can be. Although he lives for the present he doesn't forget what he saw along the way. Viduka is proud that a stand at his first club, Melbourne Knights, was built by the money trickling though from his transfers and bears his name. He also remains bonded to Croatia - he and his Zagreb-born girlfriend have Croatian television at home and he watches it every day. His extraordinary exploits around the globe stay with him, constantly inspiring his hopes for the future. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>A young South African man was talking to a woman selling fruit in the main street of a northern Tanzanian village. 'Do you think you could make one of these?', he asked in rapid Swahili, holding up a lidded box, a simple frame covered with woven banana leaves. 'I'll try,' she replied. 'Come back in a couple of days.' </p> <p>Jean Du Plessis makes many similar calls in Mto wa Mbu (Mosquito River) near Lake Manyara in his quest to provide some income for the local tribeswomen. 'It's difficult to believe, but there is a litter problem in the Serengeti,' he said. 'People go on game drives and just dump their cardboard and plastic picnic boxes. I'm trying to persuade the local women to make boxes from banana leaves that are biodegradable or that the tourists will want to take home. That way everybody wins: the environment and the people.' </p> <p>Two days later we returned to the fruit seller and a perfect replica of the original had been turned out. 'It took me a whole day,' she said, 'but I think I will get faster. I could probably make about three a day.' That would represent about an extra \u00a32 a day for her family; not much, but significant in a nation where the average wage is only \u00a335 a month. </p> <p>Du Plessis, a 26-year-old former ranger, wants Tanzanians to share in the prosperity that big game tourism is bringing to the country, but to do it in a way that does not harm the environment. Going on an African safari is hugely rewarding, he says, but looking at animals from inside a Land-Rover is a bit like sitting in a goldfish bowl; your feet literally never touch the ground, and after a few days you can feel strangely detached from the real Africa and its people. </p> <p>Serena Active, Du Plessis's new arm of the Serena hotels and lodges group, aims to connect the safari-goer with the landscape and culture. He leads fascinating walks through Mto wa Mbu, describing the crops and meeting and talking to the locals who greet him with undisguised pleasure. These are not Disneyesque 'cultural experiences': no one tries to sell trinkets or entice you into their rudimentary shops; this is a real opportunity to learn about an almost medieval way of life. </p> <p>We were welcomed by Bibi, an 80-year-old woman who showed us her home; an earth-floored, mud-walled, banana leaf-thatched hut, which she shared with her daughters and numerous grandchildren; children who would benefit directly from the walk we were taking that morning. Some of the profits from the \u00a328-a-head charge go directly to the village. So far Jean has spent about \u00a3250 building a kindergarten out of local timber with a \u00a3350 concrete toilet block. Eighty children are taught in three sessions every day by a dedicated teacher part-funded by the walking project. </p> <p>A few days later we sped down the Rift Valley escarpment on a 10-mile mountain bike ride that took us through the village again. Children ran out to greet us and stare at these strange creatures in helmets and backpacks. It was election day and the kindergarten, just like any school in Britain, had been turned into a polling station; a patient, humbling queue forming outside. We rode out to the Masai tribesmen's land on the banks of the lake where young children drove cattle herds 300-strong on to fresh pasture and maribou storks and brilliantly-coloured bee-eaters wheeled overhead in the warm air. The day before we had hiked for three hours with Du Plessis's partner, Megan Craft, amid the stunning scenery surrounding the Ngorongoro crater, a 100-square-mile caldera, formed nearly three million years ago. </p> <p>We walked away from the crater and up the slopes of Mt Oldeani, passing cattle and goats kicking up clouds of red dust on their way down to drink. We encountered Masai tribesmen, visible for miles in their bright red tunics and armed only with spear and staff. This is a national park and home to all the wild animals of Africa; lion, cheetah, leopard, elephant, buffalo, rhino. While the area we walked was deemed to be away from their normal habitats, each hike is accompanied by an armed park ranger - just in case - but the fearless Masai put their trust in their mystic red and their spears. </p> <p>We had spent the previous day and that morning in a Land-Rover, touring the crater, marvelling at the huge variety of wildlife, and were ready to stretch our legs. Leading the trek was Tim Mdinka, one of the seven staff employed by Serena Active who act as guides on walks and bike rides, bringing their local knowledge to bear when describing the dramatic landscape, the animals , the plants and the trees. Tim told us about life in Tanzania; how education is compulsory from seven to 14 , but how few go on after that; how families are still having eight to 10 children each; how the Masai honour their cattle (the larger the herd, the higher the status of the herdsman). He stooped down and picked some objects off the ground. 'Here, have these,' he said, handing them to my younger son Nicholas, 'they're zebra teeth.' </p> <p>A little later he stooped again and picked up something bright; a carefully worked tool, like an arrow head. 'Something from a witchdoctor, I think,' he said and added it to Nicholas's collection. </p> <p>Over the final ridge we watched the sun set over Lake Eyasi, a lovely sight made even lovelier by a glass of champagne supplied from a Land-Rover waiting to drive us back through the dark to the Ngorongoro Serena lodge. Far below us on the banks of the lake live the 500 members of the Hutza tribe - hunter-gatherers who wear animal skins and eat baboons.

      "bodyText": "A young South African man was talking to a woman selling fruit in the main street of a northern Tanzanian village. 'Do you think you could make one of these?', he asked in rapid Swahili, holding up a lidded box, a simple frame covered with woven banana leaves. 'I'll try,' she replied. 'Come back in a couple of days.' Jean Du Plessis makes many similar calls in Mto wa Mbu (Mosquito River) near Lake Manyara in his quest to provide some income for the local tribeswomen. 'It's difficult to believe, but there is a litter problem in the Serengeti,' he said. 'People go on game drives and just dump their cardboard and plastic picnic boxes. I'm trying to persuade the local women to make boxes from banana leaves that are biodegradable or that the tourists will want to take home. That way everybody wins: the environment and the people.' Two days later we returned to the fruit seller and a perfect replica of the original had been turned out. 'It took me a whole day,' she said, 'but I think I will get faster. I could probably make about three a day.' That would represent about an extra \u00a32 a day for her family; not much, but significant in a nation where the average wage is only \u00a335 a month. Du Plessis, a 26-year-old former ranger, wants Tanzanians to share in the prosperity that big game tourism is bringing to the country, but to do it in a way that does not harm the environment. Going on an African safari is hugely rewarding, he says, but looking at animals from inside a Land-Rover is a bit like sitting in a goldfish bowl; your feet literally never touch the ground, and after a few days you can feel strangely detached from the real Africa and its people. Serena Active, Du Plessis's new arm of the Serena hotels and lodges group, aims to connect the safari-goer with the landscape and culture. He leads fascinating walks through Mto wa Mbu, describing the crops and meeting and talking to the locals who greet him with undisguised pleasure. These are not Disneyesque 'cultural experiences': no one tries to sell trinkets or entice you into their rudimentary shops; this is a real opportunity to learn about an almost medieval way of life. We were welcomed by Bibi, an 80-year-old woman who showed us her home; an earth-floored, mud-walled, banana leaf-thatched hut, which she shared with her daughters and numerous grandchildren; children who would benefit directly from the walk we were taking that morning. Some of the profits from the \u00a328-a-head charge go directly to the village. So far Jean has spent about \u00a3250 building a kindergarten out of local timber with a \u00a3350 concrete toilet block. Eighty children are taught in three sessions every day by a dedicated teacher part-funded by the walking project. A few days later we sped down the Rift Valley escarpment on a 10-mile mountain bike ride that took us through the village again. Children ran out to greet us and stare at these strange creatures in helmets and backpacks. It was election day and the kindergarten, just like any school in Britain, had been turned into a polling station; a patient, humbling queue forming outside. We rode out to the Masai tribesmen's land on the banks of the lake where young children drove cattle herds 300-strong on to fresh pasture and maribou storks and brilliantly-coloured bee-eaters wheeled overhead in the warm air. The day before we had hiked for three hours with Du Plessis's partner, Megan Craft, amid the stunning scenery surrounding the Ngorongoro crater, a 100-square-mile caldera, formed nearly three million years ago. We walked away from the crater and up the slopes of Mt Oldeani, passing cattle and goats kicking up clouds of red dust on their way down to drink. We encountered Masai tribesmen, visible for miles in their bright red tunics and armed only with spear and staff. This is a national park and home to all the wild animals of Africa; lion, cheetah, leopard, elephant, buffalo, rhino. While the area we walked was deemed to be away from their normal habitats, each hike is accompanied by an armed park ranger - just in case - but the fearless Masai put their trust in their mystic red and their spears. We had spent the previous day and that morning in a Land-Rover, touring the crater, marvelling at the huge variety of wildlife, and were ready to stretch our legs. Leading the trek was Tim Mdinka, one of the seven staff employed by Serena Active who act as guides on walks and bike rides, bringing their local knowledge to bear when describing the dramatic landscape, the animals , the plants and the trees. Tim told us about life in Tanzania; how education is compulsory from seven to 14 , but how few go on after that; how families are still having eight to 10 children each; how the Masai honour their cattle (the larger the herd, the higher the status of the herdsman). He stooped down and picked some objects off the ground. 'Here, have these,' he said, handing them to my younger son Nicholas, 'they're zebra teeth.' A little later he stooped again and picked up something bright; a carefully worked tool, like an arrow head. 'Something from a witchdoctor, I think,' he said and added it to Nicholas's collection. Over the final ridge we watched the sun set over Lake Eyasi, a lovely sight made even lovelier by a glass of champagne supplied from a Land-Rover waiting to drive us back through the dark to the Ngorongoro Serena lodge. Far below us on the banks of the lake live the 500 members of the Hutza tribe - hunter-gatherers who wear animal skins and eat baboons. No government has yet been able to persuade them to send their children to school. To help elect a new government, Tim joined us the next day for a lift back to Manyara. He had to vote in his home district, so chose to give up a day and a night to go to the polls; a country that has been independent for only 40 years values democracy rather higher than we do in this country.

NHS managers and health ministers are usually quietly pleased. Everyone can start sending their shopping lists to No 10. Managers and doctors want new wings, operating theatres, intensive care beds. Unions demand more staff and better pay - happily just before pay negotiations reach conclusion. Ministers push themselves to the front of the extra funding queue at the Treasury. Education, police, roads and trident submarines get pushed back again. I am not seeking to diminish the difficulties the NHS faces during the winter, nor the unacceptable and traumatic experiences of some patients. Staff shortages, lack of intensive care beds and crowded A&amp;Es are near year-round issues which get highlighted at Christmas. Creating the NHS plan is the first serious recognition that the system was failing, not winter. Funding the plan is the first serious attempt to put it right.",

Around the World in 80 Years may be his swansong but it throws a new reflective light on his work, for this is a collection of Newby's photographs, many previously unpublished, adorned only by a nostalgic introductory essay and some anecdotal captions. </p> <p>There is a wonderful scrapbook set at the front with pictures of Newby, his wife Wanda - his constant travelling companion - and their family and friends. 'My life has been an exercise in erratic navigation,' writes Newby and it is the charming but direct Wanda who has kept him steady as he panics when his luggage goes out of sight or chaos looms. She is pictured sleeping blissfully on the Trans-Siberian railway in a compartment 'reduced to a shambles' by her husband. </p> <p>The excitement of Newby's writing comes from his self-deprecatory humour, his intense curiosity about people as well as places and an enthusiasm for the uncharted path. It was this raw energy that fired his writing. These pictures, beautifully presented with a warm sepia-edged glow, provide another perspective. They show a gentle stylish side to Newby. He is an outstanding photographer who combines an ability to capture the significant moment with some creative composition. </p> <p>Some of the landscapes are beguiling. The river Tay winds timelessly through Perthshire framed by a ruined tower on a cliffside at Kinnoull Hill; vines on the Veneto appear to be on a winter march and a silhouetted boy brings perspective to a primeval water landscape in Bali. </p> <p>As in Newby's writing, the book catches a specific moment in the lives of the people he meets. A serene elderly woman looks out from her window in Rouseau, Dominica; a lorryload of Turkish guestworkers beam for the camera on their return home from Germany; and Signor Ugolotti, the Apennine farmer who hid Newby behind enemy lines during the war, puffs proudly on his pipe. </p> <p>We'll miss not having New adventures to follow but this self-confessed worrier need have no fears that his loyal army of readers will be enchanted by his final collection.</p>",

If indeed it was a sub-tropical paradise, then we had obviously arrived during the rainy season. 'Ireland' and 'rain' may well be two words that feel lonely if they don't appear in the same sentence, but even the locals were amazed by the five days of continuous driving rain we brought with us.

For this he was knighted (he was known as the Knight of the Knife) and a law was passed saying that Irish octogenarians could kill in self-defence.

      "body": "<p>Evidence of Dorothy L Sayers's obsessive relationship with her detective hero, Lord Peter Wimsey, comes to light this week in a collection of previously unseen letters and notebooks. The writer, who was fiercely protective of her suave and well-bred sleuth, appears at times to have believed he really existed.</p> <p>She drew up a full fictional family tree for Lord Peter and violently objected to attempts to portray him on stage or screen. The documents are expected to fetch up to \u00a3360,000 at auction next month and form the largest collection in private hands. Although Sotheby's has kept the identity of the owner a secret, she is known to be Fortuna Fleming, second wife of Sayers's son, Anthony.</p> <p>'She has obviously decided to sell the family letters at last,' said Barbara Reynolds, the author's biographer and friend.</p> <p>Sayers was not married, and her son grew up with a favourite cousin, Ivy Shrimpton. Much to Sayers's pride, Anthony won a scholarship to Balliol College - the same Oxford college Sayers had chosen for Wimsey.</p> <p>The new documents have intrigued the writer Jill Paton Walsh, who published her own solution to Sayers's unfinished Wimsey mystery, Thrones, Dominions, in 1998. The manuscript had been abandoned by Sayers in 1936 and was rediscovered 60 years later in a safe at her literary agency. 'If some of the notes refer to Sayers's own plans for the ending of Thrones,' said Paton Walsh, 'then I am keen to see them.'</p> <p>The sale at Sotheby's in London on 19 December will attract worldwide interest. A representative from Wheaton College, Illinois, where most of Sayers's manuscripts have been kept since the 1970s, is coming to London for the auction, but will have to bid against private devotees of Wimsey and his faithful manservant, Bunter. Included with the sale lot of papers, books, letters and contracts are rare, signed first editions, handwritten and typed manuscripts for novels and plays, the author's files on real-life crimes and more than 2,000 volumes from her library.</p> <p>Up to \u00a335,000 is expected for almost 300 of Sayers's original publishing contracts, royalty statements and bank records, while two typescripts for the Lord Peter Wimsey play, Busman's Honeymoon, could fetch \u00a315,000. 'This is perhaps the most interesting find of all,' said Paton Walsh, who believes Sayers fell deeply under the spell of Wimsey. 'I would say she was more than a little in love with him.'</p> <p>Sayers introduced Wimsey in Whose Body? in 1928. Her newly disclosed response to a request from the actor Peter Haddon, who wanted to play Wimsey in a film, betrays the strength of her feelings. 'I do not like the films and I do not want them,' she writes. 'There could not be a worse moment than this for letting film-minded people tamper with Peter. I will see the whole bunch of fools and liars at Elstree and Ealing in hell first.'</p> <p>Sayers invented a genealogy of Wimsey's family which included spoof letters and documents relating to ancestors dating back three centuries. A thick file of papers relating to 'The Wimsey Family' is estimated to fetch up to \u00a39,000.</p> <p>Also under the hammer will be hundreds of letters sent to Sayers and copies of her typed replies, mostly dating from the late 1930s until her death in 1957, a period when the writer, who liked to wear men's suits complete with tie and cufflinks, was one of Britain's most celebrated public figures. One of the earliest letters, dated 1910, was sent by the Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton to thank Sayers for a sonnet she wrote about him.</p> <p>Dorothy Leigh Sayers was born in Oxford in 1893 and educated in Salisbury and at Somerville College, Oxford. After teaching in Hull, she became an advertising copy-writer and helped create the famous Toucan Guinness adverts. After the success of the first Wimsey book he appeared in eight further stories, among them Clouds of Witness (1926), The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club (1928), The Five Red Herrings (1931) and Strong Poison (1930).</p> <p>Peter Selley, a books and manuscripts specialist at the auction house, said: 'Sayers was unquestionably one of the greatest detective writers of the twentieth century and this archive contains much autograph and typescript material not preserved in any other form. It covers the author's entire literary and professional life from her earliest juvenilia to her final lectures, articles, and her work during World War Two which included broadcasting on religious subjects for BBC Radio.'</p> <p>Christopher Dean, chairman of the Dorothy L Sayers Society, said: 'Our concern is that, as far as possible, the items of extreme value to scholars are kept together. The personal letters are of tremendous significance, as are the papers relating to her scholastic life in areas other than detective fiction, such as her translation of Dante's Inferno and her Christian writings. It is all of great importance.'</p>",

She drew up a full fictional family tree for Lord Peter and violently objected to attempts to portray him on stage or screen. The documents are expected to fetch up to \u00a3360,000 at auction next month and form the largest collection in private hands. Although Sotheby's has kept the identity of the owner a secret, she is known to be Fortuna Fleming, second wife of Sayers's son, Anthony. 'She has obviously decided to sell the family letters at last,' said Barbara Reynolds, the author's biographer and friend. Sayers was not married, and her son grew up with a favourite cousin, Ivy Shrimpton. Much to Sayers's pride, Anthony won a scholarship to Balliol College - the same Oxford college Sayers had chosen for Wimsey. The new documents have intrigued the writer Jill Paton Walsh, who published her own solution to Sayers's unfinished Wimsey mystery, Thrones, Dominions, in 1998. The manuscript had been abandoned by Sayers in 1936 and was rediscovered 60 years later in a safe at her literary agency. 'If some of the notes refer to Sayers's own plans for the ending of Thrones,' said Paton Walsh, 'then I am keen to see them.' The sale at Sotheby's in London on 19 December will attract worldwide interest. A representative from Wheaton College, Illinois, where most of Sayers's manuscripts have been kept since the 1970s, is coming to London for the auction, but will have to bid against private devotees of Wimsey and his faithful manservant, Bunter. Included with the sale lot of papers, books, letters and contracts are rare, signed first editions, handwritten and typed manuscripts for novels and plays, the author's files on real-life crimes and more than 2,000 volumes from her library. Up to \u00a335,000 is expected for almost 300 of Sayers's original publishing contracts, royalty statements and bank records, while two typescripts for the Lord Peter Wimsey play, Busman's Honeymoon, could fetch \u00a315,000. 'This is perhaps the most interesting find of all,' said Paton Walsh, who believes Sayers fell deeply under the spell of Wimsey. 'I would say she was more than a little in love with him.' Sayers introduced Wimsey in Whose Body? in 1928. Her newly disclosed response to a request from the actor Peter Haddon, who wanted to play Wimsey in a film, betrays the strength of her feelings. 'I do not like the films and I do not want them,' she writes. 'There could not be a worse moment than this for letting film-minded people tamper with Peter. I will see the whole bunch of fools and liars at Elstree and Ealing in hell first.' Sayers invented a genealogy of Wimsey's family which included spoof letters and documents relating to ancestors dating back three centuries. A thick file of papers relating to 'The Wimsey Family' is estimated to fetch up to \u00a39,000. Also under the hammer will be hundreds of letters sent to Sayers and copies of her typed replies, mostly dating from the late 1930s until her death in 1957, a period when the writer, who liked to wear men's suits complete with tie and cufflinks, was one of Britain's most celebrated public figures. One of the earliest letters, dated 1910, was sent by the Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton to thank Sayers for a sonnet she wrote about him. Dorothy Leigh Sayers was born in Oxford in 1893 and educated in Salisbury and at Somerville College, Oxford. After teaching in Hull, she became an advertising copy-writer and helped create the famous Toucan Guinness adverts. After the success of the first Wimsey book he appeared in eight further stories, among them Clouds of Witness (1926), The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club (1928), The Five Red Herrings (1931) and Strong Poison (1930). Peter Selley, a books and manuscripts specialist at the auction house, said: 'Sayers was unquestionably one of the greatest detective writers of the twentieth century and this archive contains much autograph and typescript material not preserved in any other form. It covers the author's entire literary and professional life from her earliest juvenilia to her final lectures, articles, and her work during World War Two which included broadcasting on religious subjects for BBC Radio.' Christopher Dean, chairman of the Dorothy L Sayers Society, said: 'Our concern is that, as far as possible, the items of extreme value to scholars are kept together. The personal letters are of tremendous significance, as are the papers relating to her scholastic life in areas other than detective fiction, such as her translation of Dante's Inferno and her Christian writings. It is all of great importance.'",

A year earlier the Hindujas had agreed to pump funds into the Faith Zone at the Dome.</p> <p>Senior sources at India's Central Bureau of Investigation, the Indian equivalent of the FBI, believe it is 'very likely' that an Indian court will charge the Hinduja brothers with taking illegal commission as part of a controversial arms deal in 1986. If that happens, Indian prosecutors have confirmed they will move swiftly to extradite the Hindujas, the leading members of Britain's wealthiest Asian family, possibly ignitting a political scandal.</p> <p>Such a turn of events would be highly embarrasing for Blair as the Hindujas have built up close links with New Labour.</p> <p>The Hindujas have insisted they volunteered to help fund the Dome and that no Minister 'solicited' them for money. But the brothers visited Peter Mandelson in October 1998 when he was trade secretary and in charge of the Dome.</p> <p>Mandelson claimed the meeting was about 'Indo-British relations', although he has admitted the Dome was referred to at the end.</p> <p>Mandelson is also known to have met the Hindujas several times when he was Minister without portfolio and one source recalls a dinner Blair and Mandelson had at Hinduja's central London home before the election.</p> <p>Norman Baker, Liberal Democrat spokesman on the Dome, said: 'It certainly seems eyebrow-raising that somebody who the Tories had turned down for a British passport should be given one so quickly by Labour. Questions have to be asked if was given as a thank you for trying to bail out the Dome.'</p> <p>Four days after Srichand Hinduja became a British citizen, the Hindujas funded a reception at their London offices in honour of Lord Chancellor Lord Irvine and Leicester MP Keith Vaz, who had become Britain's first Asian minister. Mandelson and trade secretary Stephen Byers were also present.</p> <p>Vaz is one of the Hindujas' closest political associates. As a backbench MP, he regularly visited their headquarters in London and attends many of their functions. When shadow trade and industry spokesman Christopher Chope asked parliamentary question on the Hindujas last year, he received a call from Vaz asking what he was up to.</p> <p>However, despite such close relations with New Labour, recent events suggest Downing Street is trying to distance the Blairs from the Hindujas.</p> <p>The Prime Minister was invited to the Hindujas' Diwali party, celebrating Indian new year, last month, but declined. A year earlier, the Prime Minister and his wife were star guests at the Hindujas' extravagant Diwali party in North London. Photos of Cherie dressed in a traditional Indian outfit were published around the world.</p> <p>At the time the Hindujas and Downing Street were happy for the press to think the \u00a31,000 silk embroidered kamize which Cherie wore was a gift from the Hindujas.</p> <p>However, last week Cherie Blair's press secretary denied the Prime Minister's wife had taken a gift from the Hindujas.

      "bodyText": "An Indian billionaire facing extradition from Britain was courted by Tony Blair's government and given citizenship here after his family donated \u00a31m to help bail out the Millennium Dome, The Observer can reveal. Srichand Hinduja, who will learn tomorrow whether he and two of his brothers will face trial in India over claims that they took \u00a37m in kickbacks from Indian arms deals, was turned down for British citizenship by the Conservatives in 1990. Home secretary Jack Straw approved Srichand Hinduja's application for a British passport last September, despite the fact that he and his family were at the centre of investigations by Indian police into one of the country's biggest corruption scandals. A year earlier the Hindujas had agreed to pump funds into the Faith Zone at the Dome. Senior sources at India's Central Bureau of Investigation, the Indian equivalent of the FBI, believe it is 'very likely' that an Indian court will charge the Hinduja brothers with taking illegal commission as part of a controversial arms deal in 1986. If that happens, Indian prosecutors have confirmed they will move swiftly to extradite the Hindujas, the leading members of Britain's wealthiest Asian family, possibly ignitting a political scandal. Such a turn of events would be highly embarrasing for Blair as the Hindujas have built up close links with New Labour. The Hindujas have insisted they volunteered to help fund the Dome and that no Minister 'solicited' them for money. But the brothers visited Peter Mandelson in October 1998 when he was trade secretary and in charge of the Dome. Mandelson claimed the meeting was about 'Indo-British relations', although he has admitted the Dome was referred to at the end. Mandelson is also known to have met the Hindujas several times when he was Minister without portfolio and one source recalls a dinner Blair and Mandelson had at Hinduja's central London home before the election. Norman Baker, Liberal Democrat spokesman on the Dome, said: 'It certainly seems eyebrow-raising that somebody who the Tories had turned down for a British passport should be given one so quickly by Labour. Questions have to be asked if was given as a thank you for trying to bail out the Dome.' Four days after Srichand Hinduja became a British citizen, the Hindujas funded a reception at their London offices in honour of Lord Chancellor Lord Irvine and Leicester MP Keith Vaz, who had become Britain's first Asian minister. Mandelson and trade secretary Stephen Byers were also present. Vaz is one of the Hindujas' closest political associates. As a backbench MP, he regularly visited their headquarters in London and attends many of their functions. When shadow trade and industry spokesman Christopher Chope asked parliamentary question on the Hindujas last year, he received a call from Vaz asking what he was up to. However, despite such close relations with New Labour, recent events suggest Downing Street is trying to distance the Blairs from the Hindujas. The Prime Minister was invited to the Hindujas' Diwali party, celebrating Indian new year, last month, but declined. A year earlier, the Prime Minister and his wife were star guests at the Hindujas' extravagant Diwali party in North London. Photos of Cherie dressed in a traditional Indian outfit were published around the world. At the time the Hindujas and Downing Street were happy for the press to think the \u00a31,000 silk embroidered kamize which Cherie wore was a gift from the Hindujas. However, last week Cherie Blair's press secretary denied the Prime Minister's wife had taken a gift from the Hindujas. 'They got it wrong,' said Fiona Millar. 'They offered her an outfit. But she didn't want it and it went to charity.' Moves to distance the government from the Hindujas follow an investigation into a controversial \u00a3211m arms contract between the Indian government and Swedish defence company Bofors in 1986. Last month, India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a charge-sheet setting out their claims against the Hindujas and accusing them of taking part in a 'criminal conspiracy'. The main allegation is that the three brothers - Gopichand, Srichand and Swiss-based Prakash - used their influence with the late Indian prime minister Rajiv Ghandi to secure a contract for how itzers with the Swedish firm and illegally took more than \u00a37m in commission. After a long battle with the Hindujas, the CBI finally got access to details of their Swiss bank accounts, which showed that Bofors paid more than \u00a37m into secret accounts owned by McIntyre Corporation - a Hinduja front company based in Panama. The Hindujas denied any wrongdoing, claiming they are the victims of a political vendetta. A spokesman said: 'The brothers have consistently co-operated in all respects with the authorities in both Switzerland and India and will continue to do so in the future.' antony.barnett@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>I have never enjoyed shopping for my supper more so than in the last few weeks. The air is crisp. The market stalls are groaning with fat roots, purple cabbage and wacky mushrooms. The new apples spurt with juice and the Conference pears are still hard enough to hurt your gums. There are pomegranates, quinces and fat figs. Partridge is there, too, with plump, wet scallops and diminutive beetroots complete with their bloodshot plume of leaves. And someone, somewhere, is roasting chestnuts. </p> <p>Fish, be it mackerel, mussels, lobster or crab, is now at its autumn peak. The piscatorially minded are spoilt for choice, and there seems no reason to do anything more than fling your fillet on the grill and offer it up with wedges of fat lemon or bake it with a drizzle of oil and some salt. Last week I roasted tiny cubes of aubergine, salted to stop them soaking up too much oil, then laid my mackerels, whole and unboned, on the side. Olive oil, a pinch of ground cinnamon and a couple of sprigs of thyme went in there too: a robust Mediterranean-scented supper for a wet Wednesday night. </p> <p>We must cook rather than graze if we are to survive the cold and the wet. Those allergic to cooking may need to bite the bullet and get the casserole down from its shelf if they are not to short-change the family dinner table. No supermarket dinner-in-a-dish will hit the spot now. Only onions, starch and meat juices can get through to our marrow when everyone comes home soaked through to the skin. Herbivores might like to try boiling onions in their jackets then lifting them into a roasting dish with butter, salt and black pepper, letting them bake sweetly till their flesh is as soft as silk. </p> <p>Game figures high on any omnivore's autumn shopping list. How you cook your partridge, pheasant or mallard will depend on what else looks good when you get to the shops, but apples could figure in there somewhere. Try throwing some peeled and chopped Worcesters or Cox into the roasting pan, then crushing them to sweeten the pan juices. A potato masher will do nicely. A tart sauce made by simmering a couple of peeled Bramleys, Grenadiers or lesser-known George Caves with a very little water can be whisked to a smooth slop, and is for me a happier accompaniment than most for a roast wild duck. Both sauce and bird will take about half an hour. </p> <p>Whether it flies or waddles, duck seems right for this pre-Christmas season. The inevitable march of the turkey will soon be upon us. The Chinese way with star anise or five-spice powder is warming enough. Some days I use oyster sauce with it instead. Those who cannot face roasting a whole bird - too much fug and grease, if you ask me - might like to have a go at a leg or two instead. I cook mine this way: slowly saut\u00e9 the duck legs in a covered casserole with a little oil and salt, then cut the meat from the bone and set it aside. Shred half a red cabbage, then fry in the same pan but with a clove or two of crushed garlic and over a higher heat till its colours shine like pickled cabbage. Shake in a little oyster sauce, a little dark soy, then add the shredded duck. </p> <p>Late autumn, with the air on the slide from cool to cold, was the time many families used to kill their pig. The offal, which could not be cured or dried or made into a fat-covered confit for keeping, would be the apr\u00e8s-slaughter feast. The blood that was saved was made into black pudding. How convenient then that it should go so well with apples, the fruit of the moment. I fry finger-thick slices of Bury black pud, and thinner ones of apple, in butter, then drizzle them with an impromptu sauce made from the buttery juices left in the pan thickened with cream and a spoonful of mustard. </p> <p>I took my fill of home-grown tomatoes and green beans this year and, now they are gone, I have taken to the season's kale, chard and cabbage more than ever. The high spot has been the January King cabbages that have been around for the last couple of weeks. These are true winter brassicas, their leaves crisp and frilly, their flavour as deep and earthy. Steamed, shaken dry and tossed with salted butter or hot bacon fat, it is as fine as any other veg. The trick is simply not just to slightly undercook it, but to serve those heavily veined green and mauve leaves as hot as you can get them. </p> <p>We shouldn't ignore the chubby white roots of celeriac. The time-honoured treatment is to grate the woody lump and stir it into a mustard mayonnaise to make celeriac remoulade, but with a bit of tweaking you can eat it hot, too. I give it much the same treatment, just changing the mayonnaise for cr\u00e8me frache and adding a shake from the wine vinegar bottle. The mustard is what makes it, but don't go overboard - you don't want to cancel out this root's deep mineral flavour. </p> <p>We are approaching the polenta season. You can, of course, eat this substantial golden maize paste at any time of the year, but we only really need it, like porridge, when the wet sets in. Good as it is with thick gravies, I like mine with a slice of blue cheese melted into it. Try a collapsing Gorgonzola, or for a milder taste, the stripy hybrid that includes layers of that and mascarpone. </p> <p>With my weekly purchase of Comice pears edging their way toward perfection on my kitchen windowsill it seems right and fitting to get the most suitable cheese to go with them. With their cold flesh as soft and clear as a fruit sorbet, you could take a salty or nutty cheese - either will work. Nuggets of old, craggy Parmigiano Reggiano fit like a dream with a ripe pear, but so too do the milder English varieties such as the floral, buttery Mrs Kirkham's Lancashire. My cheese of the month has to be the Ticklemore I have been picking up from Neal's Yard's shop in the endangered Borough Market. Its crust the beige and white of a field mushroom, this is a nutty, firm-fleshed goat's cheese whose milk-and-green-hazelnut flavour seems more pronounced than I have ever known it. </p> <p>The chestnuts that are cooked over coals in the street rarely live up to the promise of their nutty, charcoal aroma. At home, they are worth taking trouble with, by which I mean soaking them in boiling water, peeling and scrupulously de-fuzzing them. It takes an age, but the vacuum packed and tinned varieties all taste muddy to me and have none of the rich nuttiness of the fresh. (The delectable and hideously expensive marron glac\u00e9 are a different matter altogether.) I roast my peeled nuts in a dry frying pan, letting them colour deeply before salting them gingerly and offering them warm, with pre-dinner drinks. The wonderful thing is that everyone thinks you have gone to so much trouble. The truth is that you have. </p> <p>While I shall miss those autumn raspberries, the first zest of a peeled clementine - a teasing whiff of Christmas if ever there was one - will suffice for a while. Better still is the honey-and-rose scent of a bowl of quinces. The English ones, such as pear-shaped Meech's Prolific, are worth tracking down for poaching in muscat wine and vanilla. Quince-tree owners seem blessed with the generosity gene. Make friends with one before the frosts bring the deep golden fruits off their branches. </p> <p>I would be failing my duty if I omitted to remind you of the Italia grapes in the shops now. They have the sweetness and flavour of Beaumes de Venise and should, I think, be served very cold, so they burst juicily in the mouth. I have taken to eating them after supper with the new walnuts, which if you catch them young, are pale and supple. Don't eat the grapes too soon. They are worth keeping until they reach an almost transparent golden-green, when their sweetness will be at its most noticeably honeyed. </p> <p>The Turkish figs - plump, purple and tender as a bruise - make up for the autumn's lack of peaches and apricots. What they miss in flavour they make up for in sheer sensuality. Unless you are going to bake them, they must be wantonly ripe. Look for a bead or two of nectar around the base.

      "bodyText": "I have never enjoyed shopping for my supper more so than in the last few weeks. The air is crisp. The market stalls are groaning with fat roots, purple cabbage and wacky mushrooms. The new apples spurt with juice and the Conference pears are still hard enough to hurt your gums. There are pomegranates, quinces and fat figs. Partridge is there, too, with plump, wet scallops and diminutive beetroots complete with their bloodshot plume of leaves. And someone, somewhere, is roasting chestnuts. Fish, be it mackerel, mussels, lobster or crab, is now at its autumn peak. The piscatorially minded are spoilt for choice, and there seems no reason to do anything more than fling your fillet on the grill and offer it up with wedges of fat lemon or bake it with a drizzle of oil and some salt. Last week I roasted tiny cubes of aubergine, salted to stop them soaking up too much oil, then laid my mackerels, whole and unboned, on the side. Olive oil, a pinch of ground cinnamon and a couple of sprigs of thyme went in there too: a robust Mediterranean-scented supper for a wet Wednesday night. We must cook rather than graze if we are to survive the cold and the wet. Those allergic to cooking may need to bite the bullet and get the casserole down from its shelf if they are not to short-change the family dinner table. No supermarket dinner-in-a-dish will hit the spot now. Only onions, starch and meat juices can get through to our marrow when everyone comes home soaked through to the skin. Herbivores might like to try boiling onions in their jackets then lifting them into a roasting dish with butter, salt and black pepper, letting them bake sweetly till their flesh is as soft as silk. Game figures high on any omnivore's autumn shopping list. How you cook your partridge, pheasant or mallard will depend on what else looks good when you get to the shops, but apples could figure in there somewhere. Try throwing some peeled and chopped Worcesters or Cox into the roasting pan, then crushing them to sweeten the pan juices. A potato masher will do nicely. A tart sauce made by simmering a couple of peeled Bramleys, Grenadiers or lesser-known George Caves with a very little water can be whisked to a smooth slop, and is for me a happier accompaniment than most for a roast wild duck. Both sauce and bird will take about half an hour. Whether it flies or waddles, duck seems right for this pre-Christmas season. The inevitable march of the turkey will soon be upon us. The Chinese way with star anise or five-spice powder is warming enough. Some days I use oyster sauce with it instead. Those who cannot face roasting a whole bird - too much fug and grease, if you ask me - might like to have a go at a leg or two instead. I cook mine this way: slowly saut\u00e9 the duck legs in a covered casserole with a little oil and salt, then cut the meat from the bone and set it aside.

      "body": "<p>Three years ago I wrote a piece on viburnums. I got a long and angry letter from an older reader berating me for using an unacknowledged quote from Hillier's Guide to Trees and Shrubs . Quite right, too - although perhaps not quite the proof positive that, as he suggested, I was a charlatan unworthy of 'this once-great paper's pages'. But ever since then I have always tried to acknowledge descriptions that were not my own and also to limit myself to writing about what I know. And I know so little. And I have so many books. And I read so much. And - this is the real issue - my own garden here in Herefordshire is deliberately and inevitably very limited to what we like and to what will grow happily in our wet climate and heavy clay loam. </p> <p>I have a problem with winter-flowering shrubs. I don't mean the early-spring-flowering ones such as the daphne, witch hazel, forsythia or winter-flowering jasmine. I like them as much as for their being harbingers of spring as for their flowers. Nor do I mean the latecomers, such as the few roses that will flower on to Christmas, especially when helped along by global warming. But this no-season's land between Bonfire Night and Christmas, or not-autumn and not-quite-winter, is a season of coloured leaves, coloured barks and berries. Leaves are valued mainly in their passing. If they stayed half-alive and half-dead for more than a few weeks, we would soon be tired of them. Likewise berries, which are so shinily un-flowerlike that they are another completely new instrument playing the old tune. And bark is perfect for winter. The more coloured stems we have in this garden the more I want. It suits the season. </p> <p>Each of these things is lovely on its own and well orchestrated, and they can enrich a poverty-stricken time. But no plant, at this stripped-out time of year, provides flowers in scale, form or colour that warrants space in the garden. I can look them all up, know a fair bit about them and can collate all that knowledge for you, but it does not really convince me. There is something about a lone-flowering shrub on a wet winter's day that seems rather futile. However lovely the plant, it often fails to do enough. The lesson is not to ditch them but to think carefully about their positioning. They are not at their best in a border that is geared for summer display. </p> <p>Nevertheless it would be less-than-optimistically human to abandon the precious few flowers that we do get in midwinter just because they don't quite work in the garden. I realise that for most people they have a powerful magic. The few times I have seen really effective use of winter shrubs, they have been tucked into a corner or in the lee of a wall or by a door or window. They need to be used as a vignette, not a statement, because there is too much sky and, with a few exceptions, the statement is lost in the wind, rain and muddy grey of a winter's afternoon. Keep it cosy. </p> <p>The viburnums are the biggest and best-known group for this. I had dinner with a garden-designer friend the other day who told me that when he started out and was asked the name of a shrub that he did not know - and one of the surest rules of life is never trust anyone who can instantly name every plant in any garden - he would reply, 'Viburnum.' It worked every time. The reason for this is that it is such a large and diverse family, ranging from the most familiar of the lot, Viburnum x bodnantense 'Dawn' with its floret bubbles of tiny flowers on bare branches that can start appearing now and last right through to March, to the evergreen V tinus 'Laurestinus' or the spring- flowering Viburnum plicatum ' Mariesii' that looks like an exceptionally lovely hydrangea. Viburnum farreri has a good fragrance and is best outside against a warm wall that will trap its scent. The species flowers are white, tinged with pink, whereas V farreri 'Candidissimum' is pure white. V tinus has no scent but the distinction of black berries, while V x bodnantense 'Dawn' smells, according to my letter writer (telling me a little more than I wanted to know) like cat's pee. It doesn't. </p> <p>I have been trying to think of ways to make these shrubs work, to improve them, and it cannot be done. The truth is that I think these are dull plants and belong to dull gardening. In the summer they are hopeless and in winter, for the most part, their flowers are a token, rather like the Christmas present that you do not want. You appreciate the thought but_ They stem from a lazy view of garden-as-chore, which breeds the notion that a 'good' plant is one that covers most space with least work. Think of all the gardens with a strip of token border around the edge and lax shrubs planted too close to the fence dotted without rhyme or reason along it. Either that or think of the approach to an M4 corridor corporate headquarters. Better to fill the body of the garden with shrubs as understorey to a few standard trees - which is what most of them want to do. </p> <p>I do have a soft spot for wintersweet, Chimonanthus praecox. Like many winter-flowering shrubs, it isn't much of a looker, but the little primrose-yellow blooms are fabulously fragrant and make very good cut flowers. The scent stays much longer if kept in a cold room. It can be trained to make a climber on a sheltered, sunny wall and, in many ways, is best grown like this, with a clematis using it for support in the summer. </p> <p>I like mahonias, although I wouldn't go so far as to plant one in my own garden - no place that feels right for them. I like the way the evergreen leaves and bright-yellow flowers combine a faintly exotic, jungly feel with daffodil freshness. An unlikely mix, but it does seem to work. Mahonia x media is perhaps the best known, with the clones 'Charity' and 'Lionel Fortescue' very available. All mahonias smell good, but M japonica is perhaps the most fragrant of all. The Asian mahonias like shaded sites and will tolerate a wetter soil than the American mahonias. They are particularly suitable for a thin soil over chalk. </p> <p>Although I have been dismissive of these scant winter-flowering shrubs, I do grow a couple of varieties of winter-flowering honeysuckle, Lonicera fragrantissima and L purpursii and the evergreen version, L standishii. I somehow acquired them years ago and, tucked away almost entirely out of sight on a north-facing wall, they provide the best-scented of all winter flowers. It is rare for them to flower this early, but there are usually a few tentative tiny flowers by Christmas, and they hit their full stride by the middle of January.</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>Did I say that we got through the floods unscathed? I spoke too soon. Between writing last week's words and these, the water has lapped at our door and laps yet. To try to provide drainage, we have dug a trench right down the length of the garden and laid a perforated land drain. It was dug fast, by eye, and curves subtly. </p> <p>The floods rose again as this was being done and the trench promptly filled to the brim, without making any noticeable difference to the water levels in the garden. The trench was cut down a grass path, but the rain made the sides collapse overnight, so parts of Jewel garden borders had to be evacuated so this could be repaired. While the emergency digging went on, Poppy, our Jack Russell terrier, went on a manic vole-hunt, digging dozens of holes in the borders, spraying tulip bulbs at every pass and destroying the roots of scores of plants. Sort of funny, but also sort of the last straw.</p> <p>Although the canal/trench is a thing of sinuous beauty, there is a huge amount of soil thrown up from it. This is now completely saturated. An utterly sodden 70m mound of mud. The demarcation lines between grass, flood and mud are indecipherable runes ploughed into the ground.</p> <p>The truth is that if we knew then what we know now, we would have laid this garden out in a completely different way to accommodate the inevitable flooding. Over the past week, I have toyed with taking a JCB to the place and doing just this, but balk a little at that. If I inspect my motives honestly I have to confess that I feel I have not displayed what we have done enough. I want more TV crews, more public sharing in this place before I rip it apart. Vanity or altruism? Neither, really. Just a natural born show-off.</p> <p>Despite the waters rising, we have continued the process of cutting four new 2m brick squares into the Jewel garden. This means digging up hard paths, potting up plants, removing topsoil and putting in scalpings and sand before laying the bricks. It is worth the trouble tenfold and has dramatically improved the garden. This garden has always been very long on places to delve and hoe and short on sites to sit and consider, which means that the large beds now revolve around these small seating areas and we can go out and drink our champagne in one of five spots according to the light and state of performance of the plants. Dressed, of course, in waterproofs and waders.</p> <p><strong>Your roots: Golden rules for prudent pruning</strong></p> <p>I know that people can get into a muddle about pruning shrubs - as though there was anything to be muddled about. </p> <p>The first rule of all pruning is: when in doubt, don't. The second rule is always to cut back to something, be it a leaf, bud or branch. And the third is that winter pruning promotes vigorous spring regrowth . So resist the evidence of your eyes and cut the existing weak growth back hardest.</p> <p>Notice if the flowers are produced on the current year's fresh growth or on the previous year's. If the former, it is best to prune in early spring - as in the case of buddlejia - and if the latter, the time to do it is immediately after flowering - as with ribes.</p> <p>When you plant shrubs, prune any weak growth hard to encourage good strong shoots from the base of the plant next spring.</p> <p>If you are growing a shrub for its leaves, as I do with a cut-leaf golden elder, cut it back hard each spring and the new leaves will be both bigger and better coloured than they would be if it had been left unpruned.</p>",

The Asian mahonias like shaded sites and will tolerate a wetter soil than the American mahonias. They are particularly suitable for a thin soil over chalk. Although I have been dismissive of these scant winter-flowering shrubs, I do grow a couple of varieties of winter-flowering honeysuckle, Lonicera fragrantissima and L purpursii and the evergreen version, L standishii. I somehow acquired them years ago and, tucked away almost entirely out of sight on a north-facing wall, they provide the best-scented of all winter flowers. It is rare for them to flower this early, but there are usually a few tentative tiny flowers by Christmas, and they hit their full stride by the middle of January. My roots: A week in Monty's garden Did I say that we got through the floods unscathed? I spoke too soon. Between writing last week's words and these, the water has lapped at our door and laps yet. To try to provide drainage, we have dug a trench right down the length of the garden and laid a perforated land drain. It was dug fast, by eye, and curves subtly. The floods rose again as this was being done and the trench promptly filled to the brim, without making any noticeable difference to the water levels in the garden. The trench was cut down a grass path, but the rain made the sides collapse overnight, so parts of Jewel garden borders had to be evacuated so this could be repaired. While the emergency digging went on, Poppy, our Jack Russell terrier, went on a manic vole-hunt, digging dozens of holes in the borders, spraying tulip bulbs at every pass and destroying the roots of scores of plants. Sort of funny, but also sort of the last straw. Although the canal/trench is a thing of sinuous beauty, there is a huge amount of soil thrown up from it. This is now completely saturated. An utterly sodden 70m mound of mud. The demarcation lines between grass, flood and mud are indecipherable runes ploughed into the ground. The truth is that if we knew then what we know now, we would have laid this garden out in a completely different way to accommodate the inevitable flooding. Over the past week, I have toyed with taking a JCB to the place and doing just this, but balk a little at that. If I inspect my motives honestly I have to confess that I feel I have not displayed what we have done enough. I want more TV crews, more public sharing in this place before I rip it apart. Vanity or altruism? Neither, really. Just a natural born show-off. Despite the waters rising, we have continued the process of cutting four new 2m brick squares into the Jewel garden. This means digging up hard paths, potting up plants, removing topsoil and putting in scalpings and sand before laying the bricks. It is worth the trouble tenfold and has dramatically improved the garden. This garden has always been very long on places to delve and hoe and short on sites to sit and consider, which means that the large beds now revolve around these small seating areas and we can go out and drink our champagne in one of five spots according to the light and state of performance of the plants. Dressed, of course, in waterproofs and waders. Your roots: Golden rules for prudent pruning I know that people can get into a muddle about pruning shrubs - as though there was anything to be muddled about. The first rule of all pruning is: when in doubt, don't. The second rule is always to cut back to something, be it a leaf, bud or branch. And the third is that winter pruning promotes vigorous spring regrowth . So resist the evidence of your eyes and cut the existing weak growth back hardest. Notice if the flowers are produced on the current year's fresh growth or on the previous year's. If the former, it is best to prune in early spring - as in the case of buddlejia - and if the latter, the time to do it is immediately after flowering - as with ribes. When you plant shrubs, prune any weak growth hard to encourage good strong shoots from the base of the plant next spring. If you are growing a shrub for its leaves, as I do with a cut-leaf golden elder, cut it back hard each spring and the new leaves will be both bigger and better coloured than they would be if it had been left unpruned.",

It is clear that, despite her belief, this is not what the advertising industry thinks. Klein has just finished writing a report on women in advertising and has come up with some shocking findings. </p> <p>Despite the industry's great lurch towards gender equality over the last 10 years - the number of women in the sector now equals the men - one corner of the advertising world is still resolutely running a closed shop when it comes to bridging the gender divide. The creative arm of the advertising industry may have a reputation for radical thinking and challenging orthodoxy but it doesn't seem to be too keen on thinking out of the box on gender issues. The picture that emerges seems to have come straight from a centre spread in Loaded . </p> <p>Klein's report concluded that in the creative world of adland 'the stereotypical laddish atmosphere is still very much in existence'. Entering the creative world seems to make many women shudder. </p> <p>'It's like walking into a pub. It's quite daunting,' says Amanda Walsh, chief executive of Walsh, Trott, Chick, Smith. Numerous quotes in the report culled from interviews all across adland reinforce this view. 'It's a bit like walking into the lion's den,' says one female creative. Another says: 'Women find the atmosphere childish, petulant and myopic and they don't want to put up with that.' </p> <p>The suggestion is that the few women who do make it into the creative sector end up having to adopt a coping strategy. 'All successful women creatives have certain characteristics: they're powerful, feisty, hard as nails and can deal with men in a male way,' one creative director concluded. </p> <p>The report's findings are all the more surprising because the macho culture that seemed to stereotype the entire industry a few years ago now seems to have virtually disappeared in its other parts. The proportion of women who are directors of ad agencies has increased steadily over the past 10 years, up from 16 per cent in 1990 to 22 per cent now. </p> <p>In addition, the number of female account handlers has more than doubled - up from 27 per cent in 1986 to 54 per cent in 1999. More than half of those employed in planning and research are women. Women make up nearly half of all media teams. The statistics go on and on. </p> <p>But the creative side earns nil points . Only 17 per cent of copywriters are women - that's down from 20 per cent 10 years ago. Similarly, only 14 per cent of art directors are women - the lowest level ever, according to the report. Only two women in the top 20 agencies have the title 'creative director'. These statistics are not repeated elsewhere in the world. The UK creative advertising sector appears to be a supreme offender. </p> <p>'The report shows that in the last decade nothing has changed on the creative side of advertising,' Walsh says. </p> <p>But in reality it should have done. It's not as if the number of women wanting to break into advertising is diminishing. The pool of female talent exists. Women are in the majority on fine arts, design, media studies and communication courses - the spawning grounds for many creatives. But this doesn't translate into what is happening in the creative world of advertising. It seems to have become that most horrible, damaging, unacceptable concept in adland: the clich\u00e9. Rightly or wrongly it has earnt itself an image made up of laddish stereotypes which means that women are intimidated when applying for jobs in the creative sector. </p> <p>'When we're recruiting, over half the applicants are female. It means the creative directors, who are virtually universally male, must be giving out horrible vibes,' says Christine Walker, a partner at Walker Media. </p> <p>The report states: 'The laddish, yobbish end of the male creative fraternity gives it a real image problem for would-be creatives - the same way that the media used to have an image problem as full of Essex barrow boys.' Many female creatives reported what one referred to as 'rampant, laddish, sexist behaviour'. </p> <p>The bias against women may help partially explain why complaints about sexist advertising are on the increase. Last year the Advertising Standards Authority received 487 complaints related to sexist ads - a 12 per cent increase on 1997. </p> <p>But, argue many of the senior women in the ad industry, of more significance is what would happen to the creative product if there was greater female input. 'It would bring different ways of looking at things. After all, more than 70 per cent of expenditure is made by women. The balance between people who write the ads and those whom they should be aimed at is completely out of whack,' Klein says. Some argue this means many ads end miss the mark. </p> <p>'It's no coincidence that most of the famous advertising has been done for cars and beer. You won't find much for food and cosmetics. A lot of the great ads come about because people have a natural empathy with consumers. This is very difficult if you have a young male creative team which doesn't have much empathy. It's a heresy to say it because people within an agency get hugely insulted,' Walsh says. </p> <p>But considering that by 2002 more than half the working (and therefore spending) population will be female, ad agencies might start to wake up to the need for more balance in its creative divisions. 'If anybody believes DIY ads are aimed at men, they are mad. You don't need female creatives to work just on tampon ads. You need them for things like financial services, the lot,' Walker says. </p> <p>But the advertising industry has so far shown few signs that it believes this argument is a winner. Few women creatives think much will change in terms of the status quo, and the industry could end up missing out as a result. </p> <p>After all, the advent of new technology means that there is a raft of creative industries that weren't here five years ago.

'Those who have access to a computer system may abuse that system.' </p> <p>Mirror editor Piers Morgan was severely censured by the Press Complaints Commission in May for buying shares ahead of a tip in the paper. The Slickers, journalists Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell, were fired over their controversial dealings and are claiming unfair dismissal. </p> <p>The initial scandal surrounded Morgan's purchase in January of shares in Viglen, the renamed Amstrad computer-maker run by Tottenham Hotspur owner and Mirror columnist Sir Alan Sugar. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Sugar. The DTI's extended inquiry, however, is understood to have examined share dealings by a leading light at another London football club. </p> <p>Journalists and other staff at the Mirror have recently been formally interviewed by DTI inspectors in the inquiry, which is being conducted under the insider dealing provisions of Section 117 of the 1986 Financial Services Act. </p> <p>Last week, Morgan came under further pressure following the disclosure of emails that showed he had told Bhoyrul about his purchase of the Viglen shares. This appeared to contradict Morgan's story as published by the PCC in May. </p> <p>This weekend, however, the newspaper's owner, Trinity Mirror, denied that the PCC's published account formed part of its submission on Morgan's behalf to the press watchdog.

      "bodyText": "The Department of Trade and Industry has extended its inquiry into share dealings at the Mirror to cover alleged hacking into the newspaper's City share tips pages by certain of the newspaper group's staff. DTI inspectors are understood to be investigating dealings by scores of outsiders who bought shares plugged by the Mirror's disgraced Slickers tipsters before the articles appeared in print. The tips, sources say, are believed to have been passed on to friends and associates by certain staff who hacked into Slickers' articles in the paper's editorial system. 'There are more than just journalists involved,' one source close to the inquiry said. 'Those who have access to a computer system may abuse that system.' Mirror editor Piers Morgan was severely censured by the Press Complaints Commission in May for buying shares ahead of a tip in the paper. The Slickers, journalists Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell, were fired over their controversial dealings and are claiming unfair dismissal. The initial scandal surrounded Morgan's purchase in January of shares in Viglen, the renamed Amstrad computer-maker run by Tottenham Hotspur owner and Mirror columnist Sir Alan Sugar. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Sugar. The DTI's extended inquiry, however, is understood to have examined share dealings by a leading light at another London football club. Journalists and other staff at the Mirror have recently been formally interviewed by DTI inspectors in the inquiry, which is being conducted under the insider dealing provisions of Section 117 of the 1986 Financial Services Act. Last week, Morgan came under further pressure following the disclosure of emails that showed he had told Bhoyrul about his purchase of the Viglen shares. This appeared to contradict Morgan's story as published by the PCC in May. This weekend, however, the newspaper's owner, Trinity Mirror, denied that the PCC's published account formed part of its submission on Morgan's behalf to the press watchdog. The PCC also retracted the disputed words that 'he [Morgan] did not tell the City Slickers journalists of his Viglen purchase'. 'Trinity Mirror is correct,' PCC secretary Guy Black said. 'But our censure against Morgan was not based on the emails.' Trinity Mirror's own investigation cleared Morgan of any wrongdoing. The emails leaked last week were recovered by the firm from its computer servers during its review and passed to the DTI.

Last week, Narey felt compelled to explain to staff controlling a disproportionately large number of black inmates that they could not actually be Nazis and expect to enjoy a career in the Home Office. Membership of the British National Party would result in dismissal, he said. 'We have to own up that racism is a big problem for the prison service. This is one of a raft of measures needed to get it right.' </p> <p>A raft will be too small a vessel. Recent years have seen Alton Manning unlawfully killed in Blakenhurst jail and the Prison Service trying to stop an inquest's investigation into his murder or manslaughter. Meanwhile, a culture of 'sustained and promoted overtly racist behaviour' was revealed in Brixton prison. And, at the atrocious Feltham Young Offenders Institution, Zahid Mubarek was banged up with and murdered by Robert Stewart, a deranged bigot who had sent hundreds of letters from prison praising the killers of Stephen Lawrence and predicting the death of his luckless cell mate. </p> <p>There is a quick explanation for the violence - prison officers are attacked everywhere as white, working-class dinosaurs who frustrate the good intentions of their superiors...Yet what is striking about the toleration of the murders - and the suicides and the beatings - in the Prison Service is that the rot starts, and often stops, at the top; it breeds among well-bred politicians and senior civil servants who would be appalled if they were suspected of any bigotry in their private lives. </p> <p>The failed attempt to stop an inquest jury returning a true verdict of unlawful killing after it had heard how Alton Manning was dragged through a private jail by a posse of guards was planned at the highest levels of the Home Office. Mubarek's death was the result of the insouciance of its mandarins. In 1996, they gave themselves the easy target of providing racial and sexual awareness training to all employees by 2000. Result: 19 per cent of managers and 9 per cent of staff have been educated to date. In 1998, the service promised that inmates would not be forced to share a cell unless a rigorous risk-assessment had been completed. (Its incentive was the murder of Christopher Edwards. He was incarcerated with a psychopath who jumped on his face until his skull was so crushed dental records were needed to identify him.) Again, urgency descended into indolence. Paul Boateng, the Prisons Minister, admitted to the Commons this year that risk-assessments had yet to come to Feltham for all the bold commitments. If Whitehall had required officers to understand racism or judge dangers to inmates then Mubarek would not have been confined with Stewart, a man who sang the praises of the Ku Klux Klan. </p> <p>Boateng is the most senior black politician in British history and might be expected to care about such matters. But just as the first Labour Ministers in 1924 displayed a laughable deference to the monarchy and the first woman Prime Minister was, well, Margaret Thatcher, so the highest-flying black Minister is something of a disappointment all round. </p> <p>His career has followed a tired trajectory. He was an ultra-leftist on the Greater London Council in the Seventies who mellowed into a mainstream Kinnockite when the fashion changed. He is now a Third Way hard man, applauded by the Daily Mail for his harshness towards convicts, derision of social workers and love of the sacred vows of marriage. </p> <p>The dilemma such friends bring is made manifest by the deaths in his slum prisons. You cannot keep the patronage of Lord Rothermere and run a civilised justice system. It is simply impossible and only a fool would try. </p> <p>There are many reports that the strain is taking his toll. 'I must have known 35 to 40 Ministers in my time,' one union leader told me, 'and they would all be polite, whatever they thought of you - even Michael Howard. Boateng just yells.' The Prison Governors Association alleges that when it told him sickness levels among senior staff were at record levels as jails tried to cope with an ever-increasing population, Boateng replied: 'If they can't hack it, let's get rid of them.' When Boateng visited Brixton, a woman officer who was white but, along with the majority of staff, was not a racist, complained of years of underinvestment. Boateng bellowed in reply: 'That's exactly what I would expect from someone like you to say. It's people like you who are part of the problem.' She burst into tears. Her union has since complained about Boateng's boorishness. </p> <p>'Whenever he runs into a problem his only answer is to threaten privatisation,' said Harry Fletcher, of the probation workers' union, Napo. </p> <p>The bombastic style was displayed last week when Boateng had to deal with the Commons Home Affairs Committee report on the disastrous raid on Blantyre House. As this notebook has reported, the prison had the highest success rate for reforming criminals of all jails in the country. It had a liberal regime which prepared inmates for a straight life outside by allowing them to take jobs with charities and Kent employers. Inevitably, its triumphs produced many enemies in the zero-tolerance Home Office. The prison was trashed and governor forced out as 80 officers in full riot gear stormed in. </p> <p>The committee of MPs from all parties vigorously condemned the wreckers. Narey had 'misled' them when he justified the assault by saying 'a quite frightening amount of contraband had been found'. In fact, the 'contraband' was the prisoners' legally held wages, bank cards and tools for charity work. All the prisoners were tested for drugs. Not one sample was positive. </p> <p>Boateng, who had also told MPs about stashes of imaginary contraband, could have admitted his error and promised to reform his department. Instead, as Clare Checksfield from the Prison Service Secretariat revealed, the Home Office decided to bluff it out. A memo to him, passed to me by a helpful mole, suggests he should 'stand by the operational decision' to destroy the governor's career and wreck the jail and say there were no 'grounds for disciplinary action against Prison Service managers'. He did as he was told as he blustered his way round the TV studios on Thursday. </p> <p>There is a price to be paid for his machismo. You may not care greatly about feeble prisoners who are bullied or murdered.

      "bodyText": "If the colonel-in chief of the Coldstream Guards was obliged to remind his men not to shoot women and children in the back, or if Ruth Rogers had to tell her River Cafe chefs that cannibalism was a food fad too far (even for west London), you might conclude that both regiment and restaurant were staggering on the edge of barbarism. Martin Narey is director general of a more significant institution - the Prison Service. Last week, Narey felt compelled to explain to staff controlling a disproportionately large number of black inmates that they could not actually be Nazis and expect to enjoy a career in the Home Office. Membership of the British National Party would result in dismissal, he said. 'We have to own up that racism is a big problem for the prison service. This is one of a raft of measures needed to get it right.' A raft will be too small a vessel. Recent years have seen Alton Manning unlawfully killed in Blakenhurst jail and the Prison Service trying to stop an inquest's investigation into his murder or manslaughter. Meanwhile, a culture of 'sustained and promoted overtly racist behaviour' was revealed in Brixton prison. And, at the atrocious Feltham Young Offenders Institution, Zahid Mubarek was banged up with and murdered by Robert Stewart, a deranged bigot who had sent hundreds of letters from prison praising the killers of Stephen Lawrence and predicting the death of his luckless cell mate. There is a quick explanation for the violence - prison officers are attacked everywhere as white, working-class dinosaurs who frustrate the good intentions of their superiors...Yet what is striking about the toleration of the murders - and the suicides and the beatings - in the Prison Service is that the rot starts, and often stops, at the top; it breeds among well-bred politicians and senior civil servants who would be appalled if they were suspected of any bigotry in their private lives. The failed attempt to stop an inquest jury returning a true verdict of unlawful killing after it had heard how Alton Manning was dragged through a private jail by a posse of guards was planned at the highest levels of the Home Office. Mubarek's death was the result of the insouciance of its mandarins. In 1996, they gave themselves the easy target of providing racial and sexual awareness training to all employees by 2000. Result: 19 per cent of managers and 9 per cent of staff have been educated to date. In 1998, the service promised that inmates would not be forced to share a cell unless a rigorous risk-assessment had been completed. (Its incentive was the murder of Christopher Edwards. He was incarcerated with a psychopath who jumped on his face until his skull was so crushed dental records were needed to identify him.) Again, urgency descended into indolence. Paul Boateng, the Prisons Minister, admitted to the Commons this year that risk-assessments had yet to come to Feltham for all the bold commitments. If Whitehall had required officers to understand racism or judge dangers to inmates then Mubarek would not have been confined with Stewart, a man who sang the praises of the Ku Klux Klan. Boateng is the most senior black politician in British history and might be expected to care about such matters. But just as the first Labour Ministers in 1924 displayed a laughable deference to the monarchy and the first woman Prime Minister was, well, Margaret Thatcher, so the highest-flying black Minister is something of a disappointment all round. His career has followed a tired trajectory. He was an ultra-leftist on the Greater London Council in the Seventies who mellowed into a mainstream Kinnockite when the fashion changed. He is now a Third Way hard man, applauded by the Daily Mail for his harshness towards convicts, derision of social workers and love of the sacred vows of marriage. The dilemma such friends bring is made manifest by the deaths in his slum prisons. You cannot keep the patronage of Lord Rothermere and run a civilised justice system. It is simply impossible and only a fool would try. There are many reports that the strain is taking his toll. 'I must have known 35 to 40 Ministers in my time,' one union leader told me, 'and they would all be polite, whatever they thought of you - even Michael Howard. Boateng just yells.' The Prison Governors Association alleges that when it told him sickness levels among senior staff were at record levels as jails tried to cope with an ever-increasing population, Boateng replied: 'If they can't hack it, let's get rid of them.' When Boateng visited Brixton, a woman officer who was white but, along with the majority of staff, was not a racist, complained of years of underinvestment. Boateng bellowed in reply: 'That's exactly what I would expect from someone like you to say. It's people like you who are part of the problem.' She burst into tears. Her union has since complained about Boateng's boorishness. 'Whenever he runs into a problem his only answer is to threaten privatisation,' said Harry Fletcher, of the probation workers' union, Napo. The bombastic style was displayed last week when Boateng had to deal with the Commons Home Affairs Committee report on the disastrous raid on Blantyre House. As this notebook has reported, the prison had the highest success rate for reforming criminals of all jails in the country. It had a liberal regime which prepared inmates for a straight life outside by allowing them to take jobs with charities and Kent employers. Inevitably, its triumphs produced many enemies in the zero-tolerance Home Office. The prison was trashed and governor forced out as 80 officers in full riot gear stormed in. The committee of MPs from all parties vigorously condemned the wreckers. Narey had 'misled' them when he justified the assault by saying 'a quite frightening amount of contraband had been found'. In fact, the 'contraband' was the prisoners' legally held wages, bank cards and tools for charity work. All the prisoners were tested for drugs. Not one sample was positive. Boateng, who had also told MPs about stashes of imaginary contraband, could have admitted his error and promised to reform his department. Instead, as Clare Checksfield from the Prison Service Secretariat revealed, the Home Office decided to bluff it out. A memo to him, passed to me by a helpful mole, suggests he should 'stand by the operational decision' to destroy the governor's career and wreck the jail and say there were no 'grounds for disciplinary action against Prison Service managers'. He did as he was told as he blustered his way round the TV studios on Thursday. There is a price to be paid for his machismo. You may not care greatly about feeble prisoners who are bullied or murdered. But anyone who is genuinely tough on crime, rather than a poseur, should worry that Boateng would rather save his face than save the Blantyre Houses which do what he can never do: protect the public. \u0095 This week Fraser Kemp, a loyal and sweet-tempered Blairite MP, will propose a modest reform. He will ask Parliament to abolish the British Empire gongs which pepper the biannual honours list. Kemp has two arguments. First, it is no great honour to be acclaimed by an empire which does not exist and, second, he is fed up with his working-class constituents being patronised with the lesser prizes - Member of the British Empire - while the Commanders are always the aristocrats of the bureaucracy.

      "body": "<p>Two weeks ago a Labour government signed the 'unthinkable'. Smashing 50 years of ideological hostility towards private medicine, Health Minister Alan Milburn agreed a historic 'concordat' with Britain's private health industry. </p> <p>Milburn reportedly acted on Prime Minister Tony Blair's direct order to cross this Rubicon in a bid to avoid a repetition of last winter's emergency bed crisis sparked by a flu epidemic. Front page news stories featuring sick patients lying on trolleys in corridors seemed to prove the NHS was on the critical list. And this under a Government 'trusted' to run it. </p> <p>But the five-page concordat goes far deeper than averting a short-term public relations disaster by asking private hospitals to admit winter snivellers. The World Trade Organisation is lobbying for national governments to allow the private sector greater involvement in health provision and financing through what is known as Gats - General Agreement on Trade in Services. </p> <p>'With profits in manufacturing falling, the corporate lobby is targeting the proportion of gross domestic product that governments spend on public services,' said University College of London health finance expert, Professor Allyson Pollock. 'In health and education alone, government spending is in excess of 15 per cent of GDP in many European countries, but much of that goes on voluntary and public sector provision.' </p> <p>Britain is at the European cutting edge of this liberalisation. Last Monday Milburn confirmed this by inviting consortia to bid for 18 controversial new Private Finance Initiative hospitals worth \u00a318 billion. PFI is a financing mechanism which allows private companies to build hospitals and rent them back to the NHS at considerable profit. The advantage for the Treasury is that infrastructure projects are kept off balance sheet. </p> <p>Most health industry insiders acknowledge that PFI is an expensive way of building new hospitals which means less money is left to spend on patient care. But Milburn said he wants to see PFI extended 'beyond the hospital gates to include GP surgeries, community pharmacies, health centres, intermediate and long-term care facilities'. </p> <p>However, the significance of the concordat is chiefly in its effect on the direct provision of health care which has so far largely escaped the private sector. The Independent Healthcare Association (IHA) says the amount of elective surgery (operations the patient can survive without) it takes on for the NHS is worth \u00a335 million - less than 5 per cent of the sector's overall revenue, or the equivalent of six hours of the NHS's \u00a340bn annual budget. </p> <p>Currently the biggest players in private healthcare are Bupa, the provident association; BMI, owned by General Healthcare; Nuffield Hospitals, a charity; Community Hospitals Group, which is the subject of a takeover bid by Bupa; and US-owned HCA. Combined, they turn over \u00a32bn from acute health provision. The majority of this comes from private medical insurance, with 22 per cent self-paid or from overseas patients. </p> <p>These days private hospitals can treat a wide range of ailments but are known particularly for the five Hs: hips, hernias, hysterectomies, hearts and haemorrhoids. Barry Hassell, IHA's chief executive who helped frame the concordat, believes the UK's 300 private hospitals could undertake 150,000 operations for the NHS each year. This would triple private hospitals' income. Hassell says current meetings of the NHS and private healthcare providers could lead to the building of new private facilities. </p> <p>But it won't be easy to make this outsourcing work. 'There's still some hostility to contracting out client services but it may well be that the Government will push the NHS and local authorities towards agreeing contracts with the independent sector,' said leading healthcare analyst William Fitzhugh. </p> <p>It will be in the intermediate sector - or rehabilitation - where the private sector will gain most. Westminster Healthcare, run by Chai Patel - an influential government adviser - will within days be the first group since the concordat to reach agreement with the NHS to take on this work. Patel said the deals involve no more than 15 beds but it is the shape of things to come. 'The private sector can offer long-term care more efficiently, at lower cost and more competently.' </p> <p>But Steven Weeks of health workers' union Unison disagrees. 'All the evidence suggests that private sector involvement will push up the cost of long-term care. This is the main area where the private sector operates. Staff get worse wages and conditions. Some people in government will say that's not a problem.' </p> <p>Healthcare isn't always a licence to print money for the private sector. In the area of long-term care Nursing Homes Properties, which built hundreds of nursing homes in seven years, is on the verge of financial meltdown having lost \u00a37.1m in the six months to March, because a number of its tenants went to the wall. They got burnt when local authorities scaled down their fees. </p> <p>But this hasn't diminished the private sector's appetite for medicine. And so critics fear the concordat will lead to more contracted out services, charging for health care and eventually mean that what the Government - and therefore all taxpayers - can achieve with its health budget will diminish because private providers, which have to make profits, will be dearer. </p> <p>Hassell disagrees: 'What's important is that contracting authorities get value for money,' he said. 'But it's an assumption to say the private sector will be more expensive. The Department of Health won't reveal cost information so nobody knows the true picture.' Perhaps a little forensic analysis should be undertaken before we proceed with this operation. </p> <p> <strong>Sickness and wealth: What countries spend</strong><br> </p> <p>Country / % of GDP / % through public / % through provision private health insurance <br></p> <p> <strong> USA</strong> / 13.7 / 44.2 / 33.2 <br></p> <p><strong> Germany</strong> / 10.5 / 75.3 / 6.9 <br></p> <p><strong> France</strong> / 9.6 / 76.4 / 12.2 <br></p> <p><strong> Canada</strong> / 9.5 / 69.6 / 1.9 <br></p> <p><strong> Netherlands</strong> / 8.6 / 70.4 / 17.7 <br></p> <p><strong> Japan</strong> / 7.6 / 78.3 / n/a <br></p> <p><strong> UK</strong> / 7 / 84.2 / 3.5 <br></p> <p> Source: OECD</p>",

      "body": "<p>Almost uniquely international circles, the British are not much given to naming sporting arenas after public figures, not even royalty. There may be roads named after Sir Matt and Sir Stan but on the whole we tend to shy away from the aggrandisement of individuals that is so common overseas. </p> <p>Even so, I have no hesitation in suggesting that if the national athletics stadium at Picketts Lock in north-east London is eventually built, it should be named after the man most responsible for calling it into being, the Culture Secretary, Chris Smith. </p> <p>Mr Smith, it may be recalled, started the whole process last December when a sudden 'gut feeling' led him to reject the new Wembley as a venue for athletics, and in particular for the 2005 World Championships. Having turned then, the gentleman has not been for turning since. He dismissed outright a Select Committee for Culture, Media and Sport, which concluded in March that the 'platform' solution being proposed by Wembley for a temporary athletics track was 'a commendable and innovative solution.' Nor was he swayed when a report critical of Wembley's plans, commissioned by UK Sport, turned out to have been based on incorrect and incomplete information. </p> <p>Thus, after a hurried search of potential sites in London, it was announced that an alternative site for 2005 and a possible Olympic bid for 2012 had been found at Picketts Lock, and that Sport England would allocate \u00a360 million of lottery funds towards the project - \u00a320m of it culled from Wembley's \u00a3120m grant - should further consultations prove it to be viable. </p> <p>To most stadia experts, many of whom were genuinely excited and intrigued by Wembley's platform proposal, this seemed odd - pick a site, then see if it will work, then determine what facilities and events might go there. Still, having approached the Millennium Dome in a similarly unconventional manner, presumably the Government knew what it was doing. </p> <p>To be absolutely sure, nevertheless, Sport England has just provided a further \u00a31.3m to complete a detailed feasibility study at Picketts Lock. If the final conclusion, due next March, proves positive then, assuming another \u00a335m (or more, most likely) can be found to match the \u00a360m Lottery offer, work will start on the proposed stadium in March 2002. Seating 43,000 for the 2005 World Championships, the stadium would then be cut down in size to hold 20,000 thereafter; ideal for annual Grand Prix events and, the stadium's backers hope, for use by an as yet unnamed rugby union club. Saracens fans, are you reading this? </p> <p>But what if the case for Picketts Lock - call it Plan B - does not stand up to scrutiny? Having rejected Plan A (Wembley), is there a Plan C? </p> <p>The trouble with even raising this issue is that to question the development of Picketts Lock is to be deemed to be anti-athletics, while to suggest the return of athletics to Wembley is to risk being allied to the football lobby. </p> <p>Although London and the South-East may be crying out for the type of training facilities currently being proposed for Picketts Lock (including indoor 200 metre and 60m tracks, a high-performance centre and a National Institute for Sports Medicine), for the stadium itself to be viable, or even justifiable, it is likely that several athletics events would have to be transferred from provincial venues. UK Athletics insists it will retain sufficient events outside London, and that the existence of Picketts Lock will enable it to bid for other events or even create new ones. But in an increasingly competitive venue marketplace, it is hard to see how the addition of another medium-size stadium in London will help. </p> <p>More crucially, it is now widely recognised that Picketts Lock could not accommodate an Olympic Games. The former Sports Minister Tony Banks recently described its credentials as 'a joke'. But most experts I have talked to recognised this almost as soon as Picketts Lock was proposed. </p> <p>So, does the British Olympic Association and the Government admit that London can no longer bid for the games - no bad thing in many people's books - or does it try to find another site? </p> <p>If one could be found, that would mean the government spreading its largesse among three separate sites in the capital; Wembley (\u00a3100m if athletics remains elsewhere), Picketts Lock (\u00a360m at least), and a new Olympic venue, which would cost a minimum of \u00a3300m. And afterwards the stadium - a certain white elephant - would consume cash for maintenance. Again, does this add up to a sensible, cost-effective strategy, for sport, for London and, not least, for voters outside London? </p> <p>Equally, if indeed a suitable site for the Olympics does exist - Stratford in east London being one of the favourites - why isn't the new athletics stadium being built there in the first place? </p> <p>Behind all these unresolved issues lie two uncomfortable truths. The first is that London has to come up with a venue for the 2005 World Championships. If it fails, Berlin lies waiting in the wings. Having already lost the 2006 World Cup to Germany, national pride patently demands that Picketts Lock be made to work, regardless of whether it is right. </p> <p>The second is that nowhere in the world is athletics, as a sport, able to sustain and operate its own stadiums without considerable public subsidy. Athletics fans cannot even draw comfort from the success of the Sydney Olympics. On 23 November, the track graced by Cathy Freeman and others this summer will be dug up and moved to another part of the Homebush site. Stadium Australia will become an 80,000-capacity stadium for the various football codes. For all its athletes' accomplishments, by next year Australia will not have a single athletics stadium holding more than 25,000 spectators. </p> <p>Gone too are the tracks at Atlanta (1996 Olympics) and Los Angeles (1932 and 1984). Has this jeopardised America's prowess as an athletics super power? Of course not. </p> <p>In short, what Britain's athletes need is more funding and superior training facilities, not more stadiums. This is why I urge the Government to resurrect one option for London that would save a great deal of public money - if not the blushes of Chris Smith - guarantee the 2005 World Championships and, at the same time, retain a London bid for the Olympics. </p> <p>The new Wembley is due to open its gates in mid 2004. If a temporary platform for athletics were to be in place for the opening (at a cost of about \u00a310m), according to the architects this would allow the 2004 and 2005 Cup Finals, and the 2005 championships, to take place before 80,000 spectators, offering excellent sightlines for athletics and football. Afterwards, the platform would be removed with the stadium configured to its 90,000 full capacity. Wembley would retain the \u00a320m it is now trying to return to Sport England (as the price of not having to stage athletics), and, more importantly, would be able to affirm its status as a serious contender for a future Olympics. </p> <p>But that is only half of the problem solved. </p> <p>If Wembley is to accommodate the World Championships or an Olympics, it would have to offer a warm-up track. Finding the land for such a track presents obstacles but there is some ideally-placed land to the east of the current stadium, occupied by a run-down business centre.It could cost anything up to \u00a320m to buy under a series of compulsory purchase orders. </p> <p>Yet the advantages would be significant. For a further \u00a320-\u00a325m the warm-up track could be developed to accommodate up to 20,000 spectators, meaning a total bill of around \u00a345m. This venue could then fulfil the role intended for the Picketts Lock stadium while its running costs could be met in full by Wembley National Stadium Limited. WNSL is already committed to paying one per cent of its annual turnover to a trust for community and recreational purposes. According to WNSL, this should provide between \u00a31.5-\u00a32m per year, more than enough to cover the costs of the adjacent stadium, whose operation and maintenance would, in any case, be carried out by the same team responsible for Wembley. </p> <p>Good government is not only about leadership and resolve. It is about knowing when to listen, and when to pull out of an impending mess. Now is that time for Chris Smith. </p> <p>\u0095 Simon Inglis is the author of Sightlines - A Stadium Odyssey, published by Yellow Jersey Press.</p>",

      "body": "<b> 'I do not think there is any point expending campaign capital on the issue of the single currency before the issue is ready to be put'</b> <p>Press statement, Thursday </p> <p> <b> 'Pro-Europeans are making a mistake if they fail to appreciate the need for political and constitutional arguments.'</b> </p> <p>Address to businessmen, Wednesday </p> <p>Just before eight o'clock last Wednesday night, a smiling Peter Mandelson glided into the members' lobby of the House of Commons. </p> <p>He paused beneath the brooding statue of Churchill, whose foot is worn to a shine where superstitious MPs touch it for luck, for a brief chat with defence secretary Geoff Hoon, before slipping off with his duty done: voting against that night's Commons revolt on air traffic privatisation. </p> <p>What the MPs milling around him did not know, however, was that he was about to set off a revolt of his own. </p> <p>For the presses were already rolling on a front page story in the Financial Times, which would reopen Labour's rifts over the single currency once more, wrongfoot some of Mandelson's allies and crown a week in which all of Downing Street's best-laid plans for Europe went ingloriously astray. </p> <p>Mandelson had, at a supposedly private business dinner, said it was wrong to ignore the political as well as economic case for euro membership, exploding three years of Gordon Brown's polite fiction that the decision was purely about protecting jobs or investment. </p> <p>This is a message with which Robin Cook, Steve Byers and Tony Blair might agree in private - but not, at least until after the election, in public. Unfortunately, Mandelson's thoughts had found their way into the FT's first editions - plus a Guardian column - even before he stood up and uttered them. Someone was determined to ensure the message got out. </p> <p>The impact was instant. Brownites spat that their old foe 'lacked the intellectual capacity' even to talk about the euro; fellow diners complained angrily that they felt used; and the stage was set for another damaging Cabinet convulsion. </p> <p>Or was it? As so often where Mandelson is involved, the truth was not that simple. </p> <p>As he finished voting at Westminster that night, a few minutes across central London just over a dozen wealthy and well-connected businessmen were gathering around the long, polished boardroom table of a well-known international company's headquarters. </p> <p>Unilever chief Niall Fitzgerald was the host and his guests were expecting a sumptuous dinner with the Northern Ireland Secretary and reassurance that the Government had not given up on the euro. Most were potential donors to a future referendum campaign, and so they had been assured of total secrecy. </p> <p>Over coffee, Mandelson confided that in the coming six months the weak euro should begin recovering, confounding the eurosceptic attack on the 'basket case' of a currency. </p> <p>The right would then move the goalposts to making the political case against monetary union, and pro-Europeans should be ready for them. Many in the City - confused by Labour's recent retreat from discussing the single currency - wanted to hear this message. </p> <p>'The Government has been saying to pro-European business people for months \"go out and argue the case\" and frankly they are not getting that much back,' said one friend of Mandelson's. </p> <p>Others, however, believe Mandelson was simply fine-tuning his own position after taking a harder line recently in an attempt to mend fences with Brown. </p> <p>'Peter was trying to row back from his remarks a few weeks ago that the referendum wouldn't be for years,' said one long-standing ally. </p> <p>'It is nothing to do with picking a fight with Gordon Brown. It is about Peter's personal positioning, nothing bigger. </p> <p>'It really is the case that the Government is trying to close this debate down, and Peter agrees with that.' </p> <p>And that is the crucial twist in the tale: for once, this week was not about a cabal of pro-Europeans tweaking Brown's tail with the indulgence of Downing Street. Firstly Blair was irritated this time. And secondly, this was the week that the Government stumbled through being too clever by half. </p> <p>It was Neil Kinnock who most succinctly expressed the problem facing New Labour over Europe. After listening patiently to the eager delegation from Britain in Europe, outlining plans for their pro-euro campaign, he leaned forward over the desk in his spacious Brussels office and said: 'Yes, but what are you going to do about the Sun?' </p> <p>The man once crucified by an eve-of-poll front page calling on the last man in Britain to turn the lights out if he got into Downing Street has personal reasons to fear the tabloid. But his point, at that meeting three years ago, was that his successor should fear it too. </p> <p>Senior ministers regard the Eurosceptic rightwing press - chiefly the Sun, the Mail and the Telegraph - as the greatest stumbling block in the propaganda war over Europe, fuelling the public hostility charted weekly both in the polls and in Philip Gould's beloved focus groups, where Labour has been scoring badly on patriotism since the spring. </p> <p>And they realised several months ago that tabloid blood pressure would only shoot up further in the runup to the EU summit in Nice this December, at which a difficult treaty on EU enlargement will be hammered out. They wanted to spike the press's guns. </p> <p>The deal hammered out between Downing Street and Britain in Europe, with the agreement of Charles Kennedy and senior Tories, was a tactical retreat on the euro for now, focussing on the less controversial virtues of the EU instead. They would battle not over the euro, but over euroscepticism. Only after the election could the gloves come off. </p> <p>'For the next six months it is important that we maintain our discipline,' says a senior source from Britain in Europe. </p> <p>'The argument does need to be remade, but it will be made more powerfully after the election.' </p> <p>It was a fine line to tread, but for several weeks it seemed to work, so when Robin Cook upped the ante last Monday with a broadside against the eurosceptic media he only expected a minor stir. </p> <p>'The Mail, the Sun and the Telegraph we have written off. That's why we have decided to pick a fight with them,' said one source close to him. 'These papers are not contributors to the debate, they are political activists.' </p> <p>Eyebrows were raised at the regular Monday morning meeting to discuss the week's agenda: Downing Street hates upsetting tabloid readers. But Cook would have got away with it, but for a line to the press slipped out from Number 10 the next day that escaped the eagle-eyed scrutiny of press secretrary Alistair Campbell. </p> <p>A telephone call between Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac revealed differences over the bottom line on Nice, it said. Which was diplomatic code for 'whacking great row'. The headlines wrote themselves. </p> <p>By the time Mandelson's 'private' dinner was splashed all over the papers, it was beyond repair. Campbell's 'storyline' for the week was to trumpet millions of pounds for health and education and roads: but Europe, only ever meant to be background music, had swamped it. </p> <p>'This positioning for Nice caught fire and basically took us off where we wanted to be, which was on investment,' admitted one senior Whitehall source. </p> <p>Although there was no carpeting for Mandelson - most ministers privately accept he was right - Blair was irritated by the coverage and told him so. The Northern Ireland Secretary issued a soothing statement agreeing he did not want to start the campaign now. </p> <p>And despite initial growls from the Treasury, Brown appears to have accepted that for once this was not a Downing Street-sponsored raid on his territory. The truce brokered by John Prescott earlier this autumn, under which Mandelson, Cook, Byers and Brown agreed common ground on the euro, has been shaken but is holding. But there are testing times to come. </p> <p>The white-overalled workers spilling out of the gates of Sunderland's Nissan plant last week face an anxious Christmas. </p> <p>Nearly 2,000 jobs here depend on building the Micra, along with at least 10,000 jobs in the supply chain. </p> <p>The car provides a lifeline to a community that had known bitterly hard times before the Japanese arrived. Early next year Nissan will reveal whether it will build the new Micra here, guaranteeing their jobs, or inside the euro-zone in France. </p> <p>Any threat to the plant, barely three months before an election, will renew all the arguments over whether being outside the single currency is hurting British manufacturing. </p> <p>And no matter how hard Labour tried to control the debate, thousands of car workers would not let it go away. The real problem facing the Government is that it cannot, on the euro, always make the weather. </p> <p>Nor can it always allow for the regular exocets from Berlin or Paris, where the most casual remark from a foreign minister or EU commissioner is gleefully seized on to embarrass Blair. 'The problem with Brussels, basically, is Brussels and the people in it,' sighs one union source. </p> <p>The Government will try hard to push reform of the EU's creakier institutions at the Nice summit. But it may well be drowned out by arguments about the carve-up of votes between member states and the abolition of the veto on several issues, not to mention Tory howls of a federal superstate created by stealth. Even if Britain can negotiate a successful deal, Labour will need to enter the next election with a manifesto commitment to ratify it in order to force the legislation through the House of Lords. </p> <p>Once again the Government has tried to get its retaliation in early. Cook will give evidence on Nice to a Commons select committee this week, and the week after the Foreign Policy Centre - an impeccably Blairite thinktank - will publish a paper on The Future Shape of Europe with essays from Blair himself, his favourite 'third way' guru Anthony Giddens, and a string of EU foreign ministers. </p> <p>It is meant to show Blair is far from the only European leader suspicious of a 'United States of Europe.' But the lesson of this week is that unless the narrators closest to home get their story straight, there is not much chance of a happy ending abroad. </p> <p>Certainly Ken Livingstone, that other great uncontrolled force of Blairite politics who will make his own speech on the euro tomorrow, doubts that Europe really can be controlled as conviently as Labour would like. </p> <p>'No one can manage an election campaign,' he says. 'The political parties have an influence in setting the agenda, so does the media. But whatever Tony Blair does and says will never be enough, whereas if you had gone into the euro back at the beginning it would not be an issue.' </p> <p>It may be little comfort to his old adversary, but even Ken refuses to be drawn on Mandelson, however, insisting with a beatific smile that he has 'no informed comment' to offer. Tony Blair must hope his ministers take a leaf out of Red Ken's book.</p>",

Address to businessmen, Wednesday Just before eight o'clock last Wednesday night, a smiling Peter Mandelson glided into the members' lobby of the House of Commons. He paused beneath the brooding statue of Churchill, whose foot is worn to a shine where superstitious MPs touch it for luck, for a brief chat with defence secretary Geoff Hoon, before slipping off with his duty done: voting against that night's Commons revolt on air traffic privatisation. What the MPs milling around him did not know, however, was that he was about to set off a revolt of his own. For the presses were already rolling on a front page story in the Financial Times, which would reopen Labour's rifts over the single currency once more, wrongfoot some of Mandelson's allies and crown a week in which all of Downing Street's best-laid plans for Europe went ingloriously astray. Mandelson had, at a supposedly private business dinner, said it was wrong to ignore the political as well as economic case for euro membership, exploding three years of Gordon Brown's polite fiction that the decision was purely about protecting jobs or investment. This is a message with which Robin Cook, Steve Byers and Tony Blair might agree in private - but not, at least until after the election, in public. Unfortunately, Mandelson's thoughts had found their way into the FT's first editions - plus a Guardian column - even before he stood up and uttered them. Someone was determined to ensure the message got out. The impact was instant. Brownites spat that their old foe 'lacked the intellectual capacity' even to talk about the euro; fellow diners complained angrily that they felt used; and the stage was set for another damaging Cabinet convulsion. Or was it? As so often where Mandelson is involved, the truth was not that simple. As he finished voting at Westminster that night, a few minutes across central London just over a dozen wealthy and well-connected businessmen were gathering around the long, polished boardroom table of a well-known international company's headquarters. Unilever chief Niall Fitzgerald was the host and his guests were expecting a sumptuous dinner with the Northern Ireland Secretary and reassurance that the Government had not given up on the euro. Most were potential donors to a future referendum campaign, and so they had been assured of total secrecy. Over coffee, Mandelson confided that in the coming six months the weak euro should begin recovering, confounding the eurosceptic attack on the 'basket case' of a currency. The right would then move the goalposts to making the political case against monetary union, and pro-Europeans should be ready for them. Many in the City - confused by Labour's recent retreat from discussing the single currency - wanted to hear this message. 'The Government has been saying to pro-European business people for months \"go out and argue the case\" and frankly they are not getting that much back,' said one friend of Mandelson's. Others, however, believe Mandelson was simply fine-tuning his own position after taking a harder line recently in an attempt to mend fences with Brown. 'Peter was trying to row back from his remarks a few weeks ago that the referendum wouldn't be for years,' said one long-standing ally. 'It is nothing to do with picking a fight with Gordon Brown. It is about Peter's personal positioning, nothing bigger. 'It really is the case that the Government is trying to close this debate down, and Peter agrees with that.' And that is the crucial twist in the tale: for once, this week was not about a cabal of pro-Europeans tweaking Brown's tail with the indulgence of Downing Street. Firstly Blair was irritated this time. And secondly, this was the week that the Government stumbled through being too clever by half. It was Neil Kinnock who most succinctly expressed the problem facing New Labour over Europe. After listening patiently to the eager delegation from Britain in Europe, outlining plans for their pro-euro campaign, he leaned forward over the desk in his spacious Brussels office and said: 'Yes, but what are you going to do about the Sun?' The man once crucified by an eve-of-poll front page calling on the last man in Britain to turn the lights out if he got into Downing Street has personal reasons to fear the tabloid. But his point, at that meeting three years ago, was that his successor should fear it too. Senior ministers regard the Eurosceptic rightwing press - chiefly the Sun, the Mail and the Telegraph - as the greatest stumbling block in the propaganda war over Europe, fuelling the public hostility charted weekly both in the polls and in Philip Gould's beloved focus groups, where Labour has been scoring badly on patriotism since the spring. And they realised several months ago that tabloid blood pressure would only shoot up further in the runup to the EU summit in Nice this December, at which a difficult treaty on EU enlargement will be hammered out. They wanted to spike the press's guns. The deal hammered out between Downing Street and Britain in Europe, with the agreement of Charles Kennedy and senior Tories, was a tactical retreat on the euro for now, focussing on the less controversial virtues of the EU instead. They would battle not over the euro, but over euroscepticism. Only after the election could the gloves come off. 'For the next six months it is important that we maintain our discipline,' says a senior source from Britain in Europe. 'The argument does need to be remade, but it will be made more powerfully after the election.' It was a fine line to tread, but for several weeks it seemed to work, so when Robin Cook upped the ante last Monday with a broadside against the eurosceptic media he only expected a minor stir. 'The Mail, the Sun and the Telegraph we have written off. That's why we have decided to pick a fight with them,' said one source close to him. 'These papers are not contributors to the debate, they are political activists.' Eyebrows were raised at the regular Monday morning meeting to discuss the week's agenda: Downing Street hates upsetting tabloid readers. But Cook would have got away with it, but for a line to the press slipped out from Number 10 the next day that escaped the eagle-eyed scrutiny of press secretrary Alistair Campbell. A telephone call between Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac revealed differences over the bottom line on Nice, it said. Which was diplomatic code for 'whacking great row'. The headlines wrote themselves. By the time Mandelson's 'private' dinner was splashed all over the papers, it was beyond repair. Campbell's 'storyline' for the week was to trumpet millions of pounds for health and education and roads: but Europe, only ever meant to be background music, had swamped it. 'This positioning for Nice caught fire and basically took us off where we wanted to be, which was on investment,' admitted one senior Whitehall source. Although there was no carpeting for Mandelson - most ministers privately accept he was right - Blair was irritated by the coverage and told him so. The Northern Ireland Secretary issued a soothing statement agreeing he did not want to start the campaign now. And despite initial growls from the Treasury, Brown appears to have accepted that for once this was not a Downing Street-sponsored raid on his territory. The truce brokered by John Prescott earlier this autumn, under which Mandelson, Cook, Byers and Brown agreed common ground on the euro, has been shaken but is holding. But there are testing times to come. The white-overalled workers spilling out of the gates of Sunderland's Nissan plant last week face an anxious Christmas. Nearly 2,000 jobs here depend on building the Micra, along with at least 10,000 jobs in the supply chain. The car provides a lifeline to a community that had known bitterly hard times before the Japanese arrived. Early next year Nissan will reveal whether it will build the new Micra here, guaranteeing their jobs, or inside the euro-zone in France. Any threat to the plant, barely three months before an election, will renew all the arguments over whether being outside the single currency is hurting British manufacturing. And no matter how hard Labour tried to control the debate, thousands of car workers would not let it go away. The real problem facing the Government is that it cannot, on the euro, always make the weather. Nor can it always allow for the regular exocets from Berlin or Paris, where the most casual remark from a foreign minister or EU commissioner is gleefully seized on to embarrass Blair. 'The problem with Brussels, basically, is Brussels and the people in it,' sighs one union source. The Government will try hard to push reform of the EU's creakier institutions at the Nice summit. But it may well be drowned out by arguments about the carve-up of votes between member states and the abolition of the veto on several issues, not to mention Tory howls of a federal superstate created by stealth. Even if Britain can negotiate a successful deal, Labour will need to enter the next election with a manifesto commitment to ratify it in order to force the legislation through the House of Lords. Once again the Government has tried to get its retaliation in early. Cook will give evidence on Nice to a Commons select committee this week, and the week after the Foreign Policy Centre - an impeccably Blairite thinktank - will publish a paper on The Future Shape of Europe with essays from Blair himself, his favourite 'third way' guru Anthony Giddens, and a string of EU foreign ministers. It is meant to show Blair is far from the only European leader suspicious of a 'United States of Europe.' But the lesson of this week is that unless the narrators closest to home get their story straight, there is not much chance of a happy ending abroad. Certainly Ken Livingstone, that other great uncontrolled force of Blairite politics who will make his own speech on the euro tomorrow, doubts that Europe really can be controlled as conviently as Labour would like. 'No one can manage an election campaign,' he says. 'The political parties have an influence in setting the agenda, so does the media. But whatever Tony Blair does and says will never be enough, whereas if you had gone into the euro back at the beginning it would not be an issue.' It may be little comfort to his old adversary, but even Ken refuses to be drawn on Mandelson, however, insisting with a beatific smile that he has 'no informed comment' to offer. Tony Blair must hope his ministers take a leaf out of Red Ken's book.",

With a shaking hand, he managed to dial a number on his cell phone, then ran to join his heavy-hitting senior partners from Washington in a frantic huddle.</p> <p>The scene was a rerun of what political aides in both the Al Gore and George Bush camps were doing during the apparently never-ending election night.

The judge had spoken few words, read to the waiting world by a gasping Terry Cass, spokeswoman for Leon County Court.

After his announcement, the highest-earning attorneys in America and the politicians themselves went into meltdown. Bush left his Texas ranch for the state capital, Austin, preparing to follow his father across the White House welcome mat.</p> <p>In Washington, Gore - clinging by his fingernails to the dream for which he was groomed - called campaign manager Bill Daley, who told him: 'It's not good. But wait, wait'. It was 10.08am, and Harris duly prepared to declare the state, and in effect the presidency, for Bush.</p> <p>The sartorially enviable Harris wardrobe contains two hats: wearing one, she is the Mata Hari of the Floridian Republican Party and chairwoman of the Bush campaign along with the state's Governor, George Dubya's brother, Jeb Bush. Wearing the other, she is the highest, supposedly neutral, official in the process of managing elections. And so far as she was concerned last week, the dawn of the Florida sun yesterday was always intended to bring a final end of the longest elec tion night in recent American history. It was to happen once the deadline for counting absentee ballots had passed at midnight last Friday, giving Bush a lead of 760 votes.</p> <p>But all week, there had been a persistent irritant to Harris's plan. It lay inside a building at the junction of Military Trail Boulevard and Gun Club Road, opposite the Mermaid stripclub on the scrappy edges of West Palm Beach. It is the Emergency Operations Centre, usually concerned with hurricane evacuation; only this time, the disaster was man-made.</p> <p>While Judge Lewis's verdict was read, teams of volunteers and local government employees in an auditorium continued the West Palm Beach manual count. The same was happening down the coast in Broward and it was about to restart in sprawling Miami-Dade.</p> <p>The counters in Palm Beach had been counting nothing but minutes and hours since Monday, waiting for the legal skies to at least partially clear so they could begin tabulating votes instead.</p> <p>The motions to recount had been lodged, thwarted and re-lodged, and had finally been given the go-ahead on Thursday by the Florida Supreme Court. There was sudden flurry and hush as elections supervisor Theresa LaPore entered, carrying two grey metal cases full of ballot papers. She read out the rules: no talking to the political party monitors; no eating at the tables - all that had hitherto happened in the windowless room under huge yellow air conditioning ducts.</p> <p>But now the judge had ruled that these key counts - would almost certainly count for nothing. Democrats' hopes were further dashed by another vote-count being faxed, phoned and emailed to the state capital, Tallahassee, on Friday. Ballot papers from voters overseas were mounting slowly to crank up Bush's majority of 300 to 342 by early evening.</p> <p>Then, suddenly, came a volte-face that echoed both the election itself and the endless seesaw since. Just as Florida was wrapped in a tangerine dusk, the six judges in the state Supreme Court delivered a verdict that sent the drama back into vortex where it has been entrapped for nearly two weeks.</p> <p>The court handed down an order forbidding Harris's certification of the Florida result for Bush, at least for now. Gore, back in Washington and back from the brink, dispatched cookies and coffee to reporters huddled in the cold. The snacks were followed by the man himself; 'Hi,' he said, in a gravelly voice.</p> <p>The judges decreed that it was awry for Harris to declare the state for Bush ahead of the manual count, which should continue. The court will reconvene tomorrow at 2pm and hear arguments from both sides, before reaching a final verdict.</p> <p>And so the count goes on, with the Democrats anticipating that by the time the judges next meet, there will be 'factual evidence' - that is, enough votes for Gore - to invalidate Harris's certification while another result is possible, if not probable.</p> <p>These seven justices due to sit were all appointed by former Democrat Governors Bob Graham and Lawton Chiles, except one who was jointly appointed with Jeb Bush. Six are Democrats, one an independent.</p> <p>The court has a reputation for detachment from politics - Governor Chiles lost as many cases in it as he won - but this time the chips are down. There have been no 'rebellions' in Florida so far by anyone with a political affiliation - except by Judge Lewis, a Democrat who wrote a thriller in 1997 entitled Conflict of Interests. Indeed, the question hanging over the denouement to this election is whether the law is above politics, or vice-versa.</p> <p>Another two hours passed during which the Federal Appeals Court in Atlanta rejected a further plea by the Bush camp for the manual recounts to be stopped.</p> <p>With the Bush side now appealing through the federal system he derides, it is now conceivable that if the appointment of the forty-third President of the United States is not concluded by a handful of votes, it could go all the way to the Supreme Court in Washington.</p> <p>Litigation is the American way. When the political process fails, you file a lawsuit, over anything from slavery to cigarettes. In the Sixties, civil rights litigators created a model for forcing social reform through the courts. In their wake came legal battles over abortion, tobacco and gun control, creating laws that Congress was unable or unwilling to pass.</p> <p>It started with the 'Dred Scott' case of 1857, when the Supreme Court ruled it had no right to ban slavery in the South, thereby detonating the Civil War. But no one really expected the presidency itself to go the same way - tearing America apart once again in the process.</p> <p>Watching Florida's week of endless litigation has been like inspecting apparently smooth skin through a microscope to reveal every pore and minuscule wart, every strength and weakness of democracy. Behind the severity of the motions, counter-motions and name-calling have been golden moments of democratic farce. There were the open-air meetings of the Palm Beach canvassing board, demanded by Florida's open government 'Sunshine Laws'. Or the Republicans in Broward County finding a bundle of ballot 'chads' - the crucial slips of paper in a ballot sheet that are supposed to have been punched out to register a vote - in a rubbish bag.</p> <p>There is the debate over what kind of unpunched 'chad' (a 'hanging' or 'pregnant chad') does, or does not, constitute an intended vote. 'In Palm Beach,' said Bruce Rogaw, a lawyer for the county, 'we're not interested in pregnancy, only in penetration'. The hookers along the beach have a new lexicon to play with, offering clients a 'manual recount'.</p> <p>Yet in reality, the whole affair is deadly serious. If Gore wins this election, it will be because he is a dog-fighter without equal, who will have directed the most determined, take-no-prisoners legal marathon in American political history. His generals in that victory will be have been a hit-squad of lawyers which descended on Florida armed with stardom rather than ideological zeal.</p> <p>Among them are Harvard Professor Laurence Tribe, who is America's leading constitutional lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, who was counsel to such celebrities as O.J. Simpson and Claus Von Bulow, and David Boies who mauled Microsoft through the federal courts. Boies has now been hired by Gore to break up another trust, this time before it becomes a monopoly: the Bush dynasty.</p> <p>The Bush phalanx is more political. It is headed by Theodore Olson, a Washington fixer welded to the hard Right. Olson's very presence serves as a sign that if Gore wins, his presidency will unleash an opposition fuelled by a level of bitterness to which even Bill Clinton was not subjected.</p> <p>Olson was a partner of Kenneth Starr and hosted a meeting in 1996 - revealed by The Observer two years ago - which collated the ultra-conservative political effort behind Paula Jones' lawsuit against Clinton, the germ of the impeachment drama. This was in his capacity as chairman of the board of the extreme American Spectator magazine, which first prised apart the President's sex life.</p> <p>But if Bush wins, it will not be because of Olson but because Jeb Bush's machine in Florida worked the system to a fault. Last week small men and women walked tall, and those of medium size became overnight power-brokers way above their station.</p> <p>And on the Republican side, it was Katherine Harris's week. On Tuesday night, she declared Bush the winner and the manual recounts invalid. On Thursday, she reported that the three rebel counties had reported their reasons for a manual count within her prescribed deadline - 'and I thank them', she smiled sweetly, before dismissing every single one of their demands.</p> <p>Married to a Swedish businessman she met on a blind date to see Verdi's opera The Force of Destiny, Harris's CV is propelled by political ambition. Although her job is concerned with internal affairs, she has travelled more on Florida's business than any other official, to such places as Barbados, Brazil and Sydney. She said recently she had a 'passionate interest' in an ambassadorship under a Bush administration.</p> <p>She was elected to the state senate in 1994 under a cloud. An insurance company, Riscorp, had donated $20,000 to her campaign which was made up of contributions employees had been ordered to make. The staff were later reimbursed with bonus cheques and falsified expenses. Riscorp's founder, Bill Griffin, was jailed for his part in the scandal.</p> <p>Harris said she did not know where the money came from, and returned it. But inquiries by The Observer have uncovered a memo of September 1994 from Griffin's private secretary to Riscorp's chief financial officer which suggests otherwise:</p> <p>'Katherine's office called,' it reads, 'and asked if we could give them different addresses to list for each of the checks. All the checks show the PO Box 1598 address. If we submit these, the newspaper will probably make the connection and track them all to Riscorp.'</p> <p>Harris insisted last week that she has acted with strict regard to the law rather than partisan politics . Her spokeswoman says there is a 'firewall' between her office and the Republican Party. Jeb Bush likewise pledged that he had withdrawn from the entire fracas.</p> <p>But state officials tell The Observer about the silent hand of Jeb still guiding what the Governor hopes will be the victory he was expected to deliver for his brother - on pain of virtual expulsion from the dynasty. Since election day, five of Jeb Bush's top aides have taken 'unpaid leave' to work for Harris and the Republicans.</p> <p>The night after the election, Harris dined with another veteran Republican, John 'Mac' Stipanovich, who ran Jeb's 1994 election campaign and to whom Harris turned first in formulating her strategy over the presidential result. Even Republican Party officials admit that Stipanovich plays a double role: his law firm, Fowler White, has been retained by the party to monitor the counts, while he himself advises Harris both on the law and on her every move.</p> <p>The politicisation goes all the way down to Florida's roots. The Palm Beach canvassing commission's open-air meetings are riven between Carol Roberts, the Democrat who said she would go to jail rather than stop counting, and her Republican chairman Charles Burton, who has tried to stall the counting on advice from a Republican lawyer in the county offices.</p> <p>Even the banter during the count is political: a wisecracking Democrat lawyer called Newman reads out the rules on vote-counting signed into law by George Bush in Texas, which give manual counting 'precedence' over machine counting, and insist that 'hanging' and 'pregnant chads' count as votes - the diametric opposite of Bush's argument in Florida.</p> <p>A Republican, Mark Wallace, objects. The beleaguered Theresa LaPore barks: 'Mr Wallace, can we avoid political speeches with every objection?' 'That goes for both sides,' retorts Wallace.</p> <p>The only people keeping their heads in Florida were those doing the counting. 'I was in Vietnam defending the American process,' says Tom McLaughlin. 'That's why I'm here.' He adds: 'When it's this close, the machine shouldn't count the vote.'</p> <p>Pat Woodward, a retired IBM employee, regarded the count as 'right at the top of the list of things I have done in my life'. But not so retired teacher Hecksie Brock, a Republican: 'I'm a mother and I'm a grandmother, and this is not at the top of things I have done. I had a grandson die at two-and-a-half months of sudden infant death syndrome in 1989. The recount is very important, but it pales in importance in my life.'</p> <p>No one, however, expects Al Gore or George Bush - or the massed columns assembled around them - to agree.</p> <p><b> Democrats:</b></p> <p>\u0095 Every vote should count and, in Florida law, be counted to assess the voter's intention. If that happens, we think we can win in the end. When is our 'finality'? When we're ahead in the Florida vote - including hand counts?</p> <p>\u0095 Say that the process can be speedy - but admit it could stretch into December. 'The American people are patient people.'</p> <p>\u0095 Hire ever more expensive lawyers.</p> <p>\u0095 Use the Vice-President from Washington mansion on TV to look presidential. Always remember that this is more politics than law. Be statesmanlike and concerned (and keep campaign chairman William Daley under wraps).</p> <p>\u0095 Try to find the high ground - thus Gore's offer of a statewide hand recount, including Republican counties - but encourage heavily Democratic counties like Miami-Dade to recount.</p> <p><b> Republicans:</b></p> <p>\u0095 Get it over with (because, after two full machine counts, we're in the lead).</p> <p>\u0095 Pretend that George W. Bush is the inevitable victor, the next President who should be building a Cabinet now in the national interest.</p> <p>\u0095 Visualise - in public - a process stretching ahead for weeks if not months. 'When will it end? When will there be finality?' (James Baker).</p> <p>\u0095 Construct deadlines - first, yesterday's delayed certification of the vote; now Thanksgiving on Thursday, when the people 'need and deserve' an answer. Americans want to eat turkey not watch politicians talk it.</p> <p>\u0095 Attack Democrats as unprincipled launchers of law suits. Launch Republican law suits as necessary. Attack Florida's Democrat-appointed Supreme Court judges as partisan creatures.</p> <p>\u0095 Defend Secretary of State Katherine Harris (and Bush campaign co-chair) as fine public servant. Describe hand counting as messy, chaotic, unprincipled and possibly rigged.</p> <p>\u0095 Invent more ludicrous adjectives to hang on chads.</p> <p>\u0095 Claim that hand-counting in Texas (signed into law by George W. Bush) is different.</p> <p>\u0095 Basic calculation: if the Democrats can build up a hand count lead, to add to their electoral college and popular vote leads, we're in trouble. Every day the hand counting goes on, makes that more likely. Stop it now!</p> <p><b> Who's winning?</b></p> <p>The Democrats are still behind, but the Florida Supreme Court on Monday is crucial. If that court allows the hand counts and delays certification of the result to include them, then Gore has the advantage. But will it in all the recounting counties, or just Palm Beach? The hand counting numbers aren't rolling back Bush's lead yet. Gore might simply lose on the vote, however counted.</p> <p>\u0095 Call in more lawyers</p> <p><b> by Peter Preston in Washington</b></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,398516,00.html\">Election glossary </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,397459,00.html\"> Analysis: constitution heads for meltdown</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/1115Freedland.ra\">Jonathan Freedland in Palm Beach (3mins 35)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/1117ellison.ra\">Michael Ellison in Tallahassee (2mins 26)</a><br></p> <p><b>Local media</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.herald.com/\" target=\"_new\">Miami Herald</a><br><a href=\"http://www.tdo.com/\" target=\"_new\">Tallahassee Democrat</a><br><a href=\"http://www.gopbi.com/partners/pbpost/epaper/editions/today/\" target=\"_new\">Palm Beach Post</a><br><a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/\">Sun Sentinel</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidentelect.org/results.html\" target=\"_new\">The latest state of the count</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.policy.com/news/dbrief/dbriefarc770.asp\" target=\"_new\">Arguments for and against reform</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.truthinmedia.org/Columns/Electoral-College.html\" target=\"_new\">Origins of the Electoral College</a><br><a href=\"http://www.kscourts.org/lawwise/marwise.htm\" target=\"_new\">How the system works</a><br><a href=\"http://www.research.att.com/~lorrie/pubs/diss/footnode.html#377\" target=\"_NEW\">A learned definition of chad</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.research.att.com/~lorrie/pubs/diss/node5.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Academic analysis of US voting systems</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/\" target=\"_NEW\">US Federal Election Commission (FEC) </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/pages/punchrd.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">FEC explanation of the punchcard ballot</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The verdict from Judge Terry P. Lewis of Leon County was passed down through the sweltering heat of Friday morning, and the hurricane of lawyers blowing through Florida swirled into a typhoon. The colour drained fastest from the face of Dexter Douglass, the Democratic Party's lead attorney in Florida. With a shaking hand, he managed to dial a number on his cell phone, then ran to join his heavy-hitting senior partners from Washington in a frantic huddle. The scene was a rerun of what political aides in both the Al Gore and George Bush camps were doing during the apparently never-ending election night. Only now it was the lawyers' turn. And like the second Florida 'result' on election night, Lewis's verdict seemed to spell the beginning of the end of the election, of a long week in court and of Gore's hopes. Republican attorneys also plunged into conclave to plan the next move, barely concealing their surprised elation. The judge had spoken few words, read to the waiting world by a gasping Terry Cass, spokeswoman for Leon County Court. But with them, Lewis in effect snatched the presidency for Bush by handing the contested result of the state's pivotal vote into the hands of a woman who has been catapulted to prominence more than any other figure in this election: Florida's Secretary of State, Katherine Harris. Lewis ruled that Harris had used 'proper discretion' in refusing to accept the result of manual counting of 1.5 million votes in three disputed counties on which Gore's hopes were pinned: Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade. Ten long days ago, no one had had heard of Judge Lewis, who writes murder mysteries on the side. After his announcement, the highest-earning attorneys in America and the politicians themselves went into meltdown. Bush left his Texas ranch for the state capital, Austin, preparing to follow his father across the White House welcome mat. In Washington, Gore - clinging by his fingernails to the dream for which he was groomed - called campaign manager Bill Daley, who told him: 'It's not good. But wait, wait'. It was 10.08am, and Harris duly prepared to declare the state, and in effect the presidency, for Bush. The sartorially enviable Harris wardrobe contains two hats: wearing one, she is the Mata Hari of the Floridian Republican Party and chairwoman of the Bush campaign along with the state's Governor, George Dubya's brother, Jeb Bush. Wearing the other, she is the highest, supposedly neutral, official in the process of managing elections. And so far as she was concerned last week, the dawn of the Florida sun yesterday was always intended to bring a final end of the longest elec tion night in recent American history. It was to happen once the deadline for counting absentee ballots had passed at midnight last Friday, giving Bush a lead of 760 votes. But all week, there had been a persistent irritant to Harris's plan. It lay inside a building at the junction of Military Trail Boulevard and Gun Club Road, opposite the Mermaid stripclub on the scrappy edges of West Palm Beach. It is the Emergency Operations Centre, usually concerned with hurricane evacuation; only this time, the disaster was man-made. While Judge Lewis's verdict was read, teams of volunteers and local government employees in an auditorium continued the West Palm Beach manual count. The same was happening down the coast in Broward and it was about to restart in sprawling Miami-Dade. The counters in Palm Beach had been counting nothing but minutes and hours since Monday, waiting for the legal skies to at least partially clear so they could begin tabulating votes instead. The motions to recount had been lodged, thwarted and re-lodged, and had finally been given the go-ahead on Thursday by the Florida Supreme Court. There was sudden flurry and hush as elections supervisor Theresa LaPore entered, carrying two grey metal cases full of ballot papers. She read out the rules: no talking to the political party monitors; no eating at the tables - all that had hitherto happened in the windowless room under huge yellow air conditioning ducts. But now the judge had ruled that these key counts - would almost certainly count for nothing. Democrats' hopes were further dashed by another vote-count being faxed, phoned and emailed to the state capital, Tallahassee, on Friday. Ballot papers from voters overseas were mounting slowly to crank up Bush's majority of 300 to 342 by early evening. Then, suddenly, came a volte-face that echoed both the election itself and the endless seesaw since. Just as Florida was wrapped in a tangerine dusk, the six judges in the state Supreme Court delivered a verdict that sent the drama back into vortex where it has been entrapped for nearly two weeks. The court handed down an order forbidding Harris's certification of the Florida result for Bush, at least for now.

Indeed, the question hanging over the denouement to this election is whether the law is above politics, or vice-versa. Another two hours passed during which the Federal Appeals Court in Atlanta rejected a further plea by the Bush camp for the manual recounts to be stopped. With the Bush side now appealing through the federal system he derides, it is now conceivable that if the appointment of the forty-third President of the United States is not concluded by a handful of votes, it could go all the way to the Supreme Court in Washington. Litigation is the American way. When the political process fails, you file a lawsuit, over anything from slavery to cigarettes. In the Sixties, civil rights litigators created a model for forcing social reform through the courts. In their wake came legal battles over abortion, tobacco and gun control, creating laws that Congress was unable or unwilling to pass.

But no one really expected the presidency itself to go the same way - tearing America apart once again in the process. Watching Florida's week of endless litigation has been like inspecting apparently smooth skin through a microscope to reveal every pore and minuscule wart, every strength and weakness of democracy. Behind the severity of the motions, counter-motions and name-calling have been golden moments of democratic farce. There were the open-air meetings of the Palm Beach canvassing board, demanded by Florida's open government 'Sunshine Laws'.

Although her job is concerned with internal affairs, she has travelled more on Florida's business than any other official, to such places as Barbados, Brazil and Sydney. She said recently she had a 'passionate interest' in an ambassadorship under a Bush administration. She was elected to the state senate in 1994 under a cloud.

Republicans: \u0095 Get it over with (because, after two full machine counts, we're in the lead). \u0095 Pretend that George W. Bush is the inevitable victor, the next President who should be building a Cabinet now in the national interest. \u0095 Visualise - in public - a process stretching ahead for weeks if not months. 'When will it end? When will there be finality?' (James Baker). \u0095 Construct deadlines - first, yesterday's delayed certification of the vote; now Thanksgiving on Thursday, when the people 'need and deserve' an answer. Americans want to eat turkey not watch politicians talk it. \u0095 Attack Democrats as unprincipled launchers of law suits. Launch Republican law suits as necessary. Attack Florida's Democrat-appointed Supreme Court judges as partisan creatures. \u0095 Defend Secretary of State Katherine Harris (and Bush campaign co-chair) as fine public servant. Describe hand counting as messy, chaotic, unprincipled and possibly rigged. \u0095 Invent more ludicrous adjectives to hang on chads. \u0095 Claim that hand-counting in Texas (signed into law by George W. Bush) is different. \u0095 Basic calculation: if the Democrats can build up a hand count lead, to add to their electoral college and popular vote leads, we're in trouble. Every day the hand counting goes on, makes that more likely. Stop it now! Who's winning? The Democrats are still behind, but the Florida Supreme Court on Monday is crucial. If that court allows the hand counts and delays certification of the result to include them, then Gore has the advantage. But will it in all the recounting counties, or just Palm Beach? The hand counting numbers aren't rolling back Bush's lead yet. Gore might simply lose on the vote, however counted. \u0095 Call in more lawyers by Peter Preston in Washington Related stories Election glossary Analysis: constitution heads for meltdown Audio Jonathan Freedland in Palm Beach (3mins 35) Michael Ellison in Tallahassee (2mins 26) Local media Miami Herald Tallahassee Democrat Palm Beach Post Sun Sentinel Useful links The latest state of the count Arguments for and against reform Origins of the Electoral College How the system works A learned definition of chad Academic analysis of US voting systems US Federal Election Commission (FEC) FEC explanation of the punchcard ballot",

      "body": "<p>We are, let's face it, flabbergasted at the size of England's first innings in Lahore on a pitch that was supposed to disintegrate and allow all and sundry a day off today. But the manner in which the key contributors to that total of 480-8 declared scored their runs has not been so surprising - except in the case of Craig White.</p> <p> Graham Thorpe diligently nudged and ran for more than seven devoted hours. Mike Atherton oozed phlegm as he usually does, and it has now reached a stage where we are not so taken aback when Marcus Trescothick looks comfortable in the Test arena. This pair are bright enough to realise that Pakistan is one of the few venues in the cricket ing world where it is a definite bonus to be an opening batsman. For once runs are easier to come by against the new, hard ball, a rare consolation for having to open up against McGrath, Donald, Pollock or Walsh in other climes. But Craig White had us blinking. </p> <p>His was the most assertive innings among the English batsmen, which, as Thorpe readily admitted, 'made life easier for me'. It was aggressive, yet controlled, unlike the extravagant effort of Shahid Afridi on Friday, whose enterprise gave way to wanton irresponsibility.</p> <p> White's 93 displayed courage and good sense, qualities rarely seen in England's lower order in recent times. When he came to the crease at 225-5 the standard, old pro-ish advice would have been 'hang in there with Thorpey; keep an end up and try to eke out a few more runs. Don't do anything rash.' White was bright and brave enough to take an alternative route. </p> <p>If he had dutifully propped and cocked, the chances are that he would have been snapped up by Saqlain. Fine technicians like Atherton and Thorpe may be able to survive by wearing down their opponents, but White, surprisingly diffident by nature given his Aussie background, would never claim their technical excellence. </p> <p>Instead he opted to assert his authority. Soon he was jumping down the wicket to Saqlain and driving him over mid-off; Shahid Afridi, underbowled in that first innings, was deposited over the ropes for six - a long way at Lahore. These were high-risk strokes. A slight error of judgment, a ballooned catch to the outfield and he may have encountered a grimace from his captain (even though Hussain had tried this ploy and failed); more certainly he would have been castigated by the press corps for his 'irresponsibility'. </p> <p>However, he had the nerve to strike the ball rather than just survive and his self-belief mushroomed. Thereafter, with his authority established and his score in the thirties, he was confident that he could cope against the spinners without playing any 'big' shots. </p> <p> It is not only White's runs in Lahore which will affect how England approach the rest of this series. His bowling, often underestimated in the past by opposition batsmen, has also been hugely impressive. He is rarely wayward and considerably faster than his shortish run-up would have you believe.</p> <p>White finished with figures of 3-48 at the end of the fourth day's play in Lahore, making him England's most effective bowler - so it seems the England tour management now have a genuine Test all-rounder at their disposal. If conditions are like this in Faisalabad and Karachi, two spinners will be essential. Now they can contemplate White coming in at seven with some confidence. </p> <p>As White's Test career blossoms, a couple of England coaches will be smiling. Ray Illingworth spotted his talent back in 1994 and picked him in the hope that he would be the magical rabbit plucked out of a Pudsey hat. In fact White himself acknowledges that he was not ready for Test cricket when first selected. Fletcher has since resurrected his career, insisting on a central contract for him last April which no one expected. His hunch was correct, and in 2000 the timing was right, for White has matured. In the past his diffidence may have been a handicap; he remains endearingly self-effacing, but now he enters the harsh arena of Test cricket as if he belongs there. </p>",

      "bodyText": "We are, let's face it, flabbergasted at the size of England's first innings in Lahore on a pitch that was supposed to disintegrate and allow all and sundry a day off today. But the manner in which the key contributors to that total of 480-8 declared scored their runs has not been so surprising - except in the case of Craig White. Graham Thorpe diligently nudged and ran for more than seven devoted hours. Mike Atherton oozed phlegm as he usually does, and it has now reached a stage where we are not so taken aback when Marcus Trescothick looks comfortable in the Test arena. This pair are bright enough to realise that Pakistan is one of the few venues in the cricket ing world where it is a definite bonus to be an opening batsman. For once runs are easier to come by against the new, hard ball, a rare consolation for having to open up against McGrath, Donald, Pollock or Walsh in other climes. But Craig White had us blinking. His was the most assertive innings among the English batsmen, which, as Thorpe readily admitted, 'made life easier for me'. It was aggressive, yet controlled, unlike the extravagant effort of Shahid Afridi on Friday, whose enterprise gave way to wanton irresponsibility. White's 93 displayed courage and good sense, qualities rarely seen in England's lower order in recent times. When he came to the crease at 225-5 the standard, old pro-ish advice would have been 'hang in there with Thorpey; keep an end up and try to eke out a few more runs. Don't do anything rash.' White was bright and brave enough to take an alternative route. If he had dutifully propped and cocked, the chances are that he would have been snapped up by Saqlain. Fine technicians like Atherton and Thorpe may be able to survive by wearing down their opponents, but White, surprisingly diffident by nature given his Aussie background, would never claim their technical excellence. Instead he opted to assert his authority. Soon he was jumping down the wicket to Saqlain and driving him over mid-off; Shahid Afridi, underbowled in that first innings, was deposited over the ropes for six - a long way at Lahore. These were high-risk strokes. A slight error of judgment, a ballooned catch to the outfield and he may have encountered a grimace from his captain (even though Hussain had tried this ploy and failed); more certainly he would have been castigated by the press corps for his 'irresponsibility'. However, he had the nerve to strike the ball rather than just survive and his self-belief mushroomed. Thereafter, with his authority established and his score in the thirties, he was confident that he could cope against the spinners without playing any 'big' shots. It is not only White's runs in Lahore which will affect how England approach the rest of this series. His bowling, often underestimated in the past by opposition batsmen, has also been hugely impressive. He is rarely wayward and considerably faster than his shortish run-up would have you believe. White finished with figures of 3-48 at the end of the fourth day's play in Lahore, making him England's most effective bowler - so it seems the England tour management now have a genuine Test all-rounder at their disposal. If conditions are like this in Faisalabad and Karachi, two spinners will be essential. Now they can contemplate White coming in at seven with some confidence. As White's Test career blossoms, a couple of England coaches will be smiling. Ray Illingworth spotted his talent back in 1994 and picked him in the hope that he would be the magical rabbit plucked out of a Pudsey hat. In fact White himself acknowledges that he was not ready for Test cricket when first selected. Fletcher has since resurrected his career, insisting on a central contract for him last April which no one expected. His hunch was correct, and in 2000 the timing was right, for White has matured. In the past his diffidence may have been a handicap; he remains endearingly self-effacing, but now he enters the harsh arena of Test cricket as if he belongs there.",

      "body": "<p>Prince Charles may have jumped the gun in attributing the floods of the past few weeks to mankind's 'arrogant disregard' for the delicate balance of nature, but scientists are generally agreed that prolific generation of greenhouse gases is causing changes to the climate. </p> <p>Half of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions are caused by heat escaping from our homes; a further quarter is generated by our cars. So we really can make a difference by cutting back our personal use of the carbon fuels that generate greenhouse gases. </p> <p>Saving energy saves money, too. Professor Max Fordham, one of the country's leading specialists in heating, water supply and electrical installations, has estimated that the ultimate wish-list for converting an old home into an energy efficient one - including adding insulation to walls, installing a natural light energy system, plus a range of energy efficient appliances - could cost up to \u00a323,000. This is beyond the pockets of most homeowners, but there are still plenty of affordable things you can do. <a href=\"http://www.est.co.uk\">The Energy Savings Trust</a> estimates that simple energy awareness could save a typical household \u00a3250 a year. </p> <p>A good starting point is your local Energy Efficiency Advice Centre (call 0800 512012 for your nearest branch). It will provide a questionnaire about the age and size of your home. Depending on your answers, the EEAC will recommend changes, estimate how much these will cost, and how much money they will save you. The service is free. Several private companies offer a similar service, but charge anything from \u00a350 to \u00a3150. The EEAC's recommendations may include: </p> <p> <strong> Boilers</strong> </p> <p> If your boiler is more than 15 years old, it is significantly less efficient than a modern one. You could save a fifth of your fuel bill if you switch to a new one - even more if you buy a condensing boiler. These convert 85 per cent of fuel into heat, compared with 65 per cent to 75 per cent for a standard boiler. However they cost more to buy (the cheapest versions at B&amp;Q cost \u00a3554, compared with \u00a3389), and produce water vapour, so you need a drain for the condensation. </p> <p>Households that use oil or liquid petroleum gas rather than gas or electricity for heating may qualify for a grant of up to \u00a3250 by replacing their old boiler with a condensing boiler and installing heating controls. The EST estimates that a small three-bedroom semi could save \u00a3100 a year with a condensing boiler. </p> <p> <strong> Lagging tanks and pipes</strong> </p> <p> Water stays hot longer if your tank and pipes are insulated properly. The jacket should be 3 inches thick and cover the entire tank, and your hot water pipes should be insulated along their entire length, but particularly between the boiler and the hot water tank. Expect to pay between \u00a35 and \u00a310 for a tank cover and \u00a31 for three metres of pipe lagging. Annual saving: \u00a320 for the water tank, a further \u00a35 for the pipes. </p> <p> <strong> Fridge/freezers</strong> </p> <p> Manufacturers have not been allowed to use CFCs for several years, but the most commonly used refrigerant, R134a, while not quite so damaging to the ozone layer, is still a greenhouse gas. If you want to help the environment, check that the appliance you buy uses the newer refrigerant, R600a, which does not damage the ozone layer and is not a significant greenhouse gas </p> <p>Also, check energy ratings: appliances are rated from A to C, with A using the least energy. Which ? magazine recently tested fridge freezers, and found that of five appliances that claimed to have an A rating, only two - the Zanussi ZA25 and the Bosch KGE32 65GB - lived up to the manufacturers' claims. </p> <p> <strong> Washing machines</strong> </p> <p> Modern detergents work just as well at lower temperatures unless you have very dirty washing, and you can cut electricity use by using a 40 degree rather than 60 degree cycle. Wait until you have a full load to run the machine. </p> <p> <strong> Loft lagging</strong> </p> <p> You can do this yourself, but use goggles, mask and gloves, as the lagging fleece is irritating to skin. The recommended depth is 8in, with 4in across joists. However you should not block ventilation openings from the eaves, and do not lag underneath your water tank, as this may cause it to freeze in winter. </p> <p>Lagging costs from \u00a34.67 for an eight-metre roll, but bear in mind that you would need a double thickness to achieve the desired 8 inches. Expect to save 20 per cent on your fuel bills, or about \u00a335 a year for a small three-bedroom house. </p> <p> <strong> Low-energy light bulbs</strong> </p> <p> One of the easiest ways to save money. The initial outlay may seem expensive - the most expensive at B&amp;Q costs \u00a322.98 compared with \u00a31.09 for a pack of four normal lightbulbs, but it should last for 15 years and use one fifth of the energy. They are best used in places where you have lights on most often and for longest, simply because they will save you the most money this way. Annual saving \u00a310 per bulb. </p> <p> <strong> Green - but not money-savers</strong> </p> <p> For a real test of your environmental credentials, there are several products you can use that will cause less damage to the environment, but are likely to cost the same or slightly more. </p> <p> <strong> Green energy</strong> </p> <p> Burning coal, oil and gas in power stations to produce electricity also produces vast quantities of CO2 and other polluting greenhouse gases responsible for climate change. However, several utility companies now offer green tariffs, where you pay for green energy supplied by renewable energy projects such as hydro-electricity, wind and wave generators. </p> <p>Friends of the Earth has rated companies offering green tariffs according to whether they offer customers the chance to buy green energy, their record for energy-efficiency and pollution, and their environmental policy and that of their parent company. Ecotricity and Unit[e] scored best. </p> <p>For details visit the organisation's website at <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/campaigns/\">www.foe.co.uk</a>.</p> <p>For information about prices and how to switch providers, contact Ofgem on 0800 887777 or visit its website at <a href=\"http://www.ofgem.org.uk\">www.ofgem.org.uk</a>. </p> <p> <strong> Low VOC-content paint</strong> </p> <p> Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are solvents and other chemicals in paints that evaporate during use. They are released into the atmosphere and react with nitrogen oxides, contributing to atmospheric pollution. They may also be linked to certain health problems, including asthma. </p> <p>You can help by using paint with low VOC content - emulsions use water rather than synthetic solvents, and typically contain less than 4 per cent VOCs. Gloss and varnishes need higher VOC levels (between 40 and 80 per cent). B&amp;Q labels paints to show level of VOCs. </p> <p> <strong> Timber products from well-managed forests</strong> </p> <p> The Forest Stewardship Council is a global organisation that sets standards for and assesses the management of woodland around the world. Look for timber and products made from wood (everything from doors to toilet seats) carrying the Forest Stewardship Council label. </p> <p>Look on the <a href=\"http://www.fsc-uk.demon.co.uk\">FSC's website</a> - for further information about the scheme and retailers that stock approved products.</p> <p><strong>How to step off the gas</strong></p> <p>The simplest way to save money and cut emissions from your car is not to use it. Some people car-share; others switch to bikes. But if these are not options for you, how can you become a greener driver? </p> <p>Petrol engines are less efficient than diesel, and emit more CO2, CO and hydrocarbons. But Friends of the Earth points out that diesel engines produce more nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, black smoke and particles associated with poor urban air quality. FoE says both petrol and diesel can be reformulated to lower emissions, and urges drivers whose cars have a catalytic converter to look for city diesel and petrol, clean diesel and petrol, low-sulphur petrol, ultra-low-sulphur diesel and low benzene petrol. These make no difference to a car's performance, and should become cheaper from next March thanks to the cuts announced in the pre-Budget report.</p> <p>Other ways to cut fuel consumption include:</p> <p>\u0095 Remove roof racks when not in use. They cut fuel economy by 10 per cent even empty.</p> <p>\u0095 Keep tyres at the correct pressure: under-inflated tyres cut efficiency by a mile a gallon.</p> <p>\u0095 Drive more slowly. Doing 80 or 85 mph increases your costs by 25p per10 miles.</p> <p>\u0095 Try not to use air conditioning. It eats petrol at up to 7 per cent more than normal.</p>",

Under these rules people with personal pensions and retirement annuity contracts can carry forward up to six years of unused pension contributions.

Peter Smith of adviser Hill Martin says: 'A lot depends on the client's normal expenditure on pensions and their available cash. Is it a good idea to take out a mortgage to do it?

Leaflet IR78 - in tax offices, on <a href=\"http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk\">www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk</a> or through the Revenue's orderline on 0645 000 404 - explains how this is done. </p> <p>The amount you can pay to a personal pension depends on your age and how much you earn. A 37-year old with net relevant earnings (income less certain deductions) of \u00a320,000 could pay a maximum of 20 per cent of that income - \u00a34,000 - into a personal pension. If that 37-year old had only made \u00a31,000 of contributions, he could now pay in another \u00a33,000 and get the tax relief. </p> <p>If you decide to go ahead, contact the Inland Revenue and fill in form PP43 (or simply 43 if you have a retirement annuity contract). Although it could be argued that you do not have to send in proof that you have made the pension payment, you'll make life easier by enclosing copies of the letter you wrote to the pension provider, the cheque you sent or their receipt. </p> <p>'If you don't send in the documentation, you are asking for an inquiry,' says tax specialist Richard Murphy.

'A lot of policies taken out before 5 April will generate very fat commission. If you are making a large single contribu tion, make sure the charges are low.' </p> <p>There is nothing to stop someone starting a new low-charging policy if they think they will be better off there than paying into a plan that takes off 5 per cent or more in initial charges.

      "body": "<p>Up to 10,000 unhappily married middle class couples each year are expected to take advantage of a change in the law that will allow them for the first time to share out pension funds . </p> <p>The change applies where one member of a Middle- England couple - perhaps a bank manager, police officer or civil servant - is in an occupational scheme. </p> <p>When this part of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act takes effect, on 1 December, partners will be able to split the funds in the same way as they now divide shareholdings, book collections and other assets. </p> <p>They can agree any proportions they like for the share-out. Many will go for a 50:50 split. A divorcing wife whose husband's fund is worth \u00a3100,000 could keep her half in his employer's scheme, or take it out and set up her own pension. </p> <p>'This will be attractive to Tony Blair's England - people in their late forties or fifties who have built up a pension fund,' says David Davidson of solicitor Charles Russell and author of Pensions and Marriage Breakdown . </p> <p>'It will help them make a clean-break settlement. It will also help people with very good pension schemes who are working in declining industries.' </p> <p>But pension-sharing is still controversial. Women's campaigners, particularly the group Fairshares, fought hard for this breakthrough, which ensures that women are never left out of divorce settlements, as they were in the past. This used to favour higher-earning husbands at their ex-wives' expense. </p> <p>But the new rules have their own snags: they could be too costly for many people; they will be misunderstood by many divorce professionals; and the outcomes will be unfair in many cases. </p> <p>A similar change in the law - allowing a share of an ex-spouse's pension to be earmarked for the future - has attracted only 1,000 couples since it took effect in 1996. When the scheme member draws a pension, the ex-spouse gets one as well. But the ex-wife gets nothing if her former hus band dies early or postpones taking the pension, and she loses any right to the fund if she remarries. </p> <p>Anyone considering the latest sharing option should first consider simply trying to divide the assets without carving up the pension. If, for example, a couple have \u00a3100,000 in a pension fund and own a clear \u00a3100,000 of the value of their home, the husband could keep the pension, while the wife took on the house. </p> <p>If pension-sharing still seems best, a fair valuation of the fund by the scheme's trustees is crucial. The Divorce Corporation, a specialist firm of pension fund valuers, has seen cases where the wife received only half of what would be fairly due to her under the earmarking rules, because of the valuation. The trustees will assume that the husband will retire at 60 or 65, even if that won't happen. </p> <p>A policeman aged 49, for example, would be assumed to start drawing his pension at 60. In reality, many officers can retire at 50 with very comfortable 'final salary' pension from that age. A wife who accepted a valuation based on retirement at 60 would lose 10 years' potential income. </p> <p>Study your own and your spouse's financial statements carefully. Financial claims are dealt with in parallel to the divorce claim. You will both submit sworn statements of your means, and will be able to put questions to each other and ask for further information. </p> <p>Get of a copy of the rules of your spouse's pension scheme and find out what benefits it has paid so far. If, for instance, a 'final salary' scheme has regularly given pensioners rises above the rate of inflation, you could make a higher claim, as you could reasonably assume that your spouse will get similar increases. Be aware of the difference between 'money purchase' schemes, where the member simply builds up a pot of money; and 'final salary' schemes, where members accumulate only an entitlement to an annual income.) </p> <p>You are best off trying to negotiate your own settlement, but mediation services are available in case of difficulty. You will finally agree a 'pension sharing order' which sets out the percentage split between you and tells the trustees to make the arrangements. </p> <p>You may be forced to move your share out of the scheme. 'Most require ex-spouses to transfer their share to their own scheme,' says Sarah Tier of pension solicitor Sacker &amp; Partners. </p> <p>If this happens, you may need to set up a new personal pension of your own. You will have a choice of many low-fee schemes from April, when the new state-backed 'stakeholder pension' is introduced. Charges will be only 1 per cent a year - considerably lower than on traditional plans. </p> <p>Pension schemes are allowed to charge for the costs of setting up a pension share. Most will follow a list of suggested charges, which is being published by the National Association of Pension Funds. The maximum on the list is\u00a3750, though this is not binding. </p> <p>Sallie Quin of Fairshares says: 'Large and medium-sized schemes won't have a problem, but sharing arrangements could be disproportionately expensive for small employers.' </p> <p>Sharing could apply to several different pension scheme funds if your spouse has more than one fund from previous jobs. The rules can also be applied to personal pensions. </p> <p>Mistakes by professionals can haunt you long after they are made. Divorce solicitors have, in the past, helped women into a poverty- stricken old age by ignoring husbands' pensions. </p> <p>A big effort is being made to educate lawyers about the reform, but most will not be capable of dealing with this issue particularly well. Ensure that your solicitor understands the issue, perhaps by using one recommended by the Solicitors' Family Law Association. It has an accreditation system for divorce solicitors, who understand pensions - but only about 35 out of its 5,000 members are yet accredited. </p> <p>You could benefit from asking an actuary to look at the pension valuation, or get advice on setting up a personal pension. </p> <p>'Don't accept what you are first offered,' says Donna Bradshaw of independent financial adviser Fiona Price &amp; Partners.

      "body": "<p>It's official: we are not being ripped off by supermarkets. The Competition Commission report on supermarkets published last month concluded: 'The industry is broadly competitive and, overall, excessive prices are not being charged nor excessive profits earned.' </p> <p>That may be true of bacon and baked beans, but can the same be said of the supermarkets' financial products? There was certainly no hint of profiteering when Sainsbury and Tesco launched their savings accounts back in 1997. And the attractive rates paid on balances of \u00a31 and upwards put them well ahead of the high street and ensured regular appearances in best-buy tables. But then the new supermarket banks realised that giving consumers such a good deal wasn't making them enough money. </p> <p>Less than a year later they were still offering better deals than the average high-street savings account, but with the introduction of interest-rate tiers and new banks set up by insurers Legal &amp; General, Scottish Widows and Standard Life - and the Safeway-branded accounts operated by Abbey National - they were by no means market leaders any longer. </p> <p>Today, anyone with small amounts to save should steer clear of the accounts offered by supermarkets. Balances of less than \u00a3500 earn a miserly 1.9 per cent with Safeway's Direct Savings account, although savings of between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000 earn a more reasonable 5 per cent. This is marginally better than the 4.85 per cent paid by the Instant Access Savings account from Sainsbury on balances from \u00a31 to \u00a31,000 and by the Tesco Savings account on savings from \u00a31 to \u00a33,000. But it is still less competitive than the 6.25 per cent paid on any size of balance by the Easy Access Tracker from Legal &amp; General Bank (0500 111200). Nationwide FlexAccount customers prepared to do business over the Internet can do even better with Nationwide's e-Savings account (<a href=\"http://www.nationwide.co.uk\">www.nationwide.co.uk</a>), which pays 7 per cent on balances from \u00a31 up to a maximum of \u00a350,000. A minimum deposit of \u00a32,000 earns the same (including 1 per cent introductory bonus) with Abbey's web-based eSaver (<a href=\"http://www.abbeynational.co.uk\">www.abbeynational.co.uk</a>). </p> <p>But while supermarket accounts aren't a particularly attractive option if you have modest savings, it's a different story if you have substantial sums. </p> <p>Provided you have a minimum of \u00a310,000 to set aside and you're prepared to give 60 days' notice of withdrawals, the best rate is from Safeway, which is paying 7.1 per cent (including a bonus of 1 per cent payable until 1 April 2001) on its Postal Notice Account (0800 995995). </p> <p>If you want a no-notice account, the Direct Saver from Sainsbury's Bank (0500 405060) doesn't match the rates paid on the e-savings accounts already mentioned but it does start to approach best-buy status if your savings exceed \u00a325,000. On this size of balance, you'll earn 6.25 per cent (including a 0.25 per cent bonus until March 2001). The rate goes up to 6.5 per cent if you have \u00a3100,000 on deposit. However, with that level of savings, every percentage point counts. You could earn over \u00a3300 more a year (before tax) with the CLIC Direct Easy Access account from Bristol &amp; West (0845 111 0114) and the SimplySave account offered by Birmingham Midshires (0845 602 2828), both of which pay 6.85 per cent. </p> <p>When it comes to tax-free savings, the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, must be feeling a little disappointed that the supermarkets have not done more to promote what he promised would be tax-free savings 'for the many, not just the few'.

This is left to Safeway, whose cash mini Isa, operated by Abbey National, pays 5.95 per cent on balances of \u00a310 rising to 6.35 per cent on \u00a33,000 and 6.65 per cent on balances of \u00a36,000 plus. These are as good as the rates paid by Abbey National on accounts sold under its own name but not as good as the 7.25 per cent paid by smile (<a href=\"http://www.smile.co.uk\">www.smile.co.uk</a>) on Isa savings above \u00a31. </p> <p>If you prefer not to save in cyberspace you can still do better with the Bath building society, which pays 7 per cent on balances over \u00a3500 in its mini cash Isa (01225 423271) or with the Earl Shilton (01455 844422) which pays 7.1 on a mimumun of \u00a31,000. </p> <p>Although they haven't gone down the cash Isa route, both Sainsbury's and Tesco do offer low-charging equity-based Isas.

The Tesco Growth Isa tracks the FTSE All-Share Index, while its Income Isa invests in quality corporate bonds and gilts.

      "bodyText": "It's official: we are not being ripped off by supermarkets. The Competition Commission report on supermarkets published last month concluded: 'The industry is broadly competitive and, overall, excessive prices are not being charged nor excessive profits earned.' That may be true of bacon and baked beans, but can the same be said of the supermarkets' financial products? There was certainly no hint of profiteering when Sainsbury and Tesco launched their savings accounts back in 1997. And the attractive rates paid on balances of \u00a31 and upwards put them well ahead of the high street and ensured regular appearances in best-buy tables. But then the new supermarket banks realised that giving consumers such a good deal wasn't making them enough money. Less than a year later they were still offering better deals than the average high-street savings account, but with the introduction of interest-rate tiers and new banks set up by insurers Legal &amp; General, Scottish Widows and Standard Life - and the Safeway-branded accounts operated by Abbey National - they were by no means market leaders any longer. Today, anyone with small amounts to save should steer clear of the accounts offered by supermarkets. Balances of less than \u00a3500 earn a miserly 1.9 per cent with Safeway's Direct Savings account, although savings of between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000 earn a more reasonable 5 per cent. This is marginally better than the 4.85 per cent paid by the Instant Access Savings account from Sainsbury on balances from \u00a31 to \u00a31,000 and by the Tesco Savings account on savings from \u00a31 to \u00a33,000. But it is still less competitive than the 6.25 per cent paid on any size of balance by the Easy Access Tracker from Legal &amp; General Bank (0500 111200). Nationwide FlexAccount customers prepared to do business over the Internet can do even better with Nationwide's e-Savings account (www.nationwide.co.uk), which pays 7 per cent on balances from \u00a31 up to a maximum of \u00a350,000. A minimum deposit of \u00a32,000 earns the same (including 1 per cent introductory bonus) with Abbey's web-based eSaver (www.abbeynational.co.uk). But while supermarket accounts aren't a particularly attractive option if you have modest savings, it's a different story if you have substantial sums. Provided you have a minimum of \u00a310,000 to set aside and you're prepared to give 60 days' notice of withdrawals, the best rate is from Safeway, which is paying 7.1 per cent (including a bonus of 1 per cent payable until 1 April 2001) on its Postal Notice Account (0800 995995). If you want a no-notice account, the Direct Saver from Sainsbury's Bank (0500 405060) doesn't match the rates paid on the e-savings accounts already mentioned but it does start to approach best-buy status if your savings exceed \u00a325,000. On this size of balance, you'll earn 6.25 per cent (including a 0.25 per cent bonus until March 2001). The rate goes up to 6.5 per cent if you have \u00a3100,000 on deposit. However, with that level of savings, every percentage point counts. You could earn over \u00a3300 more a year (before tax) with the CLIC Direct Easy Access account from Bristol &amp; West (0845 111 0114) and the SimplySave account offered by Birmingham Midshires (0845 602 2828), both of which pay 6.85 per cent.

      "body": "<p>Sainsbury's and Tesco may no longer offer savers market-leading rates, but do they - and some of the other supermarkets - give a good deal to borrowers? </p> <p>The main attraction for customers of Budgens, Morrisons, Sainsbury and Tesco is that taking out your favourite supermarket's credit card increases the number of loyalty points you earn if you use the card to pay for your shopping. </p> <p>This is also true of the Advantage Visa card recently issued by their high-street rival in toiletries and drugs, Boots. </p> <p>But for people running a debt, there is no attraction in a Budgens card, since it offers no introductory incentives and standard rates (see table on page 4) that are higher than those charged by some high street banks. </p> <p>The Morrisons credit card does at least offer better rates to new customers, but they could hardly be described as competitive. </p> <p>Only Boots can match the zero per cent that is charged on new purchases by Capital One Bank (0800 952 5252) and Egg (<a href=\"http://www.egg.com\">www.egg.com</a>). But for debt transfers, the cards from Boots, Sainsbury and Tesco offer better rates than the 7.9 per cent charged by Capital One. </p> <p>The Boots Advantage Visa, even beats the 2.5 per cent charged by Egg (which 'powers' the Boots card) for balances transferred within six months of the card being issued.

The main attraction for customers of Budgens, Morrisons, Sainsbury and Tesco is that taking out your favourite supermarket's credit card increases the number of loyalty points you earn if you use the card to pay for your shopping. This is also true of the Advantage Visa card recently issued by their high-street rival in toiletries and drugs, Boots. But for people running a debt, there is no attraction in a Budgens card, since it offers no introductory incentives and standard rates (see table on page 4) that are higher than those charged by some high street banks. The Morrisons credit card does at least offer better rates to new customers, but they could hardly be described as competitive. Only Boots can match the zero per cent that is charged on new purchases by Capital One Bank (0800 952 5252) and Egg (www.egg.com). But for debt transfers, the cards from Boots, Sainsbury and Tesco offer better rates than the 7.9 per cent charged by Capital One. The Boots Advantage Visa, even beats the 2.5 per cent charged by Egg (which 'powers' the Boots card) for balances transferred within six months of the card being issued. Sainsbury's introductory rate of 7.5 per cent for cash withdrawals looks good compared with other supermarket cards - and it's likely to be cheaper than withdrawing cash on a bank overdraft. But even lower teaser rates for cash are available from the Halifax (0800 389 6000), Lombard Direct (0800 215 000) and Nationwide (0500 302 011).

Sainsbury's Mortgage Payment Sure policy costs\u00a36.01 a month for every \u00a3100 of cover, so insuring a regular mortgage payment of \u00a3500 would add \u00a330.05 to your monthly outgoings. This compares with a market average of \u00a35.50 per \u00a3100 of cover, and is one-and-a- half times as much as the same cover from the new entrant, Marks &amp; Spencer (0800 363 448), which charges \u00a34.

But although the company still offers cheaper policies than most high-street lenders, it can't quite keep up with the highly competitive premiums from Tesco. According to Moneyfacts Life and Pensions, for a 35-year-old non-smoking man wanting \u00a3100,000 of cover over 20 years the \u00a39.74 a month he would pay Tesco (0845 845 1477) is the lowest premium on the market. A non-smoking woman of the same age would pay Tesco \u00a38.82, which is less than the \u00a39.55 Marks &amp; Spencer (0800 363 422) charges but not quite as good as the \u00a38.40 premium on offer from Scottish Widows (0345 678 910). However, in charging a man \u00a318.56 and a woman \u00a314.45, Tesco is not as good value for 35-year-old smokers, who would do better turning to Equitable Life (0870 900 8020), where he and she pay \u00a313.55 and \u00a310.17 respectively. </p> <p><strong> Home and contents</strong> </p> <p> Sainsbury's doesn't stock life insurance, but in common with Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco, it does sell both buildings and house contents insurance. It is impossible to say whether they will definitely give a good deal because so much depends on personal circumstances. But the quotes these retailers supplied to Cash - which were compared with figures from independent broker Charcol (0800 939 393) - suggest that it would be worth adding them to your list of companies to contact next time your house insur ance comes up for renewal. </p> <p>Quotes were based on a policy without accidental damage or all-risks cover for a couple of 40-year-old teachers living in a three-bedroom turn-of-the-century terraced house with a rebuilding cost of \u00a3100,000 and contents worth \u00a330,000. Figures were given for three different postcodes and assume the house is fitted with British Standard door and window locks but no burglar alarm. </p> <p>In all postcodes, Tesco (0845 300 6600) gave the lowest quote for buildings insurance. Sainsbury's (0500 301 030) was cheapest for contents at the medium-risk address but Charcol gave the most competitive contents quotes for the low- and high-risk postcodes. </p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer didn't do that well on price but is worth investigating for what it describes as its market-beating unlimited cover. Of most interest is the company's claim that, with the exception of personal money, the policy does not place a maximum on what it will pay out in the event of a claim - on condition that you tell M&amp;S about any single item worth \u00a34,000 or more when you apply for the insurance (0800 389 9988 or go to <a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/financialservices\">www.marksandspencer.com</a>). </p> <p><strong> Car</strong> </p> <p> It's also worth getting a quote from Tesco if it's time to renew your car insurance (0845 300 4400 or go to <a href=\"http://www.tesco.com/finance\">www.tesco.com/finance</a>). Although it is not always competitive, it did provide some of the lowest premiums for a notional 1998 Ford Mondeo driven by a 40-year-old couple with six claim-free years. </p> <p> <strong> Travel</strong> </p> <p> Asda, Boots, Sainsbury's and Tesco are right to claim that their travel insurance is cheaper than travel agents and tour operators. But they charge maybe twice as much as specialist travel insurers such as Direct Travel (01903 812345 or go to <a href=\"http://www.direct-travel.co.uk\">www.direct-travel.co.uk</a>), Options (0870 848 00870), TravelPlan Direct (0800 018 8747) and Worldwide Travel (01892 833 338), all of which featured as best buys in a recent survey by Which? magazine. </p> <p>The exception to this is the Asda for Travel annual worldwide policy from Asda (08000 646688 or go to <a href=\"http://www.asdafortravel.com\">www.asdafortravel.com</a>). The prices of \u00a357.95 for a single adult, \u00a374.95 for a single parent, \u00a378.95 for a couple and \u00a391.95 for a family compare favourably with policies from independent insurers. Asda's price is particularly good value if you are over 65. Boots doubles the premium for this age group, while Sainsbury's and Tesco add an age-related loading that depends on individual circumstances. Asda does not charge extra until age 70. </p> <p><strong> Pets</strong> </p> <p> You buy pet food from supermarkets, so why not pet insurance? If you want this kind of cover (which helps only with unexpected vet's bills, not routine treatment), Tesco's rates, which start at \u00a34 a month for cats and \u00a37 for dogs, cost less than the \u00a36.99 and \u00a38.99 charged by Sainsbury's. </p> <p>Tesco (0845 300 2200) also gives slightly better cover. An alternative, which costs slightly more than Tesco for cats but less for dogs, is to take out an RSPCA Pet Insurance policy (0870 444 3127 or <a href=\"http://www.rspca.org.uk\">www.rspca.org.uk</a>).

      "body": "<p>From the amount of money spent on advertising financial websites, you could be forgiven for thinking it was the most popular way of conducting your financial transactions. </p> <p>But new research has produced mixed messages about the state of internet banking. While online bank account holders have doubled in the past year, only a quarter of customers are happy with the service. </p> <p>Cahoot, Abbey National's standalone internet operation, has attracted just 70,000 customers so far, and rival Egg recently saw a large chunk of money disappear from its savings account when it cut interest rates. </p> <p>Online share dealing also appears not to be living up to its early promise. Despite an initial explosion in online share dealing and lots of hype, online execution-only trades now account for just a quarter of such deals. </p> <p>So are we still in love with the net? Or is the affair over already? Chris Rawlins, director of the British Bankers' Association (BBA), believes internet banking has not peaked yet. </p> <p>By the end of 2000, a third of EU households will have access to the internet, rising to 55 per cent in three years, according to figures from Schroder Salomon Smith Barney - and that's just on PCs. With more platforms coming on the scene, such as Wap phones and interactive TV, even more people will have access to the web. </p> <p>BBA believes the range of services offered by internet banks, and the low cost of using those services, will also boost the popularity of these banks. A Mori poll predicts that 30 per cent of bank customers will be using the internet by 2003. </p> <p>But in the meantime BBA's Rawlins says some operations are suffering from the race to get something - anything - on the net as soon as possible. And dealing with new technology causes teething problems. The internet has been dubbed the 'world wide wait', because of protracted download times. </p> <p>However, the industry is confident it can overcome these problems. Rawlins says the next challenge is to exploit the net to its full extent. 'Banks have to offer something different, as the Woolwich has, if they want \"stickability\", or the reten tion of customers.' He singles out the Woolwich for its open plan account, which allows customers to put money in virtual 'jam jars' so that they can move it around as they please. </p> <p>Cahoot marketing director Tim Sawyer agrees that the internet is ultimately about service: 'The price is just an incentive to join.' </p> <p>He stresses that the internet is a much more convenient way of banking than writing letters or making phone calls. Sawyer points to Cahoot's credit card facility as an example of where the internet comes into its own. Customers can 'design' a card by deciding whether they want to pay a monthly fee or an interest rate. Next on the horizon is a 'highly flexible' unsecured loan. </p> <p>But Sawyer agrees with Rawlins that the internet has come out of its honeymoon period. He says: 'A lot of the froth has been blown away. But the fact remains that the internet is a cost-effective way of banking, therefore it will see steady growth. It is a question of how quickly it will grow rather than if.' </p> <p>A new system being piloted by the Association for Payment Clearing Services should encourage growth. Widely available at the end of next year, it will make it easier to transfer your bank details from one account to another using electronic rather than paper means. </p> <p>As for other future trends, Egg marketing director Andrew Firth says he will be interested to see whether customers stick with their original banks, who tend to offer traditional products online, or transfer to a brand such as Egg, which 'tries to offer something different'. He puts Egg's loss of funds from its savings account - \u00a3443m since flotation - down to the the antics of so-called silver surfers, senior citizens who have become adept at seeking out the best online deals. Egg is keen to point out that it only lost 20,000 out of 2 million customers. They just happened to take some bumper balances with them. </p> <p>Firth sees the growth of internet banking continuing unabated as people become accustomed to internet culture and further distribution channels open up. </p> <p>However, the experts agree that people will not forsake their phones entirely. They rely on call centres to deal with problems and give out more detailed information. The online share dealing industry has also not managed to extricate people from their phones. </p> <p>Stocktrade spokesman Carolyn Abbott says the majority of its clients are still happier dealing over the phone. Many online dealers tend to run a telephone service in tandem to their internet offering. </p> <p>The Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers says a quarter of execution-only trades are now done online. This may not sound much, but it is up from one in a thousand in 1998. </p> <p>Analyst Compeer says: 'It has been a relatively flat quarter, but the market has been static generally. We believe that growth will continue - but steadily. We won't experience the explosion that was felt at the beginning of the year.' </p> <p>It says online share dealing will continue to grow despite limiting factors such as stamp duty, because it is cheaper than using the phone, and there are easy links to research and other information. The market will also benefit from the increase in prosperity and growing awareness of the need for self-provision.</p>",

      "bodyText": "From the amount of money spent on advertising financial websites, you could be forgiven for thinking it was the most popular way of conducting your financial transactions. But new research has produced mixed messages about the state of internet banking. While online bank account holders have doubled in the past year, only a quarter of customers are happy with the service. Cahoot, Abbey National's standalone internet operation, has attracted just 70,000 customers so far, and rival Egg recently saw a large chunk of money disappear from its savings account when it cut interest rates. Online share dealing also appears not to be living up to its early promise. Despite an initial explosion in online share dealing and lots of hype, online execution-only trades now account for just a quarter of such deals. So are we still in love with the net? Or is the affair over already? Chris Rawlins, director of the British Bankers' Association (BBA), believes internet banking has not peaked yet. By the end of 2000, a third of EU households will have access to the internet, rising to 55 per cent in three years, according to figures from Schroder Salomon Smith Barney - and that's just on PCs. With more platforms coming on the scene, such as Wap phones and interactive TV, even more people will have access to the web. BBA believes the range of services offered by internet banks, and the low cost of using those services, will also boost the popularity of these banks. A Mori poll predicts that 30 per cent of bank customers will be using the internet by 2003. But in the meantime BBA's Rawlins says some operations are suffering from the race to get something - anything - on the net as soon as possible. And dealing with new technology causes teething problems. The internet has been dubbed the 'world wide wait', because of protracted download times. However, the industry is confident it can overcome these problems. Rawlins says the next challenge is to exploit the net to its full extent. 'Banks have to offer something different, as the Woolwich has, if they want \"stickability\", or the reten tion of customers.' He singles out the Woolwich for its open plan account, which allows customers to put money in virtual 'jam jars' so that they can move it around as they please. Cahoot marketing director Tim Sawyer agrees that the internet is ultimately about service: 'The price is just an incentive to join.' He stresses that the internet is a much more convenient way of banking than writing letters or making phone calls. Sawyer points to Cahoot's credit card facility as an example of where the internet comes into its own. Customers can 'design' a card by deciding whether they want to pay a monthly fee or an interest rate. Next on the horizon is a 'highly flexible' unsecured loan. But Sawyer agrees with Rawlins that the internet has come out of its honeymoon period. He says: 'A lot of the froth has been blown away. But the fact remains that the internet is a cost-effective way of banking, therefore it will see steady growth. It is a question of how quickly it will grow rather than if.' A new system being piloted by the Association for Payment Clearing Services should encourage growth. Widely available at the end of next year, it will make it easier to transfer your bank details from one account to another using electronic rather than paper means. As for other future trends, Egg marketing director Andrew Firth says he will be interested to see whether customers stick with their original banks, who tend to offer traditional products online, or transfer to a brand such as Egg, which 'tries to offer something different'. He puts Egg's loss of funds from its savings account - \u00a3443m since flotation - down to the the antics of so-called silver surfers, senior citizens who have become adept at seeking out the best online deals. Egg is keen to point out that it only lost 20,000 out of 2 million customers. They just happened to take some bumper balances with them. Firth sees the growth of internet banking continuing unabated as people become accustomed to internet culture and further distribution channels open up. However, the experts agree that people will not forsake their phones entirely. They rely on call centres to deal with problems and give out more detailed information. The online share dealing industry has also not managed to extricate people from their phones. Stocktrade spokesman Carolyn Abbott says the majority of its clients are still happier dealing over the phone. Many online dealers tend to run a telephone service in tandem to their internet offering. The Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers says a quarter of execution-only trades are now done online. This may not sound much, but it is up from one in a thousand in 1998. Analyst Compeer says: 'It has been a relatively flat quarter, but the market has been static generally. We believe that growth will continue - but steadily. We won't experience the explosion that was felt at the beginning of the year.' It says online share dealing will continue to grow despite limiting factors such as stamp duty, because it is cheaper than using the phone, and there are easy links to research and other information. The market will also benefit from the increase in prosperity and growing awareness of the need for self-provision.",
