Subs: Sheron, Hristov, Jones, Eaden, Thomas. </p> <p><strong>Ipswich</strong>: R. Wright, Croft, McGreal, Mowbray, Venus, Clapham, Holland, Magilton, J. Wright, Johnson, Stewart. Subs: Wilnis, Naylor, Brown, Reuser, Branagan. </p> <p>Referee: T Heilbron (Newton Aycliffe)</p> <p><strong>1 minute</strong>: Ipswich kick-off the last play-off final under the Twin Towers. Immediately they pump the ball forward and Johnson goes in heavily on Barnsley keeper, Miller fouling him in the process. Johnson falls hard but he looks OK.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Ipswich are pressing Barnsley back. By contrast Barnsley look nervous and Miller kicks a goal kick straight into touch.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> GOAL! Hignett drifts into space and lets fly with an absolute screamer from 32 yards. The ball crashes against the bar, hits Wright's arm and goes in. Wright is slightly off his line but he has no chance with the goal. </p> <p><strong>8</strong> Barnsley look full of confidence now. Hignett is finding space and Tinkler is winning the tackles in midfield.</p> <p><strong>9</strong> Ipswich have their first chance of the match. The ball drops to Venus 20 yards out but he pulls his shot wide of the post.</p> <p><strong>12</strong> Ipswich seem to have recovered from their shaky spell after the goal. Croft tackles Hignett at half-way and storms down the line. But his cross is headed clear.</p> <p><strong>14</strong> Dyer is looking dangerous every time he gets the ball. The ball drops to Shipperley about 30 yards out. Nobody tackles him and he fires in a low shot just inside the post which Wright comfortably saves.</p> <p><strong>16</strong> Now it's Ipswich's turn to attack. Twice they play lovely passing moves only for the final ball into the box to let them down. The game is already looking like it could be another classic play-off final.</p> <p><strong>18</strong> Tinkler is tackled by J. Wright and goes down with a toe problem. He needs treatment. Chettle also injured after a clash of heads but after a quick dab of the sponge he looks OK. </p> <p><strong>20</strong> Play restarts. Tinkler is back on. The action is now end to end. Miller plucks a difficult cross out of thin air, and immediately releases the ball. It's quickly played through to Dyer, who looks like he could be in until he's tackled at the last second.</p> <p><strong>22</strong> Johnson is substituted for Ipswich with a calf injury. He obviously hasn't recovered from his silly challenge on Miller in the first minute. Naylor replaces him.</p> <p><strong>25</strong> A great passage of Barnsley passing play stretches Ipswich and when ball is played through to Hignett about 25 yards out nobody is near him. He has time to look up before trying a curler which is only narrowly wide of the post - with Wright beaten.</p> <p><strong>27</strong> The ball drops to Holland 20 yards out. His fierce shot is blocked by Chettle. Ipswich get a corner. </p> <p><strong>28</strong> GOAL! From the corner the ball is played to Magilton. He crosses it in to the back post where it is headed powerfully home by 36-year-old Tony Mowbray in his first appearance at Wembley. Miller gets a hand on it but he can't keep it out.</p> <p><strong>31</strong> Ipswich have the initiative and get their third corner in three minutes. The ball drops to Magilton but his cross is blocked. Ipswich get another corner. </p> <p><strong>33</strong> Ipswich storm forward. The ball is played via Naylor to Holland and he's clean through in a central position about 20 yards out. But his shot is straight at the keeper and Brown desperately clears.</p> <p><strong>35</strong> It's all Ipswich at the moment. They are playing all the football and doing all the attacking. Barnsley are encamped in their half. Is a second goal imminent? </p> <p><strong>37</strong> Naylor, who has looked sharp since he's come on, runs down the left and fires a low cross which is well taken by Miller. </p> <p><strong>39</strong> Ipswich get yet another corner when Naylor's shot is blocked by Appleby. But Magilton's kick is easily cleared and Barnsley play the ball back to Miller to get a rest.</p> <p><strong>41</strong> Barnsley at last venture into Ipswich's half and earn a free-kick on the on touchline about 35 yards out when Dyer is fouled. But Barnard's cross is well taken by Wright.</p> <p><strong>44</strong> Magilton again finds space and glides a cross onto the head of Holland. But is header is tame and goes well wide.</p> <p><strong>45</strong> PENALTY!!! Wright brings Hignett down. It's a needless challenge - Hignett is going to get the ball but it's to the side and there's no real danger. Darren Barnard steps up to take it.... </p> <p><strong>45</strong> AND IT'S SAVED!!! Bernard fires the shot to Wright's right, but it's too close to the keeper and Wright pushes it away.</p> <p>HALF TIME</p> <p><strong>48</strong> After a scrappy opening couple of minutes, Dyer is released out wide by Barnard. He holds the ball up well and tries to return the pass but the ball is intercepted.</p> <p><strong> 49</strong> The game erupts into life again. First Holland shoots wide after Magilton's cross is headed down by Naylor. Then Barnsley break, and Dyer and Hignett exchange a one-two. But Dyer can only dribble a shot from Hignett's well judged dink straight into Wright's arms.</p> <p><strong>51</strong> GOAL! Ipswich are ahead. A long ball is flicked on by Stewart straight into Naylor's path. He waits for Miller to come before deftly flicking it past him from 15 yards. </p> <p><strong>52</strong> Naylor takes his top off in celebration and is booked.</p> <p><strong>55</strong> Ipswich are now completely dominant. Once again the ball breaks to the substitute Naylor, who is having a storming game. He scampers down the line and fires in a low cross. For some reason Brown makes a pigs ear of clearing it, but J.Wright hits his shot wide.</p> <p><strong>57</strong>GOAL!!! Ipswich are 3-1 ahead. Great work again from Naylor, who lays it out wide. Clapham immediately whips in a pin-point cross to Stewart who gets ahead of two defenders to smash an unstoppable header home from 8 yards.</p> <p><strong>59</strong> Barnsley almost pull one back when a long ball is pumped through to Dyer. But his overhead kick flashes just wide.</p> <p><strong>60</strong> Barnsley substitution: Thomas replaces the ineffectual Tinkler. </p> <p><strong>62</strong> Ipswich almost score again when another Magilton corner is met by Mowbray. But his header - from only just outside the six-yard box - goes narrowly wide. Could they rue all these missed chances?</p> <p><strong>64</strong> Barnsley substitution: Hristov replaces Dyer, who can consider himself slightly unlucky. He's tried hard and worked his socks off.</p> <p><strong>66</strong> Hristov almost makes an immediate impact, breaking into the penalty area and getting set to release a shot. But Mowbray makes a superb tackle. </p> <p><strong>69</strong> Barnard drifts into space about 30 yards out and gets the ball played through. He looks up and fizzes in a smart left-footed shot which goes just wide. It's the first sign of attacking life for the South Yorkshire team for the past ten minutes.</p> <p><strong>71</strong> Barnsley subsititution: Eaden replaces Curtis. </p> <p><strong>72</strong> Magilton is fouled just outside the box. It's about 22 yards out and slightly right of the goal. But Venus's low shot crashes off the wall and Barnsley clear.</p> <p><strong>74</strong> Ipswich nearly go 4-1 ahead when Mowbray's long ball finds Naylor completely clear. He controls it awkwardly and tries to loop it over Miller - but only succeeds in scooping it straight into his hands.</p> <p><strong>77</strong> A superb four pass move opens up the Ipswich defence and Shipperley has a great shooting chance about 20 yards out. But his snap shot is too close to Wright.</p> <p><strong>77</strong> ANOTHER BARNSLEY PENALTY! The ball is played long to Thomas. But as the former Palace man tries to scoop it over Mowbray's head, he is caught by the Ipswich defender's trailing leg. Hignett runs up to take it...</p> <p><strong>78</strong> AND HE SCORES!!! Hignett dispatches his shot right into the top corner, to set up an enthralling last 12 minutes! Barnsley are back in it!</p> <p><strong>80</strong> Ipswich, who have looked so confident for the entire second half are now looking decidedly edgy. And Barnsley are throwing everybody forward. Hignett has a shot blocked but Dave Bassett's men are now encamped in the Ipswich half - and are unlucky not to score when Nicky Eaden's cross flashes across the six yard box but nobody can get a foot onto it.</p> <p><strong>83</strong> Ipswich substitution: Reuser replaces Stewart </p> <p><strong>84</strong> What a save!!! Richard Wright stops Hristov's point-blank header to keep Barnsley out. Hristov was only about eight yards out, in a central position, but he aimed his header much too close to Wright.</p> <p><strong>86</strong> Barnsley get a free kick on the angle of the box. The ball is played in by Barnard and it pinballs around for about ten seconds before Wright manages to catch it. Ipswich look on the ropes - but do Barnsley have enought time to take advantage? </p> <p><strong>88</strong> Ipswich have a penalty appeal turned down when Reuser falls down in the box.</p> <p><strong>89</strong> Ipswich substitution: There's a delay in the play when Jermaine Wright goes down injured. The Barnsley fans are booing - they think it's time wasting, but Wright is replaced by Wilnis.</p> <p><strong>90</strong> IPSWICH ARE 4-2 AHEAD!!! Barnsley are throwing everybody forward but when they lose it midfield, the ball is passed through to Reuser. He runs for about 50 yards, out-pacing the despairing Brown before drilling it high into the top corner. Ipswich must be in the Premiership now! </p> <p><strong>95</strong> FULL TIME - Ipswich are in the Premiership after yet another superb Wembley play-off final.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Jeff Noon's stage adaptation of his award-winning sci-fi novel is not always coherent, is not helped by the fact that it is often inaudible, and, at almost three hours, is a little self-indulgent. But it is also a stylish and very watchable slice of youth culture theatre that has all the dry ice, bright lights, big sounds and clubbing atmosphere you associate with this kind of theatre, plus a strong narrative and characters with real inner lives. </p> <p>In a Manchester of the future where pure humans live uneasily side by side with dog people and half-human, half-robot types, the Stash riders are a group of friends, led by the manipulative, dishonest, bullying Beetle, whose idea of a good time is to get \"all feathered up\". One lick of a feather, some of which are so dangerous they have been made illegal, and you are transported to another consciousness, a dreamworld known at its most extreme as the Vurt, where the Gamecat rules and the game can be a peach or turn really nasty. Des, sister and more to the fragile, damaged Scribble, took a curious yellow feather and never came back, trapped forever in her dreams in the Vurt. The friends, meanwhile, are left with an alien thing in her place, a Vurt creature that they lug about with them. </p> <p>Scribble's attempts to retrieve Des from the Vurt form the backbone of a story that has an edgy, wired feel, and that succeeds in creating a tangible sense of real and alternate worlds, both equally weird. The whole piece is also touched by an ineffable sadness, a feeling of innocence lost. </p> <p>Noon's play captures all the shimmery, shivery excitement of drugs and altered states, but also the undercurrent of violence, and points up the emptiness of a life lived constantly somewhere else. Liam Steele's production is at times more show than substance, but it never fails to provide that adrenalin rush of excitement.</p> <p>\u0095 To June 17. Box office: 0161 274 0600.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jeff Noon's stage adaptation of his award-winning sci-fi novel is not always coherent, is not helped by the fact that it is often inaudible, and, at almost three hours, is a little self-indulgent. But it is also a stylish and very watchable slice of youth culture theatre that has all the dry ice, bright lights, big sounds and clubbing atmosphere you associate with this kind of theatre, plus a strong narrative and characters with real inner lives. In a Manchester of the future where pure humans live uneasily side by side with dog people and half-human, half-robot types, the Stash riders are a group of friends, led by the manipulative, dishonest, bullying Beetle, whose idea of a good time is to get \"all feathered up\". One lick of a feather, some of which are so dangerous they have been made illegal, and you are transported to another consciousness, a dreamworld known at its most extreme as the Vurt, where the Gamecat rules and the game can be a peach or turn really nasty. Des, sister and more to the fragile, damaged Scribble, took a curious yellow feather and never came back, trapped forever in her dreams in the Vurt. The friends, meanwhile, are left with an alien thing in her place, a Vurt creature that they lug about with them. Scribble's attempts to retrieve Des from the Vurt form the backbone of a story that has an edgy, wired feel, and that succeeds in creating a tangible sense of real and alternate worlds, both equally weird. The whole piece is also touched by an ineffable sadness, a feeling of innocence lost. Noon's play captures all the shimmery, shivery excitement of drugs and altered states, but also the undercurrent of violence, and points up the emptiness of a life lived constantly somewhere else. Liam Steele's production is at times more show than substance, but it never fails to provide that adrenalin rush of excitement. \u0095 To June 17. Box office: 0161 274 0600.",

One in eight full-time workers say they spend no time at all on the daily commute, suggesting that a sizeable proportion are now teleworking from home. Let's hope they are not watching Richard and Judy instead.",

Keen to demonstrate that we British yield nothing to the Americans when it comes to showbiz, the organisers had assembled a smorgasbord of talent which must have left the guest thanking her lucky stars that she upped sticks to California years ago. Over there she would probably have had Julia Roberts, Tom Cruise and the Pope. Here, she was confronted with the ever-grinning Marti Pellow, Jamiroquai's Jay Kay wearing a dinner suit, Martine McCutcheon in a ballgown and some Euroschlock from Bocelli. David Frost, co-compering with Stephen Fry, has the instinctive comic timing of a European committee on tax harmonisation. Not that there wasn't some solid-gold talent on offer. Tony Bennett slid smoothly through a couple of numbers with the Ralph Sharon Trio, while John Barry appeared late to prod the band through a selection of his greatest movie soundtracks. Reba McEntire sang My Secret Love (cunning choice, given that this was a benefit for Liz's Aids foundation) with style, radically different from the sentimentality of her own concerts. Rumours of a performance by Michael Jackson were unfounded, but, looking like a transsexual geisha, he stood onstage with her after she'd delivered her closing plea for better, cheaper healthcare for Aids victims. A disorientatingly bizarre occasion.",

Outward Bound has been taking in apprentices since the 1940s when it was discovered that older seamen tended to survive war experiences over their younger counterparts, largely because of mental fortitude.

We'll assess what the problem is in the work environment and then give them parallel tasks to do in the field.\" </p> <p>But not all team-building activities need to take place in a gale-force wind on top of a remote mountain.

West Indies soon took wickets in Pakistan's second innings but the tourists recovered from 3 for two to lead by 134 with an hour to play, with six wickets in hand.</p> <p>Wasim, who will be 34 in a week, took six for 61, his twenty-third Test haul of five or more wickets. He bowled unchanged from the Viv Richards Pavilion end throughout the morning session, his spell of 11 overs costing just 18 runs.</p> <p>It was his long-time partner, Waqar Younis, who made the breakthrough, removing West Indies captain Jimmy Adams on his overnight score of 60. Adams and Shivnarine Chanderpaul had built a solid platform for West Indian ascendancy on day two. Their fourth-wicket stand was worth 134 when Adams was leg before.</p> <p>Wasim then took over as he swung the second new ball both ways. Teenager Ramnaresh Sarwan had made 10 when he fell in similar fashion to his skipper, caught in front playing back to an inswinger. In Wasim's next over, wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs continued his lean run, adjudged leg before to a yorker for a duck.</p> <p>Chanderpaul advanced his overnight 68 to 89 before, in sight of his third Test century, he too was undone by Wasim, bowled an inswinging full toss. Next, Wasim removed fast bowlers Franklyn Rose and Curtly Ambrose to give Pakistan the chance of a slender lead. Rose slogged his way to 15 with two fours before he top-edged a hook to fine leg, while Ambrose sliced a drive to cover point. Last-wicket pair Reon King and Courtney Walsh managed to secure the lead, but it had been Pakistan's morning with six West Indian wickets falling for the addition of only 58 runs.</p> <p>Wasim then wrapped up the West Indies innings when he bowled King with his second ball after lunch.</p> <p>West Indies hit back with quick wickets at the start of the Pakistan second innings, Walsh and Ambrose reducing the visitors to three for two. The series is level, 0-0.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wasim Akram made light of being implicated in the match-fixing scandal by the Qayyum Report when he took five wickets in the space of 22 balls for one run on the third day of the deciding third Test against West Indies. Pakistan's left-arm quick bowler shattered West Indies' hopes of a substantial first- innings lead as he reduced them from 214 for three overnight to 273 all out, a lead of just four runs. West Indies soon took wickets in Pakistan's second innings but the tourists recovered from 3 for two to lead by 134 with an hour to play, with six wickets in hand. Wasim, who will be 34 in a week, took six for 61, his twenty-third Test haul of five or more wickets. He bowled unchanged from the Viv Richards Pavilion end throughout the morning session, his spell of 11 overs costing just 18 runs. It was his long-time partner, Waqar Younis, who made the breakthrough, removing West Indies captain Jimmy Adams on his overnight score of 60. Adams and Shivnarine Chanderpaul had built a solid platform for West Indian ascendancy on day two. Their fourth-wicket stand was worth 134 when Adams was leg before. Wasim then took over as he swung the second new ball both ways. Teenager Ramnaresh Sarwan had made 10 when he fell in similar fashion to his skipper, caught in front playing back to an inswinger. In Wasim's next over, wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs continued his lean run, adjudged leg before to a yorker for a duck. Chanderpaul advanced his overnight 68 to 89 before, in sight of his third Test century, he too was undone by Wasim, bowled an inswinging full toss. Next, Wasim removed fast bowlers Franklyn Rose and Curtly Ambrose to give Pakistan the chance of a slender lead. Rose slogged his way to 15 with two fours before he top-edged a hook to fine leg, while Ambrose sliced a drive to cover point. Last-wicket pair Reon King and Courtney Walsh managed to secure the lead, but it had been Pakistan's morning with six West Indian wickets falling for the addition of only 58 runs. Wasim then wrapped up the West Indies innings when he bowled King with his second ball after lunch. West Indies hit back with quick wickets at the start of the Pakistan second innings, Walsh and Ambrose reducing the visitors to three for two. The series is level, 0-0.",

      "body": "<p>So many counties championed the return of the Benson and Hedges Cup; they must wonder whether this was worthwhile. This 'summer's' rains have coincided precisely with the advent of a B&amp;H match. At Cardiff, where no play was possible until 4pm yesterday, Glamorgan and Surrey will try to continue today. Meanwhile over the bridge at Bristol in the other semi-final Gloucestershire and Lancashire attempt to dodge the showers today and Monday. </p> <p>When finally play began in a howling gale Glamorgan opted to bat but encountered early problems. Robert Croft,timidly for a pinch-hitter, gave a simple return catch to Alex Tudor, while Matthew Elliott dragged a ball from Martin Bicknall on to his stumps. All the while the clouds were banking up in the background. This is not Mastermind . They may have started but there is no guarantee they will finish. </p> <p>Amid the storms the coaches must decide whether to adopt the Hoddle policy of not practising shoot-outs or to instruct their bowlers to take to the indoor school and aim for those three stumps. If rain prevents sufficient play to produce a result in these matches, the five chosen bowlers have two attempts to hit the stumps in the bowl-out.

      "bodyText": "So many counties championed the return of the Benson and Hedges Cup; they must wonder whether this was worthwhile. This 'summer's' rains have coincided precisely with the advent of a B&amp;H match. At Cardiff, where no play was possible until 4pm yesterday, Glamorgan and Surrey will try to continue today. Meanwhile over the bridge at Bristol in the other semi-final Gloucestershire and Lancashire attempt to dodge the showers today and Monday. When finally play began in a howling gale Glamorgan opted to bat but encountered early problems. Robert Croft,timidly for a pinch-hitter, gave a simple return catch to Alex Tudor, while Matthew Elliott dragged a ball from Martin Bicknall on to his stumps. All the while the clouds were banking up in the background. This is not Mastermind . They may have started but there is no guarantee they will finish. Amid the storms the coaches must decide whether to adopt the Hoddle policy of not practising shoot-outs or to instruct their bowlers to take to the indoor school and aim for those three stumps. If rain prevents sufficient play to produce a result in these matches, the five chosen bowlers have two attempts to hit the stumps in the bowl-out. If the scores are equal after the 10 mandatory deliveries, it's sudden death.

Off the pitch, it is the sight of all-singing, all-dancing fans to whom tribal violence is something inflicted by outsiders on the inhabitants of their rain forests. On the pitch, that all-swaying, all-swerving yellow and green inspires a million misty-eyed memories. </p> <p>Thank God for them yesterday. Because there is something about being around England games at Wembley that can make you want to weep. It is not just the maddeningly orchestrated enthusiasm of a rabble-rousing public-address announcer that makes you feel like you are in the audience for a game show, it is the cloying traffic and public transport system that turns enjoyment into endurance. </p> <p>Due to tube delays, the match kicked off half an hour late. Never, in covering six major championships and countless international matches in between, can this correspondent remember encountering a delayed kick-off abroad. Hooliganism, a creaking infrastructure; England seems determined to sabotage its own World Cup bid, with the decision on the venue for 2006 just over a month away. </p> <p>At least the team provided a shaft of optimism with a goal as the sun came out after a rainstorm - proving that if you don't like the weather in this country, hang around and it will change - by Michael Owen at his predatory best. The weary thought did occur, though, that it may have been England's first mistake.

      "bodyText": "There is something about being around the Brazilians that stimulates even the most jaded footballing palate. Off the pitch, it is the sight of all-singing, all-dancing fans to whom tribal violence is something inflicted by outsiders on the inhabitants of their rain forests. On the pitch, that all-swaying, all-swerving yellow and green inspires a million misty-eyed memories. Thank God for them yesterday. Because there is something about being around England games at Wembley that can make you want to weep. It is not just the maddeningly orchestrated enthusiasm of a rabble-rousing public-address announcer that makes you feel like you are in the audience for a game show, it is the cloying traffic and public transport system that turns enjoyment into endurance. Due to tube delays, the match kicked off half an hour late. Never, in covering six major championships and countless international matches in between, can this correspondent remember encountering a delayed kick-off abroad. Hooliganism, a creaking infrastructure; England seems determined to sabotage its own World Cup bid, with the decision on the venue for 2006 just over a month away. At least the team provided a shaft of optimism with a goal as the sun came out after a rainstorm - proving that if you don't like the weather in this country, hang around and it will change - by Michael Owen at his predatory best. The weary thought did occur, though, that it may have been England's first mistake. Duly on the stroke of half-time came a goal by Franca, who could well be, in the absence of Ronaldo, the NBT (next big thing) of the world game. Kevin Keegan billed the game as a contrast in styles. 'We've got Land Of Hope And Glory . They've got the samba,' he said.

The next corner from the left was speared straight to the unmarked Billy Dodds, who bulleted a header into the net. </p> <p>The fourth goal was an Albertz speciality, a fierce drive from 25 yards against the underside of the bar, the ball dropping at least a foot over the line before bouncing out. </p> <p> <strong> Aberdeen:</strong> Leighton (Winters 2); Whyte, Solberg, Anderson (Belabed 31), McAllister, Bernard, Jess, Rowson, Guntveit, Stavrum, Dow. <strong> Subs not used:</strong> Zerouali. </p> <p><strong> Rangers:</strong> Klos; Reyna, Moore (Porrini 71), Vidmar, Numan, Kanchelskis, Ferguson, Albertz, van Bronckhorst, Wallace (McCann 67), Dodds. <strong> Subs not used:</strong> Tugay. </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> Jim McCluskey (Scotland)</p>",

When it comes to appointing judges it is understood that any knowledge might be a dangerous thing. </p> <p>The most important manifestation of this sea change in perception has come from the evidence given by cricketers to recent inquiries. In 1997, following allegations by Manoj Prabhakar in the Indian magazine Outlook , Justice Chandrachud investigated match fixing. It was held in private and Justice Chandrachud's report was not made public. More than two years later, after Cronje and in the face of much pressure, it was eventually released. It is remarkable for the manner in which the great and good of Indian cricket all speak with one voice. </p> <p><strong> Sachin Tendulkar</strong> : 'I do not believe that the matches are fixed or can be fixed.' </p> <p><strong> Mohammed Azharuddin:</strong> 'I do not think that any match can be fixed.' </p> <p><strong> Nayan Mongia:</strong> 'Matches are not fixed at all.

The only slight variation on the theme came from Ajay Jadeja who argued that 'fixing a match requires a great amount of homogeneity which is not to be found in a pronounced manner in our team. The team is composed of players from different parts of India and they have not much in common between them.' </p> <p> Interesting argument and one that suggests the real reason why England haven't being dragged into the present hubbub. The bookies didn't approach them not because, as previously believed, they thought they were crap, but because they knew they couldn't stand each other and that if you bribed one to throw a match it would only inspire the others to try that little bit harder just to spite him. </p> <p>Given the evidence, it is not surprising that Justice Chandrachud in his windy and unconvincing judgment should pronounce the game as clean as an umpire's coat. At the end, he praised the players who came forward for having 'one common objective, namely to save the fair name of the game called cricket. I accept without hesitation the statements of Mohammed Azharuddin, Ajay Jadeja, Kapil Dev and Ajit Wadekar.' </p> <p>'Without hesitation' - oh dear. If Justice Chandrachud had hesitated until yesterday's revelations in Delhi he might have saved himself some embarrassment. </p> <p>It is now clear that many of the great and good of Indian cricket were lying their heads off to Justice Chandrachud. Azharuddin has to account for \u00a32.5 million pounds of extra income. It looks bleak for Kapil Dev and Ajay Jadeja. And Ajit Wadekar admits deception, shrugging off his lies with a 'Who reads the report anyway?' Quite a few people now, one might think, and most will conclude that there has been a cover-up. </p> <p>Compare and contrast with the Qayyum report. Whereas the Indian cricketers had lined up to proclaim the game pure, the Pakistanis, perhaps in an effort to distinguish themselves from their neighbours, well and truly dished the dirt. The only constant in the Pakistani players' evidence is the name of Wasim Akram, censured in the report while escaping the life bans meted out to former Test players Salim Malik and Ata-ur-Rehman. Among the players' depositions to Qayyum, the following allegations are made: </p> <p><strong> Javed Miandad:</strong> 'In 1992-93 when I was captain, I was subsequently informed by Idrees, brother of Hanif Kentbury [a bookmaker] that he had bought three of my players, Wasim Akram...' </p> <p><strong> Aamir Sohail:</strong> 'When we were fielding, Akram went away for a while and being vice-captain, I took over. The wicket was taking turn. I employed fielders around the batsmen and succeeded in getting two wickets. When Akram came back, he was very angry and asked me what the hell are you doing.' </p> <p>'The match was against England. There came a time when we were in a winning position. Strangely enough, instead of Moin Khan and Azhar Mahmood who were in good form, Akram promoted himself in the batting order. He scored four runs from 19 deliveries. Pakistan lost the match by eight runs.' </p> <p><strong> Imran Khan:</strong> 'Ata-ur-Rehman told me that he was paid money by Akram to bowl badly.' </p> <p><strong> Rashid Latif:</strong> 'In my view no-balls and wide balls were deliberately bowled by Akram. Two of his deliveries were so wide that I could not pick them up, resulting in fours off byes. Three players had mobile phones, Malik, Akram and Waqar.' </p> <p><strong> Aaqib Javed:</strong> 'Generally the players about whom it is stated they are involved in match-fixing and betting are Malik and Akram.' </p> <p>Now it must be remem bered that Wasim has not at any time volunteered his own version of events, nor has he answered any of these allegations or have a lawyer cross-examine the witnesses. It is not known whether the allegations are motivated by malice or a desire for the truth to come out. None the less, it is certain that Wasim faces a tricky few months as his accounts are investigated and he is kept under surveillance. </p> <p>Not least because of the change in attitude signalled by the differences in the evidence presented to Chandrachud and Qayyum. The code of omerta has been smashed, the crims have fallen out, everyone is talking. The Qayyum report signified this. The fact that the Chandrachud report's credibility is in tatters reiterates it. </p> <p>Players will come forward with tales of match-fixing and will be believed. It is those who claim there is no match-rigging in international cricket who will never again be believed. </p> <p>Tomorrow Outlook publishes an article by Surjit S. Bhalla entitled 'What is an Honest Bookie to do?' It is an intriguing attempt to pin-point the matches fixed by the use of a mathematical model. Of course, it has the whiff of the post-facto about it, but the findings are fascinating. </p> <p>Australian involvement in dodgy matches is high in 1996, peaks in 1997 and then, coincidentally, as the Warne and Waugh affair is made public, plummets. </p> <p>During the Chandrachud inquiry India are involved in no dodgy matches. After everyone is cleared, their MFPs (match-fixing points) soar. </p> <p>Pakistan: very high MFPs between 1995 and 1997, but since Qayyum started investigating in 1998 nothing. </p> <p>South Africa: no MFPs until 2000. But under Cronje, one of the highest rankings recorded. </p> <p>Bhalla concludes his article: 'The Asia Cup starts at the end of May. Enjoy this affair, for it will be the first clean tournament in quite some time. It will be notable for the telling absence of mobile phones from the dressing room.' Straight cricket. Now there's a change.</p>",

He scored four runs from 19 deliveries. Pakistan lost the match by eight runs.' Imran Khan: 'Ata-ur-Rehman told me that he was paid money by Akram to bowl badly.' Rashid Latif: 'In my view no-balls and wide balls were deliberately bowled by Akram. Two of his deliveries were so wide that I could not pick them up, resulting in fours off byes. Three players had mobile phones, Malik, Akram and Waqar.' Aaqib Javed: 'Generally the players about whom it is stated they are involved in match-fixing and betting are Malik and Akram.' Now it must be remem bered that Wasim has not at any time volunteered his own version of events, nor has he answered any of these allegations or have a lawyer cross-examine the witnesses. It is not known whether the allegations are motivated by malice or a desire for the truth to come out. None the less, it is certain that Wasim faces a tricky few months as his accounts are investigated and he is kept under surveillance. Not least because of the change in attitude signalled by the differences in the evidence presented to Chandrachud and Qayyum. The code of omerta has been smashed, the crims have fallen out, everyone is talking. The Qayyum report signified this. The fact that the Chandrachud report's credibility is in tatters reiterates it. Players will come forward with tales of match-fixing and will be believed. It is those who claim there is no match-rigging in international cricket who will never again be believed. Tomorrow Outlook publishes an article by Surjit S. Bhalla entitled 'What is an Honest Bookie to do?' It is an intriguing attempt to pin-point the matches fixed by the use of a mathematical model. Of course, it has the whiff of the post-facto about it, but the findings are fascinating. Australian involvement in dodgy matches is high in 1996, peaks in 1997 and then, coincidentally, as the Warne and Waugh affair is made public, plummets. During the Chandrachud inquiry India are involved in no dodgy matches. After everyone is cleared, their MFPs (match-fixing points) soar. Pakistan: very high MFPs between 1995 and 1997, but since Qayyum started investigating in 1998 nothing. South Africa: no MFPs until 2000. But under Cronje, one of the highest rankings recorded. Bhalla concludes his article: 'The Asia Cup starts at the end of May. Enjoy this affair, for it will be the first clean tournament in quite some time. It will be notable for the telling absence of mobile phones from the dressing room.' Straight cricket. Now there's a change.",

The fact that the goal difference is so close at 106-84 tells the story. The Reds are a superb attacking side but their defending has left a great deal to be desired, despite the heroics of player-of-the-year defender Chris Morgan who has been checked by several top clubs already.

Since then the loan-signing supersub from Vitesse Arnhem has added power and creativity to midfield and scored some important goals in the anxious last weeks of the battle for promotion. He would love to complete the mission at Wembley. </p> <p>'Things can go quickly,'says Reuser, a 25-year-old attacking midfielder. In those two months Reuser is transformed from a depressed player in an Amsterdam dressing room to a confident Wembley finalist. 'It feels good to be appreciated again.' Although even this year he played and scored for Ajax in the Uefa Cup, he had walked into a dead-end street under new manager Jan Wouters. Reuser had certainly seen better times. After years in the Dutch Under-21 side he earned himself a chance in Frank Rijkaard's full squad in a friendly against Ghana in 1998. But these past few weeks he has vigorously fought for Ipswich's Premiership dreams. Born and raised in Amsterdam, Reuser entered the Ajax youth training program and was signed by the club in 1993 at the age of 18. He played a small part Ajax's victorious Champions League campaign in 1995, but after that he was a regular for Louis van Gaal's side. Midway through 97/98 he went to Vitesse Arnhem. As the ambitious club rose into the top three in the Dutch league for the first time in the club's history, Reuser had his best two seasons so far. Then he returned to the struggling Ajax side at the beginning of this season, with high hopes of earning a spot in the first eleven after Jari Litmanen left for Barcelona. But Reuser did not fit the plans of manager Wouters and was on the bench for most of the winter. </p> <p>'This season I felt I deserved more than that. Wouters had promised me a proper chance,' says the ambitious player, 'but when I had performed well, I was on the bench the next and sometimes when I had played crap I was back in. I did not see the logic in that. </p> <p>'I'd like to stay in England. The football here suits me and I am playing better each week. The game against Barnsley is therefore as important for the club as it is for me personally. If we win, Ipswich will probably want to buy me, if we lose they won't. I hope to play from the start at Wembley - if not, I'll try to make a difference from the bench as I have done before.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gillingham gained promotion to the First Division for the first time in their 107-year history after a sensational comeback against Wigan at Wembley today. The Gills were staring at a second successive defeat in the Second Division play-off final with just seven minutes of extra time remaining against the 10-man Latics. But substitutes Steve Butler and Andy Thomson grabbed vital goals after Stuart Barlow's penalty had put the Lancashire side 2-1 ahead after the game had ended 1-1 after 90 minutes. The result more than made up for the Kent club's agonising penalty shoot-out defeat against Manchester City last season. The dramatic finale had come after Simon Haworth had equalised for Wigan, following Pat McGibbon's first-half own goal. When Kevin Sharp was sent off for a second bookable offence close to the end of normal time Wigan looked out of contention, but they took an incredible extra-time lead through Barlow after Darren Sheridan was upended by Barry Ashby. Trailing 2-1 with just seven minutes to go, the Gills seemed to have blown their promotion chance for the second successive year but Junior Lewis crossed for Butler, whose bullet header gave Latics keeper Derek Stillie no chance. And with the dreaded spot-kick shoot-out looming, Peter Taylor's side snatched victory - and promotion - when Thomson latched onto Ty Gooden's centre and guided his header into the far corner. Wigan had started brightly and created the first chance of note after three minutes when Andy Liddell's cross found Simon Haworth on the six-yard box but he could only direct his header straight at Gillingham goalkeeper Vince Bartram. With Darren Sheridan pulling the midfield strings for Wigan and linking up well with Liddell, Peter Taylor's side were being forced to work hard for the ball. Liddell was again at the heart of the action in the 26th minute when he beat Gills' former Arsenal keeper with a wonderful 25-yard effort which clipped the top of the crossbar and bounced away to safety. The near-miss spurred the Kent side into action with midfield general Andy Hessenthaler inspiring his side to break the deadlock. He found Asaba on the right and the striker's teasing cross was met by Onuora, who tangled with McGibbon and forced the Northern Ireland international into deflecting the ball into his own goal. Arjan De Zeeuw attempted to clear the shot off the line but referee Rob Styles was satisfied that the ball had crossed the line after receiving indication from his assistant. But Wigan fought back and drew level in the 51st minute through a wonderful piece of opportunism from Haworth. After Adrian Pennock had blocked the striker's original attempt, the ball broke to Neil Redfearn on the left and his cross was flicked in the air by Haworth at the near post, before the club's record signing looped a delightful volley into the far corner from the tightest of angles. The game burst into life with both sides keen to grab a potential winning goal and De Zeeuw saw his header cleared off the line by Nicky Southall, who seemed to be standing inside the goal. With Gillingham on top in the latter stages, Latics manager John Benson threw on striker Barlow in place of Redfearn but his plans were radically altered by Sharp's 86th-minute dismissal. And in the end it was the Gills who had the last say and can now look forward to playing in the First Division next season.",

Housing a magnificent castle, cathedral, old hospital and variety of bell towers, it is also the burial site of all but four of the nation's kings.

Every brick, cobble, and flagstone is a testament to how Krakow has survived the turbulent centuries. Despite occupations, invasions and partitions, most recently by Nazis and Communists, Krakow has hung on to a cultural independence that has been fiercely protected by its inhabitants. </p> <p>Some locals say national pride has resulted in a conservatism that prevents the city from moving on and embracing new ideas. But given that Krakow was the only Polish city that physically survived World War II (85 per cent damage was inflicted on Warsaw and Gdansk), for many others including Sister Anna its fairytale towers and cobbled streets provide a historical continuity that is a nec essary part of the Polish identity.

There is also a vibrant caf\u00e9 culture on a par with that of Vienna or Prague. You can sit for hours watching old men play chess and listen to local musicians and the hourly trumpet call. Yet what separates Krakow from her central European cousins is that she has not totally given in to commercialism and gloss. While there is an abundance of hamburger joints and Internet caf\u00e9s displaying the influence of the West, there is still just enough dust, just enough dirt and just enough lack of English spoken, to feel you are in an authentic city. </p> <p>Everything in Krakow is half an hour's walk from the Rynek, so if you have the time it is well worth exploring the narrow streets and quiet courtyards full of secret little shops and restaurants. I was taken to what seemed to be an anonymous entrance on nearby Stasi Street but was instead an echo of times past: a workers' caf\u00e9, serving the most amazing selection of perogi (dumplings) and borscht (beetroot soup) for around \u00a33. A discreet sign on the kitchen door warned customers: 'Open from 12.30pm till all the lunches run out.' </p> <p>At night I investigated Krakow's cellars, where there are many restaurants serving international food. But as I wanted to try Polish food, locals suggested Pod Aniolami (Under the Angels) on Grodzka Street where I dined on heavy, classic country fare such as venison, pork and barley soup. </p> <p>Close to the Rynek are many quiet and uncrowded museums which house gems you would queue for hours to see in London or Paris. There is something mesmerising about spending a whole morning uninterrupted with Leonardo Da Vinci, so it was well worth finding the discreet entrance to the Czartoryski Palace in Jana Street to see The Lady with an Ermine and Rembrandt's breathtaking Landscape with the Good Samaritan . </p> <p>On the other side of the square is the city's Jagiellonian University, one of the oldest in Europe, where you can see the instruments used by Corpernicus to determine that the world was round (for which he was excommunicated) standing next to the recent Oscar won by Andrzej Wajda, a native of Krakow, for his lifetime devotion to film. </p> <p>Another significant part of the city, and one that many people from around the world come especially to visit, is Krakow's old Jewish district, Kazimierz, just behind Wawel hill. Once a town independent of Krakow and named after King Kazimierz in 1335, the area developed into a bustling trading centre with a cross-section of Christians and Jews. In 1495, however, King Olbracht moved an already large Jewish community from the university district to Kazimierz and it became one of the largest ghettos in Poland. </p> <p>No one can visit this community, with its beautiful Renaissance synagogues and carved Yiddish shop signs, without sensing the events up to and after 1939, when Krakow's Jewish community was destroyed in nearby Auschwitz. Though there are still quite a few houses boarded up and desolate, the area is reviving, with new hotels and shops opening each month. In Szeroka Square, the main focus of the district, with its striking Old Synagogue, and a range of merchant houses, there is a lively atmosphere, especially in the evenings, where bands play live Klezmer music and restaurants offer traditional Jewish fare. In the summer, a Jewish Festival has a devoted following. </p> <p>There is still a long way to go in reviving Kazimierz. But increased interest in the history of Krakow's Jews (due in part to Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List , which was filmed here - there is a plethora of framed napkins signed by him in the caf\u00e9s) and an influx of visitors mean life and trade are slowly beginning regenerate. As in so much of this cosmopolitan city, the past is entwined very visibly with the present. Krakow is also a visual and poetic treat which, like the sound of the city's trumpet, resonates inside you long after you leave.</p>",

The inconsequential cuckoo clock may still head the list of artifacts Switzerland has given the world, but there are now a number of impressive entries below it (and not just those nice, bright Swatch designs, either). </p> <p>The Swiss gave us, for example, London's Tate Modern, delivered on time to widespread acclaim by the cutting-edge architects Herzog and de Meuron. And on 14 June the Sadler's Wells Theatre in London will be visited for the first time by Zurich Ballet, under the innovative artistic directorship of Heinz Spoerli. </p> <p>It is not a coincidence. Britain is in the middle of a cultural exchange with Switzerland. So far this month the 22-year-old pianist Antoine Rebstein and the conductor Matthias Bamert have both visited the South Bank. So, if the Swiss are offering us all this, what are they keeping back for themselves - apart from a lot of decidedly superior chocolate? It takes less than two hours to fly to Zurich and find out how the city entertains the wealthy international bankers and business people who have chosen to live or work there for persuasive financial reasons. </p> <p>The city is spread out around one end of a beautiful lake - yes, Lake Zurich - which promptly turns into a river and runs through the smart, old town. There are no skyscrapers in view and it's hard, as a tourist, to convince yourself that the place really is the global hub of everything financially hub-like. </p> <p>Certainly, everything is indecently organised and clean - I even saw a man on a ladder polishing the inside of a street lamp - but it is a much more relaxed country than the Swiss generally let on. Take a boat out on Lake Zurich and you will see that the city is bordered by rolling hills and some of the most deluxe, Heidi-style chalets imaginable. These wooden homes are usually flanked by several little versions of themselves, all laid out around the grounds: a summer house, say, or a boat house, or a swimming pool changing-room. </p> <p>This makes for idle and pleasant 'lives of the rich and famous' style sightseeing. In fact, the chalet turns out to be the key to understanding why Switzerland has become a kind of well-to-do rest home for the stressed-out of Europe. In English the word 'chalet' is now synonymous with holiday home and that's because Switzerland is where the idea of enjoying a sedentary, scenic holiday originated. Wealthy foreigners would stop off during a tour of the cultural heritage of Europe to unwind and take the waters and enjoy the beneficial air. </p> <p>This is also why the best hotel schools are still in Switzerland and why the Swiss take service and efficiency so seriously. They quickly learnt that it paid off. Before I arrived in Zurich I was told the inhabitants would have used the bank holiday weekend to escape the city. It was hard to see why: there was nothing to escape, just the odd reckless pedalo zooming towards you on the lake, or perhaps rollerbladers careering down the tram tracks. </p> <p>So, as a spurious way to test Swiss punctuality rather than because I needed to get out of town, I took the train to Lucerne to hear an evening concert. I left shortly after a matinee of Zurich Ballet's inventive production of Prokoviev's Cinderella and, not an hour later, pulled into Lucerne, next to an astonishingly modern concert hall. </p> <p>After listening to Beethoven, I sauntered to a rustic-looking restaurant and ordered a local delicacy - a meat and potato-filled vol-au-vent that appeared to have taken a course of steroids. This weighty meal brought home the point that almost everything on the menu in Switzerland involves both meat and potatoes. After a few days, a walk in the mountains becomes essential. </p> <p>From Zurich you can travel to the stunning Jungfrau, or, if you are a fan of Arthur Conan Doyle, take a day trip out to the Reichenbach Falls, down which Sherlock and Moriarty notoriously plunged. </p> <p>I decided to follow in Mark Twain's footsteps and set out instead for the summit of Mount Rigi, overlooking Lake Lucerne. But while Twain took three days to climb through the all the cows and daisies to get to the snow and blooming edelweiss of the upper slopes, I took it easy inside the carriage of a cog wheel train. Naturally though, I thought better of it when it came to the return trip. Pulling on my anorak, lacing up my boots, I opted for the even more commodious cable car ride down to Weggis.</p>",

It takes less than two hours to fly to Zurich and find out how the city entertains the wealthy international bankers and business people who have chosen to live or work there for persuasive financial reasons. The city is spread out around one end of a beautiful lake - yes, Lake Zurich - which promptly turns into a river and runs through the smart, old town. There are no skyscrapers in view and it's hard, as a tourist, to convince yourself that the place really is the global hub of everything financially hub-like. Certainly, everything is indecently organised and clean - I even saw a man on a ladder polishing the inside of a street lamp - but it is a much more relaxed country than the Swiss generally let on. Take a boat out on Lake Zurich and you will see that the city is bordered by rolling hills and some of the most deluxe, Heidi-style chalets imaginable. These wooden homes are usually flanked by several little versions of themselves, all laid out around the grounds: a summer house, say, or a boat house, or a swimming pool changing-room. This makes for idle and pleasant 'lives of the rich and famous' style sightseeing. In fact, the chalet turns out to be the key to understanding why Switzerland has become a kind of well-to-do rest home for the stressed-out of Europe. In English the word 'chalet' is now synonymous with holiday home and that's because Switzerland is where the idea of enjoying a sedentary, scenic holiday originated. Wealthy foreigners would stop off during a tour of the cultural heritage of Europe to unwind and take the waters and enjoy the beneficial air. This is also why the best hotel schools are still in Switzerland and why the Swiss take service and efficiency so seriously. They quickly learnt that it paid off. Before I arrived in Zurich I was told the inhabitants would have used the bank holiday weekend to escape the city. It was hard to see why: there was nothing to escape, just the odd reckless pedalo zooming towards you on the lake, or perhaps rollerbladers careering down the tram tracks. So, as a spurious way to test Swiss punctuality rather than because I needed to get out of town, I took the train to Lucerne to hear an evening concert. I left shortly after a matinee of Zurich Ballet's inventive production of Prokoviev's Cinderella and, not an hour later, pulled into Lucerne, next to an astonishingly modern concert hall. After listening to Beethoven, I sauntered to a rustic-looking restaurant and ordered a local delicacy - a meat and potato-filled vol-au-vent that appeared to have taken a course of steroids. This weighty meal brought home the point that almost everything on the menu in Switzerland involves both meat and potatoes. After a few days, a walk in the mountains becomes essential. From Zurich you can travel to the stunning Jungfrau, or, if you are a fan of Arthur Conan Doyle, take a day trip out to the Reichenbach Falls, down which Sherlock and Moriarty notoriously plunged. I decided to follow in Mark Twain's footsteps and set out instead for the summit of Mount Rigi, overlooking Lake Lucerne. But while Twain took three days to climb through the all the cows and daisies to get to the snow and blooming edelweiss of the upper slopes, I took it easy inside the carriage of a cog wheel train. Naturally though, I thought better of it when it came to the return trip. Pulling on my anorak, lacing up my boots, I opted for the even more commodious cable car ride down to Weggis.",

      "bodyText": "David Trimble rescued the Northern Ireland peace process from the brink of disaster yesterday. He pulled off an historic political coup by persuading the Ulster Unionist Party to return to the power-sharing Executive. A week after Trimble's attempts to get his party to back the new peace deal appeared doomed to failure, the Unionist leader just managed to persuade enough members of the party's ruling council to back the deal to save the Good Friday Agreement. But tensions immediately emerged following a day of high drama. In a controversial statement, he said he believed Sinn Fein members still needed to be 'house-trained' before they could become bona fide democrats. This remark is likely to cause widespread anger throughout the republican movement. Asked by reporters if his term 'housetrained' compared Sinn Fein to dogs, Trimble retorted: 'That's your language, not mine.' After the highly charged meeting yesterday morning, the council eventually voted by 459 votes to 403 to accept the deal. Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, who had personally staked his reputation on the resumption of the Northern Ireland Assembly, immediately signed papers to allow the Executive, including two Sinn Fein Ministers, to meet again on Tuesday. The whole assembly will meet for the first time since it was suspended by Mandelson in January. 'No one who has witnessed the last week will underestimate the effort and commitment David Trimble has shown,' Mandelson said. 'At the same time I want to recognise how difficult many Unionists will have found it coming to this decision.' Bertie Ahern, the Irish Prime Minister, welcomed the deal but said that the closeness of the result - 53 per cent to 47 per cent - was a concern. 'Of course, there is a lot of concern,' Ahern admitted. 'It would be far nicer if the 47 per cent was instead 7 per cent. 'It is now time for everyone definitively to seize this opportunity for a shared future of peace, partnership and prosperity. 'I believe that this time the Assembly is back for good. That is certainly what we want to see.' Ahern said the IRA must now stick to its agreement from earlier this month to put its guns 'beyond use'. 'I hope they will implement it as quickly as possible, within a matter of weeks, as they agreed,' he said. Shortly after the result was announced, Trimble issued a warning that his party could walk out of the Executive if the IRA failed to deliver on its promises to open arms dumps for inspection and put their weapons of war beyond use. The jaded-looking UUP leader acknowledged that the vote had been extremely close and that the party had stretched itself to breaking point. 'There is a limit to how far we can stretch ourselves without an adequate response being made by the IRA,' he said. 'The republican movement has promised to put a confi dence building measure in place within a matter of weeks. 'Two weeks have already gone since that promise was made, I expect that promise to be delivered fairly soon now. If there is any foot-dragging, there will be difficulties.' On 6 May the IRA broke the deadlock in the peace process by offering to put its arms beyond use and open up its weapons dumps for full inspection by independent observers from South Africa and Finland. Flanked by his wife Daphne and the UUP president Josias Cunningham, Trimble thanked his deputy, John Taylor, for his eleventh-hour support which had been 'enormously helpful'. The deputy leader weighed in to support Trimble yester day morning following his return from a week-long tour of the Far East. Taylor had initially said he could not support the deal. Despite the knife-edge narrowness of the result, opponents of the Good Friday Agreement appeared to be deeply shaken by their last-minute defeat. The UUP anti-Agreement faction had fought a sophisticated campaign over the last fortnight to persuade delegates to reject re-entering a coalition with Sinn Fein. Speaking after the meeting while extremist loyalist protesters hurled abuse at Trimble and his entourage, Roy Beggs Jnr, the Assembly member for East Antrim, said he was still deeply sceptical. 'They say there is no alternative to this deal. Does that mean that if the deal is not accepted, the IRA will go back to war again? That's blackmail and I cannot support it,' he said.",

      "body": "<p>There's nothing like a real Hollywood flop. Not an average bad movie doing averagely badly, but a complete wreck of a film that makes you wonder what the hell anyone was thinking of when they decided to make it and how the hell anyone had the guts to release it. </p> <p>There's no doubt that this year that film is Battlefield Earth . It's not just that the reviews were beyond brutal (' Battlefield Earth may well turn out to be the worst movie of this century,' suggested the New York Times ), or the fact that the box-office figures have been pitiful for a $70 million movie. It's more precise than that: the statistics showed that the audience crumbled between its first Saturday on release and the Sunday. In other words, people were calling their friends and strongly advising them not to see this film. </p> <p>But that's barely the start of the Battlefield Earth catastrophe. Because the film isn't just any old lame sci-fi movie about a race of evil aliens who have conquered the earth. This is the film John Travolta has been struggling to make for at least a decade, his true labour of love. Yet even with Travolta's name behind it, no one was dumb enough to stump up the cash until hustling producer Elie Samaha started sucking up to big stars at a time when the studios were starting to worry that they were a waste of cash. Orig inally, Travolta was going to play the hero of Battlefield Earth , Johnny Goodboy Tyler. But the years drifted by and he grew too old for the part, and had to settle instead for playing the 10-foot, dreadlocked alien leader with the bizarre (British?) accent. Travolta wanted Brad Pitt to play Tyler, but had to settle for the little-known Barry Pepper. </p> <p>'It will be like Star Wars, only better,' Travolta used to say. Well, in a word, no. In two ghastly weeks, Travolta's reputation has dived back to where it was before Pulp Fiction . So why did he do it? Simple: the novel Battlefield Earth was written by L. Ron Hubbard, who apart from being a master of immense, turgid sci-fi epics, was the founder of the Church Of Scientology. And Travolta is one of Hollywood's many devoted followers of Hubbard's weird self-help creed. </p> <p>In fact, before Battlefield Earth was released, a few over-anxious cult watchers had warned about either overt, or subliminal, propaganda for scientology being pushed by the film. As it is, the film has done scientology more damage than anything its opponents could ever have contrived. </p> <p>But let's say Travolta wasn't just obsessed by the book because he is a scientologist. It might just be his favourite novel. That's even sadder. Film stars' long-nurtured pet projects usually have an element of tragic over-ambition to them, a yearning to do something that's either more personal or breaks them out of the restrictions of their star persona. </p> <p>Like Steve McQueen, frustrated with all those years as a taciturn cool guy in cool movies, growing a big bushy beard and donning glasses to star in an Arthur Miller adaptation of Ibsen's An Enemy Of The People . That's Miller and Ibsen . You can imagine how proud McQueen - the executive producer - was to be given the chance to elevate the minds of his audience. And you can imagine how horrified his agent was. It took a couple of years of sitting on a shelf for the film to make it into the cinemas, and then it only had a very short run. And 20 years after McQueen's death, it's clear he's still remembered as that silent guy in the Mustang or on the bike. </p> <p>At least An Enemy Of The People saw the light of day. No such luck for Jerry Lewis's The Day The Clown Cried . In the 1972 film, which Lewis directed and wrote, he played a clown in a concentration camp who is used to lure the children into the gas chambers. Lewis lost 40lbs to play the role, which was designed to transform the reputation of the star of The Nutty Professor forever. But it was never released, for legal reasons rather than seemingly more pressing matters of taste. Mind you, after Life Is Beautiful and Jakob The Liar, The Day The Clown Cried suddenly doesn't seem such an outlandish idea. </p> <p>Its fate was almost mirrored by The Brave, Johnny Depp's directorial debut about an illiterate man who sells himself to a producer of snuff movies. Depp talked his friend Marlon Brando into co-starring, and Iggy Pop into writing the soundtrack. The film was shown at the 1997 Cannes festival, to an astonishingly hostile reception. It was never released in the UK or the US. </p> <p>Even when a star's baby gets merely mediocre reviews and revenues, it can still backfire. Girl, Interrupted appealed to Winona Ryder because of her own history of psychiatric trouble. So naturally, she took the central role as the author/narrator, even though she was a good 10 years too old for the part. She was promptly blown off the screen by the Oscar-nabbing Angelina Jolie. </p> <p>Worthy intentions can't save you either: Bruce Willis used his own money to get Breakfast Of Champions made, ignoring the conventional wisdom that Kurt Vonnegut's work doesn't translate to film. The film was released last year in the US to utter indifference from the critics and the public. </p> <p>Which is why even the biggest stars can find it impossible to get their pet projects made. As one old studio hand warned: 'The problem is that you're dealing with people who are so obsessed with a project that they've lost all objectivity.' </p> <p>At the height of his identification with Native Americans, Marlon Brando tried to get Martin Scorsese to direct The Battle Of Wounded Knee . Scorsese wasn't biting. Brando then spent years cooking up projects with wayward genius Donald Cammell, the co-director of Performance . Unsurprisingly, they never got anywhere. </p> <p>But the real heartbreaker is Sylvester Stallone's Edgar Allan Poe movie. Stallone started the script in 1970, long before he had found stardom, and plugged away at it throughout the Rocky and Rambo years. Yet even when he was the world's biggest film star, money for him to play Poe was never laid on the table. He was still tinkering with the idea in the 1990s, but as the years passed it began to sound like his heart had gone out of it. 'As I get older, Poe gets older,' he said at one point. No longer, presumably: Stallone has now lived 14 years longer than the opium-eating poet and writer. </p> <p>Then there's Meg Ryan, who has hauled her Sylvia Plath script from studio to studio for the best part of a decade. It's easy enough to see why they all passed, even before you hear Ryan's reasons for wanting to make the film. 'I am totally fascinated by that woman. I think Sylvia Plath speaks to women forever, but especially now, because more than ever we are these multi-tasking people with a lot to accomplish - and on top of everything else, she was a mother. To be an artist and a mother - those are two very difficult things to reconcile.' And there you were thinking the Plath myth was all about the intensity of the poetry and her tortured relationship with Ted Hughes. </p> <p>Just occasionally, stars get away with it. Burt Lancaster's The Swimmer was received almost as badly as Battlefield Earth when it was released in 1968, but these days it is largely viewed as a pretty interesting film. In case Travolta tries to take any comfort from the story, he should be reminded that as Lancaster's source material was John Cheever rather than L. Ron Hubbard, respectability was always nearer at hand. </p> <p>And while in 1984 it seemed truly barmy that Bill Murray was writing and starring in an adaptation of Somerset Maugham's The Razor's Edge , his reputation has grown so much since that it seems like an interesting curiosity rather than an act of stupidity. And there was widespread scepticism when Gary Oldman, at a time when he was Hollywood's evil mastermind of choice, kept insisting he was about to make an autobiographical film in south London. But the sneering stopped after Nil By Mouth . It helped, of course, that Oldman stayed behind the camera and that he wanted to make a realist European film. </p> <p>There is one star who shows that you can make Hollywood fulfil your dreams, no matter how crazy they are. And they don't come much more deranged than taking a minor Isaac Bashevis Singer short story and blowing it up into a two hour 13 minute musical with 12 songs. Then, casting a 40-year-old woman as a 20-year-old who could pass for a man. Truly, the fact that Barbra Streisand was not only allowed to produce, direct and star in Yentl , but wasn't chased out of town by a lynch mob when the film came out shows that she exists on a different planet from the rest of us. No matter how misguided Battlefield Earth might be, when it comes to untethered self-indulgence, Travolta is strictly a beginner. </p> <p>Battlefield Earth is released on 2 June</p>",

      "body": "<p>I woke up last Monday morning wondering whether I had dreamt, or had actually heard on my bedside radio, that Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark had won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and that the Swedish Academy had convened an emergency session to confer a posthumous Nobel Prize for Literature on Barbara Cartland. </p> <p>On checking the morning papers, I discovered that the least likely of the two was in fact true, thus fulfilling my ironic prediction in last week's Observer that Dancer in the Dark could be the sort of kitsch that Luc Besson, president of the 53rd Cannes jury, might go for. </p> <p>So if the organisers thought that a jury which included the actors Kristin Scott Thomas, Barbara Sukowa and Jeremy Irons, and the novelists Patrick Modiano and Arundhati Roy, would correct the absurdity of last year's principal prizes, they were mistaken. Von Trier's inept musical, starring Bj\u00f6rk as a Czech immigrant factory worker condemned to death in Sixties America for a murder she didn't commit, does very badly what Dennis Potter's Pennies From Heaven did supremely well. Its arrogant hit-and-miss director, a weird mixture of the naive and the sophisticated, brings to mind a remark of Isaiah Berlin's about a flamboyant literary intellectual: 'He's an example of that rare phenomenon, the authentic charlatan.' </p> <p>As for Bj\u00f6rk, honoured above Lena Endre (Liv Ullmann's Faithless) Emmanuelle B\u00e9art (Olivier Assayas's Les Destin\u00e9es Sentimentales) and Juliette Binoche (Michael Haneke's Code Inconnu) as the festival's best actress, I can only say that although a lifelong opponent of capital punishment, I couldn't wait for the hangman to pull the lever on the trapdoor. But we had to watch as she sang her way down death row to the gallows, dropping in to raise the spirits of assorted male inmates, and then warbled another dirge with the noose around her neck. </p> <p>Of course Dancer in the Dark might turn out to be a hit - though given the choice between this and Springtime for Hitler, Max Bialystock of The Producers might well have had second thoughts. If you want to see an off-beat musical, look out for Stephen Daldry's attractive directorial debut, Dancer, shown in the Directors Fortnight and set in Durham during the 1984 miners' strike. This is Stepping Out meets Kes, a sentimental, crowd-pleasing tale of an 11-year-old Geordie lad (Jamie Bell), reared in the macho world of coal miners, but discovering his vocation as a ballet dancer with the encouragement of teacher Julie Walters. It got the warmest reception I heard in Cannes this year. </p> <p>The choice of the Chinese anti-war comedy, Devils on the Doorstep (of which I wrote last week), for the Grand Prix du Jury was misguided, but not contemptible. The general critical consensus, though, was that if the prize was to go to a lengthy Asian picture the proper choice would have been Edward Yang's admirable Yi Yi (which won the Best Director prize) or Shinji Aoyoma's 317-minute Eureka about the healing of three people who survive a bus hi-jack massacre. Tony Leung's best actor in Wong Kar-Wai's In the Mood for Love, a Hong Kong variation on Brief Encounter shown as the final competitive film (and not finally edited until the previous night), was well deserved. So was the Jury Prize that I hopefully predicted last week would go to Samira Makhmalbaf's Blackboards.

      "bodyText": "I woke up last Monday morning wondering whether I had dreamt, or had actually heard on my bedside radio, that Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark had won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and that the Swedish Academy had convened an emergency session to confer a posthumous Nobel Prize for Literature on Barbara Cartland. On checking the morning papers, I discovered that the least likely of the two was in fact true, thus fulfilling my ironic prediction in last week's Observer that Dancer in the Dark could be the sort of kitsch that Luc Besson, president of the 53rd Cannes jury, might go for. So if the organisers thought that a jury which included the actors Kristin Scott Thomas, Barbara Sukowa and Jeremy Irons, and the novelists Patrick Modiano and Arundhati Roy, would correct the absurdity of last year's principal prizes, they were mistaken. Von Trier's inept musical, starring Bj\u00f6rk as a Czech immigrant factory worker condemned to death in Sixties America for a murder she didn't commit, does very badly what Dennis Potter's Pennies From Heaven did supremely well. Its arrogant hit-and-miss director, a weird mixture of the naive and the sophisticated, brings to mind a remark of Isaiah Berlin's about a flamboyant literary intellectual: 'He's an example of that rare phenomenon, the authentic charlatan.' As for Bj\u00f6rk, honoured above Lena Endre (Liv Ullmann's Faithless) Emmanuelle B\u00e9art (Olivier Assayas's Les Destin\u00e9es Sentimentales) and Juliette Binoche (Michael Haneke's Code Inconnu) as the festival's best actress, I can only say that although a lifelong opponent of capital punishment, I couldn't wait for the hangman to pull the lever on the trapdoor. But we had to watch as she sang her way down death row to the gallows, dropping in to raise the spirits of assorted male inmates, and then warbled another dirge with the noose around her neck. Of course Dancer in the Dark might turn out to be a hit - though given the choice between this and Springtime for Hitler, Max Bialystock of The Producers might well have had second thoughts. If you want to see an off-beat musical, look out for Stephen Daldry's attractive directorial debut, Dancer, shown in the Directors Fortnight and set in Durham during the 1984 miners' strike. This is Stepping Out meets Kes, a sentimental, crowd-pleasing tale of an 11-year-old Geordie lad (Jamie Bell), reared in the macho world of coal miners, but discovering his vocation as a ballet dancer with the encouragement of teacher Julie Walters. It got the warmest reception I heard in Cannes this year. The choice of the Chinese anti-war comedy, Devils on the Doorstep (of which I wrote last week), for the Grand Prix du Jury was misguided, but not contemptible. The general critical consensus, though, was that if the prize was to go to a lengthy Asian picture the proper choice would have been Edward Yang's admirable Yi Yi (which won the Best Director prize) or Shinji Aoyoma's 317-minute Eureka about the healing of three people who survive a bus hi-jack massacre. Tony Leung's best actor in Wong Kar-Wai's In the Mood for Love, a Hong Kong variation on Brief Encounter shown as the final competitive film (and not finally edited until the previous night), was well deserved. So was the Jury Prize that I hopefully predicted last week would go to Samira Makhmalbaf's Blackboards. She shared it with Songs From the Second Floor, a quirky Swedish comedy set in a decaying modern city in a state of post-millennial freefall and shot in a series of deep-focus tableaux with no cuts or camera movements within each sequence. Songs From the Second Floor is the first full-length feature for 25 years by Roy Andersson, a director of TV commercials (and no kin to Benny Andersson of Abba who wrote the film's score).

The only people on the street are pale, anxious film types rushing from their early breakfast meeting to their '9.30'. Everyone is on the phone as they walk. The extraordinary thing about Cannes is that despite the surface glitz, most people get up early and work - only the tourists have suntans. </p> <p>Unlike any other festival I have ever been to, Cannes is a workaholic's dream. 'Who did you meet?' my friends say on my return. Well, for the most part, it is the same people I would bump into on a wet Tuesday at the Ivy (Elton John aside). I meet an old friend who makes the mistake of asking how I am. I burble on about technical compromises: 'The sound isn't right, I'm worried about the reel changes...' etc. Rapidly realising I'm being just another neurotic director, they make their excuses and rush on. My producer, Jon Finn, takes me for a coffee and a brandy. </p> <p><strong> THURSDAY </strong>I am back at Heathrow to pick up the star of my film, Jamie Bell (age 14), and his mother Eileen, who have come down from Billingham in Teesside where they live. Jamie has never flown before so I promised I would go with him on his first trip. His worry over flying is entirely matched by my fear that neither he nor his mum have yet seen the finished film. A Daily Mail photographer is at Heathrow to meet him. Luckily, he is a decent fellow, so Jamie's first experience of press attention is a mild one. Part of me hopes the film will slip under the press radar so he does not have to deal with anything heavier. </p> <p><strong> FRIDAY </strong>The big day. A 2pm press screening and the 8.30pm official closing night film of Directors' Fortnight. Another technical run-through at some ungodly hour. Thankfully, the projectionist listens with great concern to my neurotic babbling: 'Why are the acoustics in here so bright?' I ask. 'The audience will deaden it, don't worry,' he replies. I decide to believe him and go and meet Jamie and his mum. Over an early lunch I am catatonic with anxiety. Jon takes Jamie swimming and I loiter in my room. I have been told not to watch the afternoon press screening but nevertheless try to slip in - just to make sure they are actually watching the right film. </p> <p>The screening is sold out and the doorman is not having any of it. 'I have a ticket,' I plead. 'Full up,' he says. 'I am the director.' He looks me up and down. 'Still full up.' Totally frustrated, I rush by him as he shouts for security, and manage to hop into the projection box unseen. I watch through the small glass window. It certainly looks like my film. It is currently broken up into six sections, or reels, and the smooth transfer from one to another is totally dependent on the skill of the projec tionist. 'How's it going?' I ask him. He gives thumbs up and smiles. I relax a fraction, stay until I can hear the audience actually laugh then leave to be escorted off the premises by security. </p> <p>After the screening, there is to be a press conference. Many of the crew from the film meet us in the lobby of the Carlton Hotel, then we walk over to the conference together. I suppose I had been expecting a small, informal gathering Royal Court-style, over a warm glass of wine. But here we are faced with a podium, microphones, and a packed tent with more than 150 people. Camera flashes, TV crews and a rapturous round of applause greet Jamie and his co-stars, Julie Walters and Gary Lewis. The response is overwhelming. I manage to catch the eye of Jamie's mum who seems to be asking: 'Did these people watch our film?' </p> <p>Jamie sailed through the conference like a pro, with just the right balance of humour, innocence and generosity. I don't think I shall ever forget the experience of watching him afterwards, walking up the Croisette in bright sunshine, graciously accepting the applause of the audience lining the pavement. </p> <p>The evening performance is the first time Jamie, his mother, Julie and Gary have seen the film. I sit next to Jamie anxiously waiting for his first reaction. As soon as he laughs with the rest of the audience I sit back and once again go through the emotional roller coaster of watching the film. Just like in the theatre, I re-enact every moment, pause, gesture and line in my head, without the benefit of actually releasing that emotion through performance. As the sweat starts to pour down my face something unexpected happens: the audience bursts into spontaneous applause after the first dance routine. I steal a look at Jamie who gives me a cheeky grin back. I feel myself almost begin to relax. </p> <p> Stephen Daldry's Dancer opens in the UK on 29 September</p>",

And there were a couple of pregnancies (crew). </p> <p>'Swannies', as regulars refer to themselves, don't rattle easily as they are a very particular brand of person. They are usually middle-aged and upward; they are well-informed and curious. They want to visit unusual places and learn about them, sometimes in depth. They are happy to sit through two or three lectures a day and will make avid use of the 4,000-book library. They like comfortable surroundings, never carry their own luggage and eat prodigious amounts of food at regular intervals. </p> <p>As first-time Swan Hellenic passengers, we joined the boat at Ho Chi Minh City ('Oh call it Saigon,' said the Vietnamese guide. 'We all do because it's so much easier'). The degree of care showed as early as Heathrow and when we changed planes and prepared for a five-hour stopover in Bangkok, Swan Hellenic had the first-class lounge available with big sofas to sleep on and a buffet. When we got to Vietnam we hit the ground running, checked into the hotel to await the ship's arrival, looked round Saigon in the afternoon and next morning went on an excursion north of the city to the Cuchi tunnels, a huge underground labyrinth, often three layers deep, which was the Vietcong stronghold during the Vietnam War. </p> <p>This was the first time we met some of our shipboard passengers and the initial impression was that everybody was keen to find things out. The guide was bombarded with questions, social, economic, political, religious; people were interested to know how the Vietnamese felt about the war, but, on the whole, tactfully so. Passengers already on board had come down the Vietnamese coast from Danang, so were well steeped in facts, but once back aboard as opinions were aired, two passengers came forward and offered to give an impromptu talk on their views of the war: one was a former adviser to Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, the other was Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific Fleet during the war. The packed lecture theatre included a former Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, a couple of rear admirals, judges, peers and QCs. Hardly surprising then that while we crisscrossed the notorious South China Sea there was an hourly pirate patrol added to the ship's security rota. </p> <p>Feeling comparatively youthful and pretty ignorant we sank into shipboard life quickly and gratefully. I hadn't been on a cruise ship since I was a child, when every summer my family would sail to New York on a Cunard liner to summer with my aunt and then I'd puke my way back across the Atlantic. So when Minerva hit the open sea from the Mekong delta I had the pills ready, but we had a smooth crossing. She's a small ship by cruising standards - 346 passengers is her comfortable maximum. She was built by the Russians as a spy ship with an ice-breaking hull, became redundant at the end of the Cold War and was bought by and refitted for P&amp;O, Swan Hellenic's parent company. </p> <p>Her interior is like a country house hotel - oak panelling, traditional prints, carpeted staircases and spacious lounge, bars and dining room. Cabins range from the two Owner's Suites on the upper deck with private balconies (\u00a33,995 per person on our leg of the cruise) via Suite (balcony, \u00a33,765) and Deluxe (big window which had misleading one-way glass that rendered the cabin occupants entirely visible to the deck at night, \u00a33,280) to the more ordinary cabins on A deck (windows) and B deck (portholes). There are small bathrooms, TV that shows a film a day, catches you up with CNN news and relays the daily lectures if you're too idle to make it to the lounge. And, of course, a set of Penguin Modern Classics on the bookshelf. </p> <p>The library's leather armchairs are often occupied by a snoozer or two, somebody is usually poring over the giant jigsaw puzzle and the front pages of international papers are faxed through daily and pinned to the noticeboard along with the nautical chart. Guest speakers take it in turns to man the library desk and are always around for additional information. This cruise was packed with keen botanists (including the Carringtons) who thronged the expeditions on the trip with Dr Phillip Cribb, senior principal botanist at Kew, who had been a speaker on several trips before. </p> <p>A large proportion of Swan passengers are returners. On our trip one couple were on their seventeenth Swan holiday, and one man was on his second - 70 years after the first, on which his parents sent him to the Mediterranean when he was at a loose end aged 17. Our oldest passenger was a spry old bird of 94, but there's a 96-year old regular who is planning a celebratory trip for his hundredth birthday. Passenger feedback is carefully noted. Minerva's predecessor was the smaller Orpheus up until 1997 and many regulars still talk of her almost tearfully. Thirty-three per cent of passengers do two back-to-back cruises in the winter. </p> <p>Swan Hellenic was one of the first companies to venture into Libya, principally to visit the Roman city of Leptis Magna (featured in Escape last week). A couple recalled how after the boat docked apparently in the middle of nowhere, coaches were lined up waiting, an empty hotel was commandeered for toilet facilities and after the ship's crew had scrubbed them out, paper, soap, towels and handcream were set out. There were also tales of Swan Hellenic persuading closed museums to open and another couple remember the Blue Mosque in Istanbul opening its firmly shut doors. </p> <p>Picnic bags and bottled water are handed out on excursions in exotic locations in the interests of health and safety and there's always a doctor or nurse in the party. The downside of health and safety is having to lug a lifejacket on to a sampan crossing the Kuching river, but such are the strictures of modern tourism. Next year Swan goes to the Phillipines for the first time to the joy of the charming crew (170-strong), the bulk of whom come from there, while the housekeepers are mainly Ukrainian. </p> <p>The company discourages tipping, saying its staff are paid above average rates (all the passengers I talked to went along with this), and almost all shore excursions are included in the overall price. Another tradition is the policy of 'open sitting' at meals, initiated by the founder, Ken Swan, where the matre'd seats you next to people in the formal dining room and you simply join a table in the buffet deck room rather than returning daily to a set table. It's not as terrifying as I'd thought. Although dress is pretty casual during the day people dress formally (jacket and tie for men) in the evening for the main dining room, and there's usually at least one black-tie night. Entertainment was along classical lines, from a quartet of students at the Guildhall School of Music, followed by dancing to the Minerva band, interposed with a hilarious evening of songs by the Filipino crew. One couple on their first, and I should imagine last, trip on Minerva, were devastated not to find a casino and lavish floor shows. </p> <p>Days at sea were utter bliss. We saw flying fish, a sizeable shark and a great deal of timber washed down from the Borneo coast. Key deck loungers at the rear of the promenade deck were commandeered by those in the know straight after breakfast, but there is so much space that finding a sunny or shady perch was never a problem. Eight circuits of the promenade deck constitutes a mile, which was our daily aim, and I dragged myself to the gym a couple of times; the seawater pool on the aft deck is precisely four strokes long, so really just for cooling off. But who needs exercise when the longest you can go without daytime food on Minerva is half an hour? Plus that massive library invites itself to be read. A random survey of on-deck reading would put John Grisham pretty near the top, but there were some corking holiday reads including Learning to Read Egyptian and Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time . </p> <p>We missed one Sarawak leg of the trip because we opted for an overnight rainforest excursion into the Mulu National Park, which a party of us, led by explorer Robin Hanbury-Tenison, flew to in small planes. This was a new excursion - spending a short time walking through the rainforest and then exploring the surrounding cave system via longboats.We rejoined the boat in Brunei. Then, oh joy, another day at sea while we sailed down the coast of Sarawak to Kuching. </p> <p>This was an interesting little town once you foraged round the backstreets and found silk and antique shops and the markets selling wonderful spices and alarming parts of fish. An afternoon trip to the Semmenggoh Wildlife Park, where there is a breeding programme for orphaned orang-utan, produced a mother and baby within touching distance. </p> <p>Our final destination was Singapore, which seemed too teeming with traffic and vast shopping malls compared to our previous destinations, but we went on a couple of good excursions, particularly the World War II one, which made terrifying sense of the Japanese invasion from the land side when you stood by the narrow strip of water they crossed so easily. Many passengers had either ruled, served in or rebuilt Singapore, so there was much to be learnt. </p> <p>Leaving Minerva was like being ejected from the womb. For 10 days we hadn't really had to make a decision other than what to eat next and whether another beer at 12.30pm was out of order. It is not the holiday for the cutting edge adventurer, but nor is it for the seeker of highlife. Cruising on Minerva is for those interested in history, culture, traditions and religions, who want to be pampered but not patronised, to bask but not be bored. I'd go back like a shot. </p> <p> The Minerva returns to the region next January. A 17-day Legends of the Far East cruise, departing 29 January, costs from \u00a33,660 per person for an itinerary that includes China, Hong Kong, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Borneo. The theme is geology, natural history and art. Guest speakers include Professor Chris Stillman, a geologist specialising in volcanology (the cruise passes through one of the most active arcs of the Pacific Ring of Fire) and Nigel Colborn, naturalist and gardener, with a special interest in island ecologies and world flora.

Entertainment was along classical lines, from a quartet of students at the Guildhall School of Music, followed by dancing to the Minerva band, interposed with a hilarious evening of songs by the Filipino crew. One couple on their first, and I should imagine last, trip on Minerva, were devastated not to find a casino and lavish floor shows. Days at sea were utter bliss. We saw flying fish, a sizeable shark and a great deal of timber washed down from the Borneo coast. Key deck loungers at the rear of the promenade deck were commandeered by those in the know straight after breakfast, but there is so much space that finding a sunny or shady perch was never a problem. Eight circuits of the promenade deck constitutes a mile, which was our daily aim, and I dragged myself to the gym a couple of times; the seawater pool on the aft deck is precisely four strokes long, so really just for cooling off. But who needs exercise when the longest you can go without daytime food on Minerva is half an hour? Plus that massive library invites itself to be read. A random survey of on-deck reading would put John Grisham pretty near the top, but there were some corking holiday reads including Learning to Read Egyptian and Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time . We missed one Sarawak leg of the trip because we opted for an overnight rainforest excursion into the Mulu National Park, which a party of us, led by explorer Robin Hanbury-Tenison, flew to in small planes. This was a new excursion - spending a short time walking through the rainforest and then exploring the surrounding cave system via longboats.We rejoined the boat in Brunei. Then, oh joy, another day at sea while we sailed down the coast of Sarawak to Kuching. This was an interesting little town once you foraged round the backstreets and found silk and antique shops and the markets selling wonderful spices and alarming parts of fish. An afternoon trip to the Semmenggoh Wildlife Park, where there is a breeding programme for orphaned orang-utan, produced a mother and baby within touching distance. Our final destination was Singapore, which seemed too teeming with traffic and vast shopping malls compared to our previous destinations, but we went on a couple of good excursions, particularly the World War II one, which made terrifying sense of the Japanese invasion from the land side when you stood by the narrow strip of water they crossed so easily. Many passengers had either ruled, served in or rebuilt Singapore, so there was much to be learnt. Leaving Minerva was like being ejected from the womb. For 10 days we hadn't really had to make a decision other than what to eat next and whether another beer at 12.30pm was out of order. It is not the holiday for the cutting edge adventurer, but nor is it for the seeker of highlife. Cruising on Minerva is for those interested in history, culture, traditions and religions, who want to be pampered but not patronised, to bask but not be bored. I'd go back like a shot. The Minerva returns to the region next January. A 17-day Legends of the Far East cruise, departing 29 January, costs from \u00a33,660 per person for an itinerary that includes China, Hong Kong, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Borneo. The theme is geology, natural history and art. Guest speakers include Professor Chris Stillman, a geologist specialising in volcanology (the cruise passes through one of the most active arcs of the Pacific Ring of Fire) and Nigel Colborn, naturalist and gardener, with a special interest in island ecologies and world flora.

As part of a concerted strategy to capitalise on what it sees as a populist campaign to appeal to working-class voters, the Government last night intensified the debate over class and education by signalling that students from state schools were to be offered easier entry to Britain's leading medical schools. The Health Secretary, Alan Milburn, will shortly unveil a pilot scheme in effect helping disadvantaged pupils win places at medical school with lower grades if they show academic potential untapped at school. With the backing of Tony Blair, plans are also being made to introduce 'talent spotters' to tour state schools in an effort to identify promising students and encourage them to apply for places at top universities. The plans emerged ahead of a report this week by Peter Lampl, a close adviser to the Government on education, which will show that thousands of state school pupils - some with the best grades in the country - are being turned down by Britain's best established universities. Faced with a slump in the polls, the Government is determined to launch an all-out offensive on what it regards as the 'forces of privilege', facing down growing criticism that they are engaging in an old-fashioned class war. 'Our aim is advancing opportunity on the basis of merit and excellence,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman said yesterday. 'We are not erecting barriers, we are breaking them down.' Over the next two weeks, speeches by John Prescott, David Blunkett and Gordon Brown will concentrate on the key anti-elitism theme which the Government is convinced will play well to its supporters.

The survey found that 39 per cent of places in all subjects at Britain's top 13 universities were filled by students from the private sector. If selection had been purely according to grades, the figure should have been 28 per cent, the Sutton Trust research concluded. It was not known whether state pupils were being deterred from applying by perceived elitism or discriminated against by other factors. At the top five universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, more than half the places were filled by students from independent schools. The report will be seized on by Brown, who last week angrily attacked Oxford University for rejecting the comprehensive schoolgirl Laura Spence, who had applied to study medicine. And it will further fuel what has now become a concerted Labour push to tackle what it sees as the snobbery and old school ties still holding talented teenagers back. Prescott will underline the theme in a keynote speech on Tuesday attacking the 'forces of elitism'. Blunkett, the Education Secretary, will also refer to the issue in a speech on Thursday and Brown will return to the subject the following week. Blunkett will announce plans for Government-supported talent spotting teams which universities will use to encourage disadvantaged students into the top universities. The idea, which is based on a project at Harvard, has been successfully used at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist), where the number of disadvantaged students matches the proportion in the local community. 'Britain has always worked well for the top 10 per cent in our society,' Prescott will say. 'We are fighting to change Britain, its economy and its institutions, so that it works well for all of our people.' The Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, also joined the attack, calling for the civil service to open up to women and ethnic minorities. The new agenda signals that the Government is moving on to a war footing, needled by William Hague's recent successes on tradi tional Labour issues such as pensions - a theme to which he will return this week. Meanwhile, the Tories will return to the attack today with a fresh dossier of policies for the elderly, to target disillusioned pensioners. Social security spokesman David Willetts will promise benefit changes for pensioners caring for an infirm spouse, and match Labour's commitments to breast cancer screening for women aged 65-69 and to abolishing mixed sex wards. The Tories would also allow war widows to retain their late husband's pension if they remarried, pre-empting a Government review on war pensions.",

      "body": "<p>Poor Laura Spence. Rejection is horrible. Who wouldn't sympathise with her disappointment and the battering her pride must have suffered on being told she wasn't good enough to get into Oxford? </p> <p>To hope that insidious prejudices were at work is an instinctive reaction to soften the blow - I didn't get in, you tell yourself, because I'm not posh enough - the bastards. In the same way, rejected applicants from private schools comfort themselves with the idea that they did not get in because they didn't go to a comprehensive in the North East. </p> <p>But to assert this as hard fact on the Today programme, with your publicity-hungry headmaster prompting you from the sidelines, appears self-serving, bitter and ridiculous. </p> <p>Laura is not alone in this indignant display of sour grapes. A rejection from Oxford or Cambridge seems to fire a special kind of festering resentment that can last a lifetime, evident in snide jibes and accusations of elitism. That people feel this strongly is nothing to do with latent prejudices and the old school tie; it is because Oxford and Cambridge are internationally renowned as centres of excellence, a reputation they maintain by being discerning in their admissions - and no one likes to be told they are not good enough. </p> <p>'It is a scandal that Laura should have to go and study in the States,' her headmaster said. Well, of course, she doesn't have to at all. She had other offers, and there are some very good departments of medicine at other British universities, many of them better equipped than Oxford's; in one sentence, he sweepingly dismissed them all. But for Laura, not even the thrill of a scholarship to Harvard has been enough to take the sting out of being turned down by Oxford. </p> <p>Get over it, Laura.

      "bodyText": "Poor Laura Spence. Rejection is horrible. Who wouldn't sympathise with her disappointment and the battering her pride must have suffered on being told she wasn't good enough to get into Oxford? To hope that insidious prejudices were at work is an instinctive reaction to soften the blow - I didn't get in, you tell yourself, because I'm not posh enough - the bastards. In the same way, rejected applicants from private schools comfort themselves with the idea that they did not get in because they didn't go to a comprehensive in the North East. But to assert this as hard fact on the Today programme, with your publicity-hungry headmaster prompting you from the sidelines, appears self-serving, bitter and ridiculous. Laura is not alone in this indignant display of sour grapes. A rejection from Oxford or Cambridge seems to fire a special kind of festering resentment that can last a lifetime, evident in snide jibes and accusations of elitism. That people feel this strongly is nothing to do with latent prejudices and the old school tie; it is because Oxford and Cambridge are internationally renowned as centres of excellence, a reputation they maintain by being discerning in their admissions - and no one likes to be told they are not good enough. 'It is a scandal that Laura should have to go and study in the States,' her headmaster said. Well, of course, she doesn't have to at all. She had other offers, and there are some very good departments of medicine at other British universities, many of them better equipped than Oxford's; in one sentence, he sweepingly dismissed them all. But for Laura, not even the thrill of a scholarship to Harvard has been enough to take the sting out of being turned down by Oxford. Get over it, Laura. Oxbridge places are competitive, and always have been. Last year my brother - who, like me, went to a comprehensive - was rejected by Oxford. Like all Oxbridge applicants, including Laura, he is academically outstanding, but instead of bleating that he was a victim of snobbery, he was big enough to admit that maybe he just hadn't done too well in his interview. Determined not to be beaten, though, he worked hard, tried again this year and was offered a place. The truth is that Laura Spence is not unusual; she is clearly bright, but if she'd done her research, she would have known that brandishing a few grade-A passes does not give you a God-given right to Oxbridge entrance, whatever your background. Nor does it mean you necessarily have the qualities to make the best contribution to college life.

With another, of course, on those who did it while they were still at school. Love bugs, geek gadgets, pop portals - no Channel 4 late-night show ever boasted such a hip-hopping array. 'Site for wannabe single mothers'? Yes, your swinging Daily Telegraph found it for you first. Charlie Moore flogs sex without shame. </p> <p>Well... actually not, of course.

So, what is all this frenzied dotcommery, now enshrined in a 12-page separate section, intended to achieve? </p> <p>Hard question: easy answer. The Telegraph wants more young readers and the net advertising they bring with them. Young readers are (conventionally) a paper's future: ads pay Mr Conrad Black's present bills. And the same Mr Black, remember, has lately concluded that his Hollinger share price has suffered too much for lack of an internet profile. He's putting his small-town Canadian papers up for sale to finance the shift. Who can say who will own the dotcom.telegraph next? </p> <p>Yet there is another, less conventional, factor at work here. You sense it when a youthful William Hague suddenly discovers the wonder of fat pension rises. Young readers may remain the audience that advertisers lust after most: but there will be far fewer of them around in the grey recesses of this 21st century. That shrinkage, ironically enough, may already be part of the Telegraph's dogged success. </p> <p>Here, along the age range, are a few uncomfortable facts for followers of old Moore: 28 per cent of his readers - on the year-end NRS research - are over 65 now (as compared with 13 per cent of the Guardian's and 15 per cent of the Times's ). Add in those over 55 (another 18 per cent) and the Telegraph's readership becomes the creakiest in Fleet Street. </p> <p>In April 1975 it sold 1.35 million copies; last month it sold 1.04 million (while both Guardian and Times were substantially up on a quarter-century ago). Where have all the buyers gone? To the graveyard, every one. The doughty modernising efforts of Max Hastings and, to be fair, Charles Moore haven't managed to shift that fatal profile. </p> <p>With it go a further stack of nasty comparisons. Only 7 per cent of Telegraph readers are ABC1s between 15 and 24 (as opposed to 12 per cent for the Times ). Only 27 per cent of Telegraph readers are ABC1s who were educated to the age of 21 (as opposed to 48 per cent for the Guardian ). The Times has 627,000 readers under the age of 45 in full-time work: the Telegraph , for all its circulation lead, can boast a mere 560,000. The Guardian , which sells just under 400,000, has more well-educated professional readers under 45 (293,000) than the Telegraph (264,000) with its million-plus sale. </p> <p>Such statistics, naturally, take their internet toll. More Times readers (1.046 million) than Telegraph readers (1.036 million) claim to have accessed the internet in the past 12 months. The Times has a clear lead among all full-time workers here. The Guardian and Telegraph are dead level among educated, professional web surfers. Something clearly needs to be done, and 12 pages of schoolkid dotcom millionaires would seem to be it. </p> <p>But there is - crucially - another way of looking at the picture. Fleet Street has been waiting for years for the Telegraph's crude circulation figure to dip below the supposedly magical million mark. That was an aim in the Eighties as Telegraph defectors founded the Independent and in the Nineties as Rupert Murdoch slashed the cover price of the Times. And yet it hasn't happened. Indeed, the Telegraph's circulation last month was almost where it stood in April 1996. This tall timber stubbornly declines to fall. </p> <p>Some of that, to be sure, can be attributed to the cosmetic surgery of subscription schemes, bulks and discounts. Nearly 400,000 copies go that way. Yet there are other, more complex, attributes in play. </p> <p>One is the sheer, walloping strength of the Telegraph's Saturday package (set 2,791,000 readers against the Independent's 616,000) which also titillates the age profile at the margins. Yet, perversely, that profile may eventually be coming to the rescue, too. For the flipside of an ageing population could be that the paper that is strongest among the over-55s is also strongest in the biggest area for future growth. </p> <p>Pensioner power isn't some notional concept. It wins local elections for William Hague. It scares Tony Blair rigid. Britain's population is shrinking, not growing. Fewer births: longer lives. The average western European was 29 years old in 1950. By 2050, on UN-monitored trends, that person will be nearly 48 - politically more conservative and wanting to call the tune. </p> <p>If newspapers are going to die as the net sweeps on, the last to go will be the ones who serve the non-electronic generations.

Tourism Concern, the ethical travel pressure group, and the Burma Campaign UK launched its boycott by dumping 'unwanted' Lonely Planet guides at the company's London offices. But speaking from his base in Melbourne, Australia, Wheeler said: 'This campaign actually makes me more determined. I am not going to be told by anyone what I can publish.' </p> <p>The boycott call highlights the ethical debate about travelling to countries with repressive regimes. Tourism Concern identifies Burma as a 'rare but clear example' of a country that should not be visited by tourists. It points to direct links between the development of tourism and the widespread use of forced labour for public sector works. Tourism income sustains a brutal military regime, it says, and the elected leaders, under house arrest, have pleaded with tourists to stay away. </p> <p>Wheeler agrees that it is a 'nasty government' but a two-page introduction to the disputed guide questions whether all opposition politicians are against travel and suggests that it is possible to support non-government sponsored tourism by staying at privately owned hotels and using public transport. </p> <p>Tourism Concern's campaign quotes the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who said in January 1999: 'Guide book writers should listen to their consciences and be honest about their motivations. Profit is clearly their agenda.' Wheeler said: 'This is not an important book for us, it was pushed to the back of the pile before we published it in January. But just as an encyclopedia must cover the world, whatever the regime, I am not going to leave a gap.' </p> <p>The debate about boycotting oppressive regimes has always raised difficult questions. There is a point when the positive effects of travel - the spread of ideas as well as the economic benefits - are outweighed by the sheer brutality of the regime. Many, including The Observer , drew that line on South Africa during apartheid. But should we stay away from China because of the suppression of human rights in Tibet? Escape carried a cover feature on Beijing earlier this year. Was it sufficient that we recorded the human rights abuses? </p> <p>There is a solid liberal argument that the traveller - and the reader - should be allowed to make up his or her own mind. There is something disturbing about a boycott of a series of guide books, whatever offence one particular title might cause. </p> <p>It is not possible to publish guide books without causing offence. Wheeler points to the difficulty of publishing maps of the India-Pakistan border and recalls how the Lonely Planet Malawi guide would be seized at the border by officials of the Hastings Banda regime. </p> <p>For the record, on Escape we respect Aung San Suu Kyi's call not to visit her country and would not write about Burma as a tourist destination. But we will not be burning any books either.</p>",

Tourism Concern, the ethical travel pressure group, and the Burma Campaign UK launched its boycott by dumping 'unwanted' Lonely Planet guides at the company's London offices. But speaking from his base in Melbourne, Australia, Wheeler said: 'This campaign actually makes me more determined. I am not going to be told by anyone what I can publish.' The boycott call highlights the ethical debate about travelling to countries with repressive regimes. Tourism Concern identifies Burma as a 'rare but clear example' of a country that should not be visited by tourists. It points to direct links between the development of tourism and the widespread use of forced labour for public sector works. Tourism income sustains a brutal military regime, it says, and the elected leaders, under house arrest, have pleaded with tourists to stay away. Wheeler agrees that it is a 'nasty government' but a two-page introduction to the disputed guide questions whether all opposition politicians are against travel and suggests that it is possible to support non-government sponsored tourism by staying at privately owned hotels and using public transport. Tourism Concern's campaign quotes the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who said in January 1999: 'Guide book writers should listen to their consciences and be honest about their motivations. Profit is clearly their agenda.' Wheeler said: 'This is not an important book for us, it was pushed to the back of the pile before we published it in January. But just as an encyclopedia must cover the world, whatever the regime, I am not going to leave a gap.' The debate about boycotting oppressive regimes has always raised difficult questions. There is a point when the positive effects of travel - the spread of ideas as well as the economic benefits - are outweighed by the sheer brutality of the regime. Many, including The Observer , drew that line on South Africa during apartheid. But should we stay away from China because of the suppression of human rights in Tibet? Escape carried a cover feature on Beijing earlier this year. Was it sufficient that we recorded the human rights abuses? There is a solid liberal argument that the traveller - and the reader - should be allowed to make up his or her own mind. There is something disturbing about a boycott of a series of guide books, whatever offence one particular title might cause. It is not possible to publish guide books without causing offence. Wheeler points to the difficulty of publishing maps of the India-Pakistan border and recalls how the Lonely Planet Malawi guide would be seized at the border by officials of the Hastings Banda regime. For the record, on Escape we respect Aung San Suu Kyi's call not to visit her country and would not write about Burma as a tourist destination. But we will not be burning any books either.",

Tools were downed and the massive spindle jibs of the cranes finally came to rest. The Sunday before, three of their colleagues - Martin Burgess, 31, Peter Clark, 33, and Michael Whittard, 39 - were killed when the crane they were erecting collapsed. Now it was time to observe a minute's silence. </p> <p>It is very likely that the workers paying their respects last week used the time to remember other friends and colleagues in the building trade who have also died as a result of how they made their living. Britain's construction industry is second only to mining for the number of lives it claims each year. </p> <p>Between March 1998 and March 1999 - a good year as it happens - 70 people were killed on British construction sites. That's the equivalent of more than two Paddington train crashes. Another 4,600 suffered major injuries, classed as limb breakages, amputations, blindings and the like. </p> <p>But perhaps even more startling than the grim casualty score card is the rarity with which anybody is ever called to account for these deaths and injuries. Between 1996 and 1998 the Health and Safety Executive, under whose remit such accidents fall, investigated just 11 per cent of major injuries. In turn only 11 per cent of those - 1 per cent of the total - resulted in a prosecution. As to deaths, only 18.8 per cent of companies were prosecuted for associated infringements of health and safety regulations. However, not a single director or manager was hauled up in the courts to answer for what had happened to their employees. </p> <p>Little can be said yet about the tragic events at Canary Wharf. Both the police and the HSE are investigating. Doubtless they will also want to look at the two other serious crane accidents which have occurred on the same Canary Wharf site over the past six weeks, fortunately with no loss of life. </p> <p>But the deaths, coming in the very same week as the launch of a Government consultation paper on a new offence of corporate killing, cannot help but concentrate our minds on the horrible risks people are forced to take simply to earn a living. </p> <p>The Government's initiative is to be welcomed. In theory it has always been possible to prosecute companies and their directors for the manslaughter of their employees, but in practical terms the definition of such a crime has been so vague that it has rarely been tried. No one was ever called to account in court for the death tolls in the 1987 King's Cross fire, or the 1988 Clapham rail crash or the 1997 Southall rail crash, even though subsequent inquiries into all three identified serious management failings right the way up the chain of command. </p> <p>The proposed changes introduce a set of specific offences which should make it far easier to get a result. The only problem lies in the small print of the consultation paper: the Law Commission is proposing that the agency responsible for investigating and prosecuting such cases should be the very same agency that has already proved itself so woefully poor at the job, namely the Health and Safety Executive. </p> <p>Why, when their record has been so dismal in the past - and in the present, for that matter - should we suddenly assume that they will be up to the new challenge? For their part the HSE argues that, were they to be given the role, the Government would also give them the necessary resources, but that would hardly address the question of their overall competence. If a brickie could not lay a straight wall you wouldn't suddenly give him the cash to build your whole house. </p> <p>The HSE also argues that their failure in the past to prosecute in manslaughter cases hasn't been their fault but that of the damn Crown Prosecution Service, which keeps throwing them out. Between 1992 and 1998, the HSE passed 59 cases to the CPS, which proceeded with 18. Only four were successful. Doesn't this suggest that something was just a little lacking in the evidence the HSE had managed to gather? What's more, isn't 59 cases - a tiny fraction of the total work-related deaths for the period - a touch unambitious? </p> <p>Then, of course, there is the more basic issue of separating investigating duties from prosecuting duties. It was long ago decided that it would be better if the task of mounting prosecutions was taken out of the hands of the police. Why should it be any different for offences arising out of health and safety legislation? The HSE refused last week to comment on the proposals but, according to sources close to the Law Commission, it was the HSE itself which lobbied to be given the job, a classic ruse by a besieged bureaucracy desperate to protect its turf. </p> <p>Of course, if the Government really wants to do something about deaths and injuries on Britain's building sites, it could have a serious go at getting employers to treat their workers decently. In an increasingly fragmented business where contractors sub-contract jobs to firms who in turn sub-contract jobs and ever onwards, profit margins are shaved so thinly that complying with either employment law or safety regulations has no place on the business plan. </p> <p>The Union of Construction and Allied Trades estimates that upwards of 50 per cent of those in the business are forced to sign on to jobs on a self-employed basis, thus sparing their employers the cost of National Insurance payments. The Working Time Directives, introduced in 1998, are designed to force firms to give even the self-employed holiday pay. But too many companies are simply ignoring the law and are challenging their employees with a stark choice between rocking the boat by taking them to an industrial tribunal or simply staying quiet. Too many choose the latter. </p> <p>This may look like the most tedious end of already tedious employment wrangles. But if there's one thing you can say with any certainty about an exhausted construction worker it's that they are a surefire safety risk. Force a builder to keep working and he runs a good chance of becoming yet another gruesome statistic. And that is something Britain's construction industry already has more than enough of. </p> <p><strong> Ken's policies ... what policies?</strong></p> <p>Anybody foolish enough to try to judge Ken Livingstone's suitability for the job of London Mayor during his campaign on the basis of his policies got what they deserved. Sure, there was stuff about congestion charging and a lot of grandstanding about the virginal purity of bonds over the sluttish improprieties of Public Private Partnerships for the funding of the Tube, but after that it was all a bit vague. </p> <p>During one session with him amid the clamour of the election, the nearest I came to a Livingstone policy pronouncement was a promise to book Enya for a concert in a London park and a proposal that the capital's citizens should take Sunday lunches by the river and then go for a nice stroll the better to improve their health. </p> <p>So I knew just how short on solid ideas the man happened to be, but I had not realised exactly how intense this policy vacuum was. Last week, amid the ecclesiastical splendour of Emmanuel Hall, the temporary home of the Greater London Assembly, the new Mayor came before the new GLA members to be interrogated for the first time. </p> <p>The questions themselves were truly the stuff of international moment: something on waste management in Sutton, the tram system in Croydon, and the placing of radio masts in both of them.

He could bore for Britain. </p> <p>Before the questions started Mr Livingstone asked to make a statement.

During the election, he said, time had been a bit constrained when it came to the tiresome business of writing a manifesto. So, now that he had been elected, he was going to get his old friend, the Labour MP John McDonnell, to undertake a major consultation exercise to come up with what he called 'a consensual strategy for a decade'.

John Pagano, the Canary Wharf Group's cheerful vice-president for construction, was pleased with the way the work was going, the layered shell of each new building now rising effortlessly about its concrete core. The two construction jobs had, he said, been given to different contractors. What, I asked, so they'll race each other to the top? 'Absolutely,' Pagano said. 'They're matching each other floor for floor at the moment.' Last Thursday the hundreds of construction workers on the site stopped competing.

In other words, if I have invited failure or gone beyond conventional wisdom. </p> <p>The tulip season is now gone, but only just, and the main thing I learnt from our tulip blitz was that you can still plant tulips in February and get good flowering in May. By the time the tulips were on the fade, the alliums were swinging in. I only really turned on to alliums at last year's Chelsea Flower Show. It is odd how you can be acquainted with a plant for years and not really get it at all; then suddenly you see one and - bing! -a light goes on and you are ravished. I realised that alliums could add a whole idiosyncratic texture and dimension to a border, with their bulky basal leaves and flowers held aloft. </p> <p>So we ordered a bunch of bulbs and planted Allium aflatunense, A. cristophii, A. giganteum, A. siculum, A. 'Purple Sensation', A. ursinum, A. schubertii and A. sphaerocephalon in our borders over the winter. In fact, we ordered what seemed to be a huge amount and they sat for weeks in the potting shed under fleece to stop them from freezing, while we wondered what the bloody hell we were going to do with them. But six months later, I wish we had ordered twice as many. </p> <p>The first out were the tall drumsticks of A. aflatunense . These are about 2ft to 3ft tall with lilac flowers fringed with a silvery halo. As they emerge, the colour showing through the thin tissue of sheath, they look like flat-topped thistles which then open out to a cylinder. The leaves hang slightly dejected with a kink in the middle and, on ours, burnt tips as though touched by frost or fire. </p> <p>The same is true of the leaves of A. 'Purple Sensation', while its umbels are a fabulously rich purple tinged with burgundy, the individual florets forcing out rather than hanging together within an invisible globe. We have them in the jewel garden backed by cardoons and interspersed by Cerinthe major pupurascens , and they are pitched perfectly against the grey foliage of both plants. For the first few days that they came into flower, the tulip 'Queen of Sheba' was sprawling in the throes of a regal death, contributing richly to the intensity of the scene. It's a wonderful tulip - another batch of 100 is already booked for that corner next autumn. </p> <p>Down the end of the jewel garden, in a new section dug and planted up earlier this year, we have A. sphaerocephalon , which so far are just wispy, arching stems, like an exotic grass. They are translated as 'round-headed leeks' but are more bell-shaped or thimble-headed. Joanna Crane, whom I visited all last summer for Channel 4's Real Gardens , had a couple of beds of these which looked very good in her garden. I particularly liked the patchwork of pinks, mauves and lilacs that they made, looking rather like a pleasantly faded tapestry. If they don't look the business in our garden I shall hold her entirely responsible. </p> <p>A few yards round the corner, but miles away in style and form, is A. schubertii on either side of a path. This has a whopping great flower ball and fat, wavy leaves. At the moment it is a dumpy, bull-necked thing. Despite having all the appearance of a front-row forward, it is not fully hardy and I must remember to protect it with a mulch of straw before the first frosts. </p> <p>In the artichoke walk, the A. giganteums are not yet out. To set the scene, the walk is a narrow path, some 30 yards long and 2ft wide. There is a 5ft bed flanking either side, filled with artichokes, cardoons and, all spring, by the wallflower Erysimum cheiri 'Blood Red' which is now all but over and fading to a russet - just like dried blood. Behind the beds are hornbeam hedges and above them pleached limes. The allium stems are fully 4ft tall and will grow to 6ft or more, topped by tight, pointed minarets, rising with straight and glabrous stems. They have the most wonderful leaves, arching out in great glaucous, smoky straps from the centre, like bromeliads - which we all know are uniformly hideous - transformed and made beautiful. It would be enough to grow them for the leaves alone. I see that the RHS encyclopedia says they 'wither before flowering'. I do hope not, but if they are going to they had better start withering quick because by the time you read this and I return from my stint at Chelsea the pointed turban heads will be great violet globes the size of flowery melons. </p> <p> A. ursinum were chosen for the shade of the woodland garden that is, as yet, in its early stages. These white-flowering small onions (otherwise known as ramsons or wild garlic) are native to this country. They can become intrusive, but we also have bluebells in there which are just as invasive: the two plants often grow side by side. Both are battling against couch grass, too - which will get shaded out eventually, as much by the heavy straps of the ramsons as the trees. The ramson's leaves are delicately edible and make a surprisingly subtle alternative to fresh garlic. </p> <p>Back in the walled garden A. cristophii is also poised but as yet unopened, although when it does it will be even bigger than giganteum . Unlike the afflatunense on the other side of the same bit of garden, these withhold their colour, revealing nothing yet, other than a certain intensity of tone. The leaves have little hairs along the edge: a curiously delicate feature on such a robustly constructed plant. A. cristophii is more open than many other alliums, more dandelion-like and tenuous in flower structure, although the purple stems of the florets within the umbel give it an intensity that glows from within the flower. </p> <p>And the A. siculum ? I am ashamed to say that we never got round to planting them, so we put them all into pots for the summer.</p>",

And the A. siculum ? I am ashamed to say that we never got round to planting them, so we put them all into pots for the summer.",

England scored from a long throw and Brazil equalised from a corner in a match which neither Rivaldo nor David Beckham, currently rated best and second-best footballers in the world, could raise above the mundane. </p> <p>Always one to accentuate the positive, Kevin Keegan will doubtless point out that a draw against this quality of opposition is no mean feat and that England arguably created more chances. He said the same after the goalless draw against Argentina and it is a fair point, but everyone knows Brazil can play much better than this while we are still waiting to see what Keegan's England can produce. There is certainly no disgrace in failing to beat Brazil, though most of the teams involved in play-off games at Wembley this weekend will defend routine set pieces better than England managed on the stroke of half- time. As a confidence booster, which was what Keegan said he wanted, it was only a qualified success. </p> <p>In marked contrast to the stodgy fare on offer in last week's FA Cup final, this friendly game on a much heavier pitch enjoyed the liveliest of openings. Emerson was through on goal within the first minute, as quick Brazil passing made the most of a poor clearance from David Seaman, and it needed one of Paul Ince's finest cover tackles to prevent the Leverkusen forward getting in a shot on goal. </p> <p>England recovered their composure quickly, and when Alan Shearer won a free-kick on the right David Beckham's cross picked out an unmarked Martin Keown, but his header was directed straight at Dida, a somewhat unconvincing presence in the Brazilian goal. Beckham's next free-kick from the right touchline met a much firmer response from Shearer after 15 minutes, but again Dida was not seriously extended and managed to beat the attempt away with his fists. </p> <p>In between the visitors had missed an excellent opportunity to take the lead when a weak clearing header from Gary Neville, who cannot be said to be at his most impressive against Brazilian opposition, fell handily for Rivaldo, who was lurking behind the defender in the manner perfected in the World Club Championships by Romario. Rivaldo had time and a clear sight of goal, but from 10 yards range the World Player of the Year volleyed high and wide in similar fashion to a predecessor, Chelsea's George Weah, on almost exactly the same spot seven days ago. </p> <p>A passing storm contributed special effects that were at first Wagnerian but rapidly descended into the comic, as players were blinded by driving rain and floodlights were necessary to pierce the gloom, but within minutes blue skies were prevailing again and England were continuing to give their opponents some nervous moments at back. A shot from Dennis Wise was tipped round a post by Dida after neat interpassing between the Chelsea captain and Paul Scholes, then a mix-up between the goalkeeper and Antonio Carlos obliged Emerson to clear off his line before Owen could poke the ball goalwards. Another neat touch by Scholes, this time a backheel from Ince's pass, gave Shearer an opportunity on the half hour, but though he managed his shot on the turn with something of his old elan there was no real power and Dida was able to save. </p> <p>An uncharacteristically sluggish Rivaldo missed another chance to test Seaman before England took the lead seven minutes before the interval. One of Gary Neville's long throws from the right was headed on by Beckham to the feet of Shearer, who - though unable to shoot himself - did the next best thing by finding Owen in space with a short pass. It took out three fairly static defenders with Owen already facing goal and with a clearer sight of the target than Shearer. He capitalised by clipping a low shot past Dida and into the far corner. </p> <p>Owen had a much more difficult chance to put England two ahead three minutes later, when a cross from Beckham arrived at chest height. The Liverpool player went for a spectacular volley but failed to connect properly, though at least his compromised effort was still on target and was certainly no worse than either of Rivaldo's attempts in the first half. Just when England thought they had completed a satisfactory first period, however, Brazil caught them ball-watching in the final minute of added time. </p> <p>A deep cross by Silvinho from the left was only diverted from Amoroso at the expense of a corner, and when Rivaldo swung over another deep cross England were dismayed to find they had neglected to put a man on Franca at the far post. The 24 year old Sao Paulo striker scored with the simplest of headers, leaving England to reflect that defending set pieces is a basic necessity, even against a team more famous for exhilarating attacks. </p> <p>After both sides spurned early second-half chances, England replaced Ince with Ray Parlour in what was presumably an attempt to signal a greater commitment to attack, though it was noticeable that Wise was eclipsing Scholes as the most inventive midfielder. Despite the promise suggested by their combination for the opening goal there was no real evidence of partnership between Owen and Shearer. </p> <p>The former saw more of the ball, without managing to cause Brazil's defence any further problems, while Shearer looked a little happier than of late, but must be worried about where his service is going to come from in Euro 2000, let alone his goals. Shearer made way for Robbie Fowler seven minutes from the end, but of course that was too little time to make any discernable difference. </p> <p>The crowd had to be reminded to applaud the teams from the pitch at the end, and the overall impression was of an opportunity missed by both teams. Keegan will not have learned much more from this than he knew already.</p>",

This was the statue of the late Major Saad Haddad, the first commander of the South Lebanese Army (SLA). With such restraint, the Hizbollah disproved all forecasts that 'the Israeli agents' would be 'slaughtered in their beds.' Even the jailers at the notorious Khiam prison were permitted to escape to Israel. There have been no reports of revenge killings, or brutality of any kind.

'I think,' said a Sunni Muslim, 'that in this combination - Hizbollah's good conduct and a further revelation of the true nature of Israel's involvement in Lebanon, selfish and opportunistic to the end - the education of our Christian compatriots is complete. We Lebanese are, and must be, closer to each other than we are to any outsider.'</p> <p>It has been a besetting sin of this country of myriad faiths and sects for one or more of them to seek dominance over, or redress against, others by turning to outside sponsors. In the Seventies, the militant Christians turned to Israel in their struggle against the Palestinian guerrillas then implanted in Lebanon and their Muslim-leftist Lebanese allies.</p> <p>The long Lebanese ordeal - composed of both all-out war and civil war - had its roots in the South, and in the reprisals which Palestinian guerrilla incursions into northern Israel brought down on the local population. Is it now, at long last, about to end there?</p> <p>Lebanon is now whole again physically. That is unquestionably Hizbollah's doing. Ironically, it was because Lebanon was the weakest of all Arab states that they managed it.</p> <p>'Our country', said a secular nationalist, 'is a like supermarket. You can find anything in it. Some say we are just a bordello, and we are, but in our chaotic freedom we are also capable of throwing up the very antithesis of that - a self-sacrificing body of men like Hizbollah. No other Arab state, with its oppressive dictatorships, could have done it.'</p> <p>From small beginnings Hizbollah grew into the most formidable fighting force Israel has ever faced. Its triumph is already having a psychologicial impact on Arabs everywhere, not least in Palestine, where it is arousing the 'street' and making Yasser Arafat's 'realistic' school of diplomacy look more futile and subservient than ever.</p> <p>The question is to what extent Lebanon is now not merely physically, but psychologically, whole. Hizbollah, with its exemplary behaviour, has struck a powerful blow for that too. What could have led to a renewal of civil war has provoked the opposite: a greater sense of common pride and belonging, transcending all the sects, than anyone can remember. But will its behaviour remain exemplary? 'Victors' in this civil war always grew arrogant - and this is the greatest victory of all.</p> <p>What the overwhelming majority of Lebanese want is a permanent end to the southern war, with all its pernicious consequences, economic and political, domestic and external. They want it all the more badly because they know too well the disastrous consequences of failing to end it now. The Israelis have made it clear repeatedly that from now on 'the rules' of Lebanese warfare will change; their response to any cross-frontier raids will become more 'painful' than ever, and take in Syrian as well as Lebanese targets.</p> <p>For most Lebanese the way to end the war is for 'the Islamic resistance,' its job done, to put aside arms and reap the reward of its military prowess in domestic politics. The Lebanese state must become strong again, and show its strength first by restoring its authority over the newly recovered South. The desire for that is felt most strongly by the Christians, particularly the Maronites, who always relied on the state as the guarantor of a pluralist system that guarantees their distinctive identity in an overwhelmingly Muslim environment.</p> <p>But all other religious communities share that sentiment. And that includes the Shi'ites, Hizbollah's natural constituency, and especially the Shi'ites of the south. It is hard to imagine after all the scenes of joyous southerners returning to homes that some have not seen for a quarter century, but they would look on any Hizbollah decision to continue the 'armed struggle' with dismay.</p> <p>The main obstacles to the restoration of state authority comes from two, inter-related quarters. One is Hizbollah's militant Islamic ideology.</p> <p>As Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah put it recently, Israel is an 'imposed, usurping, illegitimate state', and it is the right and duty of Muslims to combat it. However, he judiciously added: 'Whether we fight beyond Lebanese borders we shall decide after liberation.' So, ideologically, decision time is now.</p> <p>The other is the Lebanese tendency to serve outside powers at their own expense. Now that means Syria above all. For Syria, southern Lebanon and the pain which Hizbollah has inflicted there, has been a key to its diplomatic efforts to secure an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. It is a clearly in Syria's interest that Hizbollah should have a pretext to continue inflicting that pain, despite the withdrawal.</p> <p>This is why, the Lebanese believe, their government suddenly began to insist that Israel should leave the 'Shebaa farms' territory in which it had hitherto taken no interest. It is also why Hizbollah hints that it will continue the armed struggle until it does go. It is decision time here too.</p> <p>It is not yet clear which way Hizbollah will move. But if it responds to what most of the people want - and, privately, this is what the government wants too - it will have made a critical shift from its devotion to radical Islamic ideology and serving foreign powers to a Lebanese identity and purpose.</p> <p>Nasrallah's speech yesterday pointed in that direction. Hizbollah would indeed be 'modest' in victory. Nothing would do more to make Lebanon whole again and, if Syria succumbs to anticipated pressure to withdraw from Lebanon, independent too.</p> <p>Two hundred SLA members, who surrendered as the Israelis left, are to be tried for collaborating with the enemy, the Lebanese army said.</p>",

Some say we are just a bordello, and we are, but in our chaotic freedom we are also capable of throwing up the very antithesis of that - a self-sacrificing body of men like Hizbollah. No other Arab state, with its oppressive dictatorships, could have done it.' From small beginnings Hizbollah grew into the most formidable fighting force Israel has ever faced. Its triumph is already having a psychologicial impact on Arabs everywhere, not least in Palestine, where it is arousing the 'street' and making Yasser Arafat's 'realistic' school of diplomacy look more futile and subservient than ever. The question is to what extent Lebanon is now not merely physically, but psychologically, whole. Hizbollah, with its exemplary behaviour, has struck a powerful blow for that too. What could have led to a renewal of civil war has provoked the opposite: a greater sense of common pride and belonging, transcending all the sects, than anyone can remember. But will its behaviour remain exemplary? 'Victors' in this civil war always grew arrogant - and this is the greatest victory of all. What the overwhelming majority of Lebanese want is a permanent end to the southern war, with all its pernicious consequences, economic and political, domestic and external. They want it all the more badly because they know too well the disastrous consequences of failing to end it now. The Israelis have made it clear repeatedly that from now on 'the rules' of Lebanese warfare will change; their response to any cross-frontier raids will become more 'painful' than ever, and take in Syrian as well as Lebanese targets. For most Lebanese the way to end the war is for 'the Islamic resistance,' its job done, to put aside arms and reap the reward of its military prowess in domestic politics. The Lebanese state must become strong again, and show its strength first by restoring its authority over the newly recovered South. The desire for that is felt most strongly by the Christians, particularly the Maronites, who always relied on the state as the guarantor of a pluralist system that guarantees their distinctive identity in an overwhelmingly Muslim environment. But all other religious communities share that sentiment. And that includes the Shi'ites, Hizbollah's natural constituency, and especially the Shi'ites of the south. It is hard to imagine after all the scenes of joyous southerners returning to homes that some have not seen for a quarter century, but they would look on any Hizbollah decision to continue the 'armed struggle' with dismay. The main obstacles to the restoration of state authority comes from two, inter-related quarters. One is Hizbollah's militant Islamic ideology. As Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah put it recently, Israel is an 'imposed, usurping, illegitimate state', and it is the right and duty of Muslims to combat it. However, he judiciously added: 'Whether we fight beyond Lebanese borders we shall decide after liberation.' So, ideologically, decision time is now. The other is the Lebanese tendency to serve outside powers at their own expense. Now that means Syria above all. For Syria, southern Lebanon and the pain which Hizbollah has inflicted there, has been a key to its diplomatic efforts to secure an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. It is a clearly in Syria's interest that Hizbollah should have a pretext to continue inflicting that pain, despite the withdrawal. This is why, the Lebanese believe, their government suddenly began to insist that Israel should leave the 'Shebaa farms' territory in which it had hitherto taken no interest. It is also why Hizbollah hints that it will continue the armed struggle until it does go. It is decision time here too. It is not yet clear which way Hizbollah will move. But if it responds to what most of the people want - and, privately, this is what the government wants too - it will have made a critical shift from its devotion to radical Islamic ideology and serving foreign powers to a Lebanese identity and purpose. Nasrallah's speech yesterday pointed in that direction. Hizbollah would indeed be 'modest' in victory. Nothing would do more to make Lebanon whole again and, if Syria succumbs to anticipated pressure to withdraw from Lebanon, independent too. Two hundred SLA members, who surrendered as the Israelis left, are to be tried for collaborating with the enemy, the Lebanese army said.",

      "bodyText": "David Trimble rescued the Northern Ireland peace process from the brink of disaster yesterday. He pulled off an historic political coup by persuading the Ulster Unionist Party to return to the power-sharing Executive. A week after Trimble's attempts to get his party to back the new peace deal appeared doomed to failure, the Unionist leader just managed to persuade enough members of the party's ruling council to back the deal to save the Good Friday Agreement. But tensions immediately emerged following a day of high drama. In a controversial statement, he said he believed Sinn Fein members still needed to be 'house-trained' before they could become bona fide democrats. This remark is likely to cause widespread anger throughout the republican movement. Asked by reporters if his term 'housetrained' compared Sinn Fein to dogs, Trimble retorted: 'That's your language, not mine.' After the highly charged meeting yesterday morning, the council eventually voted by 459 votes to 403 to accept the deal. Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, who had personally staked his reputation on the resumption of the Northern Ireland Assembly, immediately signed papers to allow the Executive, including two Sinn Fein Ministers, to meet again on Tuesday. The whole assembly will meet for the first time since it was suspended by Mandelson in January. 'No one who has witnessed the last week will underestimate the effort and commitment David Trimble has shown,' Mandelson said. 'At the same time I want to recognise how difficult many Unionists will have found it coming to this decision.' Bertie Ahern, the Irish Prime Minister, welcomed the deal but said that the closeness of the result - 53 per cent to 47 per cent - was a concern. 'Of course, there is a lot of concern,' Ahern admitted. 'It would be far nicer if the 47 per cent was instead 7 per cent. 'It is now time for everyone definitively to seize this opportunity for a shared future of peace, partnership and prosperity. 'I believe that this time the Assembly is back for good. That is certainly what we want to see.' Ahern said the IRA must now stick to its agreement from earlier this month to put its guns 'beyond use'. 'I hope they will implement it as quickly as possible, within a matter of weeks, as they agreed,' he said. Shortly after the result was announced, Trimble issued a warning that his party could walk out of the Executive if the IRA failed to deliver on its promises to open arms dumps for inspection and put their weapons of war beyond use. The jaded-looking UUP leader acknowledged that the vote had been extremely close and that the party had stretched itself to breaking point. 'There is a limit to how far we can stretch ourselves without an adequate response being made by the IRA,' he said. 'The republican movement has promised to put a confi dence building measure in place within a matter of weeks. 'Two weeks have already gone since that promise was made, I expect that promise to be delivered fairly soon now. If there is any foot-dragging, there will be difficulties.' On 6 May the IRA broke the deadlock in the peace process by offering to put its arms beyond use and open up its weapons dumps for full inspection by independent observers from South Africa and Finland. Flanked by his wife Daphne and the UUP president Josias Cunningham, Trimble thanked his deputy, John Taylor, for his eleventh-hour support which had been 'enormously helpful'. The deputy leader weighed in to support Trimble yester day morning following his return from a week-long tour of the Far East. Taylor had initially said he could not support the deal. Despite the knife-edge narrowness of the result, opponents of the Good Friday Agreement appeared to be deeply shaken by their last-minute defeat. The UUP anti-Agreement faction had fought a sophisticated campaign over the last fortnight to persuade delegates to reject re-entering a coalition with Sinn Fein. Speaking after the meeting while extremist loyalist protesters hurled abuse at Trimble and his entourage, Roy Beggs Jnr, the Assembly member for East Antrim, said he was still deeply sceptical. 'They say there is no alternative to this deal. Does that mean that if the deal is not accepted, the IRA will go back to war again? That's blackmail and I cannot support it,' he said.",

Both Radio Two and Radio Three, stations with a much older audience profile, are moving in on the world music scene. </p> <p>Radio Three will broadcast live from this year's Womad festival for the first time in July and its new late-night world music show, Late Junction , has earned praise from critics and comparatively large listening figures.</p>",

'We don't want to serve a dwindling audience - although we never say you are not welcome if you want to keep in touch.' Parfitt admits there are increased sales for world music and that Kershaw's show had audience ratings 'to be expected for that type of programme at that time'. But he said his station needs a balance of fresh artists and DJs. 'It is really about there being a limit in schedules as to what you can do,' he said. Thomas Brooman, the artistic director of Womad, fears that young people will no longer come across a variety of music on the radio. 'Andy Kershaw's abandonment makes it look as if Radio One is closing itself off into even more of a narrow vein,' he said. 'They seem to think audiences want a diet of machine-driven dance music. It is as if they want to deny the existence of world music.' BBC broadcaster and pro ducer John Walters, Kershaw's long-term mentor, appears to suspect that young people are being shortchanged. 'We have come a long way from the days when Lord Reith was asked, \"Are you going to give the people what they want?\" and replied, \"No. Something better than that,\"' he said. The BBC claims that this 'something better' can now be found on other stations. Both Radio Two and Radio Three, stations with a much older audience profile, are moving in on the world music scene. Radio Three will broadcast live from this year's Womad festival for the first time in July and its new late-night world music show, Late Junction , has earned praise from critics and comparatively large listening figures.",

It's about murder, cover-up and collusion between British intelligence and the loyalist paramilitaries, and comes closest to confirming the republicans' perennial charge that the British state was complicit in murder and adept at hiding it.</p> <p>Nelson, a former British soldier from the Shankill Road, was a British agent operating as the intelligence chief of the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Defence Association (UDA), providing the vital intelligence that guided its killers to their targets. He was directed to do so by the secret army unit for which he worked known as the Force Research Unit - the FRU.</p> <p>The FRU recruited and handled agents. Its crest is a man with a net - its motto 'Fishers of Men'. Astonishingly, the FRU helped Nelson with the intelligence he handed on to the killers. It's a shocking story straight out of the pages of a fantasy thriller but it's true, confirmed in a remarkable interview with 'Geoff', one of Nelson's handlers, for our BBC2 series, Brits ..</p> <p>Tracking him down took months. When it comes to covert operations, the MoD's doors are double-locked and bolted. Geoff admits that Nelson 'strayed outside the law at our behest' and feels disgusted that when his activities came to light, he was 'hung out to dry' by the Establishment. He's the first Nelson handler to break his silence. The implications of what he says and the questions raised by it are massive.</p> <p>The killing of Gerard Slane on 22 September 1988 sheds chilling light on how Nelson operated and shows how fine was the line the FRU trod. Just after 4am, four masked gunman from the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), the UDA's killer wing, sledgehammered their way into the Slane's house off the Falls Road, and shot Gerard four times in the head. They claimed that he'd been involved in the killing of one of their own a fortnight earlier. An RUC detective said there was nothing to suggest that he had.</p> <p>The last words his wife heard were Gerard screaming, 'Teresa, it's the Orangies!' She rushed out onto the landing and saw her husband lying dead. 'He was completely covered in blood. I actually saw a pin-hole in the side of his head and blood coming out through his nose and mouth. Blood was all over the wall.'</p> <p>Brian Nelson had provided the UFF with the detailed intelligence that had enabled the 'hit' to go ahead. He had found Slane's address, checked it in the electoral register, got hold of a photograph and made out a personal file on him - all with the blessing of the FRU.</p> <p>'Brian Nelson may not have pulled the trigger,' Teresa told me, 'but to me he was as guilty of my husband's murder as the actual murderers themselves.' Nelson was finally unmasked as an army agent involved in murder in 1990 after John Stevens, then the Deputy Chief Constable of Cambridgeshire, investigated collusion between the security forces and the loyalist paramilitaries. Nelson pleaded guilty on five counts of conspiracy to murder - Gerard Slane was one - and sentenced to 10 years. But these charges were suspected to be only the tip of an iceberg of conspiracy and killing that involved Nelson, the FRU and British intelligence.</p> <p>Geoff first met Brian Nelson at the beginning of 1987. 'He seemed quite a nice person. A family man. He told me he hated violence and he didn't agree with the way in which loyalists were carrying out their attacks. He saw himself as the spear-point in the thrust against terrorism.' That's why in the early 1980s, Nelson had originally offered his services the FRU and became the UDA's intelligence chief in West Belfast. After two years, he decided to quit and went to work in Germany.</p> <p>While he was away, loyalist killings dramatically increased from four in 1985 to fifteen in 1986. Most of the victims were innocent Catholics. At the beginning of 1987, the FRU decided to bring him back, re-recruit him and infiltrate him back inside the UDA.</p> <p>Apparently M15 was against the idea and believed that Nelson should be left where he was. Army intelligence felt differently. Nelson was given a code-name - Agent 6137.</p> <p>Geoff became his co-handler and was responsible for his resettlement in Belfast. 'We brought his family back into this dangerous job, paid the deposit on a house and car and set him up in a taxi firm. We paid him a salary of \u00a3100 a month in cash to do this job specifically for us. At the time there was a lack of information coming in from the loyalist side and we needed someone to give us that information. They were just killing people and they didn't care who they were. To me Brian Nelson was a patriot doing an extraordinary job.'</p> <p>Nelson rose to become the UDA's intelligence chief for the whole of the province. His orders from the FRU were to encourage the UFF to stop killing innocent Catholics and concentrate its murderous energies on targeting suspected republican terrorists. The FRU helped Nelson with the intelligence to carry out the killings, showing him how to collate all his information. It was na\u00efve of army intelligence to imagine that Nelson could carry out his mission without becoming involved in conspiracies to murder and even in murder itself. To do otherwise would mean his life expectancy would be short in such a dangerous double game.</p> <p>Theoretically, the FRU encouraged Nelson to focus the UFF's targeting on IRA suspects so it could save lives, the idea being that once it was known that an attack was due to take place, the target could be warned, or steps taken to prevent it.</p> <p>This is how the chain was supposed to work. Nelson would warn Geoff: Geoff would alert his superiors; the FRU would then alert the RUC's Tasking and Coordinating Group (TCG) that comprises all the intelligence agencies from Special Branch to M15. They then would decide what, if any, action to take.</p> <p>On some occasions the system worked as intended and lives were saved. On many others it did not and lives were lost, sometimes by mistake. But when Nelson passed on information to his handlers, it wasn't always acted upon. In the case of Gerard Slane, Nelson warned one of Geoff's successors on two occasions that Slane was being targeted, 10 days before the attack and finally the day before the attack itself. Teresa Slane knew nothing of it. She had no warning visit from the RUC and no attempt was made to thwart it. 'My husband might have been here today were it not for the RUC,' she says bitterly.</p> <p>But there's no evidence that the RUC ever knew about it. So what happened to the information? Did it get beyond the FRU? Was it sanitised somewhere up the chain? Was a decision taken to let the killers go ahead? Or was the information simply not precise enough? There are many questions still to be answered, not least why the killers themselves, whose identities Nelson knew, were not arrested and stopped.</p> <p>But Nelson didn't always pass on the information. Those who came to know him said he also had a passionate hatred for the IRA and a 'psychopathic tendency'. This may have inclined him to act on his own as well as with the encouragement of the FRU.</p> <p>Geoff claims Nelson did much of the intelligence work himself and had to do so to maintain his own credibility with the UFF. 'He constantly asked me for information - to check out a car number plate or an address. As a rule I used to say to him, 'It's better that you collect this information yourself because you have to be seen to be doing this job. You can't just disappear and come back with it in a day or two\".</p> <p>Geoff was aware that people would get suspicious and his agent's life was on the line every day. But did Geoff personally ever supply him with information? 'No, not directly. But if he said, 'is that so-and-so's registration, I would say to him, \"you don't have that wrong\".</p> <p>It was the beginning of the slippery slope. If that was the case, I asked, and the car owner was killed, weren't he and the FRU complicit in murder? Geoff was matter of fact. 'Well, it's a fine line you walk,' he said. I pointed out that in the end Nelson went to jail for conspiracies to murder. 'Yes,' he replied, 'at our request.' Encouraged by him and his colleagues? 'Yes'. And by the FRU? 'Yes'. And by British intelligence? 'Yes'. As a result, I added, Nelson went to jail.</p> <p>'Yes and I'm ashamed of it. Brian believed, not that he was bullet proof, but that he had protection from us and that what he was doing, he was doing at our request and therefore he had immunity - and he didn't.' Geoff is bitter. 'He saved, in my estimation, dozens of lives. He was essential to the war effort and gave us an insight into the loyalist organisations we never had in the past - and I believe don't have now. He was the jewel in the crown. I'm ashamed at the way he's been treated by the Establishment who had used him and guided him and put him in that position. I promised Brian that the Establishment would look after him and it didn't. It let him down and I'm ashamed of that.'</p> <p>Towards the end of his time as handler, Geoff did become concerned at the way that Nelson was behaving and recommended to his superiors that he should be stood down for a while. But his report was ignored. 'I was told that he was too important and that he had to stay in place because of the information coming in was so vital.' Nelson continued to work as an agent and became involved in even more controversial killings, most prominently that of the lawyer, Pat Finucane, who, like Gerard Slane and many others, was gunned down by the UFF acting on intelligence some of which had been provided by Brian Nelson. Nelson had provided the killers with a photograph that featured Finucane leaving the court with one of his clients. This remains one of the matters still under investigation by John Stevens, now, 11 years later, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.</p> <p>But Brian Nelson's legacy did not end with his sentencing. He not only distributed his intelligence storehouse to the UFF in Belfast but to its organisation all over the province - without the knowledge or approval of his handlers.</p> <p>Likewise, dissemination didn't stop with the UFF. On several occasions Nelson copied his material and handed it over to the UFF's loyalist rivals in the UVF and Red Hand Commando. Nelson spread his net wide with the result that, should the ceasefires end, the loyalist paramilitaries still have a republican hit list provided by a British agent</p> <p>There's still one question to be asked. If, when his inquiries are finally complete, Sir John Stevens recommends prosecution of members of the FRU - or higher - on conspiracy charges, will the prosecutions go ahead? Or will they, like those in the wake of the Stalker inquiry, be conveniently buried 'in the public interest'?</p> <p>The final part of Peter Taylor's series, Brits, will be shown on BBC2 on Wednesday 31 May at 9.30 pm.</p>",

'He constantly asked me for information - to check out a car number plate or an address. As a rule I used to say to him, 'It's better that you collect this information yourself because you have to be seen to be doing this job. You can't just disappear and come back with it in a day or two\". Geoff was aware that people would get suspicious and his agent's life was on the line every day. But did Geoff personally ever supply him with information? 'No, not directly. But if he said, 'is that so-and-so's registration, I would say to him, \"you don't have that wrong\". It was the beginning of the slippery slope. If that was the case, I asked, and the car owner was killed, weren't he and the FRU complicit in murder? Geoff was matter of fact. 'Well, it's a fine line you walk,' he said. I pointed out that in the end Nelson went to jail for conspiracies to murder. 'Yes,' he replied, 'at our request.' Encouraged by him and his colleagues? 'Yes'. And by the FRU? 'Yes'. And by British intelligence? 'Yes'. As a result, I added, Nelson went to jail. 'Yes and I'm ashamed of it. Brian believed, not that he was bullet proof, but that he had protection from us and that what he was doing, he was doing at our request and therefore he had immunity - and he didn't.' Geoff is bitter. 'He saved, in my estimation, dozens of lives. He was essential to the war effort and gave us an insight into the loyalist organisations we never had in the past - and I believe don't have now. He was the jewel in the crown. I'm ashamed at the way he's been treated by the Establishment who had used him and guided him and put him in that position. I promised Brian that the Establishment would look after him and it didn't. It let him down and I'm ashamed of that.' Towards the end of his time as handler, Geoff did become concerned at the way that Nelson was behaving and recommended to his superiors that he should be stood down for a while. But his report was ignored. 'I was told that he was too important and that he had to stay in place because of the information coming in was so vital.' Nelson continued to work as an agent and became involved in even more controversial killings, most prominently that of the lawyer, Pat Finucane, who, like Gerard Slane and many others, was gunned down by the UFF acting on intelligence some of which had been provided by Brian Nelson. Nelson had provided the killers with a photograph that featured Finucane leaving the court with one of his clients. This remains one of the matters still under investigation by John Stevens, now, 11 years later, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. But Brian Nelson's legacy did not end with his sentencing. He not only distributed his intelligence storehouse to the UFF in Belfast but to its organisation all over the province - without the knowledge or approval of his handlers. Likewise, dissemination didn't stop with the UFF. On several occasions Nelson copied his material and handed it over to the UFF's loyalist rivals in the UVF and Red Hand Commando. Nelson spread his net wide with the result that, should the ceasefires end, the loyalist paramilitaries still have a republican hit list provided by a British agent There's still one question to be asked. If, when his inquiries are finally complete, Sir John Stevens recommends prosecution of members of the FRU - or higher - on conspiracy charges, will the prosecutions go ahead? Or will they, like those in the wake of the Stalker inquiry, be conveniently buried 'in the public interest'? The final part of Peter Taylor's series, Brits, will be shown on BBC2 on Wednesday 31 May at 9.30 pm.",

      "body": "<p>Towards the end of a decisive week for Ulster Unionism and the Northern Ireland peace process the phone calls from the Province to a corner of the Pacific Far East became more and more frantic.</p> <p>David Trimble and his campaign team at their headquarters in Stormont kept in contact with unionism's most famous absentee - deputy Ulster Unionist leader John Taylor. Ever since the IRA launched its historic offer to put arms beyond use and allow independent observers to inspect its weapons dumps, Taylor has been a critical figure for Trimble.</p> <p>Initially he had welcomed the IRA statement on 6 May but then appeared to backtrack and demanded further conditions from the British Government on the retention of the union flag over government buildings and the name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Taylor, the bombastic, sub-aristocratic and eternally mercurial MP for Strangford, had the potential to make or break Trimble's plan to re-enter a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein.</p> <p>If Taylor said yes to the deal then he could sway a critical band of wavering delegates to the 860-strong Ulster Unionist Council, the UUP's ruling body which met yesterday at Belfast's Waterfront Hall to ratify the proposal.</p> <p>Taylor had gone Awol, taking himself off on an Industrial Development Board sponsored trip to Japan and Taiwan apparently just when his leader needed him most. The last time Trimble had faced such a knife-edge vote, back in November when the UUC first voted to join the ill-fated three-month coalition, Taylor was also absent. In the run-up to that decision he had spent a week before the UUC meeting in Iran.</p> <p>But it now seems Taylor's latest absence actually played into the hands of the Trimble camp rather than his rivals, led by rejectionist MP and opponent of the Good Friday Agreement, Jeffrey Donaldson. 'With John out of the country at least that meant he couldn't be got at. John loves to play the knight in shining armour who rides in at the last minute to save the day. You have to make John think he's loved, that he's indispensable, that's why he holds off until the last minute,' said a Trimble aide.</p> <p>The trans-Asia telephone chats between Trimble and Taylor paid off. The UUP leader's unpredictable deputy drafted an article for yesterday's issue of the unionist daily, the Ulster Newsletter, outlining why he would vote yes on arrival back from Taiwan.</p> <p>While Taylor toured factories in Japan and Taiwan last week, Trimble toured the less exotic towns and villages of rural Protestant Ulster drumming up support for his analysis that the war was over and unionists should go back into government with their former enemies.</p> <p>In the last five days of the campaign to persuade an estimated 100 to 150 floating voters on the UUC to back him, Trimble spoke at more than 20 separate venues. At times he faced outright hostility, particularly in Lisburn, the main town in Donaldson's Lagan Valley constituency.</p> <p>On Tuesday night Democratic Unionist Party supporters had stood outside Trimble's home in Lisburn shouting and chanting abuse for two hours.</p> <p>One member of the Trimble team who travelled with him to the north-west of the Province on Thursday said the UUP leader was 'physically shaking in the car' during their journey. Whether this was due to nerves, exhaustion or a combination of both, he did not say.</p> <p>Trimble's strategy was twofold: to tour the country and talk to the UUP's constituency associations and to take the battle to where it counts in modern politics - the airwaves.</p> <p>In the previous week the anti-agreement faction of Ulster Unionism and in particularly Donaldson had set the pace. The No camp used tactics such as tele-canvassing and posted out glossy three- and four-page documents to each of the 860 delegates urging a No vote. They were advised by David Lyle, a leading PR agent in Belfast whose main business for his advertising agency McCann Erikson (until now at least) has ironically been ad campaigns for the Northern Ireland Office.</p> <p>The shock troops of the No campaign were the Young Unionists, the junior wing of the UUP who collectively sound and even dress like Tory Boy, the teenage Conservative fanatic invented by the comedian Harry Enfield. Zealous, right-wing and uncompromising, the sharp-suited Young Unionists were inflicting major damage on the Trimble camp with their highly organised tactics centred on unionist fears that Martin McGuinness, the former IRA chief-of-staff and Sinn Fein MP, was about to go back into government.</p> <p>Trimble however had some unlikely allies of his own who knew infinitely more about McGuinness and his evolution from armed struggle to pragmatic politics than the Young Unionists ever could. Sean O'Callaghan, the IRA double-killer turned police agent, agreed to come to Belfast and speak at a number of public engagements in favour of Trimble. O'Callaghan joined the IRA at 15, rising to become its southern commander. He is someone who has intimate knowledge of republican leaders like McGuinness. The ex-IRA man had a brutally frank message for the UUP.</p> <p>'I told them that I came from a republican family and had been in the IRA and yet with every fibre of my being the IRA's statement on May 6 meant that the war was over for good. I told them at every opportunity that they should back Trimble,' he said.</p> <p>It was a mantra he continued to repeat throughout the week on both local television and radio.</p> <p>Even without O'Callaghan it was clear Trimble was winning the battle of the airwaves in televised clashes with Donaldson and his arch-rival Paisley.</p> <p>Trimble's exterior opponents in Irish nationalism meanwhile kept their counsel throughout the week preferring to remain silent lest an intervention might give the No unionist camp ammunition to attack the UUP leader.</p> <p>But the Irish government is still concerned that Trimble might make entry and continued participation in a new government conditional on a fresh set of demands such as the RUC's name.</p> <p>'Any more pre-conditions from Trimble and nationalism, particularly Sinn Fein, will go bananas. This is the last throw of the dice from the Provos, they are going to withdraw their offer if there are any more pre-conditions,' a senior source in the Irish government told The Observer .</p> <p>The threat of republican violence still looms over the political process. Last Wednesday evening the Real IRA fired a mortar bomb at a British Army observation post near Crossmaglen in south Armagh. The Real IRA attack was clearly designed not only to disrupt the peace and undermine efforts to re-estab lish devolution but also put two-fingers up to the Provisionals' leadership. The Irish police acted swiftly on Thursday and Friday to curb a potential terrorist atrocit, arresting seven alleged members of the Real IRA in Dublin, Louth and Donegal, including the organisation's leader.</p> <p>Meanwhile the loyalists were also engaged in violence despite protestations that their ceasefires are intact. On Wednesday the UVF attempted to kill a man they suspect was involved in the murder of the organisation's mid-Ulster brigadier, Richard Jameson. Two days later the group responsible for Jame son's murder, the LVF, shot Martin Taylor dead in north Belfast.</p> <p>This violent backdrop only increased doubt in some UUC members' minds that the terrorist wars were far from over.</p> <p>But the final tactic of the No camp was their best to date - an alternative form of devolution with potential for power-sharing put forward by Donaldson late on Thursday evening.</p> <p>Donaldson's plan, which predicated a return to all-inclusive government on the actual destruction of IRA arms, was circulated to all 860 delegates.</p> <p>But within hours the Irish government, the SDLP and Sinn Fein were pulling the Donaldson plan apart. With one voice Irish nationalism rejected any participation in what an Irish government source described as a 'talking shop devoid of real power.' Trimble took note and pointed out that Donaldson's plan was unworkable given the hostility of nationalist parties to the idea.</p> <p>On the eve of the vote the Trimble camp were taking nothing for granted, with estimates that a narrow margin of 20 votes might be enough to win the day. Those closest to the UUP leader said he had even 'psychologically pre pared himself' for the prospect of defeat and the end of his leadership.</p> <p>But in the final hours leading up to the historic vote on Ulster's future on Saturday morning Trimble and his allies got what they were looking for - an endorsement from John Taylor.</p> <p>Taylor arrived in Belfast after the overnight flight from Taipei looking remarkably fresh and relaxed. He confimed that he would be backing his leader after all.</p> <p>'There had been problems on all fronts including the issue of the RUC's title. I am now satisfied we can support this. Things have moved.'</p> <p>Whether this means that the British Government has granted Taylor and the UUP a concession on the RUC's name remains to be seen. The Irish government is opposed to a further dilution of the Patten report, believing it will undermine the IRA's offer to put arms beyond use. Northern Ireland may have a new power-sharing government on Thursday but issues remain unresolved.</p> <p>Yesterday the 860 UUP delegates were herded into a hall where a performance of the opera Aida was being staged. The UUC members, who range from farmers on the Fermanagh border to wealthy businessmen from Belfast, were surrounded by the props of the opera including a mock pyramid and two mummy casks.</p> <p>For 80 years since the foundation of Northern Ireland the Ulster Unionist Party have resembled political mummies, frozen in time, sealed in a closed world that shut out demands for equality and rights, unable to accept change that would have allowed Catholics for feel part of the state set up after partition.</p> <p>Yesterday's narrow vote in favour of re-joining an historic coalition with Sinn Fein (459 for, 403 against) means new unionism has left behind the past of No Surrender and Not an Inch.</p> <p>Now unionism via David Trimble has re-entered history to seize control of its own destiny. As Trimble put it yesterday during his second speech at the end the three hour long debate in the Waterfront: 'Don't trust me, trust yourselves.'</p>",

Taylor, the bombastic, sub-aristocratic and eternally mercurial MP for Strangford, had the potential to make or break Trimble's plan to re-enter a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein. If Taylor said yes to the deal then he could sway a critical band of wavering delegates to the 860-strong Ulster Unionist Council, the UUP's ruling body which met yesterday at Belfast's Waterfront Hall to ratify the proposal. Taylor had gone Awol, taking himself off on an Industrial Development Board sponsored trip to Japan and Taiwan apparently just when his leader needed him most. The last time Trimble had faced such a knife-edge vote, back in November when the UUC first voted to join the ill-fated three-month coalition, Taylor was also absent. In the run-up to that decision he had spent a week before the UUC meeting in Iran. But it now seems Taylor's latest absence actually played into the hands of the Trimble camp rather than his rivals, led by rejectionist MP and opponent of the Good Friday Agreement, Jeffrey Donaldson. 'With John out of the country at least that meant he couldn't be got at. John loves to play the knight in shining armour who rides in at the last minute to save the day. You have to make John think he's loved, that he's indispensable, that's why he holds off until the last minute,' said a Trimble aide. The trans-Asia telephone chats between Trimble and Taylor paid off. The UUP leader's unpredictable deputy drafted an article for yesterday's issue of the unionist daily, the Ulster Newsletter, outlining why he would vote yes on arrival back from Taiwan. While Taylor toured factories in Japan and Taiwan last week, Trimble toured the less exotic towns and villages of rural Protestant Ulster drumming up support for his analysis that the war was over and unionists should go back into government with their former enemies. In the last five days of the campaign to persuade an estimated 100 to 150 floating voters on the UUC to back him, Trimble spoke at more than 20 separate venues. At times he faced outright hostility, particularly in Lisburn, the main town in Donaldson's Lagan Valley constituency. On Tuesday night Democratic Unionist Party supporters had stood outside Trimble's home in Lisburn shouting and chanting abuse for two hours. One member of the Trimble team who travelled with him to the north-west of the Province on Thursday said the UUP leader was 'physically shaking in the car' during their journey. Whether this was due to nerves, exhaustion or a combination of both, he did not say. Trimble's strategy was twofold: to tour the country and talk to the UUP's constituency associations and to take the battle to where it counts in modern politics - the airwaves. In the previous week the anti-agreement faction of Ulster Unionism and in particularly Donaldson had set the pace. The No camp used tactics such as tele-canvassing and posted out glossy three- and four-page documents to each of the 860 delegates urging a No vote. They were advised by David Lyle, a leading PR agent in Belfast whose main business for his advertising agency McCann Erikson (until now at least) has ironically been ad campaigns for the Northern Ireland Office. The shock troops of the No campaign were the Young Unionists, the junior wing of the UUP who collectively sound and even dress like Tory Boy, the teenage Conservative fanatic invented by the comedian Harry Enfield. Zealous, right-wing and uncompromising, the sharp-suited Young Unionists were inflicting major damage on the Trimble camp with their highly organised tactics centred on unionist fears that Martin McGuinness, the former IRA chief-of-staff and Sinn Fein MP, was about to go back into government. Trimble however had some unlikely allies of his own who knew infinitely more about McGuinness and his evolution from armed struggle to pragmatic politics than the Young Unionists ever could. Sean O'Callaghan, the IRA double-killer turned police agent, agreed to come to Belfast and speak at a number of public engagements in favour of Trimble. O'Callaghan joined the IRA at 15, rising to become its southern commander. He is someone who has intimate knowledge of republican leaders like McGuinness. The ex-IRA man had a brutally frank message for the UUP. 'I told them that I came from a republican family and had been in the IRA and yet with every fibre of my being the IRA's statement on May 6 meant that the war was over for good. I told them at every opportunity that they should back Trimble,' he said. It was a mantra he continued to repeat throughout the week on both local television and radio. Even without O'Callaghan it was clear Trimble was winning the battle of the airwaves in televised clashes with Donaldson and his arch-rival Paisley. Trimble's exterior opponents in Irish nationalism meanwhile kept their counsel throughout the week preferring to remain silent lest an intervention might give the No unionist camp ammunition to attack the UUP leader. But the Irish government is still concerned that Trimble might make entry and continued participation in a new government conditional on a fresh set of demands such as the RUC's name. 'Any more pre-conditions from Trimble and nationalism, particularly Sinn Fein, will go bananas. This is the last throw of the dice from the Provos, they are going to withdraw their offer if there are any more pre-conditions,' a senior source in the Irish government told The Observer . The threat of republican violence still looms over the political process. Last Wednesday evening the Real IRA fired a mortar bomb at a British Army observation post near Crossmaglen in south Armagh. The Real IRA attack was clearly designed not only to disrupt the peace and undermine efforts to re-estab lish devolution but also put two-fingers up to the Provisionals' leadership. The Irish police acted swiftly on Thursday and Friday to curb a potential terrorist atrocit, arresting seven alleged members of the Real IRA in Dublin, Louth and Donegal, including the organisation's leader. Meanwhile the loyalists were also engaged in violence despite protestations that their ceasefires are intact. On Wednesday the UVF attempted to kill a man they suspect was involved in the murder of the organisation's mid-Ulster brigadier, Richard Jameson. Two days later the group responsible for Jame son's murder, the LVF, shot Martin Taylor dead in north Belfast. This violent backdrop only increased doubt in some UUC members' minds that the terrorist wars were far from over. But the final tactic of the No camp was their best to date - an alternative form of devolution with potential for power-sharing put forward by Donaldson late on Thursday evening. Donaldson's plan, which predicated a return to all-inclusive government on the actual destruction of IRA arms, was circulated to all 860 delegates. But within hours the Irish government, the SDLP and Sinn Fein were pulling the Donaldson plan apart. With one voice Irish nationalism rejected any participation in what an Irish government source described as a 'talking shop devoid of real power.' Trimble took note and pointed out that Donaldson's plan was unworkable given the hostility of nationalist parties to the idea. On the eve of the vote the Trimble camp were taking nothing for granted, with estimates that a narrow margin of 20 votes might be enough to win the day. Those closest to the UUP leader said he had even 'psychologically pre pared himself' for the prospect of defeat and the end of his leadership. But in the final hours leading up to the historic vote on Ulster's future on Saturday morning Trimble and his allies got what they were looking for - an endorsement from John Taylor. Taylor arrived in Belfast after the overnight flight from Taipei looking remarkably fresh and relaxed. He confimed that he would be backing his leader after all. 'There had been problems on all fronts including the issue of the RUC's title. I am now satisfied we can support this. Things have moved.' Whether this means that the British Government has granted Taylor and the UUP a concession on the RUC's name remains to be seen. The Irish government is opposed to a further dilution of the Patten report, believing it will undermine the IRA's offer to put arms beyond use. Northern Ireland may have a new power-sharing government on Thursday but issues remain unresolved. Yesterday the 860 UUP delegates were herded into a hall where a performance of the opera Aida was being staged. The UUC members, who range from farmers on the Fermanagh border to wealthy businessmen from Belfast, were surrounded by the props of the opera including a mock pyramid and two mummy casks. For 80 years since the foundation of Northern Ireland the Ulster Unionist Party have resembled political mummies, frozen in time, sealed in a closed world that shut out demands for equality and rights, unable to accept change that would have allowed Catholics for feel part of the state set up after partition. Yesterday's narrow vote in favour of re-joining an historic coalition with Sinn Fein (459 for, 403 against) means new unionism has left behind the past of No Surrender and Not an Inch. Now unionism via David Trimble has re-entered history to seize control of its own destiny. As Trimble put it yesterday during his second speech at the end the three hour long debate in the Waterfront: 'Don't trust me, trust yourselves.'",

The rally was a crucial test of credibility for Serbia's political opposition, which has drawn fierce criticism for lacking leadership during the country's escalating crisis. In the past week, the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has ratcheted up the tension, arresting activists from the student-based resistance movement Otpor and branding its members 'terrorists', 'traitors' and 'agents of Nato'. In the wake of growing activism from the wider student body, it closed universities on Friday - making campuses no-go zones for all but those entering faculty buildings to take examinations. Details of the anti-terrorism law have not been released, but analysts fear it may allow indefinite detention, arbitrary closure of non-state media and the disarming of citizens who hold guns; effectively introducing a state of emergency. The regime will not be drawn on introducing the law, but top Socialist Party member Nikola Sainovic said last week: 'The Socialist Party believes we will be successful in the fight against terrorism and against Nato. 'The work of Otpor has a violent character, disrupts public peace and order and the security of the country - and these activities will be prevented,' he said. Otpor activist Slobodan Homen responds that it is Otpor's non-violent character that gives it popularity and strength. According to Otpor insiders, polling from Milosevic's own party shows that Otpor outstrips the ruling Socialist Party in popularity. They say that Otpor has 28 per cent of popular support and Milosevic only 14 per cent. The stakes were high for the opposition yesterday.

Track and stations that have been disused since as long ago as 1962 are likely to be revived to carry freight and commuter services. This will create extra capacity and allow high speed trains to run faster and on time. Operators will be offered cash for new trains in return for promises to improve services.

The appointment of the head of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union is part of an attempt by Ministers to face up to the controversial problem of long-term nuclear waste storage. The issue has been off the political agenda since March 1997, when plans by Nirex for a \u00a31.9 billion underground facility for geological research into nuclear waste storage at Sellafield in Cumbria were thrown out by Conservative Environment Secretary John Gummer. The Labour government has faced acute problems over what to do with highly toxic intermediate-level nuclear waste - generated when spent fuel is reprocessed. It is now stored at ground level on the Sellafield site operated by reprocessor British Nuclear Fuels, but this is not a satisfactory solution for material which will remain radioactive for hundreds of years. BNFL estimates that some 110,000 cubic metres of intermediate-level waste will be generated by 2020 if reprocessing continues at Sellafield. Last year, a House of Lords committee recommended that Parliament approve plans for a deep storage site and suggested that between 15 and 20 sites across Britain be investigated. A government green paper is due next month, but it is unlikely to recommend storage sites. Jackson believes the Gummer decision was a mistake, and says the Government now has a tough job persuading the public to accept the need for a storage site.

      "byline": "Vic Marks",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Dominic Cork will not be flicking anxiously through Teletext when the England team for Thursday's Trent Bridge Test is announced today. He knows that he's some way down the pecking order; that Andrew Caddick, Darren Gough and Ed Giddins are currently unassailable and that he has barely been mentioned for a recall this summer despite injuries to Headley, Silverwood and Mullally. Which does not mean that he is no longer desperate to play for England again. He is. But for the moment his energies can only be devoted to the less exalted task of captaining Derbyshire.</p> <p>'I don't think about playing for England all the time - I did a couple of years ago,' says Cork. 'But it has been so frustrating, knowing you're good enough yet being sidelined.' And he's right. He is one of the few English cricketers (Graham Thorpe is another) outside the England team, who has proven that he has what it takes to excel at the highest level. But he hasn't played for his country since November 1998. </p> <p>Remember the heady days of 1995. Cork began his debut Test at Lord's against the West Indies as an into-the-wind support bowler; he ended it as the charismatic strike bowler landed with the dreaded sobriquet 'the new Botham' after an astonishing haul of seven for 43 in the second innings. On to Old Trafford and he performed the hat-trick in England's second victory of the series. In his first five Tests, he had taken 26 wickets and had easily topped the bowling averages. In a month, Cork had suddenly touched heights denied the vast majority of cricketers throughout their entire careers. </p> <p>'For six months after my debut my head was swirling,' he says. 'I loved the success, of course. But it was like a blur. So many people wanted to talk to me. I remember feeling glazed; they were talking but I wasn't listening. It was so claustrophobic. My life changed so quickly. I wasn't prepared for that; I don't know how you can be. I remember driving to March in Cambridgeshire for a NatWest game straight after that Lord's debut. In the pub they were all cock-a-hoop, wanting to celebrate. But I was so drained I had to say, \"Sorry, lads, I'm exhausted\" - and took to my room.' </p> <p>Since then it has been a rollercoaster career, now stuck on 27 Test appearances. He was the leading wicket-taker in South Africa in 1995-96 and ever present when England defeated South Africa here in 1998. In between there have been some major dips, culminating in his absence from the England team since the second Test against Australia at Perth in 1998. His performances deteriorated, but, far more damaging, he was labelled a troublemaker. There were personal problems stemming from his marriage break-up and he was splashed on the front pages rather than back pages - for the wrong reasons. </p> <p>He accepts the loss of form argument. 'Because of the start I had I was an easy target, but I'm honest if I've not done it out on the field. I can put my hand up when I've failed.' His explanation for his barren spells as a bowler is bullish, though. 'Maybe I was too much of a team man. I never turned down a bowl - you can't when you're playing for England. </p> <p>'Sometimes I may have bowled too much and played through injuries. I could have been more selfish. Sometimes I tried too hard. I got greedy and tried to bowl the miracle ball too often [that's the one designed to pitch leg, hit off, but which usually ends up on the mid-wicket boundary]. But I'd say I'm more disciplined now, but still aggressive.' </p> <p>He says captaincy has helped. 'Standing at first slip for Derbyshire I can watch Matt Cassar, for example. Against Yorkshire a couple of weeks ago he bowled quickly, but he wanted to bowl quicker still. I could see that he was forgetting that rhythm was the key and told him so.' A new role here for the 28-year-old old pro, who in his England days was seldom bracketed as captaincy material. </p> <p>For example, there are a few paragraphs in David Lloyd's book. Referring to the New Zealand tour of 1997, Lloyd says: 'After an initial burst of enthusiasm, he regressed into a brooding mood and often seemed to be deliberately drawing attention to himself and his problems... If it is not one thing with Cork, it is another. I sometimes feel that his problem is cricket itself and a basic inability to handle it.' </p> <p>Cork is well aware of what has been written about him. 'Don't believe those who say \"Oh, I never read what's in the papers.\" See your name there and you're bound to read on. In the past I would have bitten back in the press and they would say: \"There he goes, moaning again.\" I now realise that that sort of stuff is going to damage me. I know I've got this tag as a troublemaker and a bad apple, but I don't deserve that.' Now he won't be drawn into a slanging match and insists: 'I'm not bitter.' </p> <p>His 'boorish behaviour' on the field was also criticised by Lloyd. Sometimes this is a question of interpretation. Against the West Indies, those histrionic appeals as he was rampaging through the middle order could be seen as a welcome sign of a new, aggressive English side that refused to be cowed by anyone. When wickets were scarcer and England were struggling, such aggression was deemed to be childish and nauseating. </p> <p>I am a different person on the field than off,' he says. 'In the middle I am aggressive, up front and I like to have a chirp. Afterwards I'll talk to anyone.' He recalls the Melbourne Test, won by England on the last Ashes tour: 'Even though I was twelfth man, I was so proud of the team; there was no jealousy. I kept scampering on to the pitch with drinks after every Aussie wicket fell, geeing up our bowlers. Even then I had a chirp at Steve Waugh.' </p> <p>But at the end of that tour he was utterly downcast. 'I wasn't picked for the one-day tournament so flew home early. When I arrived I read that I wasn't even in England's preliminary squad of 38 for the World Cup. No one had told me. That omission hurt since it obviously wasn't just a cricketing decision. It was personal.' </p> <p>Since then, leading Derbyshire has dominated his cricketing life and, of course, that has not been dull either. There was a battle within the club ending with the ousting of Harold Rhodes from the cricket committee. 'As captain I'm accountable; they can sack me if they like.

      "bodyText": "Dominic Cork will not be flicking anxiously through Teletext when the England team for Thursday's Trent Bridge Test is announced today. He knows that he's some way down the pecking order; that Andrew Caddick, Darren Gough and Ed Giddins are currently unassailable and that he has barely been mentioned for a recall this summer despite injuries to Headley, Silverwood and Mullally. Which does not mean that he is no longer desperate to play for England again. He is. But for the moment his energies can only be devoted to the less exalted task of captaining Derbyshire. 'I don't think about playing for England all the time - I did a couple of years ago,' says Cork. 'But it has been so frustrating, knowing you're good enough yet being sidelined.' And he's right. He is one of the few English cricketers (Graham Thorpe is another) outside the England team, who has proven that he has what it takes to excel at the highest level. But he hasn't played for his country since November 1998. Remember the heady days of 1995. Cork began his debut Test at Lord's against the West Indies as an into-the-wind support bowler; he ended it as the charismatic strike bowler landed with the dreaded sobriquet 'the new Botham' after an astonishing haul of seven for 43 in the second innings. On to Old Trafford and he performed the hat-trick in England's second victory of the series. In his first five Tests, he had taken 26 wickets and had easily topped the bowling averages. In a month, Cork had suddenly touched heights denied the vast majority of cricketers throughout their entire careers. 'For six months after my debut my head was swirling,' he says. 'I loved the success, of course. But it was like a blur. So many people wanted to talk to me. I remember feeling glazed; they were talking but I wasn't listening. It was so claustrophobic. My life changed so quickly. I wasn't prepared for that; I don't know how you can be. I remember driving to March in Cambridgeshire for a NatWest game straight after that Lord's debut. In the pub they were all cock-a-hoop, wanting to celebrate. But I was so drained I had to say, \"Sorry, lads, I'm exhausted\" - and took to my room.' Since then it has been a rollercoaster career, now stuck on 27 Test appearances. He was the leading wicket-taker in South Africa in 1995-96 and ever present when England defeated South Africa here in 1998. In between there have been some major dips, culminating in his absence from the England team since the second Test against Australia at Perth in 1998. His performances deteriorated, but, far more damaging, he was labelled a troublemaker. There were personal problems stemming from his marriage break-up and he was splashed on the front pages rather than back pages - for the wrong reasons. He accepts the loss of form argument. 'Because of the start I had I was an easy target, but I'm honest if I've not done it out on the field. I can put my hand up when I've failed.' His explanation for his barren spells as a bowler is bullish, though. 'Maybe I was too much of a team man. I never turned down a bowl - you can't when you're playing for England. 'Sometimes I may have bowled too much and played through injuries. I could have been more selfish. Sometimes I tried too hard. I got greedy and tried to bowl the miracle ball too often [that's the one designed to pitch leg, hit off, but which usually ends up on the mid-wicket boundary]. But I'd say I'm more disciplined now, but still aggressive.' He says captaincy has helped. 'Standing at first slip for Derbyshire I can watch Matt Cassar, for example. Against Yorkshire a couple of weeks ago he bowled quickly, but he wanted to bowl quicker still. I could see that he was forgetting that rhythm was the key and told him so.' A new role here for the 28-year-old old pro, who in his England days was seldom bracketed as captaincy material. For example, there are a few paragraphs in David Lloyd's book. Referring to the New Zealand tour of 1997, Lloyd says: 'After an initial burst of enthusiasm, he regressed into a brooding mood and often seemed to be deliberately drawing attention to himself and his problems... If it is not one thing with Cork, it is another. I sometimes feel that his problem is cricket itself and a basic inability to handle it.' Cork is well aware of what has been written about him. 'Don't believe those who say \"Oh, I never read what's in the papers.\" See your name there and you're bound to read on. In the past I would have bitten back in the press and they would say: \"There he goes, moaning again.\" I now realise that that sort of stuff is going to damage me. I know I've got this tag as a troublemaker and a bad apple, but I don't deserve that.' Now he won't be drawn into a slanging match and insists: 'I'm not bitter.' His 'boorish behaviour' on the field was also criticised by Lloyd. Sometimes this is a question of interpretation. Against the West Indies, those histrionic appeals as he was rampaging through the middle order could be seen as a welcome sign of a new, aggressive English side that refused to be cowed by anyone. When wickets were scarcer and England were struggling, such aggression was deemed to be childish and nauseating. I am a different person on the field than off,' he says. 'In the middle I am aggressive, up front and I like to have a chirp. Afterwards I'll talk to anyone.' He recalls the Melbourne Test, won by England on the last Ashes tour: 'Even though I was twelfth man, I was so proud of the team; there was no jealousy. I kept scampering on to the pitch with drinks after every Aussie wicket fell, geeing up our bowlers. Even then I had a chirp at Steve Waugh.' But at the end of that tour he was utterly downcast. 'I wasn't picked for the one-day tournament so flew home early. When I arrived I read that I wasn't even in England's preliminary squad of 38 for the World Cup. No one had told me. That omission hurt since it obviously wasn't just a cricketing decision. It was personal.' Since then, leading Derbyshire has dominated his cricketing life and, of course, that has not been dull either. There was a battle within the club ending with the ousting of Harold Rhodes from the cricket committee. 'As captain I'm accountable; they can sack me if they like. In which case, the coach and I should be able to make the key cricketing decisions.' There has also been a remarkable exodus from Derby (DeFreitas, Rollins, Blackwell, Weston and Harris all left last year) yet they survive. In his two years in charge, Derbyshire have reached a Lord's final and acquired first-division status in the Championship. He says that captaincy has matured him; that he's a better communicator now, who is less likely to bottle up his frustrations and all is tranquil on the personal front. He is also encouraged by the new England regime and their willingness to take on board so-called mavericks such as Phil Tufnell, Caddick or Giddins. And he recognises that he has to rebuild his international career via performances on the pitch rather than bleatings in the press. So when the England selectors name an unchanged side for Trent Bridge today, Cork can accept their decision. Which is a start towards his rehabilitation.",

'You know what he used to do? Jaddu [Jadeja] used to tell Azhar [Azharuddin]), \"Whatever you want me to do just tell me\".' Irani also describes Judge Chandrachud, whose inquiry concluded there was no match-fixing in India, as a 'fool'.",

The question came up last week at the Moriarty Tribunal, which is investigating the payment of large sums of money to former Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey.</p> <p>It's easier to mislay that kind of money if you are the financial controller of a large firm, accustomed to handling between IR\u00a310 and IR\u00a312 million a week. That was the explanation which Ben Dunne, who once ran Ireland's largest chain of supermarkets, offered for his lapse of memory.</p> <p>Dunne has already admitted paying close to a million pounds to help the former Taoiseach out of trouble. In 1979, when Haughey took office, he was in debt to the tune of IR\u00a3l.143m. There was concern that he could be declared bankrupt.</p> <p>Rich friends, and friends of friends, were asked to bail him out. One was Dunne.

      "bodyText": "How rich do you have to be to lose track of a million pounds? The question came up last week at the Moriarty Tribunal, which is investigating the payment of large sums of money to former Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey. It's easier to mislay that kind of money if you are the financial controller of a large firm, accustomed to handling between IR\u00a310 and IR\u00a312 million a week. That was the explanation which Ben Dunne, who once ran Ireland's largest chain of supermarkets, offered for his lapse of memory. Dunne has already admitted paying close to a million pounds to help the former Taoiseach out of trouble. In 1979, when Haughey took office, he was in debt to the tune of IR\u00a3l.143m. There was concern that he could be declared bankrupt. Rich friends, and friends of friends, were asked to bail him out. One was Dunne. He expected to pay between IR\u00a3700,000 and IR\u00a3900,000. But the tribunal has uncovered evidence that his generosity came closer to IR\u00a32m. Dunne seemed surprised. It would have been easier to remember, he told the tribunal, if the money had been paid in one go rather than 'on the drip' in sums of a few hundred thousand pounds at a time. There was the further complication that the money often travelled through a number of countries and accounts - e.g. from Hong Kong to London to the Cayman Islands and back to Dublin. Dunne's contributions to Haughey's famously extravagant life style were only the start of it. He became Taoiseach in l979. During the next 17 years he received IR\u00a38.6m in donations and loans from businessmen. These included prop erty developers, a Saudi sheikh, and a leading Irish hotelier. Counsel for the tribunal made the point that the sum of IR\u00a38.6m may be an overestimate, because some of it was almost certainly transferred between several bank accounts. It was also revealed that the total did not include Haughey's salary as a TD or Government Minister. These came in the form of cheques and were cashed at once. The public has long been fascinated by the question of how and where Haughey got his money. There was the estate just outside Dublin, the island off the coast of Kerry, the family yacht and much else besides. Even so, it was startling to hear that a 'bill-paying service' operated on his behalf dealt with invoices totalling IR\u00a31.4m in just five years between l985 and January 1991. Bertie Ahern says he finds the revelations about his predecessor's financial affairs 'deeply shocking'. Haughey, he added, had 'betrayed the ethos' of Fianna Fail. This first explicit attempt to distance himself from his ex-mentor may be too little, too late. There was a time, before the recent spate of tribunals looking into political cor ruption, when most Irish people were prepared to believe that this was confined to the so-called 'golden circle' close to Haughey. Since then we have heard of large sums paid to elected councillors to change planning decisions. A former senior official in Dublin Corporation has admitted receiving a quarter of a million pounds from just one builder. All the political parties have expressed outrage at these revelations and pledged to set up ethics committees which will prevent them happening again.

Startling new statistics show that a fifth of girls from 11 to 17 are on a diet. One in seven 11-year-olds and one in three 16-year-olds are trying to lose weight. The findings of one of the most comprehensive surveys ever completed on the country's schoolgirls will confirm parents' and doctors' worst fears: that the 'thin is beautiful' culture is pushing children into diets causing them to miss out nutrients vital for the health of their growing bodies. Worryingly, the girls know they shouldn't be dieting and 80 per cent said they are happy with the way they look. But the most compelling evidence that they are not came from the numbers on diets, with 90 per cent of girls admitting they felt pressure to 'look perfect'. The Guide Association research, called Today's Girl, Tomorrow's Woman, pointed to reasons other than wanting to look good for the opposite sex for dieting. Apart from being thin, success was what most girls wanted. An overwhelming number of today's schoolgirls would choose a good career over a good relationship, and they believe it is up to them to achieve it. A family is the last thing on their minds, with pregnancy coming second only to failing exams as the biggest fear in their lives.

But a glimpse of its seamy underbelly emerged last week as campaigners offered a \u00a350,000 reward to find the killers of a 19-year-old girl sucked into a world of drugs and depravity.</p> <p>The case of Katrina Taylor has focused attention on the increasing problems of Brighton and on its crumbling estates a short distance from the homes of such famous residents as Zo\u00eb Ball, Chris Eubank and Heather Mills, Paul McCartney's new girlfriend. Against a backdrop of a dramatic increase in burglaries, muggings and shootings, private investigators trying to find Taylor's killers last week revealed that they had received death threats as fly-posters were put up around town calling for justice for a woman whose life was ruined by drugs.</p> <p>Katrina Taylor was found stabbed to death in a graveyard in July 1996. Despite a big police inquiry and two Crown Court trials, no one has been found guilty of her murder. Campaigners believe this is because of the local force's failure to investigate the crime properly. They want a full investigation by the Police Complaints Authority.</p> <p>Last week they began distributing a list of Sussex officers who are accused of varying degrees of incompetence, from allegedly failing to investigate the background of key witnesses to failing to respond to information about the whereabouts of the accused. The campaigners have uncovered evidence that they say links the murder to a fraud gang operating out of nearby Peacehaven and claim this has not been properly investigated.</p> <p>The murder attracted great publicity when it was discovered that the victim had taken part in a police murder reconstruction in 1986, posing as nine-year-old Nicola Fellows who had been found strangled in a Brighton park along with a friend. Ten years later, Katrina was struggling to bring up her baby daughter and fund her \u00a3200-per-week heroin habit.</p> <p>Late in the evening of 8 May 1996 she agreed to act as lookout while her boyfriend Mattie Laurie and friend John Cosham burgled a house belonging to Neisha Williams, the former girlfriend of a drug dealer. As well as stealing personal belongings, the thieves set fire to furniture and flooded two rooms. After using her contacts to find out who had been responsible, Williams formed a posse which rampaged through Brighton hellbent on revenge.</p> <p>Among the members of the gang were her ex-boyfriend Trevor Smith, a white Londoner obsessed with black culture who had a string of previous convictions. He called his flatmate, Fergal Scollan, who had previous convictions for assault and actual bodily harm. With Smith he had begun a large-scale operation growing super-strong 'skunk' cannabis. Williams's brother, Simon, was also in the posse.</p> <p>Laurie could not be found - he had already been arrested for the robbery - so the posse tracked down Cosham. He was beaten and stabbed in both legs with a screwdriver. A friend who was found with him was stabbed in the face, beaten with a hammer and repeatedly kicked in the head. The posse then moved on to track down Katrina Taylor. They forced their way into her family home and attacked her sister, but Katrina was nowhere to be found.</p> <p>The following day Katrina was arrested for her part in the burglary. Detectives asked magistrates to remand her in custody, but she was granted bail to look after her eight-month-old daughter. Nearly two months later Simon Williams spotted her outside a hotel. He persuaded her to go with him to 77 Centurion Road, the council house to which Neisha Williams had moved. Williams called Smith and Scollan who rushed back to Brighton from London. The evening began with a shouting match; at one point a knife was held to Katrina's throat and she agreed to pay for the damage caused by the burglary at the rate of \u00a310 per week from her unemployment benefits. At 11.15pm screaming was heard in a graveyard a short walk from Centurion Road. Katrina's body was found the next morning by a man walking his dog. According to the pathologist's report, she had been held from behind and stabbed from the front by either one or two people.</p> <p>Within weeks, a team of 50 detectives and 15 forensic experts had gathered 400 exhibits - including the murder weapon, which Simon Williams had disposed of down a drain in Peacehaven - and 150 statements. Neisha and Simon Williams, along with Smith and Scollan, were arrested and charged with murder.</p> <p>At the trial at Lewes Crown Court in June 1997 Neisha and Simon Williams claimed Katrina had left the flat that evening with Scollan and Smith, who later returned saying she was dead. Scollan and Smith claimed she had left with the Williamses and that the exact opposite was true. Both men said they believed Simon Williams had killed Katrina and they had gone into hiding. Simon Williams admitted trying to dispose of the murder weapon.</p> <p>Neisha was found guilty of false imprisonment but she and her brother were cleared of murder. Smith and Scollan were found guilty. Smith and Scollan launched an immediate appeal claiming the judge had misdirected the jury over aspects of the evidence. The Court of Appeal ordered a retrial which began at the Old Bailey in October 1999.</p> <p>For legal reasons, Neisha and Simon Williams did not give evidence. Lawyers for Smith and Scollan successfully argued that there was no case to answer, and the judge directed that both men be acquitted of murder because of insufficient evidence. Scollan had a charge of false imprisonment dropped. Smith admitted the same charge and was sentenced to 30 months but walked free because of time served.</p> <p>Katrina's mother, Kathy, told The Observer : 'I am disgusted how this has turned out. It has destroyed my faith in the justice system and the police. My daughter was stabbed to death and no one has been made to pay. I won't rest until they are.'</p> <p>Kathy will meet campaigners this week to discuss options for moving forward. A spokesperson for Sussex Police said: 'The police thoroughly investigated this murder. The file remains open, and if anyone has information we would urge them to come forward.'</p>",

Williams's brother, Simon, was also in the posse. Laurie could not be found - he had already been arrested for the robbery - so the posse tracked down Cosham. He was beaten and stabbed in both legs with a screwdriver. A friend who was found with him was stabbed in the face, beaten with a hammer and repeatedly kicked in the head. The posse then moved on to track down Katrina Taylor. They forced their way into her family home and attacked her sister, but Katrina was nowhere to be found. The following day Katrina was arrested for her part in the burglary. Detectives asked magistrates to remand her in custody, but she was granted bail to look after her eight-month-old daughter. Nearly two months later Simon Williams spotted her outside a hotel. He persuaded her to go with him to 77 Centurion Road, the council house to which Neisha Williams had moved. Williams called Smith and Scollan who rushed back to Brighton from London. The evening began with a shouting match; at one point a knife was held to Katrina's throat and she agreed to pay for the damage caused by the burglary at the rate of \u00a310 per week from her unemployment benefits. At 11.15pm screaming was heard in a graveyard a short walk from Centurion Road. Katrina's body was found the next morning by a man walking his dog. According to the pathologist's report, she had been held from behind and stabbed from the front by either one or two people. Within weeks, a team of 50 detectives and 15 forensic experts had gathered 400 exhibits - including the murder weapon, which Simon Williams had disposed of down a drain in Peacehaven - and 150 statements. Neisha and Simon Williams, along with Smith and Scollan, were arrested and charged with murder. At the trial at Lewes Crown Court in June 1997 Neisha and Simon Williams claimed Katrina had left the flat that evening with Scollan and Smith, who later returned saying she was dead. Scollan and Smith claimed she had left with the Williamses and that the exact opposite was true. Both men said they believed Simon Williams had killed Katrina and they had gone into hiding. Simon Williams admitted trying to dispose of the murder weapon. Neisha was found guilty of false imprisonment but she and her brother were cleared of murder. Smith and Scollan were found guilty. Smith and Scollan launched an immediate appeal claiming the judge had misdirected the jury over aspects of the evidence. The Court of Appeal ordered a retrial which began at the Old Bailey in October 1999. For legal reasons, Neisha and Simon Williams did not give evidence. Lawyers for Smith and Scollan successfully argued that there was no case to answer, and the judge directed that both men be acquitted of murder because of insufficient evidence. Scollan had a charge of false imprisonment dropped. Smith admitted the same charge and was sentenced to 30 months but walked free because of time served. Katrina's mother, Kathy, told The Observer : 'I am disgusted how this has turned out. It has destroyed my faith in the justice system and the police. My daughter was stabbed to death and no one has been made to pay. I won't rest until they are.' Kathy will meet campaigners this week to discuss options for moving forward. A spokesperson for Sussex Police said: 'The police thoroughly investigated this murder. The file remains open, and if anyone has information we would urge them to come forward.'",

'We have developed the potential for screening our environments - both internal and external - for traces of chemicals, right down to the level of a couple of parts per million.' Findlay's research at Leeds University has focused on membranes, the gossamer-thin skins that cover all living cells, and protect them against chemical and biological invasions. Membranes form an entire coat around a cell, except at key points where long protein receptors form pathways from the surface down into the cell's interior. These control the exchange of chemicals, nutrients and waste products. First, a chemical latches on to the external end of the receptor, triggering a signal that passes along the receptor, eventually activating the internal end that is sticking into the cell's interior.

These receptors no longer reacted to the yeast pheromone, but to a vast range of different chemical substances ranging from relatively simply chemicals such as carbon monoxide to highly complicated organic molecules, including those given off by living organisms. Then the Leeds team used a genetically engineered yeast strain whose receptor protein - when stimulated by a chemical visitor - released a special molecule that in turn triggered a biological cascade to spread through its interior, causing the cell to turn blue. 'Essentially, we have a line of yeast cells so they no longer react to a single pheromone, but to a vast range of other chemicals,' said Findlay. 'In fact, we still do not know exactly what chemicals the yeast will react to, for we created our library only a few months ago.

All we have to do is put a chemical near a sample, and, if it turns blue, we shall have found a yeast sensor for that chemical.' Only a few molecules of chemical are sufficient to trigger a visible reaction from a yeast cell, say the Leeds researchers, which should allow their biosensors to detect substances at levels of one part per million. Their ideas have now been patented and the team, and their industrial collaborators, Lanehawk, are seeking partners with whom they will exploit their yeast detectors. 'We want to develop a simple way of embedding our cells in a matrix,' added Findlay.

The sight of the slovenly husband loafing around while his long-suffering wife does all the work is, thankfully, becoming more and more rare. 'Single men are also getting more involved in what they once thought of as so-called \"women's work\". The bachelor pad full of mouldy old take-away trays, over-flowing ashtrays and giant pyramids of beer cans is becoming out of date.' And it is not just household chores. The new man about the house is now the one rushing off to Ikea to salivate over sandblasted glass and brushed steel kitchens. Moss Bros, which owns Cecil Gee, Blazer and Savoy Taylors Guild, announced a sharp slump in sales on Friday and warned of job cuts and shop closures. Rowland Gee, the company's managing director, put the drop in business down to men switching their spending from clothes to their homes and electrical goods. A flick through the latest men's magazines shows the 'gentleman's outfitter' is right to be worried. New homeboy is spoilt for choice in the advertisments in GQ, Arena and Stuff magazines. Melanie Howard, co-founder and director of the Future Foundation, says firms are responding to men's complaints that they are being 'pigeon-holed' as lads. 'All our research shows that men don't like commercials where they bring home the bacon and the stay-at-home woman cooks the tea. 'Men want something that reflects their changing lives - something more subtle. New forms of male reality are emerging.' Andy Milligan at Interbrand Newell and Sorrell, who has charted the rise of the new man, says advertisers are 'ahead of the curve'. 'More and more women are abdicating the traditional stay-at-home role, while men think it is cool to be caring and nurturing. 'Look at Dennis Wise taking his son to lift up the FA Cup last weekend, or David Beckham rowing with Alex Ferguson when he takes time off to look after his ill son while Posh is on the catwalk. 'It is not just an image-change. Life is becoming more balanced. It's not all work, work, work for men. They value the time they have with the family and want to demonstrate that. More and more firms understand that and are targeting the new mindset.' john.arlidge@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>It's hard to miss them: The epitome of casual 'geek chic' and organised within the warranty of their Palm Pilots, they sip labour-intensive caf\u00e9 lattes, chat on sleek cellphones and ponder the road to enlightenment. In the US they worry about the environment as they drive their gas-guzzling sports utility vehicles to emporiums of haute design to buy a $50 titanium spatula; they think about their tech stocks as they explore speciality shops for Tibetan artefacts in Everest-worthy hiking boots. They think nothing of laying out $5 for a wheatgrass muff, much less $500 for some alternative rejuvenation at the day-spa - but don't talk about raising their taxes.</p> <p>They are 'bourgeois bohemians' - or 'Bobos' - and they're the new 'enlightened \u00e9lite' of the information age, their lucratively busy lives a seeming synthesis of comfort and conscience, corporate success and creative rebellion. Well-educated thirty-to-fortysomethings, they have forged a new social ethos from a logic-defying fusion of 1960s counter-culture and 1980s entrepreneurial materialism.</p> <p>So proclaims David Brooks, the American journalist and self-avowed 'Bobo', who coined the phrase to describe the new cultural and corporate hegemony of his cosmopolitan, computer-savvy contemporaries, many of whom will no doubt recognise themselves in Bobos In Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There .</p> <p>'These Bobos define our age. They are the new establishment. Their hybrid culture is the atmosphere we all breathe,' Brooks declares in his 'comic sociology' of Bobo manners and mores. 'Their status codes now govern social life.' A phenomenon in step with the hard-driving digital utopianism promised by the internet and its money-spinning 'new economy', not to mention the 'Third Way' politics of President Clinton and Tony Blair, the Bobos have seized upon an ingenious way to sell without selling out - or so they tell themselves.</p> <p>Combining the free-spirited, artistic rebelliousness of the bohemian beatnik or hippie with the worldly ambitions of their bourgeois corporate forefathers, the Bobo is a comfortable contortion of caring capitalism. 'It's not about making money,' writes Brooks, 'it's about doing something you love. Life should be an extended hobby. It's all about working for a company as cool as you are.'</p> <p>It is a world inhabited by dotcom millionaires, management consultants, 'culture industry' entrepreneurs and all manner of media folk, most earning upwards of $100,000 a year - their money, claims Brooks, an incidental byproduct of their maverick mores, 'the kind of money you happen to earn while you are pursuing your creative vision'. Often sporting such unconventional job titles as 'creative paradox', 'corporate jester' or 'learning person', Bobos work with a monk-like self-discipline because they view their jobs as intellectual, even spiritual. 'It is a reverse Midas touch: everything a Bobo touches turns to spirituality, everything has to be about enlightenment. Even their jobs are a mission to improve the world,' says Brooks, himself a political columnist for the conservative Weekly Standard.</p> <p>Clearly the Bobo is not entirely new - think Virgin's Richard Branson, the Body Shop's Anita Roddick and Apple Computer's Steve Jobs. But suddenly Bobos are everywhere, or so it struck Brooks after four years abroad in the 1990s. His wealthy white-bread Pennsylvania hometown was now firmly focaccia, with half a dozen new gourmet coffee shops, independent booksellers and countless purveyors of 'fat smelly candles' and 'hand-painted TV armoires'.</p> <p>'It was now impossible to tell an espresso-sipping artist from a cappuccino-gulping banker,' observed Brooks - but it wasn't just a matter of style. 'I found that if you investigated people's attitudes towards sex, morality, leisure time and work, it was getting harder and harder to separate the anti-establishment renegade from the pro-establishment company man. Most people seemed to have rebel attitudes and social-climbing attitudes all scrambled together.'</p> <p>Sounds familiar, says British trend-spotter Peter York. 'I am a good example of a bourgeois bohemian, well a little more bourgeois than bohemian, but I'm it. I've been thinking about Bobos for months; they are all around me, and they've been a long time coming, in a sense, a no-brainer, an inevitable \"end of history\" phenomenon, with all ideological wars ended, religious schisms over.'</p> <p>York says there are more than a million British Bobos, sharing with their US counterparts the same proclivities for spiritual growth, creative fulfilment, Tuscan-tiled stainless steel kitchens, distressed Third World antiques and hi-tech titanium sporting gear. 'Most likely they live in Notting Hill or some other urban confluence of dressed-down bohemian wealth, and their home decor says, \"I've been there, I smoke a bit of dope\".'</p> <p>Names, I want names, I tell Brooks. 'Well, writing for The Observer counts,' he tells me, 'and the BBC, the BBC is a red-hot centre of Boboism, though [Jeremy] Paxman is too angry to qualify.</p> <p>'As for me, I'm a confirmed Bobo.

      "bodyText": "It's hard to miss them: The epitome of casual 'geek chic' and organised within the warranty of their Palm Pilots, they sip labour-intensive caf\u00e9 lattes, chat on sleek cellphones and ponder the road to enlightenment. In the US they worry about the environment as they drive their gas-guzzling sports utility vehicles to emporiums of haute design to buy a $50 titanium spatula; they think about their tech stocks as they explore speciality shops for Tibetan artefacts in Everest-worthy hiking boots. They think nothing of laying out $5 for a wheatgrass muff, much less $500 for some alternative rejuvenation at the day-spa - but don't talk about raising their taxes. They are 'bourgeois bohemians' - or 'Bobos' - and they're the new 'enlightened \u00e9lite' of the information age, their lucratively busy lives a seeming synthesis of comfort and conscience, corporate success and creative rebellion. Well-educated thirty-to-fortysomethings, they have forged a new social ethos from a logic-defying fusion of 1960s counter-culture and 1980s entrepreneurial materialism. So proclaims David Brooks, the American journalist and self-avowed 'Bobo', who coined the phrase to describe the new cultural and corporate hegemony of his cosmopolitan, computer-savvy contemporaries, many of whom will no doubt recognise themselves in Bobos In Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There . 'These Bobos define our age. They are the new establishment. Their hybrid culture is the atmosphere we all breathe,' Brooks declares in his 'comic sociology' of Bobo manners and mores. 'Their status codes now govern social life.' A phenomenon in step with the hard-driving digital utopianism promised by the internet and its money-spinning 'new economy', not to mention the 'Third Way' politics of President Clinton and Tony Blair, the Bobos have seized upon an ingenious way to sell without selling out - or so they tell themselves. Combining the free-spirited, artistic rebelliousness of the bohemian beatnik or hippie with the worldly ambitions of their bourgeois corporate forefathers, the Bobo is a comfortable contortion of caring capitalism. 'It's not about making money,' writes Brooks, 'it's about doing something you love. Life should be an extended hobby. It's all about working for a company as cool as you are.' It is a world inhabited by dotcom millionaires, management consultants, 'culture industry' entrepreneurs and all manner of media folk, most earning upwards of $100,000 a year - their money, claims Brooks, an incidental byproduct of their maverick mores, 'the kind of money you happen to earn while you are pursuing your creative vision'. Often sporting such unconventional job titles as 'creative paradox', 'corporate jester' or 'learning person', Bobos work with a monk-like self-discipline because they view their jobs as intellectual, even spiritual. 'It is a reverse Midas touch: everything a Bobo touches turns to spirituality, everything has to be about enlightenment. Even their jobs are a mission to improve the world,' says Brooks, himself a political columnist for the conservative Weekly Standard. Clearly the Bobo is not entirely new - think Virgin's Richard Branson, the Body Shop's Anita Roddick and Apple Computer's Steve Jobs. But suddenly Bobos are everywhere, or so it struck Brooks after four years abroad in the 1990s. His wealthy white-bread Pennsylvania hometown was now firmly focaccia, with half a dozen new gourmet coffee shops, independent booksellers and countless purveyors of 'fat smelly candles' and 'hand-painted TV armoires'. 'It was now impossible to tell an espresso-sipping artist from a cappuccino-gulping banker,' observed Brooks - but it wasn't just a matter of style. 'I found that if you investigated people's attitudes towards sex, morality, leisure time and work, it was getting harder and harder to separate the anti-establishment renegade from the pro-establishment company man. Most people seemed to have rebel attitudes and social-climbing attitudes all scrambled together.' Sounds familiar, says British trend-spotter Peter York. 'I am a good example of a bourgeois bohemian, well a little more bourgeois than bohemian, but I'm it. I've been thinking about Bobos for months; they are all around me, and they've been a long time coming, in a sense, a no-brainer, an inevitable \"end of history\" phenomenon, with all ideological wars ended, religious schisms over.' York says there are more than a million British Bobos, sharing with their US counterparts the same proclivities for spiritual growth, creative fulfilment, Tuscan-tiled stainless steel kitchens, distressed Third World antiques and hi-tech titanium sporting gear. 'Most likely they live in Notting Hill or some other urban confluence of dressed-down bohemian wealth, and their home decor says, \"I've been there, I smoke a bit of dope\".' Names, I want names, I tell Brooks. 'Well, writing for The Observer counts,' he tells me, 'and the BBC, the BBC is a red-hot centre of Boboism, though [Jeremy] Paxman is too angry to qualify. 'As for me, I'm a confirmed Bobo. Now half-author, half-salesman, I've been stunned by how much I've taken up the selling fervour.' But not everyone is buying it. 'It's a misnomer, a simple- minded idea and a convenient cover for baby-boomers to feel proud of themselves,' says Debbie Geller, an American who produces BBC arts and culture documentaries. 'These Bobos are just normal middle-class people who can't accept that status because they've always hated it. They are living out a protracted adolescence.' Toby Miller, a professor of popular culture at New York University, suspects Boboism has more to do with style than substance. 'But Brooks is on to something significant: the Bobo is at once a social liberal and an economic conservative; freedom and justice for all, they say, but don't worry about systematic economic inequality.' Their political interests, Miller says, are either 'intensely close and personal' (abortion or gun control), or very remote (the rainforests, Tibet or Third World poverty.) But they will most likely express their conscience in their consumerism, relieved to be helping someone somewhere by collecting the hand-carved artefacts of distant cultures. While bemoaning the Bobo's 'boring politics', Brooks believes the Bobos to be an \u00e9lite superior to their intolerant and warring predecessors - 'they've certainly made shopping more fun, and they have a good morality for building a decent society,' he says. 'This is an \u00e9lite that has been raised to oppose \u00e9lites. They are by instinct anti-establishmentarian, yet somehow sense they have become a new establishment. They are prosperous without seeming greedy; they have pleased their elders, without seeming conformist; they have risen toward the top without too obviously looking down on those below,' he says.

They are offended by concrete wrongs, such as cruelty and racial injustice, but are relatively unmoved by lies or transgressions that don't seem to do anyone any obvious harm.' For now, the old fiery antipathy between bourgeois and bohemian is a distant memory, tensions reconciled, and corporate advertising is finding inspiration in Jack Kerouac, Gandhi and 'Born to be Wild'. We have reached the point, says Brooks, where 'the hedonism of Woodstock mythology has been domesticated and now serves as a management tool for the Fortune 500. 'The intangible world of information merges with the material world of money, and new phrases that combine the two, such as \"intellectual capital\" and \"the culture industry\", come into vogue. So the people who thrive in this period are the ones who can turn ideas and emotions into products.' Indeed, the one realm of American life where the language of 1960s radicalism remains strong is the business world, says Brooks.

      "body": "<p>The Dome is still open, the show inside still goes on. The public still file through its gates in their thousands - not enough to achieve the magic figure of 12 million needed to break even by the end of the year, but respectable by the standards of Britain's tourist traps.</p> <p>But the life has gone out of the project. Less than halfway through what should have been a triumphant first year of the new millennium, the monument to modernity and symbol of all that is great in the new Britain is dying on its feet, caught in a hail of ridicule as its creators and supporters duck for cover.</p> <p>Last week it was left to the deputy Prime Minister to offer a semblance of a defence. For the second time John Prescott was called on to stand in for the Prime Minister at a time of crisis for the Dome, while his boss bonded at home with the tiny Leo. The detailed briefing papers prepared for Prescott's appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time last week simply were not enough to reassure him.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, an anxious Prescott sought out Lord Falconer in person and made clear to the minister in charge his desire to see the Dome spared the ignominy of early closure, despite its financial woes. One source close to Prescott sketched out the scene: 'He talked to Charlie - his view is mainly that he wants to see this thing run until the end of the year. He thinks that, despite what the media say, it has been successful - even if you only get six million people through the gates. He did not want to see it closing early.'</p> <p>That such a fate could even be considered for the Dome - the symbol of Britain's confident advance into the next century - signals how badly things are still going behind the scenes.</p> <p>Although Downing Street insists the plan remains for the Dome to stay open until the end of the year, the gloomy talk at Westminster is of whether one of the two firms bidding to run the site after 2001 could be persuaded to take it off the Government's hands any earlier.</p> <p>Up to 80 MPs have signed a motion protesting against the latest decision to bail it out; the wildly optimistic forecast of 12 million visitors in a year has been almost halved; and the bitter game of shifting the blame around has begun.</p> <p>After the turmoil of the past week, commercial sponsors quietly admit they have given up hope of a return on their \u00a3150 million investment in the Dome. It has simply been written off.</p> <p>But they are far from the only former Dome enthusiasts to back off this week. The architect Richard Rogers has criticised the contents of his dome on Radio 4, the creator of the Millennium Show has spoken to The Observer of recruitment problems and, yesterday, one insider anonymously blamed the fiasco on 'a third-rate team' around the sacked chief executive Jennie Page.</p> <p>The bubble finally burst six days ago in an anonymous meeting room on the 26th floor of the Millennium Commission's minimalist headquarters. The Commissioners had gathered to consider the Dome's second plea for more money in five months.</p> <p>The mood, one source said, was of 'genuine anger' at being held to ransom, and the price extracted this time was the departure of New Millennium Experience Company chair Bob Ayling - the dagger wielded, not by the three politicians in the room, but by independent members including the former children's TV presenter Floella Benjamin.</p> <p>It was all over in an hour and 40 minutes, and the NMEC emerged with another \u00a329 million to stave off the latest crisis. For most lay observers, the only surprise was that a full-scale meltdown had been contained for this long.</p> <p>At the birth of the Dome, the then Chancellor, Ken Clarke, was privately sceptical, happy to wish his old ally Michael Heseltine's scheme well - as long as Treasury money was not involved.</p> <p>His reservations were then shared by shadow chancellor Gordon Brown who argued at a series of tense pre-election meetings in the party's Millbank headquarters that the Dome's budget was unconvincing and its themes too vague.</p> <p>He favoured a series of new super-libraries or museums instead, while shadow culture minister Chris Smith wanted something smaller, less elaborate and more educational.</p> <p>Even Lord Falconer now concedes that the original business plan on which profitability was pinned was 'flawed' and 'over-optimistic'.</p> <p>Conventional wisdom paints Mr Prescott as the fairy godfather who persuaded a wavering Tony Blair to adopt the Dome shortly after the 1997 election, thundering at the Prime Minister: 'If we can't make this work, we're not much of a Government.'</p> <p>Like all myths it contains some truth, but the real story is more complex. Other Cabinet ministers explain that the decision to take on the Tory project was made before the election by Blair and Peter Mandelson, both genuinely excited by the sheer scale of the project and aware of the potential backlash were Labour to dump it, with construction poised to begin.</p> <p>The budget had already been pruned back from over \u00a31 billion to \u00a3758 million, a process ex-chief executive Jennie Page subsequently described as 'hack and destroy'.</p> <p>Throughout 1998 and 1999, the Commission repeatedly queried the NMEC's forecast of 12 million visitors, an estimate on which its financial success would depend.</p> <p>By the end of 1999, the Commission had realised the NMEC risked a cash crisis in its first two months of opening.</p> <p>And by February, following a dismal first few weeks, they were proved right: the NMEC asked for - and got - another \u00a360 million to resolve 'cashflow problems'.</p> <p>Publicly ministers have insisted that the latest handout is different, based on a new and sound business plan of stringent cutbacks.</p> <p>But the uncertainty has sent staff morale plummeting: Mark Fisher, creator of the Millennium Show, admits it has been hard to replace technical staff who have left. Many are being lured away to work on the West End's big musicals instead.</p> <p>And some sponsors say they were kept out in the cold during the latest drama, learning about the extra grant only after the event. Although they owe around \u00a37 million between them in instalments still to be paid under sponsorship agreements, the NMEC did not approach them for a cash advance. Francis Thomas of Boots concedes: 'I think they would have known that we were not going to give it to them.'</p> <p>The mood among many of the sponsors is now one of resignation. 'We are all such large corporations,' said one on Friday, 'that to be honest even an investment this big has been written off by now. There are other future sponsorships schemes which are taking up more of our time now.'</p> <p>If the business plan has been savaged, the creative vision of the Dome has hardly escaped censure either. Sceptical MPs say the Government was too ambitious. 'It was part of the delusions of omnipotence that New Labour had, having won the election - we really believed that Tony Blair could walk on water,' says one veteran Labour backbencher. 'It wanted for a central idea. We had all the rhetoric, but it was vacuous and there was nothing there.'</p> <p>The creative teams have complained of being held back by nervous commercial sponsors. But Boots says it gave considerable freedom to its partner in the Body Zone, John Hackney, while BT's Adrian Horsford says businesses certainly cannot shoulder the blame for creative flaws, adding: 'Clearly the zones belong to the NMEC and it was their responsibility to make them right. When the Talk Zone opened there were some things we were not happy with but we put those right.'</p> <p>The sponsors have at least been cheered by the arrival of the French Disney executive P-Y Gerbeau. One added: 'He at least knew how to mend the doors when they broke and how to keep the lights on.'</p> <p>Gerbeau's approach also impressed John Prescott, who held a half-hour meeting with him when he was first appointed. But the Frenchman faces an uphill task drawing an increasingly apathetic British public across London and through the Dome's doors.</p> <p>Ironically the NMEC can claim that once there, most visitors do enjoy themselves: 84 per cent say they have had a good time. It blames the dwindling queues on damning media reviews, the strong British pound deterring tourists, and even on the fact that the 'Millennium effect' amounted to little more than an extended New Year's Eve for most Britons.</p> <p>Meanwhile ministers tirelessly point out that if the Dome achieves its seven million visitors it will still be the second most popular paying attraction in Europe, beating rivals like Alton Towers.</p> <p>Millennium Commissioner Floella Benjamin, whispered to have been the main player calling for Ayling's head, insisted that 'what I did behind closed doors is private,' but added: 'We should remember to be proud to be British and proud of what we have in</p> <p>'The show is a magical thing and I certainly hope the new money means that we can continue until the end of the year. We have to give it a chance now.'</p> <p>The next crunch point for the Dome will come in July, when ministers will decide between the two bids from Japanese bank Nomura or its rival Legacy - to take over and run the Dome site when the NMEC is wound up at the end of the year.</p> <p>This sale is the Millennium Commission's best hope of recovering its money, and it will examine the Dome's finances again after the July decision is made.</p> <p>Closing the Dome early would be politically unpalatable, and could cost between \u00a3100-\u00a3200 million if employees, suppliers and sponsors had to be compensated for the abrupt termination of their contracts.</p> <p>Allowing the NMEC's successor to take the Dome off their hands early would be only a little less humiliating, and Nomura - regarded as the frontrunner - has flatly denied discussing the option with ministers.</p> <p>But the suggestion has been floated in Westminster circles as one possible way out.

      "bodyText": "The Dome is still open, the show inside still goes on. The public still file through its gates in their thousands - not enough to achieve the magic figure of 12 million needed to break even by the end of the year, but respectable by the standards of Britain's tourist traps. But the life has gone out of the project. Less than halfway through what should have been a triumphant first year of the new millennium, the monument to modernity and symbol of all that is great in the new Britain is dying on its feet, caught in a hail of ridicule as its creators and supporters duck for cover. Last week it was left to the deputy Prime Minister to offer a semblance of a defence. For the second time John Prescott was called on to stand in for the Prime Minister at a time of crisis for the Dome, while his boss bonded at home with the tiny Leo. The detailed briefing papers prepared for Prescott's appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time last week simply were not enough to reassure him. On Wednesday morning, an anxious Prescott sought out Lord Falconer in person and made clear to the minister in charge his desire to see the Dome spared the ignominy of early closure, despite its financial woes. One source close to Prescott sketched out the scene: 'He talked to Charlie - his view is mainly that he wants to see this thing run until the end of the year. He thinks that, despite what the media say, it has been successful - even if you only get six million people through the gates. He did not want to see it closing early.' That such a fate could even be considered for the Dome - the symbol of Britain's confident advance into the next century - signals how badly things are still going behind the scenes. Although Downing Street insists the plan remains for the Dome to stay open until the end of the year, the gloomy talk at Westminster is of whether one of the two firms bidding to run the site after 2001 could be persuaded to take it off the Government's hands any earlier. Up to 80 MPs have signed a motion protesting against the latest decision to bail it out; the wildly optimistic forecast of 12 million visitors in a year has been almost halved; and the bitter game of shifting the blame around has begun. After the turmoil of the past week, commercial sponsors quietly admit they have given up hope of a return on their \u00a3150 million investment in the Dome. It has simply been written off. But they are far from the only former Dome enthusiasts to back off this week. The architect Richard Rogers has criticised the contents of his dome on Radio 4, the creator of the Millennium Show has spoken to The Observer of recruitment problems and, yesterday, one insider anonymously blamed the fiasco on 'a third-rate team' around the sacked chief executive Jennie Page. The bubble finally burst six days ago in an anonymous meeting room on the 26th floor of the Millennium Commission's minimalist headquarters. The Commissioners had gathered to consider the Dome's second plea for more money in five months. The mood, one source said, was of 'genuine anger' at being held to ransom, and the price extracted this time was the departure of New Millennium Experience Company chair Bob Ayling - the dagger wielded, not by the three politicians in the room, but by independent members including the former children's TV presenter Floella Benjamin. It was all over in an hour and 40 minutes, and the NMEC emerged with another \u00a329 million to stave off the latest crisis. For most lay observers, the only surprise was that a full-scale meltdown had been contained for this long. At the birth of the Dome, the then Chancellor, Ken Clarke, was privately sceptical, happy to wish his old ally Michael Heseltine's scheme well - as long as Treasury money was not involved. His reservations were then shared by shadow chancellor Gordon Brown who argued at a series of tense pre-election meetings in the party's Millbank headquarters that the Dome's budget was unconvincing and its themes too vague. He favoured a series of new super-libraries or museums instead, while shadow culture minister Chris Smith wanted something smaller, less elaborate and more educational. Even Lord Falconer now concedes that the original business plan on which profitability was pinned was 'flawed' and 'over-optimistic'. Conventional wisdom paints Mr Prescott as the fairy godfather who persuaded a wavering Tony Blair to adopt the Dome shortly after the 1997 election, thundering at the Prime Minister: 'If we can't make this work, we're not much of a Government.' Like all myths it contains some truth, but the real story is more complex. Other Cabinet ministers explain that the decision to take on the Tory project was made before the election by Blair and Peter Mandelson, both genuinely excited by the sheer scale of the project and aware of the potential backlash were Labour to dump it, with construction poised to begin. The budget had already been pruned back from over \u00a31 billion to \u00a3758 million, a process ex-chief executive Jennie Page subsequently described as 'hack and destroy'. Throughout 1998 and 1999, the Commission repeatedly queried the NMEC's forecast of 12 million visitors, an estimate on which its financial success would depend. By the end of 1999, the Commission had realised the NMEC risked a cash crisis in its first two months of opening. And by February, following a dismal first few weeks, they were proved right: the NMEC asked for - and got - another \u00a360 million to resolve 'cashflow problems'. Publicly ministers have insisted that the latest handout is different, based on a new and sound business plan of stringent cutbacks. But the uncertainty has sent staff morale plummeting: Mark Fisher, creator of the Millennium Show, admits it has been hard to replace technical staff who have left. Many are being lured away to work on the West End's big musicals instead. And some sponsors say they were kept out in the cold during the latest drama, learning about the extra grant only after the event. Although they owe around \u00a37 million between them in instalments still to be paid under sponsorship agreements, the NMEC did not approach them for a cash advance. Francis Thomas of Boots concedes: 'I think they would have known that we were not going to give it to them.' The mood among many of the sponsors is now one of resignation. 'We are all such large corporations,' said one on Friday, 'that to be honest even an investment this big has been written off by now. There are other future sponsorships schemes which are taking up more of our time now.' If the business plan has been savaged, the creative vision of the Dome has hardly escaped censure either. Sceptical MPs say the Government was too ambitious. 'It was part of the delusions of omnipotence that New Labour had, having won the election - we really believed that Tony Blair could walk on water,' says one veteran Labour backbencher. 'It wanted for a central idea. We had all the rhetoric, but it was vacuous and there was nothing there.' The creative teams have complained of being held back by nervous commercial sponsors. But Boots says it gave considerable freedom to its partner in the Body Zone, John Hackney, while BT's Adrian Horsford says businesses certainly cannot shoulder the blame for creative flaws, adding: 'Clearly the zones belong to the NMEC and it was their responsibility to make them right. When the Talk Zone opened there were some things we were not happy with but we put those right.' The sponsors have at least been cheered by the arrival of the French Disney executive P-Y Gerbeau. One added: 'He at least knew how to mend the doors when they broke and how to keep the lights on.' Gerbeau's approach also impressed John Prescott, who held a half-hour meeting with him when he was first appointed. But the Frenchman faces an uphill task drawing an increasingly apathetic British public across London and through the Dome's doors. Ironically the NMEC can claim that once there, most visitors do enjoy themselves: 84 per cent say they have had a good time. It blames the dwindling queues on damning media reviews, the strong British pound deterring tourists, and even on the fact that the 'Millennium effect' amounted to little more than an extended New Year's Eve for most Britons. Meanwhile ministers tirelessly point out that if the Dome achieves its seven million visitors it will still be the second most popular paying attraction in Europe, beating rivals like Alton Towers. Millennium Commissioner Floella Benjamin, whispered to have been the main player calling for Ayling's head, insisted that 'what I did behind closed doors is private,' but added: 'We should remember to be proud to be British and proud of what we have in 'The show is a magical thing and I certainly hope the new money means that we can continue until the end of the year. We have to give it a chance now.' The next crunch point for the Dome will come in July, when ministers will decide between the two bids from Japanese bank Nomura or its rival Legacy - to take over and run the Dome site when the NMEC is wound up at the end of the year. This sale is the Millennium Commission's best hope of recovering its money, and it will examine the Dome's finances again after the July decision is made. Closing the Dome early would be politically unpalatable, and could cost between \u00a3100-\u00a3200 million if employees, suppliers and sponsors had to be compensated for the abrupt termination of their contracts. Allowing the NMEC's successor to take the Dome off their hands early would be only a little less humiliating, and Nomura - regarded as the frontrunner - has flatly denied discussing the option with ministers. But the suggestion has been floated in Westminster circles as one possible way out. One insider said: 'My understanding is that Nomura and Legacy both have indicated that they could come in at a mutually agreed time before or after the end of the year.' Whatever happens in July, Nomura has clearly learnt from its predecessor's mistakes. Insiders say their plan would add the pizzazz the Dome is accused of lacking, keeping many of the exhibits but adding others to make the experience 'much more fun, a very strong high technology element - it is going to be much more buzzy.' Crucially, it is only promising to attract a modest five million visitors. If the Dome had done the same, things might have been very different. The \u00a329 million cash injection might have purchased the Millennium Dome a reasonable cosmetic uplift in time for this Bank Holiday weekend.

Families who had braved the Saturday morning downpour milled around the echoing empty spaces, their faces puzzled and bored. After last week's resignation of former British Airways chief executive Bob Ayling - chairman of the Millennium Experience Company - the Dome bore all the hallmarks of the final scenes of a tragedy. Safe from the rain, a few open-minded visitors wandered from zone to zone. Robert Harris, 46, from Milton Keynes, held on to his three children. 'First time I've been here,' he said. 'Thought I'd come and see just exactly what everyone was complaining about. It is a bit disappointing, really. Not much to do, is there? Even the kids seem a little bored.'

'I've played in several good sides, and I've still got lots of good friends in Liverpool,' he said. 'It's not easy to make direct comparisons, except that I never played in a Champions League match for Liverpool, and obviously I would have liked to.' </p> <p>The feeling on Merseyside is probably now mutual, for while in the later stages of his Liverpool career McManaman was variously characterised as a slacker, a Spice Boy and a spoilt brat who would surely get his comeuppance on the continent, his magnificent contribution to Real's eighth European Cup raises some uncomfortable questions for Anfield in particular and English football in general. The irony of McManaman's current standing as the most successful ever English export to Europe will not be lost on Liverpool supporters who watched their team miss a Champions League place by losing to Leicester and Bradford. The diplomatic McManaman insists he remains on cordial relations with G\u00e9rard Houllier, yet with every elegant surge in Paris he undermined the Frenchman's Anfield revolution, which has basically brought in younger players who are more obviously willing but less enviably gifted. </p> <p>The immediate Anfield futures of Robbie Fowler and Michael Owen cannot be guaranteed while Liverpool remain outside the Champions League echelon, and there is a limit to the number of post-Bosman foreigners supporters will accept in red shirts at a time when real Scousers are bestriding Europe. </p> <p>Those seeking to restrict the influx of foreigners should have a close look at the composition of Real's winning team. No fewer than nine of the 14 players used on the night, including seven of the starting line-up, are Spanish, as is the coach. Of the remaining five, three are top-class South Americans - Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Savio - which leaves just McManaman and Nicolas Anelka as the only non-Spanish EU players 'topping up' the squad. Not exactly inundation, and while the odd Bosnian and Yugoslav can be found on Real's books, cut-price Scandinavians and ageing Serie A stars are conspicuous by their absence. Real are an example of why current proposals to limit the number of work permit players clubs can sign from non-EU countries are completely wrong-headed. </p> <p>The Champions League winners obviously have their voluntary code already. Sign genuine talent from South America, still the most reliable source of exciting young players, and blend it with the best from home. Real do not have a problem with cheap imports, and would be penalised by any reduction in the number of Latin players they could bring over. England, which does have a problem with cheap imports and hardly sources any decent non-EU talent, would be largely unaffected by limitations on work permit players. A cap on non-EU imports is being discussed only because it is workable, whereas restricting movement within the EU is not, but it simply fails to address the problem. </p> <p>In the context of Real's choosiness McManaman's success in Spain is even more impressive, even if it adds a new twist to the old worry about foreigners in the Premiership. Until recently it had been assumed English football was merely damaging its future by an over-reliance on imports, choking off the opportunities for young players and depriving promising performers of necessary early experience. If we are now losing our best players to Europe at the same time as importing their so-so ones, it begins to look as if we are doubly suffering. It is fair to say that McManaman is something of a one-off, and not every English footballer has the confidence to carve out a new career for himself in Europe, but it is not too difficult to imagine Harry Kewell or Mark Bosnich playing in Italy (no loss to England but a blow to Premiership esteem) or Sol Campbell or Rio Ferdinand finally accepting the lure of a club with real Champions League prospects. </p> <p>The charge which may be about to be brought against English football - which has just voted a sixth overseas player in a row as Footballer of the Year - is that is does not value its home-grown players highly enough. Consider, as many a young prospect will now be doing, how dramatically McManaman boosted his international stock by joining a continental side. The last England coach to use him with confidence was Terry Venables, before the emergence of David Beckham. Glenn Hoddle regarded McManaman with suspicion, reviling him for pulling out of the friendly competition in France before the last World Cup and only giving him 17 minutes in the competition proper. Kevin Keegan was willing to give him a try, but appeared to have lost patience after a dismal performance in his last international in Poland. All McManaman's faults were on display that day - the head-down dribbling, the running into blind alleys, the tame surrendering of possession or retention of the ball for too long - and if Keegan decided there and then there were better ways to fill an England shirt your correspondent must admit he was entirely in agreement. </p> <p>McManaman was at Madrid by then but was not regularly making the team and his confidence was low. What changed everything was the arrival of Vicente del Bosque mid-season, who as Manchester United found to their cost, transformed the Champions League campaign by reshuffling the talented players at his disposal and ending up with a Real Madrid who actually played like Real Madrid. Even after his starring role in two quarter-final legs against United, however, McManaman had not heard from Keegan. The week before the final Keegan was enthused enough to talk about bringing him in on the left wing, but one night in Paris apparently convinced the Eng land manager to scrap that tentative plan and rethink his whole formation to accommodate McManaman in midfield. </p> <p>Meteoric rises are not uncommon in football, but rarely can anyone have gone from pariah to prince, from wastrel to wonderboy, in such a short space of time. As McManaman knows. 'I've had my critics and I'll have them again,' he said. 'It's great when people write nice things about you, but you then have to sustain it. Like over this summer with England.' </p> <p>Strictly speaking, this is now Keegan's problem, not McManaman's. The player is not going to carry the can if he flops this summer for England, it will be the manager's fault for not using him properly. Keegan, being Keegan, calls this not so much a problem as a fantastic opportunity. Which it is. If McManaman has forced Keegan to re-examine the way England play he is to be applauded, because something needed to. On the other hand, neither Keegan nor the England defence is really convinced by the wing-back system that McManaman and his Spanish team favour, Phil Neville is no Roberto Carlos, Alan Shearer would not get into the Real side and there are now just two games left for try-outs before Euro 2000 gets under way. </p> <p>There is no ideal solution, and since Paul Scholes is valuable for his goals, Keegan should not be too harshly blamed if he reverts to his original plan of using McManaman broadly on the left. 'It's like a blancmange, you can try different things,' Keegan said in one of his less well-judged soundbites. Pink, wobbly and insubstantial? Surely that was the England (and the McManaman) of six months ago. When the pair are reunited against Ukraine on Wednesday, England expects to see something a little more mature and flavoursome on the menu.</p>",

But this time, the Gunners will pick up only \u00a39.84 million, less than Leeds and Liverpool who finished behind them in the championship. </p> <p>Fewer live appearances on Sky and the BBC's Match of the Day was the reason for the club's drop in TV revenue. In 1998-99, Arsenal were on the box 27 times, including 12 live Sky games; last season they were on only 16 times, with their Sky appearances - each worth \u00a3311,000 - down to seven. </p> <p>A Sky spokeswoman said Arsenal had not been shown so often because their European commitments had made it difficult to schedule their matches. 'We have to give six weeks' notice of which London matches we're showing,' she said, 'and in Arsenal's case this caused problems.'

      "bodyText": "Arsenal may be a little miffed when they discover that their TV money from last season's Premiership is less than the year before, despite the late surge that secured second place in the table and a berth in the 2000-01 European Champions League. In 1998-99, Arsenal topped the money chart after finishing runners-up to Manchester United in the League, the two clubs becoming the first to break through the \u00a310 million barrier for a single season. But this time, the Gunners will pick up only \u00a39.84 million, less than Leeds and Liverpool who finished behind them in the championship. Fewer live appearances on Sky and the BBC's Match of the Day was the reason for the club's drop in TV revenue. In 1998-99, Arsenal were on the box 27 times, including 12 live Sky games; last season they were on only 16 times, with their Sky appearances - each worth \u00a3311,000 - down to seven. A Sky spokeswoman said Arsenal had not been shown so often because their European commitments had made it difficult to schedule their matches. 'We have to give six weeks' notice of which London matches we're showing,' she said, 'and in Arsenal's case this caused problems.' With the Premiership clubs discussing the next television contract, which starts in 2001, Arsenal may press for a for mula that rules out a leading team suffering a drop.

      "body": "<p>Tony Adams's football career had hobbled to a crossroads. His ankle had been giving him gyp for so long, draining the desire for the game that had always characterised him, that he was contemplating retirement. Now here he was in the South of France enduring a make-or-break week of injury rehabilitation. </p> <p>After a punishing day of cycling, running and swimming, he walked wearily one night into a restaurant in Antibes. The figure in the corner looked familiar. It was Marco van Basten, Adams's tormentor at the European Championships of 1988 when a hat-trick from possibly the greatest of all European centre- forwards sent England home in disgrace and fuelled in Holland the confidence to go on and win the tournament. </p> <p>At the end of his meal, Adams went over to ask Van Basten how he was. 'Fine,' he said, though you sensed he wasn't, his brilliant career not long over, his wrecked ankle ligaments the result of the brutality of the early Nineties that belatedly prompted the outlawing of the tackle from behind. 'I wish I was still playing,' he added wistfully. </p> <p>I was there as the ghost writer of Adams's autobiography, Addicted. As we left the restaurant, he turned to me. 'It's time to get back playing,' he said. Adams could not have envisaged it in '88 but 10 years later, Van Basten had given him a reason to be grateful, to savour the time he had left in the game. It was a privilege to witness the moment. Within months, Adams had won the Double with Arsenal and proved himself anew at France 98 as one of the world's outstanding defenders. </p> <p>That had looked an unlikely prospect a decade earlier. The raw 21-year-old was pitched into his first major tournament and 10 days later, as England lost all three group games, found himself making a dash for the car park at Luton Airport to avoid a group of angry fans. It marked the beginning of a rollercoaster relationship with the European Championships over the past 12 years to mirror the nation's as Adams has been variously vilified and left unfulfilled. </p> <p>It is why Euro 2000 represents unfinished business. 'I'm going out there to kick arse,' says England's longest- serving player about the impending tournament in Holland and Belgium. It was a phrase he also used that night in Antibes. </p> <p>Four years after the debacle in Dusseldorf, Adams was fitted for the squad suits but did not make the cut, although Graham Taylor tried unsuccessfully to call him up as a replacement for the injured Mark Wright. Adams's response was to go and get drunk in Greece. Sweden 92 proved a good tournament to miss, though, and he subsequently became England's defensive rock. </p> <p>Then football came home. Adams himself was coming to understand that he was an alcoholic in that heady summer of 1996, and white-knuckled it through without a drink, but semi-final defeat by the Germans on penalties was the trigger for the seven-week bender that was to lead to the rock bottom that turned his life around. Now, four years abstinent from the booze in August - one day at a time, God willing, he will insist on telling you - he also has the chance to turn his and England's European record around. </p> <p>'Our chances are as good as anyone else's,' he says. 'It's pretty level across the field. I don't see any differences between the Dutch, the French, Belgium even, the Italians, the Germans. It's very close. If we get out of the group, we have a hell of a chance. I know that we are just talking the talk and that a lot of things, including luck, do go into it but we do have the potential to win it. Without a shadow of a doubt.' </p> <p>As England possessed in 1988. On paper it was an exciting team - Bryan Robson, Glenn Hoddle, John Barnes, Gary Lineker, Peter Beardsley - but Adams has his own theories why it failed, quite apart from the fact that, in hindsight, the Dutch may have been the best ever European national team and might have seen their way to winning the World Cup two years later but for the fact they scratched each other's eyes out in Italy. 'Remember that in '88 our clubs weren't in Europe,' Adams says. 'It was unusual to play against Dutch and Soviet Union players. Their style of play was completely foreign to us - literally. We used to chase them around the pitch and they just sat back and counter-attacked us. We didn't understand this stuff. Then we would get the ball, kick it long and give it back to them. </p> <p>'And their movement was so good,' he adds, recalling that the direct-style game was getting results for some teams in England at the time, which would lead to Graham Taylor's appointment, the consequence being that English teams too often played in straight lines. Too often, for example, John Barnes ploughed a left-wing furrow when more flexible rotation was required to exploit the talent. 'We got a little bit wiser in '96 with more experience in Europe.' </p> <p>He believes that others were equally responsible for the shortcomings of '88 but that older, wiser England players knew how to keep their heads down when the flak was flying. Adams was close to Van Basten in open play, he agrees but at set pieces, others were detailed to mark him and let him go. Now he sees the value of the lessons. </p> <p>'The international game has changed a lot. Things are much tighter defensively now, better organised. You can expect to have to win a penalty shoot-out somewhere along the line if you are going to win the tournament. The Dutch were the last team to win a major tournament without the need for one. </p> <p>'And the English game has changed dramatically. We are more used to continental styles and players now. Look at the FA Cup final. It's a foreign league now. Playing against that week in, week out has done nothing but good. Younger guys like Michael Owen and Emile Heskey play against Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf. And now, some of the younger players look at the overseas players in training and say, 'What is the fuss all about?\".' </p> <p>He is raring to go. Since being left out of the England Schoolboys side at 13, Adams has always responded to a setback with renewed determination. Arsenal's defeat in the Uefa Cup final by Galatasaray has stoked the embers of the season. 'This time I am on the back of a slap on the wrist,' he says. 'It has fired me into the tournament. I can't wait to go out and take it out on someone. My reaction to losing has always been to go and win something. In '88, I came home and won the title with Arsenal. I thought, \"I'll show you then,\" and I have the same attitude now. The season's not over yet.' </p> <p>France 98 marked Adams's first major tournament without care and worry in his personal life and he savoured it. But there was a hitch. 'Before France, I did have a flat period after we had won the Double and it took me some time to get rid of a feeling of \"here we go again\". I probably floated for a bit, even if, when it started, I was there for every kick and every moment, proud and present in mind and body for the whole thing. </p> <p>'Then, I might have been tempted to miss warm-up games. This time I have trained from the first day. It has been straight down to work. And my body feels all right. I haven't had any trouble with my groin.' A recent operation to remove wisdom teeth has helped in the process of realigning his jaw, his posture and his troublesome back, though a slight back strain and the aftermath of a heavy cold kept him out of yesterday's game against Brazil. 'Euro 2000 is just moving on again. I keep moving on and up. It's part of my process. I am going to throw everything at it and then let go. I'll see how it develops.' </p> <p>This time, he senses more public realism than in '88 or '96, probably due to the November defeat by Scotland. 'The fans are waiting for us to fire them,' he says. 'If we don't get out of the group, they will say that it's just the same as the cricket - \"Why are England so rubbish?\" But I can see them coming round.' </p> <p>Adams does not see the absence of a specialist left-sided player as a serious deficiency. 'We can compensate. I don't see it as a problem. It can be a positive strength in fact. It depends how you play.' He points out that Steve McManaman enjoyed a good tournament in '96 cutting infield from wide. 'Good players can play anywhere,' says Adams. </p> <p>The Germany game will most capture the public imagination, but as a player Adams sees it differently. 'Portugal is the biggest game,' he says. 'That first match is so important to set you up. If you beat Portugal, you are maybe looking at getting a point against Germany. But yes, realistically we did play them off the pitch for 75 minutes in '96 and they have not done well since then so they've got good reason to be apprehensive.' </p> <p>One more score to be settled. Adams will be 34 in October and it will be his last European Championship, though he believes he has one more World Cup in him and is looking forward to being captain again when Alan Shearer retires from the international game after Euro 2000. </p> <p>And one more footballing step at a time. 'I've pretty much done everything domestically,' he says. 'Internationally it's not happened for numerous reasons. I've not been successful and I would like to be.' In the homeland of Marco Van Basten, it would mean final professional rehabilitation indeed to match the personal. </p>",

You can expect to have to win a penalty shoot-out somewhere along the line if you are going to win the tournament. The Dutch were the last team to win a major tournament without the need for one. 'And the English game has changed dramatically. We are more used to continental styles and players now. Look at the FA Cup final. It's a foreign league now. Playing against that week in, week out has done nothing but good. Younger guys like Michael Owen and Emile Heskey play against Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf. And now, some of the younger players look at the overseas players in training and say, 'What is the fuss all about?\".' He is raring to go. Since being left out of the England Schoolboys side at 13, Adams has always responded to a setback with renewed determination. Arsenal's defeat in the Uefa Cup final by Galatasaray has stoked the embers of the season. 'This time I am on the back of a slap on the wrist,' he says. 'It has fired me into the tournament. I can't wait to go out and take it out on someone. My reaction to losing has always been to go and win something. In '88, I came home and won the title with Arsenal. I thought, \"I'll show you then,\" and I have the same attitude now. The season's not over yet.' France 98 marked Adams's first major tournament without care and worry in his personal life and he savoured it. But there was a hitch. 'Before France, I did have a flat period after we had won the Double and it took me some time to get rid of a feeling of \"here we go again\". I probably floated for a bit, even if, when it started, I was there for every kick and every moment, proud and present in mind and body for the whole thing. 'Then, I might have been tempted to miss warm-up games. This time I have trained from the first day. It has been straight down to work. And my body feels all right. I haven't had any trouble with my groin.' A recent operation to remove wisdom teeth has helped in the process of realigning his jaw, his posture and his troublesome back, though a slight back strain and the aftermath of a heavy cold kept him out of yesterday's game against Brazil. 'Euro 2000 is just moving on again. I keep moving on and up. It's part of my process. I am going to throw everything at it and then let go. I'll see how it develops.' This time, he senses more public realism than in '88 or '96, probably due to the November defeat by Scotland. 'The fans are waiting for us to fire them,' he says. 'If we don't get out of the group, they will say that it's just the same as the cricket - \"Why are England so rubbish?\" But I can see them coming round.' Adams does not see the absence of a specialist left-sided player as a serious deficiency. 'We can compensate. I don't see it as a problem. It can be a positive strength in fact. It depends how you play.' He points out that Steve McManaman enjoyed a good tournament in '96 cutting infield from wide. 'Good players can play anywhere,' says Adams. The Germany game will most capture the public imagination, but as a player Adams sees it differently. 'Portugal is the biggest game,' he says. 'That first match is so important to set you up. If you beat Portugal, you are maybe looking at getting a point against Germany. But yes, realistically we did play them off the pitch for 75 minutes in '96 and they have not done well since then so they've got good reason to be apprehensive.' One more score to be settled. Adams will be 34 in October and it will be his last European Championship, though he believes he has one more World Cup in him and is looking forward to being captain again when Alan Shearer retires from the international game after Euro 2000. And one more footballing step at a time. 'I've pretty much done everything domestically,' he says. 'Internationally it's not happened for numerous reasons. I've not been successful and I would like to be.' In the homeland of Marco Van Basten, it would mean final professional rehabilitation indeed to match the personal.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The current cash windfall from the auction of the mobile telephone spectrum should involve decisions on optimal public sector asset management. Public sector expenditures are not currently constrained by the availability of cash - and the Chancellor's prudential requirements on debt and deficit ratios are, for the time being at least, more than satisfied. </p> <p>What determines the chosen path of public expenditures is, in my view, a decision on the optimal shares of consumption and investment, public and private, over the medium term. Whatever path of public expenditures was optimal before the cash windfall from the auction will remain optimal after it, subject only to a few tiny and pedantic qualifications. </p> <p>If so, the use of the cash windfall has to be seen in the context of how to manage a new portfolio of financial assets to the benefit of UK taxpayers, or of any other focus group - the young, for example, or pensioners. </p> <p>The two great lessons of finance are that diversification of asset holdings improves risk-adjusted returns, and that risk has to be assessed over the portfolio as a whole, not on individual investments. </p> <p>Assume that UK taxpayers could hire a fund manager to invest the auction windfall to maximise their risk-adjusted returns. What should they think if she reported back that she was going to invest almost all of it in overpriced British government debt - overpriced because of a shortage of supply exacerbated by an enforced demand from the Minimum Funding Requirement (MFR) of pension funds? </p> <p>They would, and should, sack that manager, perhaps claiming dereliction of duty. Yet that is exactly the course the Chancellor has, so we are told, set; while simultaneously ordering an enquiry into private sector fund management. </p> <p>Diversifying part of the windfall into foreign assets would be prudent asset management. In particular, when countries grow relatively more strongly/ weakly, their currencies tend to appreciate/depreciate. Strong/weak growth leads to large/small tax revenues. In other words, whichever of these two paths growth follows, the value of foreign assets would vary inversely with the pressure on domestic taxpayers, making such assets a beneficial hedge. </p> <p>In any case, expert evidence, for example at a recent Bundesbank workshop, identified the pound as considerably overvalued against all the main foreign currencies - grossly so against the euro. While we cannot forecast short-term movements in nominal exchange rates, history suggests that real exchange rates do return to equilibrium after five to 10 years. </p> <p>While this could occur through continental European inflation rising faster than the UK's, a more likely medium-term scenario is for the nominal pound/euro exchange rate to reverse recent trends. So a sensible fund manager asked to maximise returns, subject to risk, over a five to 10-year horizon would, in my view, now go overweight on foreign assets, including equities as well as bonds. </p> <p>One response would be that, if foreign investment is likely to be so profitable in the medium/longer term, the market will already have done it for you. The reason I do not buy this is that there is a dearth of speculators prepared to hold investments for the long term on the basis of a view of the fundamentals. If market momentum is against a position for six months or a year, most speculators will cut their losses, thereby aggravating the misalignments we observe. </p> <p>Optimal portfolio management to achieve the best risk-adjusted medium-term return for UK Inc. of the auction windfall would include a large (perhaps 50 per cent) purchase of foreign assets and far fewer gilt buy-backs than proposed. But issuing more gilts and instead purchasing foreign assets is identically equivalent to sterilised intervention. Shock! Horror! </p> <p>My erstwhile colleague Willem Buiter, and Anne Sibert (economics professor at London's Birkbeck College) have argued (The Observer, 23 April) that such sterilised intervention rarely moves the exchange rate in practice, and would therefore be only an empty gesture. </p> <p>History does indeed suggest that sterilised intervention only rarely has an identifiably successful effect on the exchange rate, but the portfolio management inherent in the exercise is still worth doing for its own sake. If the exchange rate should also decline in the short term, that would be icing on the cake. It would hardly drive the exchange rate in the wrong direction. </p> <p>Some Eurosceptics may see such intervention as a means of easing the pound into the euro, but it can also be argued that the misalignment provides the best argument for joining a larger, and hence more stable, regional currency. </p> <p>However, if the pound did not fall, the same critics would attack the short-term losses that might result.

      "bodyText": "The current cash windfall from the auction of the mobile telephone spectrum should involve decisions on optimal public sector asset management. Public sector expenditures are not currently constrained by the availability of cash - and the Chancellor's prudential requirements on debt and deficit ratios are, for the time being at least, more than satisfied. What determines the chosen path of public expenditures is, in my view, a decision on the optimal shares of consumption and investment, public and private, over the medium term. Whatever path of public expenditures was optimal before the cash windfall from the auction will remain optimal after it, subject only to a few tiny and pedantic qualifications. If so, the use of the cash windfall has to be seen in the context of how to manage a new portfolio of financial assets to the benefit of UK taxpayers, or of any other focus group - the young, for example, or pensioners. The two great lessons of finance are that diversification of asset holdings improves risk-adjusted returns, and that risk has to be assessed over the portfolio as a whole, not on individual investments. Assume that UK taxpayers could hire a fund manager to invest the auction windfall to maximise their risk-adjusted returns. What should they think if she reported back that she was going to invest almost all of it in overpriced British government debt - overpriced because of a shortage of supply exacerbated by an enforced demand from the Minimum Funding Requirement (MFR) of pension funds? They would, and should, sack that manager, perhaps claiming dereliction of duty. Yet that is exactly the course the Chancellor has, so we are told, set; while simultaneously ordering an enquiry into private sector fund management. Diversifying part of the windfall into foreign assets would be prudent asset management. In particular, when countries grow relatively more strongly/ weakly, their currencies tend to appreciate/depreciate. Strong/weak growth leads to large/small tax revenues. In other words, whichever of these two paths growth follows, the value of foreign assets would vary inversely with the pressure on domestic taxpayers, making such assets a beneficial hedge. In any case, expert evidence, for example at a recent Bundesbank workshop, identified the pound as considerably overvalued against all the main foreign currencies - grossly so against the euro. While we cannot forecast short-term movements in nominal exchange rates, history suggests that real exchange rates do return to equilibrium after five to 10 years. While this could occur through continental European inflation rising faster than the UK's, a more likely medium-term scenario is for the nominal pound/euro exchange rate to reverse recent trends. So a sensible fund manager asked to maximise returns, subject to risk, over a five to 10-year horizon would, in my view, now go overweight on foreign assets, including equities as well as bonds. One response would be that, if foreign investment is likely to be so profitable in the medium/longer term, the market will already have done it for you. The reason I do not buy this is that there is a dearth of speculators prepared to hold investments for the long term on the basis of a view of the fundamentals. If market momentum is against a position for six months or a year, most speculators will cut their losses, thereby aggravating the misalignments we observe. Optimal portfolio management to achieve the best risk-adjusted medium-term return for UK Inc. of the auction windfall would include a large (perhaps 50 per cent) purchase of foreign assets and far fewer gilt buy-backs than proposed. But issuing more gilts and instead purchasing foreign assets is identically equivalent to sterilised intervention. Shock! Horror! My erstwhile colleague Willem Buiter, and Anne Sibert (economics professor at London's Birkbeck College) have argued (The Observer, 23 April) that such sterilised intervention rarely moves the exchange rate in practice, and would therefore be only an empty gesture. History does indeed suggest that sterilised intervention only rarely has an identifiably successful effect on the exchange rate, but the portfolio management inherent in the exercise is still worth doing for its own sake. If the exchange rate should also decline in the short term, that would be icing on the cake. It would hardly drive the exchange rate in the wrong direction. Some Eurosceptics may see such intervention as a means of easing the pound into the euro, but it can also be argued that the misalignment provides the best argument for joining a larger, and hence more stable, regional currency. However, if the pound did not fall, the same critics would attack the short-term losses that might result. Indeed, but, properly assessed, the medium-term overall portfolio risks of concentrating on gilt repurchases are far greater. Again, opponents of intervention such as Buiter and Sibert assert either that it will have too little effect on asset prices - exchange rates, for example - or too much - on, say, long gilt yields. To quote them: 'Long sterling issues on the scale envisaged would soon raise long-term sterling rates, and further operations would no longer be profitable.' As a prospective pensioner, I am all in favour of getting rid of the downwards distortion in long gilt yields. Let us get there first, and find out how much new issuance it involved as part of the exercise. \u0095 Professor Charles Goodhart recently retired as a member of the Monetary Policy Committee.",

The Nasdaq Index has fallen by 40 per cent since the publication of Irrational Exuberance, a book exploring the economics and psychology of financial market behaviour. </p> <p>Its author, economist Professor Robert Shiller of Yale University, has 'found himself elevated to the status of a Wall Street guru', says the New York Times. </p> <p>The book examines the influence of herd mentality, economic triumphalism, sports-style media coverage of stock markets and 'new era' thinking as explanations for a persistent overvaluation of the stock market. It also presents a sobering account of other instances of stock market exuberance from last century and questions the relevance of 'rational expectations'. </p> <p>A week after the book was published, the markets began their precipitous drop, but Shiller stands by the statistician's maxim that correlation is no indication of causality. </p> <p>'I predicted it, but I don't take any responsibility for it,' he says. </p> <p>At his now regular media appearances, Shiller is characterised as a party pooper and a prophet of doom. He is pitted in debate against the authors of a book called Dow 36,000, which contends that the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average will triple when investors realise the true risk characteristics of shares. A colleague of Shiller from Yale University predicts the Dow will rise by nine times to 100,000 in 20 years. </p> <p>'Clocks in San Francisco show the temperature, the time, the Dow and the Nasdaq,' says Shiller. 'You can't go down the street without looking at them.' </p> <p>The stock market and its perceived 'success' over the past decade are ingrained in the American psyche - a symbol of economic virility in exact agreement with ever more tangible advances in technology and communications and financial triumphalism after Cold War victory. </p> <p>He points to advertisements taken out by US merchant bank Merrill Lynch in March 1999, celebrating the 'human achievement' of the Dow reaching 10,000. 'If this is an achievement worth congratulating, then we should congratulate employees whenever they submit glowing self-evaluation reports.' </p> <p>Exuberant valuation of shares means that 'as a society we may invest too much in business start-ups and expansions and too little in infrastructure, education and other human capital'. </p> <p>The basis of Shiller's analysis comes from the emerging field of behavioural finance. It draws on the diverse academic traditions of psychology, sociology and demography as well as financial and mathematical economics. The theory is not new; there are throwbacks to Keynes's 'beauty contest' and George Soros's 'reflexive pricing'. </p> <p>Essentially, he says, the boom is given its own momentum by a series of feedback mechanisms, some psychological, some cultural and some financial - all underpinned by strong market confidence. At first this may reflect a genuine improvement in underlying productivity and profits, but gradually market valuations are detached from fundamentals. </p> <p>The title of the book is taken from Alan Greenspan's most famous question. The chairman of the Federal Reserve asked in 1996: 'How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values?' </p> <p>'Irrational exuberance just about captures the mindset we have right now,' says Shiller. </p> <p>Other popular phrases, such as 'speculative orgy', were too strong, he feels, and would possibly attract a different readership. Besides, Greenspan made that remark two days after playing host to Shiller at a Federal Reserve workshop on the stock market. </p> <p>Shiller's own work centres on financial market volatility and surveys of bankers and large investors since the mid-Eighties. </p> <p>He asks investors how they would predict the Dow to react the day after a 3 per cent fall. In 1989, 35 per cent of the respondents chose an increase, 34 per cent a further drop, 13 per cent said it would stay the same and 18 per cent had no opinion. By last year, 56 per cent chose a rise, 19 per cent a decrease, 12 per cent said it would stay the same, and 13 per cent were don't knows. The ratio of 'increase' to 'decrease' rose from about evens in 1989 to about 3 to 1 in 1999. </p> <p>This informs his general scepticism about the current boom. </p> <p>Shiller's interest in the application of psychology to market behaviour was sparked by his wife, Virginia, a clinical psychologist. Irrational Exuberance is peppered with references to experiments that illustrate the human tendency for overconfidence, the need for psychological anchors and herd behaviour. </p> <p>But at its base doesn't economics make assumptions about the nature of human psychology that are laughably simple? Aren't people rational egotists, economic agents who seek to maximise happiness subject to a budget constraint? </p> <p>'I tend to think the rational model is a tool that has proved to be interesting if you want to think about how economies operate ideally,' he says. 'They are use ful but pretty crude approximations because they ignore psychology, and there are times when they don't work at all - like right now.' </p> <p>Shiller has stronger reservations about the rational expectations revolution. 'It gets tedious when people keep referring to markets as if they magically pooled all information and did everything right. The idea that the unpredictability of returns means that markets are efficient is one of the most remarkable errors in the history of economic thought.' </p> <p>But if he is aware of the empirical limitations of his academic work and the occasional irrationality of market behaviour, he calls himself a strong free marketeer. 'I'm one of the most extreme zealots for expanding markets.' </p> <p>Although he says the insights on irrational market behaviour are applicable to international currency and capital markets, he does not see his work as a justification for more protectionism or a 'Tobin' tax on capital flows. </p> <p>'It seems ironic doesn't it, but what is the alternative to markets?'. </p> <p>Shiller, a charismatic midwesterner, is enjoying that rarest of luxuries for a professional economist, a wide audience - and he seems to enjoy the attention. </p> <p>In many ways he's gnawing away at a key part of the American Dream - that any individual can make it by tapping into a wave of national self confidence. </p> <p>'A lot of the established media are not so comfortable with books that are negative.

      "body": "<p>There are barbarians at the gate again. Barely a decade after the last great corporate carve-up, some of the most famous names in world food are set to be swallowed up once more. </p> <p>First Peak Freans' maker Nabisco and French yoghurt giant Danone snacked on our own United Biscuits, with a $2 billion joint bid in February. So McVities, KP Nuts and Hula Hoops joined names like Rowntrees, Terry's and Walkers Crisps in the hands of the global food giants. </p> <p>And now the goliaths are feasting on themselves. This month, Unilever - producer of everything from Persil to Lipton teas - unveiled a $18bn hostile bid for Bestfoods of the US just days after snapping up Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream and Slimfast diet foods for $2.6bn in loose change. Bestfoods may hardly be a household name over here, but its brands certainly are. With products such as Bovril, Marmite, Hellmann's Mayonnaise and Knorr soups, the US giant is firmly in the premier league of world food. </p> <p>Most tantalising of all, however, is the feeding frenzy now engulfing its New Jersey shelf-mate, Nabisco. Twelve years after starring in the biggest buyout ever at the height of Eighties Wall Street greed, the former Shredded Wheat maker finds itself on the menu again. Britain's Cadbury Schweppes is the latest to confirm it was among no fewer than 13 guests invited to the feast in the $20bn auction being conducted by Nabisco's investment banks, Morgan Stanley and Warburg Dillon Read. </p> <p>The sheer scale of the activity is reminiscent of 1988, the height of the last boom, when within weeks Pillsbury fell to the UK's Grand Metropolitan (now part of Diageo) for $5bn, Kraft Foods to Marlboro-maker Philip Morris for $11bn and finally Nabisco itself to a $20bn junk bond-stuffed deal spearheaded by the barbarians of book and film infamy, US buyout leaders Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, or KKR. </p> <p>The Wall Street shufflers were instrumental in buying food firms and flogging them off. But against the consumer giants, they are strictly Act I players. 'The last wave of consolidation really happened when the likes of Philip Morris came on the scene,' one senior food executive said. 'Now they've digested those deals, the next wave is under way as the leaders seek to cut costs by swallowing firms that fit well. The new factor, though, is retail mergers. More and more food producers are dealing with retailers with a growing global reach. To keep up, we need to offer better prices and a bigger product range.' </p> <p>In the new millennium, the industry dynamics may have been changed by growing supermarket power. But at Nabisco, the key player comes straight from barbarian casting. Carl Icahn, the 64-year-old corporate raider who forced Trans World Airlines to its knees, sparked the frenzy with a $5bn offer for a strategic stake in March. But instead of repelling all boarders, the firm opted to put itself and its brands - Ritz crackers, Planters nuts and Lifesavers and Beech-Nut chewing gums among them - up for sale yet again to the highest bidder. </p> <p>Nabisco's turbulent recent history is a far cry from its homespun roots as a New England cookie maker in 1898. Then, founder Adolphus Green purveyed soda crackers, ginger snaps, wafers and Lorna Doone shortbread to the peckish American public. </p> <p>By the Eighties, the firm was headed by Ross Johnson, a Canadian adventurer who rescued Nabisco from the price-cutting of the 'cookie wars' waged between American bakers and in 1985 led it into a merger with RJ Reynolds, America's second- biggest cigarette maker. Slated though the deal was, it was hardly the first time food and fags had fancied each other. Marlboro man was already on the prowl. And in the UK, too, United Biscuits took a tilt at Imperial Tobacco only to lose out to Lord Hanson. </p> <p>In 1988 KKR's strike on Nabisco astonished even Wall Street. At $20bn, it was nearly twice the size of the biggest takeover to date: the $12bn oil bid by Chevron for Gulf. And with the failure of Jimmy Goldsmith's bid for British American Tobacco a year later, it is also still the biggest completed leveraged buyout in history. </p> <p>And so it might remain, as for KKR it was hardly a success. The bidders paid top dollar and struggled to pay off the debt, especially after Philip Morris plunged the US into a cigarette price war on 'Marlboro Friday' in 1993. Two years later, the Wall Street raiders threw in the towel, selling off their last shares to help prop up Borden, another struggling US food company bought in 1994. </p> <p>By then, many of Nabisco's top brands had been sold at the bankers' behest. Del Monte fruit went to Polly Peck for nearly $1bn. Shredded Wheat went to Post, part of Philip Morris' Kraft Foods, in 1993.

      "bodyText": "There are barbarians at the gate again. Barely a decade after the last great corporate carve-up, some of the most famous names in world food are set to be swallowed up once more. First Peak Freans' maker Nabisco and French yoghurt giant Danone snacked on our own United Biscuits, with a $2 billion joint bid in February. So McVities, KP Nuts and Hula Hoops joined names like Rowntrees, Terry's and Walkers Crisps in the hands of the global food giants. And now the goliaths are feasting on themselves. This month, Unilever - producer of everything from Persil to Lipton teas - unveiled a $18bn hostile bid for Bestfoods of the US just days after snapping up Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream and Slimfast diet foods for $2.6bn in loose change. Bestfoods may hardly be a household name over here, but its brands certainly are. With products such as Bovril, Marmite, Hellmann's Mayonnaise and Knorr soups, the US giant is firmly in the premier league of world food. Most tantalising of all, however, is the feeding frenzy now engulfing its New Jersey shelf-mate, Nabisco. Twelve years after starring in the biggest buyout ever at the height of Eighties Wall Street greed, the former Shredded Wheat maker finds itself on the menu again. Britain's Cadbury Schweppes is the latest to confirm it was among no fewer than 13 guests invited to the feast in the $20bn auction being conducted by Nabisco's investment banks, Morgan Stanley and Warburg Dillon Read. The sheer scale of the activity is reminiscent of 1988, the height of the last boom, when within weeks Pillsbury fell to the UK's Grand Metropolitan (now part of Diageo) for $5bn, Kraft Foods to Marlboro-maker Philip Morris for $11bn and finally Nabisco itself to a $20bn junk bond-stuffed deal spearheaded by the barbarians of book and film infamy, US buyout leaders Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, or KKR. The Wall Street shufflers were instrumental in buying food firms and flogging them off. But against the consumer giants, they are strictly Act I players. 'The last wave of consolidation really happened when the likes of Philip Morris came on the scene,' one senior food executive said. 'Now they've digested those deals, the next wave is under way as the leaders seek to cut costs by swallowing firms that fit well. The new factor, though, is retail mergers. More and more food producers are dealing with retailers with a growing global reach. To keep up, we need to offer better prices and a bigger product range.' In the new millennium, the industry dynamics may have been changed by growing supermarket power. But at Nabisco, the key player comes straight from barbarian casting. Carl Icahn, the 64-year-old corporate raider who forced Trans World Airlines to its knees, sparked the frenzy with a $5bn offer for a strategic stake in March. But instead of repelling all boarders, the firm opted to put itself and its brands - Ritz crackers, Planters nuts and Lifesavers and Beech-Nut chewing gums among them - up for sale yet again to the highest bidder. Nabisco's turbulent recent history is a far cry from its homespun roots as a New England cookie maker in 1898. Then, founder Adolphus Green purveyed soda crackers, ginger snaps, wafers and Lorna Doone shortbread to the peckish American public. By the Eighties, the firm was headed by Ross Johnson, a Canadian adventurer who rescued Nabisco from the price-cutting of the 'cookie wars' waged between American bakers and in 1985 led it into a merger with RJ Reynolds, America's second- biggest cigarette maker. Slated though the deal was, it was hardly the first time food and fags had fancied each other. Marlboro man was already on the prowl. And in the UK, too, United Biscuits took a tilt at Imperial Tobacco only to lose out to Lord Hanson. In 1988 KKR's strike on Nabisco astonished even Wall Street. At $20bn, it was nearly twice the size of the biggest takeover to date: the $12bn oil bid by Chevron for Gulf. And with the failure of Jimmy Goldsmith's bid for British American Tobacco a year later, it is also still the biggest completed leveraged buyout in history. And so it might remain, as for KKR it was hardly a success. The bidders paid top dollar and struggled to pay off the debt, especially after Philip Morris plunged the US into a cigarette price war on 'Marlboro Friday' in 1993. Two years later, the Wall Street raiders threw in the towel, selling off their last shares to help prop up Borden, another struggling US food company bought in 1994. By then, many of Nabisco's top brands had been sold at the bankers' behest. Del Monte fruit went to Polly Peck for nearly $1bn. Shredded Wheat went to Post, part of Philip Morris' Kraft Foods, in 1993. Jacob's Crackers and Smiths Crisps were among European brands which went for $2.5bn to Danone. Now the world's sixth-biggest food producer, the French group was then a middle-ranking biscuit-maker known as BSN; it had bought HP Sauce and Lea &amp; Perrins from Hanson in the late Eighties. 'The leading contenders for Nabisco - Philip Morris and Danone - are those who profited most from Nabisco's break-up,' a City food analyst said. No sooner had KKR retreated, than Icahn rolled his tanks on to Nabisco's lawn. For four years, the sharp-eyed dealmaker laid siege to the firm, making upwards of $250m from his stake-building. After the group sold off Reynolds' international cigarette operations for $1.9bn to Japan Tobacco and demerged the US Winston and Salem brands last year, Icahn cashed in his chips - only to re-emerge this spring. The tantalising attraction of Nabisco is the near half- price discount at which it trades on Wall Street for fear of the huge compensation bill it may yet face if tobacco industry prosecutors come gunning for its assets. Icahn is hardly fazed: 'I like to buy things when nobody likes them,' he is prone to say. The tobacco worries make Marlboro man the analysts' favourite to pick up the whole of Nabisco, as Philip Morris clearly understands the risks. Danone and Cadbury's, meanwhile, who have teamed up, are more interested in cherry-picking the snacks and sweet brands. The auction is likely to continue for weeks yet, if not months.

The two companies are complete, according to Iceland chief executive Malcolm Walker, complementary and combined will create a unique business. The City agreed, but not in quite the way Walker intended. The only reason it will be unique is because no-one else would dream of putting two such businesses together. The concern is understandable. Iceland has only just started to win over the doubters through a combination of strong growth - sales have risen by 30 per cent in the past three years - savvy marketing over high-profile issues such as genetically modified foods, and some nimble footwork on e-commerce.

These can be identified and become 'targets' for drug treatments. </p> <p>This could have a radical impact on the time and cost of bringing new drugs to market. In 1998 the period between pre-clinical trials and launch was estimated as nine years - by 2008 it could be six years. This would have huge implications for the research and development operations of drugs giants such as Glaxo Wellcome, which spends \u00a31.3 billion a year on R&amp;D. </p> <p>Drugs trials go through four stages. They are initially tested on animals; then a three-phase 'clinical' process begins. In Phase I they are tested for safety on healthy people. In Phase II they are tested for safety and efficacy on a wider group of patients. In Phase III they are tested for safety and efficacy on a group of thousands of patients. </p> <p>As Professor Richard Weinshilboum of the US Mayo Clinic, who has done pioneering genetic work into childhood leukaemia, says: 'There is a simple paradigm in all drug development. At one end of the spectrum you want to minimise toxicity. At the other end you want to maximise efficacy.' Thalidomide, for example, failed because while it may have been effective, it was toxic. </p> <p>Drugs companies claim pharmacogenetics will enable them to identify this balance more efficiently in future, while slashing time and costs. </p> <p>Dr Ian Purvis of Glaxo Wellcome says: 'Identification of targets, and side effects of treatments, are fundamental parts of the research process. The impact of genetics is incredibly important.' </p> <p>This case was put by a Glaxo Wellcome scientist, Professor Allen Roses, in medical journal the Lancet last month. He explained that drugs used to be developed by identifying physical signs of disease - phenotypes - and working backwards to produce a treatment. This was then trialled among patients with that phenotype. Now, he says, 'snip maps' have been developed, charting the hundreds of thousands of snips which have so far been discovered, and their meaning. A patient's genetic information can be scanned for snips, and their response to a drug predicted. </p> <p>This has big implications for R&amp;D. The cost and size of Phase III trials can be reduced because companies could identify which patients responded in earlier phases, screen their genotypes and recruit only those patients with appropriate similar profiles. The same applies for testing for side effects. </p> <p>The vision of tailoring drugs individually is beguiling. However, there are several hurdles. First, genetics will make drug discovery more complicated; this impacts on cost, and the timescale in which they can be delivered is unclear. </p> <p>For example, says Weinshilboum, ethnic groups with different genotypes may respond differently to drugs. </p> <p>At one level these are fairly crude distinctions. While researching drugs for leukaemia, he found that polymorphisms in Asian people made them less able to metabolise the drug, so they required higher doses. But the dosage for Asians would be harmful or fatal to a European, who would metabolise the drug more quickly. </p> <p>Some biotechnology companies are sceptical about the impact of pharmacogenetics on trials. Its most useful application will be, they argue, in the initial discovery of drugs. Biotechnology companies may have a vested interest here - drug discovery is where they focus their energies. </p> <p>Dr Raj Parekh of biotech company Oxford Glycosciences believes this is only the tip of the iceberg. The complexity will increase all the time, he says. 'We know that different racial groups have different genotypes. But in Europe and America there has been such interbreeding that the genetic complexity will threaten the economics of trialling.' </p> <p>Parakh points out that if, in a trial, five polymorphisms underlying a disease were identified, that would increase the sample from, say, 1,000 patients to 120,000. </p> <p>This leads to another problem - the fragmentation of diseases and patient populations. Nick Edwards, a partner at Andersen Consulting, says these dynamics could change our entire concept of disease. Some diseases have simple genetic causes. For example, haemophilia is identified with a single polymorphism. At the other extreme, schizophrenia could have more than 20 - indicating a class of conditions with different causes. </p> <p>The promise of genetics is to increase the current 400 disease targets which make up the pharmacopoeia - or body of medicine for which treatments have been developed - to some 10,000. </p> <p>But many conditions within this 10,000 will be sub-divisions of conditions we now believe to be one disease. These subsets will have smaller patient groups. So the question becomes: how many of the new targets will have genetic causes simple enough to make it worth the drugs companies' while investing in them? </p> <p>The economies of scale which underpin development of blockbuster drugs such as Zantac or Losec which treat seemingly homogenous conditions will alter. Edwards believes the way forward will be to identify the conditions which can be worked on, and discard those that are not cost-effective. </p> <p>But pharmaceuticals companies point out that while there may be a fragmentation in markets, the value of the products will increase because genetic development will make them highly effective for those they are developed to treat. </p> <p>'We may lose market share, but we will be able to charge premium prices for treatments which are far more effective than medicines have been in the past,' says one senior R&amp;D scientist. </p> <p>One example of this, as ABN Amro biotechnology analyst Nick Woolfe points out, is a breast cancer treatment called Herceptin, developed by US biotech company Genentech and Roche. </p> <p>The drug is aimed at women whose cancer is caused by their gene HER2 being overactive. However, only 35 per cent of women with breast cancer have this problem. Herceptin can therefore only be marketed at a third of the breast cancer population. </p> <p>Herceptin is estimated to have been prescribed to 15 per cent of those women with breast cancer caused by the HER2 gene - a high penetration rate compared with the 5 per cent sale achieved by non genetically targeted drugs. Nevertheless, Herceptin has annual sales of around $200m, making it a blockbuster seller, albeit by a different route. </p> <p>So, although the revenues from drug development are likely to be more narrowly based than in the past, companies can offset high-cost development with high prices. Conversely, they can find new applications, and new patient populations for old drugs at negligible cost.</p>",

So the question becomes: how many of the new targets will have genetic causes simple enough to make it worth the drugs companies' while investing in them? The economies of scale which underpin development of blockbuster drugs such as Zantac or Losec which treat seemingly homogenous conditions will alter. Edwards believes the way forward will be to identify the conditions which can be worked on, and discard those that are not cost-effective. But pharmaceuticals companies point out that while there may be a fragmentation in markets, the value of the products will increase because genetic development will make them highly effective for those they are developed to treat. 'We may lose market share, but we will be able to charge premium prices for treatments which are far more effective than medicines have been in the past,' says one senior R&amp;D scientist. One example of this, as ABN Amro biotechnology analyst Nick Woolfe points out, is a breast cancer treatment called Herceptin, developed by US biotech company Genentech and Roche. The drug is aimed at women whose cancer is caused by their gene HER2 being overactive. However, only 35 per cent of women with breast cancer have this problem. Herceptin can therefore only be marketed at a third of the breast cancer population. Herceptin is estimated to have been prescribed to 15 per cent of those women with breast cancer caused by the HER2 gene - a high penetration rate compared with the 5 per cent sale achieved by non genetically targeted drugs. Nevertheless, Herceptin has annual sales of around $200m, making it a blockbuster seller, albeit by a different route. So, although the revenues from drug development are likely to be more narrowly based than in the past, companies can offset high-cost development with high prices. Conversely, they can find new applications, and new patient populations for old drugs at negligible cost.",

Some may call her dedicated, others ambitious; she claims she is now merely 'focused'. Surely someone with such rigid discipline is equally severe with her finances? 'I'm not actually.' She laughs and positions her legs in a way that only someone with 25 years of training and extreme agility is able to. 'I'm organised about lots of things in my life but I have a bit of a blind spot about money. I don't really check bank statements. It's partly being busy, but it's also not really wanting to know. I could not tell you what I've got in my bank account and I don't want to know. I always expect that it's going to be a dire story, so I don't look.' It's a hangover from being young and in debt, she explains. It is a myth, though, that dancers don't eat because they have no money. According to Deborah, dancers who survive on lettuce leaves do it to 'stay thin'. Not this dancer. Deborah's idea of a treat is to 'go round the corner and have a cappuccino with cake or a bagel and then look at clothes and shoe shops. Regular girly things. I love clothes.' The bank manager is unlikely to be worrying her too much at the moment. Apart from a punishing dancing schedule of principal roles, Deborah is an active member of the Arts Council and sits on boards including the South Bank Centre. She also writes and makes television and radio appearances. Deborah recognises that she has to be highly organised to hold so many positions. 'I am organised - it's down to a puritanical upbringing, I suppose. I don't like to let people down.' But, she claims, these organisational skills really do not run to personal finance, so she has an accountant. 'He invests in things for me and I'm very grateful. It has become a bit of a game in itself. You know, how much can I put in the pot? Because otherwise I would just spend it.' The puritanical upbringing she refers to was 'middle-England working class', as one of four daughters. 'The women have always managed the budget. The men would bring the money home on Fridays and give it to the wife. My mum has never been overdrawn in her life and never borrowed money. When she brought us up, what you had in your purse was what you spent.' Deborah admits that frugality has skipped a generation. 'I don't like overdrafts, but I'm perfectly happy to borrow on credit cards even when I've got the money.' She adds: 'I like to have the rainy day bit. For me, the bleakest feeling is not having something to fall back on.' The duration of a dancer's working life is bound to be uncertain. According to Deborah: 'You become less flexible, have to work harder to maintain fitness, and your injuries repair more slowly. Your attention shifts too. You become a woman in a big world, not a kid who's focused exclusively on dance. And then there's the competition. There are dancers joining the company who are 20 years younger than me. If you think how much faster sprinters are than 20 years ago, think how much higher ballet dancers jump these days. You rely on experience which they don't have yet, and that's all.'

One of the most cost-effective habits, on a pounds versus damage-to-health basis, is smoking.

It might warm your heart further to know that 80 per cent of your money will go to the Treasury, and 5 per cent of that directly to the NHS. So, when they switch on the respirator at the side of your bed, you will have paid for it yourself.</p> <p>Illegal drugs are not necessarily more habit-forming. Cocaine is psychologically addictive, but has few withdrawal symptoms. A gram costs \u00a350 and a committed user might snort more than one per day. Crack is chronically addictive, but the difference is that addicts will smoke as many rocks (at \u00a320 each) as they can buy.</p> <p>However, the defining habit-forming drug is heroin. Such habits need to be fed by smoking or injecting the drug. Chasing the dragon may not cost much at first (kitchen foil, \u00a31.50; lighter, \u00a31; \u00a320 bag of heroin per week), but the law of diminishing returns is harshly applied.</p> <p>Heroin is cheaper in cities such as London and Liverpool, where \u00a35 bags are available. Prices depend on supply, so they may fluctuate, but trends suggest that heroin is becoming ever cheaper: in the 50s, William Burroughs would pay $2 for a grain containing two hits ($14, or \u00a39 in today's money). A full-blown intravenous habit can cost in the region of \u00a320,000 annually.</p> <p>The cost of a habit can become a life-or-death equation. In 1997, there were 255 heroin-related deaths - but of Britain's one in four smoking adults, 120,000 will die of a smoking-related disease every year.</p> <p>If you wish to straighten yourself out, there are three options. Go it alone, go to a private clinic, or get on to a detox scheme. The first requires a will of iron, the second \u00a32,000 per week, while your fellow taxpayers chip in for the third. However, as Charlie Parker noted: 'They can take it out of your body, but they can't take it out of your mind.'</p> <p><b>Annual cost of a drug habit</b> <br> Nicotine \u00a31,500 <br>(\u00a31,200 of which goes to the government) <br> Cocaine \u00a318,000 <br> Crack no upper limit Heroin \u00a31,000 to \u00a320,000 <br> Rehab up to \u00a330,000</p>",

Once you are in the vice-like grip of nicotine addiction, you will be spending just \u00a34.20 a day for 20 gaspers. It might warm your heart further to know that 80 per cent of your money will go to the Treasury, and 5 per cent of that directly to the NHS. So, when they switch on the respirator at the side of your bed, you will have paid for it yourself. Illegal drugs are not necessarily more habit-forming. Cocaine is psychologically addictive, but has few withdrawal symptoms. A gram costs \u00a350 and a committed user might snort more than one per day. Crack is chronically addictive, but the difference is that addicts will smoke as many rocks (at \u00a320 each) as they can buy. However, the defining habit-forming drug is heroin. Such habits need to be fed by smoking or injecting the drug. Chasing the dragon may not cost much at first (kitchen foil, \u00a31.50; lighter, \u00a31; \u00a320 bag of heroin per week), but the law of diminishing returns is harshly applied. Heroin is cheaper in cities such as London and Liverpool, where \u00a35 bags are available. Prices depend on supply, so they may fluctuate, but trends suggest that heroin is becoming ever cheaper: in the 50s, William Burroughs would pay $2 for a grain containing two hits ($14, or \u00a39 in today's money). A full-blown intravenous habit can cost in the region of \u00a320,000 annually. The cost of a habit can become a life-or-death equation. In 1997, there were 255 heroin-related deaths - but of Britain's one in four smoking adults, 120,000 will die of a smoking-related disease every year. If you wish to straighten yourself out, there are three options. Go it alone, go to a private clinic, or get on to a detox scheme. The first requires a will of iron, the second \u00a32,000 per week, while your fellow taxpayers chip in for the third. However, as Charlie Parker noted: 'They can take it out of your body, but they can't take it out of your mind.' Annual cost of a drug habit Nicotine \u00a31,500 (\u00a31,200 of which goes to the government) Cocaine \u00a318,000 Crack no upper limit Heroin \u00a31,000 to \u00a320,000 Rehab up to \u00a330,000",

By offering an average discount of 17 per cent off UK prices, and a servicing and warranty repair service that is particularly likely to appeal to women, Virgincars aims to become the UK's biggest car retailer, with 24,000 sales in the first year. </p> <p>It is already possible to buy cars at massive discounts to the recommended UK prices through the Which? website <a href=\"http://www.carbusters.com\">www.carbusters.com</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.oneswoop.com\">www.oneswoop.com</a>. So how do the sites compare? It is difficult to compare on a like-for-like basis (prices are shown in the table below), because each site obtains cars from different outlets in different countries, and may not be able to provide the precise model you are looking for. </p> <p>Also, Virgin includes all 'on the road' costs, including registration, road tax, delivery, and even a tank of petrol. Carbusters includes 'on the road' costs, but excludes a \u00a3200 admin fee. </p> <p>Oneswoop does not include any 'on the road' costs in its initial indicative price, and therefore looks much cheaper. Even its indicative 'on the road' price (described on the site as the Oneswoop guideline price) is an average of prices charged by different sources around Europe for cars closest to your specification. To get a final 'on the road' quote for the car you want to buy from Oneswoop or Carbusters, you pay a \u00a310 fee. Virgin charges nothing. And while Oneswoop requires payment in euros, Virgin and Carbusters take sterling. </p> <p>Each site offers different ranges and models. Virgin currently offers cars from 14 manufacturers, and lists most ranges and models, although many were not available on the days we visited the site. Oneswoop misses out on stalwarts like Renault, Toyota and Fiat but did offer a lot of ranges and models for the 10 makers that it does sell. Carbusters was probably the most disappointing. Although it offers 13 marques, its choice of ranges is limited. Its Ford offering, for example, is limited to Focus, Puma and Fiesta. </p> <p>However, Virgin's extra services are likely to be the biggest winning factor. All cars sold by Virgin Cars are covered for three years by its servicing offer - Virgin Cars @ Your Service. Owners simply call the service with their registration number, and Virgin will identify which service the car needs and transfer the owner to the Virgin Cars Service Centre to fix a price for the work and arrange a date for the car to be picked up. </p> <p>James Pillar, a spokesman for Virgin Cars, says a bulk servicing deal will result in prices 15 per cent lower than standard garage charges. </p> <p>But the deciding factor could be Virgin's offer to buy your existing car, provided it is less than five years old and has less than 60,000 miles on the clock. The site includes a 'used price indicator', and Virgin will ask you to pay for an AA check costing \u00a359 if you decide to go ahead. </p> <p>The only way a traditional dealer can tempt you across his threshold now is with the offer of a test drive, but Pillar says Virgin Cars even plans to spoil that ploy. 'We hope to offer a range of the most popular cars in the next few months so that people can test drive through Virgin as well.' </p>",

And while Oneswoop requires payment in euros, Virgin and Carbusters take sterling. Each site offers different ranges and models. Virgin currently offers cars from 14 manufacturers, and lists most ranges and models, although many were not available on the days we visited the site. Oneswoop misses out on stalwarts like Renault, Toyota and Fiat but did offer a lot of ranges and models for the 10 makers that it does sell. Carbusters was probably the most disappointing. Although it offers 13 marques, its choice of ranges is limited. Its Ford offering, for example, is limited to Focus, Puma and Fiesta. However, Virgin's extra services are likely to be the biggest winning factor. All cars sold by Virgin Cars are covered for three years by its servicing offer - Virgin Cars @ Your Service. Owners simply call the service with their registration number, and Virgin will identify which service the car needs and transfer the owner to the Virgin Cars Service Centre to fix a price for the work and arrange a date for the car to be picked up. James Pillar, a spokesman for Virgin Cars, says a bulk servicing deal will result in prices 15 per cent lower than standard garage charges. But the deciding factor could be Virgin's offer to buy your existing car, provided it is less than five years old and has less than 60,000 miles on the clock. The site includes a 'used price indicator', and Virgin will ask you to pay for an AA check costing \u00a359 if you decide to go ahead. The only way a traditional dealer can tempt you across his threshold now is with the offer of a test drive, but Pillar says Virgin Cars even plans to spoil that ploy. 'We hope to offer a range of the most popular cars in the next few months so that people can test drive through Virgin as well.'",

      "body": "<p>If you think buying a beach hut is a cheap alternative to carting your family abroad for their summer holiday, prepare for a shock. </p> <p>A shortage of beach huts coming onto the market has caused prices to spiral over the past few years, and in some areas, a well appointed wooden shelter with a good view of the sea can cost as much as \u00a330,000. </p> <p>Southwold in Suffolk is possibly the most expensive place to buy at the moment. Sonia Moore of Southwold estate agent H A Adnams says huts on the town's North Beach cost about \u00a36,000, but if you prefer Centre Cliff or East Cliff you will have to pay \u00a312,000 to \u00a315,000. And a hut on the more prestigious Gun Hill or Constitution Hill will set you back up to \u00a330,000. </p> <p> 'They come with calor gas stoves, items of crockery and cutlery,' she says 'but you are not allowed to sleep in them and there's no running water - just standpipes within easy reach.' </p> <p>Elsewhere on the coast, the average price is about \u00a36,000, while a 5' by 5' hut on Bournemouth's seven-mile stretch of golden sand is likely to cost less than \u00a31,000. However, unless you strike lucky in finding a hut owner who is prepared to sell directly to you, you could be in for a long wait. Most local councils have lists for people interested in buying a beach hut, and Dave Reed, seafront operations manager for Bournemouth Council, says thousands of people are now on the list he manages: 'If you put your name down now, we may be giving you a call in about eight years' time.' </p> <p>The annual running costs can also be quite steep. Most huts are built on council-owned land, and are therefore subject to annual licences, site rent or council tax if the property is more substantial. Site licences in Lyme Regis cost from \u00a3200 to \u00a31,000 a year, depending on the position and size of the beach hut, while in Bournemouth you will pay \u00a3420, discounted to \u00a3395 for early settlement. And even if you paint or woodstain your hut every year, the ravages of sea and salt air mean you will probably have to replace bits of your hut from time to time. </p> <p>Sheila Brackley, a pensioner who has owned a beach hut at Hunstanton on the North Norfolk Coast for 36 years, says: 'We've virtually replaced the whole hut because we've owned it since the kids were small. But it's been very good value. My children loved it when they were small, and their children, too.' </p> <p> <strong> Bournemouth</strong> </p> <p> The council runs a slick operation with 1,343 huts, CCTV to prevent vandalism, four barbecue sites and a train service which runs along the length of the prom.

      "bodyText": "If you think buying a beach hut is a cheap alternative to carting your family abroad for their summer holiday, prepare for a shock. A shortage of beach huts coming onto the market has caused prices to spiral over the past few years, and in some areas, a well appointed wooden shelter with a good view of the sea can cost as much as \u00a330,000. Southwold in Suffolk is possibly the most expensive place to buy at the moment. Sonia Moore of Southwold estate agent H A Adnams says huts on the town's North Beach cost about \u00a36,000, but if you prefer Centre Cliff or East Cliff you will have to pay \u00a312,000 to \u00a315,000. And a hut on the more prestigious Gun Hill or Constitution Hill will set you back up to \u00a330,000. 'They come with calor gas stoves, items of crockery and cutlery,' she says 'but you are not allowed to sleep in them and there's no running water - just standpipes within easy reach.' Elsewhere on the coast, the average price is about \u00a36,000, while a 5' by 5' hut on Bournemouth's seven-mile stretch of golden sand is likely to cost less than \u00a31,000. However, unless you strike lucky in finding a hut owner who is prepared to sell directly to you, you could be in for a long wait. Most local councils have lists for people interested in buying a beach hut, and Dave Reed, seafront operations manager for Bournemouth Council, says thousands of people are now on the list he manages: 'If you put your name down now, we may be giving you a call in about eight years' time.' The annual running costs can also be quite steep. Most huts are built on council-owned land, and are therefore subject to annual licences, site rent or council tax if the property is more substantial. Site licences in Lyme Regis cost from \u00a3200 to \u00a31,000 a year, depending on the position and size of the beach hut, while in Bournemouth you will pay \u00a3420, discounted to \u00a3395 for early settlement. And even if you paint or woodstain your hut every year, the ravages of sea and salt air mean you will probably have to replace bits of your hut from time to time. Sheila Brackley, a pensioner who has owned a beach hut at Hunstanton on the North Norfolk Coast for 36 years, says: 'We've virtually replaced the whole hut because we've owned it since the kids were small. But it's been very good value. My children loved it when they were small, and their children, too.' Bournemouth The council runs a slick operation with 1,343 huts, CCTV to prevent vandalism, four barbecue sites and a train service which runs along the length of the prom.

      "body": "<p><strong> Elizabeth</strong> C4 </p> <p><strong> Elizabeth Taylor - England's Other Elizabeth</strong> BBC1 </p> <p><strong> Reputations: Liberace</strong> BBC2 </p> <p>By the time she had reached her sixties, 'Elizabeth had ceased to be a mere queen,' said Dr David Starkey in the final part of his excellent, illuminating dramatised documentary, <strong> Elizabeth</strong> on Channel 4. By now, in the autumn of her reign, Liz One was simply known as the pop-starry Gloriana, 'England's national icon'. </p> <p>Predictably, Channel 4's Gloriana was embodied by an enigmatically pale, pointy-faced, bewigged thespiana, ruffed and ready to perform the dumbshow Elizabeth we all recognise as the greatest, most abiding clich\u00e9 of royalty: a woman sat stock-still and staring on a big posh chair, silent, shimmeringly bejewelled and super-haughty. Given that even the most resourceful actor lacks the opportunity to get hands-on experience as a monarch, this must necessarily pass for method-regal. But the whole effect was camped up even more by having Elizabeth played by Karen Archer glowering against a backdrop of 100 or so guttering candles, thus making her look like a bedraggled Sting in the video for 'Every Breath You Take'. Altogether 'very Eighties', if not entirely 1580s. </p> <p>Growing up in the latter part of the twentieth century as a Karen isn't likely to give you airs and graces, but perhaps to be christened Elizabeth automatically brings with it pretensions to grandeur - inside every petit bourgeois Liz from the 'burbs, is there a great big grand old Queen bursting to get out? Either way, in a week when the woman BBC1's Omnibus Special had dubbed <strong> England's Other Elizabeth</strong> was being quite successfully upstaged all over the media by Elizabeth Hurley (England's understudy 'Other Elizabeth'?), Elizabeth Taylor, from Hampstead via Beverly Hills, demonstrated her right-on royal attitude by keeping the slavering celebrity hordes waiting at a BFI dinner in her honour. Except that royalty wouldn't dream of ever keeping anybody waiting. </p> <p>Funnily enough - and it came to me in a blinding flash - on Omnibus, the tireless, tearful, charity-working power-victim heroine-turned Dame looked like precisely what Diana might have grown into. Though brunette and bloated, there were moments in Friday's soft focus interview that were pure Panorama -era Diana - less a flesh-and-blood human being than an immaculate celebrity conception. And while she must surely have an interior life of some sort, there was little evidence of it here, not even when, voice quavering, eyes brimming, she sobbed over the death of Mike Todd. </p> <p>Compare and contrast Liz's 'we said goodbye five times. He'd go downstairs and come back up again... the following morning my secretary and my doctor walked into the room... he was dead ' with Diana's famous 'yes, I loved him...' speech. These were both first-rate poor-me oratories from women who were perhaps too busy performing love ever to really feel it. </p> <p>But while I remain wholly fascinated by Diana, it is probably treason to admit to never having been remotely captivated by even the idea of Elizabeth Taylor and much less the reality. I'm tired of the tyranny of her received 'beauty' - that spooky, preternatural prettiness (the 'mind of a child inside the body of a woman') that had long since evolved into a blowsy, weak-chinned, Rank starlet cuteness by the time she was in her twenties. </p> <p>And I never cared a fig for the interminable Richard Burton shenanigans in which a pair of talent-squandering narcissists demonstrated nothing much more than a very great love of each other's fame. And who ever cared about the vulgar (though admittedly quite impressively Elizabethan) diamond love-tokens? Or the accumulated dullness of all those other tawdry husbands? And the sense that her extraordinary range of illnesses seem like a subconscious effort to ensure she remains both uninsurable and unemployable. After all, it's easy enough to overlook her many shortcomings as an actress when other distractions include not only a handspan waist, heaving embonpoint and flashing lilac eyes, but Paul Newman, Monty Clift and James Dean too. This is one smart Dame: no acting, no bad reviews! A clip from an old guest appearance on the US soap General Hospital saw her fluffing her lines and apologising to a plainly awestruck cast and crew with the words 'Shit. I'm sorry. I'm not used to acting'. </p> <p>So it was a shame that this Omnibus concentrated on the acting when Liz surely received what she recently referred to as her 'dameship' for sterling work with the American Foundation for Aids research ('we've raised about $160 million...'), not for her acting or her nuptial profligacy. But perhaps she could only be persuaded to speak, ever-vacillating between faltering and feisty, with eyes locked-on to camera like violet missiles, by concentrating mostly on the scripted dramas. None the less, the only people drummed up to sing her praises in this department were Burton (on Parkinson, in 1974), Angela Lansbury (who worked with her on National Velvet ), an academic from the Film Studies Program at Wesleyan University and old mucker Shirley MacLaine. </p> <p>There was much nonsense about 'instinctive acting' and the observations (though not from Liz) that 'if you really surrender and get out of your own way, particularly in a close-up, then an audience will see your soul...' But all I could see was Academy Award-winning lighting highlighting the Lux creaminess of skin and glycerine-dewiness of eye. The best bit came when MacLaine hinted at a project currently evolving somewhere way beyond Planet Camp. Entitled These Old Broads and written by Carrie Fisher (for MacLaine and 'Debbie [Reynolds], Betty Bacall, Julie Andrews and Elizabeth...'), Shirley observed drily that Liz would only have to 'play the part in bed, so I think she's insurable'. After the inevitable celestial celebrity showdown, where she'll get to meet Diana ('hey! you, get off of my cloud'), what's the betting that Elizabeth is remembered (by my generation at least) chiefly for her friendship with another inhabitant of celebrity Never-Neverland, Michael Jackson. And though this is the one relationship of hers that really does intrigue me, unfortunately Jacko remained off-limits on Omnibus . </p> <p>In the same way that so much of Liz's life is such familiar viewing, you probably think you've seen most of Michael's, too. But though we're au courant with 'Ben' and Thriller and the Brits appearance, I had never before seen the slightly surreal film footage of a teenage Jackson visiting Lord Montagu's famous car museum at Beaulieu. Here he was captured enjoying a vintage set of wheels alongside the marabou and rhinestone-wearing, candelabra-loving, not-awfully-heterosexual pop-classic pianist, Liberace, plus Liberace's live-in lover-cum-chauffeur whose face had been remodelled to resemble the pianist's own gurning, twinklingly-youthful visage. And all this quite by chance! It is surely safe to say that Beaulieu will not have seen anything like the same level of sniggering, snuggling, scent-impregnated quiveringly fruit-flavoured high-voltage preeningly-queeny celebrityhood either before or since. </p> <p>Interestingly, just as during England's Other Elizabeth, I wanted to know a great deal less about the subject's work and much more about her fame, so with<strong> Reputations</strong> , I wanted somebody who really knew to tell me how good a pianist Liberace was, or might have been, and why he failed to follow a career which saw him appear as guest soloist with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the age of 21. Instead we got a dismissive 'talented, but not brilliant' from unlikely narrator Denis Lawson, far too much footage of his mother and way too little of his murky \u00e9minence grise and brother, George, who had first encouraged him to play ragtime in Wisconsin nightclubs. </p> <p>Anyway, by the end we were shown pictures of Freddie Mercury, Elton and - blimey! - Michael Jackson and told by biographer Ray Mungo that Liberace's legacy had been to make it 'all right to be a screaming queen onstage'.

      "bodyText": "Elizabeth C4 Elizabeth Taylor - England's Other Elizabeth BBC1 Reputations: Liberace BBC2 By the time she had reached her sixties, 'Elizabeth had ceased to be a mere queen,' said Dr David Starkey in the final part of his excellent, illuminating dramatised documentary, Elizabeth on Channel 4. By now, in the autumn of her reign, Liz One was simply known as the pop-starry Gloriana, 'England's national icon'. Predictably, Channel 4's Gloriana was embodied by an enigmatically pale, pointy-faced, bewigged thespiana, ruffed and ready to perform the dumbshow Elizabeth we all recognise as the greatest, most abiding clich\u00e9 of royalty: a woman sat stock-still and staring on a big posh chair, silent, shimmeringly bejewelled and super-haughty. Given that even the most resourceful actor lacks the opportunity to get hands-on experience as a monarch, this must necessarily pass for method-regal. But the whole effect was camped up even more by having Elizabeth played by Karen Archer glowering against a backdrop of 100 or so guttering candles, thus making her look like a bedraggled Sting in the video for 'Every Breath You Take'. Altogether 'very Eighties', if not entirely 1580s. Growing up in the latter part of the twentieth century as a Karen isn't likely to give you airs and graces, but perhaps to be christened Elizabeth automatically brings with it pretensions to grandeur - inside every petit bourgeois Liz from the 'burbs, is there a great big grand old Queen bursting to get out? Either way, in a week when the woman BBC1's Omnibus Special had dubbed England's Other Elizabeth was being quite successfully upstaged all over the media by Elizabeth Hurley (England's understudy 'Other Elizabeth'?), Elizabeth Taylor, from Hampstead via Beverly Hills, demonstrated her right-on royal attitude by keeping the slavering celebrity hordes waiting at a BFI dinner in her honour. Except that royalty wouldn't dream of ever keeping anybody waiting. Funnily enough - and it came to me in a blinding flash - on Omnibus, the tireless, tearful, charity-working power-victim heroine-turned Dame looked like precisely what Diana might have grown into. Though brunette and bloated, there were moments in Friday's soft focus interview that were pure Panorama -era Diana - less a flesh-and-blood human being than an immaculate celebrity conception. And while she must surely have an interior life of some sort, there was little evidence of it here, not even when, voice quavering, eyes brimming, she sobbed over the death of Mike Todd. Compare and contrast Liz's 'we said goodbye five times. He'd go downstairs and come back up again... the following morning my secretary and my doctor walked into the room... he was dead ' with Diana's famous 'yes, I loved him...' speech. These were both first-rate poor-me oratories from women who were perhaps too busy performing love ever to really feel it. But while I remain wholly fascinated by Diana, it is probably treason to admit to never having been remotely captivated by even the idea of Elizabeth Taylor and much less the reality. I'm tired of the tyranny of her received 'beauty' - that spooky, preternatural prettiness (the 'mind of a child inside the body of a woman') that had long since evolved into a blowsy, weak-chinned, Rank starlet cuteness by the time she was in her twenties. And I never cared a fig for the interminable Richard Burton shenanigans in which a pair of talent-squandering narcissists demonstrated nothing much more than a very great love of each other's fame. And who ever cared about the vulgar (though admittedly quite impressively Elizabethan) diamond love-tokens? Or the accumulated dullness of all those other tawdry husbands? And the sense that her extraordinary range of illnesses seem like a subconscious effort to ensure she remains both uninsurable and unemployable. After all, it's easy enough to overlook her many shortcomings as an actress when other distractions include not only a handspan waist, heaving embonpoint and flashing lilac eyes, but Paul Newman, Monty Clift and James Dean too. This is one smart Dame: no acting, no bad reviews! A clip from an old guest appearance on the US soap General Hospital saw her fluffing her lines and apologising to a plainly awestruck cast and crew with the words 'Shit. I'm sorry. I'm not used to acting'. So it was a shame that this Omnibus concentrated on the acting when Liz surely received what she recently referred to as her 'dameship' for sterling work with the American Foundation for Aids research ('we've raised about $160 million...'), not for her acting or her nuptial profligacy. But perhaps she could only be persuaded to speak, ever-vacillating between faltering and feisty, with eyes locked-on to camera like violet missiles, by concentrating mostly on the scripted dramas. None the less, the only people drummed up to sing her praises in this department were Burton (on Parkinson, in 1974), Angela Lansbury (who worked with her on National Velvet ), an academic from the Film Studies Program at Wesleyan University and old mucker Shirley MacLaine. There was much nonsense about 'instinctive acting' and the observations (though not from Liz) that 'if you really surrender and get out of your own way, particularly in a close-up, then an audience will see your soul...' But all I could see was Academy Award-winning lighting highlighting the Lux creaminess of skin and glycerine-dewiness of eye. The best bit came when MacLaine hinted at a project currently evolving somewhere way beyond Planet Camp. Entitled These Old Broads and written by Carrie Fisher (for MacLaine and 'Debbie [Reynolds], Betty Bacall, Julie Andrews and Elizabeth...'), Shirley observed drily that Liz would only have to 'play the part in bed, so I think she's insurable'. After the inevitable celestial celebrity showdown, where she'll get to meet Diana ('hey! you, get off of my cloud'), what's the betting that Elizabeth is remembered (by my generation at least) chiefly for her friendship with another inhabitant of celebrity Never-Neverland, Michael Jackson. And though this is the one relationship of hers that really does intrigue me, unfortunately Jacko remained off-limits on Omnibus . In the same way that so much of Liz's life is such familiar viewing, you probably think you've seen most of Michael's, too. But though we're au courant with 'Ben' and Thriller and the Brits appearance, I had never before seen the slightly surreal film footage of a teenage Jackson visiting Lord Montagu's famous car museum at Beaulieu. Here he was captured enjoying a vintage set of wheels alongside the marabou and rhinestone-wearing, candelabra-loving, not-awfully-heterosexual pop-classic pianist, Liberace, plus Liberace's live-in lover-cum-chauffeur whose face had been remodelled to resemble the pianist's own gurning, twinklingly-youthful visage. And all this quite by chance! It is surely safe to say that Beaulieu will not have seen anything like the same level of sniggering, snuggling, scent-impregnated quiveringly fruit-flavoured high-voltage preeningly-queeny celebrityhood either before or since. Interestingly, just as during England's Other Elizabeth, I wanted to know a great deal less about the subject's work and much more about her fame, so with Reputations , I wanted somebody who really knew to tell me how good a pianist Liberace was, or might have been, and why he failed to follow a career which saw him appear as guest soloist with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the age of 21. Instead we got a dismissive 'talented, but not brilliant' from unlikely narrator Denis Lawson, far too much footage of his mother and way too little of his murky \u00e9minence grise and brother, George, who had first encouraged him to play ragtime in Wisconsin nightclubs. Anyway, by the end we were shown pictures of Freddie Mercury, Elton and - blimey! - Michael Jackson and told by biographer Ray Mungo that Liberace's legacy had been to make it 'all right to be a screaming queen onstage'. Which doesn't seem like much of a legacy, frankly, for a man with a museum and, just like Liz, a foundation of his own. Having watched the programme on tape, afterwards I hopped through the channels and found the charmingly warm, genial host of the daytime quiz Supermarket Sweep asking his contestants to identify 'scrag, linzertorte and farl'. I don't suppose Dale Winton has ever remembered Liberace in his prayers, but I bet he just adores that darling Dame.",

Such a picture is David Koepp's uninvitingly titled Stir of Echoes. Koepp scripted Jurassic Park and Mission: Impossible; his 1996 directorial debut, Trigger Effect, went straight to video here without creating a ripple; and all I'd heard of his second feature film was that it resembled The Sixth Sense. Well, it is a little like The Sixth Sense, and also a little like The Shining. But it's based on a novel by Richard Matheson, published in the Fifties when Stephen King was still in primary school and years before M. Night Shyamalan was born. A specialist in horror, SF and the occult, Matheson wrote the best of Roger Corman's Poe movies, contributed to Twilight Zone and Star Trek, and turned his own books into such classics as The Incredible Shrinking Man (the paperback of which a babysitter reads in Stir of Echoes) and Spielberg's Duel . </p> <p>The movie takes place in a working-class Polish-American suburb of Chicago where electricity repairman Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) and his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) live in a rented house with Jake (Zachary David Cope), their five-year-old son. Jake talks to what initially seems to be an imaginary friend called Samantha, but it transpires that he's a 'receiver', a person with X-ray vision in touch with strange forces. His father develops similar, though more intermittent, powers when at the end of a party he drunkenly agrees to be hypnotised by his aggressive sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana Douglas), partly as a way of showing up her New Age mysticism. In this bravura sequence we are grasped with a steely grip that doesn't let up for the next 90 minutes. Lisa tells Tom to shut his eyes and imagine he's in an old picture palace. It's painted black. He's on his own. His seat starts floating towards the screen that has one word on it that he can't make out - until he's almost up against it. The word is SLEEP. This is our own dream experience of being at the movies. </p> <p>Under hypnosis, Tom sees strange, violent images concerning a woman and his house, and when he awakes he continues to be haunted, first seeing a ghost, then experiencing premonitions. Is he in touch with something in his past, or have he and his son been brought into dangerous communion with a recent local tragedy? I will say no more. This is a constantly surprising and frightening picture. But what makes it a little special is the way Koepp roots the story in a convincingly etched blue-collar community and has the protagonist and his wife engaged in a real marriage. Unlike the family in The Shining, this couple really care for each other and their child, and unlike Nicholson's madness in Kubrick's picture, Bacon's is induced by a sense of unidentifiable moral responsibility. When her husband becomes steadily unhinged, we understand Maggie's pain and sense of helplessness. All the performances are of a high order, and only very occasionally does Koepp strike a false note.</p>",

In such films as Monsieur Hire, The Hairdresser's Husband, Tandem and Ridicule, his unhappy male protagonists are outsiders, drawn to women who mystify and disturb them. His characters are, in the words of Claude Beylie and Jacques Pinturault in their invaluable Les Matres du Cin\u00e9ma Fran\u00e7ais, 'fragile and vulnerable, immured in their solitude'. </p> <p>His latest picture, <strong> The Girl on the Bridge</strong> , is a bittersweet romantic comedy shot on location in Paris, Monte Carlo, San Remo, Athens and Istanbul in shimmering, high-contrast black-and-white. It begins on a bridge over the Seine where Gabor (Daniel Auteuil), a professional knife thrower, goes to recruit suicidal assistants for his act. He rescues the beautiful, promiscuous Ad\u00e8le (Vanessa Paradis) from the icy river and they bring each other luck as they perform increasingly dangerous acts in nightclubs around the Mediterranean and she follows his advice at the roulette table. They break up, go to pieces and inevitably meet again. It's a wispy affair, an extended anecdote that recalls La Baie des Anges , Jacques Demy's New Wave tale of amour fou between two gamblers on the Cte d'Azur, back in 1962. Auteuil and Paradis are an engaging pair and the knife-throwing scenes have a bizarre erotic power, as Leconte intends them to. </p> <p>You can hardly see the coffin of the current British cinema for the nails that have recently been driven into it, the latest of which is <strong> Honest</strong> , a comedy thriller set in 1968 London. It's directed by David A. Stewart of the Eurythmics, and stars Nicole Appleton, Natalie Appleton and Melanie Blatt, three quarters of the group All Saints. The girls play working-class East End sisters who support their crippled dad (James Cosmo) and get up gang boss Corin Redgrave's flaring nostrils by committing armed robberies dressed in identical grey suits, black ties and false moustaches - reservoir bitches, as it were. One of the girls hides stolen diamonds in a lava lamp belonging to an American Rhodes scholar (Peter Facinelli) who writes for Zero, a counter-cultural newspaper and has taken a fancy to her. There's a fashion photographer got up like David Hemmings in Blow-Up, a druggy midnight plunge into a Trafalgar Square fountain \u00e0 la Dolce Vita, and a climactic chase during a private view at a Mayfair art gallery of the sort featured in every Swinging London movie. This is a witless, half-baked enterprise, soulless and inert. Its spirit is perhaps summed up in the American's line: 'It's just a \u00a32 cab fare from Carnaby Street to Bethnal Green, but it's another world.' </p> <p>A good deal better is the FilmFour production <strong> Simon Magus</strong> , a first feature by writer-director Ben Hopkins, shot in Wales and set in mid- nineteenth century Poland. This is sub-Isaac Bashevis Singer stuff about a young Talmudic scholar (David Townsend) who seeks to preserve his remote Jewish community by acquiring land from the local German squire (Rutger Hauer) to build a station on the recently laid railway line. Unfortunately, a wealthy anti-Semitic entrepreneur (Sean McGinley) has similar ideas and conflict results. Standing between the Jewish and Gentile communities is Simon (Noah Taylor), a holy fool driven hither and yon by Satan (Ian Holm), but eventually using his magical powers and guile to help his fellow Jews and effect reconciliation. </p> <p>It's a likeable, good-looking picture with delightful performances from Hauer as the cultured, philo-Semitic, aristocratic poet and David de Keyser as an elderly rabbi. The movie bears the subtitle 'A Magical Tale From a Vanished World' and a final brief image of the wind shifting the soil anticipates the Holocaust that in less than a century will destroy this culture and send its few survivors into exile. </p> <p>Five years in the making, <strong> La Ciudad</strong> (The City) is written and directed by David Riker, an American who grew up in Europe, and is performed by an amateur cast of Hispanic Americans living in New York. Shot in a harsh monochrome, it has the raw texture of Italian neo-realistic films like Paisa and La Terra Trema, and tells four stories of exploitation and oppression, linked by people visiting a photographer's studio to have pictures taken to send home to Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Salvador. In one story, a man dies under a pile of old bricks he's refurbishing at 15 cents a time, still clutching a letter from his family in Latin America. In another, a boy gets lost trying to locate his new girlfriend in a labyrinthine New York. In the third, a man with TB living rough can't provide the proof of residence that will get his little daughter into a school. In the fourth, a sad seamstress in a sweatshop tries to raise money for her child's operation in Mexico. It's an uncompromising, heartbreaking picture about soluble problems. </p> <p>The Anglo-French-Hungarian <strong> The Monkey's Tale</strong> is a high-minded allegory about two tribes of apes and as poor an animated picture as I've seen these past five years. The one laugh it elicted was unintentional - the name of the animation director in the final credits is Ginger Gibbons. </p> <p>Were I to be in London next Saturday, I would be at the Royal Festival Hall seeing Kevin Brownlow's latest restoration of Abel Gance's silent Napoleon and listening to Carl Davis conducting live an extended version of his original score. However, by the time you read this, I will have skipped off, bucket and spade in one hand, typewriter in the other, and that delightfully lapidary sentence 'Philip French is on holiday' will be appearing at the foot of this column for the next month.</p>",

The Anglo-French-Hungarian The Monkey's Tale is a high-minded allegory about two tribes of apes and as poor an animated picture as I've seen these past five years. The one laugh it elicted was unintentional - the name of the animation director in the final credits is Ginger Gibbons. Were I to be in London next Saturday, I would be at the Royal Festival Hall seeing Kevin Brownlow's latest restoration of Abel Gance's silent Napoleon and listening to Carl Davis conducting live an extended version of his original score. However, by the time you read this, I will have skipped off, bucket and spade in one hand, typewriter in the other, and that delightfully lapidary sentence 'Philip French is on holiday' will be appearing at the foot of this column for the next month.",

The play is based on Gitta Sereny's penetrating study of the man who was first Hitler's architect, and later his Minister for Armaments. It is written by David Edgar, skilled and subtle as a dramatist and an adapter: it was he who gave us Nicholas Nickleby . It is directed by the master of the panoramic sweep and the telling detail, Trevor Nunn. Despite all this, the piece delivers no news. It is sometimes pedestrian, sometimes spectacular: it is not incisive or illuminating. </p> <p>In pursuit of the truth about the man who declared ignorance of Hitler's systematic genocide of the Jews and who nevertheless proclaimed his own feelings of guilt - 'I should have known. I could have known. I didn't know,' - Speer divides into two. First the protagonist gives an account of his life: father-fixated, flattered by Hitler's attention, rising rapidly and anxious. In the second half - almost a separate play - his life after imprisonment in Spandau is examined by others. In a lurid afterpiece, he is judged guilty. </p> <p>This twofold structure may be an attempt to suggest ambivalence. But it looks like a mistake: like doing everything at too great length. And the method of conveying information, in which first Speer and then his associates address the audience directly with their explanations of the action, is finger-waggingly obtrusive. The wish to instruct and a desire to display are at odds throughout. </p> <p>Some elements come across forcefully. At the play's centre are two tremendous performances. Roger Allam - a transforming and undersung actor - is a perfectly judged Hitler, a man who presents himself as more house-painter than hell-raiser, and who moves from sinister emollience and ingratiating chirpiness to a stooped and cranky figure, one palsied hand clenched trembling behind his back. Alex Jennings, the most effortlessly melodious actor since Gielgud, works on a knife edge between chilly composure and urbane charm. When either character bursts out - into anger or remorse - the effect is galvanic. </p> <p>There are arresting, sometimes revealing images. Against Ian MacNeill's effective cavern of a set, Speer's architectural creations are shown with the allure they must have held for a hungry crowd. Plumes of light shoot into the sky like fountains; his model of a rebuilt Berlin glows like a lunar landscape: Hitler and his entourage stumble through it with the blundering confidence of boy scouts. </p> <p>There are moments when Edgar's wit and Nunn's direction combine to acute effect. The meal at which Speer, fresh from Spandau, announces to his family that he is going to grant them a miserable future by dredging up the past in his memoirs, is staged like the Last Supper, with Speer's betrayal the more devastating because it is executed with a sort of innocence. He is seen - not for the first time - as having no sense of the effect of his actions. </p> <p>But magnetic staging does not amount to insight. And insight, analysis and revelation are the only reasons for staging a piece about Speer. We know the Nazis could project visual allure; we know Speer was a difficult case. And we know that while families were being wiped out, the men who gave the orders were stumbling about looking normal. In a banal illustration of the point, film from the concentration camps is from time to time played behind the action. It dwarfs everything. </p> <p>Suddenly the Barbican is being besieged by invention. <strong> Songs and Stories from Moby Dick</strong> is a vaulting multimedia show by the multi-talented American performer Laurie Anderson. It is nothing so daft as a musical staging of Melville's novel about whales and God and revenge: rather, it is a tribute to his imagination, and an evocation of the great associative roll of his writing. Anderson is like a spiky-haired, red-booted Prospero. She is a conjuror of seas and spirits and memories. She even carries her own version of Prospero's staff, an instrument called a 'talking stick' which she has designed herself: a digital turntable shaped like a wand, which looks like a harpoon and performs like a wireless. </p> <p>The early scenes of the show are dominated by a thrumming, buzzing noise, like the sound of a giant wasp, and by a huge grey and white back-projection of the ocean. Then come the wail of bagpipes and an eerie blue light; later, giant pages from the book appear on the screen turning over each other like waves; golden letters tumble off the text and fly like spray in all directions; as the entire stage becomes mottled black and white, as if it were a marble hall, you read words about the marbled appearance of the sea. There are graphic illustrations of passages and characters from the novel. Captain Ahab capers around in a stovepipe hat like a demented Rumplestiltskin. Pip the cabin boy is given his own song, rendered by Anderson in a piping voice, and is swallowed up by an ocean in which the fat mouths of fishes open like flowers. </p> <p>There are also moments which are pure Anderson. Some of these are hippie dreams; some of them are sharp. She says she thinks that Moby Dick is about Big Heads - humans have them and so do whales. She unnerves you with switches of perspective - perching in a huge armchair, lolling on a tiny one. She brings you the creaks and clanks of a ship and the clicking sounds of whales; she shows you how a pillow can look like the face of a rock. </p> <p>Richard Cocciante has supplied a girningly memorable melody - 'Live for the One I love' - for <strong> Notre Dame de Paris</strong> . Apart from that, there are only two glimmers of hope in this assault on the ears and on Victor Hugo. First, when Esmeralda advances towards a huge bed: for a second you expect 'The Song of the Hump'. Second, when villainous Frollo ('I'm a priest,' he sings) is pursued by two untethered pillars which, gliding pointlessly around the stage, approach him in a pincer movement. </p> <p>Luc Plamondon's story is impossibly jumbled; his words (English versions by Will Jennings) are mostly indistinct. A madly vigorous choreography - with characters abseiling up walls, somersaulting onto mattresses, cavorting in swimming trunks - adds to the air of desperation.

Henley has made four solo albums and his 1984 song 'The Boys Of Summer', a cornerstone of rock radio, was one of the finest US singles in an otherwise forgettable musical decade.

Henley, in jeans and a loose workshirt, sits on a small sofa, pouring a Diet Coke as he waits. Starchy-faced, his only motion comes from his tongue, darting over his teeth, pushing his top lip outwards. He looks like an old man playing with his dentures. 'I was trying to make fun of the original,' says Henley crisply, still probing his teeth, when I mention 'Life In The Fast Lane'. 'At least it didn't sound like most of what makes the charts these days. Rock'n'roll doesn't mean anything,' he grumbles. 'I didn't even like grunge - all that unfocused anger was just a waste. Rap music doesn't make any sense. The Nation of Islam? What kind of a message is that? And all these pop groups are just clever marketing. Money! That's the bottom line in America these days.' He pauses, exhausted from his rant. 'I guess that's what I was trying to say yesterday.' </p> <p>The anti-corporate ideology has been a constant feature of his songwriting, paradoxically, given The Eagles' money-making power. Later he will vilify his record company. 'They're all bean counters,' he snaps. 'They call my music product: it's art. They call me a rock star when I'd rather be described as a musician. Or better, a recording artist.' He continues: 'It's a symptom of the disease in this country - the commercialisation of everything.

With his clipped speech, he makes for polite, but rather humourless company. He still believes - despite the platinum discs for the Eagles and Grammy awards for his solo albums, even despite a track from his new CD being used to play out next week's episode of ER on Channel 4 - that he is still not given the respect he is due. 'I was never allowed to make all the final decisions in The Eagles,' he admits. 'We had strong personalities in that group - all driven by various ambitions.' </p> <p>Henley makes his way towards a TV crew making a a documentary for a US network's British subsidiary.

On the face of it, the Expo should be staring at catastrophe on an even more gigantic scale than the Dome. </p> <p>At \u00a31 billion, it has cost considerably more than the Dome, and by predicting visits by 40 million people in six months, it has a target that the Millennium Commission never dreamed of, even in its most optimistic moments. And yet Hanover might just work, not because it is doing anything new, but because it is sticking to the traditional formula of the Expo: acres of brilliantly crafted junk, with the occasional flash of genius. </p> <p>We remember successful Expos for the innovation of their architecture and engineering. Crystal Palace was filled with replicas of the Venus de Milo carved in butter. And the same 1889 Paris Expo that built the Eiffel Tower also boasted a replica of the Bastille, stormed every hour on the hour by a troupe of actors got up as sans-culottes . </p> <p>The Dome is neither one thing nor another, not bad enough, but not good enough either.

      "bodyText": "Expo 2000 Hanover Hanover's Expo, which opens this week, is what the Dome would have been if the Millennium Commission hadn't insisted on pouring hundreds of millions into the toxic waste dumps of Greenwich, and had opted instead for Birmingham's bid to celebrate 2000 at the National Exhibition Centre. It is a makeover of a collection of glum concrete sheds in the middle of nowhere - normally used to show off machine tools and construction equipment - plus a job lot of specially constructed new pavilions of variable quality, rather than a brand new project. On the face of it, the Expo should be staring at catastrophe on an even more gigantic scale than the Dome. At \u00a31 billion, it has cost considerably more than the Dome, and by predicting visits by 40 million people in six months, it has a target that the Millennium Commission never dreamed of, even in its most optimistic moments. And yet Hanover might just work, not because it is doing anything new, but because it is sticking to the traditional formula of the Expo: acres of brilliantly crafted junk, with the occasional flash of genius. We remember successful Expos for the innovation of their architecture and engineering. Crystal Palace was filled with replicas of the Venus de Milo carved in butter. And the same 1889 Paris Expo that built the Eiffel Tower also boasted a replica of the Bastille, stormed every hour on the hour by a troupe of actors got up as sans-culottes . The Dome is neither one thing nor another, not bad enough, but not good enough either. It's too polite to follow in the full-blooded tradition of the great Expos, and its exhibits are too bland to have the redeeming architectural brilliance of the Crystal Palace.

I have seen that.' To reduce one of the greatest works in the repertoire, a comedy of manners of the highest intricacy and elegance, to a mere pin might be said to be missing the point. Yet one sympathises. In the fourth act, without warning, the lost pin in question suddenly becomes the focus of the opera. It heralds a long and confused unravelling of mixed identities, leading eventually to happy reconciliation (that bit, at least, is clear). Even long-standing devotees of the work take a certain pride in having not the faintest idea of what's going on in the last act of their favourite opera. </p> <p>Graham Vick, in his new production for Glyndebourne, didn't entirely shed light on the matter. Since few, if any, directors have, it may be wiser to concentrate instead on the many strengths of the illuminating first three acts. Never have the ironies or undertones been laid so bare. With his designer Richard Hudson, Vick has continued the visual theme and aesthetic spirit of his Cosi fan Tutte of two years ago. (His third Mozart/da Ponte opera, Don Giovanni, follows later in the season.) Here the empty rehearsal room has become a magic theatre in which ever-changing screens and gauzes both clarify and cloud the action. Characters begin in shirts and jeans, scene by scene donning wigs and frock coats until the transition from life to art is complete. This neatly reverses the political action of the opera since all are now equal (physically) at the start rather than merely edging towards parity at the end. </p> <p>Beautifully lit by Jennifer Tipton, the designs use every shade of ivory from creamy satin to humdrum calico to buff cardboard, these quiet contrasts matching the text's subtleties to perfection. By creating a false 'off-stage', all is visible in the act two farce of entrances and exits. For once we can see Cherubino hiding nervously in the closet, Susanna eavesdropping, the Count arriving at his wife's chamber. The effect, unexpectedly, is to darken the comedy and heighten the tension, exactly as the score's insistent string line and short, repeated motifs demands. </p> <p>Peter Mattei, a virile and savvy Figaro, dominated a sympathetic but not wholly well-matched cast. Christiane Oelze's Susanna, though charming, was often too quiet and Maria Costanza Nocentini as the Countess lacked strong vocal or dramatic impact. But Marina Comparato's Cherubino was engaging, and Mariusz Kwiecien had admirable vocal flexibility as the stiff, buttoned-up, bullying Count. In the troublesome garden scene, the screens are moved aside and the characters move around the empty stage as if playing blind-man's buff. If Vick can adjust this final act, Glyndebourne will have a handsome, perceptive Figaro on its hands. As it is, three quarters of it is riveting. The London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Andrew Davis, provided loving and refined support, never forcing the tone or tempo. </p> <p>How much can a player reasonably demand of the audience he is there (and paid) to entertain? Anyone would draw a line at, say, firing water pistols at the stage or heckling. Earlier this month in Germany, Anne-Sofie Mutter walked off stage mid-piece, with her conductor Kurt Masur, because the audience was fidgeting too much. The modern work was difficult and not quite what they were expecting. When the performers returned, everyone sat in silence, no doubt terrified, and the work was completed. Last Sunday afternoon, a keen audience packed the Festival Hall for a recital by <b> Andras Schiff</b> . To hear Schiff play Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier (Book II), which he distils to a bare, brilliant essence, is always an event. </p> <p>The hall was conspicuous for the presence of several distinguished musicians and attentive students, many following scores. No one in search of light entertainment would willingly give up their afternoon to hear one chap commune with Bach for two and a half hours. Yet 10 minutes into his performance, while playing the long left-hand opening statement of a fugue, he waved his free arm angrily at the audience unmistakably telling us, by his gesture, to 'Shut up'. The problem was that a few members of this committed bunch were a touch bronchial, still adjusting to the switch from damp, cold outside to dry, warm hall. One thing about the Festival Hall is that it's good for coughs. From a sniff to a snort to a full-blown chesty convulsion, the acoustic tosses each round the auditorium like renaissance polyphony around a cathedral. </p> <p>Everyone, well-drilled in concert etiquette, struggled to keep their explosions to the natural pause between one pair of preludes and fugues and the start of the next. But Schiff didn't want any natural pauses and held his hands over the keyboard to show the inherent link between each piece. After the interval, a lady was sent on stage to explain his sense of the work 'as an uninterrupted arc', by which time, like naughty children in school assembly, we had certainly got the point ('Would he rather we just died quietly?' muttered a peeved American).

      "body": "<p><strong> Kingdom of the Soul: Symbolist Art in Germany 1870-1920</strong> </p> <p>Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, until 30 July </p> <p>No artist has ever suffered a plunge in reputation quite so sudden or so steep as the Swiss-born symbolist Arnold B\u00f6cklin, the leading painter of his adoptive Germany in the late-nineteenth century. He was as famous as those who acclaimed him - Nietzsche, Brahms, Schopenhauer and Munch, who called him 'the sacred flame' of German art. Every self-respecting burgher owned a copy of his masterwork, Island of Death, in which a white-robed priest ferries a corpse over Stygian waters to a mausoleum raked by moonlight. In its day, the picture was as familiar as the opening chords of Beethoven's Fifth; it was the Mona Lisa of German painting. </p> <p>When B\u00f6cklin died in 1901, Richard Strauss wrote the funeral hymn and the world's press rushed to eulogise 'the founder of a new yearned-for art'. One year later, however, the artist was disparaged as a pedlar of kitsch; two years later he was vilified in a book, The B\u00f6cklin Case, as the witting stooge of a chauvinist state. It didn't help that his main champions were nationalists. The sacred flame waned fast. Apart from a stint in the Thirties, B\u00f6cklin's work was rarely seen in European museums until his rehabilitation in the late Seventies. </p> <p>So what did for B\u00f6cklin? The Nazis, of course, who commandeered B\u00f6cklin and many of his peers for the F\u00fchrer's pantheon of approved artists. But even before this posthumous patronage contaminated his career, there was another force which effectively deleted German symbolism from the history of art. This was the overwhelming tendency of the world's museums, even before impressionism set the seal, to favour French over German painting. A symbolist, according to this bias, was a nervy Parisian dreamer; not some coarse provincial labouring in a Bavarian forest. </p> <p><strong> Kingdom of the Soul</strong> is the first show of German symbolism ever to be staged in Britain - or indeed Germany, where its European tour began. Given the circumstances, it could hardly fail to surprise: from B\u00f6cklin's alarming melodramas to Klinger's phantasmagoria and Zwintscher's eerie nightscapes, there are almost 200 works by 60 artists, most of them unknown in this country. Seen together, they amount to a visual opera performed at full-volume blast. </p> <p>Symbolism, a vague term in itself, is all about the gradual evocation of mood as opposed to the clear description of fact. In France, this produced an effete iconography of wilting flowers, floating wraiths, unicorns and the jewel-dripping fantasies of Gustav Moreau. In Germany, it meant everything from golden lads and lasses enjoying a Bavarian Eden to ravens, monsters and haunted chapels, Olympian gods, fallen mortals and shattering visions of the afterlife. Above all - and you see this throughout the show - it meant lonely figures silhouetted on a shore, looking out to sea, yearning for some unattainable land beyond. </p> <p>The unattainable can often be identified with some precision as Italy, Goethe's 'land where the lemon flowers'. More than half of these artists went to Italy and came back infatuated with classical culture. A typical symbolist landscape, as painted by Ferdinand Knab, shows a Roman temple against a heavy northern sky scattered with cawing harbingers. A typical symbolist myth, as painted by Anselm Feuerbach, shows Diana bathing - or it would, if you could make her out in the inky gloom of Feuerbach's Black Forest. </p> <p>In short, the landscape of German symbolism is profoundly Teutonic. The warm South, with its oranges and lemons, becomes the romantic North. Even Hans Thoma's Eden, a paradise of date-palms and parrots, is stricken with a cataract straight out of Caspar David Friedrich. In this context, it's horribly easy to see how symbolism's classical athletes could look to later eyes like Hitler Youth practising eurythmics for the Fatherland. </p> <p>Yet the mood evoked by this art - with some appalling exceptions of Aryan kitsch - is anything but triumphalist. B\u00f6cklin's shark-finned Tritan, copulating with a red-eyed Nereid in a dark convulsive sea, still seems frightening. Max Klinger's etchings of the afterlife - as a black canyon into which we are hurled by death - send shivers of foreboding across the mind. </p> <p>Klinger, who is very much the star of this show, painted a Crucifixion in which the figure of Christ is entirely, distressingly naked. It caused a sensation in 1870 and it still seems properly shocking today. But it turns out to be consistent with so much of this art, which never shies from full-on male nudity, female eroticism and all-out release of the irrational, emotional psyche. </p> <p>German symbolism is routinely diagnosed as a reaction to Bismarck's modernised, materialist state. But that doesn't begin to explain the astonishing variety of this show, which runs all the way from Klinger's magnificent bust of the glowering Nietzsche to Richard Muller's jackbooted skeletons and Franz Von Stuck's soft-porn tat.

      "bodyText": "Kingdom of the Soul: Symbolist Art in Germany 1870-1920 Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, until 30 July No artist has ever suffered a plunge in reputation quite so sudden or so steep as the Swiss-born symbolist Arnold B\u00f6cklin, the leading painter of his adoptive Germany in the late-nineteenth century. He was as famous as those who acclaimed him - Nietzsche, Brahms, Schopenhauer and Munch, who called him 'the sacred flame' of German art. Every self-respecting burgher owned a copy of his masterwork, Island of Death, in which a white-robed priest ferries a corpse over Stygian waters to a mausoleum raked by moonlight. In its day, the picture was as familiar as the opening chords of Beethoven's Fifth; it was the Mona Lisa of German painting. When B\u00f6cklin died in 1901, Richard Strauss wrote the funeral hymn and the world's press rushed to eulogise 'the founder of a new yearned-for art'. One year later, however, the artist was disparaged as a pedlar of kitsch; two years later he was vilified in a book, The B\u00f6cklin Case, as the witting stooge of a chauvinist state. It didn't help that his main champions were nationalists. The sacred flame waned fast. Apart from a stint in the Thirties, B\u00f6cklin's work was rarely seen in European museums until his rehabilitation in the late Seventies. So what did for B\u00f6cklin? The Nazis, of course, who commandeered B\u00f6cklin and many of his peers for the F\u00fchrer's pantheon of approved artists. But even before this posthumous patronage contaminated his career, there was another force which effectively deleted German symbolism from the history of art. This was the overwhelming tendency of the world's museums, even before impressionism set the seal, to favour French over German painting. A symbolist, according to this bias, was a nervy Parisian dreamer; not some coarse provincial labouring in a Bavarian forest. Kingdom of the Soul is the first show of German symbolism ever to be staged in Britain - or indeed Germany, where its European tour began. Given the circumstances, it could hardly fail to surprise: from B\u00f6cklin's alarming melodramas to Klinger's phantasmagoria and Zwintscher's eerie nightscapes, there are almost 200 works by 60 artists, most of them unknown in this country. Seen together, they amount to a visual opera performed at full-volume blast. Symbolism, a vague term in itself, is all about the gradual evocation of mood as opposed to the clear description of fact. In France, this produced an effete iconography of wilting flowers, floating wraiths, unicorns and the jewel-dripping fantasies of Gustav Moreau. In Germany, it meant everything from golden lads and lasses enjoying a Bavarian Eden to ravens, monsters and haunted chapels, Olympian gods, fallen mortals and shattering visions of the afterlife. Above all - and you see this throughout the show - it meant lonely figures silhouetted on a shore, looking out to sea, yearning for some unattainable land beyond. The unattainable can often be identified with some precision as Italy, Goethe's 'land where the lemon flowers'. More than half of these artists went to Italy and came back infatuated with classical culture. A typical symbolist landscape, as painted by Ferdinand Knab, shows a Roman temple against a heavy northern sky scattered with cawing harbingers. A typical symbolist myth, as painted by Anselm Feuerbach, shows Diana bathing - or it would, if you could make her out in the inky gloom of Feuerbach's Black Forest. In short, the landscape of German symbolism is profoundly Teutonic. The warm South, with its oranges and lemons, becomes the romantic North. Even Hans Thoma's Eden, a paradise of date-palms and parrots, is stricken with a cataract straight out of Caspar David Friedrich. In this context, it's horribly easy to see how symbolism's classical athletes could look to later eyes like Hitler Youth practising eurythmics for the Fatherland. Yet the mood evoked by this art - with some appalling exceptions of Aryan kitsch - is anything but triumphalist. B\u00f6cklin's shark-finned Tritan, copulating with a red-eyed Nereid in a dark convulsive sea, still seems frightening. Max Klinger's etchings of the afterlife - as a black canyon into which we are hurled by death - send shivers of foreboding across the mind. Klinger, who is very much the star of this show, painted a Crucifixion in which the figure of Christ is entirely, distressingly naked. It caused a sensation in 1870 and it still seems properly shocking today. But it turns out to be consistent with so much of this art, which never shies from full-on male nudity, female eroticism and all-out release of the irrational, emotional psyche. German symbolism is routinely diagnosed as a reaction to Bismarck's modernised, materialist state. But that doesn't begin to explain the astonishing variety of this show, which runs all the way from Klinger's magnificent bust of the glowering Nietzsche to Richard Muller's jackbooted skeletons and Franz Von Stuck's soft-porn tat. This variety even devolves to the micro-level of a single career. Von Stuck, for example, can surprise you with a single, incisive etching. B\u00f6cklin veers from the late romanticism of his Self-Portrait with Death to the Hammer-horror schlock of his ruined chapel. It may be that there is no clear definition of symbolist art, nothing to connect the flimsy fantasies of Moreau with the durable power of Klinger's etchings. But B\u00f6cklin seems to have identified some of the characteristics of German symbolism, wittingly or not, when he said that art should tell a story, as much as literature, and that it should aim for the resonance of music. Island of Death inspired Rachmaninov, Strindberg, Dali and Hesse. De Chirico acknowledged a lifelong debt to B\u00f6cklin. Look at Zwintscher's painted paradoxes and you see the makings of Magritte; look at Liepold's Gateway to the Cosmos and you see the graphic art of the Seventies prefigured.

While he's about it, Luca also seduces Angelo, the uptight Don Jose figure whose life is about to fall apart. </p> <p>So far, so good. By the end of Act I, the screw has tightened nicely in this well-assembled set of boxes within boxes. Bourne is playing with several conventions: Hollywood film noir, Italian low-life realism, melodramatic opera and stylised dance.

There are going to be at least three casts on tour, with some of the principals alternating roles. Burly, Brando-ish Ewan Wardrop, whom I saw as the dark angel, Luca, will also be fragile, febrile Angelo; Will Kemp will toughen himself from wimp to seducer. The women's roles, at present, are underwritten, though Michela Meazza as Lana flaunted her sexuality with a vengeance. </p> <p>Bourne's choreography moves from naturalism to elaborate routines. The corps of floozies and grease monkeys can be as stylised as Roland Petit's tarts and toreadors in his 1949 Carmen . Then at times they mirror the coupling of the principals, as though the whole town was in rut. The pas de deux for the central characters, however, are the weakest element in the show. Brief, underdeveloped, they convey only one overriding emotion - lust, anguish or animosity. </p> <p>The realisation of how much is missing from these encounters comes when they cross into ballet territory: Angelo and his girlfriend appalled and mesmerised by a gun, for example, in echoes of a Mayerling pas de deux. Bourne cannot find imagery beyond the literal, so the grappling becomes banal. Angelo is seriously deranged in the second half of show, which starts to go to pieces even before he does. Too many screws have been driven into too many planks for the structure to hold steady. Yet more film genres are added to the mix: schlock horror, penitentiary drama, revenge thriller. A cabaret opens Act II, with a Martha Graham parody, a modern dance play within a play. The reference is one to earlier AMP numbers.

Words tumble out of Sir John, whereas Sir Ralph measures them carefully, as if squeezing out every syllable.</p> <p><b> SIR JOHN:</b> Come on the motorbike?</p> <p><b> SIR RALPH: </b> Best...way.</p> <p><b> JG:</b> The last time you took me pillion I practically had a fit. I was a stretcher case.</p> <p><b> RR: </b> I have been killed several times myself.</p> <p><b> JG:</b> Shall we have oysters?</p> <p><b> RR:</b> Good idea! And to follow? Fish and game go rather nicely together.</p> <p><b> JG:</b> I shall have roast grouse because I love it. I love roast grouse more than anything.</p> <p><b> RR:</b> Roast grouse is awfully good.</p> <p><b> JG:</b> I remember being taken to the Naval and Military Club as a very young man and being given oysters and grouse for the first time. I thought I really was living it up.</p> <p><b> RR: </b> Shall we live it up now?</p> <p><b> JG: </b> Certainly!</p> <p><b> RR:</b> You're looking very well, by the way.</p> <p><b> JG:</b> Thank you.</p> <p><b> RR:</b> I haven't seen much of you lately.</p> <p><b> JG:</b> We meet in costume.</p> <p><b> RR:</b> We meet as other people.</p> <p><i> A waiter hovers. </i></p> <p><b> RR: </b> We're having oysters followed by grouse.</p> <p><b> JG:</b> You are, too?

I would like to have more, but dare not.</p> <p><b> JG: </b> We're all much more abstemious with drink than we used to be.</p> <p><b> RR: </b> I'm less abstemious. When I was young, I never drank during the run of a show, except on Saturday nights.</p> <p><b> JG: </b> Oh, I used to drink away like anything. On the first night of Much Ado , Peggy Ashcroft and I drank a bottle of champagne before going on and we never played so well in our lives.</p> <p><b> RR:</b> It would have terrified me. The spring wouldn't be there. Lowers the energy.</p> <p><b> JG:</b> But just think of all those brilliant people who couldn't function without a drink. I'm sure Barrymore couldn't have done it.</p> <p><b> RR:</b> Kean was the greatest drinker of them all, of course. Hot brandy. When he was playing Othello, he invented a false exit for himself so he could nip off for a brandy and come on again, fortified as it were.</p> <p><b> JG:</b> Do you think opera singers have a drop or two between their arias?</p> <p><i> A waiter serves oysters.

I was walking down St Martin's Lane when a man suddenly shouted: 'Look! It's Sir John Gielgud!'</p> <p><b> JG:</b> But in America they always call me Sir Ralph Richardson. Perhaps it's because we've acted together over the years. We're almost like the broker's men in Cinderella .</p> <p><b> RR:</b> But would you say we look alike, Johnny? I was in France some time ago. Very peculiar. It was dark and my wife had gone down a little alley. I said: 'Mu, it's this way.' And a Frenchman appeared in the half light and cried: 'Mon Dieu! It's John Gielgud!'</p> <p><b> JG: </b> I've been stopped twice in London for Kenneth Clark.</p> <p><b> RR:</b> I should be most flattered to be mistaken for him.</p> <p><i>They finish the oysters.

What did he want?</p> <p><b> JG: </b> He spoke terribly good English for a Russian. He said he was so glad he'd seen the performance because he felt he understood Harold Pinter at last. He said that No Man's Land is just a wonderful black comedy. It was such a relief to me. People get rather desperate about what the play means. I'm not sure I know either. Yet here was the Russian who accepted it simply as a black comedy instead of searching for endless symbolism and implications of every kind. I mean, I'm sure Harold's plays always have implications, but I don't think his intention is for the audience to spend the entire evening trying to solve them. I'm sure he's quite pleased if people go away and discuss the possibilities.</p> <p><b> RR </b> : Did you see that man walk out of the performance last night?</p> <p><b> JG </b> : The only time it's happened.</p> <p><b> RR </b> : Perhaps he was offended by the language.</p> <p><b> JG </b> : Yet it's very interesting how the elderly public remains so calm at all the expletives flowing from us on stage.</p> <p><b> RR </b> : Common parlance.</p> <p><b> JG </b> : I remember saying to my mother when I was a boy: 'Couldn't we go and see Uncle Fred in the Scarlet Pimp ?'

What does the word mean?</p> <p><b> JG </b> : What does it mean? Special, I think.</p> <p><b> RR </b> : Sounds Greek to me. Greekish sounding word..</p> <p><b> JG </b> : I suppose it must be Greek. But the only man I've known who had the same quality as Brook was Komisarjevsky. He was an architect, a designer, a painter, a director. Enormous talent and knowledge. I think Lindsay Anderson is so brilliant, but he hasn't got the charisma of Brook. Peter's a sort of world figure. I often long for Lindsay to have the same appeal and success. I think he would do marvellous work if he had a little more appreciation.</p> <p><b> RR </b> : What was that terrible production Brook did? Of course, he's done such amazing stuff. Parts of A Midsummer Night's Dream were among the most brilliant theatre of our time. But that ghastly thing. You were in it.</p> <p><b> JG </b> : Oedipus ?</p> <p><b> RR </b> : That's it! Awful.</p> <p><b> JG </b> : Oh, I thought it was extraordinary. I'll never regret doing it. I wasn't very good in it. I didn't know how to do what he wanted. But you know, there were terrible rows between Brook and Olivier. When Olivier saw this great phallus on the stage of the Old Vic he thought the theatre would be closed down by the police. Brook wouldn't give in, though. They were arguing in the dressing room. So I left them to fight it out between them. When I came back a huge mirror had a crack right through it. It was like the Lady of Shalott. I long to know which one of them did it.</p> <p><b> RR </b> : When I went to see the production, somehow I hadn't got a programme. So I said to Mu: 'Leave it to me.' And I went down the aisle up to a chap, but he was lashed to a pillar. I didn't know what was going on. It turned out he was in the show. I think he was in the chorus. But the show hadn't started yet. Mu said: 'Did you get a programme?' And I had to say it wasn't possible because all the programme sellers were lashed to the dress circle. Very strange.</p> <p><b> JG </b> : Oh, dear! It's like the old lady who went to Wesker's Roots and they cooked a meal on stage during the first act. Onions and a frightful stew. The lady went up to a programme seller and said: 'Isn't there a rather curious smell in this theatre?' And the programme seller replied: 'It's the play, madam.' But what did the poor actor who was lashed to the pillar say to you?</p> <p><b> RR </b> : Well, of course, when I asked him for a programme all I got were these strangled sounds. He was gagged you see. The whole experience upset me very much. I'm a very square man.</p> <p><b> JG </b> : Yes, you are. But you're also very clever, Ralph. You can be very suspicious, but once you overcome it you're enormously interested and warm. Unlike me, you're cautious. Which is quite right.</p> <p><b> RR </b> : Very, very cautious.</p> <p><i> Enter Miss Jane Bown, the photographer from The Observer.

I couldn't get over Garbo being 70 the other day. Did you see that photo of her? It really shocked me. Photography is rather a terrifying medium. Look at Richard Avedon's pictures. Merciless! He photographed me once and asked me to cry for him. So I thought of everyone I loved and the tears flowed like mad. But he never published the picture anywhere. Two hours of crying for nothing. I was very cross.</p> <p><b> RR </b> : The trouble is I can never remember who I am whenever I'm photographed. Who am I? I find I'm no one in particular and it tends to emerge in the photos. Is the light all right, Miss Bown?</p> <p><b> JG </b> : It's strange. I never feel secure whenever I'm photographed in costume at dress rehearsals.

But five minutes later the door burst open and an enormous Indian lady in a green sari looked at me trying desperately to cover myself with a tiny towel and announced: 'My name is Mrs Sabawala.

      "bodyText": "Sir John Gielgud and Sir Ralph Richardson, starring in Harold Pinter's No Man's Land, meet for lunch in a West End restaurant at the request of a newspaper. The setting is discreet and grand. There, the two actors are to be specially photographed for The Observer . Outside the restaurant, the roar of a motorbike is heard. Enter SIR RALPH RICHARDSON. He is dressed in a smart brown suit and an enormous cyclist's helmet, like a visor. He offers the helmet to the head waiter with the aplomb of an English gentleman handing over his bowler hat. Then he sits at a corner table and orders a vodka martini. Enter SIR JOHN GIELGUD. He is tall and elegant, pink and sunny, immaculately dressed. An acquaintance spots him and greets him warmly: 'Wish you were lunching with us, Johnny!' The two actors meet and sit together. Both are very relaxed in each other's company, and fun. Words tumble out of Sir John, whereas Sir Ralph measures them carefully, as if squeezing out every syllable. SIR JOHN: Come on the motorbike? SIR RALPH: Best...way.

My house is music in stone. Will you come to lunch tomorrow?' It turned out she had played Madame Arcati in Blithe Spirit with the local amateurs. Her house had a huge gate with a cardboard crescent moon pinned to it. Nothing to drink. RR : Nothing to drink! JG : And terrible chairs. As you sat down your back was lacerated by the teak. You had to practically go down on your hands and knees to look out of the windows. The whole thing was absolutely mad! There was a tiny poet in a white suit who read a long poem he'd written in my honour. It once happened with Alan Ginsberg in New York too. I seem to inspire poetry in strange people. But I was so startled by the Indian poet that I stepped back in alarm and fell in a pool covered in lilies. RR : My God, what you suffer! Not that you care, Johnny. JG : Couldn't have happened in England, Ralph. The two famous actors laugh and finish their lunch.

      "body": "<p>The mother, the father, and the Baby Blair. They make a perfect picture, don't they? As icons, they stand for everything a family ought to be. But how close can the rest of us hope to get to this ideal?</p> <p>Look beyond the picture frame, look at any tabloid any day of the week, and the picture of British family life looks like something out of Hades. As a nation we have become obsessed with fears about damaged children and endangered childhood.</p> <p>These stories come and go very fast. We are up in arms about them one day, and then, a few days later, not thinking about them at all. So it is hard to see what effect they have on our thinking in the long term. But if you put all the stories of the past 10 years back to back, you see our traditional understanding of parenthood being eroded almost daily by the dreadful tales of deranged baby snatchers and killer babysitters, mothers who leave their children home alone and go off for a fortnight in Benidorm, and mothers who stay at home while their boyfriends beat their children to death.</p> <p>Everywhere we look we see paedophiles. Some run children's homes, others run scout clubs, or masquerade as teachers, priests, doctors, nursery aids, and counsellors. Many are stepfathers. Biological fathers have a record that is only slightly cleaner, and, while most mothers continue to be above suspicion, the scandals featuring abusive and murderous ones are slowly undermining our complacency.</p> <p>Faced with this endless procession of disgraced, failed, and criminal parents, it is easy to forget that the vast majority of parents do not murder their children. It is hard even to think about procreation as a basic human right. In fact, it is a human right (enshrined in British law since 1998). But every time we read of a child who has been hurt or abandoned, abused or killed, we cannot help but ask, how did we let this happen? Why were these parents entrusted with this fragile, innocent life? The idea that parents need to be improved morally, and held to strict public standards, is one that is gaining support right across the political spectrum. Thus, we have think-tanks publishing report after report on the endangered family, the inadequate parent, and the lawless child. We have the Government attributing an ever-expanding range of social ills on parental neglect, abuse, or 'lack of preparedness'. There is wide debate about the damage done to children by parents who divorce, by parents who spend too little time at home because they work too hard, and by parents who ought to have realised they were too poor, or immature, and irresponsible to give their children that all-important good start. There is a growing consensus that something must be done to tell these parents what their responsibilities are.</p> <p>If I am objecting to this consensus, am I saying that parents should be allowed to do whatever they want, no matter what effect this has on their children? That they need not take responsibility for their mistakes? No, of course I'm not. I think it is essential for parents to take responsibility for their children, and for the way they bring them up. There may be a limit to what individual parents can do for their children, but (in my view) all parents owe it to their children to work with what they have. Even when their lives are constrained and their choices severely limited, they still have a great deal of power over their children, and their children depend on them to use that power wisely.</p> <p>My problem with the 'new morality' I have seen developing, scandal by scandal, over the past two decades, is its ambivalence about parents having any power at all. Traditional morality divided parents along gender lines, giving ultimate authority to the male head of household. The new morality sets out to be gender-blind, but it still divides parents into two groups, and only sees one group as capable of exercising parental power and authority. It would like to demote the other, less 'responsible' parents to the status of children, or should I say, to the status formerly accorded to women before we got the vote.</p> <p>However, treating parents like children does not make them into better parents. No mother can hope to care for her children in a humane way if she is perfectly content to let others set the rules by which they live.</p> <p>For example, I cannot claim to be doing the best for my children if the first thing I do is defer in all matters to a higher authority. I am not going to be able to do much for them if I agree to stay at home and cultivate my own parent trap. My children don't just need me at home: they need me to defend their interests outside it. Not just their present interests, but their future interests. And not just their personal interests, but the interests of their generation. But I can't do that unless I have the right to do so. If I say parents need to have rights, the first response is often a shudder, followed by a reminder about the legions of parents who don't deserve them.</p> <p>But imagine if you applied that argument to other areas of life. Imagine if you said that adults couldn't use banks any more, because some of them were embezzlers. Imagine if you banned all drivers, because some drove when over the limit and ignored traffic lights. No one draws up a bill of rights using as their model a bank robber or a drunk driver. The model is always an ideal type, and the degree to which a human being can enjoy those rights depends on how hard he or she tries to live by the ideal. You can take rights away from people who act criminally or irresponsibly, but unless you give them rights, they cannot act at all. Michael Freeman, the children's rights advocate, says that possessing rights 'is necessary to constitute personality. Those who lack rights are like slaves, means to another's ends, and never their own sovereigns'. While it's true that adults do have rights as individuals, their rights as representatives of their families or their children are being fast eroded. This has happened as a direct consequence of the many media-led panics about parenting, which have given rise to a growing consensus that parents have children for suspect reasons, and use them as extensions of their egos or for their private pleasure. And while many people believe that curtailing parents' rights is wise, and state intervention in families necessary to keep parents from using their power over their children badly, it also means that parents have less and less power to change their children's lives for the better.</p> <p>Nowhere is this more apparent than in 'Supporting Families', the consultation document in which the Government sets out its radical new framework for family policy. Many of the measures in this document - such as parenting orders - are coming into place right now. As government documents go, it could not be more family-friendly. In addition to an ambitious national childcare strategy and financial aid for families in greatest need, it also proposes a new sort of partnership between parents and the state. The Government offers to become almost the third parent of every British child, a sort of Holy Ghost of family life, offering help, advice, and guidance from cradle to grave.</p> <p>But look closer. The language in this document is rather worrying. Children are measured and judged primarily by their behaviour and performance. When the word happiness' appears, it is paired with the word 'success'. When the word 'loving' appears, it is to modify the word 'firmness'. Bringing up children is not a joy or a revelation, but a service. Children are not little people with their own personalities that transform the way you look at the world. They feature instead as challenging and problematic objects that must be monitored, corralled, tamed and improved. While this may be an accurate description of some aspects of child-rearing, as an overview it is narrow and blinkered and does not come close to describing what it means to me, or, I suspect, to anyone who has ever looked after children, Tony and Cherie included.</p> <p>The document's use of the blanket term 'parent' is similarly worrying. At first it looks nice, modern, inclusive. But replace the word 'parent' with 'line manager', and you quickly see that it treats parents as if they were public employees. Go back to those same statements and replace the word 'parent' with 'woman' and you pick up on the paternalistic tone. You begin to understand how business is being done. It's: 'We've thought this out very carefully, darling, and I know it sounds awfully complicated, but honestly, it's for your own good.' As opposed to: 'We need to think this over and here are my ideas. As a parent of 21 years' standing, what do you have to add?'</p> <p>Well, Jack Straw, here's what I have to add. I can't claim to be the sort of parent you might want as a role model. I'm divorced. I am not always good at loving firmness. My study is a tip, as is my bedroom. According to my partner, the towels in the dryer are still damp. Last night, I made myself a Lemsip and then forgot to put the mug in the sink. Once, about 10 or 11 years ago, I forgot all about supper and when my children began to complain at 11 in the evening, I found out that all I had to give them was ice cream.</p> <p>In spite of all this, I really do try very hard, at least most of the time, to be a good example to my children, and think very hard about how I bring them up. I've agonised as any parent about whether or not I have brought them up to have the right kind of manners, and the right set of values and the right attitude to work, life and other people. I entertain the usual vain hope that they will all turn into thoughtful, talented, happy, dependable, neat adults. I indulge in as many impossible fantasies as any parent about the amazing things they might do for mankind one day, thus proving to the world that I was a much better parent than they ever imagined.</p> <p>But there is one ambition I am pretty sure I never had. I don't think I ever sat down with their fathers and said: 'Here's an idea. Let's spend the next 20 years or so raising children according to government standards. Let's become a building block of society, and turn out a host of responsible citizens. Let's make sure they grow up knowing that really good citizens should always do what the state tells them to do, and never question it.'</p> <p>No two of my children have ever held a cup in the same way, or had the same way of walking, or had the same voice, or the same way of singing, thinking, laughing, or seeing the world. Bringing them up has mostly meant watching them become themselves. It's a terrible mistake to think that parents are the wise ones, and children their blank slates. If I had to say what I've treasured most about the times I've had with all four of my children, it's been the things they surprised me with, the things they did or said or thought up or discovered by themselves. When my eldest daughter woke up early one morning when she was five (or it was six), took my cheque book out of my handbag and wrote me a cheque for a million pounds. When she wrapped up all my jewellery in the pages of a typescript I was printing out and gave it back to me. When my two little daughters decorated my bedroom with 200 plastic animals, and positioned them in such a way that they were all facing the television set. When they learnt to count to 10 in Turkish. When they tried and failed to teach me sign language. When I took them to a village in Spain, and they kept themselves amused by counting the things they saw and couldn't understand. I've learnt as much about life from watching my children grow as they've ever learnt from watching me.</p> <p>It would be too much to expect any government to see children the way parents do, just as it would be too much to hope that, when children and young people don't behave in a way that is convenient for them, governments will not immediately see this behaviour as anti-social.</p> <p>The problems begin when there is no one out there to challenge this view of things, or to suggest that it is not the only valid interpretation of events. The worst thing about the current media panic surrounding parents and parenthood, is that it makes state intervention seem necessary. We're failing our children, and our families are disintegrating, so someone must step in and restore the moral order. What's broken must be fixed.</p> <p>But there always have been parents who fail their children, and there always will be. So long as most parents operate in conditions as appalling as some of those that exist today, we can be pretty sure there will continue to be many, many parents who fail their children. Efforts to police and lecture them, shame and name them, may make those parents feel bad, and the rest of us feel superior, but they won't solve the problems that pushed them over the edge.</p> <p>This is not to say that turning parents into scapegoats is something of which only the authorities are guilty. It has become ingrained in our culture, something we all seem to take great pleasure in. It's a way of confirming to ourselves that actually, despite all the changes we've gone through over the past decades, most of us still have the same values, or at least a shared understand ing of what it is we've almost lost. It is a form of moral shorthand. Look at them, we say. Is this what the world is coming to? Maybe it won't be if we punish them for their sins. To imply that a parent fails because of lapsed morals, is to imply that there's an easy solution. You don't have to solve poverty, or redesign your employment policy, or try to figure out how you factor in unpaid work when planning a market economy. All you have to do is give people lessons, and then more lessons. If they still don't learn, all they deserve is a lecture and a stiff fine.</p> <p>I can see the attraction of this argument. What I can't understand is how anybody could seriously believe it. You have only to use your eyes and think for a moment to see that there is always more to it than that. This brings me to the one thing I really do hope I have taught my children: that believing in fairy-stories just because they're comforting can be a dangerous enterprise.</p> <p>I hope I've taught them that while it is sometimes inconvenient to stop and think, and ask awkward questions, it is also what makes a democracy stay democratic, a society ethical, and a conscience clear. I hope I've taught them that, for no other reason than that it was from them I rediscovered the importance of inconvenient questions - as those are the kind that children ask.</p> <p>They stubbornly insist on seeing life as a mystery to explore instead of a grim plan they must honour. They revel in the little things that adults forget to notice. They show their emotions, even to the point of being pleased when they see themselves in the mirror. They look forward to their birthdays. Even when they refuse to eat their vegetables, they grow. They ask 'why?'. These are just a few of the miracles they perform for their parents, and that is why even today, with things so grim and getting daily grimmer, parents still talk about life with children as a joy.</p> <p>I hope my children will be able to know this joy themselves when they grow up, and that then as now they will keep on stopping and looking and asking those inconvenient questions.</p> <p><b> Maureen Freely's The Parent Trap is published by Little, Brown at \u00a39.99.

I hope I've taught them that, for no other reason than that it was from them I rediscovered the importance of inconvenient questions - as those are the kind that children ask. They stubbornly insist on seeing life as a mystery to explore instead of a grim plan they must honour. They revel in the little things that adults forget to notice. They show their emotions, even to the point of being pleased when they see themselves in the mirror. They look forward to their birthdays. Even when they refuse to eat their vegetables, they grow. They ask 'why?'. These are just a few of the miracles they perform for their parents, and that is why even today, with things so grim and getting daily grimmer, parents still talk about life with children as a joy. I hope my children will be able to know this joy themselves when they grow up, and that then as now they will keep on stopping and looking and asking those inconvenient questions.

      "body": "<p>This weekend around 26 million people will be dabbling in DIY. Not so long ago, bank holidays were spent scrapping on the seafront; nowadays, we pick fights in B&amp;Q, battling over the last remaining pot of lavender Dulux. Five years ago, there were only four interiors magazines; you can currently pick from 25. You can barely switch on your television without being told how to turn your kitchen into a Moroccan souk, or your utility cupboard into a fantasy on a theme of the Palace of Versailles. And the man who is chiefly responsible for all of this is Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, camp-as-you-like star of the makeover interiors show Changing Rooms . </p> <p>It was he, for instance, who magicked up a plum-coloured Queen Anne-style dining room with a fake fireplace for the Dukes family in Hull, and looked a little bit perplexed when Mrs Dukes promptly burst into tears. Certainly, his outlandish, jackdaw tastes mean that he acts as a Plimsoll line for DIYers. The comment 'That looks a bit Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen', often heard in home-improvement emporiums, is in fact a coded command meaning: 'Put that tester pot right back where you found it or there will be hell to pay.' He himself points out that as far as the viewing public is concerned, he is 'the fifth horseman of the Apocalypse, who rapes your room and then laughs in your face'. </p> <p>I have been invited to meet Laurence at his house, The Nook, which does not disappoint. It's a classic 'Changing Rooms' project, since it is one thing on the outside (a squat Twenties bungalow with fussy stained-glass windows windows overlooking a busy south London road) and something else entirely within. Pia, his assistant, lets me into the turquoise hall, where recesses in the wall accommodate Nefertiti heads and pink-and-gold teacups, and shows me into the lilac sitting room, which is tiny - only marginally larger than a ping-pong table, so that you can pull the curtains, switch on the telly and shut the door without stirring from the sofa. Crammed with pink roses in distressed china jugs, and timber-sized candles, and biographies of Purcell and Cecil Beaton, with Satie's Gymnop\u00e9dies tinkling restfully out of the CD player, it evokes the cabin of a romantic novelist who is going on a very long Cunard voyage. There isn't really room for me on the sofa, what with all the fawn velvet cushions, but I jemmy myself in as best I can. You simply can't imagine a family of four - Laurence, 34, has a wife, Jackie, and two little daughters called Cecile and Hermione - gathering in here to play Monopoly. </p> <p>Laurence himself is in the garden shed that serves as his office, where he toils on his cutlery lines, and his wallpaper lines, and his tassel lines, as well as the telly stuff. He no longer does private commissions. ('It's an awful thing to say, but doing stuff for private clients is very bad business, when I look at how much I can charge for opening a supermarket.') When he enters - ever the camp, full-throttle dandy-highwayman in a William Hunt suit and an op-art tie-and-shirt combo that makes my eyes water - vapour trails of aftershave and cigarette smoke curl in his wake. He is making the most of Marlboro Lights, having decided to give them up last New Year's Eve. Or rather, last New Year's Eve, he decided he would give them up on June 24. 'You need a big date to work towards. Giving up on New Year's Day is pants because you've got to get through January,' he says. 'Whereas if you give up in the middle of summer, there are more distractions. I keep doing aversion therapy and thinking, \"How disgusting!\" In fact, I've got to have another cigarette now. I love smoking. I'm so good at it.' </p> <p>The decision to give up smoking is but one plank in the all-new LLB philosophy. The others are to a) move the business out of the garden shed and into proper premises and b) to move house. Without any prompting, Laurence tells me that they bought The Nook for \u00a3125,000 four years ago, and now it's under offer at \u00a3375,000. 'Some of the estate agents were saying, \"You can stack on an extra 70 grand because it's your place.\" But we decided we weren't going to be cheeky. I've made a quarter of a million on it - to ask for more than that just because I'm \"me\" sounds a bit... you know... downmarket.' He and Jackie, who married in 1989, are currently in a 'very tight biddingy-war thingy' on the next place, a house a few streets away which is a fine example of Adelaidian architecture. </p> <p>'When you get to William IV, it's not William-ian, it's Adelaidian after Queen Adelaide, because she was a great arbiter of taste.' </p> <p>The prospect of moving has allowed Laurence to show his true colours, which are not quite as bright as you'd expect. 'For four years I've been battling against a really rather ugly hunchback bungalow, so you need to paint it rather scary colours to take your eyes away from the fact that there's no architectural detail. I have quite enjoyed the democracy of that: there's nothing in this place that I haven't done for someone else on Changing Rooms. My MDF has exactly the same problems as their MDF. But this new place is so frighteningly posh that there's no question of me being democratic any more. I'm not going to contrive it. No colour boards.' </p> <p>Laurence has several sociological theories about the DIY boom. He points out that 'a big Changing Rooms archive' has been assembled at the Victoria and Albert Museum: 'The V&amp;A really feels that interior design has become a democratic preoccupation in a way that it never has been before. It's all about encouraging people to take control of their own environment. I do honestly believe there is something very important about this interiors obsession. Say on Monday morning you've got some thing really shitty to do: on Sunday night you do the weirdest things, like tidying up the linen cupboard, or sorting the cutlery drawer so all the forks are in the right place. If you take a little bit of control, it makes dealing with the big things easier.' </p> <p>Gravel crunches in the drive, and then Jackie, strapping and jolly-looking, appears in the doorway. 'I have just signed on the dotted lines for our new offices!' she announces triumphantly. 'This is a mega day for us. The first time the company has actually taken proper premises. And d'you know, the great thing is that Laurence hasn't even seen it. I'm afraid I just got on with it - if you wait, you wait forever. So I've got some cold champagne to celebrate.' </p> <p>'Is it decent?' asks Laurence, provocatively. He has already told me that they argue 'like Taylor and Burton'. </p> <p>The gravel announces another arrival. Jehovah's Witnesses. Laurence says: 'Well, they might want to buy the house, so let's be nice.' He opens the door. There are astonished sounds of recognition. 'Good morning!' sings Laurence, switching to full-beam. 'You're reaching into your bag... are you bringing out a standard lamp, like Mary Poppins? Oh, how kind of you! I'm in the middle of an interview at the moment, but you can leave it with me - I'll give it a go. Are there puzzles in it? Do you do horoscopes? Restaurant reviews?' Fifteen seconds after he opened the door, he's closing it, leaving the Witnesses roaring with laughter on the other side. </p> <p>Laurence grew up in Streatham, developing an early pash on aristocratic dynasties such as the Mitfords and the Sitwells to relieve the tedium of suburbia. His father, a surgeon, died of leukaemia when Laurence was nine, so he and his younger brother and sister were raised singlehandedly by their mother, increasingly affected by multiple sclerosis. The only time Laurence underplays anything is when talking about his childhood, which he calls 'very happy' and 'very comfortable and straightforward'. </p> <p>Taste hit him between the eyeballs when he was 11, and touring two local schools which had offered him a place. 'We drove up to Dulwich College in the car, just to have a look around, and I had a meltdown. \"I can't go to this school! It's vastly scary!\" And then we drove up to Alleyn's, and it was lovely: a redbrick country house. I placed Dulwich College as being Crippensville, and Alleyn's as being lovely, with dried flowers and Agas.' After O-levels, he went to Camberwell Art School, and from there, into a rubber-flooring company where he worked in marketing. </p> <p>When pushed, he admits his father's death probably had something to do with the pace of his teenage years. </p> <p>'I don't think it's a conscious decision, but there is this motivation to get on and do. You do suddenly understand that things can come to an end very suddenly and it's as well to get doing very quickly.' When he came over a bit creative, the only thing he could do was change the way he looked. 'I got to the stage where I was feeling a bit frustrated. So I thought: right, I'm going to grow my hair again. And I bought my first frock coat.' When the company was sold, he made the decision to try his hand at interior design, and worked on the Richmond and Criterion theatres. </p> <p>It was Jackie, then doing stints on Richard and Judy's sofa as the editor of Debrett's Wedding Guide, who mentioned to a producer friend that Laurence might be right for an interiors pilot. One of his colleagues on the first series was Liz Wagstaff, who became Hermione's godmother, and who was jailed last week for defrauding colleagues out of \u00a354,000, having claimed that she had cancer and needed the money for treatment. Jackie had given Wagstaff \u00a32,000. Can we talk about that? 'We can't, unfortunately, because Jackie's trying to broker a deal at the moment with I don't know which paper, to get some money back for people, the researchers and the runners who gave her \u00a3500.' </p> <p>While Gary takes his picture, Laurence directs me to items of interest elsewhere. 'Have you noticed the wallpaper? It's mine, \u00a39.99 a roll from Homebase. Please notice the photograph of me and Jackie with Prince Andrew. I'm not entirely sure of my motives in putting it out, but it was a lovely evening.' I get down on my hands and knees to inspect Cecile's doll's house. Clearly, she is her father's daughter: there is a bath in the sitting room, and one inhabitant is wedged into the fireplace. 'There's something so incredibly downmarket about being famous,' sighs Laurence happily, as one pose succeeds another. </p> <p>Later, I ring the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Georgian Group to check how to spell 'Adelaidian', but they've never heard the term before. I call the V &amp;A to find out more about the Changing Rooms archive but I can't find anyone there who is able to say whether it exists. 'I've been asking around, and nobody has heard of such an archive, so to say we have one is probably untrue,' says a spokesperson. Never mind. Laurence understands the importance of trompe l'oeil .</p>",

      "body": "<b>When I first met and fell in love with my husband, I was 20 and he was 44, married and the father of two grown-up daughters, 19 and 21. It was a very difficult situation but we were very much in love and married three years later. <p>Eleven years on, we're still together and have a beautiful nine-year-old son whom we both adore. I still love my husband, but I'm no longer happy. We have grown apart and want different things from life, particularly after he had a minor heart attack five years ago. He recovered well, but it changed him. </p><p>I feel very attracted to a man I have met at work. He's single, about my age and also attracted to me. I'm very tempted to have an affair, even leave my husband and start a new life with my son. </p><p>However, I can't forget what my husband gave up for me. His daughters haven't spoken to him since he left their mother for me. We know through other people that both girls are married and have children, but all my husband's attempts at a reconciliation have been rejected. When his former wife remarried four years ago we hoped that they would relent. But it didn't happen. </p></b> <p><b>How can I leave and still be able to live with myself? Sometimes I wonder whether they would acknowledge him again if I was out of the picture. Some people would say that I brought my problems upon myself. Nevertheless I would welcome your advice.</b> </p> <p> <i> M.C. of London </i></p> <p>You have mapped out your plans for the future with your own happiness in mind, and all that is left is the inconvenience of a smarting conscience, which you hope will be resolved by an approval, or at least justification, in this column. Well I don't think you can have that luxury. </p> <p>I sometimes think that morality - which forms no part whatsoever of our inheritance - has been invented by humans to disguise their invariably selfish motives. </p> <p>Place yourself in your husband's shoes; take the immense leap across the gender and generation gaps and see how he has been led by the pricking of his gonads and his vanity into a relationship that has served him ill. It seems there was little true rapport to supplement your passion. Once the novelty and the frisson of attracting a younger woman had dwindled and the ravages of age and stress began to make their mark on him, there was no long-term companion with whom love and friendship had been forged by a shared youth, history and the successful raising of a family. Someone who would not pull out when the hard times came. He probably blames himself as much as you for his instinctive folly, which has deprived him of the gentle delight of growing old in tandem with a soul-mate, and all his hopes for the future happily extending and expanding around him. </p> <p>His previous wife is totally out of his reach, his daughters unbending in their rejection. The loss of his children and grandchildren must be a bitter blow, and though he has irretrievably lost time and trust with them, he should continue his efforts to gain forgiveness. </p> <p>In this tale of destruction and rejection there is not a lot you can do to improve matters. I would doubt your motivation to continue in a lacklustre marriage, but you do have your son to consider. He would be better off with two parents than one, and it is undoubtedly in a child's interest to remain with his natural parents if he can. </p> <p>You speak of a new potential mate, but maybe this man at work is looking for a light-hearted affair rather than wife and ready-made son. Would you be as eager to discard your present marriage if there were no male arms waiting to receive you? </p> <p>Your husband would be better off without you; as you observe, there is a measure of hope for rehabilitation with his first family especially if he is prepared to eat humble pie with them. But he must not lose his son in addition; that would be too cruel. Whatever you do must include a plan to keep them together; you could even consider giving him custody of the boy. </p> <p> <b> READERS' REPLIES</b> </p> <p> 'Don't even think about it' is my instant advice.

      "bodyText": "When I first met and fell in love with my husband, I was 20 and he was 44, married and the father of two grown-up daughters, 19 and 21. It was a very difficult situation but we were very much in love and married three years later. Eleven years on, we're still together and have a beautiful nine-year-old son whom we both adore. I still love my husband, but I'm no longer happy. We have grown apart and want different things from life, particularly after he had a minor heart attack five years ago. He recovered well, but it changed him. I feel very attracted to a man I have met at work. He's single, about my age and also attracted to me. I'm very tempted to have an affair, even leave my husband and start a new life with my son. However, I can't forget what my husband gave up for me. His daughters haven't spoken to him since he left their mother for me. We know through other people that both girls are married and have children, but all my husband's attempts at a reconciliation have been rejected. When his former wife remarried four years ago we hoped that they would relent. But it didn't happen. How can I leave and still be able to live with myself? Sometimes I wonder whether they would acknowledge him again if I was out of the picture. Some people would say that I brought my problems upon myself. Nevertheless I would welcome your advice. M.C. of London You have mapped out your plans for the future with your own happiness in mind, and all that is left is the inconvenience of a smarting conscience, which you hope will be resolved by an approval, or at least justification, in this column. Well I don't think you can have that luxury. I sometimes think that morality - which forms no part whatsoever of our inheritance - has been invented by humans to disguise their invariably selfish motives. Place yourself in your husband's shoes; take the immense leap across the gender and generation gaps and see how he has been led by the pricking of his gonads and his vanity into a relationship that has served him ill. It seems there was little true rapport to supplement your passion. Once the novelty and the frisson of attracting a younger woman had dwindled and the ravages of age and stress began to make their mark on him, there was no long-term companion with whom love and friendship had been forged by a shared youth, history and the successful raising of a family. Someone who would not pull out when the hard times came. He probably blames himself as much as you for his instinctive folly, which has deprived him of the gentle delight of growing old in tandem with a soul-mate, and all his hopes for the future happily extending and expanding around him. His previous wife is totally out of his reach, his daughters unbending in their rejection. The loss of his children and grandchildren must be a bitter blow, and though he has irretrievably lost time and trust with them, he should continue his efforts to gain forgiveness. In this tale of destruction and rejection there is not a lot you can do to improve matters. I would doubt your motivation to continue in a lacklustre marriage, but you do have your son to consider. He would be better off with two parents than one, and it is undoubtedly in a child's interest to remain with his natural parents if he can. You speak of a new potential mate, but maybe this man at work is looking for a light-hearted affair rather than wife and ready-made son. Would you be as eager to discard your present marriage if there were no male arms waiting to receive you? Your husband would be better off without you; as you observe, there is a measure of hope for rehabilitation with his first family especially if he is prepared to eat humble pie with them. But he must not lose his son in addition; that would be too cruel. Whatever you do must include a plan to keep them together; you could even consider giving him custody of the boy. READERS' REPLIES 'Don't even think about it' is my instant advice. Strange perhaps coming from a man who left his wife four years ago with children at a similar age to M.C.'s lover at the time he left. Believe me, happiness is so elusive when you elect to take the unconventional course of action. You say you love your husband and no doubt your son even more. I see little hope of happiness in pursuing any form of liaison with the man at the office. No doubt you had critics at the time of your marriage, they will have a field day if you have another affair. A.S. of Surrey So you fell in love with and married a man much older than yourself, who was married to someone else when you met him and left his first wife and family to marry you and give you your 'beautiful' nine-year-old son. Since his heart attack he has 'changed' and you've found someone younger and more attractive. You are right not to forget what he gave up for you and wrong to think that whisking yourself and his son out of his life could make things easier for him with his former family. Imagine for a moment that it had been the other way round. That you had had the life-threatening illness and he had decided he'd be better off taking your son away to live with someone more attractive and healthy. How would you have felt? If you really did still love your husband you could not consider the action you propose. If you really have to get out of the relationship for your own sake, you still don't have the right to take your son away from him. I assume this boy loves his father.

A string of automotive clich\u00e9s, in fact, before you've had the privilege of sliding down into the leather-sheathed driving seat of the latest Ferrari 360 Modena. </p> <p>Turn the key, blip the drilled aluminium, racing-style throttle, and catapult yourself along Surrey Tarmac away from Maranello Concessionaries, Ferrari's UK HQ, and away into a magic mystery tour of the fastest A roads and B roads you've ever encountered. Faster than fairies, faster than witches, this silver-grey road-racer beguiles like no other car you'll meet in a year of Sundays. The 360 Modena is quite simply one of the finest cars I've driven, and this includes many older Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Maseratis and De Tomasos. And Jaguars, Porsches and Moss knows what. </p> <p>What this car does so well is prove that a car that would not disgrace itself on a race track can be used as everyday transport, if you're rich and sybaritic enough in spirit and wallet. Not that the 360 is a gas guzzler. It isn't. It's simply beautifully made, mostly of aluminium and thus very light, and for an Italian supercar extraordinary in that it looks and feels as well put together as a Porsche, and that's saying something. A Porsche is one of the most beautifully made machines you can buy with your own money. </p> <p>Not only does the car feel all of a piece, but it's a doddle to drive. No, seriously. Sure, if you're used to Mondeos and Meganes, you might find the stupendous power a little unsettling and the width of the car disturbing (at 6ft 4in, it's among the very widest), but you would soon delight in the way you can overtake everyone in sight at will and in any gear, the way in which the car zips around any corner at virtually any speed you choose with almost no body roll, the hugely powerful brakes, the go-kart steering and the blissful comfort of the seats. Beyond this, the interior is wonderfully moulded and stitched together, the exquisite testa rossa (red-headed) V8 engine visible behind the driver's head, and the air-con works a treat. </p> <p>You really can potter through town in this supremely potent car, sit in jams without fear of the 400bhp engine overheating, and cope easily with a clutch that is neither heavy nor sudden. Is this too much of a good thing? Shouldn't a Ferrari be a snarling, flame-haired bitch of a car, a popping, spitting machine that is only rightly happy at grossly illegal speeds screaming like a banshee up and down twisting mountain roads as if the devil (or the polizia) was on its tail-pipes? Yes and no. While it will lug around town in top gear, the 360 will, should you want it to, move with a speed and dexterity that will delight aficionados and quietly terrify those who might find it hard to believe that a car really can be so quick through corners, up hills and over humpbacks. Unlike other very fast cars, its tyres do not 'tramtrack' on rough roads, nor under heavy braking. It has no Jekyll-and-Hyde character whatsoever. It simply does faster and faster without ever losing its composure (as long as you don't lose yours). </p> <p>There is, though, a 'traction control' system that ensures every driver should manage their first fast turn in this car without embarrassing or frightening themselves. When you switch this safety device off, the car can be chucked around, despite its physical bulk, as if it was a Caterham 7. Only its width means that Britain's automotive terrier could get away from the Ferrari on B-roads. There are, dammit, times when discretion gives way to valour and, also because this \u00a3103,000 car isn't mine (sadly) and must be returned to its owners without so much as a thumbprint showing on its gleaming Pinifarina-designed bodywork. </p> <p>And, no, this is not a car you will feel embarrassed to drive. It has no fins or spoilers. Aerodynamic testing nurtured a body shape that needs nothing to hold it down. Instead, like a Formula One racer, the 360 hunches down automatically the faster you push it. It never feels as if it is about to take off as E-Types and Lamborghini Miuras have done, in my experience, as they enter two-mile-a-minute territory. I know you're not meant to drive cars this fast and yes, of course, it's all very boyish and so on, but I bet you would want to go very fast indeed, too, if I were able to give you the key to the 360 Modena. For one thing, the sound of the 40-valve engine - titanium con rods, forged aluminium pistons, four camshafts, hydraulic tappets_ phwoarr_ is as compelling as any fast movement from the great Ludwig Van. Sorry, I'm getting a bit carried away, but you try and curb your passion when let loose in what must be, by most standards, one of the finest and fastest road cars ever built. </p> <p>There are, however, several snags with the 360. The price, for one, unless you're a dot.com teenage trillionaire in which case you can afford to buy Fiat which own Ferrari several times over and have change to buy Porsche, too. Then there's the parking. You need a lot of space and bottle to park a Ferrari in the street. Do you dare to? Naturally, every Modena sold features a hidden global satellite tracking devise. If stolen, the car can be found anywhere in the world. It works, as several lucky Ferrari owners know to their advantage. The other snag is the waiting list: two-and-half-years. Still, by that time I might have decided to grow a goatee, talk mockney, wear combat trousers, design a web-site and, hey presto, have made a trillion pounds. Or, perhaps not. Whatever. The 360 Modena is a superb machine, a mechanical jewel and proof that the car as we've known it pretty much for a century has plenty of life in it yet. </p> <p>It must seem decadent to have driven to Liverpool in a Ferrari to give a talk in a parish church (my journey from London took six hours, though I did go via Oxford, Broadway, the Elan Valley, Welshpool, Chester, Birkenhead and the wonderful Mersey Tunnel rather than taking the M1/M6), but this magnificent car makes motoring as much fun as it was when I first got my licence. It just happens to cost about 2,000 times what I paid for my first car. Certain pleasures get much more expensive as the miles reel by.</p>",

However, Tonkin could not be further from the archetypal image of the cold, cerebral, scary architect. He is an unassuming character, dressed in a funny padded jacket (a touch Star Trek ) and trousers with little zips. But he is also remarkably straightforward and (most untypical, this) warm and human. This week, he and his associates will be manning the stand at the RIBA Lounge at the homes and interiors show, Mode, at north London's Business Design Centre. It is the show's second year. And a good thing, too, not least because it is one of the few places that the public can go in search of advice - or a whole new way of living - from a host of architects. </p> <p>Last year, the RIBA Lounge attracted a good deal of press attention and was one of the busiest sections of the show. For most of those queuing up, it was their first encounter with an architect. According to Tonkin, 'if you don't happen to know an architect, it is very difficult to know how to get in touch with one.' Tonkin, who is based in an endangered building at the back of King's Cross Station, next to the area's famous huge old oil tanks, has a very user-friendly approach to his work: asking, looking, playing and making. He spent the mid-90s in the Far East, doing just that, and creating an impressive body of work, which ranges from a Hong Kong hairdressing salon that looks like something from outer space, to the interior of the Lane Crawford department store, and a series of cinemas, all painted blood red inside to reflect Tonkin's theory that most films are about murder. The heat of the red just added to the thrill. </p> <p>While in Hong Kong, Tonkin met up with a nightclub owner, Christian Rhomberg. As well as designing various nightclubs for him, including the renowned Cube, and another club in Innsbruck, Austria, he designed his own home - a futuristic, organic space filled with colourful, glowing light. Pictures of the Rhomberg House caught the eye of 30-year-old Cassian Young, who attended Mode last year in search of an architect to transform his three-storey bachelor pad in a London mews. 'The ground floor was useless as it was,' he says. But his brief to Tonkin was quite vague: he was interested in light, and liked the work of the artist James Turrell. His only reference point was Turrell's 1993 piece, Air Mass . It featured a flat, rectangular glow of white light suspended in a sea of red. His budget was \u00a375,000. This is the sort of client most architects dream of. </p> <p>Twelve months later, the plans are finished, the 3-D model is made, and the work for the house is out to tender. Cassian's new home will be ingenious, with his sleeping quarters, kitchen, living and entertaining area divided between the floors. The house gets lighter and airier the higher you go, helped by four towers that bring light into the space from above. One tower is a shower unit, stretching the entire three storeys, another a light chamber taking natural light to the lower floor. There is also a stair/storage tower with his music system on top, and a shorter tower for the kitchen made out of planks of board. As in the Rhomberg House, everything will either glow or appear to float, just as in a James Turrell installation. </p> <p>Tonkin won a second commission at Mode: to rework a family house in Essex.

      "bodyText": "'People are scared of architects,' says Mike Tonkin. 'They think we're like the police.' However, Tonkin could not be further from the archetypal image of the cold, cerebral, scary architect. He is an unassuming character, dressed in a funny padded jacket (a touch Star Trek ) and trousers with little zips. But he is also remarkably straightforward and (most untypical, this) warm and human. This week, he and his associates will be manning the stand at the RIBA Lounge at the homes and interiors show, Mode, at north London's Business Design Centre. It is the show's second year. And a good thing, too, not least because it is one of the few places that the public can go in search of advice - or a whole new way of living - from a host of architects. Last year, the RIBA Lounge attracted a good deal of press attention and was one of the busiest sections of the show. For most of those queuing up, it was their first encounter with an architect. According to Tonkin, 'if you don't happen to know an architect, it is very difficult to know how to get in touch with one.' Tonkin, who is based in an endangered building at the back of King's Cross Station, next to the area's famous huge old oil tanks, has a very user-friendly approach to his work: asking, looking, playing and making. He spent the mid-90s in the Far East, doing just that, and creating an impressive body of work, which ranges from a Hong Kong hairdressing salon that looks like something from outer space, to the interior of the Lane Crawford department store, and a series of cinemas, all painted blood red inside to reflect Tonkin's theory that most films are about murder. The heat of the red just added to the thrill. While in Hong Kong, Tonkin met up with a nightclub owner, Christian Rhomberg. As well as designing various nightclubs for him, including the renowned Cube, and another club in Innsbruck, Austria, he designed his own home - a futuristic, organic space filled with colourful, glowing light. Pictures of the Rhomberg House caught the eye of 30-year-old Cassian Young, who attended Mode last year in search of an architect to transform his three-storey bachelor pad in a London mews. 'The ground floor was useless as it was,' he says. But his brief to Tonkin was quite vague: he was interested in light, and liked the work of the artist James Turrell. His only reference point was Turrell's 1993 piece, Air Mass . It featured a flat, rectangular glow of white light suspended in a sea of red. His budget was \u00a375,000. This is the sort of client most architects dream of. Twelve months later, the plans are finished, the 3-D model is made, and the work for the house is out to tender. Cassian's new home will be ingenious, with his sleeping quarters, kitchen, living and entertaining area divided between the floors. The house gets lighter and airier the higher you go, helped by four towers that bring light into the space from above. One tower is a shower unit, stretching the entire three storeys, another a light chamber taking natural light to the lower floor. There is also a stair/storage tower with his music system on top, and a shorter tower for the kitchen made out of planks of board. As in the Rhomberg House, everything will either glow or appear to float, just as in a James Turrell installation. Tonkin won a second commission at Mode: to rework a family house in Essex. It helped that Tonkin liked the house, a 60s dream home built by an American in the style of the Californian modernists. It featured an extraordinary red- and blue-tiled kitchen which won the Daily Mail Award for Ideal Kitchen in 1975. While the architect has tried to persuade the clients to keep as much of the original interior as possible, including wooden panelling, and some wild wallpaper, the main structural change to the house has been the installation of a 3m by 2.5m skylight in the living-room ceiling. Directly under the skylight, Tonkin has built a 'conversation pit' - a sunken area, padded and upholstered in the same dark fabric as the skylight. The idea is that the clients will be able to lie under the light and look up at the sky above; the glass will also be fitted with neon light, designed to light up rivers of water when it rains. The project is typical of Tonkin, who has treated the existing house sympathetically rather than going at it with a sledgehammer. Tonkin likes to analyse his clients a bit, to find out odd details about their lives and what they want from their home. 'Play the role of the man on the street,' he says. 'Play the feng-shui master, search for freaks, assume nothing.' He treats each job as a story, and the clients as characters within it. If you have a story to tell Mike Tonkin and his small team, or a problem that needs the help of an architect, the RIBA Lounge at this year's Mode is the easiest place to find one. Representatives from 30 practices will be available to discuss your dreams and needs, from your planned attic conversion to a vague idea of revamping your basement.

I remember being terribly flattered by Pete saying there was a good sense of direction to what I was doing. It was exactly what I wanted to hear because I didn't want to just make puppets do funny things. It made me think we had common aims. </p> <p>A few months later, I got a phone call from Aardman asking if I'd like to work there for a month in the summer break. It was a dream come true. I stayed with Pete's family when I first arrived in Bristol. I've always looked up to him as a very mature person. He's one of those people who makes you feel he's the one who is learning.

It was the first time we'd spent much of time together, and we talked about a lot of other things besides the film, like our shared love of nature. At first we were very polite to each other because we didn't want to step on each other's toes. But on a film of this scale, people need decisions quickly, so we had to become a lot more decisive.</p> <p>I relied a lot on Pete's confidence. He's much better with grown-ups than I am. He can get up and make speeches, and he'd challenge the writers and composers to give more. I just felt so scared of everyone at first. We had to pitch the idea for Chicken Run at a dinner with Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg - it was a chicken dinner. We just had a simple line: it's an escape movie with chickens. Luckily, Steven said that The Great Escape was one of his favourite films. I've learned a lot from Pete about listening to people's ideas and evaluating them in a way that allows people to feel they're contributing something. He is a good person to throw ideas at because he's so honest, without ever being harsh. He doesn't laugh at things unless they're funny. I tend to use my instincts as to what's funny and what isn't. I think his knowledge of English literature enables him to look at the overall picture, not to get bogged down with the details, as I do. </p> <p>Part of me longs to get back to Wallace and Gromit, because I feel more confident with them, but Chicken Run has stretched me in a good way, and it's been a genuine pleasure working with Pete. I think I would have cracked up if I'd tried to do it alone. Making a big film like this is creativity with a gun at your head. Neither of us could stand the pressure, but it was a comfort to know there was someone to share the load. </p> <p><b>Peter Lord </b> <br> I first met Nick at the National Film Theatre when he was a student and I'd already made quite a few films. Then we met up again at the National Film and TV School, where I'd gone with Dave Sproxton, my partner at Aardman, to talk to the students. It was Nick's idea for us to go. He showed us the storyboards for A Grand Day Out which were incredibly ambitious. He was very shy and quietly spoken, but it was immediately obvious he was highly talented. I was impressed that he was doing the whole thing himself. </p> <p>At the time, Aardman was just two blokes, Dave and me, but we had aspirations to become a proper studio. After the Channel 4 series, Conversation Pieces, we found ourselves flavour of the month and we were able to start thinking in terms of expansion. Nick was the obvious choice to join the team. We worked together on the Peter Gabriel video, Sledgehammer. Quite early on I was aware of his genius. He had a precision that was really striking. He certainly didn't need any help from me. I remember thinking, 'I could never do that!' </p> <p>Until then, I'd thought I was the best at what I was doing, then along came someone who was better. I didn't resent it but I'd be pretty unnatural if I hadn't felt jealous at times. But it's impossible to dislike Nick; he's so nice about his success. </p> <p>And I wasn't alone. I think every other animator in Britain felt as I did. I was very proud for him when he won the Oscars for Wallace &amp; Gromit. I don't take any credit for his talent - he came to us fully fledged - but I do take credit for giving him the environment to make it happen. </p> <p>On a simple level, we're surprisingly alike. We both love to be alone, both love the country. We exchange wildlife stories after little country forays, but we don't really discuss aesthetic or intellectual things that much. Nick isn't a great one for books. We find the same things funny, both in terms of sight gags and more subtle, observational things. We've been allies against the world during the making of Chicken Run . </p> <p>When we started on the film I was effectively creative director of Aardman, which was a full-time job, so it was a big decision to give that up to concentrate full-time on Chicken Run . I thought, 'If I don't do this now, it'll be a long time before another opportunity like this comes along.' </p> <p>We'd never worked together much because Nick had always been so self-sufficient. Considering we've been closeted together for four and a half years, it's amazing we've never had an argument. We've disagreed on a few things, but I very seldom argue with anyone. The big problem has been the regime we've had to work under. We never really got on top of it. Despite being the directors, we've been slaves to the production. </p> <p>It was nice to be able to retreat to our office together and have a moan. The dread of it not being successful was always a fear. What if everyone compared it to the Wallace &amp; Gromit s and found it lacking? I could see the headlines: 'Nick Park teams up with Peter Lord to create turkey'. </p> <p>Chicken Run opens on 30 June </p>",

      "body": "<p>The sight of a pile of curling broad beans for sale on a hot, dusty day always brings back memories of picking them in the cool of the evening. Their arrival marks the beginning of summer for me. They may not be the sexiest vegetable in the world, but their complex, earthy flavour is sophisticated. It can take time to acquire a taste for them, but now is the best time to try - if you are not already smitten.</p> <p>The air has already become sweet with the scent of their blossom. Tiny purple and white flowers hide beneath their rustling grey-green leaves. Avid eaters inspect their gardens daily, waiting for the first crop of pea-sized broad beans, cushioned in small, velvet-lined pods. These are the petit pois of the bean world, so sweet and juicy, they rarely reach the pot. Within a few weeks they will swell into plump, jade-green specimens, before finally becoming so tough and mealy that most cooks avoid them like the plague.</p> <p>I have to admit that I only developed a taste for broad beans relatively late in life. It was not an instant conversion, rather an increasing delight in their subtle flavour. Even now you won't catch me eating overly large broad beans unless they have been slipped out of their tough outer husk. This requires dropping the shelled beans into a pan of boiling water and cooking them for four or five minutes, before cooling them and laboriously extricating the bright-green inner kernels. It is a trick worth trying on broad-bean haters later in the summer if you are struggling to use up a rampant crop. The denuded beans can be tossed into a salad or reheated in some cream with a hint of sage or summer savoury.</p> <p>Once you develop a passion for broad beans, it is hard to resist snaffling them up whenever you see them. The season starts with Italian imports early in May; the English crop only begins now, with the warmer weather. According to Fred Foster, the greengrocer behind Turnips in London's Borough Market (020 7645 3551), aficionados can distinguish between the Italian and English varieties. Apparently, Italian broad beans have a mellow, well-rounded flavour, whereas their greener English counterparts are more sappy and intense. 'It's all due to our rain,' he states, mysteriously. 'Somehow it gives them a more leafy taste, just like it makes our peas sweeter.' Since broad beans grow at night, Fred reckons that English ones are only superlative when they have warm sunny days and mizzly nights.</p> <p>For now, I am content to get my beans home and settle down to the soothing task of shelling them - preferably with a cool drink. Being of a somewhat lazy disposition, I tend to eat them as part of another dish rather than as an accompanying vegetable. A handful of tiny beans tastes delicious in a pea risotto, for example, especially if it has had some pur\u00e9ed pea added to the cooking broth. Perfect for supper. They taste equally good mixed into a simple dish of garlicky pasta, perhaps with a little goat's cheese, which melts into a sticky, piquant sauce. A touch of chervil, parsley, tarragon, basil or chives further enhances their sweet, fresh flavour.</p> <p>However, if you are going to accompany a broad bean with anything, it has to be bacon. Choose the best dry-cured brand you can find, dice it and fry until crisp before mixing in a little spring onion or garlic and your lightly boiled beans. When you have wearied of eating them as a vegetable, mix the bacon into a broad bean salad, perhaps with a few plump prawns or crumbled feta cheese and skinned and seeded diced tomatoes.</p> <p>Despite greed, it is never easy to gauge how many kilos of beans to buy. As a general guide, one kilo should yield about 250g, enough for three people of moderate appetite. Choose fresh-looking pods and don't worry too much about black spotting - it is caused by rain and won't affect the flavour of the beans. But don't even consider eating black spotted beans if they also look tired and shrivelled - they will be past their best. If you are pushed for time or feeling frazzled, you could surreptitiously smuggle in some ready-shelled broad beans from Marks &amp; Spencer. They come in 190g packets and are surprisingly sweet despite looking a little grey - perhaps as a result of being flown in from Africa. But don't admit such a weakness to any farming friends.</p> <p><b> Bean soup with cr\u00e8me frache and sage</b> <br> The sage brings out the inherent sweetness of fresh broad beans. Serve chilled or warm, and add little croutons or snip in some chives. Serves a generous 4.</p> <p>3 tbsps olive oil</p> <p>2 small onions, roughly chopped</p> <p>2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped</p> <p>1 litre good chicken stock</p> <p>700g shelled broad beans</p> <p>2 large sage leaves, roughly chopped</p> <p>200ml cr\u00e8me frache</p> <p>Warm the olive oil in a saucepan and gently fry the onions and garlic over a low heat until soft. Add the stock, increase the heat and bring to the boil. Add the beans and return to the boil. Cook briskly for 12 minutes or until all the beans are soft.</p> <p>Remove from the heat, add the chopped fresh sage and liquidise while still piping hot. Then strain the soup through a sieve and stir in the cr\u00e8me frache. Season to taste with salt, freshly ground black pepper and, if wished, a pinch of caster sugar.</p> <p>If you are eating this warm, reheat when ready to serve. Alternatively, cover and chill until needed. In either case, ladle into six soup bowls and eat with lots of crusty bread or garnish to taste.</p> <p><b> Bean, beetroot and goat's cheese salad</b> <br> If you can't find fresh baby beetroot, buy about 225g of the smallest cooked beetroot and cut it into segments. Plain Perroche goat's cheese is available from Neal's Yard Dairy (020 7645 3555). Serves 6.</p> <p>2 bunches baby beetroot</p> <p>225g shelled young broad beans</p> <p>leaves from a small bunch of flat-leaf parsley</p> <p>leaves from 2 springs of tarragon</p> <p>1 small bunch of chives, finely sliced</p> <p>3 x 150g plain Perroche or other fresh goat's cheese</p> <p>6 handfuls mixed salad leaves</p> <p>extra olive oil</p> <p><b> for the vinaigrette</b> <br> 1 small clove garlic, finely chopped</p> <p>1 tbsp white-wine vinegar</p> <p>3 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil</p> <p>If you are using raw beetroot, trim the leaves to within 2.5cm of the root and scrub it clean.

      "bodyText": "The sight of a pile of curling broad beans for sale on a hot, dusty day always brings back memories of picking them in the cool of the evening. Their arrival marks the beginning of summer for me. They may not be the sexiest vegetable in the world, but their complex, earthy flavour is sophisticated. It can take time to acquire a taste for them, but now is the best time to try - if you are not already smitten. The air has already become sweet with the scent of their blossom. Tiny purple and white flowers hide beneath their rustling grey-green leaves. Avid eaters inspect their gardens daily, waiting for the first crop of pea-sized broad beans, cushioned in small, velvet-lined pods. These are the petit pois of the bean world, so sweet and juicy, they rarely reach the pot. Within a few weeks they will swell into plump, jade-green specimens, before finally becoming so tough and mealy that most cooks avoid them like the plague. I have to admit that I only developed a taste for broad beans relatively late in life. It was not an instant conversion, rather an increasing delight in their subtle flavour. Even now you won't catch me eating overly large broad beans unless they have been slipped out of their tough outer husk. This requires dropping the shelled beans into a pan of boiling water and cooking them for four or five minutes, before cooling them and laboriously extricating the bright-green inner kernels. It is a trick worth trying on broad-bean haters later in the summer if you are struggling to use up a rampant crop. The denuded beans can be tossed into a salad or reheated in some cream with a hint of sage or summer savoury. Once you develop a passion for broad beans, it is hard to resist snaffling them up whenever you see them. The season starts with Italian imports early in May; the English crop only begins now, with the warmer weather. According to Fred Foster, the greengrocer behind Turnips in London's Borough Market (020 7645 3551), aficionados can distinguish between the Italian and English varieties. Apparently, Italian broad beans have a mellow, well-rounded flavour, whereas their greener English counterparts are more sappy and intense. 'It's all due to our rain,' he states, mysteriously. 'Somehow it gives them a more leafy taste, just like it makes our peas sweeter.' Since broad beans grow at night, Fred reckons that English ones are only superlative when they have warm sunny days and mizzly nights. For now, I am content to get my beans home and settle down to the soothing task of shelling them - preferably with a cool drink. Being of a somewhat lazy disposition, I tend to eat them as part of another dish rather than as an accompanying vegetable. A handful of tiny beans tastes delicious in a pea risotto, for example, especially if it has had some pur\u00e9ed pea added to the cooking broth. Perfect for supper. They taste equally good mixed into a simple dish of garlicky pasta, perhaps with a little goat's cheese, which melts into a sticky, piquant sauce. A touch of chervil, parsley, tarragon, basil or chives further enhances their sweet, fresh flavour. However, if you are going to accompany a broad bean with anything, it has to be bacon. Choose the best dry-cured brand you can find, dice it and fry until crisp before mixing in a little spring onion or garlic and your lightly boiled beans. When you have wearied of eating them as a vegetable, mix the bacon into a broad bean salad, perhaps with a few plump prawns or crumbled feta cheese and skinned and seeded diced tomatoes. Despite greed, it is never easy to gauge how many kilos of beans to buy. As a general guide, one kilo should yield about 250g, enough for three people of moderate appetite. Choose fresh-looking pods and don't worry too much about black spotting - it is caused by rain and won't affect the flavour of the beans. But don't even consider eating black spotted beans if they also look tired and shrivelled - they will be past their best. If you are pushed for time or feeling frazzled, you could surreptitiously smuggle in some ready-shelled broad beans from Marks &amp; Spencer. They come in 190g packets and are surprisingly sweet despite looking a little grey - perhaps as a result of being flown in from Africa. But don't admit such a weakness to any farming friends. Bean soup with cr\u00e8me frache and sage The sage brings out the inherent sweetness of fresh broad beans. Serve chilled or warm, and add little croutons or snip in some chives. Serves a generous 4. 3 tbsps olive oil 2 small onions, roughly chopped 2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped 1 litre good chicken stock 700g shelled broad beans 2 large sage leaves, roughly chopped 200ml cr\u00e8me frache Warm the olive oil in a saucepan and gently fry the onions and garlic over a low heat until soft. Add the stock, increase the heat and bring to the boil. Add the beans and return to the boil. Cook briskly for 12 minutes or until all the beans are soft. Remove from the heat, add the chopped fresh sage and liquidise while still piping hot. Then strain the soup through a sieve and stir in the cr\u00e8me frache. Season to taste with salt, freshly ground black pepper and, if wished, a pinch of caster sugar. If you are eating this warm, reheat when ready to serve. Alternatively, cover and chill until needed. In either case, ladle into six soup bowls and eat with lots of crusty bread or garnish to taste. Bean, beetroot and goat's cheese salad If you can't find fresh baby beetroot, buy about 225g of the smallest cooked beetroot and cut it into segments. Plain Perroche goat's cheese is available from Neal's Yard Dairy (020 7645 3555). Serves 6. 2 bunches baby beetroot 225g shelled young broad beans leaves from a small bunch of flat-leaf parsley leaves from 2 springs of tarragon 1 small bunch of chives, finely sliced 3 x 150g plain Perroche or other fresh goat's cheese 6 handfuls mixed salad leaves extra olive oil for the vinaigrette 1 small clove garlic, finely chopped 1 tbsp white-wine vinegar 3 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil If you are using raw beetroot, trim the leaves to within 2.5cm of the root and scrub it clean. Put it in a saucepan, liberally cover with cold water and set over a medium heat. Bring to the boil until the beetroot is tender and peels easily. It should take 20 minutes in all. Drain and set aside. Once it is cool enough to handle, don a pair of rubber gloves (to avoid pink hands) and snip off the roots and peel away the skin. Cut in half and place in a small bowl. Drop the broad beans into a pan of boiling water and cook for 4 minutes until tender. Drain and cool under the cold tap, then pat dry in kitchen paper. Preheat the grill to medium high. Whisk together the garlic, vinegar and olive oil. Season to taste. Finely chop the parsley and tarragon leaves and place in a bowl. Mix in the chives. Cut each goat's cheese in half and dip into the herbs, gently pressing them in, so each cheese is lightly coated. Place on an oiled baking sheet and drizzle each with a little oil. Grill for 4 minutes or until they are flecked golden. Meanwhile, pour all but a spoonful of the dressing into the broad beans. Add the salad leaves and toss before dividing the mixture between 6 plates. Arrange in airy piles. Use the remaining vinaigrette to dress the cooked beetroot and slip it in among the leaves. Add the hot cheese and serve immediately with good wholemeal or walnut bread. Tagliatelle tossed with beans and bacon Serves 6 for supper. 350g shelled young broad beans 250g dried egg tagliatelle 12 slices dry cured smoked back bacon 5-6 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil 1 fat clove garlic 1 bunch of spring onions finely grated zest of 1 lemon a handful basil leaves, finely sliced Bring a small pan of water to the boil. Add the beans and cook for 4 minutes until tender. Drain and set aside. Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water. Drain once cooked. Meanwhile, trim the fat off the bacon and cut into medium-sized dice. Heat 3 tbsps olive oil in a frying pan and fry the bacon until it is just beginning to turn crispy. Stir in the garlic and spring onions. Continue to cook for one minute, then mix in the beans and lemon zest. As soon as they are hot, add the cooked tagliatelle and basil, with olive oil to taste and lots of freshly ground black pepper. Serve immediately. Nigel Slater will be back next week",

      "body": "<p>W hen Peter Drake appeared on the porch of his farmhouse, smiling through the gloom of an African dusk, it seemed as if there must have been a mistake. The kindly softness of his welcome seemed unlikely to belong to the type of man we had been expecting to meet. He ushered in his visitors, and it was not long before he had offered these strangers some supper and a bed for the night. He wouldn't hear of a hotel, and his wife was quite insistent. </p> <p>'You must understand,' she confided, 'South Africans are very hospitable people.' Then she checked herself, and paused to reconsider. 'Well,' she corrected herself, 'South African farmers are, anyway.' </p> <p>Peter Drake is a farmer, and his wife, Karen, is a ballet teacher. They live in the lush curl of a mountain pass in the north- eastern tip of South Africa, not all that far, Peter says, 'from Rhode_ I mean, Zimbabwe'. They grow fruit on the family farm and live in a roomy, remote house with their three sweet-natured daughters. The eldest is the local high-school beauty queen, and she drifted in and out throughout the evening, bringing teenage smiles and updates of the cricket on the TV next door. The Drakes lead a quiet life, and that is how they like it. But Peter was glad of the opportunity to speak about their one local difficulty. </p> <p>He began by talking a bit about how he has come to disapprove of apartheid since its abolition, and about his fear that the ANC government is failing to enforce law and order. Politics per se does not really interest him, he confessed, but there is one issue that concerns him a great deal: he is monumentally worried about crime. This formula of views is extremely common among white South Africans, but the tone of his delivery suggested an unusually thoughtful mind, one in the habit of measuring up the morality of an opinion before venturing it. He carried on talking in his easy, level way, and presently remarked that whenever he sees massacres committed in Africa on the television, he is horrified. He asks himself how Africans can butcher their neighbours in cold blood. But then, he continued, he always remembers what his own team of farm hands is capable of, every time he orders them to abduct a local 'criminal', tie him up and whip the living daylights out of him. </p> <p>'When I see how my committee guys are willing to give a guy a hiding, I see how these black atrocities in Africa get committed. You just wouldn't believe how brutal they are.' He paused, let out a low whistle, and shook his head. 'The black man, he's brutal.' His guys are so brutal, Peter has to stand over them while they administer the beating he has ordered, to make sure they don't go overboard and kill the man. 'I'm like the Nazi Gestapo guy,' he explained. 'I monitor the beatings.' </p> <p>Peter Drake is a middle-aged farmer who thinks of himself as a decent man, but he is also branch leader of a South African organisation called Mapogo-a-Mathamaga. 'We say it isn't a vigilante outfit,' he remarked, 'but that's what it is.' </p> <p>Mapogo was founded late in 1996 by a handful of black businessmen, originally as a local response to a crimewave in their small rural town. Today, its founding president, John Magolego, tours South Africa urging the public to sign up. The meetings he holds are not unlike religious revivalist affairs, and the vigilante action he preaches is straightforwardly candid. </p> <p>'We don't consider that a criminal has human rights,' Magolego explained. 'He has got no rights of keeping his mouth shut when asked to tell the truth of his crime. If he keeps his mouth shut, we open it, and we don't spare the rod. We believe in corporal punishment. Our punishment,' - the words are trotted out in a happy sing-song - 'is always the sjambok on the buttocks of the criminal.' (The sjambok is a stiff, leather South African whip.) In his crisp suit and gold cufflinks, flanked by bodyguards, Magolego spelt out his organisation's contempt for Western-style justice in South Africa. </p> <p>'The right to silence? No, no, no, we don't want that. And criminals should not have lawyers - they just help perpetrate crime. If I know you have taken my car and I've seen you driving it, then what the hell do you need a lawyer for? That's my car! And everyone knows that's my car! So the lawyer is just someone to get you off when you are guilty.' The Mapogo solution to crime is altogether more simple. 'The criminal must just be made to lie on the floor and feel the pain.' </p> <p>When Peter Drake heard that Magolego was coming to address his home town last year, he remembers, 'I thought, this is like Father Christmas coming here.' He and other farmers were fed up with local break-ins, and with workers stealing produce and getting into drunken fights. Crime never used to be a problem, and they were unhappy about it, so they ordered their labourers to attend Magolego's meeting. Persuaded by what he heard, Drake promptly ordered every one of his 60 workers to pay up and join Mapogo, or leave his farm. He then selected a committee of eight farmhands - his 'top guys' - and the next time a crime was committed on his farm, Drake's unit swung into action. They caught a man laying a snare, tried him in a bush court in Drake's shed on the spot, and sentenced him to 25 lashes. Drake called the local farmers, who summoned all their workers to witness the inaugural Mapogo flogging. </p> <p>Ever since then, Drake and his team have been busy all over the province, beating up blacks. Every Mapogo member is supposed to be active in solving and punishing fellow members' crimes, but in practice many prefer to call Drake and his team - a responsibility Drake takes seriously, but speaks of lightly, much in the manner of a gardener describing his latest solution to greenfly. Occasionally, Karen would chip in with the odd comment, and smile supportively. 'It's like beating a dog,' she murmured. 'You have to do it quickly, so they learn their lesson.' </p> <p>A Mapogo court case is 'just like a normal court', Drake explained, 'but very condensed. We work swiftly.' When a victim contacts him, he and his team go and fetch the accused straight away, and drive him to a 'forsaken spot' where Drake interrogates him. 'If the guy denies the crime, we say OK, tell us who saw you not doing it. You see, it's a fair trial.' If the suspect still pleads innocence, Drake instructs his committee to beat him. 'Oh, and we wear Balaclavas,' he added, 'that's a must.' After a shortish beating, the perpetrator 'usually admits he did it', and Drake and his team then discuss the appropriate punishment. For smaller crimes, say the stealing of a pen, they would decide to give 15 or 20 lashes, but for a big crime it could be 150 to 200. 'The idea,' Drake explained, 'is if you hammer the small crimes, they don't get bigger. It began in New York, I think. It's called zero tolerance.' </p> <p>The windows of the Drakes' house were heavily barred, and on the sideboard was a rifle, a bullet-proof vest and a two-way radio which connects the household with a chain of other white farms along the valley, so that assistance can be summoned quickly in an emergency. As a demonstration, Peter broadcast a request for responses, and a crackle of taut, pseudo-military barks came echoing back through the night - Karen smiled tightly as she counted them off on her fingers. These are the voices of frightened people who complain about what they consider the necessity of having to live under such conditions. Although they wouldn't say they still supported apartheid, they firmly believe that the new democracy is to blame. </p> <p>'I know the black man through and through,' Drake repeated several times. 'I understand him, and democracy undermines the black man's historical bloodlines and traditions - what he understands is power and respect. You can't tell me you can teach an illiterate individual first-world principles, and I'd say 80 per cent of this country is illiterate. It's ruthless, the beating, but that's how these chaps grow up. I don't like what happens, but it has to happen; it's a system devised by the black man, for the black man - and it works. The blacks are like children: you have to be harsh and hard. And fair, obviously.' Mapogo membership is rising fast, despite the fact that at least eight members are in jail on murder charges. Peter Drake interprets any police action against members as 'harassment', and is thoroughly indignant. </p> <p>'The thing that shocks me,' he reflected, 'is that I'm degraded to the level where I actually have to go out and lynch these people. I don't want to have to degrade myself like that. It's the government's job.' </p> <p>This is a striking view of the job of government, but perhaps not as striking as the scale of its popularity. Mapogo now has approximately 60,000 members, the majority black, making it South Africa's largest vigilante organisation, but by no means its only one. Since apartheid was dismantled, recorded levels of every category of crime have risen dramatically, while the number of prosecutions and convictions has been steadily falling. When asked if they feel safe in the new South Africa, the majority of South Africans say that they do not, and confidence in the police has sunk to dangerously low levels. Crime dominated the national conversation in the 90s, but talk is now giving way to action as vigilante groups spread across the country, administering crudely improvised justice in the form of beatings and murders and bombs. Their strength has reached such levels that army trucks have even had to be stationed on the tourist beaches of Cape Town, and special police units have been set up to deal exclusively with vigilante crimes. But there is evidence of police officers themselves being active in vigilante groups, and the very concept of justice looks to be increasingly obscured by the swirl of conspiracy theories, corruption allegations and rival claims to righteousness endlessly staked by vigilantes, police and criminals. Vigilantism's corrosive effect on the distinction between right and wrong has profound consequences. With everyone claiming the moral high ground in the name of justice, it is less and less clear that anyone is upholding the law. </p> <p>The relationship between crime and vigilantism, however, is perfectly clear. Mapogo is well known, but its members are concentrated in the rural north of the country where crime levels remain relatively low. It is in the big urban centres, where organised crime has doubled since the ANC took power, that a new strain of vigilante has emerged, one to make Peter Drake and his sjambok look mildly quaint. South Africa's organised crime problem now ranks second only to that of Columbia and Russia, and police files have identified 500 different gangs, describing a small number as 'extremely well-financed and superbly armed'. Several gang leaders have achieved the status of household names, and Cape Town, traditionally the nation's mother city, is now known as the gang capital of the new South Africa. </p> <p>'Sea Point was full of big money. Nice money - casinos, bars, prostitutes. Nice big money, heh heh heh!' Gansie Uys is a senior member of a notorious Cape Town gang known as the Hard Livings, and he gurgled fondly as he relived the memory of his take-over of Sea Point, a lively strip of Cape Town which is no longer as affluent as it was before the Hard Livings moved in. </p> <p>Uys was delighted to pose for pictures with his gun and his gangster tattoos, and talked proudly of the Hard Livings' achievements. He has had his four front teeth removed, though - a popular fashion statement among Cape coloured gangsters - and his words came out in a gummy slur. </p> <p>'We took over everything. Prostitutes, they needed us to look after them, and they needed drugs. So they were our customers and our daily bread. Protection for the clubs, that was normal - if they don't pay, then it closes. You will be too scared to open if you don't pay us, so you pay. Maybe R4,000 or R5,000 (\u00a3400 to \u00a3500) a week. And then we sell our drugs inside. Mandrax, crack, cocaine, Ecstasy_ We pay the police off. They don't earn a lot. They are always hungry. No cigarettes,' he beamed. 'They are big boozers, and that makes it nice for us.' How many people did he think he had killed? 'Ooh, I don't know. Not many. Maybe 10.' </p> <p>Uys's willingness to gloat like this on record gives some idea of how little the official forces of law figure in the minds of the gangs. White South Africans in cities such as Cape Town know this and, despairing of police protection, subscribe instead to armed private security companies with names like Sniper Security. Private guards now outnumber police officers in South Africa by 4.5 to one, and have been to known to stray outside the law in their line of duty. In the townships, people have learnt to rely on a more informal form of vigilante justice. </p> <p>'The taxi guys are very powerful,' explained one young man who had recently used their services to recover stolen property. 'They're the people who don't give a shit.' The mini-bus taxi routes between the townships and Cape Town are traditionally lucrative, and rival operators have fought spectacularly bloody battles for control. The drivers acquired a fearful reputation as de facto elders - and so have come to function in some communities as the arbiters of local justice. This is an example of taxi vigilantism in action. A teenage girl on the Cape Flats was gang raped last year, and her family took her to the local taxi people. The young culprits she named were swiftly rounded up, and a makeshift kangaroo court followed, where the girl identified the rapists. The youths, barely more than boys, were stripped naked, tied up, and the girl was handed a sjambok and urged to give them a whipping. A TV crew filmed the whole affair, and harrowing footage of the boys screaming and bleeding caused a minor stir in liberal circles when it was broadcast. </p> <p>But taxi vigilantism has been broadly eclipsed by more dramatic recent developments in Cape Town. An organisation calling itself Pagad - People Against Gangsters and Drugs - emerged in the city in 1996, and in due course it gave a public demonstration of its preferred method of dealing with crime. The media were invited to a Pagad rally, which began in a mosque with an address to a crowd of 4,000, and the following scenes were filmed. </p> <p>'The legal process has collapsed!' screamed the speaker. 'There is nothing the police can do about the gangsters. Enough is enough!' A chant broke out, led by men in masks: 'Are the drug merchants and the gangsters your enemies? Yes! Are they the enemies of the community? Yes! So what must we do? Kill them!' The crowd poured out of the mosque into a convoy of vehicles, and descended upon the home of Rashaad Staggie, then leader of the Hard Livings. In full view of a massive police deployment, the mob swarmed around the house - Staggie appeared, and a masked man shot him through the head. Staggie fell to the ground pouring with blood, and an ambulance man rushed to help him, but another masked man got there first, doused Staggie in petrol, and set him on fire. As Staggie stumbled and lurched to his feet, wrapped in flames, the crowd bayed: 'God is great! God is great! While he lay dying on the pavement, 75 more bullets entered his body, and men swarmed around the charred corpse, kicking and beating his head. A helpless medical crew cowered in their ambulance, as the mob hammered on the windows screaming: 'Fuck off or we shoot you, too! Fuck off or you die!' </p> <p>Staggie's televised killing was followed by the murder of more than 30 other senior gang leaders in drive-by shootings. The government took fright and made attempts to contain the group's violence, at which point the state itself appeared to become its new target, and Pagad's anti-gangster statements assumed an Islamic fundamentalist tone. A detective assigned to investigate the organisation was assasinated, and a series of bombs exploded across the city through the course of last year; a young British tourist lost her foot in one blast and the Foreign Office declared the city unsafe for tourists before Christmas. On Christmas Eve, a policewoman lost her leg in a booby-trap blast, and Cape Town passed into the new millennium under heavy police and army patrol. In January, a court was bombed on the day that two Pagad members were appearing. More than 50 members are now awaiting trial on charges of murder, extortion and related offences, and police chiefs speak privately of urban war. Undeterred, Pagad continues to speak publicly of victory. </p> <p>'We will eradicate gangsterism and drugs,' a Pagad spokeswoman stated calmly, 'by all means necessary.' We met at Cape Town magistrate's court following a bail hearing for Pagad's leader, who had just been arrested and charged with the murder of Staggie, and she talked with a crisp, cool lucidity. 'Through the years, there have been many attempts to deal with the gangsters. It didn't work. Neighbourhood watches, police forums - it was not enough. A clear message had to be given to the gangsters. We are not interested in peace deals and negotiations, we are interested in eradication. We want to get rid of gangs - turn them off. And it is working.' While she was speaking, a crowd of Pagad supporters had gathered outside the court, and sturdy Muslim grandmothers in headscarves, pounding fists in the air, could be heard chanting over and over: 'One gangster, one bullet!' </p> <p>Two questions present themselves in the face of scenes such as these. How was crime in South Africa allowed to reach levels that would provoke grandmothers to incite murder, and middle-class family men to don Balaclavas and whip their own workers? And why do these people, decent and law-abiding by their own estimation, imagine they have the right to terrorise a newly legitimised South Africa in the name of justice? The new government is commonly blamed on both counts, for being too incompetent to keep order - but the causes are more complex than that. A culture of crime and a spirit of vigilantism are considerably older than democracy in South Africa. </p> <p>It is a political truth that the transition from any police state to democracy is always characterised by a weakening of law-enforcement structures. Uncertainty among the police about their changing future - and in some cases outright resistance - created enviable openings for criminals in South Africa, just as it has in the former Soviet Union. Police are also taking some time to learn the new skills of detection and investigation they need to combat crime, now that they are no longer able to rely on their old method of extracting 'confessions'. But apartheid did more than merely create a law- enforcement vacuum when it died: it spent its last years deliberately nurturing the very gangs who are now responsible for the crimewave in South Africa. </p> <p>The origins of the modern Cape Town gangs provide the best illustration of this. They date back to the late 60s, when the coloured population of the city was forcibly removed and dumped in townships out on a bleak sheet of land to the east, persecuted by wind and dust, known as the Cape Flats. Gangs formed quickly in the shattered communities, but the police state was then efficient at putting their leaders in prison. When political unrest flared in the 80s, however, the police released these leaders and paid them to terrorise anti-apartheid activists in the townships. It was a cosy relationship in which gangsters bought their freedom with acts of violence on behalf of apartheid, and police duly turned a blind eye to their other criminal activities. When the apartheid state began to crumble, Cape Flats gangs were already in a strong position to exploit the disarray - and they believed they had a notional justification for their crimes. </p> <p>'The political agreement chiselled out by the parties included the idea of amnesty for political offences,' explained Irvine Kinnes, who grew on the Cape Flats, and recently completed an MA on the gangs. 'To the gang members, this represented a freedom to commit crime and get away with it_ They didn't distinguish between their own crimes and those of the liberation movement - if political leaders were \"getting away\" with their crimes, why couldn't they?' It wasn't long before the gangs had progressed from street crime to racketeering, gun running and international drug smuggling. </p> <p>If democracy inherited a gang problem, it has also inherited a long history of South Africans taking the law into their own hands. Rural black communities were not famous for being well served by effective policing, and so it was village elders who would administer justice. Migrant workers imported this tradition to the townships, communities also infamously ill-served by the state's police. White rural settlers, too, have traditionally considered themselves entitled to punish transgressions on their land without recourse to law, and Afrikaner animosity towards British rule was fuelled by irritation at the colonial habit of believing courts of law were the proper place to resolve disagreements. </p> <p>Vigilantism thrives when the link between state and justice has been so corroded that any given group can indulge its often illegal desires - be it drug smuggling, racist violence or Islamic fundamentalism - and still present itself as a champion of justice. This corrosion has eaten so deeply into South Africa that even the gangs themselves are now affecting a public re-invention of themselves as the anti-crime guardians of their communities. They have formed a political movement called Core, purporting to signify their commitment to peace, and some 3,000 Cape Flats gangsters marched on parliament under its banner. The leader of the Hard Livings, Rashaad Staggie's brother Rashid, has recently converted to Christianity, turned his old shebeen into a church, and come up with a theory that gangsters themselves are 'new victims of apartheid' - a view that has been endorsed by some prominent church leaders. In this Alice in Wonderland analysis, the new government is to blame for the rise in crime, because it curtailed police powers and abol ished the death penalty. If criminals can now get away with murder, then nobody is safe - and so, reason the gangs, it falls to them to administer justice and keep the peace. </p> <p>'It's better like this,' explained Gansie Uys, while opening a bottle of beer with a pistol. He prefers to call himself a community leader, not a gangster. 'We help the people, we protect them. The community likes us.' </p> <p>There is an element of awful truth in this. Police corruption is so endemic, and incompetence so legendary, that many South Africans do regard local gangsters as their best hope of protection. One in four officers in Johannesburg was under investigation for a criminal offence in 1996. Such statistics are well known, and reports of negligence circulate daily. In January, for example, a Cape Town politician phoned a township police station to report a crime, but after 20 minutes nobody had answered the phone. When she gave up and drove to the station, she found lengthy queues waiting at the counter, several phones ringing - and the staff gathered around a TV, engrossed in an episode of The Bold and The Beautiful . </p> <p>Police incompetence and corruption is nothing new, but its public exposure is, and each new revelation is oxygen for the vigilante movements. Peter Drake can claim that any policeman who opposes his activities must obviously be corrupt, fearful that a criminal might expose him during a Mapogo beating. Abreda Roberts alleges that Pagad 'has a lot of sensitive information on drugs and it involves police and politicians', and blames the spate of Cape Town bombings on officers trying to frame Pagad. Rashid Staggie accuses the police of using Pagad hit squads as a front to murder gangsters - and so it goes on. Between all the bitterly remembered injustices of the old regime, and the tangled flaws of the new, it doesn't require much imagination for a vigilante outfit to move the moral goal posts until its self- serving violence looks like public piety. </p> <p>But even their most elastic logic cannot explain away one contradiction. If what they do works, then crime in areas where they are active should by now be under control. One Friday in January, a Flying Squad patrol car offered a tour of a typical night's work on the Cape Flats. It began at midnight with a shooting. We pulled up at a squat house surrounded by neighbours in dressing gowns, drawn by the commotion. Inside, a thin young man sat slumped, shirt off, elbows on knees. A woman mopped his head while a man held his jaw up, repeating urgently, over and over, 'Stay awake'. The young man had a bullet wound in his back, and his sunken eyes were hanging in shock and fear. He made no sound, and he was clearly dying. He had gone out for cigarettes earlier and been gunned down by passing members of a rival gang. </p> <p>At a nearby hospital, staff had treated three gunshot wounds and 15 stabbings by 2am. As we arrived, a young man, naked to the waist, was walking in with a knife wound in his back like a pink, wet eye, and the oval pocket of blood slopped with every step. Armed guards patrolled the gates; the door was a metal detector; visitors were locked in the foyer behind bars. A nurse explained that this has become necessary because gangs follow the ambulances here and try to storm the wards to finish their victims off. </p> <p>An hour later, a chaotic gun battle was raging between police and the occupants of a house being raided for drugs. A young man was eventually dragged out and slammed against the bonnet of a patrol vehicle. An officer pounded his face into the bonnet with one hand, and shoved the other hand between his legs, twisting higher and higher until the screaming man was flapping like a fish against the van. Other policemen clustered round kicking him, and a tall, bony officer, taut with fury, handed his rifle to a colleague, took out a pistol and whipped it over and over across the man's head. After two more suspects had been beaten and thrown in a van, the curdling frenzy subsided, and officers stood around and smoked and laughed, hot waves of adrenalin discharging into the cool night breeze. The police had already shot a fourth man in the house and as they escorted the ambulance to hospital, another gun fight broke out. </p> <p>As dawn broke over the hospital car park, the police all remarked on what an unusually quiet night it had been.</p>",

      "bodyText": "W hen Peter Drake appeared on the porch of his farmhouse, smiling through the gloom of an African dusk, it seemed as if there must have been a mistake. The kindly softness of his welcome seemed unlikely to belong to the type of man we had been expecting to meet. He ushered in his visitors, and it was not long before he had offered these strangers some supper and a bed for the night. He wouldn't hear of a hotel, and his wife was quite insistent. 'You must understand,' she confided, 'South Africans are very hospitable people.' Then she checked herself, and paused to reconsider. 'Well,' she corrected herself, 'South African farmers are, anyway.' Peter Drake is a farmer, and his wife, Karen, is a ballet teacher. They live in the lush curl of a mountain pass in the north- eastern tip of South Africa, not all that far, Peter says, 'from Rhode_ I mean, Zimbabwe'. They grow fruit on the family farm and live in a roomy, remote house with their three sweet-natured daughters. The eldest is the local high-school beauty queen, and she drifted in and out throughout the evening, bringing teenage smiles and updates of the cricket on the TV next door. The Drakes lead a quiet life, and that is how they like it. But Peter was glad of the opportunity to speak about their one local difficulty. He began by talking a bit about how he has come to disapprove of apartheid since its abolition, and about his fear that the ANC government is failing to enforce law and order. Politics per se does not really interest him, he confessed, but there is one issue that concerns him a great deal: he is monumentally worried about crime. This formula of views is extremely common among white South Africans, but the tone of his delivery suggested an unusually thoughtful mind, one in the habit of measuring up the morality of an opinion before venturing it. He carried on talking in his easy, level way, and presently remarked that whenever he sees massacres committed in Africa on the television, he is horrified. He asks himself how Africans can butcher their neighbours in cold blood. But then, he continued, he always remembers what his own team of farm hands is capable of, every time he orders them to abduct a local 'criminal', tie him up and whip the living daylights out of him. 'When I see how my committee guys are willing to give a guy a hiding, I see how these black atrocities in Africa get committed. You just wouldn't believe how brutal they are.' He paused, let out a low whistle, and shook his head. 'The black man, he's brutal.' His guys are so brutal, Peter has to stand over them while they administer the beating he has ordered, to make sure they don't go overboard and kill the man. 'I'm like the Nazi Gestapo guy,' he explained. 'I monitor the beatings.' Peter Drake is a middle-aged farmer who thinks of himself as a decent man, but he is also branch leader of a South African organisation called Mapogo-a-Mathamaga. 'We say it isn't a vigilante outfit,' he remarked, 'but that's what it is.' Mapogo was founded late in 1996 by a handful of black businessmen, originally as a local response to a crimewave in their small rural town. Today, its founding president, John Magolego, tours South Africa urging the public to sign up. The meetings he holds are not unlike religious revivalist affairs, and the vigilante action he preaches is straightforwardly candid. 'We don't consider that a criminal has human rights,' Magolego explained. 'He has got no rights of keeping his mouth shut when asked to tell the truth of his crime. If he keeps his mouth shut, we open it, and we don't spare the rod. We believe in corporal punishment. Our punishment,' - the words are trotted out in a happy sing-song - 'is always the sjambok on the buttocks of the criminal.' (The sjambok is a stiff, leather South African whip.) In his crisp suit and gold cufflinks, flanked by bodyguards, Magolego spelt out his organisation's contempt for Western-style justice in South Africa. 'The right to silence? No, no, no, we don't want that. And criminals should not have lawyers - they just help perpetrate crime. If I know you have taken my car and I've seen you driving it, then what the hell do you need a lawyer for? That's my car! And everyone knows that's my car! So the lawyer is just someone to get you off when you are guilty.' The Mapogo solution to crime is altogether more simple. 'The criminal must just be made to lie on the floor and feel the pain.' When Peter Drake heard that Magolego was coming to address his home town last year, he remembers, 'I thought, this is like Father Christmas coming here.' He and other farmers were fed up with local break-ins, and with workers stealing produce and getting into drunken fights. Crime never used to be a problem, and they were unhappy about it, so they ordered their labourers to attend Magolego's meeting. Persuaded by what he heard, Drake promptly ordered every one of his 60 workers to pay up and join Mapogo, or leave his farm. He then selected a committee of eight farmhands - his 'top guys' - and the next time a crime was committed on his farm, Drake's unit swung into action. They caught a man laying a snare, tried him in a bush court in Drake's shed on the spot, and sentenced him to 25 lashes. Drake called the local farmers, who summoned all their workers to witness the inaugural Mapogo flogging. Ever since then, Drake and his team have been busy all over the province, beating up blacks. Every Mapogo member is supposed to be active in solving and punishing fellow members' crimes, but in practice many prefer to call Drake and his team - a responsibility Drake takes seriously, but speaks of lightly, much in the manner of a gardener describing his latest solution to greenfly. Occasionally, Karen would chip in with the odd comment, and smile supportively. 'It's like beating a dog,' she murmured. 'You have to do it quickly, so they learn their lesson.' A Mapogo court case is 'just like a normal court', Drake explained, 'but very condensed. We work swiftly.' When a victim contacts him, he and his team go and fetch the accused straight away, and drive him to a 'forsaken spot' where Drake interrogates him. 'If the guy denies the crime, we say OK, tell us who saw you not doing it. You see, it's a fair trial.' If the suspect still pleads innocence, Drake instructs his committee to beat him. 'Oh, and we wear Balaclavas,' he added, 'that's a must.' After a shortish beating, the perpetrator 'usually admits he did it', and Drake and his team then discuss the appropriate punishment. For smaller crimes, say the stealing of a pen, they would decide to give 15 or 20 lashes, but for a big crime it could be 150 to 200. 'The idea,' Drake explained, 'is if you hammer the small crimes, they don't get bigger. It began in New York, I think. It's called zero tolerance.' The windows of the Drakes' house were heavily barred, and on the sideboard was a rifle, a bullet-proof vest and a two-way radio which connects the household with a chain of other white farms along the valley, so that assistance can be summoned quickly in an emergency. As a demonstration, Peter broadcast a request for responses, and a crackle of taut, pseudo-military barks came echoing back through the night - Karen smiled tightly as she counted them off on her fingers. These are the voices of frightened people who complain about what they consider the necessity of having to live under such conditions. Although they wouldn't say they still supported apartheid, they firmly believe that the new democracy is to blame. 'I know the black man through and through,' Drake repeated several times. 'I understand him, and democracy undermines the black man's historical bloodlines and traditions - what he understands is power and respect. You can't tell me you can teach an illiterate individual first-world principles, and I'd say 80 per cent of this country is illiterate. It's ruthless, the beating, but that's how these chaps grow up. I don't like what happens, but it has to happen; it's a system devised by the black man, for the black man - and it works. The blacks are like children: you have to be harsh and hard.

Peter Drake interprets any police action against members as 'harassment', and is thoroughly indignant. 'The thing that shocks me,' he reflected, 'is that I'm degraded to the level where I actually have to go out and lynch these people. I don't want to have to degrade myself like that. It's the government's job.' This is a striking view of the job of government, but perhaps not as striking as the scale of its popularity. Mapogo now has approximately 60,000 members, the majority black, making it South Africa's largest vigilante organisation, but by no means its only one. Since apartheid was dismantled, recorded levels of every category of crime have risen dramatically, while the number of prosecutions and convictions has been steadily falling.

Private guards now outnumber police officers in South Africa by 4.5 to one, and have been to known to stray outside the law in their line of duty. In the townships, people have learnt to rely on a more informal form of vigilante justice. 'The taxi guys are very powerful,' explained one young man who had recently used their services to recover stolen property. 'They're the people who don't give a shit.' The mini-bus taxi routes between the townships and Cape Town are traditionally lucrative, and rival operators have fought spectacularly bloody battles for control. The drivers acquired a fearful reputation as de facto elders - and so have come to function in some communities as the arbiters of local justice. This is an example of taxi vigilantism in action. A teenage girl on the Cape Flats was gang raped last year, and her family took her to the local taxi people. The young culprits she named were swiftly rounded up, and a makeshift kangaroo court followed, where the girl identified the rapists. The youths, barely more than boys, were stripped naked, tied up, and the girl was handed a sjambok and urged to give them a whipping. A TV crew filmed the whole affair, and harrowing footage of the boys screaming and bleeding caused a minor stir in liberal circles when it was broadcast. But taxi vigilantism has been broadly eclipsed by more dramatic recent developments in Cape Town. An organisation calling itself Pagad - People Against Gangsters and Drugs - emerged in the city in 1996, and in due course it gave a public demonstration of its preferred method of dealing with crime. The media were invited to a Pagad rally, which began in a mosque with an address to a crowd of 4,000, and the following scenes were filmed. 'The legal process has collapsed!' screamed the speaker. 'There is nothing the police can do about the gangsters. Enough is enough!' A chant broke out, led by men in masks: 'Are the drug merchants and the gangsters your enemies? Yes! Are they the enemies of the community? Yes! So what must we do? Kill them!' The crowd poured out of the mosque into a convoy of vehicles, and descended upon the home of Rashaad Staggie, then leader of the Hard Livings. In full view of a massive police deployment, the mob swarmed around the house - Staggie appeared, and a masked man shot him through the head. Staggie fell to the ground pouring with blood, and an ambulance man rushed to help him, but another masked man got there first, doused Staggie in petrol, and set him on fire. As Staggie stumbled and lurched to his feet, wrapped in flames, the crowd bayed: 'God is great! God is great! While he lay dying on the pavement, 75 more bullets entered his body, and men swarmed around the charred corpse, kicking and beating his head. A helpless medical crew cowered in their ambulance, as the mob hammered on the windows screaming: 'Fuck off or we shoot you, too! Fuck off or you die!' Staggie's televised killing was followed by the murder of more than 30 other senior gang leaders in drive-by shootings. The government took fright and made attempts to contain the group's violence, at which point the state itself appeared to become its new target, and Pagad's anti-gangster statements assumed an Islamic fundamentalist tone. A detective assigned to investigate the organisation was assasinated, and a series of bombs exploded across the city through the course of last year; a young British tourist lost her foot in one blast and the Foreign Office declared the city unsafe for tourists before Christmas. On Christmas Eve, a policewoman lost her leg in a booby-trap blast, and Cape Town passed into the new millennium under heavy police and army patrol. In January, a court was bombed on the day that two Pagad members were appearing. More than 50 members are now awaiting trial on charges of murder, extortion and related offences, and police chiefs speak privately of urban war. Undeterred, Pagad continues to speak publicly of victory. 'We will eradicate gangsterism and drugs,' a Pagad spokeswoman stated calmly, 'by all means necessary.' We met at Cape Town magistrate's court following a bail hearing for Pagad's leader, who had just been arrested and charged with the murder of Staggie, and she talked with a crisp, cool lucidity. 'Through the years, there have been many attempts to deal with the gangsters. It didn't work. Neighbourhood watches, police forums - it was not enough. A clear message had to be given to the gangsters. We are not interested in peace deals and negotiations, we are interested in eradication. We want to get rid of gangs - turn them off. And it is working.' While she was speaking, a crowd of Pagad supporters had gathered outside the court, and sturdy Muslim grandmothers in headscarves, pounding fists in the air, could be heard chanting over and over: 'One gangster, one bullet!' Two questions present themselves in the face of scenes such as these. How was crime in South Africa allowed to reach levels that would provoke grandmothers to incite murder, and middle-class family men to don Balaclavas and whip their own workers? And why do these people, decent and law-abiding by their own estimation, imagine they have the right to terrorise a newly legitimised South Africa in the name of justice? The new government is commonly blamed on both counts, for being too incompetent to keep order - but the causes are more complex than that. A culture of crime and a spirit of vigilantism are considerably older than democracy in South Africa. It is a political truth that the transition from any police state to democracy is always characterised by a weakening of law-enforcement structures. Uncertainty among the police about their changing future - and in some cases outright resistance - created enviable openings for criminals in South Africa, just as it has in the former Soviet Union. Police are also taking some time to learn the new skills of detection and investigation they need to combat crime, now that they are no longer able to rely on their old method of extracting 'confessions'. But apartheid did more than merely create a law- enforcement vacuum when it died: it spent its last years deliberately nurturing the very gangs who are now responsible for the crimewave in South Africa. The origins of the modern Cape Town gangs provide the best illustration of this. They date back to the late 60s, when the coloured population of the city was forcibly removed and dumped in townships out on a bleak sheet of land to the east, persecuted by wind and dust, known as the Cape Flats. Gangs formed quickly in the shattered communities, but the police state was then efficient at putting their leaders in prison. When political unrest flared in the 80s, however, the police released these leaders and paid them to terrorise anti-apartheid activists in the townships. It was a cosy relationship in which gangsters bought their freedom with acts of violence on behalf of apartheid, and police duly turned a blind eye to their other criminal activities. When the apartheid state began to crumble, Cape Flats gangs were already in a strong position to exploit the disarray - and they believed they had a notional justification for their crimes. 'The political agreement chiselled out by the parties included the idea of amnesty for political offences,' explained Irvine Kinnes, who grew on the Cape Flats, and recently completed an MA on the gangs. 'To the gang members, this represented a freedom to commit crime and get away with it_ They didn't distinguish between their own crimes and those of the liberation movement - if political leaders were \"getting away\" with their crimes, why couldn't they?' It wasn't long before the gangs had progressed from street crime to racketeering, gun running and international drug smuggling. If democracy inherited a gang problem, it has also inherited a long history of South Africans taking the law into their own hands. Rural black communities were not famous for being well served by effective policing, and so it was village elders who would administer justice. Migrant workers imported this tradition to the townships, communities also infamously ill-served by the state's police. White rural settlers, too, have traditionally considered themselves entitled to punish transgressions on their land without recourse to law, and Afrikaner animosity towards British rule was fuelled by irritation at the colonial habit of believing courts of law were the proper place to resolve disagreements. Vigilantism thrives when the link between state and justice has been so corroded that any given group can indulge its often illegal desires - be it drug smuggling, racist violence or Islamic fundamentalism - and still present itself as a champion of justice. This corrosion has eaten so deeply into South Africa that even the gangs themselves are now affecting a public re-invention of themselves as the anti-crime guardians of their communities. They have formed a political movement called Core, purporting to signify their commitment to peace, and some 3,000 Cape Flats gangsters marched on parliament under its banner. The leader of the Hard Livings, Rashaad Staggie's brother Rashid, has recently converted to Christianity, turned his old shebeen into a church, and come up with a theory that gangsters themselves are 'new victims of apartheid' - a view that has been endorsed by some prominent church leaders. In this Alice in Wonderland analysis, the new government is to blame for the rise in crime, because it curtailed police powers and abol ished the death penalty. If criminals can now get away with murder, then nobody is safe - and so, reason the gangs, it falls to them to administer justice and keep the peace. 'It's better like this,' explained Gansie Uys, while opening a bottle of beer with a pistol. He prefers to call himself a community leader, not a gangster. 'We help the people, we protect them. The community likes us.' There is an element of awful truth in this. Police corruption is so endemic, and incompetence so legendary, that many South Africans do regard local gangsters as their best hope of protection. One in four officers in Johannesburg was under investigation for a criminal offence in 1996. Such statistics are well known, and reports of negligence circulate daily. In January, for example, a Cape Town politician phoned a township police station to report a crime, but after 20 minutes nobody had answered the phone. When she gave up and drove to the station, she found lengthy queues waiting at the counter, several phones ringing - and the staff gathered around a TV, engrossed in an episode of The Bold and The Beautiful . Police incompetence and corruption is nothing new, but its public exposure is, and each new revelation is oxygen for the vigilante movements. Peter Drake can claim that any policeman who opposes his activities must obviously be corrupt, fearful that a criminal might expose him during a Mapogo beating. Abreda Roberts alleges that Pagad 'has a lot of sensitive information on drugs and it involves police and politicians', and blames the spate of Cape Town bombings on officers trying to frame Pagad. Rashid Staggie accuses the police of using Pagad hit squads as a front to murder gangsters - and so it goes on. Between all the bitterly remembered injustices of the old regime, and the tangled flaws of the new, it doesn't require much imagination for a vigilante outfit to move the moral goal posts until its self- serving violence looks like public piety. But even their most elastic logic cannot explain away one contradiction. If what they do works, then crime in areas where they are active should by now be under control. One Friday in January, a Flying Squad patrol car offered a tour of a typical night's work on the Cape Flats. It began at midnight with a shooting. We pulled up at a squat house surrounded by neighbours in dressing gowns, drawn by the commotion. Inside, a thin young man sat slumped, shirt off, elbows on knees. A woman mopped his head while a man held his jaw up, repeating urgently, over and over, 'Stay awake'. The young man had a bullet wound in his back, and his sunken eyes were hanging in shock and fear. He made no sound, and he was clearly dying. He had gone out for cigarettes earlier and been gunned down by passing members of a rival gang. At a nearby hospital, staff had treated three gunshot wounds and 15 stabbings by 2am. As we arrived, a young man, naked to the waist, was walking in with a knife wound in his back like a pink, wet eye, and the oval pocket of blood slopped with every step. Armed guards patrolled the gates; the door was a metal detector; visitors were locked in the foyer behind bars. A nurse explained that this has become necessary because gangs follow the ambulances here and try to storm the wards to finish their victims off. An hour later, a chaotic gun battle was raging between police and the occupants of a house being raided for drugs. A young man was eventually dragged out and slammed against the bonnet of a patrol vehicle. An officer pounded his face into the bonnet with one hand, and shoved the other hand between his legs, twisting higher and higher until the screaming man was flapping like a fish against the van. Other policemen clustered round kicking him, and a tall, bony officer, taut with fury, handed his rifle to a colleague, took out a pistol and whipped it over and over across the man's head. After two more suspects had been beaten and thrown in a van, the curdling frenzy subsided, and officers stood around and smoked and laughed, hot waves of adrenalin discharging into the cool night breeze. The police had already shot a fourth man in the house and as they escorted the ambulance to hospital, another gun fight broke out. As dawn broke over the hospital car park, the police all remarked on what an unusually quiet night it had been.",

      "body": "<p>I would have thought no one could possibly dislike Richard Billingham's work, but I was wrong. When I blithely told an art-critic friend that I was writing about Richard Billingham, he exploded, 'His work isn't ART!' Oh really, what is it then? Are we back to saying that photography can't be art? Unfortunately my friend was too incoherent with rage to make much sense, but the word naive came up a lot, and so did sensationalist. Since we were talking about the Sensation exhibition at the time, the latter accusation seemed particularly bizarre - I would say that Billingham's photographs were far less sensationalist than most of the stuff in the exhibition - if they provoked a shock among RA visitors, it was only because RA visitors tend to lead sheltered lives. </p> <p>But naive is more problematic, and this is perhaps why Billingham has never been wholly accepted into the Britart fold. Obviously we know - because his photographs tell us so -that he comes from a deprived, dysfunctional family in a Birmingham towerblock. But does that make him a naive artist? I mean, it's not as if he's some illiterate aboriginal found wandering in the desert with a paintstick in his hands. He went to art school, he has a degree in fine arts. He knows exactly what he is doing in his work - in fact, according to Jonathan Watkins, director of the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham, he is exceptionally decisive and particular about the details of hanging and installation and catalogue design. </p> <p>And yet, as a person, he seems_ naive is not quite the word, but innocent maybe or unworldly, a sort of Candide or Forrest Gump who hasn't yet got used to the fancy ways of the big bad world. He is 29, but I can hear myself on the tape sometimes addressing him like a child, 'Do you know what you want to eat, Richard? Shall I order something for you from the menu?' We were in Birmingham's Caf\u00e9 Rouge and he seemed never to have seen a menu before - but then he quite deftly ordered two bottles of wine and drank most of them, as well as smoking all my cigarettes. </p> <p>Sometimes he seems to play up his naivety, saying he never knew what an art dealer was till he signed with one, or that he never knew foreign galleries would pay for you to fly out to hang exhibitions and put you up in hotels. He had never stayed in a hotel before, and says he still hasn't seen inside a middle-class home. But then he walks around the Ikon Gallery as if he owns it, and mentions that he enjoyed the Tate opening and a recent trip to Paris to design a book with agn\u00e8s b. This switch from naivety to sophistication, insecurity to authority, goes on constantly and is always catching me on the wrong foot. When I wittered on about his childhood poverty, he snapped, 'I think of poverty as being people from Ethiopia not having nothing to eat - That's poverty.' The class gulf yawned. </p> <p>He wouldn't take me to see his parents - he said they were off limits to journalists because 'You can't parade them around like poodles!' - but he did take our photographer, Neil Drabble. Neil said the flat was quite ordinary, but Billingham's parents were good fun, and there was lots of laughter - as indeed there is in Billingham's photographs. But Billingham wouldn't take either Neil or me to his own home in nearby Stourbridge, which makes one wonder what terrible secrets it contains. Knicker blinds? Mug trees? He describes it as 'a bit bland, actually'. </p> <p>Anyway, however naive he might or might not be as a person, that doesn't mean he's a naive artist. But that seems to be the suspicion among some critics - that he's someone who just got lucky by pointing his camera at a God-given subject, his own family. And of course his family, first shown in his book, Ray's a Laugh, and then in the Sensation exhibition, is enthralling - poor drunken Ray with his eternal bottles of home-brew, fleshy Liz with her rotting teeth and lavish tattoos, Jason the teenager, the cats, the dogs, the hamster, the serried ranks of knick-knacks on the sideboards, the miniature Venetian masks on the wall, the jigsaws, the telly, the squalor in the kitchen. All such a refreshing change from the normal grainy photojournalistic representation of towerblock life which invariably features someone sitting on the edge of an unmade bed looking doleful to camera, with the implicit message: 'This is meant to shock you out of your complacency. Don't you care ?' Nah, I always think, flicking the page, don't care for toffee - but I care passionately about the Billinghams, precisely because they are not presented as social problems but as riotously colourful individuals. </p> <p>Still, the critics ask: can Billingham do any more than that? Is he just a one-hit wonder, or can he be equally interesting when photographing something other than his family? Actually, I think even this question is unfair. We don't ask whether Rachel Whiteread can do more than make casts of things, or whether Jenny Saville can paint more than big nudes. We normally accept that artists have a chosen subject area and technique, but somehow Billingham has to 'prove himself' by doing something completely different. I don't see why, frankly - but Billingham does. He explains: 'When I first showed my family pictures, I realised that a lot of people liked them just because they saw the surface, and they didn't see the beauty underneath. And as soon I started showing the family photographs, I stopped taking them, because it was sort of over. If I was to start taking them with a view to exhibiting them, then that wouldn't be a good motive because I wouldn't be doing it out of curiosity any more. And I thought if I could strip all the subject away, and just photograph nothing - so they're not an index of the subject matter but just of how they were taken - then that would show that they are good photographs, and people would like them for the right reasons.' </p> <p>Hence his new show at the Ikon Gallery. It wasn't installed when I met him, but he showed me the videos and photographs that will make up the exhibition. The videos were shot in 1998 and 1999 and still relate to his family - there is one of his mother smoking, one of his father lying in bed, one of a friend smoking a cigarette 'backwards' and a very disturbing one called Playstation , of fingers frantically tapping at a computer console. 'It's my brother coming down off speed and playing the PlayStation madly - he'll do this for something like 30 hours nonstop. Originally I was going to film his face and the computer screen, but all the expression was in the fingers.' It is a far more frightening picture of addiction than his father with his home-brew. </p> <p>The exhibition also includes some of the first photographs he ever took - black-and-white portraits of his uncles and his father. These are easy to like. But then there are his urban landscapes, which are much more difficult. He says he took literally thousands of them, between 1992 and 1997, and has chosen just 15 for the show. They are dull-coloured photographs of drab urban spaces, patches of wasteland, corners of towerblocks, all taken round Cradley Heath, where he grew up. There are no people in them, and no obvious points of interest. The Ikon catalogue talks about a Proustian search for lost time, but Billingham says only: 'My friend described them as the sort of photographs you would take when you were starting a roll of film, and I thought that was a good description.' I must admit, I find them baffling. Obviously these places mean something to him , but what? </p> <p>Billingham says, 'Well, it's like something is about to happen. It's like a stage set for something about to happen.' To me, they all seem laden with menace, the sort of places that scream 'mugger lurking', or 'paedophile about to pounce', but perhaps that says more about me than it does about Billingham. He says they're just places he used to pass on the way to school or to his grandparents', but he didn't want to make them look nostalgic. 'Maybe they're about picture-making more than anything else.' </p> <p>Maybe they are - but they're still terribly unsettling. So is Billingham himself - I've never felt so completely unhinged by an interviewee. He is perfectly friendly, eager to talk, but it is as if we are both equipped with foreign phrasebooks where the questions and answers don't match up. I think a possible explanation is that he is quite new to this communicating lark - he was a loner for much of his childhood and didn't really feel that he fitted in anywhere till he arrived in the art world. And, he explains, 'I am quite self-contained. I do feel a lot, but I don't show a lot. I suppose when I was growing up and being a bit more neglected than the other kids socially - well, you can see how it is - so you learn not to show it so much. But I'm not, like, walled up or anything.' </p> <p>He says his upbringing was not that bad - 'The thing is, I was never encouraged, but I was never dis couraged either, so I was left to my own devices.' He thinks he was 'normal' when he was small but then somehow retreated into himself when he was about 11. He didn't make any friends at school and was always the last to be chosen when they were picking sides for football. Nor did he have any success with girls - he didn't have a girlfriend till he was 22. 'Because I was so into my books and into my artwork, maybe I was n't interested. And I think when I was living on the estate, when I was a teenager, maybe I was quite angry or something, and there was nobody on the estate that I would like.' </p> <p>Obviously, he was neglected as a child, and his younger brother Jason was taken into care at the age of 10. But Richard by then was 17 and the social worker who came round decided that he was alright - his room was well lit and full of books. And he was alright in a way - he was getting on with his art. He was always 'the best drawer' at school and managed to get himself on to an art foundation course at the local Bourneville College. But while he was there, his mother left home and went to live in a neighbouring towerblock and his father just drank himself into a stupor. 'I think my dad drank a lot in the hope that she would see him in such a state that she would feel sorry and come back. But it didn't work!' This was the period commemorated in one of his most haunting photographs of his father getting up from bed staring at a pile of sliced bread on the bedside table. It was one of the first colour photographs Richard took and is still one of his favourites. </p> <p>For 18 months, his father 'just stopped in his room and drank and didn't eat nothing, so I just left this bread in there, but he still didn't eat it.' Every day, when he came home from college, he wondered whether he'd find his father dead or alive. I said, conventionally, that that must have been a terrible period, but Billingham said, 'Well, when I think back, I've only got happy memories of it, to be honest. Because I was free and doing my work, and in myself I was happy.' Since his mother was away, his brother in care, and his father never emerged from his room, Billingham had the flat pretty much to himself. Then he went off to university and soon afterwards his parents got together again. </p> <p>He went to the University of Sunderland but not by choice - all of the six art schools he chose rejected him - and he talks of it disdainfully as 'a drop-out course'. But he worked hard and remained very focused. At this stage, he still thought of himself as a painter who was only taking photographs as source material to use for paintings. That is why he never cared about his equipment - he used an ordinary instamatic with built-in flash, or even a disposable camera, and sometimes bought film past its sell by date. But one day it dawned on him that his photographs had more life than his paintings. 'When I started, I was just doing photographs to paint from, and that's why they look so set up. But occasionally I'd do a photograph that wasn't set up, and when I would see it back from the chemist it would be a bit more of a shock or something - I could see my dad in a different light. And then I started taking the photographs more and more, just out of my own curiosity.' </p> <p>His parents got so used to him taking photographs they didn't even notice, which is why they are so un-selfconscious. He would just be sitting round the flat and then something would happen - his father would fall over or send the cat flying through the air - and he would snap it. He says, 'The best photographs are the ones where I just lift the camera and snap - the less I think about it, the more spontaneous it is.' Interestingly, he says that the worst photograph is one of his parents both eating in front of the telly, because 'it looks like any hack photographer could have come in and taken this photograph - it doesn't show you anything about the relationship I have with them. I wish I'd never put it in the book. But it's so well known now I just have to live with it.' </p> <p>Eventually, Billingham started showing the photographs to friends and tutors at the University of Sunderland. He didn't say at first that they were of his own family, though later he did. While he was still a student, in 1994, some of his photographs were included in an exhibition at the Barbican called Who's Looking at The Family? And he was invited to the opening, but it was not a happy experience. 'I was introduced to other photographers, but they weren't artists. And I was new to all this, so when I was introduced to people and they said, \"What do you do?\", I said, \"There's some of my work over there, do you want to have a look at it?\" - and they'd sort of edge away. It was so rude, but I was very young then; I wasn't dressed right or anything. But I wish people weren't like that - they should just accept you, you know. I mean, they saw the work, but nobody cared about it because I wasn't anybody at the time.' </p> <p>Then he finished university and came back to Birmingham and worked as a shelf-stacker in KwikSave. He was a hard worker and very fit, so he was always being offered places on management-trainee schemes, but he preferred to keep stacking because it left his mind free to think about art. He never called himself an artist because 'I would have thought it pretentious, if I wasn't having shows. I thought of myself as one, but on the estate, if I'd called myself an artist, they would have thought I was mad. Now I can call myself an artist because that's how I make my living.' </p> <p>For two years after university, he stacked shelves and got on with his own work. Then one of his Sunderland tutors suggested he should do a book, and got a publisher to commission it. This was Ray's a Laugh , the collection of his family photographs, published by Scalo of Zurich in April 1996. For once, the expression 'overnight success' seems accurate. One day he was a shelf-stacker in KwikSave, the next he was being signed up by art dealer Anthony Reynolds and wooed by art galleries all round the world. He was shown in MOMA in New York and had one-man shows in Los Angeles, Paris, Milan, Frankfurt, Brussels and Rome; Charles Saatchi bought his work and included it in Sensation; Artangel commissioned him to make a film, Fishtank , which was shown on BBC2, and in 1997 he won the Citibank Photography Prize. </p> <p>It was a novel experience for him to find himself in demand everywhere, to have people falling over themselves to meet him. Up till then he'd passed through life almost unnoticed. 'I was very introverted, you see, and I have to admit I didn't let on things. I was self-contained, a lot more so than now. But when I did the book, this was the first time other people could see what was inside me and all of a sudden they wanted to get to know more, and want my opinion. It was funny - like, I had no attention before and now I've got a lot of attention.' </p> <p>His life now is a strange mixture of the gritty and the glitzy. He bought himself a \u00a377,000 house in Stourbridge, one of the Black Country suburbs of Birmingham, a few years ago and has spent some time doing it up, but now he wants to rent a studio so he can go out to work in the morning and come back at night, more like a real job. He makes about \u00a340,000 to \u00a350,000 a year, which he says is 'enough to live on, but not enough to travel about and stay in hotels. But I feel I'm rich because I don't have to work for a living.' </p> <p>He wants to stay in Birmingham because he finds it easier to work there, and also, of course, cheaper. But he loves coming to London for the day, for a quick fix of the art world. 'People talk about the art world being shallow and everything, but I really like it.' What he misses in Birmingham is the company of other artists. He has one good local friend who was a fellow student at Sunderland, whom he sees about once a week, and he goes to London one day a week. 'These things are just enough to keep me not being lonely, but I do still feel alienated because there's no one I can talk to.' </p> <p>He lives a few miles from his parents and visits them often. He took them to one of his first shows, in Bradford in 1996, and they were quite intrigued to see pictures of themselves on the walls, 'but they were more interested in staying in the hotel and getting free meals, to be honest'. He says it's diffi cult to take them anywhere because 'they're not very good at balance and walking', but he did take them to Brighton a couple of times. Mainly, though, they just sit at home and smoke and watch telly - he says the flat has bookshelves all round like a library, but they're full of videos, not books. Ray has cut down on his drinking, simply because he falls over if he drinks too much. Richard has managed to get them increased benefits and disability allowance, and he has bought them a microwave and a washing machine, but he says there's no point in giving them cash because they'd just leave the money lying around till someone nicked it. </p> <p>I asked whether he'd tried to 'save' his brother Jason, and he seemed offended by the question, but then said yes, actually he had - he tried to get him to do A levels and persuaded him to move back from his foster parents, but it didn't work out: 'He had had no freedom [in care] and then he had all this freedom which he couldn't handle and he got involved with the kids on the estate and the first thing he did was get a girl pregnant!' </p> <p>Billingham will not make the same mistake. He values his hard-earned freedom, and plans to keep it. He had a girlfriend, a social worker in Brighton, but she wanted to settle down and have a family and he felt he was too young. 'It's only in the last three years I've had my freedom to do my work properly, and there are still things I want to do.' But he says he will have a family one day - 'I wouldn't want to argue, though. People say in arguments truths come out, which is correct, but you don't have to communicate by arguing, do you? I'm scared of arguing!' </p> <p>So what will he do next? The Ikon exhibition is a good roundup of all his work so far, but it doesn't really offer any clues or pointers to the future. However, Billingham says he has been doing lots of sketches and drawings, which he hopes to use as the basis for paintings when he has more time. 'I try to work every day but it's difficult to, because there's so many other things, but Francis Bacon said what seems like inspiration comes from regular work - and I'm much better if I can work regularly. But I don't always get the chance - I mean, there's a meeting about catalogue design, or putting the rubbish out for the binmen.' It is typical of him to give binmen and catalogues the same importance. Perhaps this is what people mean by his 'naivety' - his attachment to the real world, which counts as oddity in the art world. It's a very valuable oddity, I believe.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I would have thought no one could possibly dislike Richard Billingham's work, but I was wrong. When I blithely told an art-critic friend that I was writing about Richard Billingham, he exploded, 'His work isn't ART!' Oh really, what is it then? Are we back to saying that photography can't be art? Unfortunately my friend was too incoherent with rage to make much sense, but the word naive came up a lot, and so did sensationalist. Since we were talking about the Sensation exhibition at the time, the latter accusation seemed particularly bizarre - I would say that Billingham's photographs were far less sensationalist than most of the stuff in the exhibition - if they provoked a shock among RA visitors, it was only because RA visitors tend to lead sheltered lives. But naive is more problematic, and this is perhaps why Billingham has never been wholly accepted into the Britart fold. Obviously we know - because his photographs tell us so -that he comes from a deprived, dysfunctional family in a Birmingham towerblock. But does that make him a naive artist? I mean, it's not as if he's some illiterate aboriginal found wandering in the desert with a paintstick in his hands. He went to art school, he has a degree in fine arts. He knows exactly what he is doing in his work - in fact, according to Jonathan Watkins, director of the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham, he is exceptionally decisive and particular about the details of hanging and installation and catalogue design. And yet, as a person, he seems_ naive is not quite the word, but innocent maybe or unworldly, a sort of Candide or Forrest Gump who hasn't yet got used to the fancy ways of the big bad world. He is 29, but I can hear myself on the tape sometimes addressing him like a child, 'Do you know what you want to eat, Richard? Shall I order something for you from the menu?' We were in Birmingham's Caf\u00e9 Rouge and he seemed never to have seen a menu before - but then he quite deftly ordered two bottles of wine and drank most of them, as well as smoking all my cigarettes. Sometimes he seems to play up his naivety, saying he never knew what an art dealer was till he signed with one, or that he never knew foreign galleries would pay for you to fly out to hang exhibitions and put you up in hotels. He had never stayed in a hotel before, and says he still hasn't seen inside a middle-class home. But then he walks around the Ikon Gallery as if he owns it, and mentions that he enjoyed the Tate opening and a recent trip to Paris to design a book with agn\u00e8s b. This switch from naivety to sophistication, insecurity to authority, goes on constantly and is always catching me on the wrong foot. When I wittered on about his childhood poverty, he snapped, 'I think of poverty as being people from Ethiopia not having nothing to eat - That's poverty.' The class gulf yawned. He wouldn't take me to see his parents - he said they were off limits to journalists because 'You can't parade them around like poodles!' - but he did take our photographer, Neil Drabble. Neil said the flat was quite ordinary, but Billingham's parents were good fun, and there was lots of laughter - as indeed there is in Billingham's photographs. But Billingham wouldn't take either Neil or me to his own home in nearby Stourbridge, which makes one wonder what terrible secrets it contains. Knicker blinds? Mug trees? He describes it as 'a bit bland, actually'. Anyway, however naive he might or might not be as a person, that doesn't mean he's a naive artist. But that seems to be the suspicion among some critics - that he's someone who just got lucky by pointing his camera at a God-given subject, his own family. And of course his family, first shown in his book, Ray's a Laugh, and then in the Sensation exhibition, is enthralling - poor drunken Ray with his eternal bottles of home-brew, fleshy Liz with her rotting teeth and lavish tattoos, Jason the teenager, the cats, the dogs, the hamster, the serried ranks of knick-knacks on the sideboards, the miniature Venetian masks on the wall, the jigsaws, the telly, the squalor in the kitchen. All such a refreshing change from the normal grainy photojournalistic representation of towerblock life which invariably features someone sitting on the edge of an unmade bed looking doleful to camera, with the implicit message: 'This is meant to shock you out of your complacency. Don't you care ?' Nah, I always think, flicking the page, don't care for toffee - but I care passionately about the Billinghams, precisely because they are not presented as social problems but as riotously colourful individuals. Still, the critics ask: can Billingham do any more than that? Is he just a one-hit wonder, or can he be equally interesting when photographing something other than his family? Actually, I think even this question is unfair. We don't ask whether Rachel Whiteread can do more than make casts of things, or whether Jenny Saville can paint more than big nudes. We normally accept that artists have a chosen subject area and technique, but somehow Billingham has to 'prove himself' by doing something completely different. I don't see why, frankly - but Billingham does. He explains: 'When I first showed my family pictures, I realised that a lot of people liked them just because they saw the surface, and they didn't see the beauty underneath. And as soon I started showing the family photographs, I stopped taking them, because it was sort of over. If I was to start taking them with a view to exhibiting them, then that wouldn't be a good motive because I wouldn't be doing it out of curiosity any more. And I thought if I could strip all the subject away, and just photograph nothing - so they're not an index of the subject matter but just of how they were taken - then that would show that they are good photographs, and people would like them for the right reasons.' Hence his new show at the Ikon Gallery. It wasn't installed when I met him, but he showed me the videos and photographs that will make up the exhibition. The videos were shot in 1998 and 1999 and still relate to his family - there is one of his mother smoking, one of his father lying in bed, one of a friend smoking a cigarette 'backwards' and a very disturbing one called Playstation , of fingers frantically tapping at a computer console. 'It's my brother coming down off speed and playing the PlayStation madly - he'll do this for something like 30 hours nonstop. Originally I was going to film his face and the computer screen, but all the expression was in the fingers.' It is a far more frightening picture of addiction than his father with his home-brew. The exhibition also includes some of the first photographs he ever took - black-and-white portraits of his uncles and his father. These are easy to like. But then there are his urban landscapes, which are much more difficult. He says he took literally thousands of them, between 1992 and 1997, and has chosen just 15 for the show. They are dull-coloured photographs of drab urban spaces, patches of wasteland, corners of towerblocks, all taken round Cradley Heath, where he grew up. There are no people in them, and no obvious points of interest. The Ikon catalogue talks about a Proustian search for lost time, but Billingham says only: 'My friend described them as the sort of photographs you would take when you were starting a roll of film, and I thought that was a good description.' I must admit, I find them baffling. Obviously these places mean something to him , but what? Billingham says, 'Well, it's like something is about to happen. It's like a stage set for something about to happen.' To me, they all seem laden with menace, the sort of places that scream 'mugger lurking', or 'paedophile about to pounce', but perhaps that says more about me than it does about Billingham. He says they're just places he used to pass on the way to school or to his grandparents', but he didn't want to make them look nostalgic. 'Maybe they're about picture-making more than anything else.' Maybe they are - but they're still terribly unsettling. So is Billingham himself - I've never felt so completely unhinged by an interviewee. He is perfectly friendly, eager to talk, but it is as if we are both equipped with foreign phrasebooks where the questions and answers don't match up. I think a possible explanation is that he is quite new to this communicating lark - he was a loner for much of his childhood and didn't really feel that he fitted in anywhere till he arrived in the art world. And, he explains, 'I am quite self-contained. I do feel a lot, but I don't show a lot. I suppose when I was growing up and being a bit more neglected than the other kids socially - well, you can see how it is - so you learn not to show it so much. But I'm not, like, walled up or anything.' He says his upbringing was not that bad - 'The thing is, I was never encouraged, but I was never dis couraged either, so I was left to my own devices.' He thinks he was 'normal' when he was small but then somehow retreated into himself when he was about 11. He didn't make any friends at school and was always the last to be chosen when they were picking sides for football. Nor did he have any success with girls - he didn't have a girlfriend till he was 22. 'Because I was so into my books and into my artwork, maybe I was n't interested. And I think when I was living on the estate, when I was a teenager, maybe I was quite angry or something, and there was nobody on the estate that I would like.' Obviously, he was neglected as a child, and his younger brother Jason was taken into care at the age of 10. But Richard by then was 17 and the social worker who came round decided that he was alright - his room was well lit and full of books. And he was alright in a way - he was getting on with his art. He was always 'the best drawer' at school and managed to get himself on to an art foundation course at the local Bourneville College. But while he was there, his mother left home and went to live in a neighbouring towerblock and his father just drank himself into a stupor. 'I think my dad drank a lot in the hope that she would see him in such a state that she would feel sorry and come back. But it didn't work!' This was the period commemorated in one of his most haunting photographs of his father getting up from bed staring at a pile of sliced bread on the bedside table. It was one of the first colour photographs Richard took and is still one of his favourites. For 18 months, his father 'just stopped in his room and drank and didn't eat nothing, so I just left this bread in there, but he still didn't eat it.' Every day, when he came home from college, he wondered whether he'd find his father dead or alive. I said, conventionally, that that must have been a terrible period, but Billingham said, 'Well, when I think back, I've only got happy memories of it, to be honest. Because I was free and doing my work, and in myself I was happy.' Since his mother was away, his brother in care, and his father never emerged from his room, Billingham had the flat pretty much to himself. Then he went off to university and soon afterwards his parents got together again. He went to the University of Sunderland but not by choice - all of the six art schools he chose rejected him - and he talks of it disdainfully as 'a drop-out course'.

      "trailText": "<p>One terrible evening last year, my eight-year-old son's foreskin got stuck back at bathtime</p>",
      "byline": "Sophie Radice",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>One terrible evening last year, my eight-year-old son's foreskin got stuck back at bathtime when he was routinely cleaning himself. Within minutes, it had alarmingly ballooned behind a tight red ring of swollen skin and he was screaming with pain. My husband was still at work and I suddenly felt desperately inadequate. What should I do? Perhaps there was a knack to this? Was this something that happened to boys that I didn't know about? </p> <p>I phoned my GP, who told me that this was an emergency and to get to hospital immediately. My son then had to endure an hour of agony which overcame his extreme embarrassment at having to hold an ice-pack on his genitals while dozens of medical staff came in to our cubicle and gave their opinion. When that failed to bring down the swelling, he was given morphine, followed by gas and air, while a consultant tried to manipulate his foreskin back into its usual position. Despite being told that we were very lucky that the 'foreskin expert' just happened to be in the hospital and this consultant had 'never encountered one that he could not get back', in the end my son was put under general anaesthetic to drain the fluid by a small incision. I was told that he had a bad attack of balanitis - inflammation of the foreskin - which is why he was complaining of having a sore willy. When he tried to clean it in the bath by pulling back his foreskin, paraphimosis occurred. This is when the retracted circle of foreskin becomes tight and swollen, and then fluid builds up behind the tight ring of skin. </p> <p>Before he went into the operating theatre I was told that 'he would certainly have to be circumcised at some point and did I want it done now so he would not need another operation?' Even though I was warned that the swelling would make it slightly more tricky, my immediate response was: 'Yes, of course.' I should explain that there is a history of tight foreskins in my family, with one case of circumcision in late childhood. More importantly, I never wanted my son to have to endure this kind of agony again. The consultant added, 'If you had seen as many old men with their foreskins stuck back, as I have, then you'd have no doubts.' </p> <p>Before signing the consent form, I hesitated just for a moment, however. My son had already gone under the anaesthetic, and standing next to his unconscious form, I suddenly felt that it would be terribly wrong to make this decision on his behalf. I needed to discuss it with him, my husband, my son's father, my doctor and, as it turned out, anyone who could give me an opinion, be it cultural, emotional, sexual or medical. </p> <p>In the months that followed, I tried to get as much information as possible by raising what I discovered was the highly emotional and pun-ridden ('Let's get straight to the point,' said the urologist; and 'You must read this seminal work') subject of circumcision as often as I could. Both my uncircumcised husband and ex-husband were horrified that I had even considered agreeing to the operation. Meanwhile, my doctor prescribed an antibiotic cream to apply at the slightest sign of swelling and told us to take our time making up our minds. </p> <p>Jewish friends and a Muslim relative felt that my son's medical problems added weight to the cultural reasons for having their sons circumcised as babies. Religious circumcision may have its origins in ancient Egypt of 3000 BC. It was adopted by the Jews and later the Muslims, possibly as a hygienic measure in a hot and sandy climate. It then became a ritual of religious observance. </p> <p>Dr Schamroth of the Association of Progressive Mohalim, who performs circumcision on both Jewish and Muslim babies, says that 'it is not a nice thing to have to do to a newborn. As a doctor, I feel that there are no medical disadvantages in later life, though I don't feel there is overwhelming evidence of advantages either. My concern is to make it as untraumatic as possible, with local anaesthetic.' </p> <p>Talking to friends in mixed marriages with sons was also helpful because of the lengthy debates they had inevitably had during pregnancy. Sandra Rose is married to Paul, with a son aged three and a two-month-old daughter. He is Jewish and she was brought up in a non-religious family of Christian origin. 'The thought of any kind of operation removing healthy tissue was extremely difficult to get my head around,' she said. 'When Daniel was born, we spent three days arguing about it, and in the end I found my husband's religious and emotional reasons - he wanted a son that resembled him and his forefathers - more compelling than my squeamishness. In the event, the circumcision, when Daniel was eight days old, was a deeply moving family event, and Daniel didn't even cry.' </p> <p>The circumcision debate is not only between non-Jews and Jews and Muslims but international, intergenerational and in the case of my bother-in-law from Guyana - where only men of certain ancestry use circumcision as a mark - intertribal. British men of my grandfather's and father's generation were routinely circumcised at only a few days old. It is likely that circumcision was introduced in this country by doctors who felt that it would discourage masturbation, which was considered to be the cause of a number of illnesses, including epilepsy and blindness. This attitude prevailed until 1935, when the aptly named Dr Cockshut wrote in the British Medical Journal : 'I am convinced that masturbation is much less common in the circumcised - with these considerations in view, it does not seem apt to argue that \"God knows best how to make little boys\".' Circumcision later came to be considered more 'civilised' in that it was a sign of a hospital birth, and possibly because during both World Wars and the era of National Service, circumcised conscripts suffered from fewer infections if hygiene was poor. </p> <p>In America, there is now a radical anti-circumcision movement in response to a 60 per cent circumcision rate, which has gone down from nearly 90 per cent. There is also a small movement of American men who attempt to 'grow back' their foreskin by means of bands and weights. In the UK, there is little call for extreme pro- or anti-circumcision groups because a number of factors brought down the rate of circumcision to today's 10 per cent. A highly influential paper, 'The Fate of the Foreskin', was written in 1949 by a Dr Gairder, stating that most boys' foreskins retract naturally by the age of four or five and the rest by adolescence. Also, mothers started to question the practice at the same time as the NHS (where money was always tight) was born and sexual attitudes (masturbation no longer being considered the root of all evil) became more relaxed. </p> <p>At its most atavistic level, the debate can get nasty. Uncircumcised and circumcised men defend their own penile state. The circumcised are confident that they are smegma free, more aesthetically pleasing, free from cancer of the penis, urinary tract infections, premature ejaculation (I have even heard a circumcised man say that he has a bigger erection because there is no skin holding him back) and are better lovers. The uncircumcised feel they are more sensitive because the foreskin protects the glans, that women find them easier to 'handle' without lubrication. They, too, consider themselves to be better lovers. </p> <p>Mr Cuckow, consultant paediatrician urologist at London's Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, says that 'men can be far too concerned with either wanting a circumcision, or regretting one, or in the defending of non-circumcision in the context of the sexual performance. There is such a wide spectrum of normality when it comes to the penis, and sex involves such a huge range of stimuli and sensation, which are not all centred on the tip of the penis.' </p> <p>Although an important consideration, my son's future sex life is not the only thing I have to think about here. Above all, I don't want him to have to endure repeated discomfort or emergency dashes to the hospital. Cuckow is reassuring. 'At the end of the day, the foreskin is a normal piece of tissue which is not pathological, but like any part of the body, it does need some looking after. Be vigilant about gentle washing and tell your son to retract his foreskin a little when he does a pee.' </p> <p>In a quiet moment, I gently told my son some of the things I had learned and asked what he thought. I was surprised to hear that although he wasn't that keen on the operation, he would have it done if he could go back to the same hospital - 'because they had the best Nintendo 64 game console that I have ever seen. That's a good enough reason, isn't it?' The decision is on hold. </p> <p><strong> Circumcision: the facts </strong> </p> <p><strong> The foreskin </strong> In most boys, the foreskin (also called a prepuce) is attached to the head of the penis at birth. It keeps the glans soft, moist and sensitive and protects it from exposure and chaffing. During growth and development, the foreskin gradually separates from the head of the penis or glans and it is extremely inadvisable to pull it back forcibly, as unenlightened paediatricians used to do. Consultant Mr Wilcox of the paediatric urology department of Guy's hospital says that this 'may cause tears and scar tissue, which will mean problems in retracting the foreskin later on'. </p> <p><strong> Problems </strong> These three conditions are the most common reasons for medical circumcision but many doctors, urologists and paediatricians would now consider other treatments such as antibiotic and steroid creams as well as gentle and extremely gradual stretching exercises. </p> <p>\u0095 Phimosis, or tight foreskin: a condition in which the foreskin cannot be drawn back. It may cause the foreskin to balloon out on urination, which may in turn cause urinary tract complications. </p> <p>\u0095 Paraphimosis: a condition in which the foreskin, having been retracted, is too tight to re-cover the glans. The trapped foreskin then causes the glans to swell and fill with fluid. </p> <p>\u0095 Balanitis: inflammation of the foreskin or glans. It may be caused by irritants such as soap, a build-up of smegma (natural waxy cream-coloured substance under the foreskin), or friction. </p> <p><strong> Hygiene </strong> One of the reasons many paediatric urologists think that boys have problems with their foreskins is that parents, and particularly mothers, are unwilling or embarrassed to teach boys how to properly clean themselves. In the bath, boys from the age of four or five should be taught to very gently pull back the foreskin a small way and clean as much of the glans and foreskin as they can. As they get older, they will be able to pull the foreskin back further so they can wash away urine and smegma. If the foreskin does get stuck back, then try to firmly pull it back into its normal position as soon as possible because any delay increases the chance of swelling. If this is impossible, then get to hospital as quickly as you can. </p> <p><strong> Circumcision </strong> Circumcision is the surgical removal of the sleeve of skin and mucosal tissue that normally covers the head of the penis. In very repeated cases of infection, medical circumcision may be seriously considered. It is worthwhile getting a second or third opinion from other urologists. In most medical circumcisions, which commonly occur in mid- to late childhood, a general anaesthetic is used, but with infants, a local anaesthetic cream or injection can provide a penile nerve block. Some doctors and all Orthodox Jewish mohels (the men who perform the task) prefer to avoid the small risks posed by anaesthetic agents. There is a good deal of controversy about how much the baby is traumatised by circumcision. </p> <p><strong> Timing</strong> If your child must be circumcised, think carefully about the timing. Penelope Leach recommends that parents wait until the boy is more than six: 'The younger they are, the more difficult it is for them to understand that removing the foreskin will not damage the organ.' If the boy is prepubescent or adolescent and self-conscious, he may find the whole process deeply embarrassing and humiliating. Circumcision is a minor operation, but it can be extremely upsetting. </p> <p><strong> Recovery </strong> Older boys may find the few days after circumcision extremely painful. There are many ways to help keep the pressure off, such as using a sports box or sitting on a beanbag. </p> <p><strong> Websites <br> <a href=\"http://www.users.dircon.co.uk/~vernon/ICIRC\">www.users.dircon.co.uk/~vernon/</a> </strong> British no-nonsense website; mainly pro-circumcision. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.cirp.org\">www.cirp.org</a></strong>\" American, highly researched website with anti-circumcision leanings. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://dmoz.org/health\">dmoz.org/health</a>/</strong> Level-headed, and aimed at parents trying to make a decision.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One terrible evening last year, my eight-year-old son's foreskin got stuck back at bathtime when he was routinely cleaning himself. Within minutes, it had alarmingly ballooned behind a tight red ring of swollen skin and he was screaming with pain. My husband was still at work and I suddenly felt desperately inadequate. What should I do? Perhaps there was a knack to this? Was this something that happened to boys that I didn't know about? I phoned my GP, who told me that this was an emergency and to get to hospital immediately. My son then had to endure an hour of agony which overcame his extreme embarrassment at having to hold an ice-pack on his genitals while dozens of medical staff came in to our cubicle and gave their opinion. When that failed to bring down the swelling, he was given morphine, followed by gas and air, while a consultant tried to manipulate his foreskin back into its usual position. Despite being told that we were very lucky that the 'foreskin expert' just happened to be in the hospital and this consultant had 'never encountered one that he could not get back', in the end my son was put under general anaesthetic to drain the fluid by a small incision. I was told that he had a bad attack of balanitis - inflammation of the foreskin - which is why he was complaining of having a sore willy. When he tried to clean it in the bath by pulling back his foreskin, paraphimosis occurred. This is when the retracted circle of foreskin becomes tight and swollen, and then fluid builds up behind the tight ring of skin. Before he went into the operating theatre I was told that 'he would certainly have to be circumcised at some point and did I want it done now so he would not need another operation?' Even though I was warned that the swelling would make it slightly more tricky, my immediate response was: 'Yes, of course.' I should explain that there is a history of tight foreskins in my family, with one case of circumcision in late childhood. More importantly, I never wanted my son to have to endure this kind of agony again. The consultant added, 'If you had seen as many old men with their foreskins stuck back, as I have, then you'd have no doubts.' Before signing the consent form, I hesitated just for a moment, however. My son had already gone under the anaesthetic, and standing next to his unconscious form, I suddenly felt that it would be terribly wrong to make this decision on his behalf. I needed to discuss it with him, my husband, my son's father, my doctor and, as it turned out, anyone who could give me an opinion, be it cultural, emotional, sexual or medical. In the months that followed, I tried to get as much information as possible by raising what I discovered was the highly emotional and pun-ridden ('Let's get straight to the point,' said the urologist; and 'You must read this seminal work') subject of circumcision as often as I could. Both my uncircumcised husband and ex-husband were horrified that I had even considered agreeing to the operation. Meanwhile, my doctor prescribed an antibiotic cream to apply at the slightest sign of swelling and told us to take our time making up our minds. Jewish friends and a Muslim relative felt that my son's medical problems added weight to the cultural reasons for having their sons circumcised as babies. Religious circumcision may have its origins in ancient Egypt of 3000 BC. It was adopted by the Jews and later the Muslims, possibly as a hygienic measure in a hot and sandy climate. It then became a ritual of religious observance. Dr Schamroth of the Association of Progressive Mohalim, who performs circumcision on both Jewish and Muslim babies, says that 'it is not a nice thing to have to do to a newborn. As a doctor, I feel that there are no medical disadvantages in later life, though I don't feel there is overwhelming evidence of advantages either. My concern is to make it as untraumatic as possible, with local anaesthetic.' Talking to friends in mixed marriages with sons was also helpful because of the lengthy debates they had inevitably had during pregnancy. Sandra Rose is married to Paul, with a son aged three and a two-month-old daughter. He is Jewish and she was brought up in a non-religious family of Christian origin. 'The thought of any kind of operation removing healthy tissue was extremely difficult to get my head around,' she said. 'When Daniel was born, we spent three days arguing about it, and in the end I found my husband's religious and emotional reasons - he wanted a son that resembled him and his forefathers - more compelling than my squeamishness. In the event, the circumcision, when Daniel was eight days old, was a deeply moving family event, and Daniel didn't even cry.' The circumcision debate is not only between non-Jews and Jews and Muslims but international, intergenerational and in the case of my bother-in-law from Guyana - where only men of certain ancestry use circumcision as a mark - intertribal. British men of my grandfather's and father's generation were routinely circumcised at only a few days old. It is likely that circumcision was introduced in this country by doctors who felt that it would discourage masturbation, which was considered to be the cause of a number of illnesses, including epilepsy and blindness. This attitude prevailed until 1935, when the aptly named Dr Cockshut wrote in the British Medical Journal : 'I am convinced that masturbation is much less common in the circumcised - with these considerations in view, it does not seem apt to argue that \"God knows best how to make little boys\".' Circumcision later came to be considered more 'civilised' in that it was a sign of a hospital birth, and possibly because during both World Wars and the era of National Service, circumcised conscripts suffered from fewer infections if hygiene was poor. In America, there is now a radical anti-circumcision movement in response to a 60 per cent circumcision rate, which has gone down from nearly 90 per cent. There is also a small movement of American men who attempt to 'grow back' their foreskin by means of bands and weights. In the UK, there is little call for extreme pro- or anti-circumcision groups because a number of factors brought down the rate of circumcision to today's 10 per cent. A highly influential paper, 'The Fate of the Foreskin', was written in 1949 by a Dr Gairder, stating that most boys' foreskins retract naturally by the age of four or five and the rest by adolescence. Also, mothers started to question the practice at the same time as the NHS (where money was always tight) was born and sexual attitudes (masturbation no longer being considered the root of all evil) became more relaxed. At its most atavistic level, the debate can get nasty. Uncircumcised and circumcised men defend their own penile state. The circumcised are confident that they are smegma free, more aesthetically pleasing, free from cancer of the penis, urinary tract infections, premature ejaculation (I have even heard a circumcised man say that he has a bigger erection because there is no skin holding him back) and are better lovers. The uncircumcised feel they are more sensitive because the foreskin protects the glans, that women find them easier to 'handle' without lubrication. They, too, consider themselves to be better lovers. Mr Cuckow, consultant paediatrician urologist at London's Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, says that 'men can be far too concerned with either wanting a circumcision, or regretting one, or in the defending of non-circumcision in the context of the sexual performance. There is such a wide spectrum of normality when it comes to the penis, and sex involves such a huge range of stimuli and sensation, which are not all centred on the tip of the penis.' Although an important consideration, my son's future sex life is not the only thing I have to think about here. Above all, I don't want him to have to endure repeated discomfort or emergency dashes to the hospital. Cuckow is reassuring. 'At the end of the day, the foreskin is a normal piece of tissue which is not pathological, but like any part of the body, it does need some looking after. Be vigilant about gentle washing and tell your son to retract his foreskin a little when he does a pee.' In a quiet moment, I gently told my son some of the things I had learned and asked what he thought. I was surprised to hear that although he wasn't that keen on the operation, he would have it done if he could go back to the same hospital - 'because they had the best Nintendo 64 game console that I have ever seen.
