Of the 105m 60-kilo bags produced globally each year, Brazil accounts for between 30m and 40m, depending on the harvest.

In an interview with the Guardian, Brian Davis, chief executive of Nationwide, staked his claim to the e-banking crown. \"We're in the market place.

The broadside by Nationwide, which has 200,000 customers for its three-year-old internet bank, comes as established financial services companies and new players vie for net customers. Former building societies Halifax and Abbey National are using the internet to try to win current account customers - 80% of whom bank with the four retail clearers, NatWest, Lloyds TSB, HSBC and Barclays. Mr Davis insisted the online rates he could offer were improved by the building society's ongoing mutual status. \"If I was a plc, the people that backed me would be shareholders,\" he argued, adding that his members' benefit came in the form of higher interest rates. \"We can out-price plcs at the end of the day.\" However, Jim Spowart, chief executive of Intelligent Finance, retorted that Nationwide was merely offering a \"loss-leading product\". While the mutual versus plc argument is a long-running one - one rival sniped yesterday that Nationwide was frittering away capital which could be used for windfalls - this contest is for online customers, who are \"cheaper\" than those relying on branch networks. Rivals pointed out that Nationwide's e-Savings product is attached to the society's FlexAccount, requiring customers to open two accounts if they want access to the high savings rate. The \u00a350,000 cap on deposits also raised eyebrows but Mr Davis said this was designed to prevent it being swamped by deposits. While the banks and building societies also face new entrants on the net, analysis by KPMG appears to suggest it is the established players which will win the e-banking race. \"Although new e-banks have the speed, agility and ability to adjust to new demands, free from legacy IT issues, the incumbent major European banks have three crucial competitive advantages that will help them win: traffic, trust and multi-channel access,\" the KMPG report, Awakening Giants, concludes. The report also highlights the two-pronged strategy which has emerged among the financial services institutions: set up \"baby banks\" on the net, like Halifax, in apparent competition to own-branded online services, or put everything behind own-brand businesses in cyberspace, the path being followed by Barclays. While Nordic countries have been faster to take to the internet than neighbours, accounting for a third of Europe's 6m online customers, KPMG predicts \"m-banking\" - on mobile devices - will grow faster. While KPMG concludes that customers are unlikely to embrace new players in the long term, there appears to be little let-up in investors' appetite for new initiatives in this battle of the banks.

The amount it could charge the operators was largely fixed. As a result Railtrack was not able to compensate for the 20% growth in the number of trains on the network. Railtrack's views about the growth in the market was underlined by figures from the Department of Transport figures published yesterday. They showed that the number of passenger miles last year was the highest since 1946 while the number of journeys was the highest since the early 1960s. </p> <p>The financial regime under which the company was set up had also assumed that Railtrack would invest some \u00a33.5bn in the first five years while the group had actually spent some \u00a32bn more than that.

      "body": "<p>St Pancras Church in London's Euston Road is like an early 19th-century experiment in postmodernism, an odd, enduring mix of pagan and Christian, British and Greek. So the temporary addition of a live art installation to the church doesn't come as much of a surprise. A glass shelf is currently suspended three metres above the ground via an elegant construction of chrome stilts, and for three-and-a-half hours each evening, dancer and choreographer Carol Brown is performing her solo Shelf Life. </p> <p>The installation was created with visual artist Esther Rolinson and began as a dialogue between movement and architecture - the raised shelf defining the area within which Brown can move and the perspective from which she's viewed. But the concept evolved a further cluster of metaphors - of things being left on shelves, of the slow, inexorable processes of age and decay - and these are now a central part of the performance. </p> <p>Brown is an assertive, even glamorous, performer, confidently angling her strong body through different planes and levels as she works within the limits of her stage. But she also operates from an unusually calm focus, so even as we register the ambitious structures of her choreography we're also caught by the sense of a slow, steady heartbeat grounding all her moves. As traffic noise snarled up with the serene washes of Russell Skoons's sound score, it was as if we could hear the sound of two conflicting human rhythms - the ragged palpitations of city life and the internal pulse dramatised by Brown's body. As ordinary people were briefly snagged into watching the show - passing by on buses or looking down from flats and offices - Brown's meditative dance, isolated on her shelf, seemed an icon of contemplation, a little memento mori. It was the neatest possible justification of live art - life, simply, being turned into art. </p> <p>Until June 2. 020-7387 0031. ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible</p>",

      "bodyText": "St Pancras Church in London's Euston Road is like an early 19th-century experiment in postmodernism, an odd, enduring mix of pagan and Christian, British and Greek. So the temporary addition of a live art installation to the church doesn't come as much of a surprise. A glass shelf is currently suspended three metres above the ground via an elegant construction of chrome stilts, and for three-and-a-half hours each evening, dancer and choreographer Carol Brown is performing her solo Shelf Life. The installation was created with visual artist Esther Rolinson and began as a dialogue between movement and architecture - the raised shelf defining the area within which Brown can move and the perspective from which she's viewed. But the concept evolved a further cluster of metaphors - of things being left on shelves, of the slow, inexorable processes of age and decay - and these are now a central part of the performance. Brown is an assertive, even glamorous, performer, confidently angling her strong body through different planes and levels as she works within the limits of her stage. But she also operates from an unusually calm focus, so even as we register the ambitious structures of her choreography we're also caught by the sense of a slow, steady heartbeat grounding all her moves. As traffic noise snarled up with the serene washes of Russell Skoons's sound score, it was as if we could hear the sound of two conflicting human rhythms - the ragged palpitations of city life and the internal pulse dramatised by Brown's body. As ordinary people were briefly snagged into watching the show - passing by on buses or looking down from flats and offices - Brown's meditative dance, isolated on her shelf, seemed an icon of contemplation, a little memento mori. It was the neatest possible justification of live art - life, simply, being turned into art. Until June 2. 020-7387 0031. ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible",

They also need the leaders, Italy, to fail to beat Turkey. Otherwise it will be a place in the third-fourth play-off. </p> <p>Slovakia are in a slightly stronger position, as a draw will do if Italy lose. To that end Wilkinson claimed, after training at a rain-soaked ground on the outskirts of the capital, that the formation he had used during the kick-about bore no relation to his actual line-up for tonight but was for the benefit of a Slovakian television cameraman. </p> <p>\"We came here not knowing much about Slovakia,\" he added, \"certainly not as much as if [the England coach] Kevin Keegan was preparing for a game against them.\" However the Under-21 coach did admit that he had seen videos of Slovakia's two games and says that he was very impressed. </p> <p>\"They've deserved their results [a 2-1 win against Turkey and a 1-1 draw with Italy]. They are a very experienced squad and they'll be playing in front of a full house. They have played together for a long time, they move the ball about and are nice and tidy. </p> <p>\"But our lack of a crowd, particularly against Turkey, did not have a massive negative effect and I hope it does not have a massive positive effect [for the Slovaks]. They have deserved the results they have got. They're an experienced squad, it will be a full house, so it's game on.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson also singled out the left-sided midfielder Vratislav Gresko as a danger man. He was a member of the Bayer Leverkusen team who missed out on the Bundesliga title on the final day of last season and also played in their Champions League campaign. And in terms of reputation he is seen as something of a David Beckham, if only for his ability to cross the ball at set-pieces. </p> <p>His delivery could be crucial tonight given that Wilkinson singled out England's failure to deal with set-pieces as a contributing factor to their 2-0 defeat by Italy. </p> <p>However, Nicky Weaver is confident that England can extend their stay here and is hopeful the Turks can help by getting the better of Italy. </p> <p>\"There's no extra pressure on us,\" the Manchester City goalkeeper said. \"It wasn't a great result against Italy but we bounced back well against Turkey [6-0] and now we know we've got to win and hope Turkey get a result against Italy. I certainly don't think we're just playing to get in the play-off. Stranger things have happened.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson will have to reshuffle his left flank tonight as Derby County's Seth Johnson is suspended. And the coach was intent to continue his mind games and leave the Slovakia coach Dusan Radolsky guessing as he cited Jon Harley, Ledley King and Anthony Gardner as possible replacements. </p> <p>While one of those, probably Chelsea's Harley, will get the nod, with King remaining in central defence, spare a thought for Lee Hendrie. The midfielder has had a terrible 12 days, only a late substitute in Aston Villa's unsuccessful FA Cup final side and then losing his place here. He started against Italy last Saturday but, despite being one of the few to do himself justice, he was taken off at half-time and did not feature in Monday's rout of Turkey. </p> <p>Wilkinson confirmed Hendrie is not injured but refused to elaborate. \"I have spoken to him. I have changed the team and David Dunn, once he got over the first 20 minutes back in at this level, did very well.

      "body": "<p>Last night England looked like a team about to go places. Precisely where was not always clear but the spirit of this victory in their last serious test before the European Championship was encouraging even if the performance was patchy.</p> <p>A match designed to give Steve McManaman a platform to roam as freely and effectively as he did in helping Real Madrid to win the European Cup did not turn out quite like that.</p> <p>McManaman set about his task willingly enough but Paul Scholes took the eye more when his limited role in midfield allowed him to get forward, and the goals came from England's most reliable source.</p> <p>Both followed corners from David Beckham, the first scored by Robbie Fowler shortly before half-time, the second by Tony Adams midway through the second half, his first England goal for 11 years. Both also owed much to the presence of Alan Shearer in the penalty area.</p> <p>Playing his last England game at Wembley before he retires from international football, Shearer showed the aggression, perception and speed of reaction which will be so crucial for Kevin Keegan in Euro 2000.</p> <p>Overall the performance was an improvement on last Saturday's tepid 1-1 draw with Brazil. Certainly it was as positive as the coach had promised, with Sol Campbell driving forward at every opportunity. But for a long time, hard though Scholes and the freshly capped Steven Gerrard worked in midfield, the passing was prosaic and predictable and not until the second half did England start to break their chronic habit of giving the ball away when not under pressure.</p> <p>There were times when England's football shrieked aloud for Dennis Wise's passes to pull it together.

      "bodyText": "Last night England looked like a team about to go places. Precisely where was not always clear but the spirit of this victory in their last serious test before the European Championship was encouraging even if the performance was patchy. A match designed to give Steve McManaman a platform to roam as freely and effectively as he did in helping Real Madrid to win the European Cup did not turn out quite like that. McManaman set about his task willingly enough but Paul Scholes took the eye more when his limited role in midfield allowed him to get forward, and the goals came from England's most reliable source. Both followed corners from David Beckham, the first scored by Robbie Fowler shortly before half-time, the second by Tony Adams midway through the second half, his first England goal for 11 years. Both also owed much to the presence of Alan Shearer in the penalty area. Playing his last England game at Wembley before he retires from international football, Shearer showed the aggression, perception and speed of reaction which will be so crucial for Kevin Keegan in Euro 2000. Overall the performance was an improvement on last Saturday's tepid 1-1 draw with Brazil. Certainly it was as positive as the coach had promised, with Sol Campbell driving forward at every opportunity. But for a long time, hard though Scholes and the freshly capped Steven Gerrard worked in midfield, the passing was prosaic and predictable and not until the second half did England start to break their chronic habit of giving the ball away when not under pressure. There were times when England's football shrieked aloud for Dennis Wise's passes to pull it together. For all that, Gerrard did well enough to give Keegan a satisfactory option should anything happen to Paul Ince. Individually there were other successes. Fowler, even before he scored, allayed any doubts Keegan might have had about the striker's sharpness following his injury problems. In goal, moreover, Nigel Martyn made a series of saves from Andrei Shevchenko to suggest that, while he might be No2 to David Seaman, he is really England's No1. To accommodate McManaman's roaming activities Keegan, as expected, played with three at the back and used Beckham and Phil Neville to give England's movements consistent width. It quickly became apparent, however, that this was never going to recreate the circumstances McManaman enjoys when Michel Salgado and Roberto Carlos are his wing-backs. In addition Neville's need to switch the ball to his right foot when he did advance on the left meant that McManaman's hopes of creating something by drifting inside from that flank were limited. At the start England looked more effective when Fowler was driftng to the right and providing low crosses to coincide with Scholes's late runs through the middle. From the second of these the Manchester United man hit a post. Defensively England looked suspect against the pace of Sergei Kandaurov. Adams never looks comfortable in the middle of a back three but his interception to deny Shevchenko a chance proved crucial as England struggled to get their act together. Towards half-time, in fact, their movements became sufficiently co-ordinated to pose more problems for Ukraine's defenders. From the right-hand byline Beckham set up a chance for Fowler, who was thwarted by the awkward cross, but in the 44th minute Shearer met a corner with a downward header which Kernozenko blocked only for Fowler to score from the rebound. Emile Heskey replaced Fowler for the second half without fulfilling the promise his partnership with Shearer had shown against Argentina. Nick Barmby, another substitute, later set up opportunities for both Heskey and McManaman but neither could beat Kernozenko. England's second goal, in the 67th minute, arrived after Kernozenko had punched another corner from Beckham on to the chest of the diving Shearer, the ball bouncing off the captain at a convenient angle for Adams to drive it into the net. By then England had cause to be grateful for the agility of Martyn, who had blocked a shot from Shevchenko by the near post, dived full length to turn wide a header from the same player and then turned a deflected free-kick from the striker over the bar. In the end England could be reasonably satisfied with the evening except that its main object had hardly been fulfilled. A wandering McManaman may yet be the answer but last night the question was never really put.",

Whatever way you look at it, Martin O'Neill's record at Leicester is extraordinary.

The long serving Caernarfon MP, who received treatment for a heart condition last Christmas, is giving up the post on medical advice. He has also decided to step down as leader of the 17-strong group in the assembly where Plaid Cymru forms the main opposition to the minority Labour administration. He will remain in the post until the new party president has been elected in July. Mr Wigley, 57, said: \"I was advised last week by my heart consultant that I should offload the most onerous of my duties and in particular those which cause most stress.\" \"I wish to emphasise that my decision to step down is a personal one, with no political subtext whatsoever.\" Mr Wigley said it was with great sadness that any hope of becoming first secretary for Wales was over. \"It is however unfair to the party and to my colleagues if I were to cling on to these key posts at such a vital time, when I was not fully fit to fulfil the responsibilities in a way in which both I, and my col leagues, would wish,\" he added. Party members, who had hoped to persuade Mr Wigley to consider alternative ways of easing the burden on his health, accepted his decision reluctantly following an emotional meeting in Llandudno yesterday. Mr Wigley was elected MP for Caernarfon in February 1974 and has been president of the party since 1991. During his presidency the party's support at the polls has soared from 8% to 30% last May when Plaid Cymru snatched several traditional Labour heartland constituencies in the assembly elections. Plaid Cymru chairman Marc Phillips said the party's debt to Mr Wigley was incalculable. He said there could scarcely be another party that had benefited as much from the vision and energy of one man. First secretary Rhodri Morgan said Mr Wigley had made a major contribution to Welsh politics. \"I am sure he will continue to play a constructive part in the devolution story.\" The former Welsh secretary, Ron Davies, said the Plaid Cymru leader had done much to bring status and credibility to the assembly.

The grocer's daughter was not one of them - a chemist and a woman to boot. And of course, the chorus of support wafting from the dreaming spires for Tory policies over the past 20 years was, well, non-existent. </p> <p>Nevertheless, it behoves all good Tories to view the current spat with a cool temperament, and to avoid following the chancellor of the exchequer in with the boot. After all, Oxford is the victim of a sustained campaign of lies and distortion, half-truth and embellishment. It is our duty as an opposition to stand up for the truth and to point the finger at the guilty men. It is pretty clear where this campaign is going, and it is time we nipped it in the bud. </p> <p>Huge efforts are made by Oxford to encourage state school pupils to apply, from the abolition of entrance exams to the target schools programmes. If more did apply, more would get places. Further, to class all independent school pupils as little Lord Fauntleroys is simply wrong. Many of the pupils at independent schools who are applying to university at the moment were on assisted places until this government abolished them. Many are at schools where the fees are relatively modest and where parents save every spare penny they can to send their children there. Many are on scholarships or bursaries provided by the schools themselves. </p> <p>Any examination of the facts, then, would reveal that there is relatively little discrimination against state school pupils in our top universities, and enormous efforts being made to encourage them to apply. It is also worth noting that under 20 years of Conservative government, the proportion going on to higher education rose from just one in eight to almost one in three, and polytechnics became full universities. In a row about the democratisation of higher education, the Tories need no lessons from Labour. </p> <p>But this is not what the row is about, in any event. Gordon Brown is not interested in getting Laura Spence or anyone else a place at Oxford. He wants two things. First, a reprise of the old \"forces of conservatism\" row last autumn, when every monocle-sporting, jodhpur-wearing, sherry-drinking Tory came harrumphing out of the woodwork to remind people how ghastly we can be. So far, thankfully, we have resisted this temptation, though there are worrying signs we could become more vocal. </p> <p> It is Brown's and Labour's long-cherished desire to abolish independent schools. The wholesale destruction of our education system has long been Labour's project, based on a mixture of motives including cod educational trends and infantile class envy. The argument is that the brightest and the best of our pupils are siphoned off into bastions of privilege and learning and given a first-class education denied to the people. The answer is simply to abolish independent schools, so that everyone mixes together, all class divisions are abolished and education standards rocket up for everyone. </p> <p>Of course this is cloud cuckoo land, but one can see how a party that is used to appropriating private property and implementing plans for most aspects of our daily lives comes back to this solution again and again. But what Labour discovered when Harold Wilson set up the public schools commission is that many independent schools are very, very good. Not because of wealth and privilege, but because of ethos and standards. </p> <p>A good school succeeds for many reasons. It is a combination of a good head, a motivated teaching staff, engaged parents, and numerous other factors. But what sets independent schools apart, and what has seen some state schools succeed against the odds, is a feeling that the school is in charge of its own destiny. If you had visited some of the early grant-maintained schools in some of the most deprived inner-cities, you would have seen a school transformed, no, not by money, but by the head and teachers knowing that their decisions affected their destiny. </p> <p>Labour has run state education for the past 30 years, in councils up and down the land. The current row over access to university stands as a shaming indictment of everything the left in this country stands for. William Hague would do well to avoid being sucked too closely into further defences of Oxford University or elitism. Rather, he would do well to read out a charge sheet against the Labour party for what they have done to our schools. He should propose a new Tory manifesto. The abolition of local education authorities. The return of schools to their heads and teachers. Somehow, a way of emasculating the NUT, which has utterly destroyed teachers' public image. And the return of assisted places to resume the democratisation of our independent schools.

During a press conference at White Hart Lane this afternoon, Rebrov showed his English is improving rapidly and repeated his desire to play for Tottenham in the Premiership - but he gave very little else away.

And, going by Cole's track record, it wasn't going be long before he laid into his former club boss in a soaraway tabloid. But, to the surprise of everyone, Cole spoke out this afternoon instead. \"I had a meeting with [Kelvin Koogan] yesterday afternoon to discuss the situation regarding my foot,\" he said, sounding like an ailing pensioner. \"We both agreed the risk of not being able to perform fully in such an important tournament was too great a risk to take.\"</p> <p>But surely there must have been some sort of row somewhere?

Both Chelsea and Arsenal have sent representatives to watch Dutch striker Anthony Lurling in the current U-21 tournament in Slovakia. Lurling, 23, plays his club football for Heerenveen. Manchester United are thought to be ready to offer a two-year contract to Laurent Blanc. The Lord Imperial Ferg wants the 34-year-old to partner Jaap Stam while the champions wait for Sol Campbell's contract to expire at Tottenham. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has been left out of Holland's Euro 2000 squad. Frank Rijkaard has chosen Feyenoord's former Rangers striker Peter van Vossen instead. Blackburn have signed Manchester United defender John Curtis for \u00a31.5m. The 22-year-old full-back has just completed a successful loan spell at Barnsley. \"He is a boy we feel can only get better,\" said Graeme Souness. Mark Bosnich says he will only leave Manchester United if the club grant him a free transfer, despite the arrival of Fabien Barthez. \"When Manchester United inform me that I am free to leave under those same terms, I will do so,\" he said today. \"Until such time, I have three years remaining on my contract and I intend to see them out.\" Joe Kinnear has admitted he was \"minutes away\" from becoming Sheffield Wednesday's manager. \"The contract was perfect, it was just the programme on the future of the club,\" Kinnear told the SWFC website. \"I appreciate the programme that the club were taking, and I have nothing but the utmost respect, but I just thought that the ideas the club had were not mine and that's where we disagreed. It had to do with finances but any further statement should come from the chairman.\" Watford full-back Des Lyttle has joined West Brom on a free transfer. Fulham midfielder Steve Finnan has withdrawn from the Republic of Ireland squad for the three-match Nike Cup tournament in America. Oliver Dacourt has formally sealed his \u00a37.2m move to Leeds. Sergei Rebrov and Neil Sullivan have similarly completed their moves to Tottenham. Fulham are to play India's national team in a friendly at Craven Cottage on July 22. Former Atletico Madrid manager Radomir Antic is the new coach of Real Oviedo. Ayr have bought Dundee strikers Eddie Annand and James Grady. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: World Football (2.30am) The world likes it, and so do you.

James has said that the future of Star TV will partly depend on the successful adoption of new interactive services and one of the most difficult parts of his new job will be salvaging Star's links with Cable &amp; Wireless HongKong Telecom. Their joint venture has stuttered since Mr Murdoch lost out in a takeover battle for HKT with Pacific Century CyberWorks. James' rise at News Corp has been swift and fairly surprising given his early career. After quitting Harvard where he was studying history and film, the chain-smoking youngest son set up his own music label. Rawkus Entertainment was making a small profit on revenues of US$2.5m when it was bought by News Corp in 1998.",

In his first public pronouncement since becoming national director of mental health in April, Louis Appleby will guarantee radical reform of psychiatric services. He will also promise the phasing out of mixed-sex psychiatric wards within two years; an end to patients being sent to hospitals in other areas as soon as possible; and special training for psychiatrists in \"cultural awareness\". His commitments were welcomed by mental health groups, which have grown increasingly alarmed at ministers' focus on the public safety implications of mental health policy rather than the need for reform.

David Bowie, US country star Willie Nelson and lounge legend Burt Bacharach were among the acts announced yesterday for the 22nd festival, to be staged next month at its traditional home, Worthy Farm in Pilton, Somerset. The three artists, who have a combined age of 191, will all appear on the main stage on the final day, bringing the curtain down on three days of music, dance and performing arts that organisers are promising will be the biggest yet. The best selling pop act of last year, Travis, will headline on Saturday evening, a slot that traditionally brings out the extremes in the band of the moment. Oasis played a famously lacklustre set in 1996, while Pulp and Radiohead were generally thought to have triumphed in succeeding years. Travis had a hit last year with Why Does It Always Rain on Me?, so the band at least has the material to cope with adverse weather of the sort that has blighted two of the last three festivals.

An announcement will be issued tomorrow about a deal that would lead to a release of the hostages over the weekend. It is believed that Mr Speight's rebels will be bought off with promises of roles in a new civilian government for Fiji, although Mr Volavola says Mr Speight is unlikely to become prime minister. Mr Volavola spoke to reporters after military negotiators met Mr Speight for more than three hours inside the barracks from which Commodore Bainimarama has been running the country since martial law was imposed on Monday. Mr Speight went into the meeting with allies that he had named to his own \"cabinet\". After the negotiations had finished, Mr Speight remained for more than an hour inside the barracks drinking kava, a traditional mild sedative, with Commodore Bainimarama \"as if nothing had happened,\" Mr Volavola said. Mr Speight went across town to Commodore Bainimarama's military barracks late in the day, unarmed and in the company of 40 Fijian troops who had earlier gone into the parliamentary compound to seek the release of the hostages. A military spokesman said that, with his gunmen in the parliament still holding the hostages, Mr Speight's security had been guaranteed. It was Mr Speight's longest trip away from the scene of the hostage crisis since it began, although he had made other brief appearances outside parliament accompanied by armed guards. Since taking power, the army has accepted Mr Speight's major demands: scrapping the 1997 constitution which guarantees equal rights for the ethnic Indian minority, deposing President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara and offering Mr Speight and his gang an amnesty. Having initially said that it would install a civil administration to restore democracy to Fiji, the military said yesterday it may stay in power for up to three years until a new constitution is drawn up and fresh elections planned. Mr Speight has called on the military instead to install his self-styled Fijian nationalist government. The United States, Australia and New Zealand have threatened sanctions if democracy is not returned to democratic rule. \u0095 A hostage who was freed yesterday to go to a funeral - on condition that she return to captivity - has not come back. \"If she comes back, she comes back,\" Mr Speight's spokesman Joe Nata said. \"If she doesn't, she doesn't.\"",

Tony Greig was bowling from the Vauxhall end, in his offbreak mode. Richards took a step or two down the pitch, got a little inside-edge to a well-pitched-up ball and it sneaked through onto his stumps. I remember being frustrated that I'd missed out on seeing a triple-century (probably not quite as frustrated as Viv though). It was 14 years before I did see one in the flesh - Graham Gooch's 333 at Lord's in 1990. That Oval match was the famous one when Michael Holding bowled like the wind and took 14 wickets. And Dennis Amiss, using a new exaggerated back-and-across technique, made 203 in his comeback game after being left out because he'd struggled against pace bowling. Despite Amiss's efforts West Indies won by 231 runs, to take the series 3-0.</p> <p> <strong>When was the last time David Gower played for England?</strong> asks David Tyrrell</p> <p>Gower made his last Test appearance against Pakistan at The Oval in August 1992. He made 27 and 1. He finished with 8231 runs from 117 Tests - both England records at the time (but both later overtaken by Graham Gooch), at an average of 44.25, with 18 hundreds. Gower also played in 114 one-day internationals, the last in February 1991, scoring 3170 runs at 30.77, with seven centuries. </p> <p> <strong>Did the father of the novelist HG Wells play cricket for England?</strong> asks Peter Gardner</p> <p>Wells's father Joseph didn't play for England - but he did turn out for Kent, for whom he took four wickets with successive balls against Sussex at Brighton in 1862. He's actually the first person credited with that feat in first-class cricket.</p> <p> <strong>Is it out if the wicketkeeper holds the ball in his hands and knocks the bails off with his legs while the batsman is out of his crease?</strong> asks Anirban Majumdar</p> <p>He shouldn't be given out, because Law 28 says that the fielder has to break the stumps \"with his hand or arm, provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used\". You can be out stumped (Law 39) if the ball rebounds off the wicketkeeper's pads and hits the stumps with the striker out of his ground. For all the Laws, go to the <a href=\"http://www.lords.org/mcc/laws/index.html\">Lord's website</a>. </p> <p> <strong>Ross Gregory did well for Australia in the 1936-37 Ashes series. Why didn't he tour England in 1938?</strong> asks John Thurbin</p> <p>Gregory was a quick-footed right-hand batsman who made his debut for Victoria while he was still at school. He was only 20 when he was called up for the last two Tests of the 1936-37 Ashes series - which, uniquely, Australia came from 2-0 down to win 3-2 - and made 23 and 50 at Adelaide and 80 at Melbourne. There weren't any Tests in 1937-38, and Gregory didn't make a century in domestic cricket that season, although he was fairly consistent. When the team to tour England was chosen Gregory was left out. It's difficult to find out why, at this distance - but two of the untried batsmen who did come were Lindsay Hassett and Sidney Barnes, who both became fine players. One book suggests that the man who got Gregory's place was Arthur Chipperfield, who had made 99 on Test debut himself in England in 1934. England never did see Ross Gregory play: he was killed in action in the war in 1942. </p> <p> <strong>Which former Yorkshire and England wicketkeeper committed suicide in 1998?</strong> asks Mark Seymour</p> <p>It was David Bairstow, the barrel-chested ginger-haired keeper who made his first-class debut as a schoolboy in 1970. In all he played 429 matches for Yorkshire, and captained them from 1984 to 1986. Only 14 wicketkeepers have bettered his career tally of 1099 first-class dismissals - and he scored 13,961 runs as well. \"Bluey\" Bairstow played four Tests for England, including the 1980 Centenary Test against Australia at Lord's, and also appeared in 21 one-day internationals. After retirement he had some business and personal problems, and sadly hanged himself at home on January 5, 1998. He was only 46. An excellent obituary, by David Hopps, appeared in the March 1998 edition of <em>Wisden Cricket Monthly.</em></p> <p> <strong>Has Taunton in Somerset ever hosted a Test match?</strong> asks Sahil Malik</p> <p>The County Ground at Taunton has never staged a Test match (only seven grounds in England have), but it has staged three one-day internationals. The first was in the 1983 World Cup: England made 333 for 9 from their 60 overs (David Gower 130), then restricted Sri Lanka to 286, Vic Marks, the offspinner playing on his home ground, took 5-32. The other two were in last year's World Cup: first Zimbabwe beat Kenya by five wickets, then India hammered Sri Lanka in a record-breaking match. India's 373 for 6 (only 50 overs this time) included a record one-day stand of 318 for the second wicket between Sourav Ganguly (183) and Rahul Dravid (145). Sri Lanka made only 216 (Robin Singh 5-31) to lose by 157 runs. This defeat confirmed that the 1996 champions would not be able to reach the next phase of the 1999 tournament.</p> <p> <strong>Can you tell me when England will next tour the West Indies, and whether an itinerary is yet available?</strong> asks Peter Barnett</p> <p>England's next tour of the Caribbean is planned for the winter of 2003-04. The itinerary probably won't be released until early in 2003. The next Test series in the Caribbean will start in February or March 2001, when South Africa go there for their first full five-Test series. West Indies will be itching to avenge the 5-0 drubbing they suffered in South Africa in 1998-99, so that should be well worth watching.</p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Foster,+Jodie\">Jodie Foster</a> has moved swiftly to deny mushrooming speculation (triggered by a report in the Daily Mirror) that she is pregnant with her second child. Representatives of the 37-year-old actress insisted yesterday that the story is a complete fiction, and explain that Foster may simply have been overheard remarking that she would like a playmate for her 18-month-old son Charlie. The Mirror's original report did not go so far as to name the father of the alleged child, but Foster has always kept a tight lock on her personal life. The identity of baby number-one's dad remains one of Hollywood's most closely guarded secrets.</p> <p>\u0095 Bouncing back after recent disappointments, <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Lee,+Spike\">Spike Lee</a> has announced that he is to executive-produce an original movie for the Showtime cable channel in the US. Written and directed by Lee Davis, 3am is a New York-set drama revolving around the experiences of three taxi-drivers and the cast includes Danny Glover and Pam Grier. For Lee it's a tentative return to film-making after wary studio bosses rejected him from the job that he really wanted - the director's role on the forthcoming Muhammad Ali biopic.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Clooney,+George\">George Clooney</a> is reported to be in negotiations to play a cuckolded husband in Unfaithful, the next film from glossy British director Adrian (Lolita) Lyne. The problem is that the film, an Americanised overhaul of Claude Chabrol's 1969 French psycho-drama La Femme Infidele, may struggle to fit into Clooney's busy schedule. With The Perfect Storm set for summer release, the ER graduate is currently shaping up to star in Ocean's Eleven for old collaborator Steven (Out of Sight) Soderbergh.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Hackman,+Gene\">Gene Hackman</a> is in line to star in the Fox thriller Behind Enemy Lines, about two marines who find themselves dropped (you guessed it) behind enemy lines. One of these marines is a wet-behind-the-ears rookie, the other a grizzled old pro. No surprise to learn, then, that Hackman is tipped to play the latter part.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Kinnear,+Greg\">Greg Kinnear</a> is reported to be in talks to sign up to the new Ashley Judd picture, Animal Husbandry, about an anthropologically minded minx who applies the rules of the animal kingdom to her own troubled love life. Kinnear would play Judd's feckless boyfriend. Tony Goldwyn directs and the film is due to start shooting at the end of the summer. </p> <p>\u0095 Consolidating his success in the likes of The Faculty and The Virgin Suicides, hot-property <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Hartnett,+Josh\">Josh Hartnett</a> is in negotiations to play the lead role in 40 Days, 40 Nights, a hip comedy-drama to be co-produced by Universal and Miramax. Hartnett would play the once-burnt-twice-shy hero who gives up sex for Lent only to find his abstinence tested when he meets a young cutey to whom he just can't say no. The film is written by Rob Perez and will be directed by loose-cannon director Michael Lehmann, whose wayward career has carried him from the sublime (Heathers) to the ridiculous (Hudson Hawk). Alluring Kate Holmes (Joey out of Dawson's Creek) was initially lined up to play Hartnett's love-interest, but TV commitments are now thought to have prevented her involvement.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Jodie Foster has moved swiftly to deny mushrooming speculation (triggered by a report in the Daily Mirror) that she is pregnant with her second child. Representatives of the 37-year-old actress insisted yesterday that the story is a complete fiction, and explain that Foster may simply have been overheard remarking that she would like a playmate for her 18-month-old son Charlie. The Mirror's original report did not go so far as to name the father of the alleged child, but Foster has always kept a tight lock on her personal life. The identity of baby number-one's dad remains one of Hollywood's most closely guarded secrets. \u0095 Bouncing back after recent disappointments, Spike Lee has announced that he is to executive-produce an original movie for the Showtime cable channel in the US. Written and directed by Lee Davis, 3am is a New York-set drama revolving around the experiences of three taxi-drivers and the cast includes Danny Glover and Pam Grier. For Lee it's a tentative return to film-making after wary studio bosses rejected him from the job that he really wanted - the director's role on the forthcoming Muhammad Ali biopic. \u0095 George Clooney is reported to be in negotiations to play a cuckolded husband in Unfaithful, the next film from glossy British director Adrian (Lolita) Lyne. The problem is that the film, an Americanised overhaul of Claude Chabrol's 1969 French psycho-drama La Femme Infidele, may struggle to fit into Clooney's busy schedule. With The Perfect Storm set for summer release, the ER graduate is currently shaping up to star in Ocean's Eleven for old collaborator Steven (Out of Sight) Soderbergh. \u0095 Gene Hackman is in line to star in the Fox thriller Behind Enemy Lines, about two marines who find themselves dropped (you guessed it) behind enemy lines. One of these marines is a wet-behind-the-ears rookie, the other a grizzled old pro. No surprise to learn, then, that Hackman is tipped to play the latter part. \u0095 Greg Kinnear is reported to be in talks to sign up to the new Ashley Judd picture, Animal Husbandry, about an anthropologically minded minx who applies the rules of the animal kingdom to her own troubled love life. Kinnear would play Judd's feckless boyfriend. Tony Goldwyn directs and the film is due to start shooting at the end of the summer. \u0095 Consolidating his success in the likes of The Faculty and The Virgin Suicides, hot-property Josh Hartnett is in negotiations to play the lead role in 40 Days, 40 Nights, a hip comedy-drama to be co-produced by Universal and Miramax. Hartnett would play the once-burnt-twice-shy hero who gives up sex for Lent only to find his abstinence tested when he meets a young cutey to whom he just can't say no. The film is written by Rob Perez and will be directed by loose-cannon director Michael Lehmann, whose wayward career has carried him from the sublime (Heathers) to the ridiculous (Hudson Hawk). Alluring Kate Holmes (Joey out of Dawson's Creek) was initially lined up to play Hartnett's love-interest, but TV commitments are now thought to have prevented her involvement.",

Sometimes I pretended to take notes during professional meetings, when in fact,\" he smiles, \"I was somewhere else.\" </p> <p>Levy's success story began two years ago when his sister Lorraine, a television scriptwriter, discovered a half-finished manuscript and persuaded her brother to develop it for an adult audience. The novel was immediately accepted by the respected Paris publisher Robert Laffont Editions, and programmed into its bestseller collection for the coming season. </p> <p>Set in San Francisco, where Levy lived as a student, If Only It Were True tells the story of Arthur, an architect who moves into an apartment and discovers in his closet the spirit of a young woman, Lauren, who has been in hospital in a coma for six months.

      "body": "<p>Well over six feet tall, hair and beard tangled and long, Alan Moore strides through his home town of Northampton like its secret king. His one and only novel, Voice of the Fire, explores the history of this settlement at England's geographic heart. It finishes with Moore himself stumbling into the night, wild-eyed and sickened after magically conjuring a gruesome ending for the book. \"I was finding my territory, identifying myself with it, trying to become it in some mad way,\" he says. </p> <p>Moore, 47, is better known as modern comics' writing king, transfiguring the medium with Watchmen (1987), set in a densely re-imagined America in which superheroes are atom bomb-like political pawns. It was an instant bestseller, optioned by Terry Gilliam until he acknowledged its unfilmable depths. During the brief vogue for \"adult\" comics that followed, Moore worked in Hollywood with Malcolm McLaren, and, at a comics convention, was hysterically mobbed. </p> <p>The attention repulsed him, and despite being on the cusp of fame, he withdrew in order to begin several massively ambitious new comics outside the mainstream. Among them were a fractal maths-based examination of everyday life called Big Numbers, and From Hell, about Jack the Ripper. All these projects mysteriously stumbled. There were rumours that the FBI was chasing Big Numbers' artist, that he'd fled into the night on seeing the script's terrifying difficulty. Moore's strange success on literature's margin had crumbled. </p> <p>Recently, though, a resurgence has begun. From Hell took 10 years to complete in serialised form but is now about to be published as a book. The story has drawn in new fans, among them Iain Sinclair, who admired it at length in Lights out for the Territory, his investigation into London arcana, and Oliver Stone, who bought the film rights. </p> <p>Moore's take on the Ripper (here, Queen Victoria's physician, Sir William Gull) and his interest in the veins of history, myth and male destruction that spread from the murders, may not survive the transfer to Hollywood. Filming has just started in Prague, with Johnny Depp as middle-aged cockney Ripper-hunter Inspector Abberline, and Nigel Hawthorne as Gull. </p> <p>Moore is too busy with a sudden stream of new comics to worry - five a month, a pace that would break most writers. Between issues, the Tate has asked him to contribute to its Blake retrospective next year. It's only right. For as he affably chats over lunch in Northampton, he reveals the secret of his renewed success. Like Blake (and other authors, including William Burroughs and Clive Barker), Moore says that, when he writes now, it's magic. </p> <p>\"I can remember the exact panel during the writing of From Hell when I became interested in magic,\" he says. \"Gull says that one place that gods inarguably exist is in the human mind. I wrote that sentence, and noticed the word 'inarguable', which is quite a big word, and that was the beginning of the end. I thought, 'I can't see why that isn't true. And if it is true, then I'm probably going to have to change the whole of my life to fit around it.' \" </p> <p>It was on Moore's 40th birthday that he made that switch - using drugs and ritual and imaginative concentration to, he believes, conjure gods and ask them for ideas. \"I told friends they ought to be keeping an eye on me. I had to really think - how will people know if I've gone mad? The only criteria I could set was, am I as creative? Am I as productive? And my creativity has gone into hack hyperdrive, where you can write five books a month, and they're all good, and you don't even get that tired. </p> <p>\"Writing is like a conscious trance now. I see imagination as a landscape, and if I'm imagining something that somebody else has imagined before, I go further. I might focus on a flavour, or a scent, then the conceptual detail sharpens from the fog, and I write. I can move at blinding speed from concept to concept, often without drugs and ritual. </p> <p>\"Any idea I derive from magic that doesn't have an application in the material world, I discard. If the ideas are good, it doesn't matter if the gods are there, does it? If I act like they are, I get a response.\" </p> <p>Moore sees magic as a system to understand the \"cold mechanics\" of an area beyond scientific reach. But he knows he is open to ridicule. \"I don't think many Booker writers would want to risk talking like this. It's like Brian Eno said about artists - they're superstitiously terrified of their own talent. If you really start thinking about 'inspiration', it's uncomfortably close to being spooky. It can make you sound silly.\" </p> <p>Moore, by contrast, thinks of his attempt to map the imagination as a sensible survival tool in a world where we now spend so much time in \"unreal\" TV and virtual space, and information density is reaching \"boiling point\", prefiguring a post-industrial, post-rational age to come. \"I'm trying to work out the rules. I'm lucky to be a writer now.\" </p> <p>Moore might not have thought so 10 years back, when his most cherished projects, Big Numbers especially, crashed and burned in an extremely real collision of collapsing publishers, absconding artists, and an emotional and financial battering. From Hell is the 572-page, profound monster he pulled from the wreckage. \"I wanted to extend the normal way we investigate murder in fiction,\" he remembers of its 1988 beginnings. \"I'd read the title of Douglas Adams's book The Dirk Gently Holistic Detective Agency, and I thought that sounded like a good approach. You wouldn't just solve the crime - you'd solve the entire universe the crime existed in. I wanted to follow the threads of murder to their end.\" </p> <p>From Hell accordingly operates as a horror story, a conspiracy theory, a thesis on how the 1880s and the Ripper crimes bled into the next 100 years of history and myth, and a re-creation of the daily lives of his prostitute victims. Its centrepiece, though, is the chapter-long chopping-up in her room of the last of them, Marie Kelly. \"I dreaded writing that,\" Moore recalls. \"I knew I'd have to spend so long in that awful little room. You've got to be aware of all the details. You're aware it's incredibly hot, because the fire melted the kettle in the hearth. You're aware it took him two hours. You're aware of the autopsy photographs, and the child-like absorption they show. And you start to think: what would be going through someone's mind for two hours, while they're cutting people's insides and arranging them round a room? I don't know if that is what it would be like. But it felt real to me.\" </p> <p>From Hell's sympathy stays with the victims, though. On its last page, Moore watches a stripper at the Whitechapel pub where the prostitutes drank. \"That's what From Hell's about in the end - a pallid little Goth dancing for men down from the City, with pictures of the victims on the walls. It's about how vulnerable we make women, and why.\" </p> <p>Another recent Moore comic, The Birth Caul, also criticises society, but ends more optimistically.

      "bodyText": "Well over six feet tall, hair and beard tangled and long, Alan Moore strides through his home town of Northampton like its secret king. His one and only novel, Voice of the Fire, explores the history of this settlement at England's geographic heart. It finishes with Moore himself stumbling into the night, wild-eyed and sickened after magically conjuring a gruesome ending for the book. \"I was finding my territory, identifying myself with it, trying to become it in some mad way,\" he says. Moore, 47, is better known as modern comics' writing king, transfiguring the medium with Watchmen (1987), set in a densely re-imagined America in which superheroes are atom bomb-like political pawns. It was an instant bestseller, optioned by Terry Gilliam until he acknowledged its unfilmable depths. During the brief vogue for \"adult\" comics that followed, Moore worked in Hollywood with Malcolm McLaren, and, at a comics convention, was hysterically mobbed. The attention repulsed him, and despite being on the cusp of fame, he withdrew in order to begin several massively ambitious new comics outside the mainstream. Among them were a fractal maths-based examination of everyday life called Big Numbers, and From Hell, about Jack the Ripper. All these projects mysteriously stumbled. There were rumours that the FBI was chasing Big Numbers' artist, that he'd fled into the night on seeing the script's terrifying difficulty. Moore's strange success on literature's margin had crumbled. Recently, though, a resurgence has begun. From Hell took 10 years to complete in serialised form but is now about to be published as a book. The story has drawn in new fans, among them Iain Sinclair, who admired it at length in Lights out for the Territory, his investigation into London arcana, and Oliver Stone, who bought the film rights. Moore's take on the Ripper (here, Queen Victoria's physician, Sir William Gull) and his interest in the veins of history, myth and male destruction that spread from the murders, may not survive the transfer to Hollywood. Filming has just started in Prague, with Johnny Depp as middle-aged cockney Ripper-hunter Inspector Abberline, and Nigel Hawthorne as Gull. Moore is too busy with a sudden stream of new comics to worry - five a month, a pace that would break most writers. Between issues, the Tate has asked him to contribute to its Blake retrospective next year. It's only right. For as he affably chats over lunch in Northampton, he reveals the secret of his renewed success. Like Blake (and other authors, including William Burroughs and Clive Barker), Moore says that, when he writes now, it's magic. \"I can remember the exact panel during the writing of From Hell when I became interested in magic,\" he says. \"Gull says that one place that gods inarguably exist is in the human mind. I wrote that sentence, and noticed the word 'inarguable', which is quite a big word, and that was the beginning of the end. I thought, 'I can't see why that isn't true. And if it is true, then I'm probably going to have to change the whole of my life to fit around it.' \" It was on Moore's 40th birthday that he made that switch - using drugs and ritual and imaginative concentration to, he believes, conjure gods and ask them for ideas. \"I told friends they ought to be keeping an eye on me. I had to really think - how will people know if I've gone mad? The only criteria I could set was, am I as creative? Am I as productive? And my creativity has gone into hack hyperdrive, where you can write five books a month, and they're all good, and you don't even get that tired. \"Writing is like a conscious trance now. I see imagination as a landscape, and if I'm imagining something that somebody else has imagined before, I go further. I might focus on a flavour, or a scent, then the conceptual detail sharpens from the fog, and I write. I can move at blinding speed from concept to concept, often without drugs and ritual. \"Any idea I derive from magic that doesn't have an application in the material world, I discard. If the ideas are good, it doesn't matter if the gods are there, does it? If I act like they are, I get a response.\" Moore sees magic as a system to understand the \"cold mechanics\" of an area beyond scientific reach. But he knows he is open to ridicule. \"I don't think many Booker writers would want to risk talking like this. It's like Brian Eno said about artists - they're superstitiously terrified of their own talent. If you really start thinking about 'inspiration', it's uncomfortably close to being spooky. It can make you sound silly.\" Moore, by contrast, thinks of his attempt to map the imagination as a sensible survival tool in a world where we now spend so much time in \"unreal\" TV and virtual space, and information density is reaching \"boiling point\", prefiguring a post-industrial, post-rational age to come. \"I'm trying to work out the rules. I'm lucky to be a writer now.\" Moore might not have thought so 10 years back, when his most cherished projects, Big Numbers especially, crashed and burned in an extremely real collision of collapsing publishers, absconding artists, and an emotional and financial battering. From Hell is the 572-page, profound monster he pulled from the wreckage. \"I wanted to extend the normal way we investigate murder in fiction,\" he remembers of its 1988 beginnings. \"I'd read the title of Douglas Adams's book The Dirk Gently Holistic Detective Agency, and I thought that sounded like a good approach. You wouldn't just solve the crime - you'd solve the entire universe the crime existed in. I wanted to follow the threads of murder to their end.\" From Hell accordingly operates as a horror story, a conspiracy theory, a thesis on how the 1880s and the Ripper crimes bled into the next 100 years of history and myth, and a re-creation of the daily lives of his prostitute victims. Its centrepiece, though, is the chapter-long chopping-up in her room of the last of them, Marie Kelly. \"I dreaded writing that,\" Moore recalls. \"I knew I'd have to spend so long in that awful little room. You've got to be aware of all the details. You're aware it's incredibly hot, because the fire melted the kettle in the hearth. You're aware it took him two hours. You're aware of the autopsy photographs, and the child-like absorption they show. And you start to think: what would be going through someone's mind for two hours, while they're cutting people's insides and arranging them round a room? I don't know if that is what it would be like. But it felt real to me.\" From Hell's sympathy stays with the victims, though. On its last page, Moore watches a stripper at the Whitechapel pub where the prostitutes drank. \"That's what From Hell's about in the end - a pallid little Goth dancing for men down from the City, with pictures of the victims on the walls. It's about how vulnerable we make women, and why.\" Another recent Moore comic, The Birth Caul, also criticises society, but ends more optimistically. Rewinding the life of a man not unlike Moore, tearing away the compromises he's accrued, it's about our potential. \"One of the prettiest things Aleister Crowley ever said is, 'Every man and woman is a star.' I believe that,\" Moore says with passion. \"In the human mind, the number of possible connections that can be made between neurons greatly exceeds the number of atoms in the universe. And most people watch EastEnders. I didn't start with any obvious genetic or financial benefits. I was not promising. I believe anybody could do this if they believed they could. We could be so much more potent than we are.\" \u0095 From Hell is published by Knockabout, price \u00a324.99.",

More than 130 children were killed and more than 4,500 seriously injured while walking or cycling in 1998, the most recent year for which figures are available.</p> <p>The journey to school provides one of the best illustrations of the potential contribution of walking to sustainable transport policies. On weekday mornings during term time, at the peak hour of 8.50am, nearly one in five cars on urban roads is ferrying children to school. This is the result of a near doubling in the proportion of journeys to school by car over the last decade, from 16% to 29%. The increase in car use corresponds mainly to a reduction in walking. Children's health and independence have been the losers along with the environment. Only one in eleven primary pupils now goes to school unaccompanied, while 10 years ago one in five did.</p> <p>The school travel advisory group, established by government to advise on how to reduce the number of car journeys to school, recommends a return by 2010 to the level of walking, cycling and bus journeys to school in the mid-80s. This would mean 80% walking, cycling and bus use for primary pupils compared with 63% now and 90% for secondary pupils compared with 79% now. Needless to say the government has not endorsed these targets.</p> <p>There is no difficulty in resolving the paradox of Britain's very bad record of child pedestrian injuries and its declining walk rate to school. One of the most effective ways of reducing road accidents and encouraging walking is by reducing speeds; 20mph zones, which combine the lower speed limit with traffic calming measures, reduce the overall accident rate by 60% and the child pedestrian accident rate in particular by 70%.</p> <p>A 10-year programme of 20mph zones targeted at the 3,000 most deprived neighbourhoods in England identi fied by the Social Exclusion Unit, for example, would cost about \u00a3500m: small beer. There are nine \"home zone\" pilots that go a step further with a complete makeover in street design to create a safe environment for pedestrians and children.</p> <p>If the government is going to meet its own target of reducing the number of child pedestrian deaths and serious injuries by 50% by 2010 it will have to get serious about walking. In addition to reducing speeds, feasible measures include better pavements, lighting and safer road crossings. Most are small and local. Individually they will not grab the national headlines. But taken together they would slowly and surely challenge our car culture. And that would be better for everyone.</p> <p>\u0095 Tony Grayling is a transport specialist at the Institute for Public Policy Research.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:t.grayling@ippr.org.uk\">Tony Grayling</a></p>",

The school travel advisory group, established by government to advise on how to reduce the number of car journeys to school, recommends a return by 2010 to the level of walking, cycling and bus journeys to school in the mid-80s. This would mean 80% walking, cycling and bus use for primary pupils compared with 63% now and 90% for secondary pupils compared with 79% now. Needless to say the government has not endorsed these targets. There is no difficulty in resolving the paradox of Britain's very bad record of child pedestrian injuries and its declining walk rate to school. One of the most effective ways of reducing road accidents and encouraging walking is by reducing speeds; 20mph zones, which combine the lower speed limit with traffic calming measures, reduce the overall accident rate by 60% and the child pedestrian accident rate in particular by 70%. A 10-year programme of 20mph zones targeted at the 3,000 most deprived neighbourhoods in England identi fied by the Social Exclusion Unit, for example, would cost about \u00a3500m: small beer. There are nine \"home zone\" pilots that go a step further with a complete makeover in street design to create a safe environment for pedestrians and children. If the government is going to meet its own target of reducing the number of child pedestrian deaths and serious injuries by 50% by 2010 it will have to get serious about walking. In addition to reducing speeds, feasible measures include better pavements, lighting and safer road crossings. Most are small and local. Individually they will not grab the national headlines. But taken together they would slowly and surely challenge our car culture. And that would be better for everyone. \u0095 Tony Grayling is a transport specialist at the Institute for Public Policy Research. Tony Grayling",

It was never going to reach a mass audience (though many serious newspapers and magazines would be pleased to reach its audience of 1.5m). It involved thousands of hours of research, a hundred hours of filming and, in Peter Taylor's case, a lifetime of contacts and reading. It is no coincidence that the other outstanding documentary series of the past five years, Norma Percy's The Death of Yugoslavia, was also commissioned and shown by the BBC. Every time a Murdoch tabloid sneers at the BBC, remember these two series. There is still such a thing as serious television journalism in this country and it appears to be increasingly pointless to expect it any more from ITV.

The Guardian and its sister paper, the Observer, are both being pursued by the police to hand over material which might incriminate the former MI5 officer, David Shayler. The former head of MI5, Stella Rimington, is being demonised for writing an account of her time in the security services.

      "bodyText": "Andrew Faulds, the former actor and Labour MP, died yesterday aged 77. Mr Faulds represented Warley East in the West Midlands from 1966 to 1997. Last night veteran Labour MP Tony Benn described him as \"very direct and blunt in his manner, passionately in favour of the European Union and a strong supporter of the Arab cause. \"He spoke his mind and didn't much care what people thought about it. He had very definite opinions and was inclined to explode with anger. As a result he was a memorable figure and quite a character in the House of Commons.\" The assistant general secretary of the Labour Party, Phil Murphy, described him as \"one of the great personalities in the House of Commons\". \"He was never a predictable character and that added to his attraction. He was also a loyal servant of the Labour party.\" Mr Faulds appeared in several TV productions and one of his best known roles was as Jet Morgan in the 50s radio series Journey into Space. He also played Carver Doone in the TV series Lorna Doone and starred in the film Jason and the Argonauts as well as numerous Ken Russell films. He entered parliament in 1966, representing the now defunct Smethwick constituency before Warley East. He kept his Equity card and was in demand for TV voice-overs. In April 1967, he attacked Norman St John-Stevas for discussing abortion \"when he has not the capacity to put a bun in anybody's oven\". In 1982, Mr Faulds was suspended from the Commons for five days for insisting on speaking out against the Falklands war. Fervently pro-Arab and anti-Zionist in the Middle East, he was sacked as arts spokesman by Harold Wilson for a quip about a Labour MP as better off representing the Knesset. Although reappointed as arts spokesman in 1979, he was again sacked by Michael Foot in May 1982 for voting against the Falklands war. Mr Faulds leaves a wife, Bunty, a daughter and two grandchildren.",

      "bodyText": "The Ethiopian prime minister yesterday declared his country's two-year border war with Eritrea over, saying that Ethiopia had recaptured all the disputed land which Eritrea occupied by force in May 1998. Meles Zenawi was quoted on Ethiopian state television as saying, \"The war against Eritrea has been accomplished in victory.\" His announcement came after two days of peace talks between the two sides in Algeria, during which an accord for implementing a peace deal agreed more than a year ago was finally struck. But an Eritrean government spokesman, Yermane Gebremeskel, said: \"They [Ethiopia] cannot say the war is over when they still occupy Eritrean territory,\" referring to the thousands of square miles of southern Eritrea that Ethiopia has occupied since launching a massive offensive on May 12. Eritrea says that Ethiopia must withdraw all its forces to their pre-May 1998 positions before Eritrea will consider the war over. But despite Eritrean reluctance to confirm an end to the war, Ethiopia is in the military ascendancy and if it is prepared to withdraw its forces from undisputed Eritrean territory then Eritrea is unlikely to reignite the conflict. Ethiopia and its former ally, Eritrea, came to blows in May 1998 when Eritrea invaded parts of northern Ethiopia. Two years of offensive and counter-offensive followed in which first world war-style trench battles were fought and in which hundreds died for every metre of territory gained. But last month's offensive changed that as Ethiopian troops broke through the lines and advanced rapidly into western and southern Eritrea. Hundreds of thousands of civilians fled. The peace deal calls for both sides to withdraw to pre-war positions and for an independent commission to delineate their common border. A United Nations World Food Programme spokesperson said that if farmers did not get home and plant their crops as soon as possible the harvest would fail, leaving millions in need of food aid. Ethiopia's declaration last night is a clear sign that Eritrea is offering little resistance to Ethiopia's demands at the negotiating table. According to western diplomats in the Eritrean capital Asmara, Eritrea had little will to fight once Ethiopian troops broke through its lines and into Eritrean territory. After Ethiopian diplomats in Algeria had assuaged Eritrean fears that Ethiopia wished to conquer the entire country, Eritrea would have seen little sense in continuing a war of attrition, they said. The popular Eritrean government will sell the deal to their people as a victory, they predicted.",

(Terrible? He would defend them, it's only the rotting flesh they inhabit that stinks.) The olfactory habits of maggots may sound arcane, but working out how maggots sniff out food could have profound implications for agriculture, as well as furthering our understanding of how our ability to smell actually works. </p> <p>Cobb, who is at the Laboratoire d'Ecologie in Paris, normally studies adult maggots in the form of fruit flies. \"I was always very snotty about maggots because they don't do much. They're nothing but a moving bag of genes that has to eat. You can get flies to mate and learn.\" Cobb then realised that the maggot's very simplicity means it is an easier system to understand. </p> <p>\"They have a mindless existence: you starve them and put them in front of a smell and they move towards it.\" What better, if smell in maggots is what excites you? </p> <p>Now that the genome of fruit flies has been unraveled, it's been discovered that they have 50 different genes which code for 1,200 nerves used to detect smell. But the maggot has only 21 nerves for smell and no one knows which genes are involved. What scientists do know is that none of the genes that allow a fly to develop a sense of smell are used by the maggot. This suggests that all maggots may have the same olfactory system whether they are a blow fly larva or stag beetle grub which developed several million years ago. </p> <p>How we all smell is a subject that has intrigued the best and brightest minds throughout history. The Greek philosopher Democritus, who conceived the idea of atoms, thought sweet smells were produced by round atoms and sharp scents by pointy ones and, according to Cobb, our understanding hasn't advanced much. </p> <p>In the 1660s a Dutch scientist, Jan Swammerdam, tried to figure out how the maggot, this sack of jelly with a mini nervous system and no discernible nose, could smell. His perception is still thought to be astounding more than 400 years later. Maggots have a dorsal organ on their head which is covered in a mucous layer that traps smells. They have proteins that bind to smells. \"They protect and carry them like a molecular chaperone,\" says Cobb, transporting them to receptor cells. But it is not known how these alleged receptor cells do the business of smelling, or even what they might look like. </p> <p>Apparently fruit fly larvae can detect 45 out of 52 smells they were given, and onion fly maggots can smell 27 odours found in onions. The test is to put a bunch of larvae in a dish with a smell at one end and count how many gravitate towards the smell: a scientific version of the Guinness ad's Cuban snail race where the protagonists slide speedily towards an overturned pint. </p> <p>It is hardly surprising that research on the olfactory ability of the cabbage root fly shows that they can smell cabbages. The trouble is, it has proved impossible to tell if the maggots are reacting to all the smells, or if they can distinguish between them. </p> <p>But why should maggots be able to smell anyway? Mother flies lay their eggs on prime food, be it a rotten apple or a decomposing animal, and all the maggot has to do is eat. Cobb doesn't believe the maggots' ability is an evolutionary hang-up; they have been around for 40 million years and if they haven't got rid of their sense of smell by now, there must be a reason. One explanation could be that if a maggot falls off its food, it could use its sense of smell to negotiate its way back. </p> <p>Another is that smell would allow maggot to discriminate between shades of decomposition. Fruit and flesh don't decompose at the same rate, so smell could help them avoid toxic substances that build up in some areas and not others. </p> <p>Forensic science relies on being able to pinpoint death by the number, type and age of maggots in the corpse: different species of maggot are attracted by specific rates of decay which they might be able to determine through their sense of smell. </p> <p> S mell may also help maggots to help us inadvertently. Henry VIII used them to heal his ulcers, and the Seaman's Mission in Greenwich also employed them for a time. The ability of maggots to facilitate wound healing was first noticed on the battlefield when maggots accidentally infected wounds. During the American Civil War, a confederate officer remarked: \"I have frequently seen neglected wounds filled with maggots... as far as my experience extends, these worms only destroy dead tissues, and do not injure specifically the well parts.\" The maggots might use smell to discriminate between healthy and rotting tissue. </p> <p>An alternative idea is that the food the larva feeds on could influence where and on what the adult lays eggs. Once the larvae have reached a certain size, they form pupae. Inside the cocoon they dissolve completely; this molecular soup reforms as an adult fly. And yet some memories of smells learnt by the larvae are retained as adults. This seems remarkable, but the brain of the maggot is the only organ which does not dissolve and it may be that neuronal patterns laid down in the brain are preserved in the adult. But as Cobb says, these explanations are \"all rather sad. It's junior school nature study rather than science. No one knows why maggots smell.\" </p> <p>The research might help farmers: it might be possible to find a substance that smells so attractive to maggots, they would migrate out of their preferred food, cabbage roots, in the case of the cabbage root fly which can devastate whole fields, and could be trapped. </p> <p>As for Cobb, he is following in Swammerdam's footsteps: the Dutch scientist studied the cheese skipper fly which infests cheese. </p> <p>\"These mites, when they are about to become nymphs, generally desert the cheese in which they had hitherto lived, by leaping up and down, till they find, if possible, a more favourable situation.\" </p> <p>The maggots hold their tail in their mouth and bounce. By letting go of their tails they can jump about two feet. In Corsica and Sardinia, cheese riddled with maggots is considered a great delicacy, though not recommended by the medical establishment. </p> <p>Recently Cobb attempted to cultivate these maggots by feeding them Camembert.

Peter Bongers and Frank Beli\u00ebn have been working on a project called Living Tomorrow for a decade, and last week they opened their second futuristic home on the outskirts of Brussels. Now they're planning a series across the globe, starting in Amsterdam in 2002. \"We think that if a project like this can work in Brussels then it can work anywhere,\" says Bongers with a grin. </p> <p> \"We're also working on a Living Tomorrow in Berlin and, in the near future, we aim to develop projects in the United States and China as well. Our ambition is to become world number one in a market that doesn't really exist at present.\" Bongers hopes the development of the London version will parallel the one in the Netherlands. \"We are very very close to a deal in London, near the Millennium Dome,\" he says. Whether the Dome will still be there is another matter, but Living Tomorrow isn't aimed at passing tourists so much as groups of professionals who are given customised tours.</p> <p> The future homes can't handle more than about 200,000-300,000 visitors a year, and there isn't room for all the people who want to see them. Bongers and Beli\u00ebn started their project in 1991, and Microsoft boss Bill Gates - well known for his own futuristic home near Seattle, Washington - opened their first house of the future in 1995. Living Tomorrow 2 (see <a href=\"http://www.livtom.com\" target=\"_new\">www.livtom.com</a>) is also scheduled to last five years: even though the installation is continuously upgraded, the pace of development is so rapid that the future soon goes out of date.</p> <p> The house - which is a house, a laboratory and a showroom - covers 3,700 square metres, including a lecture theatre and meeting rooms. It cost Euro 14.5m (\u00a39m) to put together, and there's another \u0080 8m (\u00a35m) in the \"media budget\". Even if it attracts the expected 200,000 visitors a year for five years, that's \u00a314 a head: not cheap. About half of the products in the house are already on sale, the other half are prototypes and research products. The project's 96 commercial partners (four places are still available) use the house to find out how their products can work together, as well as for marketing purposes. For example, MXK (Moulinex-Krups) had to develop ways to network its microwave oven so that it could be controlled from the house's kitchen computer. </p> <p> Of course, not all the partners are developing electronics products. A lot of them are working with paints, tiles and other building materials. Heating, plumbing, and waste disposal problems need more than microchips. Nonetheless, it is possible to apply electronics in interesting ways. Sleepy's Ergosleep bed, for example, is computer controlled: it raises and lowers a series of slats to match the bed to the <a href=\"http://www.sleepy.be\" target=\"_new\">sleeper's profile</a>.</p> <p> Obviously the whole house is wired to the internet, and Joachim De Vos, the project's information and communications technology manager, says everything is done using IP, the internet protocol. The television sets, telephones and computers don't have separate connections as they would today: everything is delivered via the net. </p> <p> De Vos says the problem with using IP is that it has no \"quality of service\" provision that would enable different traffic to be given priority: you might be unable to phone the police because the TV set is using all the bandwidth to download a movie. However, he says this will start to change with the next version of the protocol, IPv6. The house is currently controlled from a series of small wall-mounted touch-sensitive panels with LCD screens, but De Vos says he expects more use to be made of hand-held personal digital assistants (PDAs) such as the Palm range. </p> <p> The result is not very futuristic from some points of view - it's almost within reach of the rich, and beyond the wildest dreams, or needs, of the majority of the earth's inhabitants. But as the novelist, William Gibson, once observed: \" The future is already here: it's just unevenly distributed.\"</p>",

Bongers and Beli\u00ebn started their project in 1991, and Microsoft boss Bill Gates - well known for his own futuristic home near Seattle, Washington - opened their first house of the future in 1995. Living Tomorrow 2 (see www.livtom.com) is also scheduled to last five years: even though the installation is continuously upgraded, the pace of development is so rapid that the future soon goes out of date. The house - which is a house, a laboratory and a showroom - covers 3,700 square metres, including a lecture theatre and meeting rooms. It cost Euro 14.5m (\u00a39m) to put together, and there's another \u0080 8m (\u00a35m) in the \"media budget\". Even if it attracts the expected 200,000 visitors a year for five years, that's \u00a314 a head: not cheap. About half of the products in the house are already on sale, the other half are prototypes and research products. The project's 96 commercial partners (four places are still available) use the house to find out how their products can work together, as well as for marketing purposes. For example, MXK (Moulinex-Krups) had to develop ways to network its microwave oven so that it could be controlled from the house's kitchen computer. Of course, not all the partners are developing electronics products. A lot of them are working with paints, tiles and other building materials. Heating, plumbing, and waste disposal problems need more than microchips. Nonetheless, it is possible to apply electronics in interesting ways. Sleepy's Ergosleep bed, for example, is computer controlled: it raises and lowers a series of slats to match the bed to the sleeper's profile. Obviously the whole house is wired to the internet, and Joachim De Vos, the project's information and communications technology manager, says everything is done using IP, the internet protocol. The television sets, telephones and computers don't have separate connections as they would today: everything is delivered via the net. De Vos says the problem with using IP is that it has no \"quality of service\" provision that would enable different traffic to be given priority: you might be unable to phone the police because the TV set is using all the bandwidth to download a movie. However, he says this will start to change with the next version of the protocol, IPv6. The house is currently controlled from a series of small wall-mounted touch-sensitive panels with LCD screens, but De Vos says he expects more use to be made of hand-held personal digital assistants (PDAs) such as the Palm range. The result is not very futuristic from some points of view - it's almost within reach of the rich, and beyond the wildest dreams, or needs, of the majority of the earth's inhabitants. But as the novelist, William Gibson, once observed: \" The future is already here: it's just unevenly distributed.\"",

And performance can still be significantly impaired the day after heavy drinking. </p> <p>Howland's research began because of a general interest in the causes of accidents and injury. \"I thought there might be unexplored sources of injury and system error due to low doses of various agents,\" he says. That could mean simple tiredness, cold medicines, antihistamines and painkillers as well as mild use of alcohol or drugs. \"There are many people exposed to these low levels, so even if the individual risk is low, it can add up to as much as the risk from a few people receiving high levels.\" </p> <p>He searched the scientific literature, but failed to find any reason why the US department of transportation had set the blood alcohol concentration limit at 0.04% for people operating commercial ships. \"We couldn't see that much research had been done to detect whether 0.04 was a safe level. We're hoping our results will cause people to re-visit that figure: there should be a scientific basis for the limits.\" </p> <p>So he gathered a group of engineering students from the Massachussetts Marine Academy, and made them perform an emergency routine on the academy's engine room simulator. The next day he separated them into two groups, and gave each group something to drink. No one knew what they had drunk, but one group had received an alcohol dose equivalent to a couple of beers, while the others got placebos. Then he asked them to perform another emergency simulation. \"The effect was enormous,\" Howland says. The students with a couple of beers inside them took twice as long to perform the task as they had done the day before. </p> <p>But, Howland adds, the most frightening result was not that the students' perfor mance was so poor after such a low dose of alcohol, but that they didn't even realise it. </p> <p>\"They're not sensing the fact that they are dosed, and they don't notice that their performance isn't as good as it was before. That's the critical thing: people can't voluntarily remove themselves from operating a system if they don't know they're impaired. And if they don't know, and they're not acting impaired, no one else is going to remove them.\" </p> <p>He has repeated the experiment on a simulator for deck officers - the kind of job that Hazelwood failed to do.

      "bodyText": "A leading anti-terrorist magistrate has written to France's three mobile telephone operators to complain that their inability to provide police with prompt information on suspects' calls is hindering criminal investigations. \"The slowness of your services either reduces our chances of success or delays the arrest of people who are suspected of serious crimes, with consequent risks to the population in general,\" wrote judge Gilbert Thiel, who is investigating a series of Breton separatist attacks. The judge's irate letter to operators SFR, Bouygues and the partly state-owned France Telecom, complains that the three firms routinely take between one and five months to come up with potentially crucial data on where exactly a mobile phone call was made. Mobile records, which can allow police to place suspects near a crime scene or link them to other individuals, are becoming valuable sources of evidence in France, where a new mobile phone is being bought every seven seconds. Investigators traced Sid Ahmed Rezala, the suspected murderer of British student Isabel Peake, by monitoring the mobile phone he was using at a hide-out in Lisbon, Portugal.",

The public has a week to return the tear-off reply slips with their views on what NHS money should be spent on. The Guardian asked NHS staff for their three wishes for the NHS: </p> <p><strong> David Polson, 43, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist</strong> </p> <p>I have two wishes: more money and more staff. We can't improve the service by penny pinching and we have known that for a long time. Medical and support staff are leaving in large numbers: money could stop them. I don't have a third wish. Everyone who works here will tell you the same. Money and recruitment is all we need to solve the mess. </p> <p><strong> Andrea Duxbury, 35, staff nurse</strong> </p> <p>Patients should be allowed to choose where they are treated. If someone is sent to a hospital in London, for example, they should be able to say, \"no, I've heard it's rubbish\" and opt for Leeds. Second, we need more staff. Staffing levels are bad everywhere you go. Then we need better working conditions. Nurses' hours are not being adapted to suit working mothers. A lot of people are tired on the job. </p> <p><strong> Joe Murphy, 38, senior operating practitioner</strong> </p> <p>We need a national register for operating department practitioners so that assistants to surgeons and anaesthetists are made accountable. The government is planning to do this in September 2001. I want to see an end to the shortage of critical care beds. If an emergency patient comes in and there isn't a bed, we are forced to postpone surgery. Communication between staff at different levels must be improved for better continuity of care. </p> <p><strong> Jean Jellicoe, 45, pharmaceutical technician</strong> </p> <p>Staffing needs to be improved. Pharmaceutical technicians are leaving the NHS in droves and we aren't attracting recruits. There aren't enough student technicians to fill the places. We need bigger pharmaceutical departments with more space for preparing prescriptions. We need time. Staff are going to private care homes because here they don't have the time to interact with patients properly. </p> <p><strong> Sarah Haley, 23, junior doctor</strong> </p> <p>My main wish would be to cut waiting lists for residential care and nursing homes. Patients who are fit to be discharged from hospital face an eight week wait for secondary care. Doctors need better access to test results. Patients who fall just short of emergency status are having very long waits for scan results. Hospitals need to be better designed. A lot of wards have beds so close together there is not enough room to manoeuvre round them with the curtains drawn. </p> <p><strong> Daz George, 27, porter</strong> </p> <p>First, morale needs a boost. Among porters, morale is subzero. There are now three hospitals on this site and our workload has doubled but we are short of men. We need more equipment: accident and emergency trolleys and specialised wheelchairs. Third, porters need better pay. </p> <p> Angelique Chrisafis interviewed staff at Hope hospital, Salford, Greater Manchester</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday distributed 12m leaflets in hospitals, doctors' surgeries and supermarkets, asking people to list their three priorities for the NHS. The public has a week to return the tear-off reply slips with their views on what NHS money should be spent on. The Guardian asked NHS staff for their three wishes for the NHS: David Polson, 43, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist I have two wishes: more money and more staff. We can't improve the service by penny pinching and we have known that for a long time. Medical and support staff are leaving in large numbers: money could stop them. I don't have a third wish. Everyone who works here will tell you the same. Money and recruitment is all we need to solve the mess. Andrea Duxbury, 35, staff nurse Patients should be allowed to choose where they are treated. If someone is sent to a hospital in London, for example, they should be able to say, \"no, I've heard it's rubbish\" and opt for Leeds. Second, we need more staff. Staffing levels are bad everywhere you go. Then we need better working conditions. Nurses' hours are not being adapted to suit working mothers. A lot of people are tired on the job. Joe Murphy, 38, senior operating practitioner We need a national register for operating department practitioners so that assistants to surgeons and anaesthetists are made accountable. The government is planning to do this in September 2001. I want to see an end to the shortage of critical care beds. If an emergency patient comes in and there isn't a bed, we are forced to postpone surgery. Communication between staff at different levels must be improved for better continuity of care. Jean Jellicoe, 45, pharmaceutical technician Staffing needs to be improved. Pharmaceutical technicians are leaving the NHS in droves and we aren't attracting recruits. There aren't enough student technicians to fill the places. We need bigger pharmaceutical departments with more space for preparing prescriptions. We need time. Staff are going to private care homes because here they don't have the time to interact with patients properly. Sarah Haley, 23, junior doctor My main wish would be to cut waiting lists for residential care and nursing homes. Patients who are fit to be discharged from hospital face an eight week wait for secondary care. Doctors need better access to test results. Patients who fall just short of emergency status are having very long waits for scan results. Hospitals need to be better designed. A lot of wards have beds so close together there is not enough room to manoeuvre round them with the curtains drawn. Daz George, 27, porter First, morale needs a boost. Among porters, morale is subzero. There are now three hospitals on this site and our workload has doubled but we are short of men. We need more equipment: accident and emergency trolleys and specialised wheelchairs. Third, porters need better pay.

In a savage attack on the cost and alleged ineffectuality of Gordon Brown's flagship programme, the Tories' welfare spokesman, David Willetts, also accused ministers of \"fiddling their own figures\" to cover up the fact that the true cost of finding a job for a lone parent may be as high as \u00a322,500, not \u00a31,388, as officially claimed. Using an analysis of New Deal pilot schemes produced for the Department of Social Security, Mr Willetts, the brains behind the new Tory pension plans, yesterday made two further damning claims: \u0095 that 34% of lone parents involved found jobs through friends and relatives, compared with 1% who credited the government's \"personal adviser\" system; \u0095 that lone parents on income support were slightly more likely to find jobs in areas without a New Deal for lone parents (NDLP) scheme than inside such a programme. Ministers, led by Mr Brown, Alistair Darling, the social security secretary, and his predecessor, the champion of lone parent working, Harriet Harman, have defended the New Deal, though Mr Willetts, an ex-Treasury official, accuses them of withholding key figures to bolster their case. Mr Darling told MPs in March that \"the number of lone parents on income support was 3.3% lower than it would have been without the NDLP\", implying that they had found jobs. Mr Willetts claims that in 18% of cases the reason for this was the admission of undeclared cohabitation or informal \"re-partnering\" - a traditional bone of contention because of \"social security snoopers\" checking up on claimants. That makes it the most effective part of the scheme, an accidental throwback to old-style \"snooper\" tactics as officialdom focuses on individual cases, Mr Willetts believes. \"When Alistair Darling takes credit for an additional 3.3% movement off income support, he is referring to a higher rate of detected re-partnering. The main effect of the scheme appears to have been the discovery of partners previously unknown to the benefits agency,\" his pamphlet, A Raw Deal for Lone Parents, says. Last night independent academic analysts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Policy Studies Institute conceded that the beneficial effects on the 410,000 lone parents in the DSS target group had been small, but said it was still \"early days\". Both thinktanks are doing their own research and warned against rushing to judgment simply on pilot schemes launched before the NDLP went nationwide. Mr Willetts was unapologetic. Faced with the flood of extra public spending that Mr Brown is poised to unleash on key public services - including his \"opportunity for all\" welfare reforms - the Tories know their best hope is to persuade voters that their taxes are being wasted. In a pamphlet to be published by the Thatcherite Centre for Policy Studies, which he used to run, the Tory MP for Havant rubbishes successsive claims by ministers that the results from the scheme, launched for lone parents as early as July 1997, have been \"very good\". Detailed examination of the DSS's own analysis in March suggests that lone parents claiming income support fell by 120,000 - as the economy boomed - in the two years before 1997, then stopped falling, then resumed at a lower level.

This would work well in the dedicated surgery centres where staff would perform the same operation every day and gain expertise. A new grade of sub-consultants could be trained to do simpler operations. </p> <p>Sir George Alberti supports the \"more imaginative use of non-medical health care specialists\" - who need two or three years of training, compared with the six years for a doctor - for preparing patients before treatment, leaving doctors free to see more patients. </p> <p>The RCN also favours greater responsibilities for senior nurses, including protocols for discharging patients with minor injuries and fast-track referral to consultants. </p> <p>However, Professor Peter Hutton, president-elect of the Royal College of Anaesthetists, said his members \"do not embrace the concept of the nurse-anaesthetist\". He said: \"In Europe, where they have them, they are trying to get rid of them because the morbidity rate is higher.\" </p> <p> <strong> Specialist teams</strong> </p> <p> Specialist \"Swat\" medical teams could be \"airlifted\" into areas with waiting list problems. They could advise on reviewing systems and capacity in those areas. </p> <p> <strong> New consultants' contracts</strong> </p> <p> A renegotiating of hospital consultants' contracts would enable health trusts to demand more hours from consultants, many of whom give time to private practice. </p> <p>This might require a big pay increase for NHS work, but it is unlikely that many would leave the NHS, as falling waiting lists would reduce demand for private care. </p> <p> <strong> Managing demand</strong> </p> <p> Some urge the development of a properly structured and graded system for GPs to refer patients to specialists and to hospitals. It is estimated that 40% of patients referred to consultants do not need to see a specialist. </p> <p>An agreement between GPs of a threshold of referral, with scoring systems for various complaints, would be crucial in ensuring consistency and equity between different GPs' practices and would drastically cut waiting lists for an initial appointment with a consultant. </p> <p>An end to long waiting lists would cause fewer patients to be put on lists in the first place. Mr Edwards said: \"If you have long waiting lists, it's quite common that people are put on them not because they need the treatment now, but because they might need it later.\" </p> <p>The shorter the average wait for treatment, the less complicated and sophisticated the scoring system would need to be. </p> <p>Mike Pringle, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said proper guidelines to prevent inappropriate referral could also mean more referrals from some GPs who had been under-referring their patients. </p> <p>There is great scope for expanding the way in which GPs refer within primary care, Professor Pringle said, pointing to a GP in Burnley with specialist knowledge of dermatology who sees all the patients within his local primary care group with dermatological complaints and then refers on only those who will benefit from seeing a consultant. </p> <p> <strong> Internal efficiency measures</strong> </p> <p> Although many hospital managers operate on the basis of \"the motorway rule\" of supply-induced demand - \"a bed built is a bed filled\" - there are plenty of simple measures to improve efficiency within hospital trusts. </p> <p>The Royal College of Nursing recently called for bed managers on 24-hour call with the authority to manage all bed allocation across hospital trusts. </p> <p>Many doctors favour cutting out some of the long referral stages between a patient going to a GP and getting an appointment with a surgeon, by offering one-stop shops where patients can see all the specialists in a single visit. </p> <p>\"A significant number of patients that consultants see could be managed by nurses or therapists or specialist GPs,\" Mr Edwards said. </p> <p>Limiting appointments with consultants to patients when there is diagnostic uncertainty or uncertainty about the treatment regime could cut waiting times, as could the expansion of accident and emergency teams to include physiotherapists and other specialists. </p> <p> <strong> Better management of chronic conditions</strong> </p> <p> Most emergency admissions are of people with a chronic disease and many of these admissions could be prevented with more systematic management of such problems as heart conditions, asthma and diabetes. </p> <p>In January, nearly all elective beds were used by emergency patients, many of whom had flu. There are a lot of patients for whom a hospital bed is as appropriate a treatment as sending them home would be, so the lack of access to elective beds for \"emergency\" cases would force doctors to look at alternative methods of assessment or treatment. </p> <p> <strong> Educating the public</strong> </p> <p> A national campaign is needed to help patients understand what can and cannot be achieved by hospital care and by consultants, according to Prof Pringle. Good medical practice requires that GPs refer any patient who requests a further consultation, but patients must understand when it is and is not appropriate to seek a second opinion, and how to use the alternative services available to them, such as NHS Direct and pharmacists. </p> <p><strong>Links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/waitingtimes/booklist.htm\">NHS waiting times</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.nhsconfed.net/\">NHS Confederation</a></p>",

An end to long waiting lists would cause fewer patients to be put on lists in the first place. Mr Edwards said: \"If you have long waiting lists, it's quite common that people are put on them not because they need the treatment now, but because they might need it later.\" The shorter the average wait for treatment, the less complicated and sophisticated the scoring system would need to be. Mike Pringle, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said proper guidelines to prevent inappropriate referral could also mean more referrals from some GPs who had been under-referring their patients. There is great scope for expanding the way in which GPs refer within primary care, Professor Pringle said, pointing to a GP in Burnley with specialist knowledge of dermatology who sees all the patients within his local primary care group with dermatological complaints and then refers on only those who will benefit from seeing a consultant. Internal efficiency measures Although many hospital managers operate on the basis of \"the motorway rule\" of supply-induced demand - \"a bed built is a bed filled\" - there are plenty of simple measures to improve efficiency within hospital trusts. The Royal College of Nursing recently called for bed managers on 24-hour call with the authority to manage all bed allocation across hospital trusts. Many doctors favour cutting out some of the long referral stages between a patient going to a GP and getting an appointment with a surgeon, by offering one-stop shops where patients can see all the specialists in a single visit. \"A significant number of patients that consultants see could be managed by nurses or therapists or specialist GPs,\" Mr Edwards said. Limiting appointments with consultants to patients when there is diagnostic uncertainty or uncertainty about the treatment regime could cut waiting times, as could the expansion of accident and emergency teams to include physiotherapists and other specialists. Better management of chronic conditions Most emergency admissions are of people with a chronic disease and many of these admissions could be prevented with more systematic management of such problems as heart conditions, asthma and diabetes. In January, nearly all elective beds were used by emergency patients, many of whom had flu. There are a lot of patients for whom a hospital bed is as appropriate a treatment as sending them home would be, so the lack of access to elective beds for \"emergency\" cases would force doctors to look at alternative methods of assessment or treatment. Educating the public A national campaign is needed to help patients understand what can and cannot be achieved by hospital care and by consultants, according to Prof Pringle. Good medical practice requires that GPs refer any patient who requests a further consultation, but patients must understand when it is and is not appropriate to seek a second opinion, and how to use the alternative services available to them, such as NHS Direct and pharmacists.

He was never one to chase corporate fashion or cave in to the City's calls for quick fixes when occasionally, during his half-century, things got a bit rocky. </p> <p>Instead the chairman sat in a frugal office in a drab Knightsbridge block (Bowater House) and made long-term decisions which produced a company that, all things going smoothly, will reclaim its position in the FTSE 100 next week. </p> <p>With the Weston family still owning more than 60% of the business, there was no real surprise yesterday that the dynasty is to continue in the shape of Garry's 36-year-old son, George, who is becoming deputy chairman as well as continuing his current job running AB Foods' bakeries division. At the same time, Harry Bailey, Garry's right-hand man for the past 20 years or so, becomes non-executive chairman. </p> <p>Yet sadly these appointments looks something of a fudge and very un-Westonesque. Peter Jackson, the chief executive brought in to run the group early last year, will be in the odd position of Weston junior's boss during regular business days and tugging his forelock to the deputy chairman whenever a board meeting is in progress. </p> <p>If Weston junior has been brought up properly and knows the business, Weston senior should do the decent thing and let his son get on with the job. </p> <p><strong> \u00a35m glitch </strong><br> </p> <p> On Tuesday Rentokil, the rat catcher combine, completed its takeover of Ratin, its Danish associate whose only assets were shares in Rentokil. The move clarifies the firm's ownership structure but for technical reasons this has involved the issue of 919m new Rentokil shares which will be cancelled when the lawyers on the deal have finished fiddling about. </p> <p>So some dimwit at FTSE, the joint venture between the stock exchange and the Financial Times which oversees the main market indices, decided on the same day that Rentokil should be reweighted within the various Footsie indicators to take account of all these new shares which, albeit temporarily, increased the company's market capitalisation by almost 40%. </p> <p>By lunchtime yesterday, someone had drawn the Ratin takeover documentation to FTSE's attention and explained the synthetic nature of the transaction. The penny dropped and a fresh statement was rushed out - reducing Rentokil's market capitalisation by 919m shares and cancelling the reweighting. </p> <p>This could be treated as a piece of harmless stock market farce except for the fact a number of gormless fund managers took the original reweighting statement at face value and rushed to buy shares in Rentokil, only to have to turn around yesterday and sell them again. The shares jumped 12.5p on Tuesday in response and then slumped 10p to 150p yesterday. </p> <p>The alleged professional investors getting it all so wrong were so-called passive funds, the index trackers which simply buy shares in proportion to a company's weighting within a particular market index and then sit on these so that their investment performance mirrors the performance of the relevant index. </p> <p>They bought Rentokil automatically because it said on a computer screen that it had become a bigger company. </p> <p>When it all turned out to be a clerical error, the same index-tracking rules forced these institutions to sell - crystallising a loss of up to 7% overnight. The level of dealings yesterday suggested a good \u00a35m has been lost by fund managers who were clearly just following what their computers said they should do rather than bothering to use the brains they were born with. </p> <p><strong> Hitting a wall </strong><br> </p> <p> The investment banks which pulled the plug on the latest attempt to set up a league table of the City's biggest mergers and acquisitions whizz-kids claim they do not want to encourage a \"star culture\" within their firms. </p> <p>However, the real reason why Thomson Financial Securities failed to get any cooperation from the banks probably has less to do with touchy-feely management styles and rather more to do with the embarrassment such a list would cause. </p> <p>The potential for conflict of interest within modern, global investment banks is very real - as is the chance that comprehensive listings of individuals working on particular transactions will highlight these conflicts. </p> <p>For all the promises of Chinese walls, restricting the flow of information round an investment bank, a shrinking number of big advisers means that star corporate financiers build up insider knowledge. As one finance director put it: \"I respect the use of Chinese walls. But you cannot erect one between the left and the right side of the brain.\"</p>",

With the Weston family still owning more than 60% of the business, there was no real surprise yesterday that the dynasty is to continue in the shape of Garry's 36-year-old son, George, who is becoming deputy chairman as well as continuing his current job running AB Foods' bakeries division. At the same time, Harry Bailey, Garry's right-hand man for the past 20 years or so, becomes non-executive chairman. Yet sadly these appointments looks something of a fudge and very un-Westonesque. Peter Jackson, the chief executive brought in to run the group early last year, will be in the odd position of Weston junior's boss during regular business days and tugging his forelock to the deputy chairman whenever a board meeting is in progress. If Weston junior has been brought up properly and knows the business, Weston senior should do the decent thing and let his son get on with the job. \u00a35m glitch On Tuesday Rentokil, the rat catcher combine, completed its takeover of Ratin, its Danish associate whose only assets were shares in Rentokil. The move clarifies the firm's ownership structure but for technical reasons this has involved the issue of 919m new Rentokil shares which will be cancelled when the lawyers on the deal have finished fiddling about. So some dimwit at FTSE, the joint venture between the stock exchange and the Financial Times which oversees the main market indices, decided on the same day that Rentokil should be reweighted within the various Footsie indicators to take account of all these new shares which, albeit temporarily, increased the company's market capitalisation by almost 40%. By lunchtime yesterday, someone had drawn the Ratin takeover documentation to FTSE's attention and explained the synthetic nature of the transaction. The penny dropped and a fresh statement was rushed out - reducing Rentokil's market capitalisation by 919m shares and cancelling the reweighting. This could be treated as a piece of harmless stock market farce except for the fact a number of gormless fund managers took the original reweighting statement at face value and rushed to buy shares in Rentokil, only to have to turn around yesterday and sell them again. The shares jumped 12.5p on Tuesday in response and then slumped 10p to 150p yesterday. The alleged professional investors getting it all so wrong were so-called passive funds, the index trackers which simply buy shares in proportion to a company's weighting within a particular market index and then sit on these so that their investment performance mirrors the performance of the relevant index. They bought Rentokil automatically because it said on a computer screen that it had become a bigger company. When it all turned out to be a clerical error, the same index-tracking rules forced these institutions to sell - crystallising a loss of up to 7% overnight. The level of dealings yesterday suggested a good \u00a35m has been lost by fund managers who were clearly just following what their computers said they should do rather than bothering to use the brains they were born with. Hitting a wall The investment banks which pulled the plug on the latest attempt to set up a league table of the City's biggest mergers and acquisitions whizz-kids claim they do not want to encourage a \"star culture\" within their firms. However, the real reason why Thomson Financial Securities failed to get any cooperation from the banks probably has less to do with touchy-feely management styles and rather more to do with the embarrassment such a list would cause. The potential for conflict of interest within modern, global investment banks is very real - as is the chance that comprehensive listings of individuals working on particular transactions will highlight these conflicts. For all the promises of Chinese walls, restricting the flow of information round an investment bank, a shrinking number of big advisers means that star corporate financiers build up insider knowledge. As one finance director put it: \"I respect the use of Chinese walls. But you cannot erect one between the left and the right side of the brain.\"",

They stressed that they stood ready to negotiate reform in the context of a \"consultant delivered\" service. </p> <p>Peter Hawker, who chairs the BMA's consultants' committee, said: \"I doubt very much that change will pose us too many problems.\" </p> <p>As disclosed yesterday in the Guardian, flexible working by doctors and nurses lies at the heart of the ambitious strategy being discussed in government to cut waiting time for all hospital treatments to less than three months. </p> <p>The prime minister is enthusiastic about the strategy, said by government health advisers to be achievable within the five years of a second Labour term, but the Treasury is anxious at cost implications over and above the 35% increase in NHS funding already promised for the next four years. </p> <p>Alan Milburn, the health secretary, yesterday acknowledged that the strategy was on the table in discussions about the NHS national plan, due to be unveiled by Mr Blair next month. </p> <p>The government could afford to be \"very radical indeed\" in the plan, Mr Milburn said on BBC radio. \"It's simply not on in this day and age, the 21st century, that the best we can guarantee for patients is that they will have to wait no longer than 18 months for treatment.\" </p> <p>Yesterday was designated NHS \"census day\" and the Department of Health completed distribution of 12m leaflets to hospitals, doctors' surgeries, pharmacies and supermarkets asking people to list their top three priorities for modernising health care. </p> <p>Responses, required to be posted within five days, will be collated by two market research companies. But ministers already know that waiting times will be the number one concern. </p> <p>Mr Milburn later acknowledged concerns that people had not been given time to get their responses in before the official deadline and agreed that the wording was unclear. </p> <p>\"I am sorry that there has been confusion about the wording on the consultation leaflet,\" he said. \"But this is a genuine consultation. I value the views of patients about the NHS and I want to hear from them.\" </p> <p>All replies would be seriously considered and a summary would be published as part of the reform plan, Mr Milburn added. </p> <p>Under the waiting list abolition strategy, outlined by the NHS Confederation representing health authorities and trusts but also, critically, backed by key advisers, non-urgent or elective surgery could be carried out in special centres working seven days a week. </p> <p>Dr Hawker warned that such centres would cut off elective surgery and limit essential access to x-ray staff, physicians, and specialists in elderly care. He said: \"We need to have elective capacity, but we have structures for that already - they are called hospitals.\" </p> <p>Even enthusiasts for the concept of surgery centres, specialising in a fixed type or types of operation, cautioned that there were limits to the approach. </p> <p>Roy Lilley, a former NHS trust chairman and now a leading author and pundit on health management, said: \"You could even do things like cataracts and hernias in mobile surgery units - after all, they do cataracts standing in the street in Africa - but for hips you have obviously got to have proper recovery beds and something like a hospital environment.\" </p> <p>Today's consultants' conference will debate flexibility proposals mooted in a health department consultation paper on workforce planning, published in April, which suggested creation of a specialist grade to work \"alongside but not under\" consultants. </p> <p>This comes against a back ground of drawn-out and so far inconclusive talks, initiated in 1997 by the BMA itself, on reforming the consultant contract. The contract is seen by many critics as standing in the way of any real progress on modernising hospital care. </p> <p>A resolution put forward by West Midlands consultants says the proposed grade would \"spread demoralisation among the profession\" and \"avoid the consultant expansion necessary to deliver a service of consistently high quality\". </p> <p>The resolution will meet little opposition. But Dr Hawker will use the opportunity to say that consultants already lead change in the hospital sector - and are prepared to be radical. </p> <p>\"Day case surgery, angioplasty, one-stop clinics, new drugs, new treatments, new techniques have all been led and introduced by doctors,\" he said last night.</p>",

Peter Hawker, who chairs the BMA's consultants' committee, said: \"I doubt very much that change will pose us too many problems.\" As disclosed yesterday in the Guardian, flexible working by doctors and nurses lies at the heart of the ambitious strategy being discussed in government to cut waiting time for all hospital treatments to less than three months. The prime minister is enthusiastic about the strategy, said by government health advisers to be achievable within the five years of a second Labour term, but the Treasury is anxious at cost implications over and above the 35% increase in NHS funding already promised for the next four years. Alan Milburn, the health secretary, yesterday acknowledged that the strategy was on the table in discussions about the NHS national plan, due to be unveiled by Mr Blair next month. The government could afford to be \"very radical indeed\" in the plan, Mr Milburn said on BBC radio. \"It's simply not on in this day and age, the 21st century, that the best we can guarantee for patients is that they will have to wait no longer than 18 months for treatment.\" Yesterday was designated NHS \"census day\" and the Department of Health completed distribution of 12m leaflets to hospitals, doctors' surgeries, pharmacies and supermarkets asking people to list their top three priorities for modernising health care. Responses, required to be posted within five days, will be collated by two market research companies. But ministers already know that waiting times will be the number one concern. Mr Milburn later acknowledged concerns that people had not been given time to get their responses in before the official deadline and agreed that the wording was unclear. \"I am sorry that there has been confusion about the wording on the consultation leaflet,\" he said. \"But this is a genuine consultation. I value the views of patients about the NHS and I want to hear from them.\" All replies would be seriously considered and a summary would be published as part of the reform plan, Mr Milburn added. Under the waiting list abolition strategy, outlined by the NHS Confederation representing health authorities and trusts but also, critically, backed by key advisers, non-urgent or elective surgery could be carried out in special centres working seven days a week. Dr Hawker warned that such centres would cut off elective surgery and limit essential access to x-ray staff, physicians, and specialists in elderly care. He said: \"We need to have elective capacity, but we have structures for that already - they are called hospitals.\" Even enthusiasts for the concept of surgery centres, specialising in a fixed type or types of operation, cautioned that there were limits to the approach. Roy Lilley, a former NHS trust chairman and now a leading author and pundit on health management, said: \"You could even do things like cataracts and hernias in mobile surgery units - after all, they do cataracts standing in the street in Africa - but for hips you have obviously got to have proper recovery beds and something like a hospital environment.\" Today's consultants' conference will debate flexibility proposals mooted in a health department consultation paper on workforce planning, published in April, which suggested creation of a specialist grade to work \"alongside but not under\" consultants. This comes against a back ground of drawn-out and so far inconclusive talks, initiated in 1997 by the BMA itself, on reforming the consultant contract. The contract is seen by many critics as standing in the way of any real progress on modernising hospital care. A resolution put forward by West Midlands consultants says the proposed grade would \"spread demoralisation among the profession\" and \"avoid the consultant expansion necessary to deliver a service of consistently high quality\". The resolution will meet little opposition. But Dr Hawker will use the opportunity to say that consultants already lead change in the hospital sector - and are prepared to be radical. \"Day case surgery, angioplasty, one-stop clinics, new drugs, new treatments, new techniques have all been led and introduced by doctors,\" he said last night.",

      "body": "<p>Kathryn Williams's bedroom wall boasts a picture she has painted of a dog and a crow. It is rather memorable because the dog is shown emptying the contents of his bladder over the crow's head. Standing by the mischievous masterwork, the artist looks every bit as delighted as the mutt with his leg cocked in triumph. </p> <p>\"It's called Summer Golden Showers,\" Williams explains. Dogs are her big obsession. Her last, acclaimed, album was called Dog Leap Stairs and contained a song called Dog Without Wings. The new (and infinitely superior) follow-up, Little Black Numbers, has photographs of a dog all over the cover. She has painted hundreds of them and even spends part of our interview thumbing through a 1969 copy of the Observer Book of Dogs. None of this should have anything at all to do with the music. Except it does. \"Dogs,\" says Williams, pointedly, \"take the black out of the day.\" </p> <p>This blackness is why we are here: the great swathes of melancholy that cut through Williams's brilliantly evocative music. This mood, helped along by the songs' trademark haunting cello sound (provided by her pal Laura Reid), has led to Williams being tagged \"the new Beth Orton\" or, increasingly, \"the new Nick Drake\". Being so labelled understandably sends Williams, well, absolutely barking mad. </p> <p>\"I love Nick Drake but I certainly don't try to sound like him,\" she insists. \"He was a brilliant guitarist, complex and meticulous. I'm really ramshackle and crumbly.\" In fairness, there is something of Nick Drake (you could throw in early Suzanne Vega) in the raindrop way Williams sings - but a truer, more existential comparison lies in the sense of tragedy under the skin of the songs. What is most affecting about Williams's music is the way that melodically uplifting songs are somehow stalked by the Black: it is never actually spelled out but hovers, eerily, like a darkness on the edge of town. </p> <p>\"As you get older the days are shorter and that worries you,\" says the next great queen of bedsit angst, \"and then you spend time worrying about the days being shorter. You realise that there never is a day of pure happiness, or pure sorrow.\" </p> <p>These thoughts - like the lines from her song Flicker about a man's life being \"just a flicker, then a breeze\" could have come from an old woman of the hills, looking back on her life, rather than a disarmingly (and unexpectedly) bubbly young woman. </p> <p>Williams is 26 and was born in Liverpool. Her folk-musician father played the same clubs as the fledgling Beatles and Paul Simon. Her mother listened to Janis Joplin. Although she is reluctant to discuss details, Williams's life has not been without tragedy. It transpires that she was bullied at school (\"I worked at trying to be funny\"); more recently a close friend, Mike Tunner (to whom Little Black Numbers is dedicated), died after being accidentally electrocuted while working in the US. The haunting Fell Down Fast concerns him. </p> <p>\"We were mortal enemies from childhood who would wind each other up,\" she sighs. \"At parties, everyone else would leave the room and we would argue, as a game, for hours. It was this weird thing of having someone who secretly you really loved.\" Since taking up the guitar at art school in Newcastle, where she still lives, Williams's rise has not been easy. Behind her cheery if thoughtful persona lies a sobering tale of debt (self-financing those records: the first cost \u00a380 and the new one \u00a33,000), struggle and sleeping on fans' floors. But she has been rewarded with several breaks. An appearance at the 1999 Barbican Nick Drake tribute catapulted her to national attention; and demo time with London Records led to a sympathetic producer, PJ Harvey's engi neer Head. More recently there was the rare honour of being asked to sing on the new John Martyn album, Glasgow Walker. \"He arrived looking like he had just been dragged through a field, with his flies undone, and he hugged me like a bear - I really like him!\" she says. </p> <p>There probably are not that many excitable 26-year-old John Martyn fans nowadays, nor are the pop charts (the fairly successful Orton aside) exactly brimming with the heritage of Nick Drake, Carole King and Joni Mitchell. But Williams could change that. She points out that in Aberdeen recently her audience ranged in age from 15 to over 60, insisting that while current marketing targets pop at one generation or another, there can be a common ground across the generations. </p> <p>\"I'm playing with new bands and supporting veteran folk people too,\" she says. \"I quite like the way that's not 'cool'. No one is making decent music for audiences of every age group. You've either got 15-year-old boys who buy Garbage because they fancy singer Shirley Manson, or Daniel O'Donnell for the grannies.\" </p> <p>She pauses, slightly reconsidering. \"Well, I suppose there are the Corrs who seem to cross over, but that's_ insidious and sick.\" </p> <p>Her own appeal is universal, she says, because \"everybody needs that quiet time. Everybody needs to cry.\" And they do, apparently rather frequently. \"I feel a complete failure if I haven't made at least one person blubber,\" she says, grinning again but entirely serious. </p> <p>With record company vampires loitering (\"They have even phoned me up at 10.30 at night. I give 'em what for\") and plaudits falling at her feet, Williams seems poised for the commercial breakthrough that should accompany her artistic bound between Dog Leap Stairs and Little Black Numbers, but Williams remains wary. </p> <p>\"Ideally I want a situation where I'm not constricted by money but I don't want money thrown at me,\" she says. Then she reveals that she is far more concerned by a more pressing trauma. \"I haven't owned a dog since my last one died two years ago and I really, really need to convince my flatmates to let me have another one.\" </p> <p>This, it seems, is a real problem, especially given the mountain of debt, an unpaid electricity bill and the noble pooch's infamous capacity for hunger. \"It's not just that, either,\" she says, exasperated. \"Increasingly, I'm living in a household full of cats.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Little Black Numbers is released on June 12.</p>",

However, associates say that he has continued to suffer poor health. </p> <p>AB Foods, originally known as Allied Bakeries, was founded by Garry Weston's Canadian-born father in 1935, and is credited with introducing sliced bread to Britain. </p> <p>Trading at the group has suffered over recent months as customers, such as the big supermarket chains, have exerted fresh downward pressure on AB Foods' margins. Headline interim profits last month showing an 8% drop to \u00a3175m were also affected by last year's decision to distribute a slice of the group's cash mountain to shareholders - including the Weston family. </p> <p>It also warned that over-capacity in milling and baking was squeezing profitability. </p> <p>The group, which employs 34,000 and turns over \u00a34.3bn, has stamped on any suggestion that a wholesale restructuring might be in the offing, denying rumours that its Primark discount clothing chain might be demerged or that the whole group might be taken private.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Eight months after suffering a stroke and 51 years after joining the board of the family company, Garry Weston is stepping down as chairman of Associated British Foods - the food group whose products include Twinings Tea, Wagon Wheels, Kingsmill bread and Silver Spoon sugar. But the Weston family, which owns just over 60% of AB Foods, is keeping a strong grip on the business, with Garry Weston's 36-year-old son George, who runs the bakeries division, moving on to the board as deputy chairman. Garry Weston's long-term business partner, Harry Bailey, is becoming non-executive chairman, with chief executive Peter Jackson and finance director John Bason - the management team put in place last year - continuing to run the group on a day to day basis. At the same time Mr Weston is handing over chairmanship of Fortnum &amp; Mason, the Piccadilly store which is also controlled by the Weston family, to his daughter Jana Khayat. It was announced in September that Mr Weston, 73, had suffered a mild stroke, but it was expected at the time that he would return to work within a few weeks. However, associates say that he has continued to suffer poor health. AB Foods, originally known as Allied Bakeries, was founded by Garry Weston's Canadian-born father in 1935, and is credited with introducing sliced bread to Britain. Trading at the group has suffered over recent months as customers, such as the big supermarket chains, have exerted fresh downward pressure on AB Foods' margins. Headline interim profits last month showing an 8% drop to \u00a3175m were also affected by last year's decision to distribute a slice of the group's cash mountain to shareholders - including the Weston family. It also warned that over-capacity in milling and baking was squeezing profitability. The group, which employs 34,000 and turns over \u00a34.3bn, has stamped on any suggestion that a wholesale restructuring might be in the offing, denying rumours that its Primark discount clothing chain might be demerged or that the whole group might be taken private.",

      "bodyText": "Al Gore turned to his wife, Tipper, to bolster his ailing US presidential campaign yesterday as an opinion poll showed the vice-president trailing Republican rival George W Bush by 10 points. Nobody in the Gore camp is prepared to talk of a campaign relaunch, but the appearance yesterday of the upbeat and voter-friendly Mrs Gore to head up the unveiling of her husband's \"new family agenda\" on mental health came close to being just that. Like Laura Bush, her rival in the race to become first lady, Mrs Gore had played a relatively low-key role in the presidential contest. But yesterday she stepped out of the shadows, in effect upstaging her husband with a hard-hitting campaign speech on her favourite political issue, mental health reform. She committed her husband to a detailed programme of action on mental health issues, including forcing US insurance companies to offer mental health coverage in the medical policies on which most families rely. \"I'm so excited about today. I've looked forward to it - probably all my life,\" Mrs Gore told an audience in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Mrs Gore regularly joins her husband on the campaign trail but her influence, and that of the couple's eldest daughter Karenna, who is also a key political confidante, has until now been exercised out of the public spotlight. Yesterday's rally underlines a recognition by campaign strategists for Mr Gore that traditionally unglamorous issues such as mental health and higher education finance can be turned to his advantage because they loom so large in the everyday concerns of American families. One in four American families has direct experience of mental health care needs, and 51m people in the US receive treatment for a mental disorder in any given year, Mrs Gore said yesterday. She was treated for clinical depression 10 years ago after her then six-year-old son was severely injured in a road accident. After a brief period in March when he drew level with Mr Bush in the polls, Mr Gore has slipped behind once again, trailing the Texas governor in 22 out of the 23 published na tional surveys in April and May. In the latest, taken at the end of last week for Fox News, Mr Bush led Mr Gore by 49% to 39%. The Democrats' decision to showcase Mrs Gore is part of a major rethink in which Mr Gore intends to use the coming weeks before the Independence Day holiday to run a more positive, more autobiographical and more policy-oriented campaign. Since he beat Bill Bradley to the Democratic nomination in March, Mr Gore has spent most of his energy attacking Mr Bush rather than promot ing himself and his own agenda, a strategy that seems to have failed. Over the last month, the US pundits have increasingly warned - or crowed - that Mr Gore is losing the 2000 campaign, reporting ever more explicitly the anxieties of Democratic party elders and candidates in November's Congressional elections. Gore aides privately admit that they have allowed Mr Bush to present himself as the optimistic candidate, and that Mr Gore badly needs to recapture that quality in his own campaign. The first sign of the new-look Gore came a week ago when the vice-president made a speech promoting access to after-school care. Yesterday's mental health policy launch continued the new theme, and Mr Gore intends to keep the warm and compassionate mood going with a speech on fatherhood tomorrow. He will follow these with further speeches on parenthood and family life. And later this month he will make what is being billed as a keynote speech cementing his more positive agenda as the run-up to the August Democratic convention begins.",

      "bodyText": "Russia has relaxed its curbs on exporting sensitive nuclear equipment in a unilateral break with the international consensus that arms control experts say is a blow to non-proliferation efforts. Breaking with the international practice of banning exports of nuclear materials to countries whose nuclear power programmes are not subject to the full scrutiny of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), President Vladimir Putin has decreed that it is up to Russia to decide who may buy its nuclear power products. \"This is a step against the mainstream of the non-proliferation treaty,\" said an international official dealing with nuclear energy. \"Putin's decree makes exports possible without guarantees of fullscope safeguards.\" Mr Putin's decision, the latest evidence of his resolve to pursue a more robust foreign and economic policy regardless of western reservations, ditches commitments by his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, pulling Russia into line with the west in its nuclear exports policy. In theory, Mr Putin's decree will leave Russia free to supply maverick states such as India, Pakistan, North Korea, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Cuba and Yugoslavia with nuclear materials, whereas Mr Yeltsin made this impossible in 1992. Under a Yeltsin decree eight years ago, Russia signed up for the directives of the nuclear suppliers' group which proscribe nuclear exports to countries which either had declined to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty or refused full IAEA access to their civilian nuclear projects. India, Pakistan, Israel, and Cuba have not signed the treaty while North Korea, a signatory, is generally considered to be in breach of the agreement. Analysts saw the go-it-alone move as a mockery of the recent pledge from the big nuclear powers, including Russia, to work towards the full elimination of nuclear weapons and of the talk of progress at the recent non-proliferation review conference in New York. \"This is a softening of Rus sia's non-proliferation policy,\" said Annette Schaper, an international arms control expert at the Peace Research Foundation in Frankfurt, Germany. \"It's a big problem that Russia has unilaterally decided to break with the prevailing consensus.\" Igor Farofontov, of Greenpeace in Moscow, said: \"This is a completely stupid move. We could end up with economic sanctions against us.\" The decision, however, which is in line with Mr Putin's determination to assert Russia's clout on the international stage, reflects the influence on him of the powerful nuclear energy lobby, and also shows his eagerness to cash in on what little of Russia's economic assets remains. In March, Mr Putin made a highly publicised visit to the formerly top secret nuclear research city of Snezhinsk and pledged to reinvigorate the nuclear industry. He has also just abolished the main state agency responsible for environmental protection, a habitual critic of the nuclear lobby. The Putin decree, the international official said, was \"political, a re-interpretation of Russia's commitments under the non-proliferation treaty.\" The Yeltsin decree of 1992 stated that Russia could only export nuclear equipment and materials to countries \"which do not possess nuclear weapons and whose entire nuclear activities are under the guarantees of the IAEA.\" The Putin decree revises this. The Russian government \"in exceptional circumstances\" can decide to export nuclear materials to a country which has no nuclear weapons but which has not placed all its nuclear activity under IAEA safeguards. The client government has to give assurances that the equipment will not be diverted for nuclear weapons purposes. \"This is a revolutionary change in Russia's position on non-proliferation,\" commented the Moscow newspaper, Novye Izvestiya. Nikolai Ryzhov, the deputy minister for atomic energy, said the nuclear exports would proceed if they \"do not contradict Russia's international agreements and if the governments of the countries concerned promise that they will not be used to build nuclear weapons.\"",

      "bodyText": "The government is planning to force councils to shift cash from town hall bureaucracy to classroom education by changing the law to ringfence funds destined for frontline teaching. Though no decision has yet been taken, David Blunkett will reveal today that he is to consult local authorities about the shift as part of the government's drive to \"provide higher standards and greater opportunities for all our children.\" The most efficient local education authorities spend barely 10% of their budgets on administration, while the others spend up to 25% - money that cannot be used on books, equipment and classroom salaries. Ministers are determined to change that. In his speech to the National Association of Head Teachers in Jersey, Mr Blunkett will say: \"There can be no let-up in our drive for higher standards and greater opportunities for all our children. As part of this we need greater clarity about the role of local government in education funding and must ensure that as much money as possible gets to the frontline where it belongs.\" Downing Street last night signalled Tony Blair's support for the education secretary's plan to use the forthcoming green paper on local authority finance to test levels of support for protecting school budgets. Councils are certain to resist it, but heads and some teacher unions may favour the switch - unless the money is swallowed up by consultancy fees. That happened when control of further education was taken away from local authorities under John Major. The Conservatives have already indicated that they will get rid of LEAs and deal directly with schools, as they did with grant maintained schools before Labour brought them back under LEA control. Labour would leave special education - for children with disabilities - school transport and buildings under LEA control. But Mr Blair's impatience with progress in improving standards of key public services is evident in the move. Mr Blunkett's announcement will be welcomed by head teachers, who are increasingly vocal in their criticism of local education authorities. Delegates at the NAHT conference in Jersey yesterday supported a motion calling for at least 80% of LEA money for schools to be passed on directly to head teachers, although they drew back from a demand for 100%. David Hart, the NAHT general secretary, said that heads broadly supported Mr Blunkett's view that if LEAs did not exist something like them would have to be invented. But he expected after the next election that LEAs would be reduced to supplying a few functions, such as transport and support for children with special educational needs, and not much else. Mr Blunkett will today act on complaints from the NAHT by simplifying the procedure for heads bidding for cash from the Standards Fund, a \u00a31.7bn kitty for delivering government-backed initiatives such as the literacy and numeracy strategies. Grants will be delivered under six broad headings, rather than the current 44, and few will require competing bids between schools. He will also promise a new war on red tape, by cutting the number of documents sent to heads by his department by a third and the number of pages by half. By 2002, paper-based communication between the Department for Education and Employment and the head teachers will have ended, with schools linked to the DfEE via the internet. However, schools would still be able to get printed versions if they wanted them.",

No films, no wireless, no television, no voice-overs. Above all, no microphones. When she finished - she made her last stage appearance aged 87 - all branches of the medium were thriving. Mainly she stuck to the stage, although it was a stint in television as Reg Varney's mum in On the Buses which brought her unexpected fame.</p> <p>After her stage debut in her birthplace, Bargoed in Monmouthshire, as a tiny tot in her mother's roaming repertory company, Hare never looked back. \"I'll do anything, dear, as long as they pay me,\" she said.</p> <p>She seemed as happy in Shakespeare, Marlowe, Shaw, Pinero and Max Frisch as in Pinter, Shaffer, Alan Bennett or No Sex, Please, We're British. And one of her best performances in the theatre was as the permissive, toothless Granny Tooke, aged 120, in Sandy Wilson's 1957 version of Ronald Firbank's novel Valmouth, about a bunch of outrageous Edwardians at a seaside spa. She was there, too, in the same part in Chichester Theatre's revival in 1981.</p> <p>While the Americans once compared her comic talent on Broadway to Beatrice Lillie's, the Merchant Navy took her to its heart in the second world war after a wartime series of BBC broadcasts called Shipmates Ashore. The programme, with Hare as compere, was held to have done much to raise morale. For that she won an MBE.</p> <p>On Broadway she had acted opposite Emlyn Williams in the premiere of his thriller Night Must Fall (1936), and in London was hailed by James Agate as the \"best comedian\" in a Charles Cochran revue, Lights Up! (1940), for Evelyn Laye.</p> <p>As a young girl, she toured in revues at home and abroad. She worked the halls with Max Miller - and had just played the Holborn Empire when it was bombed in 1940. In the West End she sang and danced for No\u00ebl Coward and Andr\u00e9 Charlot, or pranced about as Toinette in Moli\u00e8re's Le Malade Imaginaire, or did pantomime in the suburbs or played duchesses by the sea. And when the new post-war intellectual drama was heralded, Hare was there in The Fire Raisers at the Royal Court in 1961, going on to join the Royal Shakespeare Company as one of its long-term contract artists in Peter Hall's heyday, and thence to the National Theatre under Olivier, and Chichester under John Clements.</p> <p>The pre-war years of song-and-dance and having to establish character instantaneously equipped her for the more serious-minded stuff of the 1960s - as Shakespeare's Mistress Quickly in The Merry Wives of Windsor, Mrs Peachum in The Beggar's Opera, Katherine in Marlowe's The Jew of Malta or Mary Hearn in The Farmer's Wife.</p> <p>When, in wartime, she and Evelyn Laye performed, for example, a somewhat scaled-down Cochran revue in a hangar at Scapa Flow for the Merchant Navy, clinging to the rafters with ships' officers holding down the actresses billowing skirts, stage technique in such untheatrical circumstances was crucial.</p> <p>What she also learned from having been in so many kinds of show, especially revue, was to project her personality with immediate impact and sympathy. Characters who might in other hands have been rated obscure or wearisome - the sluttish half-wit Meg for example in Pinter's The Birthday Party in 1964 - became in Hare's distinctive and funny.</p> <p>Of the literal obscurity at the premiere of Shaffer's Black Comedy in 1965, in which the cast had to move around brightly lit but supposedly in total darkness, Hare recalled how \"awful\" rehearsals were until, on the director's order, they were all blindfolded. As Miss Furnival, gingerly feeling her prissy, genteel way about the Chichester stage, Hare would think she knew where she was - \"until you suddenly found yourself in the street...\"</p> <p>Like other highly experienced actresses, she was prone to shameful fits of the giggles. In Heartbreak House as Nurse Guinness, she played opposite John Clements, \"a great giggler on the stage like myself. I thought as soon as we are both on stage I'll collapse. He began it, and I just had to dig my fingernails in my hands and struggle.\"</p> <p>Hare soldiered on in tours of light comedies (Fiddlers Three, Birds of Paradise) and took over for a year as Eleanor Hunter in No Sex, Please, We're British in 1974, before returning to Shakespeare as the Nurse in a tour of Romeo and Juliet and a West End run as Mrs Ashworth in Waters of the Moon in 1978.</p> <p>In her seventies she still loved to tour, something her generation was ever fond of - even overseas. She went merrily round, first South America and then Israel as Mrs Swabb in Alan Bennett's Habeas Corpus; and so back to Sussex and the still eyebrow-raising Valmouth.</p> <p>Although she loved to relate how she was half-way up a mountain in Montenegro when challenged by a native as to whether she was Reg Varney's mother, and how other foreigners pursued her for autographs with \"Momma! Momma!\", it was the theatre that mattered most.</p> <p>Doris Hare was married, in 1941, to John Fraser-Roberts, a surgeon. They divorced in 1973. She is survived by her two daughters.</p> <p><b>Doris Hare, actress, born March 1 1905; died May 29 2000</b></p>",

The programme, with Hare as compere, was held to have done much to raise morale. For that she won an MBE. On Broadway she had acted opposite Emlyn Williams in the premiere of his thriller Night Must Fall (1936), and in London was hailed by James Agate as the \"best comedian\" in a Charles Cochran revue, Lights Up! (1940), for Evelyn Laye. As a young girl, she toured in revues at home and abroad. She worked the halls with Max Miller - and had just played the Holborn Empire when it was bombed in 1940. In the West End she sang and danced for No\u00ebl Coward and Andr\u00e9 Charlot, or pranced about as Toinette in Moli\u00e8re's Le Malade Imaginaire, or did pantomime in the suburbs or played duchesses by the sea. And when the new post-war intellectual drama was heralded, Hare was there in The Fire Raisers at the Royal Court in 1961, going on to join the Royal Shakespeare Company as one of its long-term contract artists in Peter Hall's heyday, and thence to the National Theatre under Olivier, and Chichester under John Clements. The pre-war years of song-and-dance and having to establish character instantaneously equipped her for the more serious-minded stuff of the 1960s - as Shakespeare's Mistress Quickly in The Merry Wives of Windsor, Mrs Peachum in The Beggar's Opera, Katherine in Marlowe's The Jew of Malta or Mary Hearn in The Farmer's Wife. When, in wartime, she and Evelyn Laye performed, for example, a somewhat scaled-down Cochran revue in a hangar at Scapa Flow for the Merchant Navy, clinging to the rafters with ships' officers holding down the actresses billowing skirts, stage technique in such untheatrical circumstances was crucial. What she also learned from having been in so many kinds of show, especially revue, was to project her personality with immediate impact and sympathy. Characters who might in other hands have been rated obscure or wearisome - the sluttish half-wit Meg for example in Pinter's The Birthday Party in 1964 - became in Hare's distinctive and funny. Of the literal obscurity at the premiere of Shaffer's Black Comedy in 1965, in which the cast had to move around brightly lit but supposedly in total darkness, Hare recalled how \"awful\" rehearsals were until, on the director's order, they were all blindfolded. As Miss Furnival, gingerly feeling her prissy, genteel way about the Chichester stage, Hare would think she knew where she was - \"until you suddenly found yourself in the street...\" Like other highly experienced actresses, she was prone to shameful fits of the giggles. In Heartbreak House as Nurse Guinness, she played opposite John Clements, \"a great giggler on the stage like myself. I thought as soon as we are both on stage I'll collapse. He began it, and I just had to dig my fingernails in my hands and struggle.\" Hare soldiered on in tours of light comedies (Fiddlers Three, Birds of Paradise) and took over for a year as Eleanor Hunter in No Sex, Please, We're British in 1974, before returning to Shakespeare as the Nurse in a tour of Romeo and Juliet and a West End run as Mrs Ashworth in Waters of the Moon in 1978. In her seventies she still loved to tour, something her generation was ever fond of - even overseas. She went merrily round, first South America and then Israel as Mrs Swabb in Alan Bennett's Habeas Corpus; and so back to Sussex and the still eyebrow-raising Valmouth. Although she loved to relate how she was half-way up a mountain in Montenegro when challenged by a native as to whether she was Reg Varney's mother, and how other foreigners pursued her for autographs with \"Momma! Momma!\", it was the theatre that mattered most. Doris Hare was married, in 1941, to John Fraser-Roberts, a surgeon. They divorced in 1973. She is survived by her two daughters. Doris Hare, actress, born March 1 1905; died May 29 2000",

      "body": "<p>The salt-water crocodile seized Karla round the hips and she heard her pelvis snap. As she said, \"It took the wind out of me at the time.\" You can quite see it might. Her father jumped on the croc and wrestled her out of its jaws. He did not appear in The Secret Life of Crocodiles (BBC 1) and - with a family in that line of business - you hesitate to ask why. </p> <p>Though Karla survived the attack, she nearly died from the subsequent water-borne infection. Crocodiles themselves are immune to such infection, which led Dr Adam Britton to theorise that they might produce a natural, powerful antibiotic. All you need is a cooperative crocodile. </p> <p>I myself have been suffering from a form of down-under deficiency since Les, also known as Bush Tucker Man, disappeared from Discovery's schedules. Bush Tucker Man used to live off the land and, indeed, anything that ran fractionally slower than he did. Rolf Harris is an unsatisfactory stopgap in this respect. How often have you seen him tuck into an iguana? Exactly. </p> <p>To get a sample of blood from a wild salt-water crocodile, Dr Britton secured the services of Bluey Pugh, his mate, Dog, and his 11-year-old daughter, Frog. Frog, who could hardly see over the dashboard, drove the van (\"She's a rough rider, that kid\"). Bluey offered to take the doc up Timber Creek in a tin boat borrowed from a bloke down the pub. The idea was to harpoon a salt-water crocodile, pull it to the side of the boat and stick a hypodermic in it. Now crocodiles feel, like Tony Hancock, that a test tube is nearly a tailful, and a crocodile is not one to hide his feelings.

      "bodyText": "The salt-water crocodile seized Karla round the hips and she heard her pelvis snap. As she said, \"It took the wind out of me at the time.\" You can quite see it might. Her father jumped on the croc and wrestled her out of its jaws. He did not appear in The Secret Life of Crocodiles (BBC 1) and - with a family in that line of business - you hesitate to ask why. Though Karla survived the attack, she nearly died from the subsequent water-borne infection. Crocodiles themselves are immune to such infection, which led Dr Adam Britton to theorise that they might produce a natural, powerful antibiotic. All you need is a cooperative crocodile. I myself have been suffering from a form of down-under deficiency since Les, also known as Bush Tucker Man, disappeared from Discovery's schedules. Bush Tucker Man used to live off the land and, indeed, anything that ran fractionally slower than he did. Rolf Harris is an unsatisfactory stopgap in this respect. How often have you seen him tuck into an iguana? Exactly. To get a sample of blood from a wild salt-water crocodile, Dr Britton secured the services of Bluey Pugh, his mate, Dog, and his 11-year-old daughter, Frog. Frog, who could hardly see over the dashboard, drove the van (\"She's a rough rider, that kid\"). Bluey offered to take the doc up Timber Creek in a tin boat borrowed from a bloke down the pub. The idea was to harpoon a salt-water crocodile, pull it to the side of the boat and stick a hypodermic in it. Now crocodiles feel, like Tony Hancock, that a test tube is nearly a tailful, and a crocodile is not one to hide his feelings. This one opened up the tin boat like a can of baked beans. \"There's a big hole in the side of the boat!\" called Jill Fullerton Smith, the producer, whom I strongly suspect of enjoying herself throughout. \"Yeah, we can see it,\" said Bluey laconically as Timber Creek rose round their ankles. Time after time, a blood sample was flown to America for analysis at the BBC's expense and, for one reason or another, proved unsuitable.

Legal action will begin in September in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium and similar cases are expected to be launched in Spain, Italy, France and Germany. The footballers and clubs claim that their names and identities have been used in popular computer games such as Fifa 2000, Uefa Euro 2000 and This is Football without their consent. They are furious that they were not consulted and are seeking compensation worth at least \u00a31.6m in Belgium alone. Five software firms are being sued; London-based Sony Computer Entertainment Europe; Electronic Arts; Liverpool-based Rage Games; Info grammes; and Eidos, the maker of the cult game Tomb Raider. The matter has been taken up by Jean-Louis Dupont, the lawyer who won the landmark Bosman case which changed the face of European football and brought about changes in the law covering football transfers and foreign players. Clubs such as Rangers, of Glasgow, Feyenoord FC, Slavia Prague, Vicenza and several German and Swiss clubs are involved and more are expected to sign up. A core of international players, many of them Romanian, such as Gheorghe Hagi, are also pressing for damages. \"The aim of the case is to stop people profiting from other people's names without having asked their permission first.

The main allegation is that British software makers are using players' identities, including their skin and hair colour, team position and the way they play without authorisation. It is also alleged that they have illegally appropriated football teams' colours and strips. The case is not being brought until September to avoid clashing with Euro 2000. \"We didn't want to bring a knife to their throat so close to the competition,\" Mr Dessard says. The Belgian law firm handling the case is confident that the software firms will cave in to its demands. \"If they are bright they will try to find a solution to this or else they are going to have a lot of trouble on the continent.\" It also believes that publicity about the case will open the floodgates for other European football clubs and players to press for damages. Sony, which owns the This is Football franchise, said yesterday \"it would vigorously defend [its] legitimacy\" but declined to enter into specifics of the case. \"We have got advance notice of a writ that will be served but we have not received it yet,\" a spokeswoman said. Industry insiders said Sony did however have a so-called Fifpro licence which was supposed to cover players' interests. Surrey-based Electronic Arts, which designed Uefa Euro 2000 and Fifa 2000, said it was aware of the case but refused to comment.",

      "body": "<p>Interviewed this week on American DJ Howard Stern's radio show, Rachel Hunter offered some advice to her ex-husband Rod Stewart. Stay off the blondes, Hunter counselled the singer, who was said to be devastated when she walked out of their Beverly Hills mansion 16 months ago. Since then, Stewart has been seen with, among others, model-cum-TV presenter Caprice, Hugh Hefner's ex-wife Kimberly and Essex photography student Penny Lancaster. But if he is to get over the failure of their marriage, Hunter advises, he should follow in her own abstemious footsteps. \"I think it is really important to be single for a while before you get back into it. I love relationships but you need time. I have been celibate for seven months. I am waiting for the right man, a man who clicks with me.\"</p> <p>It's a familiar story. Couple splits up, he denies his feelings and dives into a string of meaningless relationships, she seeks to work through the pain, all the while holding on to the possibility that true love will re-enter her life. It's tempting, then, as the tabloid press did yesterday, to cast Hunter as a tragic heroine and Stewart as an eternal lad, unable to change his wayward habits, as though they are playing out a real-life chapter from Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.</p> <p>Yet who's to say that Stewart is dealing with their break-up any worse than Hunter? It is sometimes easy to forget an essential fact about relationships. They don't make sense. They're fragmented, chaotic, exhilarating and perplexing. Just as what happens between two people never follows a set of rules, neither is there a guide by which to measure the collapse of a relationship. Long schooled in blokeish badinage, men tend to talk about separation as though it were a challenge to their masculinity. Like hunters, we advise each other to \"get back in the saddle\". Like fishermen, we say: \"There are plenty more fish in the sea.\"</p> <p>But although it's seductive to suggest that, like cavemen, we are singularly lacking in emotional depth, that's to miss what is really being said when we console each other. Or rather what's not being said, because men feel, all too keenly, the loss and pain that comes with separation. It's just that it is expressed in the sighs and spaces and sudden lapses in conversation that punctuate all the empty words of the newly single. As a coping strategy, it has its flaws. Like troops back from the Somme, recently separated men have the sunken eyes and gaunt cheeks of those wrestling with a private horror. But it does mean that men refuse to make the break-up of a relationship central to their lives. Even while they hurt, they continue to work and meet their friends and talk about sport. Even if all that's holding them up is pride. And that approach has its advantages.</p> <p>\"Women privilege relationships above everything else,\" complains Adele, who has been single for two years and provided a shoulder to cry on for many of her girlfriends when their relationships have ended. For her, the supportive group of females huddling close to offer hugs and support in times of sorrow, as celebrated in fiction, films and TV shows like Friends, is a pernicious development. \"It's quite boring really if the main focus of your peer group is relationships. It means there are so many other aspects of life that are being overlooked and so many other relationships, apart from those with boyfriends, that you could share but don't. Its permissible to talk about partners, for instance, but not dads. There's a huge cost to it all in how we come to look at ourselves and respect ourselves.\"</p> <p>Following Adele's theory, it's possible to argue that Rachel Hunter, celibate for seven months and \"waiting for the right man\", is living as much of a fantasy as Rod Stewart. While he is pursuing pleasure as a way to salve pain, she is putting part of her life on hold in favour of an idealised notion of love that belongs in Mills &amp; Boon.</p> <p>Unlike Stewart and Hunter, though, most couples don't deal with the end of their affair in such absolute terms. In many modern relationships, there is no clear-cut end at all. Instead, couples make up and break up time and time again. They sleep together and drift apart, and maintain an erratic orbit around each other for months, even years, before finally breaking up or possibly becoming friends. And they do so out of choice, not compulsion because, despite the determinism of books like Men Are From Mars, they know that relationships don't follow a gender-defined script. And it is precisely their unpredictability, their promise of magic or chaos, that draws couples together, however much it hurts when they split apart.</p>",

It means there are so many other aspects of life that are being overlooked and so many other relationships, apart from those with boyfriends, that you could share but don't. Its permissible to talk about partners, for instance, but not dads. There's a huge cost to it all in how we come to look at ourselves and respect ourselves.\" Following Adele's theory, it's possible to argue that Rachel Hunter, celibate for seven months and \"waiting for the right man\", is living as much of a fantasy as Rod Stewart. While he is pursuing pleasure as a way to salve pain, she is putting part of her life on hold in favour of an idealised notion of love that belongs in Mills &amp; Boon. Unlike Stewart and Hunter, though, most couples don't deal with the end of their affair in such absolute terms. In many modern relationships, there is no clear-cut end at all. Instead, couples make up and break up time and time again. They sleep together and drift apart, and maintain an erratic orbit around each other for months, even years, before finally breaking up or possibly becoming friends. And they do so out of choice, not compulsion because, despite the determinism of books like Men Are From Mars, they know that relationships don't follow a gender-defined script. And it is precisely their unpredictability, their promise of magic or chaos, that draws couples together, however much it hurts when they split apart.",

      "bodyText": "The French media, already bound by some of the world's strictest privacy rules, reacted angrily yesterday to a new law that places even tougher restrictions on the pictures newpapers and television stations may use. The legislation, part of an overhaul of the criminal justice system aimed at preserving the presumption of innocence and protecting victims' rights, was passed unanimously by the French senate despite claims that it amounts to censorship. The new rules outlaw pictures of untried defendants wearing handcuffs and - more controversially - ban the media from showing the victims of crimes or violence if the image is likely to \"jeopardise the dignity of the person portrayed\". They were partly a response to public outcry at the alleged behaviour of paparazzi in the wake of the car crash that killed Diana, Princess of Wales, and at the graphic pictures in the French press of the victims of a 1990s Paris bombing campaign by Algerian terrorists. But the authoritative daily Le Monde said that newspapers would now \"hesitate to publish pictures of France as it is\". The editor of Paris Match, one of the picture-led publications most likely to suffer under the new regime, described the rules as retrograde, unworkable and unjust. \"We are being asked to divert our lenses while CNN and every other European newspaper will show the full reality,\" Alain Genestar told a conference on press freedom yesterday. \"We will not be content with showing a shattered window to illustrate a terrorist bombing.\" Mr Genestar, who also devoted his editorial in this week's issue of the magazine to the legislation, said Paris Match would be willing to \"break the law in the name of freedom of information.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the steam room, a tanned 22-year-old is relating the story of a pick-up she had recently. \"She suddenly pulled out these needles and handed them to me!\" \"What sort of needles?\" echoes a voice from the other end of the room. \"You know, for piercing. She wanted me to put them through her nipples!\" General gasps and murmurings roll from the mists, followed by a chorus of \"Go on\" and \"What happened next?\"</p> <p>What happened next was that she \"put the needle through one and it was like, whoosh, amazing, then I put the needle through the other and it was like, whoosh!\" And then, unfortunately, the steam gets overbearing. Dehydration levels go through the roof, the warm lager and red wine in plastic beakers strewn around the floor prove inadequate thirst slakers and one has to exit rapidly, tantalised as to whether the \"whoosh\" referred to the spurting blood or ensuing orgasm.</p> <p>The good thing about the ongoing lesbian revolution is that everything new that happens can be deemed culturally and politically significant. The fact is that lesbian liberation has reached the point at which women in London can now live like sleazy gayboys on Mondays here at Flirt and dirty old men on Tuesdays at Loose, a female-only pole dancing night. For the rest of the week, they can act like 70s bimbos by rehearsing for the two lesbian beauty contests taking place in the next few weeks. (Not just one lesbian beauty contest, but two!)</p> <p>Naturally, the concept of mindless hedonism for lesbians - a kind of gayboy scene for gaygirls - is still in its salad days and female reactions are bound to be different from male ones. Everyone has a gay male friend who will moan, in a bored voice, about how awful gayboy saunas are (the groping hands , sordid goings-on) - so awful, they have to keep going back. But if there is an element of Sodom and Gomorrah to the lesbian sauna, it is more Sodom and Gomorrah meets the netball team. There is some lechery here tonight but mostly there is that all girls together messing around at the back of the class sort of spirit.</p> <p>Still, how life has changed for lesbians since the 70s when the backdrop to lesbian politics was flickering candles, bobbly jumpers, Joan Baez soundtracks and sex in the back seat. Such codes of practice were inevitable as lesbian feminism was just starting up and you have to make the rules before you can break them - but the rules seemed to stay in place for an inordinately long time. Even three years ago, lesbians with longish hair or lipstick or skirts would be stopped on the door of gay clubs like London's Heaven and asked by bouncers to \"prove\" that they were lesbian by, say, naming three lesbian clubs (except there weren't three lesbian clubs).</p> <p>No such starter-for-10 questions at Loose in Soho on Tuesday nights, hosted by Chrystal, a Polish/Swedish bisexual dancer who struts around the stage in Gucci spikes and diamant\u00e9. She has a cute thing going with her index finger and lips, a sexy little kiss she gives audience members who are adventurous with the dollar bills they place in various straps, belts and folds. Dollars are on sale for \u00a31 each, as are tequila shots - and Chrystal admits a female audience tends to have that Tupperware party vibe until well watered. Then, she says, they tip more generously than the men who fill the place the rest of the week.</p> <p>Kai, who runs women-only sex shop Shh!, says this is where she sends her \"curious\" customers, \"the ones who respond to all those lesbiany fashion ads\". For them, she says, it's the perfect place to go. \"You don't have to be the sad person sitting at the bar. You don't have to do anything. You can interact with other women just by putting dollars in their crotch.\"</p> <p>Female audiences are more appreciative than male ones, but tougher. \"You shake your butt a bit for men and you wear some underwear and they're happy as Larry. Women want better dance routines, better costumes. There's none of that mystique thing to pull the wool over their eyes.\"</p> <p>The woman behind this transformation of lesbian nightlife is Kim Lucas, who started out with the Candy Bar three years ago and went on to open Loose and Flirt. But the new scene is not just in London: Lucas will open a Candy Bar in Brighton in July and Manchester has women-only bar Vanilla. Lucas recently joined forces with the management there to organise the Lesbian Holiday - a two-week, all-in package to Lesbos.</p> <p>Yet while there is much to be grateful for, not all in the lesbian garden is rosy. Outside London or Manchester, a lesbian is hard-pressed to find much on the entertainment front. Check one of the messages currently posted on the dyke board of <a href=\"http://www.RainbowNetwork.com\" target=\"_NEW\">RainbowNetwork.com</a>: \"Is there anyone in the Notts area that wants meaningless sex, if so let me know, I'm gagging for it.\"</p> <p>Like male homosexuals in the 30s, many lesbians are still trying to suss out the secret handshake that gives them access to the wonderful lesbian nirvana they've been reading about in Vogue. Steph Kay from Vanilla says the trouble with lesbians is that they tend to stop going out once they have found a partner, whereas many gay men in couples have long abandoned the heterosexual model of life-long fidelity. This is good news for the clubs. Non-monogamous coupledom has its dangers but it also keeps gay men together for longer than many lesbian couples who often remain for a long time in bad relationships simply because they fear not meeting anyone else. The lesbian pool is so much smaller, they reason, and therefore there are less places to go out. The vicious circle, in short.</p> <p>Still, over at Flirt, the alcohol and dehydration seem to be doing the trick on the loosening-up front. The Israeli Daryl Hannah lookalike who hasn't had sex in a year has got off with the Chinese American in the jacuzzi's volleyball game. Then the tanned 22-year-old comes and sits on my lap, saying, like a brazen gayboy: \"Can I kiss you, then?\"</p> <p>I mumble something about having a girlfriend and she says: \"Just a quick one?\" with a fetching little moue. By now, you figure, there would have been an orgiastic pile-up in a gayboy sauna and you start thinking again about cultural and political change, about the dyke dollar and such, and you end up making a snap lesbian decision - a cross between teenage dementia, Catholic guilt trip and run-of-the-mill heterosexual response. \"Well, OK then, but only for a count of ten.\"</p> <p>\"Ten?\"</p> <p>\"Ten.\" And so the pioneering work begins. \"One, two, three, four, five.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the steam room, a tanned 22-year-old is relating the story of a pick-up she had recently. \"She suddenly pulled out these needles and handed them to me!\" \"What sort of needles?\" echoes a voice from the other end of the room. \"You know, for piercing. She wanted me to put them through her nipples!\" General gasps and murmurings roll from the mists, followed by a chorus of \"Go on\" and \"What happened next?\" What happened next was that she \"put the needle through one and it was like, whoosh, amazing, then I put the needle through the other and it was like, whoosh!\" And then, unfortunately, the steam gets overbearing. Dehydration levels go through the roof, the warm lager and red wine in plastic beakers strewn around the floor prove inadequate thirst slakers and one has to exit rapidly, tantalised as to whether the \"whoosh\" referred to the spurting blood or ensuing orgasm. The good thing about the ongoing lesbian revolution is that everything new that happens can be deemed culturally and politically significant. The fact is that lesbian liberation has reached the point at which women in London can now live like sleazy gayboys on Mondays here at Flirt and dirty old men on Tuesdays at Loose, a female-only pole dancing night. For the rest of the week, they can act like 70s bimbos by rehearsing for the two lesbian beauty contests taking place in the next few weeks. (Not just one lesbian beauty contest, but two!) Naturally, the concept of mindless hedonism for lesbians - a kind of gayboy scene for gaygirls - is still in its salad days and female reactions are bound to be different from male ones. Everyone has a gay male friend who will moan, in a bored voice, about how awful gayboy saunas are (the groping hands , sordid goings-on) - so awful, they have to keep going back. But if there is an element of Sodom and Gomorrah to the lesbian sauna, it is more Sodom and Gomorrah meets the netball team. There is some lechery here tonight but mostly there is that all girls together messing around at the back of the class sort of spirit. Still, how life has changed for lesbians since the 70s when the backdrop to lesbian politics was flickering candles, bobbly jumpers, Joan Baez soundtracks and sex in the back seat. Such codes of practice were inevitable as lesbian feminism was just starting up and you have to make the rules before you can break them - but the rules seemed to stay in place for an inordinately long time. Even three years ago, lesbians with longish hair or lipstick or skirts would be stopped on the door of gay clubs like London's Heaven and asked by bouncers to \"prove\" that they were lesbian by, say, naming three lesbian clubs (except there weren't three lesbian clubs). No such starter-for-10 questions at Loose in Soho on Tuesday nights, hosted by Chrystal, a Polish/Swedish bisexual dancer who struts around the stage in Gucci spikes and diamant\u00e9. She has a cute thing going with her index finger and lips, a sexy little kiss she gives audience members who are adventurous with the dollar bills they place in various straps, belts and folds. Dollars are on sale for \u00a31 each, as are tequila shots - and Chrystal admits a female audience tends to have that Tupperware party vibe until well watered. Then, she says, they tip more generously than the men who fill the place the rest of the week. Kai, who runs women-only sex shop Shh!, says this is where she sends her \"curious\" customers, \"the ones who respond to all those lesbiany fashion ads\". For them, she says, it's the perfect place to go. \"You don't have to be the sad person sitting at the bar. You don't have to do anything. You can interact with other women just by putting dollars in their crotch.\" Female audiences are more appreciative than male ones, but tougher. \"You shake your butt a bit for men and you wear some underwear and they're happy as Larry. Women want better dance routines, better costumes. There's none of that mystique thing to pull the wool over their eyes.\" The woman behind this transformation of lesbian nightlife is Kim Lucas, who started out with the Candy Bar three years ago and went on to open Loose and Flirt. But the new scene is not just in London: Lucas will open a Candy Bar in Brighton in July and Manchester has women-only bar Vanilla. Lucas recently joined forces with the management there to organise the Lesbian Holiday - a two-week, all-in package to Lesbos. Yet while there is much to be grateful for, not all in the lesbian garden is rosy. Outside London or Manchester, a lesbian is hard-pressed to find much on the entertainment front. Check one of the messages currently posted on the dyke board of RainbowNetwork.com: \"Is there anyone in the Notts area that wants meaningless sex, if so let me know, I'm gagging for it.\" Like male homosexuals in the 30s, many lesbians are still trying to suss out the secret handshake that gives them access to the wonderful lesbian nirvana they've been reading about in Vogue. Steph Kay from Vanilla says the trouble with lesbians is that they tend to stop going out once they have found a partner, whereas many gay men in couples have long abandoned the heterosexual model of life-long fidelity. This is good news for the clubs. Non-monogamous coupledom has its dangers but it also keeps gay men together for longer than many lesbian couples who often remain for a long time in bad relationships simply because they fear not meeting anyone else. The lesbian pool is so much smaller, they reason, and therefore there are less places to go out. The vicious circle, in short. Still, over at Flirt, the alcohol and dehydration seem to be doing the trick on the loosening-up front. The Israeli Daryl Hannah lookalike who hasn't had sex in a year has got off with the Chinese American in the jacuzzi's volleyball game. Then the tanned 22-year-old comes and sits on my lap, saying, like a brazen gayboy: \"Can I kiss you, then?\" I mumble something about having a girlfriend and she says: \"Just a quick one?\" with a fetching little moue. By now, you figure, there would have been an orgiastic pile-up in a gayboy sauna and you start thinking again about cultural and political change, about the dyke dollar and such, and you end up making a snap lesbian decision - a cross between teenage dementia, Catholic guilt trip and run-of-the-mill heterosexual response. \"Well, OK then, but only for a count of ten.\" \"Ten?\" \"Ten.\" And so the pioneering work begins. \"One, two, three, four, five.\"",

      "bodyText": "Where is it? London W1. Be more precise: It runs south from Regent's Park to Cavendish Square. Famous for: Expensive operations by fashionable doctors. Named after a famous quack? No. Its name comes from Edward Harley, the 2nd Earl of Oxford; he owned the land in the 18th century. How do I get there? Tell your GP you're tired of waiting to have your hernia done on the NHS and that you'll pay to go private. Don't be cynical. Anyway, it's not a hernia, it's lip enlargements I want; my local hospital doesn't do them. If you can afford that sort of cosmetic surgery, you can easily pay for a taxi to take you there. All right. But it's confusing; there's Harley St and Upper Harley St, isn't there? There is, but that could soon change. Why? The Crown Estate wants the upper part of the street, which it owns, to revert to its original name, Brunswick Place. Why did it change in the first place? So many private quacks were piling into Harley St in the 20s, that some had to take consulting rooms in the section north of Marylebone Road. So what? With Upper Harley St rather than Brunswick Place on their bills, they could charge more. Did Harley St always cater for rich patients? Yes, even in the 19th century, the Hospital for Sick Gentlewomen was there. Not the sort of place Florence Nightingale would be seen dead in? On the contrary, the Lady with the Lamp worked there for a year. Other famous (healthy) residents: Wilkie Collins wrote much of The Woman in White at number 12. Famous patients? Take your pick over the decades - from Virginia Woolf to Patsy Kensit and Pinochet. Speaking of golden oldies, wasn't Heseltine in the Harley St clinic with a dickey heart? Yes, but, strangely, the clinic's on Weymouth St. Not to be confused with: Harley-Davidson, Steve Harley, Street of Shame.",

John Peel started the fight 30 years ago when he exposed a rock audience to his weird and wonderful \"archive things\" - ethnographic material from all over the world, played to a late-night audience on his Radio 1 show. The fight was taken up by the World of Music, Arts and Dance (Womad) launched in 1982 in Bath. Mainstream acts, such as the Beat and Echo and the Bunnymen, shared the stage with the drummers of Burundi and performers from 25 countries demonstrated the rich diversity of the world's music. All the talk was of the financial unviability of the project but, nearly 20 years on, Womad festivals continue. Andy Kershaw is part of that courageous tradition, valuing diversity and challenging racism by showcasting the best of what the world has to offer. <br><b> Derek Gadd</b><br> London</p> <p>The music which Andy has become a respected broadcaster for presenting - world music, roots and folk - has been sorely under-represented on our airwaves. In the record megastores, you will find a large amount of floor space given over to these genres. These companies would have those racks out overnight if they were not profitable. In 1999, when the press was full of stories of rock and dance festivals failing, all the big world music and folk festivals - Womad, Sidmouth, Cambridge - were sold out.</p> <p>How ill-timed to remove the only decent radio show covering all this. Andy Kershaw is the kind of broadcaster the BBC should be cultivating; he manages to enthuse and inform, educate and entertain from a strong position of knowledge, experience and good judgement. <br><b> Ian Anderson</b><br> Editor, f-Roots Magazine <a href=\"mailto:froots@froots.demon.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">froots@froots.demon.co.uk</a></p> <p>We have lost a vital forum for innovative music composition.

Derek Gadd London The music which Andy has become a respected broadcaster for presenting - world music, roots and folk - has been sorely under-represented on our airwaves. In the record megastores, you will find a large amount of floor space given over to these genres. These companies would have those racks out overnight if they were not profitable. In 1999, when the press was full of stories of rock and dance festivals failing, all the big world music and folk festivals - Womad, Sidmouth, Cambridge - were sold out. How ill-timed to remove the only decent radio show covering all this. Andy Kershaw is the kind of broadcaster the BBC should be cultivating; he manages to enthuse and inform, educate and entertain from a strong position of knowledge, experience and good judgement. Ian Anderson Editor, f-Roots Magazine froots@froots.demon.co.uk We have lost a vital forum for innovative music composition. Ironically, this music is then adopted into the loops and samples used by the current dance music hybrids so loved by the Radio 1 schedulers. Enin Johnson Ingrave, Essex",

      "body": "<p>The prospect of Melvyn Bragg appearing on Celebrity Stars in their Eyes is an enticing one, and if television regulators get their way, the doyen of ITV's arts programmes may be forced to consider alternative career moves. As the television landscape evolves, the Reithian definition of public service broadcasting - inform, educate, entertain - is being updated. </p> <p>In a consultation paper published yesterday, the independent television commission (ITC) suggests the network should not be forced to provide expensive and often unpopular \"public service\" programmes if it is to compete effectively with the specialist channels invading the traditional channels' public service heartlands. </p> <p>The proposals came only a week after the commission had issued a scathing attack on ITV's arts policy, when it called for a complete rethink. But as the digital television age advances, the ITC says its requirements to show factual, arts, drama and other specialised programmes may become overburdening and should be scaled back, or even abolished. Channel 5's similar - although less onerous - obligations may also have to go. But Channel 4 and the BBC should continue to have a strong public service remit, it says. </p> <p>The ITC's chairman, Sir Robin Biggam, said: \"The broadcasting environment is now changing rapidly so we need to reassess and redefine public service broadcasting in the multi-channel digital world. It is clear that public service broadcasting provided by the free-to-air broadcasters will be a cornerstone of future regulation, so it is important to define its role in the developing multi-channel environment.\" </p> <p>In its paper, the commission said that, in the short term, ITV should not be stripped of its principal public service obligations, because of the pressure it would exert on the BBC. As a deregulated ITV chased higher peak-time ratings and advertising revenue, the BBC would be tempted to do the same. </p> <p>But after the analogue signal is switched off, when most homes in Britain have converted to digital television, the position will have changed significantly, the commission suggests. </p> <p>\"ITV's ability to deliver public service broadcasting in the longer term, well beyond digital switchover, can not be guaranteed. If its market position erodes significantly, ITV's commitment to fund the less popular programmes in the public service broadcasting mix may diminish and some support from other sources may be necessary,\" it says in the consultation paper. </p> <p>Already, channels such as Discovery, the History Channel and National Geographic are providing specialised services; impartial news is provided by several broadcasters on dedicated channels; while the Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon provide children's programmes. Artsworld, a new arts channel, is about to be launched with investment from the Guardian Media Group and others. </p> <p>ITV's obligation to provide distinctive regional programmes will be the subject of a separate consultation paper, to be published next week. </p> <p>The commission stresses that Channel 4 should remain in the public sector: privatisation, favoured by the Treasury, would place severe pressure on the broadcaster's \"ethos, breadth and individuality\". </p> <p>In the medium term, while most viewers continue to tune in to the five main channels, regulation should be simplified but not swept away altogether, the commission stresses. But it adds: \"Looking further ahead, more significant changes are likely to be appropriate, involving the reduction and perhaps ultimately the abolition of public service broadcasting regulation as we see it today.\" </p> <p>The commission is inviting views before it formulates a final position. The government is preparing a communications white paper, to be published this year, to form the basis of wide-ranging legislation. </p> <p><strong>Ruling the air waves, or waiving the air rules?</strong></p> <p><strong> BBC</strong> </p> <p> According to its charter, the BBC must provide a \"properly balanced service consisting of a wide range of subject matter\" and \"serve the tastes and needs of different audiences\". Standards must be high, \"in particular in respect of their content, quality and editorial integrity\". Television and radio services must be provided \"as a public service for disseminating information, education and entertainment\". There are specific requirements relating to cultural programmes, news and current affairs, sport, education, programmes for children and young people, regional programmes and coverage of parliament. </p> <p><strong> ITV</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Diversity</strong> </p> <p>Licensees must provide a service covering nine programme strands: drama, entertainment, sport, news, factual, education, religion, arts and children's programmes. </p> <p><strong> Minimum requirements</strong> </p> <p>Licensees must provide one hour 30 minutes a week of current affairs, 10 hours of children's programmes, two hours of religious output. Quotas for regional programming vary from 2 hours 30 minutes to 14 hours 30 minutes, depending on the region. </p> <p><strong> News</strong> </p> <p>Regional licensees must take national and international news from a nominated news provider (currently ITN) and broadcast it live and simultaneously across the network. They must broadcast bulletins in peak time. </p> <p><strong> Origin and quality of programmes</strong> </p> <p>65% of programmes must be originally produced or commissioned, and a majority of transmissions, except news, sports events, games, advertising and teletext, must be of European origin. At least 25% must be from independent production companies. There is a general requirement for high-quality programmes. </p> <p><strong> Channel 4</strong><br> </p> <p> The 1990 Broadcasting Act requires the channel to be a \"public service for disseminating information, education and entertainment\". Programmes must be of a high standard and wide-ranging, and the channel must be distinctive. Programmes must contain \"a suitable proportion of matter calculated to appeal to tastes and interests not generally catered for by Channel 3\", and must be innovative and experimental. There is a requirement to provide educational programmes and high-quality news and current affairs. </p> <p><strong> S4C</strong><br> </p> <p> The 1990 act provides for S4C as a public service channel in Wales. A \"substantial proportion\" of the output must be in Welsh, and programmes broadcast between 6.30pm and 10pm must consist mainly of programmes in Welsh. These must be wide-ranging and of a high standard. </p> <p><strong> Channel 5</strong><br> </p> <p> Most obligations are similar to those for ITV, but Channel 5 does not have to provide regional programmes or take its news from ITN. There are quotas (lower than those for ITV) for current affairs, religious and children's programmes. It does not have to provide programmes in other categories.</p>",

If its market position erodes significantly, ITV's commitment to fund the less popular programmes in the public service broadcasting mix may diminish and some support from other sources may be necessary,\" it says in the consultation paper. Already, channels such as Discovery, the History Channel and National Geographic are providing specialised services; impartial news is provided by several broadcasters on dedicated channels; while the Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon provide children's programmes. Artsworld, a new arts channel, is about to be launched with investment from the Guardian Media Group and others. ITV's obligation to provide distinctive regional programmes will be the subject of a separate consultation paper, to be published next week. The commission stresses that Channel 4 should remain in the public sector: privatisation, favoured by the Treasury, would place severe pressure on the broadcaster's \"ethos, breadth and individuality\". In the medium term, while most viewers continue to tune in to the five main channels, regulation should be simplified but not swept away altogether, the commission stresses. But it adds: \"Looking further ahead, more significant changes are likely to be appropriate, involving the reduction and perhaps ultimately the abolition of public service broadcasting regulation as we see it today.\" The commission is inviting views before it formulates a final position. The government is preparing a communications white paper, to be published this year, to form the basis of wide-ranging legislation. Ruling the air waves, or waiving the air rules? BBC According to its charter, the BBC must provide a \"properly balanced service consisting of a wide range of subject matter\" and \"serve the tastes and needs of different audiences\". Standards must be high, \"in particular in respect of their content, quality and editorial integrity\". Television and radio services must be provided \"as a public service for disseminating information, education and entertainment\". There are specific requirements relating to cultural programmes, news and current affairs, sport, education, programmes for children and young people, regional programmes and coverage of parliament. ITV Diversity Licensees must provide a service covering nine programme strands: drama, entertainment, sport, news, factual, education, religion, arts and children's programmes. Minimum requirements Licensees must provide one hour 30 minutes a week of current affairs, 10 hours of children's programmes, two hours of religious output. Quotas for regional programming vary from 2 hours 30 minutes to 14 hours 30 minutes, depending on the region. News Regional licensees must take national and international news from a nominated news provider (currently ITN) and broadcast it live and simultaneously across the network. They must broadcast bulletins in peak time. Origin and quality of programmes 65% of programmes must be originally produced or commissioned, and a majority of transmissions, except news, sports events, games, advertising and teletext, must be of European origin. At least 25% must be from independent production companies. There is a general requirement for high-quality programmes. Channel 4 The 1990 Broadcasting Act requires the channel to be a \"public service for disseminating information, education and entertainment\". Programmes must be of a high standard and wide-ranging, and the channel must be distinctive. Programmes must contain \"a suitable proportion of matter calculated to appeal to tastes and interests not generally catered for by Channel 3\", and must be innovative and experimental. There is a requirement to provide educational programmes and high-quality news and current affairs. S4C The 1990 act provides for S4C as a public service channel in Wales. A \"substantial proportion\" of the output must be in Welsh, and programmes broadcast between 6.30pm and 10pm must consist mainly of programmes in Welsh. These must be wide-ranging and of a high standard. Channel 5 Most obligations are similar to those for ITV, but Channel 5 does not have to provide regional programmes or take its news from ITN. There are quotas (lower than those for ITV) for current affairs, religious and children's programmes. It does not have to provide programmes in other categories.",

Speaking during the US-European Union summit in Portugal, Mr Clinton confirmed that he would offer American know-how to Russia in order to defuse its opposition to the controversial missile defence system, nicknamed \"son of star wars\". Mr Clinton goes to Moscow on Saturday for his first face-to-face meeting with President Vladimir Putin, who is concerned about US plans to amend a key cold war arms control treaty to permit the construction of the system. European leaders oppose the multi-billion dollar project on the grounds that it could divide Nato as well as spark a new arms race which would prompt Russia and China to bolster their nuclear arsenals. However, European objections have so far been muted. Mr Clinton is to decide before the November elections whether to deploy the missile shield, intended to protect the US against \"rogue\" states like Iraq and North Korea, after tests due in July. \"I don't think we could advance the notion that we had this technology designed to protect us against a new threat, a threat which was also a threat to other civilised nations who might or might not be nuclear powers and not make it available to them,\" President Clinton said.

The EU's foreign policy supremo, Javier Solana, said he did not expect these issues to weaken other aspects of the US-EU relationship. On Monday Washington threatened to retaliate against EU exports after Brussels rejected US revisions to the so-called foreign sales corporation programme, aimed at bringing the US into line with World Trade Organisation rules. The row centres on a 15% tax break for US exporters that is worth $3.5bn a year and benefits giants including Boeing, General Motors and Microsoft.

      "body": "<p>He was a mod. That much I can say for sure. Four-button Madras jackets, buttoned high; Ben Sherman shirts, Sta-Prest parallel trousers that in Newcastle at that time were known as \"parallels\" or \"strides\". There was a vogue for wearing desert boots that started around 1963 or 1964, and a way of walking that involved spinning an invisible stone away with the outside of the left foot, and then the right. The left foot and then the right. A hunched-shouldered, duck-toed walk that seemed to come naturally to the footballers at the school. Was MacSweeney a footballer? I don't remember. He was an athlete, though; a runner. Long-legged. Clean limbed. Not poet material at all. (Not even a poet of the cool school, supposing we had known what that was.) </p> <p>He had the walk: head down, toes in, haversack slung by a single strap over one shoulder, school tie tied at the skinny end to make a hard, nut-sized knot. He was a face. He had that hair. The boy/girl hair, parted in the middle, fading into bum-fluff at the ears and whisked up into a small bit of baloney at the back - back-combed into a high tuft or boll at the crown. He was sweet-faced. A true androgyne. And very sweet-natured. Cherubic, you would have to say, even allowing for the protuberant jug ears. Sweeno. He was a shy boy, as I remember him; neat and clean, with deep dimples when he smiled and a strawberry flush that constantly threatened to turn into a scalding, full-blown blush. Maybe that's why he started drinking. In his autobiographical Vietnam novel, The Things They Carried, Tim O'Brien claims that it wasn't being caught in crossfire or napalmed or blown apart that the \"grunts\" on the ground were most afraid of; what they were most afraid of was turning red in front of the other men in their company; they were scared of blushing. </p> <p>The blurb for Barry MacSweeney's last collection, The Book of Demons, an account of how the demon drink chased and harried and finally (of course) caught him, says MacSweeney was an alcoholic from the age of 16. Many people doubt it. I doubt it. I knew him when he was 16. Not well (not at all, it now seems). I knew him when he was 17 and 18. But his first wife believes he was an alcoholic when she married him in 1968, when he was still only 20. Three years earlier, in a poem collected in his first book, The Boy From the Green Cabaret Tells of His Mother, he had written about \"looking for these dark bottles/over the pelmet under the stairs/these green bottles in roomcorners/in the loft these peculiar places\". A precocious premonition that his destiny was to be a plonkie. </p> <p>MacSweeney wrote the cover copy for his last book himself: \"Barry MacSweeney wrote his first poem at the age of seven and has been an alcoholic since he was 16 . . . His solitary hard drinking almost killed him, and after a series of life-threatening fits and convulsions, which ended with him on a life-support machine, he underwent rehabilitation through detoxification in several hospitals and an addiction clinic. He has now recovered.\" He wrote this in what was most likely a state of semi-stupor, the state in which he spent most of the last years of his life, still married to the sense of romantic mystery which allied him with the roster of flame-outs and fuck-ups and holy losers he had been fixated on from his youth. </p> <p>\"His notion of the artist was formed around a myth of exemplary failure and belated recognition,\" one of MacSweeney's obituarists, Andrew Crozier, wrote two weeks ago in the Guardian. \"Rimbaud was an early model for this, others included Chatterton, Shelley, Van Gogh, Jim Morrison and Robert Johnson.\" A poet and literary academic, Crozier had known MacSweeney for 35 years. He first met him in a pub after a poetry reading in 1964 and remembers him as a moddy boy - a super-mod - carrying a biography of Van Gogh. \"All that's missing is the parka,\" Crozier told MacSweeney, who was only trying to get a bit of bohemianism into his life. He reacted badly. Maybe that's why he started drinking. </p> <p>He became a little bit beardy. Bushy sideboards and that sort of thing. Kind of wild hair. Big mutton-chop whiskers. But still a long way from what they used to call a beardy-weirdy. There used to be an expression used in the north-east: a face that looked like somebody had chopped sticks on it. Not Barry's face. Not Barry's face then, and - according to those who knew him, and in spite of taking up residence on \"Cirrhosis Street, Wrecked Head Road\", \"living daily rim to mouth\" - not Barry's face when he died. It's a long trip from \"angel boyhood\", as MacSweeney himself acknowledged, \"to scarred bottledom\". Yet, on the evidence of his friends, he remained - outwardly - remarkably unravaged, almost right up to the end. </p> <p>His dapperness, it seems, never left him; his keen fastidiousness and his sense of style. Just before he published The Book of Demons in 1997, he tracked down a whisker on the map called Demon's Beck in Northumberland. He was living alone and in considerable squalor by this time, in a mess of bottles and takeaway cartons, usually nursing whatever injury had been caused by his latest fall. He had nasty falls. Toward the end he broke a lot of bones. Knee, ankle, shoulder, ribs - the final year he was seen by eight different hospitals for drink-related accidents. But one of the last pictures shows him in a long, dark overcoat over a black silk mohair suit, wearing a pair of shined-up black Florsheim shoes by the Beck, which turns out to be a rubble-clogged semi-sewer. \"Lurking inside the shy Barry was another Barry,\" Jackie Litherland, his partner through the final years, says. \"This was Barry the dandy. He had at least two people in his personality. He would retreat for weeks to what he called his \"ravaged corner\". His lair. It was like a den. A drinking den, really. But he was also a great dandy. Shoes immaculate, tie perfect, suit draped. He had a lot of style.\" </p> <p>MacSweeney and I both had interviews with Thomson Newspapers in Newcastle when we were 16. I went back to school to do A-levels; he left to become a cub reporter on the Evening Chronicle. It was a move which, as luck would have it, brought him into everyday contact with a grizzled greybeard who had counted Ford Madox Ford, WB Yeats and Ezra Pound among his friends. By the early 60s, Basil Bunting had been working in obscurity as a subeditor on the Newcastle Chronicle for several years. His responsibilities included the daily tide table and the City column. Bunting was as old as the century, and his serious writing life seemed to be behind him in 1964. In fact, his reputation as England's major modernist poet was about to be revived by an 18-year-old self-confessed \"work conchy\" (conscientious objector) and \"dole walla\" called Tom Pickard, who had just rented a tower on the old city walls from Newcastle Corporation for 10 shillings a week and, with his wife Connie, was about to transform the cultural life of a region. </p> <p>It is impossible to overstate the impact the Mordern Tower had on me as a booksniff sixth-former, and presumably on MacSweeney, who I regularly saw there as an aspiring poet. The beats came and things occasionally got riotous and dope was smoked. Instead of the usual adolescent maunderings and set texts, at Mordern Tower we were exposed to mad riffers and homosexuals and junkies; to Ed Dorn, Robert Creeley and Alex Trochhi; to Ferlinghetti, Gregory Corso, Ginsberg and other speakers of scary stuff we'd never heard before. Stuff that didn't scan or rhyme or do any of the things that our teachers at the grammar school told us it was meant to do. \"Free verse\", its visionary exaggerations jiving with a darkly \"beat\" personal style. It was for: the expression of immediate feeling and \"visible truth\"; the internal logic of sounds rather than imposed sense (letting it all hang out). It was against: careful, complex, ironic and well-finished work; the anecdotal and the small scale. I bought the donkey jacket; I wore the beard. But in MacSweeney's case, it changed his life. The isolation, the rejection, the gut-spilling, the torment and despair. He went the whole way. </p> <p>The next time I saw him was in Hudson's student bookshop in Gosta Green in Birmingham. He was staring out at me from the vaguely psychedelic front cover of The Boy From The Green Cabaret Tells of His Mother, his first book. It was 1968 and he was 19 and a celebrity by virtue of having been put up for Oxford University's chair of poetry by his publisher. It was a scam, of course. A publicity stunt. But it was a less celebrity-fixated culture then, and MacSweeney wasn't wise to the ways of the world, and didn't see the train until it hit him. He got burned. </p> <p>\"He felt ridiculed,\" Jackie Litherland says. \"They trashed him. He was just a kid. He found it very difficult to get published after that. He was seen as a 60s fashion victim. The talent didn't diminish, but his manuscripts were rejected.\" </p> <p>\"As an economic activity, poetry is marginal,\" Andrew Crozier says, \"just as is, for example, hill farming. No one wishes to admit this.\" MacSweeney was a burn-out at 20. Surplus to requirements; edged out, marginalised; exiled from the mainstream. As it happened, this turned out to be not such a lonely place to be. At Mordern Tower it had been MacSweeney's good fortune to make the acquaintance of the Cambridge don and poet JH (Jeremy) Prynne. It was Prynne's belief that, freed from a unitary, closed-system, \"great-tradition\" view of culture, the margin could legitimately be seen as the centre. He was the eminence grise of the so-called Cambridge school of writers, which included Andrew Crozier and Peter Riley and, more indirectly, Peter Ackroyd and Iain Sinclair. Prynne is famous for the bloody intractability of his work; for what has been called its \"almost mythic quality of luminous opacity\". And he became MacSweeney's mentor. </p> <p>Encouraged by Prynne in the early 70s, MacSweeney published a small-press appreciation of Thomas Chatterton that retrospectively, and probably inevitably, seems shot through with prescience. \"Thomas Chatterton, the English romantic poet, was born in Bristol on November 20 1752, and swallowed arsenic 18 years later in London - starved and unrecognised,\" is Elegy For January's opening sentence. Later, apropos of apparently nothing, MacSweeney writes: \"I think of the motorcyclist who does not attempt to avoid the head-on crash, but accelerates into his death.\" </p> <p>For the remaining 30 plus years of his life, MacSweeney disappeared into the alternative universe of the little magazines; of fugitive publications and samizdat editions. He started a small imprint of his own, Blacksuede Boot Press, named for the Cuban-heeled boots Bob Dylan wore in the 60s. As a last resort, he would Roneo his poems and send them out to the hardcore of 20 people. \"As long as they're out there. You always get the work out,\" he'd tell Jackie Litherland when she was having difficulty getting her own work published. More recently, he would hit the fax machine in the middle of the night, when he was on a bender and getting shitfaced and writing. His friend, Rick Caddel, co-director of the Basil Bunting poetry centre at the University of Durham, would arrive to find miles of fax paper being unravelled in the mornings by the secretaries. More of Barry's yes-I-am-drinking rants. </p> <p>But did MacSweeney opt out of poetry's mainstream for ideological reasons, or was he shut out against his will, I wanted to know from Caddel when I went to see him. \"There is a whole level of texts that define themselves by their unavailability,\" he said. \"Editions of two or three-hundred or less. I think a lot of people prefer to be published this way. Certainly for Prynne for a long time it was an important point to control publication. Not to be seen to be in the same commodity market, as it were. Whether or not Barry deliberately chose to be published by the small presses, or whether he believed if he sent his work to Faber it would be rejected, I don't know. It is very dangerous to be part of that commoditised counter-culture, the way Tony Harrison is, say. I do know Barry agonised over sending The Book of Demons to Bloodaxe when the time came.\" </p> <p>Ranter, MacSweeney's 1985 collection, had been turned down by Bloodaxe in Newcastle. He was devastated when The Tempers of Hazard, his selected poems, were pulped in the year of publication, after Rupert Murdoch acquired Paladin in 1993. He became reclusive and embittered. He disappeared into the bottle and lost his job as deputy editor of the Shields Gazette, where he had worked for eight years. It was around this time that his and Jackie Litherland's paths crossed again. They had originally met at National Union of Journalist conferences many years earlier when they were both attached to the NUJ. The person she encountered was not the Barry MacSweeney she remembered, but a shrinking, violently eczema'd figure, hiding under a baseball cap. </p> <p>But he courted her, she says, \"with a high style\". When he was sober, they took trips to the country; he cooked, brewed exotic teas. When he was drinking, he disappeared to his lair in Newcastle and stayed there until he wanted to go sober again. It broke down into a pattern of roughly two months in each place. A dry period followed by the wet season. \"I am the addict,\" as he wrote in one of his late poems, \"strapping on his monumental thirst.\" </p> <p>\"The craving would return,\" Litherland says. \"He'd become very violent. He had problems with anger. You can see it in the poems, which range from the most innocent things in his nature, right across to the most dark. But almost malicious. He'd reach a crescendo of craving. And then he'd just . . . do it.\" </p> <p>MacSweeney had been in and out of hospitals and detox clinics for more than a year when, visiting him at his semi in Newcastle in June 1995, Litherland was witness to a catastrophic event. MacSweeney suffered a fit or convulsion in the course of which his head swelled terrifyingly and he vomited black foam and gouts of black blood. He had five more fits in quick succession in the hospital and was put on a life-support machine. </p> <p>\u00a310,000 from the Royal Literary Fund bought him a \"cure\" at a top drying-out clinic, and he went back to writing up his experiences in the series of bleak and terrifying - and occasionally jocular - poems that were to make up his last (but not his final) book. The Book of Demons is a work that MacSweeney apparently relished reading in public. It is a full-on rant through the language and, according to one witness, he was \"completely transformed\" when he performed these accounts of bodily trauma and pathetic abjection and breaking his head. </p> <p>\"I know it's a very middle-class way to describe it,\" Rick Caddel said, voicing some of my own reservations, \"but I do wonder whether The Book of Demons celebrates the demons, or are they, as he claimed they were, being thrust away? I've got a very love/hate relationship with that book.\" </p> <p>\"The Book of Demons does celebrate drink,\" Jackie Litherland admits. \"But it's written by an alcoholic. As an alcoholic, what you're fighting is your love of it; the fact that you adore it. That's the addiction. Alcoholics glory in the allure of drink. The demons only come when you want to give up. Because they want you to drink again. That's part of the attraction of the book for me.\" </p> <p>Instead of being equal parts sober and blotto, the drinking binges started to extend until they entirely consumed MacSweeney's life. He started hallucinating wildly. He broke an ankle; a shoulder. He was forever topping-up and awash with drink. Burbling down the phone to his friends hour upon hour and falling over. He was never not drunk. </p> <p>In 1995 he had published a set of poems which described his childhood relationship with a mute Northumbrian girl he taught to read and write. The poems in Pearl will stand alongside the best of their time and, together with the later Demons poems, represent the work by which MacSweeney is likely to be judged. But in the last year, friends say he had started to feel he had written himself out. He was drowning in drink and beginning to repeat himself. </p> <p>Jackie Litherlan met him for dinner at Pani's, an Italian restaurant in the centre of Newcastle, on Friday May 5, just under four weeks ago. He brought her a rare Dylan bootleg - Dylan in Sydney, 1966 - which he told her he'd paid \u00a3100 for (he hadn't). He had been drinking, and he continued to drink. He collapsed when he stood up to go. But they knew him at Pani's, and they gave him half an hour to get himself together. After half and hour, he collapsed again. Jackie managed to get him into a taxi, which took him home. </p> <p>The last person to talk to MacSweeney was Terry Kelly, a reporter on the South Shields Gazette who MacSweeney had worked alongside for years. He spoke to Kelly on the morning of Monday May 9 and then made a trip into Newcastle to buy a new Bob Dylan record that Kelly had mentioned on the phone. MacSweeney foresaw the manner of his own death: \"One day choke on it, tongue/ jammed backwards down/ throat's clogged highway\". </p> <p>He failed to phone his mother to let her know he was still alive on the Tuesday morning. She discovered his body among the empties in the one room he used in his house. \"Clink Eastwood\", as he sometimes used to jokingly refer to himself. </p> <p>\u0095 Memorial readings for Barry MacSweeney will be held in Newcastle on Friday June 16 at the Hatton Gallery, Newcastle University 2pm and 8pm at the Mordern Tower</p>",

The person she encountered was not the Barry MacSweeney she remembered, but a shrinking, violently eczema'd figure, hiding under a baseball cap. But he courted her, she says, \"with a high style\". When he was sober, they took trips to the country; he cooked, brewed exotic teas. When he was drinking, he disappeared to his lair in Newcastle and stayed there until he wanted to go sober again. It broke down into a pattern of roughly two months in each place. A dry period followed by the wet season. \"I am the addict,\" as he wrote in one of his late poems, \"strapping on his monumental thirst.\" \"The craving would return,\" Litherland says. \"He'd become very violent. He had problems with anger. You can see it in the poems, which range from the most innocent things in his nature, right across to the most dark. But almost malicious. He'd reach a crescendo of craving. And then he'd just . . . do it.\" MacSweeney had been in and out of hospitals and detox clinics for more than a year when, visiting him at his semi in Newcastle in June 1995, Litherland was witness to a catastrophic event. MacSweeney suffered a fit or convulsion in the course of which his head swelled terrifyingly and he vomited black foam and gouts of black blood. He had five more fits in quick succession in the hospital and was put on a life-support machine. \u00a310,000 from the Royal Literary Fund bought him a \"cure\" at a top drying-out clinic, and he went back to writing up his experiences in the series of bleak and terrifying - and occasionally jocular - poems that were to make up his last (but not his final) book. The Book of Demons is a work that MacSweeney apparently relished reading in public. It is a full-on rant through the language and, according to one witness, he was \"completely transformed\" when he performed these accounts of bodily trauma and pathetic abjection and breaking his head. \"I know it's a very middle-class way to describe it,\" Rick Caddel said, voicing some of my own reservations, \"but I do wonder whether The Book of Demons celebrates the demons, or are they, as he claimed they were, being thrust away? I've got a very love/hate relationship with that book.\" \"The Book of Demons does celebrate drink,\" Jackie Litherland admits. \"But it's written by an alcoholic. As an alcoholic, what you're fighting is your love of it; the fact that you adore it. That's the addiction. Alcoholics glory in the allure of drink. The demons only come when you want to give up. Because they want you to drink again. That's part of the attraction of the book for me.\" Instead of being equal parts sober and blotto, the drinking binges started to extend until they entirely consumed MacSweeney's life. He started hallucinating wildly. He broke an ankle; a shoulder. He was forever topping-up and awash with drink. Burbling down the phone to his friends hour upon hour and falling over. He was never not drunk. In 1995 he had published a set of poems which described his childhood relationship with a mute Northumbrian girl he taught to read and write. The poems in Pearl will stand alongside the best of their time and, together with the later Demons poems, represent the work by which MacSweeney is likely to be judged. But in the last year, friends say he had started to feel he had written himself out. He was drowning in drink and beginning to repeat himself. Jackie Litherlan met him for dinner at Pani's, an Italian restaurant in the centre of Newcastle, on Friday May 5, just under four weeks ago. He brought her a rare Dylan bootleg - Dylan in Sydney, 1966 - which he told her he'd paid \u00a3100 for (he hadn't). He had been drinking, and he continued to drink. He collapsed when he stood up to go. But they knew him at Pani's, and they gave him half an hour to get himself together. After half and hour, he collapsed again. Jackie managed to get him into a taxi, which took him home. The last person to talk to MacSweeney was Terry Kelly, a reporter on the South Shields Gazette who MacSweeney had worked alongside for years. He spoke to Kelly on the morning of Monday May 9 and then made a trip into Newcastle to buy a new Bob Dylan record that Kelly had mentioned on the phone. MacSweeney foresaw the manner of his own death: \"One day choke on it, tongue/ jammed backwards down/ throat's clogged highway\". He failed to phone his mother to let her know he was still alive on the Tuesday morning. She discovered his body among the empties in the one room he used in his house. \"Clink Eastwood\", as he sometimes used to jokingly refer to himself. \u0095 Memorial readings for Barry MacSweeney will be held in Newcastle on Friday June 16 at the Hatton Gallery, Newcastle University 2pm and 8pm at the Mordern Tower",

He has also decided to step down as leader of the 17-strong group in the assembly where Plaid Cymru forms the main opposition to the minority Labour administration. He will remain in the post until the new party president has been elected in July.

      "bodyText": "An American veteran of the Korean war, whose claim to have taken part in a massacre of civilians was central to a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation, was exposed yesterday as a fantasist. Edward Daily, who said he was a member of the historic 7th Cavalry, was actually a clerk and mechanic in another unit and nowhere near the scene when soldiers opened fire at No Gun Ri nearly 50 years ago. \"I have to agree with your records,\" said the 69-year-old when he was shown military papers indicating that he was miles away with the 27th Ordnance Maintenance Unit at the time. \"I can't dispute them. I still feel as though I was at No Gun Ri. I did not intend to be deceptive.\" Mr Daily's \"eye-witness\" account was one of the main sources for a Pulitzer Prize-winning Associated Press news agency report which was the first to show that Americans had taken part in the killings. Recent reports have cast doubt on his credibility. But the executive director of AP, Jonathan Wolman, said: \"While we remain confident of the central findings of our coverage, AP is dismayed that Ed Daily cannot authenticate his account of the events at No Gun Ri.\" Many other witnesses, including South Koreans, have confirmed that the massacre happened on July 26 1950, with estimates of the dead running from fewer than 50 to more than 300. Mr Daily denies fabricating records but yesterday's New York Times reported that sources close to the United States army's investigation of the killings had obtained fake documents that undermined his claims - among them, that he had been awarded the Silver Cross for bravery. The former steel worker had joined an association for winners of the Distinguished Service Cross which he never received and had shown friends a regimental group photograph in which his head appeared to have been superimposed on that of another man. \"I have the feeling now that Daily was a conman although I don't know why he was,\" William Hoffmann, a former 7th Cavalry platoon leader said. \"How else could a nice guy who has been so strong in promoting the 7th Cavalry and organising reunions and coming to them and giving speeches do this? I'm still puzzled.\" Some Korean war veterans say that they believed Mr Daily was at No Gun Ri because he had insinuated his way into their defective memories in telephone calls, at reunions and in bar room talk. Richard Burns, a consultant for the book Stolen Valour: How the Vietnam Generation Was Robbed of Its Heroes and Its History, said more former soldiers were falsely claiming responsible for dishonourable behaviour. \"They do that because there is a movement in this country, the victim-hero thing. 'People will feel sorry for me that I killed children and women and they will understand me',\" he said. Jonas Rappeport, a retired forensic psychiatrist, said: \"It is not uncommon when a serious murder occurs for a couple of folks to drop by and say 'I did it'.

      "body": "<p>Here's a test. Tall skinny guy - we'll call him Tom Green - goes to a vet. He produces a carry case, opens it, pulls out a small, mangled hunk of roadkill which may once, long ago, have been a cat. Asks the vet if he can help. </p> <p>So, are you laughing? </p> <p>OK, how about this? Tall skinny guy goes out on crutches, falls over. Anyone tries to help, he screams in agony as the street grinds to a standstill in a mess of desperate, confused good Samaritans. You laughing yet? Or what about tall skinny guy goes to parents' house at night, fills the lounge with geese, then leaves a cow's head on their bed, droning: \"This is a message from Don Corleone.\" </p> <p>How about now? </p> <p>There is, of course, a strong chance that you'll have said no to all of the above, in which case the strange charms of Tom Green, creator/host of The Tom Green Show and (occasionally) the funniest man in the world, will have failed to impress. So here's one last try. Tall skinny guy goes to doctor with swollen testicle. Finds out it's malignant. Finds out the lump may have spread. Tall skinny guy has cancer. Tall skinny guy goes to hospital. </p> <p>Now, that's got to raise a chuckle. </p> <p>Or so went the logic behind The Tom Green Cancer Special, the idiot provocateur's half-hour extravaganza - aired in the US last week, and sometime soon in Britain - wherein fans were treated to the all-too-real account of their hero's life-saving surgery. Among the many highlights, two of them included footage of the op, with podgy, bespectacled stooge Glenn Humplik gingerly fingering his boss's freshly removed appendage, and a snappy health education ditty, the lyrics of which ran along the bottom of the screen augmented by a bouncing tumorous bollock. </p> <p>You could call it gross, sick, offensive or infantile. You could also call it hard proof that the comedic impossible has finally happened. Tom Green has made cancer - his own dark, aggressive cancer - a laugh riot. </p> <p>Which would be entirely in keeping with everything the 28-year-old, rake-thin Canadian has been doing since ditching a putative rap career and launching himself on the airwaves (he was adopted by MTV early last year), making funny out of stuff which sounds, by turns, stupefying, crass and just plain weird. Sadly, print on paper can't quite do justice to the lunatic, sugar-rush hysteria of The Tom Green Show, the epitome of the edgy programming so often talked about by TV executives on both sides of the Atlantic, and so seldom glimpsed by viewers on either. </p> <p>From its typically imbecilic theme tune (\"This is the Tom Green Show / It's not the Green Tom Show / It is my favourite show / Because it is my show\") onward, Green's MO boils down to nothing more, or less, than - in his own words - \"shit happening and people getting freaked out\". </p> <p>There's Tom, bawling: \"Did you see the movie The Shawshank Redemption?\" at a fan-engine expert, over and over and over again. There's Tom, made up like a geriatric, careering round supermarket aisles in his motorised wheelchair. There's Tom, sucking milk straight from the udder, dating Monica Lewinsky, doing Marilyn Monroe impressions (thrift-shop dress, something yellow stuck on his head, face cream smeared across his body) at terrified passers-by. </p> <p>And there's Tom, forever plaguing his middle-aged folks Dick and Mary Jane, letting his real life spill over on screen like your average dumb-ass hoaxer would never have the balls to do. \"But you're my parents\", he tells them, shortly after unveiling a statue of ma and pa having anal sex on their front lawn. \"That's what's sad, Tom\", replies his father, shortly before threatening to sue. </p> <p>All of which works; partly because Green has the kind of natural deadpan swagger which makes pretty much anything work, and partly because his shtick taps into a vein of specifically North American comedy which sees humour where others only see humiliation. </p> <p>On one level, anyone searching for meaning behind the pranks will be sorely disappointed. The media-baiting agenda of a Chris Morris, for instance, is nowhere to be seen. </p> <p>On another, what makes Green special is his status as the anti-practical joker - rather than the cheap thrill of running up behind someone and shouting \"Boo!\", he comes up to their faces and screams \"Boo!\" until he's made to stop. For Green, it's not just about freaking people out, it's about freaking them out as long and as hard as you possibly can.

      "bodyText": "Here's a test. Tall skinny guy - we'll call him Tom Green - goes to a vet. He produces a carry case, opens it, pulls out a small, mangled hunk of roadkill which may once, long ago, have been a cat. Asks the vet if he can help. So, are you laughing? OK, how about this? Tall skinny guy goes out on crutches, falls over. Anyone tries to help, he screams in agony as the street grinds to a standstill in a mess of desperate, confused good Samaritans. You laughing yet? Or what about tall skinny guy goes to parents' house at night, fills the lounge with geese, then leaves a cow's head on their bed, droning: \"This is a message from Don Corleone.\" How about now? There is, of course, a strong chance that you'll have said no to all of the above, in which case the strange charms of Tom Green, creator/host of The Tom Green Show and (occasionally) the funniest man in the world, will have failed to impress. So here's one last try. Tall skinny guy goes to doctor with swollen testicle. Finds out it's malignant. Finds out the lump may have spread. Tall skinny guy has cancer. Tall skinny guy goes to hospital. Now, that's got to raise a chuckle. Or so went the logic behind The Tom Green Cancer Special, the idiot provocateur's half-hour extravaganza - aired in the US last week, and sometime soon in Britain - wherein fans were treated to the all-too-real account of their hero's life-saving surgery. Among the many highlights, two of them included footage of the op, with podgy, bespectacled stooge Glenn Humplik gingerly fingering his boss's freshly removed appendage, and a snappy health education ditty, the lyrics of which ran along the bottom of the screen augmented by a bouncing tumorous bollock. You could call it gross, sick, offensive or infantile. You could also call it hard proof that the comedic impossible has finally happened. Tom Green has made cancer - his own dark, aggressive cancer - a laugh riot. Which would be entirely in keeping with everything the 28-year-old, rake-thin Canadian has been doing since ditching a putative rap career and launching himself on the airwaves (he was adopted by MTV early last year), making funny out of stuff which sounds, by turns, stupefying, crass and just plain weird. Sadly, print on paper can't quite do justice to the lunatic, sugar-rush hysteria of The Tom Green Show, the epitome of the edgy programming so often talked about by TV executives on both sides of the Atlantic, and so seldom glimpsed by viewers on either. From its typically imbecilic theme tune (\"This is the Tom Green Show / It's not the Green Tom Show / It is my favourite show / Because it is my show\") onward, Green's MO boils down to nothing more, or less, than - in his own words - \"shit happening and people getting freaked out\". There's Tom, bawling: \"Did you see the movie The Shawshank Redemption?\" at a fan-engine expert, over and over and over again. There's Tom, made up like a geriatric, careering round supermarket aisles in his motorised wheelchair. There's Tom, sucking milk straight from the udder, dating Monica Lewinsky, doing Marilyn Monroe impressions (thrift-shop dress, something yellow stuck on his head, face cream smeared across his body) at terrified passers-by. And there's Tom, forever plaguing his middle-aged folks Dick and Mary Jane, letting his real life spill over on screen like your average dumb-ass hoaxer would never have the balls to do. \"But you're my parents\", he tells them, shortly after unveiling a statue of ma and pa having anal sex on their front lawn. \"That's what's sad, Tom\", replies his father, shortly before threatening to sue. All of which works; partly because Green has the kind of natural deadpan swagger which makes pretty much anything work, and partly because his shtick taps into a vein of specifically North American comedy which sees humour where others only see humiliation. On one level, anyone searching for meaning behind the pranks will be sorely disappointed. The media-baiting agenda of a Chris Morris, for instance, is nowhere to be seen. On another, what makes Green special is his status as the anti-practical joker - rather than the cheap thrill of running up behind someone and shouting \"Boo!\", he comes up to their faces and screams \"Boo!\" until he's made to stop. For Green, it's not just about freaking people out, it's about freaking them out as long and as hard as you possibly can. So if he makes any sense at all, it's as the antithesis of the neurotic, etiquette-obsessed Jerry Seinfeld. When the last thing anyone wants is to be stared at by strangers, you turn the situation on its head and invite them to either run or punch you out. Tom Green calls it flipping. Which is where the Cancer Special suddenly seems like the most natural thing in the world. Confronted with the ultimate nightmare scenario, you put it all down on tape and wait for your peers to be horrified, astonished or entertained as they see fit: gallows humour on the grandest, most brazen scale. The only problem, as with any genuinely innovative comedy, is the inevitability of lesser talents turning up after the event and pilfering the whole idea. Skinner and Baddiel's Cot Death Crazy Hour can only be weeks away. \u0095 The Tom Green Show is on MTV every week night at 10pm",

Jogging one afternoon in Martha's Vineyard, the eastern seaboard island, Fox was stopped by his wife, the actress Tracy Pollan, who had become alarmed. Fox recalls her saying: \"Get in the car.

It began somewhere behind my eyes, and quickly travelled back into my brain. I had a vague memory of the sensation, and as the burly characters hacked at one another inside a computer-rendered Roman Coliseum, I realised when I had experienced this same headache before: travelling to Jar-Jar Binks's underwater home city in Star Wars, The Phantom Menace. </p> <p>I have been similarly plagued by a kind of unsettling dizziness whenever I listen to MP3 music files - the format into which songs are compressed for easy downloading on the internet. The ease with which I can obtain music using programs like Napster is more than outweighed by my inability to listen to them. They don't sound like music at all to me, but like the idea of music. Shallow, fuzzy, and unreal. </p> <p>An increasing number of my friends are reporting the same phenomena. Could we be allergic to digital technology? Or are we simply too old for my brain to process and understand it? When we were kids, our parents used to complain about not being able to watch the quick-cut videos on MTV. We laughed at the inability of their ancient cerebral cortex to cope with the rapid-fire film grammar of the late 20th century. Could it be that we thirty-somethings are now in the same position? Are our brains obsolete? </p> <p>Perhaps. But a little research into the technologies behind today's digitally simulated sounds and visuals may just reveal the opposite. What's bothering our analogue-era senses is our ability to see and hear what's really going on. Digital graphics and audio compression routines amount to little more than tricks. Like those Magic Eye 3D pictures that require viewers to un-focus their eyes in order to perceive the illusion, today's digital trickery demands that we blur our senses to experience the simulation. </p> <p>In digitally generated movie scenes, for example, the individual objects are often rendered quite flawlessly. A graphic artist might slave for weeks on the shape and texture of a single sword or shield. It's when all the different parts are put together that digital filmmakers run into trouble, particularly when they're placing all these computer-rendered objects into a computer-rendered environment. </p> <p>As long as the objects are placed in a blank void, like the dark nothingness of space, our brains can cope. All we need to do in order to figure out what's going on is relate one spaceship to another against a black background. When digitally rendered objects are supposed to be moving around in real world environments, however, the simulation falls apart. </p> <p>The result looks about as real as a Hieronymous Bosch painting: a swarm of crisp images against an equally high-definition backdrop. And even though everything is moving about, reflecting light, and rotating in a way calculated to conform to the rules of three-dimensional motion, the whole image never quite comes together. The individual pictures are never made part of the same world. Our eyes and brains are supposed to make this leap, blurring it all together into a single event. When our sensory apparatus refuses to accept this compromise, pain is the result. </p> <p>The same is true for compressed digital music files. MP3 is not a simple digital sound format, but something known as a \"psycho-acoustic algorithm\". Rather than reproducing music as accurately as possible given its space constraints, a psycho-acoustic algorithm attempts to fool the brain into hearing what is not there. </p> <p>By eliminating the real overtones associated with different instruments and the environments in which they are being played, then replacing them with set of similar frequencies, MP3 files save a lot of space. The algorithm imitates some of the qualities of good sound production, even though it can't actually achieve it. Ultimately, our brain must use the sonic clues it receives to imagine the real musical event. We fill in the blank spots. </p> <p>Again, this might succeed with electronic music, which exists in a vacuum with no real world basis for comparison. But MP3 re-creations of recorded instruments and voices do not impact our body in the same way that a real recording does. Our brain might be fooled into believing that it's hearing an accurate reproduction of sound, but our body resonates about as much as it would with a cheap AM radio. It's the disparity between what we think we're hearing and what we're actually hearing that causes the confusion and discomfort. </p> <p>As market realities dictate the development of digital techniques, it may prove more economically efficient to push human perception towards the acceptance of these compromises. If the popularity of Napster is any indication, we already have. </p> <p>Hopefully, new digital techniques and formats will be developed that spend the processing power of our computers on reproduction instead of simulation. Until that time, however, I'd prefer it if such media came with warning labels: \"Digital simulations employed.\"</p>",

The parties exchanged angry letters over suggestions that each had dragged its feet in getting a bill on to the statute book which would restrict spending to almost \u00a320m over the 12 months before polling day, and ban foreign donations. As each insisted it would work to push through the political parties, elections and referendums bill - which has become bogged down in the end of session logjam in the Lords - it emerged that, even with cross party cooperation, the legislation could come into force only two months before a general election next May - the earliest likely date. That would mean the parties having to set their own agreed figure for how much of the permitted \u00a319.77m they could spend in the eight weeks the new act had applied. Last month 83 mainly Labour MPs signed a Commons motion calling for a lower spending limit of \u00a315m. Yesterday's row blew up after it emerged that the home secretary, Jack Straw, had written to the Tories and Liberal Democrats asking for views on the timing of the bill's implementation amid cross-party concern that the reforms needed would be time consuming. All three main parties are concerned that new restrictions, primarily the legal requirement that parties publish a full balance sheet showing who has given what amount for campaign funds, will mean changes to their rules and new procedures at local party level. Mr Straw wrote to the shadow leader of the House, Sir George Young: \"The particular question which I am seeking to explore is whether you see serious difficulty with the bill's controls being brought into force for a spring 2001 general election.\" Even if the bill does not become law before the next general election, the home secretary has powers to cap spending for three or six months before any early election.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Goodbye to videotape</strong><br> Hitachi is promising to take camcorders into a new dimension by launching a model that records on to mini DVDs. Due in October, the camcorder, which will retail for around \u00a31,300, can store up to an hour's worth of MPEG2 standard digital audio and video on an 80mm DVD-ram disc. </p> <p>The camcorder's trump card is its unique electronic album. This enables the user to instantly access various stages of the recording by touching a still image of the start of the footage on the model's LCD screen. </p> <p>Hitachi is unlikely to be the only manufacturer with a disc-based camcorder for long. Both Sony and Sharp are considering launching models that record on to newly developed high capacity MiniDiscs. </p> <p>In spite of its disc innovation Hitachi hasn't given up on tape-based camcorders. Due next month is the VM-D865LE which uses the Digital 8 system as pioneered by Sony. This offers digital recording on to analogue Hi8 cassettes. </p> <p><strong> An office in your pocket</strong><br> BT Cellnet has announced the June 26 launch of its GPRS high speed wireless data system for mobile phones - but only for business users. It is accompanied by the first GPRS service PocketNet Office, that gives users mobile access to their company's intranets. </p> <p>GPRS (General Packet Radio service), which has been dubbed G two and a half by the phone industry, delivers internet information at least five to 10 times as quickly as current GSM Wap (wireless application protocol) phones. </p> <p>The system also offers instant access to the internet as the phone is permanently connected to a data network - either a company LAN or an internet service provider. </p> <p>GPRS will significantly improve the speed and functionality of Wap services as well as offering access to full HTML pages. </p> <p>BT Cellnet's GPRS services will only be available to businesses with a large number of mobile phone users. They will pay a subscription fee of between \u00a335 and \u00a370 a month for a certain amount of download time. A GPRS-equipped version of Motorola's Timeport phone will be available for around \u00a3200, although businesses will also be able to invest in GPRS cards for their PCs. </p> <p>PocketNet Office, the first GPRS application to be rolled out by BT Cellnet, will allow users mobile access to their company intranets through a PC and a mobile phone. Previously these services could be accessed only via a fixed connection. </p> <p>BT Cellnet hopes to launch the consumer version of GPRS by the end of the year. </p> <p><strong> Nike</strong><br> Nike has created a new division dedicated to producing hi-tech gadgets for athletes. Due first is an MP3 player, the PSA/Play that goes on sale in the US next month and will reach the UK in October. </p> <p>It will be accompanied by two variations on the Nike Triax watch: one with a heart rate monitor and the other boasting an altimeter/ compass. </p> <p>Nike is also working on a clothing range with dedicated pockets for its gadgets. There's no news yet on MP3 equipped trainers, but we're keeping our fingers crossed. </p> <p><strong> Power to the portable</strong><br> Your kitchen trannie has finally succumbed to the digital revolution. Roberts Radio has announced the launch of the world's first portable digital radio. </p> <p>The Classic 2000 tunes into the DAB (digital audio broadcasting) network to deliver crystal clear versions of stations like BBC Radio 1-5 and Classic FM. The service also allows digital data to be transmitted simultaneously with audio signals. So, for example, the radio can display the name of the track and the artist while a tune is playing. </p> <p>The bad news is that the Classic 2000 costs \u00a3800 and is available only in very limited numbers. (AN)</p> <p> <strong>The price of fame</strong><br> It was billed as the loneliest phone box in the world - and now it's gone, thanks to the fame it found on the web. </p> <p>From the 1960s this fully functioning Pacific Bell phone box stood in the middle of the Mojave desert in California, at the junction of two dead-end desert tracks. It was 15 miles from the nearest main road, and a million miles from anyone's thoughts. </p> <p>That was until a website owner chanced upon a reference to the box in a magazine in 1997, and began calling every day in the hope someone might answer. </p> <p>It took a month of daily dialling, but eventually someone did answer - and an obsession was born. </p> <p>Over the years, more and more people heard of the <a href=\"http://www.deuceofclubs.com/moj/mojave1.htm\">Mojave Phone Booth site</a> and began calling - and visiting - the phone box themselves. </p> <p>But after three years of rapidly growing web-fuelled fame Pacific Bell, the box's owner, said in a joint statement with the Mojave National Preserve that \"increased public traffic had a negative impact on the desert environment\". It had been installed only because of a legal requirement to provide phones in remote locales. But its removal has sparked an outcry, in the park and on the web. </p> <p>Phone calls to the booth's number - 001 760 733-9969 - are now greeted by a recorded message. (NM)</p> <p><strong> Protected by prints</strong><br> An MI5 trainee agent gets drunk in a tapas bar and leaves her laptop behind. A government official has a laptop stolen crammed with details of a new top-secret Stealth fighter. </p> <p>The ease with which laptops containing sensitive information are proving a security headache for governments and companies.

      "bodyText": "Goodbye to videotape Hitachi is promising to take camcorders into a new dimension by launching a model that records on to mini DVDs. Due in October, the camcorder, which will retail for around \u00a31,300, can store up to an hour's worth of MPEG2 standard digital audio and video on an 80mm DVD-ram disc. The camcorder's trump card is its unique electronic album. This enables the user to instantly access various stages of the recording by touching a still image of the start of the footage on the model's LCD screen. Hitachi is unlikely to be the only manufacturer with a disc-based camcorder for long. Both Sony and Sharp are considering launching models that record on to newly developed high capacity MiniDiscs. In spite of its disc innovation Hitachi hasn't given up on tape-based camcorders. Due next month is the VM-D865LE which uses the Digital 8 system as pioneered by Sony. This offers digital recording on to analogue Hi8 cassettes. An office in your pocket BT Cellnet has announced the June 26 launch of its GPRS high speed wireless data system for mobile phones - but only for business users. It is accompanied by the first GPRS service PocketNet Office, that gives users mobile access to their company's intranets. GPRS (General Packet Radio service), which has been dubbed G two and a half by the phone industry, delivers internet information at least five to 10 times as quickly as current GSM Wap (wireless application protocol) phones. The system also offers instant access to the internet as the phone is permanently connected to a data network - either a company LAN or an internet service provider. GPRS will significantly improve the speed and functionality of Wap services as well as offering access to full HTML pages. BT Cellnet's GPRS services will only be available to businesses with a large number of mobile phone users. They will pay a subscription fee of between \u00a335 and \u00a370 a month for a certain amount of download time. A GPRS-equipped version of Motorola's Timeport phone will be available for around \u00a3200, although businesses will also be able to invest in GPRS cards for their PCs. PocketNet Office, the first GPRS application to be rolled out by BT Cellnet, will allow users mobile access to their company intranets through a PC and a mobile phone. Previously these services could be accessed only via a fixed connection. BT Cellnet hopes to launch the consumer version of GPRS by the end of the year. Nike Nike has created a new division dedicated to producing hi-tech gadgets for athletes. Due first is an MP3 player, the PSA/Play that goes on sale in the US next month and will reach the UK in October. It will be accompanied by two variations on the Nike Triax watch: one with a heart rate monitor and the other boasting an altimeter/ compass. Nike is also working on a clothing range with dedicated pockets for its gadgets. There's no news yet on MP3 equipped trainers, but we're keeping our fingers crossed. Power to the portable Your kitchen trannie has finally succumbed to the digital revolution. Roberts Radio has announced the launch of the world's first portable digital radio. The Classic 2000 tunes into the DAB (digital audio broadcasting) network to deliver crystal clear versions of stations like BBC Radio 1-5 and Classic FM. The service also allows digital data to be transmitted simultaneously with audio signals. So, for example, the radio can display the name of the track and the artist while a tune is playing. The bad news is that the Classic 2000 costs \u00a3800 and is available only in very limited numbers. (AN) The price of fame It was billed as the loneliest phone box in the world - and now it's gone, thanks to the fame it found on the web. From the 1960s this fully functioning Pacific Bell phone box stood in the middle of the Mojave desert in California, at the junction of two dead-end desert tracks. It was 15 miles from the nearest main road, and a million miles from anyone's thoughts. That was until a website owner chanced upon a reference to the box in a magazine in 1997, and began calling every day in the hope someone might answer. It took a month of daily dialling, but eventually someone did answer - and an obsession was born. Over the years, more and more people heard of the Mojave Phone Booth site and began calling - and visiting - the phone box themselves. But after three years of rapidly growing web-fuelled fame Pacific Bell, the box's owner, said in a joint statement with the Mojave National Preserve that \"increased public traffic had a negative impact on the desert environment\". It had been installed only because of a legal requirement to provide phones in remote locales. But its removal has sparked an outcry, in the park and on the web. Phone calls to the booth's number - 001 760 733-9969 - are now greeted by a recorded message. (NM) Protected by prints An MI5 trainee agent gets drunk in a tapas bar and leaves her laptop behind. A government official has a laptop stolen crammed with details of a new top-secret Stealth fighter. The ease with which laptops containing sensitive information are proving a security headache for governments and companies. One solution being offered is to make the machines fingerprint sensitive so they will respond only to an authorised user. Such a system is being offered by Veridicom, a US company spun off in 1997 from Lucent/Bell Labs, the telecommunications manufacturer. The system is based on a small silicon sensor which captures the image of a fingerprint then identifies details unique to it - ridge endings and bifurcations -and stores the information as a template. Anyone wanting to use the computer must offer a fingerprint for a live reading. The sensor compares the print to the information that was stored. If the data match, access to the computer is allowed. Other security systems are on the market, notably optical scanners featured in the Mission Impossible movie. But Veridicom believes it has the edge over optical systems because fingerprint sensors are cheaper, smaller and easier to integrate. See www.veridicom.com. (MT)",

As well as three modes of play (practice, single race, and tournament), you can choose from five types of race, 70 different tracks, 22 bikes, four multiplayer modes, and a zillion colour schemes. The partridge in a pear tree hadn't surfaced at the time of writing, but I wouldn't bet against it. </p> <p>You can custom-build your own bike, and fine-tune any of the pre-set models.You can watch the action from an astonishing number of angles (as if staying on two wheels wasn't challenging enough), and even take your opponents' point of view. </p> <p>The possibilities, then, are almost endless: the question is, will anyone be inclined to explore them all? </p> <p>There are two ways of approaching the game, depending on the kind of race: go for all-out speed, or pull off the most sensational stunts. The game mechanics are weighted more towards the stunts, and these appear (to the non-motocrossed eye, at least) to be fairly well realised. The catch is that, in terms of execution, there's no real difficulty curve - once you've mastered one stunt, you've mastered them all. </p> <p>More serious objections arise with the load times - you could do the hoovering and the dusting in the time it takes to start one race, even with a full install - and the graphics, which (oddly enough, coming as this does from Microsoft) are disagreeably reminiscent of a flight simulator. </p> <p>But if dirt bikes and/or showing off yank your chain, this is probably the best you can hope for. (AB)</p> <p><strong> Evil gets really wicked<br> Resident Evil: Code Veronica</strong><br> Dreamcast \u00a339.99 Capcom/Eidos **** <br> Marketing men will tell you that Resident Evil is a triple-A brand. Any game released under this banner will storm the charts, bringing comfort to retailers and industry types everywhere. Unfortunately, this can lead to a certain overspreading of the jam- see the execrable Resident Evil: Survivor for a case in point. </p> <p>Until recently, the Dreamcast had remained free of obscure puzzles, fixed camera angles and the undead, but following April's conversion of Resident Evil 2 comes the first proper \"next-generation\" instalment - Resident Evil: Code Veronica. This is the fifth game in the series and undoubtedly the best. Gone are the rendered backdrops of yore, replaced by gorgeous real-time locales where you can freely interact with the surroundings. </p> <p>Even the camera has been released from its positional vice. As it swoops this way and that, you never know quite what is behind the next corner, and at 1am, with the lights off and the sound up, there are enough shocks to scare any cynical doubters. </p> <p>The sound is crucial, too. Stuttering heartbeats and creaky doors combine with superb lighting effects, making for some tense moments. </p> <p>However, it's not all action. While there are still zombies everywhere, the puzzle aspect has been beefed up, and thankfully, the conundrums seem more logical than before. </p> <p>Sadly, the controls remain defiantly un-analogue, but with most Dreamcast games requiring the attention span of a gnat, it's satisfying to play a game on the console that does not need the reflexes of a 12-year-old cola addict.

More serious objections arise with the load times - you could do the hoovering and the dusting in the time it takes to start one race, even with a full install - and the graphics, which (oddly enough, coming as this does from Microsoft) are disagreeably reminiscent of a flight simulator. But if dirt bikes and/or showing off yank your chain, this is probably the best you can hope for. (AB) Evil gets really wicked Resident Evil: Code Veronica Dreamcast \u00a339.99 Capcom/Eidos **** Marketing men will tell you that Resident Evil is a triple-A brand. Any game released under this banner will storm the charts, bringing comfort to retailers and industry types everywhere. Unfortunately, this can lead to a certain overspreading of the jam- see the execrable Resident Evil: Survivor for a case in point. Until recently, the Dreamcast had remained free of obscure puzzles, fixed camera angles and the undead, but following April's conversion of Resident Evil 2 comes the first proper \"next-generation\" instalment - Resident Evil: Code Veronica. This is the fifth game in the series and undoubtedly the best. Gone are the rendered backdrops of yore, replaced by gorgeous real-time locales where you can freely interact with the surroundings. Even the camera has been released from its positional vice. As it swoops this way and that, you never know quite what is behind the next corner, and at 1am, with the lights off and the sound up, there are enough shocks to scare any cynical doubters. The sound is crucial, too. Stuttering heartbeats and creaky doors combine with superb lighting effects, making for some tense moments. However, it's not all action. While there are still zombies everywhere, the puzzle aspect has been beefed up, and thankfully, the conundrums seem more logical than before. Sadly, the controls remain defiantly un-analogue, but with most Dreamcast games requiring the attention span of a gnat, it's satisfying to play a game on the console that does not need the reflexes of a 12-year-old cola addict.

      "body": "<p><strong> Small but snappy</strong><br> <strong> Agfa ePhoto CL18 camera</strong> \u00a399 plus VAT <br> </p> <p> Agfa's ePhoto CL18 - a palm-sized digital camera for snaps and videoconferencing - isn't exactly disposable. But at \u00a399 plus VAT, it could reach a new market of people for whom existing models are both too expensive and too hard to use. </p> <p>This is unashamedly a snapshot camera, and it has the minimum number of controls. The main decision you have to take is whether to push the button to set the so-called High Quality mode - 640 by 480 pixels, the same as a VGA screen, in 24-bit colour - or use Standard Quality. </p> <p>HQ lets you take 16 pictures before the memory is full, while SQ lets you take 32 before you have to download the results to a PC. </p> <p>Sorry, no removable storage so you can keep shooting. Sorry, no colour screen on the back so you can see what you have taken. Sorry, no zoom lens. The CL18 does have a small monochrome LCD screen for numeric read-outs, but just about the only extras are the 10 second self-timer and the built-in multi-mode flash. </p> <p>But, the CL18 does have more potential than this suggests. It comes with a video cable so you can display your pictures on a TV screen, either PAL or NTSC. It also comes with a fast USB cable and a tiny tripod, so that you can use it for video conferencing, for capturing video images, and as a webcam. All these features rely on connecting the CL18 to a PC running Microsoft Windows 98. </p> <p>While there are cheaper webcams for video-conferencing with Microsoft NetMeeting, the CL18's advantage is that it works as a snapshot camera as well. And while its 0.3 megapixel resolution may look weedy compared to the 3.3 megapixel beasts now taking over the camera market, it's certainly good enough for most web page uses. </p> <p>The CL18 also comes with a selection of software on CD-rom, including Corel Photo House 5 image-editing software and Corel Print Office 2000. </p> <p>Bare facts: The Agfa ePhoto CL18 measures 95 x 65 x 35mm and weighs 120g (4.2oz) without its two AA batteries. It has 2MB of non-removable Flash memory that can hold from 16 to 32 colour pictures, depending on resolution. </p> <p>The fixed focus f/2 lens is the equivalent of a 45mm lens and provides sharp pictures from 50cm (20in) to infinity. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Small but snappy Agfa ePhoto CL18 camera \u00a399 plus VAT Agfa's ePhoto CL18 - a palm-sized digital camera for snaps and videoconferencing - isn't exactly disposable. But at \u00a399 plus VAT, it could reach a new market of people for whom existing models are both too expensive and too hard to use. This is unashamedly a snapshot camera, and it has the minimum number of controls. The main decision you have to take is whether to push the button to set the so-called High Quality mode - 640 by 480 pixels, the same as a VGA screen, in 24-bit colour - or use Standard Quality. HQ lets you take 16 pictures before the memory is full, while SQ lets you take 32 before you have to download the results to a PC. Sorry, no removable storage so you can keep shooting. Sorry, no colour screen on the back so you can see what you have taken. Sorry, no zoom lens. The CL18 does have a small monochrome LCD screen for numeric read-outs, but just about the only extras are the 10 second self-timer and the built-in multi-mode flash. But, the CL18 does have more potential than this suggests. It comes with a video cable so you can display your pictures on a TV screen, either PAL or NTSC. It also comes with a fast USB cable and a tiny tripod, so that you can use it for video conferencing, for capturing video images, and as a webcam. All these features rely on connecting the CL18 to a PC running Microsoft Windows 98. While there are cheaper webcams for video-conferencing with Microsoft NetMeeting, the CL18's advantage is that it works as a snapshot camera as well. And while its 0.3 megapixel resolution may look weedy compared to the 3.3 megapixel beasts now taking over the camera market, it's certainly good enough for most web page uses. The CL18 also comes with a selection of software on CD-rom, including Corel Photo House 5 image-editing software and Corel Print Office 2000. Bare facts: The Agfa ePhoto CL18 measures 95 x 65 x 35mm and weighs 120g (4.2oz) without its two AA batteries. It has 2MB of non-removable Flash memory that can hold from 16 to 32 colour pictures, depending on resolution. The fixed focus f/2 lens is the equivalent of a 45mm lens and provides sharp pictures from 50cm (20in) to infinity.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Sometimes victory dampens expectation rather than boosts it. Any hopes the England and Wales Cricket Board may have harboured that England's annihilation of Zimbabwe at Lord's would enourage the citizens of Nottingham to pack out Trent Bridge, this smallest of English test grounds, for today's second test have been rudely dashed by the news that only 16,000 tickets have been sold. </p> <p>The sluggish advance sales may be a reflection on the weather forecast - vile for the first two days and not too shabby thereafter - but are more likely a comment on the abject surrender of the visitors in the first Test. </p> <p>To the majority this match merely completes the hors d'oeuvre before the main course, which swaggered into London from the Caribbean yesterday on the back of a fantastic win in Antigua. </p> <p>West Indies cricket has been resurrected this past few months and under Jimmy Adams they will provide a substantially sterner test than Zimbabwe. The England captain Nasser Hussain recognises the dangers in getting too blas\u00e9 about the Lord's demolition and its relationship to England's prospects of finally nailing West Indies. </p> <p>\"Don't make too much of it,\" he warned. \"They are here just off a win, are fully behind their captain, have four good quick bowlers, some batters coming into form, including some good young players, and one oldish left-hander coming in as well. It will be a tough battle for us.\" </p> <p>Indeed it will and the preparation, which began at Lord's, continues in this match where England will be looking to win their third successive test. The notion was presented to Hussain that, for purposes of pre-Windies practice, he would hope the opposition to be more competitive this time round. </p> <p>\"I don't hope,\" he retorted sharply, \"I expect it of them. They will be hurt after Lord's but they are a good side with some top players and they will come back at us. They feel they let themselves down at Lord's but this is their last Test for a while and they want to round things off in good spirits. We expect it but it's how we react to it which is important. </p> <p>\"There are no easy games in Test cricket, especially for us. So we have to get as much confidence and team spirit as we can from this game, with batsmen spending time in the middle and with each other so that we have something special to carry forward to the rest of the summer.\" </p> <p>As at Lord's, Hussain will wait until this morning before finalising his side.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes victory dampens expectation rather than boosts it. Any hopes the England and Wales Cricket Board may have harboured that England's annihilation of Zimbabwe at Lord's would enourage the citizens of Nottingham to pack out Trent Bridge, this smallest of English test grounds, for today's second test have been rudely dashed by the news that only 16,000 tickets have been sold. The sluggish advance sales may be a reflection on the weather forecast - vile for the first two days and not too shabby thereafter - but are more likely a comment on the abject surrender of the visitors in the first Test. To the majority this match merely completes the hors d'oeuvre before the main course, which swaggered into London from the Caribbean yesterday on the back of a fantastic win in Antigua. West Indies cricket has been resurrected this past few months and under Jimmy Adams they will provide a substantially sterner test than Zimbabwe. The England captain Nasser Hussain recognises the dangers in getting too blas\u00e9 about the Lord's demolition and its relationship to England's prospects of finally nailing West Indies. \"Don't make too much of it,\" he warned. \"They are here just off a win, are fully behind their captain, have four good quick bowlers, some batters coming into form, including some good young players, and one oldish left-hander coming in as well. It will be a tough battle for us.\" Indeed it will and the preparation, which began at Lord's, continues in this match where England will be looking to win their third successive test. The notion was presented to Hussain that, for purposes of pre-Windies practice, he would hope the opposition to be more competitive this time round. \"I don't hope,\" he retorted sharply, \"I expect it of them. They will be hurt after Lord's but they are a good side with some top players and they will come back at us. They feel they let themselves down at Lord's but this is their last Test for a while and they want to round things off in good spirits. We expect it but it's how we react to it which is important. \"There are no easy games in Test cricket, especially for us. So we have to get as much confidence and team spirit as we can from this game, with batsmen spending time in the middle and with each other so that we have something special to carry forward to the rest of the summer.\" As at Lord's, Hussain will wait until this morning before finalising his side. On that occasion he opted for Chris Schofield's wrist spin rather than the pace of Steve Harmison. Schofield, of course, did not turn his arm over as Darren Gough, Andy Caddick and Ed Giddins cleaned up. Hussain likes balance but at Lord's his indecision with the toss (he apparently did not make up his mind until the coin was in the air) indicates that he may have misread the pitch, underestimating the dampness of the sub-surface. This pitch, he reckons, is not dissimilar in terms of grass cover (even) and moisture (dry on top but sodden underneath, if the spongy outfield is anything to go by). So, with rain about, it could be expected to play similarly, even to the extent of swinging, an influence of the new stand at the Radcliffe Road end. Knowing Hussain's inclinations the chances are that England will name that rare species, an unchanged side. However, if the seamers are going to dominate once more, the presence of Schofield would be irrelevant. West Indies in their heyday never worried about the lack of a spinner and, while shying away from the notion of experiment - Hussain recognises that his side do not have the clout to try that sort of thing - it would be better to give Harmison a debut and the chance to experience test cricket before West Indies, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Australia front up to England. Zimbabwe's injury worries were eased partially yesterday, with Pommie Mbangwa and Bryan Strang declared fit, although Henry Olonga was still hobbling. They have made changes to the top of their order, however. Guy Whittall is set to open with Grant Flower and Trevor Gripper has been dropped for Stuart Carlisle. Alistair Campbell, who has played 28 innings in the last two years with a top score of 36 and an average of 13.2, retains his place.",

Certainly McManaman saw a lot of the ball and ran willingly at the opposition, but his options were reduced by the lack of movement around him and the paucity of service from the wings.

Two minutes before half-time Shearer's persistence forced a corner on the right, taken by Beckham. Shearer met it with a firm downward header which Kernozenko blocked but could not hold. Fowler drove the rebound into the net and must have felt he had assured himself of a place in Euro 2000. </p> <p>In the second half it was the turn of Emile Heskey, whose selection for the final 22 was less in doubt but who needed more time to hone up the partnership with Shearer. </p> <p>Before Heskey had time to settle down, however, Shevchenko had drawn the first save of the evening from Martyn, a sharp shot on the turn which England's goalkeeper cut out at the near post. </p> <p>Six minutes later Shevchenko met Oleg Luzhny's cross the right with a downward header which Martyn kept out, this time diving to tip it away with his left hand.

And last night Nigel Martyn and Steven Gerrard proved themslves admirable alternatives while Robbie Fowler's goal against Ukraine confirmed the match sharpness Keegan had been seeking from the Liverpool striker.</p> <p>The form of the 20-year-old Michael Owen is crucial and much in the European Championship will depend on the quality of service that he and Shearer receive. Keegan knows he can depend on a regular delivery of high-class centres, free-kicks and corners from Beckham on the right.</p> <p>Yet there is no specialist left-winger in the squad and the England coach will be heavily reliant on Paul Scholes, who played well against Ukraine, providing a strong attacking presence through the middle. He also has reason to be worried about the poverty of the passing from the back.</p> <p>The main weaknesses of this squad compared to 1998 are that there is no Graeme Le Saux to give England natural width on the left, no Teddy Sheringham to link up the play and no Darren Anderton to add penetration on the right while posing an equal threat through the middle. Additionally, England's weakness in the full-back positions will never be completely overcome simply by shifting players around.</p> <p>Never has the need to pass the ball accurately and imaginatively been more apparent. The pass master in this squad is Chelsea's Dennis Wise. Could he be the keystone that holds England's performances in Euro 2000 together?</p> <p>Certainly, if England start giving the ball away, they can find themselves running around with the blind panic of the Keystone Cops, and Graham Taylor gave us enough slapstick in the 1992 European Championship to last a lifetime.</p>",

Keegan knows he can depend on a regular delivery of high-class centres, free-kicks and corners from Beckham on the right. Yet there is no specialist left-winger in the squad and the England coach will be heavily reliant on Paul Scholes, who played well against Ukraine, providing a strong attacking presence through the middle. He also has reason to be worried about the poverty of the passing from the back. The main weaknesses of this squad compared to 1998 are that there is no Graeme Le Saux to give England natural width on the left, no Teddy Sheringham to link up the play and no Darren Anderton to add penetration on the right while posing an equal threat through the middle. Additionally, England's weakness in the full-back positions will never be completely overcome simply by shifting players around. Never has the need to pass the ball accurately and imaginatively been more apparent. The pass master in this squad is Chelsea's Dennis Wise. Could he be the keystone that holds England's performances in Euro 2000 together? Certainly, if England start giving the ball away, they can find themselves running around with the blind panic of the Keystone Cops, and Graham Taylor gave us enough slapstick in the 1992 European Championship to last a lifetime.",
