The main themes were 'modernisation' and 'constitutional reform', and nobody ever stormed a Winter Palace under slogans like that. Nor did anyone compose a song to the effect that the people's flag was deeply prudent.</p> <p>Yet in the past year, Mr Blair has made such extravagant promises that one sometimes wonders if he has taken leave of his senses. More, one doubts his grasp of either arithmetic or economics. At the Labour Party conference last autumn, we had the promise to abolish child poverty in a generation. Then on David Frost's sofa one Sunday in January, in the midst of a flu crisis (which figures now reveal to have been a real one, though people accused Ministers of talking it up in order to disguise inadequacies in the NHS), we had the promise to bring the proportion of GDP spent on health up to the European average. Now the Guardian reports 'an audacious strategy' to abolish NHS waiting lists.</p> <p>Each promise, in its way, is preposterous. Poverty is usually defined as living on less than half the national average income; the quickest way to reduce poverty, therefore, is to soak the rich with taxation at levels that one would expect Mr Blair to judge politically unacceptable. Bringing health spending up to the European average requires a rise of at least one-third from present levels (I say 'at least' since there is nothing to stop other European countries increasing their spending, as they have done consistently for the last 20 years, thus raising the standard Mr Blair has to reach). Abolishing waiting lists requires the repeal of a fundamental law of economics: that scarce resources must be rationed in some way and if they are not rationed by price or by some other means (such as a judgment that some cases are more deserving than others) they must be rationed by queuing. This is not to say that queuing is necessarily a bad thing - since almost anyone can take their place in a queue, it is probably the most democratic and egalitarian means of distributing resources - merely to observe that, where services are offered free, it is almost an inevitability.</p> <p>So Mr Blair's promises remind me of the agendas for journalists' union conferences that I attended some 20 years ago. These were packed with motions requiring the union leadership to bring an 'immediate' end to the British 'occupation' of Northern Ireland, to 'oppose' American 'imperialism', and such like. The leadership would usually rule these out of order on the grounds that they were 'incapable of implementation'. Mr Blair's big ideas are likewise incapable of implementation.</p> <p>Is that a bad thing? Not at all. Any political or religious movement needs a compass, something to give it bearings, benchmarks against which it can judge its mundane, day-to-day choices. Christians have been striving for the Kingdom of Heaven for 2,000 years; it is not expected to arrive, as the Americans would put it, any time soon. Labour used to have its Clause 4; but nobody seriously thought that the workers by hand or by brain would ever control significant sectors of industry. Margaret Thatcher aimed to roll back the state and to reduce the burden of taxation. She came nowhere near either aim (if anything, she was further away from her goals when she left office than when she entered it) but at least the country understood her intentions and, for that reason, she changed, for better or worse, the national culture.</p> <p>The weakness of Mr Blair's mysterious Third Way has always been its lack of such sense of direction; we can see the roads he doesn't want to travel far more clearly than the one he does. Long before Labour came to power, I remember discussing with a senior New Labour adviser how a left-wing government could give civil servants a simple guiding light, something that would concentrate their thoughts and channel their mental energies. Thatcher's governments, the adviser observed, were guided by a very simple question: 'How can we create a market?' That dominated everything Whitehall did; Ministers and civil servants knew, when they started to frame policy, that anything that failed to address that question was doomed. What would be the equivalent for Labour? Something like 'how can we increase equality of opportunity?' we thought - though, somehow, that didn't seem precise enough or bold enough? But over the past three years, I fear, the question has been nothing more than 'how can we avoid offending middle England?' or 'how can we get a good headline in the Sun or the Daily Mail ?' Just as no Tory policy got beyond the starting blocks without passing the market test, so no New Labour policy gets anywhere without passing the David Yelland/Paul Dacre test.</p> <p>The Thatcher formula led, to be sure, to absurdities, notably the internal market in the NHS and, long after Thatcher herself had left office, the botched privatisation of the railways. Mr Blair's initial popularity was based, in part, on his resistance to politics driven by ideology.</p> <p>But I do not think that, in the end, politics can flourish unless the voters are offered some clarity of goals. It is said that people become cynical when politicians make impossible promises and then fail to achieve them. I think they become more cynical when the promises are circumscribed and technical. Was it, for example, so clever of New Labour to promise that the under-sevens in state schools would be taught in classes of fewer than 30, knowing, first, that class sizes in the private sector are enormously lower and, second, that to achieve this aim within available resources, older pupils would have to be taught in even larger classes?</p> <p>To reduce politics to questions of management (Blair's 'what works?') is to reduce it to little more than the kind of choice we make between gas appliances or video recorders or a new pair of shoes. It tells people that politics can make only a marginal difference to their lives, that it doesn't really deal in big ideas at all. That is essentially the message from the Clinton presidency (where the Third Way trail was blazed), with the result that less than half the eligible population voted in 1996. And despite the attempts to jazz up politics in Britain - directly-elected mayors, polling stations open for several days, more postal voting - the same message is emerging here, with the turnout only 33.6 per cent in the London mayoral elections, supposedly the most exciting contest for years.</p> <p>That is bound to worry a Labour Government because low turnouts invariably favour governments of the Right. But all politicians should be worried, not that they are failing to sell their own particular parties, but that they are failing to sell democratic politics as a source of idealism and inspiration.</p> <p>I hope that the Nineties - in which just about the most memorable political idea, because of its sheer banality, was John Major's cones hotline - will turn out to have been an aberration. I hope that politicians can once more engage our deepest feelings and deepest prejudices, bringing angry voices to the radio phone-ins and the newspaper letters columns, as the Oxbridge entry issue has done over the past two weeks. I hope that Tony Blair continues to make reckless promises and that Gordon Brown continues to wage class war.

And here the Government's lack of an overarching philosophy and political coherence is undermining its capacity to achieve the end that it wants. Promises of more spending, shorter waiting-lists and a tougher regime for consultants are all welcome as far as they go, but the problems are much more deep-seated. The NHS is suffering a gathering crisis of legitimacy. Patients and the public at large want a voice and a systematic framework in which they can trust that high quality health care is assured over time. </p> <p>Yet what is on offer is an increasingly politicised service where effective decision-making is still tightly held at the centre and where some of the policies, notably the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) as it operates in health, are undermining the equality and evenness of provision that the Government seeks. </p> <p>Three recent events underline the problem; more lie ahead. There is the exercise in public consultation - the so-called health census - to inform the National Plan for Health that has been exposed as little more than a PR stunt. There is the extraordinary fight to prevent the downgrading of Kidderminster General Hospital (part of a larger PFI deal for the nearby Worcester Royal Infirmary), where 19 out of 42 seats on the local district council are held by independent, newly elected councillors who, as members of 'Health Concern', are pledged to fight the plans and are bringing their protest to London next week in a street march. And there is the growing public dismay at medical incompetence, highlighted again by last week's Ritchie Report into Rodney Ledward, the Kent consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician who, over a 16-year career, maimed and harmed any number of women through botched operations. </p> <p>At first glance, these cases might seem unconnected, yet what binds them together is the great accountability gap that sits in the NHS as a brooding cancer. As long as it remains unaddressed, it will expose the contradictions that beset the Government's NHS policies. </p> <p>The unprecedented scale of the consultation exercise being mounted before the publication of the National Plan for Health in July is a tacit recognition of the accountability gap. The country's surgeries and supermarkets have been flooded by 12 million leaflets inviting us to identify the three key things we want from the NHS. These have to be completed and sent back by Monday at the latest, a week from start to finish. </p> <p>However, as Mori's Bob Worcester has said, this is not a serious exercise in finding out what the public wants or the trade-offs it might make between varying claims on NHS resources; that would require intense quantitative and qualitative research. Rather, it is a high-profile exercise in trying to demonstrate that the Government is 'listening', even though it knows the results will be unrepresentative and profoundly compromised by the tight time-scale. But it needs to show that readiness because nothing less will do in today's democratic climate. </p> <p>Automatic deference to authority is steadily weakening. We live in more democratic times, where everybody believes their voice should be heard. Legitimacy, by government, line manager or NHS consultant has to be earned. The Ledward case, together with the palpable weakness of both NHS managers and the General Medical Council alike in dealing with this rogue consultant, is another nail in that coffin. </p> <p>Ledward, like Harold Shipman, may be an exception, but the reality is that the system did not catch either early enough and in today's climate such deficiencies are no longer acceptable. The Ritchie Report assembles an impressive list of reforms, bolstering NHS complaints procedures which should be extended to the private sector and calling for beefed-up powers for the General Medical Council. And the Government has responded by saying either reform is in train or it will be. </p> <p>But as with the census, the larger democratic point is missed. The reason why the health ombudsman is weak, complaints procedures are feeble and regulation is delegated to the medical profession in the shape of the General Medical Council is not some accident - it is because the British doctrine is that accountability lies with the Minister in Parliament and that any other mechanism might challenge that ultimate authority. Thus the ombudsman is kept weak because he or she might challenge the authority of the Minister. There is a linear connection between British constitutional arrangements and Ledward's capacity to practise. </p> <p>This doctrine is not going to be challenged by New Labour. Instead, the party rel ishes the control it confers; the centre can thus control the terms of the health debate while offering a patina of accountability through consultation exercises like the national census or patients' focus groups. This allows polices like the PFI to be protected, which would not otherwise survive the scrutiny of the democratic rough house. </p> <p>Yet Kidderminster gives the lie even to this proposition. To scale down Kidderminster General so that it no longer offers in-patient beds, and diverting patients to Worcester, whose Royal Infirmary is being replaced with a PFI hospital that can only afford three-fifths of the existing acute beds, is outrageous. This is not a plan to improve Worcester's health provision that has been driven by Worcester's health needs, settled by open argument. Rather, it is a top-down scheme imposed upon the county by the exigencies of offering private contractors their appropriate financial returns within impossibly tight public-sector expenditure constraints. </p> <p>Yet the democratic voice cannot be suppressed. Alan Milburn dares not visit Worcester for fear the cameras might catch him with the protesters; next week, the stakes will be higher again as they carry their protest to London. And this is not the Socialist Workers Party; this is middle England in force. </p> <p>The Government really does want to deliver a better NHS. New money, new schemes and renegotiating the deal with consultants are helpful, but they will not crack the problem. To do that it must close the accountability deficit, with all that implies - delegating power, toughening up regulations, offering elections to health boards and accepting that if the PFI changes the fundamental character of the hospital service, then it must be reformed. It means nothing less than a democratic constitution for the health service, the case the commission I chaired recommended six weeks ago. Our case gets stronger by the day.</p>",

I hope to demonstrate to them that republicans will not discriminate. I hope to demonstrate that republicanism is capable of embracing all creeds and cultures on this island and harnessing the good from all of them for the benefit of society as a whole.</p> <p>I hope that by successfully exercising our responsibilities, all of the Ministers in the Executive - from whatever party - will demonstrate that Irish people are capable of self-government. We do not need English, Scottish, Welsh or any other nationality's Ministers coming here to dictate how we should govern any part of our country. I hope that by showing unionists that together we can deliver good government through our own abilities that they will have the confidence to recognise that, along with our brothers and sisters in the rest of the country, we can make this island the envy of our neighbours.</p> <p>I started back in my department at the beginning of last week and I intend to take up where I left off; that is trying to make a difference where it will make the most impact for those most in need.</p> <p>When I returned, I said that it was great to be back - and I meant it. I was coming back with the added advantage of the experience from the short period in office earlier in the year. We had begun much good work and established a good working relationship within the department and the wider education sector. I look forward to building on this solid foundation.</p> <p>In my role as Education Minister, I hope to be seen as a 'builder' in this evolving process. There are, of course, many challenges ahead but I believe that we are capable of laying down sound foundations for the future.

In our own situation, moving away from a climate of conflict and division, education has a key role to play in creating an inclusive, tolerant and stable society.

All of a sudden, he let go and took his first unsteady steps unsupported. After the excitement at the wondrous moment had subsided and we had settled back to more mundane things, I began to think about the significance of that first step and how it could be applied to the present political situation. I thought to myself - if unionist leaders could just look at the result of last week's vote at the Ulster Unionist Council as them letting go of the furniture and taking that first step towards a new and equal society, it could be a major step towards building trust with the republican/nationalist community. Likewise, the republican/nationalist community must let go of the furniture as well and take the first step towards trusting that unionists are changing and that they no longer want to dominate and discriminate against us. We must learn to walk together, to work together and build a future together in which our children and grandchildren can live in a society where religion and political persuasion does not determine where they live, play, be educated or work. As an Irish republican, I will continue to work towards the day when we have an Irish Republic free from interference, from the political influence, of a British government. I want to see a new Ireland where equality is the foundation of society.

A bright blip on his screen suggested there was a very large object travelling at 3,000mph over the Scottish coastline heading south-west to Belfast.</p> <p>The size of the blip suggested the object was 10 miles long and two miles wide. Two minutes later the object disappeared from the radar screen.</p> <p>Three months earlier, MoD documents record that a commercial pilot flying over the Midlands reported an unusual object travelling at 'very high speed' with a very bright strobe light flashing once every 20 seconds.</p> <p>Although the two incidents were unrelated, both were reported to a little-known department in the Ministry of Defence, known as Secretariat (Air Staff) 2a. This is the secretive section in Whitehall which collates reports of unidentified flying objects that cross British airspace.</p> <p>Whitehall has traditionally treated reports of UFO sightings as highly classified and only released information to the public after 30 years.

      "bodyText": "On 15 February 1999 an air traffic controller in Scotland noticed something strange on his radar screen. A bright blip on his screen suggested there was a very large object travelling at 3,000mph over the Scottish coastline heading south-west to Belfast. The size of the blip suggested the object was 10 miles long and two miles wide. Two minutes later the object disappeared from the radar screen. Three months earlier, MoD documents record that a commercial pilot flying over the Midlands reported an unusual object travelling at 'very high speed' with a very bright strobe light flashing once every 20 seconds. Although the two incidents were unrelated, both were reported to a little-known department in the Ministry of Defence, known as Secretariat (Air Staff) 2a. This is the secretive section in Whitehall which collates reports of unidentified flying objects that cross British airspace. Whitehall has traditionally treated reports of UFO sightings as highly classified and only released information to the public after 30 years. But the parliamentary Ombudsman insisted that the MoD hand this information to Colin Ridyard, a research chemist from Wales. Dr Ridyard had been seeking information relating to UFO sightings by pilots or radar operators between July 1998 and July 1999. Initially the MoD refused on the ground it would be too expensive.

Three other aircraft in the area reported seeing a ball of light moving at high speed. Air traffic controllers reported there were no strange aircraft in the area, but five minutes later an operator at a weather station picked up a fast-moving object on his radar.

Nothing was seen on the plane's radar or by air traffic controllers. The MoD told the Authority that there were no military aircraft known to be in that area at the time. Although an MoD spokeswoman would not discuss individual sightings, she said all these events had perfectly normal explanations. 'Some-times radars have spurious readings caused by military aircraft in the vicinity, and radar-jamming facilities and bright lights on the underside of aircraft can be caused by events on the ground.' In a letter to one of Ridyard's local MPs, Defence Minister John Spellar said: 'My department has no interest or role with respect to UFO/flying saucer matters or to the question of the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial life forms - about which we remain open-minded.' However, declassified gov ernment documents in the Public Records Office from June 1965 reveal that 'it was official MoD policy to play down the subject of unidentified flying objects and to avoid attaching undue public attention or publicity to the subject... as a result we have never had any political pressure to mount a large-scale investigation'.

The money will be used to buy permanent flagpoles on Garvaghy Road, one of the main arterial routes into Portadown town centre, and which Orangemen have been barred from marching along for two years. So far, however, only one American state has pledged to sponsor a tricolour and send its state flag - Arkansas, the home state of President Bill Clinton. The advertisement to sponsor a flag first appeared on the Republican Bulletin Board, a pro-Sinn Fein website. Noraid, the republican movement's support group in the US, has called on Irish-Americans to back the campaign, which is bound to infuriate Portadown's majority loyalist community. An Irish-American supporter of the Garvaghy Road community, Sherry O'Brien, pledged last week to bring flags to Portadown. David Jones, spokesman for the Portadown Orange Order, said nothing the nationalist residents' group did surprised him any more.

The North-West and North Antrim UDA brigades were also incensed that Gary McMichael, chief spokesman for the UDA-aligned Ulster Democratic Party, attended a cross-community service in a Garvaghy Road Roman Catholic church last week. One UDA source complained: 'Gary McMichael was able to walk on the Garvaghy Road, yet Orangemen from the town are barred from doing so.'",

The group was founded at the end of 1997 after a stormy Provisional IRA convention in Falcarragh, Co Donegal. McKevitt, then the Provos' quarter-master general in charge of its huge arsenal, argued that republicans should not sign up to the Mitchell principles on non-violence. Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams wanted the party to support the principles so it could remain in the all-party talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement. McKevitt, however, claimed that would mean signing away the IRA's historic right to wage war for a united Ireland. He and his supporters walked out, and later formed the new terrorist group. Earlier this year, The Observer revealed that the Real IRA's political allies, the 32 County Sovereignty Committee, had formed a London branch and held public meetings in Kilburn.",

'Good fences, good neighbours,' he shouted over the din of a generator, sounding more like American poet Robert Frost than a tough Israeli building contractor. In the Middle East, though, neighbours have never found it simple to draw a dividing line between them. Since the last Israeli troops and tanks rolled out of southern Lebanon on 24 May, defining the new frontier between the countries has become an exercise in geography and geopolitics. Using yellowed maps and satellite technology, United Nations cartographers have been redefining the colonial-era frontier that meanders from the Mediterranean coast to the foothills of the Golan Heights, slicing through stony hills, bisecting backyards, halving orchards, even dividing a village. UN verification of Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon, expected within days, hinges on agreement that the Israelis have fallen back to the internationally recognised 1923 border drawn by Britain, which administered the then-Palestine, and France, which ruled what are now Syria and Lebanon. As the modern map-makers went about defining the 50-mile frontier with splashes of paint and stone markers, conflicting claims have bubbled to the surface. Geographers say ambiguities stem from human beings leaving their mark on the landscape: building roads, changing the direction of watersheds, filling in river beds and eradicating other landmarks.

Some diggers were furtively gathering handfuls of earth in plastic bags. 'Take some home with you,' Emma Popova, a local teaching assistant, said. 'This is holy soil. When the church is built, this place will become our Jerusalem. People will travel from all over the world to pray here.'</p> <p>Most of the volunteers were elderly Yekaterinburg residents, people who learnt at school that Nicholas II was a cruel oppressor, and that the Orthodox faith was harm ful nonsense. Shifting perspectives on Russia's history over the past decade have left many of them with a strange sense of guilt.</p> <p>'Ours is the most sinful generation. For most of our lives we didn't know what religion was and we didn't pray,' said Lydia Shaladineva, 62, a retired farmer. 'It's only recently that we've found out the importance of religion and that Tsar Nicholas was a good, kind man. We need to have a church here so we can ask forgiveness for our indifference to his death.'</p> <p>In this confused rush to reassess the past, Nicholas's faults - his anti-Semitism, his ineffectual hold on power - have been blithely forgotten. 'Nicholas was a good man because he did so much for the Orthodox Church. It would be lovely to have another tsar like him,' another volunteer, Valentina Devichova, 61, said as she rested after almost an hour of digging. 'But then, Stalin wasn't such a bad man either.' Father Alexander, the priest overseeing the project, waved incense over the ruins and said prayers as the digging continued. Before the revolution, Yekaterinburg had been blessed with more than 30 churches, he said, but by the late Eighties only one remained in service. Over the past decade, the local patriarchy restored 11, but the town was still short of places to pray.</p> <p>Many of the diggers had come in search of Romanov memorabilia. But their hopes of finding trinkets dropped carelessly in the grounds were unlikely to be realised; most of the time the family was locked up inside. Nicholas whiled away the hours playing dominoes with his children and reading War and Peace .</p> <p>Around 2am on 17 July 1918, the tsar and his family were woken by their guards and led down to the cellar. A few minutes later, six executioners were brought in by a local Bolshevik apparatchik and ordered to fire. Some accounts attest that the princesses were protected from the explosion of bullets by jewels sewn into their underclothes. Their assassins are said to have been forced to finish the job with bayonets.</p> <p>Even the younger of the two on-site priests, Father Yury, 22, was excited by the morbid possibilities of the excavation. 'It would be nice if we found a bit of wall from the cellar with a bullet in it. Of course, it would be a miracle if we did, but miracles like this happen. It's all in the hands of God,' he said. By the end of the week an old cartridge had been unearthed, but local archaeologists were not convinced it was connected with the execution. The skeletons of a woman and a small child were also dug up, but volunteers learnt that the bodies dated back a century before the Romanovs were killed.</p> <p>The remains of all the family, except Prince Alexei and Princess Maria ,were found by archaeologists in 1991 and buried by the Bolsheviks in the woods outside Yekaterinburg. The search for remnants of the missing two is to be launched again soon.</p> <p>But a large pile of bricks and stone fragments from the walls of the cellar has been gathered and will be used in construction of the church. Architects have included an accurate recreation of the underground room in their designs. 'This will be a very holy place for prayer,' Grigory Mazaev, the supervising architect, said. The five-cupola building will stand 56 metres high and has been designed in a Russo-Byzantine style typical of late-nineteenth-century churches - updated to include two lifts and underfloor heating. 'It was the style Nicholas favoured himself,' Mazaev said.</p> <p>Over the past decade the Romanov church project has been cursed with scandal and conflict. In the early Nineties a local priest collected a considerable amount of money to pay for it. Later both the priest and the money disappeared. The project was resurrected in the mid-Nineties, and an architect was commissioned to draw up the plans. But a row broke out with the local administration and he withdrew his design. This time Mazaev is confident that the bulk of the new project will be completed by 2002.</p> <p>However, the question of funding continues to cause trouble. No state money is forthcoming, so the bulk will come from private donations and sponsors. And the extravagance of the project has shocked many, particularly given the manifold social problems troubling Yekaterinburg, where crime and drug addiction are rife.</p> <p>None of the volunteers seemed unduly concerned by the expense. 'The young people in this town are crippled by problems - unemployment, drug abuse, crime - but that's precisely why we need a church here,' one woman said.</p> <p>Shaladineva, who receives a monthly pension of 706 roubles (\u00a316) a month, agreed that the \u00a35m price tag was irrelevant. 'Before I started going to church, I was always short of money. But then I started praying and God began to help me. Last month my pension went up by 50 per cent,' she said.</p>",

When the church is built, this place will become our Jerusalem. People will travel from all over the world to pray here.' Most of the volunteers were elderly Yekaterinburg residents, people who learnt at school that Nicholas II was a cruel oppressor, and that the Orthodox faith was harm ful nonsense. Shifting perspectives on Russia's history over the past decade have left many of them with a strange sense of guilt. 'Ours is the most sinful generation. For most of our lives we didn't know what religion was and we didn't pray,' said Lydia Shaladineva, 62, a retired farmer. 'It's only recently that we've found out the importance of religion and that Tsar Nicholas was a good, kind man. We need to have a church here so we can ask forgiveness for our indifference to his death.' In this confused rush to reassess the past, Nicholas's faults - his anti-Semitism, his ineffectual hold on power - have been blithely forgotten. 'Nicholas was a good man because he did so much for the Orthodox Church. It would be lovely to have another tsar like him,' another volunteer, Valentina Devichova, 61, said as she rested after almost an hour of digging. 'But then, Stalin wasn't such a bad man either.' Father Alexander, the priest overseeing the project, waved incense over the ruins and said prayers as the digging continued. Before the revolution, Yekaterinburg had been blessed with more than 30 churches, he said, but by the late Eighties only one remained in service. Over the past decade, the local patriarchy restored 11, but the town was still short of places to pray. Many of the diggers had come in search of Romanov memorabilia. But their hopes of finding trinkets dropped carelessly in the grounds were unlikely to be realised; most of the time the family was locked up inside. Nicholas whiled away the hours playing dominoes with his children and reading War and Peace . Around 2am on 17 July 1918, the tsar and his family were woken by their guards and led down to the cellar. A few minutes later, six executioners were brought in by a local Bolshevik apparatchik and ordered to fire. Some accounts attest that the princesses were protected from the explosion of bullets by jewels sewn into their underclothes. Their assassins are said to have been forced to finish the job with bayonets. Even the younger of the two on-site priests, Father Yury, 22, was excited by the morbid possibilities of the excavation. 'It would be nice if we found a bit of wall from the cellar with a bullet in it. Of course, it would be a miracle if we did, but miracles like this happen. It's all in the hands of God,' he said. By the end of the week an old cartridge had been unearthed, but local archaeologists were not convinced it was connected with the execution. The skeletons of a woman and a small child were also dug up, but volunteers learnt that the bodies dated back a century before the Romanovs were killed. The remains of all the family, except Prince Alexei and Princess Maria ,were found by archaeologists in 1991 and buried by the Bolsheviks in the woods outside Yekaterinburg. The search for remnants of the missing two is to be launched again soon. But a large pile of bricks and stone fragments from the walls of the cellar has been gathered and will be used in construction of the church. Architects have included an accurate recreation of the underground room in their designs. 'This will be a very holy place for prayer,' Grigory Mazaev, the supervising architect, said. The five-cupola building will stand 56 metres high and has been designed in a Russo-Byzantine style typical of late-nineteenth-century churches - updated to include two lifts and underfloor heating. 'It was the style Nicholas favoured himself,' Mazaev said. Over the past decade the Romanov church project has been cursed with scandal and conflict. In the early Nineties a local priest collected a considerable amount of money to pay for it. Later both the priest and the money disappeared. The project was resurrected in the mid-Nineties, and an architect was commissioned to draw up the plans. But a row broke out with the local administration and he withdrew his design. This time Mazaev is confident that the bulk of the new project will be completed by 2002. However, the question of funding continues to cause trouble. No state money is forthcoming, so the bulk will come from private donations and sponsors. And the extravagance of the project has shocked many, particularly given the manifold social problems troubling Yekaterinburg, where crime and drug addiction are rife. None of the volunteers seemed unduly concerned by the expense. 'The young people in this town are crippled by problems - unemployment, drug abuse, crime - but that's precisely why we need a church here,' one woman said. Shaladineva, who receives a monthly pension of 706 roubles (\u00a316) a month, agreed that the \u00a35m price tag was irrelevant. 'Before I started going to church, I was always short of money. But then I started praying and God began to help me. Last month my pension went up by 50 per cent,' she said.",

      "body": "<p>Vlastimir Miric and Sinisa Dimic were travelling a 'safe' road. But in the Crescent, a semi-circle of Serbian villages around Pristina, nothing is certain for the Serbs who have chosen to stay.</p> <p>The men were driving on a road created by British soldiers of K-For, the Kosovo protection force, which should have allowed them travel between their villages unmolested by ethnic Albanians. What should have been the most secure area in the province is patrolled by helicopters and armoured cars.</p> <p>But it was not enough to stop the killers. Some time on Thursday night an anti-vehicle mine was laid by the British road. As the Serbs drove to market it exploded, the blast ripping through the front of their car. Miric, 41, and Dimic, 38, were killed outright. The Nalasa family riding in the back were badly injured. Ristic is 31. Her daughters, Krostna and Bojana, are five and two.</p> <p>Yesterday, as their families mourned, the British Army opened another new road in the Crescent, built under the auspices of Operation Trojan, whose aim is to improve protection and conditions for the Serbs. The timing has not been lost on the Serbs or senior British officers, few of whom doubt the enormity of the task that now faces them in trying to protect the Serbian population. 'We are doing our best,' said one. 'But the truth is, if people are determined, we cannot stop them murdering each other.'</p> <p>It is a sentiment that resonates with the entire international presence in the region. For as K-For and the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) prepare to mark next week's first anniversary of their presence in the former south Serbian province, it has been plunged into a sense of crisis by a series of brutal attacks on Serb civilians. These are designed, senior officials believe, to put pressure on Kosovo's remaining 95,000 Serbs to leave for good.</p> <p>Few are in any doubt about the significance attached to the time chosen for the killings, which are intended to capitalise on the expected disappointment and alarm of Kosovo Serbs who had been led to believe by Belgrade propaganda over the last 12 months that Serbian police and soldiers would return to the province in the next few weeks.</p> <p>The latest spate of murders began last Sunday evening, when two adults and a four-year-old child were killed in a drive-by killing in the village of Cernica in the so-called Iron Triangle of villages in the south-east of Kosovo. On Wednesday a shooting in the village of Babin Most killed one and injured another.</p> <p>On Thursday it was the turn of the Serbs of Klokot, when gunmen attacked on a quiet country road, killing a woman and injuring her two male companions.</p> <p>The murders - which followed a weekend of fighting in villages along the southern border with Serbia - were committed by members of the Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac (UCPMB), which is seeking to reclaim three towns in so-called 'Eastern Kosovo', which remains in Serbia proper. They have highlighted a growing sense within the international community in Kosovo that its mission is in danger of losing its way.</p> <p>More serious still for their morale is the suspicion that, now the Kosovars have got the upper hand, extremists within their community have rediscovered their determination to cleanse Kosovo of its last Serbs as thoroughly as Slobodan Milosevic tried to cleanse it of Albanians only a year ago.</p> <p>A year into its mission the UN and K-For have been forced to accept that the remaining Serbs cannot live within the majority ethnic Albanian community without round-the-clock protection. The few hundred that remain in Pristina are guarded 24 hours a day by soldiers of the British brigade. Most are too afraid to venture out to work. The remainder - the vast majority - live either in the north among Serbian communities sustained by contact with Serbia proper to the north, or in fortified hamlets, villages and ghettoes, unable to move except in heavily protected buses. The latest killings simply underline what many within the UN mission now believe - that the much-vaunted policy of preserving a multi-ethnic Kosovo, as set out in Security Council Resolution 1244, has failed. Instead K-For and its soldiers are being forced into cantonisation, locking the Serbs within high-security pockets.</p> <p>'You've got to be realistic,' said one K-For officer last week. 'These people are not going to live together. Officially the policy is for a multi-ethnic society. Unofficially we would just be happy if they could live side by side without murdering each other.' Another officer was more direct. 'We are just holding the line. We are simply marking time until the international community decides whether Kosovo deserves to have independent status.'</p> <p>It is likely to be a long wait. For the issue of Kosovo's final status - as an independent nation on the same model as Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia - is the question haunting the anniversary of Nato's first military engagement in 50 years. For while Nato and its allies won the war, the question is whether the international community is winning - or can win - the peace on terms that it does not find repellent.</p> <p>And in the current crisis of confidence it is Kosovo's vague legal status (within a wider federal Yugoslavia but outside President Milosevic's control) that has become Kosovo's Catch-22. More properly its has become Catch-1244 for the Security Council resolution that keeps it in a state of legal limbo while in all other respects it creeps towards a de facto independence.</p> <p>Its borders - in theory policed by Yugoslav police - are controlled by the UN. And for the majority of ethnic Albanians, its independence has already happened, if not by referendum then by popular assent. The only stumbling block is the continuing presence of the Serbs, whose own claim - recognised under Resolution 1244 - is the brake on Kosovar ambitions.</p> <p>The conviction that Kosovo's independence is an imminent and legal formality is not shared by Kosovo's UN administrator, Bernard Kouchner.

      "bodyText": "Vlastimir Miric and Sinisa Dimic were travelling a 'safe' road. But in the Crescent, a semi-circle of Serbian villages around Pristina, nothing is certain for the Serbs who have chosen to stay. The men were driving on a road created by British soldiers of K-For, the Kosovo protection force, which should have allowed them travel between their villages unmolested by ethnic Albanians. What should have been the most secure area in the province is patrolled by helicopters and armoured cars. But it was not enough to stop the killers. Some time on Thursday night an anti-vehicle mine was laid by the British road. As the Serbs drove to market it exploded, the blast ripping through the front of their car. Miric, 41, and Dimic, 38, were killed outright. The Nalasa family riding in the back were badly injured. Ristic is 31. Her daughters, Krostna and Bojana, are five and two. Yesterday, as their families mourned, the British Army opened another new road in the Crescent, built under the auspices of Operation Trojan, whose aim is to improve protection and conditions for the Serbs. The timing has not been lost on the Serbs or senior British officers, few of whom doubt the enormity of the task that now faces them in trying to protect the Serbian population. 'We are doing our best,' said one. 'But the truth is, if people are determined, we cannot stop them murdering each other.' It is a sentiment that resonates with the entire international presence in the region. For as K-For and the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) prepare to mark next week's first anniversary of their presence in the former south Serbian province, it has been plunged into a sense of crisis by a series of brutal attacks on Serb civilians. These are designed, senior officials believe, to put pressure on Kosovo's remaining 95,000 Serbs to leave for good. Few are in any doubt about the significance attached to the time chosen for the killings, which are intended to capitalise on the expected disappointment and alarm of Kosovo Serbs who had been led to believe by Belgrade propaganda over the last 12 months that Serbian police and soldiers would return to the province in the next few weeks. The latest spate of murders began last Sunday evening, when two adults and a four-year-old child were killed in a drive-by killing in the village of Cernica in the so-called Iron Triangle of villages in the south-east of Kosovo. On Wednesday a shooting in the village of Babin Most killed one and injured another. On Thursday it was the turn of the Serbs of Klokot, when gunmen attacked on a quiet country road, killing a woman and injuring her two male companions. The murders - which followed a weekend of fighting in villages along the southern border with Serbia - were committed by members of the Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac (UCPMB), which is seeking to reclaim three towns in so-called 'Eastern Kosovo', which remains in Serbia proper. They have highlighted a growing sense within the international community in Kosovo that its mission is in danger of losing its way. More serious still for their morale is the suspicion that, now the Kosovars have got the upper hand, extremists within their community have rediscovered their determination to cleanse Kosovo of its last Serbs as thoroughly as Slobodan Milosevic tried to cleanse it of Albanians only a year ago. A year into its mission the UN and K-For have been forced to accept that the remaining Serbs cannot live within the majority ethnic Albanian community without round-the-clock protection. The few hundred that remain in Pristina are guarded 24 hours a day by soldiers of the British brigade. Most are too afraid to venture out to work. The remainder - the vast majority - live either in the north among Serbian communities sustained by contact with Serbia proper to the north, or in fortified hamlets, villages and ghettoes, unable to move except in heavily protected buses. The latest killings simply underline what many within the UN mission now believe - that the much-vaunted policy of preserving a multi-ethnic Kosovo, as set out in Security Council Resolution 1244, has failed. Instead K-For and its soldiers are being forced into cantonisation, locking the Serbs within high-security pockets. 'You've got to be realistic,' said one K-For officer last week. 'These people are not going to live together. Officially the policy is for a multi-ethnic society. Unofficially we would just be happy if they could live side by side without murdering each other.' Another officer was more direct. 'We are just holding the line. We are simply marking time until the international community decides whether Kosovo deserves to have independent status.' It is likely to be a long wait. For the issue of Kosovo's final status - as an independent nation on the same model as Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia - is the question haunting the anniversary of Nato's first military engagement in 50 years. For while Nato and its allies won the war, the question is whether the international community is winning - or can win - the peace on terms that it does not find repellent. And in the current crisis of confidence it is Kosovo's vague legal status (within a wider federal Yugoslavia but outside President Milosevic's control) that has become Kosovo's Catch-22. More properly its has become Catch-1244 for the Security Council resolution that keeps it in a state of legal limbo while in all other respects it creeps towards a de facto independence. Its borders - in theory policed by Yugoslav police - are controlled by the UN. And for the majority of ethnic Albanians, its independence has already happened, if not by referendum then by popular assent. The only stumbling block is the continuing presence of the Serbs, whose own claim - recognised under Resolution 1244 - is the brake on Kosovar ambitions. The conviction that Kosovo's independence is an imminent and legal formality is not shared by Kosovo's UN administrator, Bernard Kouchner. 'I know the wish of the majority of Kosovars is for independence, but it is not my problem,' he said recently in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia. Instead, Kouchner and Daan Everts, head of the mission for the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, will propose to the Security Council later this month that any decision on Kosovo's final status is deferred for up to five years. Instead of independence, Kosovars will be offered a 'contract with Kosovo' which would provide guaranteed security of their borders from Serb attack and international aid in exchange for political development and putting their claims to independence on hold. 'I think there are enough reasonable people here. They realise they are reliant on us. They are beggars. They are not choosers,' said Everts last week. 'They know that, without the protection of the international community, they would be overrun by the Serbs within one day.' But even the most moderate ethnic Albanians have grown increasingly frustrated with the international community, a view reflected by Albanian students last week. 'This is our country now,' said Vlora, aged 19, as she watched a parade on Children's Day. 'The sooner the UN realises that and lets us get on and run our lives the better. We must be allowed to run our own affairs.' It is a frustration felt on both sides. Many in the UN mission are disillusioned by the continuing attacks on Serbs, by criminality, allegations of murder and corruption within the ethnic Albanian political \u00e9lite and by the sense that the mission in Kosovo has completely lost its way. 'The truth about what is really going on here is being suppressed,' says a senior international officer in the UN police force. 'There are incidents going on all the time that are simply not publicised. There is a deliberate denial of what is really going on. The honeymoon period that greeted our arrival is over.

'No time like the present,' says my wife, ruling out the past for obvious reasons, and mindful that the future (as measured from now until Saturday) will be short of trained supervisory staff to stand over me until it gets done. 'It won't take long,' she says. Wrong. I haul the mattress off to reveal not only possibly the last remaining parallelogram-shaped bed in Hertfordshire but an unusual shortfall in the number of bits holding it together, which now explains how the removal men managed to put it together so quickly when we moved in last summer. 'It needs some screws,' I say. 'I'll just nip out to Do-It-All. I won't take long...' No way. Suddenly they're running late and absolutely MUST get to the McDonald's at Newport Pagnall or somewhere by lunch, which means I'm left with the brown Metro with the dodgy brakes we borrowed from her mother, which admittedly is fine for getting my wife to work but she's surely not expecting me to drive it? 'Well, I suppose you could walk,' she says. 'You'll be back this time tomorrow!' How hilarious. There's a cooked chicken in the fridge, she adds as she drives off, the children blowing kisses and making faces in the back, as though I'm incapable of opening a tin of soup. This should be the point where I lie down on the sofa and enjoy the novelty of being able to hear myself sniff (I have a cold) without being told to find a tissue if I wouldn't mind, but instead I'm obliged to drive the rattletrap up to Do-It-All and back, and spend the rest of the afternoon discovering how difficult it is to think up enough swearwords to make a bed rectangular using no method more technically orthodox than banging your fingers with a hammer. At last I've finished, but by now the damned thing's got so much metal in it I need a forklift truck to get it back against the wall. Come seven o'clock, the thrill of being left to my own supposedly leisure-oriented devices has worn off, so I walk eight miles up to the village and park myself in a pub, where I soon come to the attention of the locals by provocatively reading a book outside library opening hours. But before anyone gets the chance to call the police, the bloody quiz starts up and the place is jam-packed full of people chewing Biros and conferring over the likely weight of the common shrew. This isn't the best time to leave my spot and go off to the toilets to look at stupid prints of dogs playing snooker and a sign on the hand drier saying 'Wash your hands' - I mean, like you'd be drying your hands if you hadn't yet worked out how to get them wet - and sure enough by the time I get back I have been crowded out into the fireplace by an overweight, frowning couple in matching Camra sweatshirts with a loudspeaker in my ear. 'Question FOUR,' the quizmaster is booming. 'What material were George Washington's false teeth made of?' Actually, I do know this one, but I'm afraid I wouldn't lean across the table to offer the hand of friendship with a confident if unsolicited ejaculation of the word 'wood' if they paid me. After hours of this, someone wins \u00a35 and I stagger out with six pints of Guinness inside me and try to find my way home down the hill and up the lane in the pitch black now that summer's here and all the trees have grown leaves. Naturally I have neglected to leave a light on, though this is not an issue because I have now strayed from the path and begun stumbling through the woods, which strictly speaking only counts as a short cut if you live in the next county. But at last I'm standing in the kitchen devouring a chicken whole without using a plate and drinking milk from the carton before clomping up to bed as loud as I want. Now for a decent night's...

After hours of this, someone wins \u00a35 and I stagger out with six pints of Guinness inside me and try to find my way home down the hill and up the lane in the pitch black now that summer's here and all the trees have grown leaves. Naturally I have neglected to leave a light on, though this is not an issue because I have now strayed from the path and begun stumbling through the woods, which strictly speaking only counts as a short cut if you live in the next county. But at last I'm standing in the kitchen devouring a chicken whole without using a plate and drinking milk from the carton before clomping up to bed as loud as I want. Now for a decent night's...

In support, they will cite the celebrated libel case in which a British academic complained to Demon Internet about some defamatory material contained in Usenet postings which were relayed by Demon (and thousands of ISPs throughout the world). Demon failed to respond to his complaint, and on 26 March last year Mr Justice Morland ruled in the High Court that the company was liable for the content of a Usenet discussion group.

The last time there was a threat to the system was in the summer of 1998.

      "body": "<p>The cold, hard fact about Birmingham International Airport is that more people from the region travel to Manchester and London to catch their planes than to their local airport. </p> <p>This is a situation that airport managing director Brian Summers and his team want to remedy over the next decade. The airport is growing rapidly and doubled its traffic during the Nineties to seven million passengers a year, with particularly buoyant development in the last three years. But it has always been a source of frustration that the airport serving Britain's second city and its vital industrial region is not 'self-sufficient' when it comes to providing air services for the local population. </p> <p>Passenger traffic from Birmingham's airport could easily double in the next decade without the need for extra runways or terminals. Almost half these passengers come directly from the West Midlands region, many from the East Midlands and the rest from an area stretching from the Severn to the Wash. Summers estimates that the airport serves half the business travel needs of the 15 million people living within a two-hour drive of the airport, but only 37 per cent of the demand for holiday flights. He said: 'At the moment, more people in our regional market go elsewhere for their air services than come to us.' </p> <p>The dream is to build up services, both scheduled and charter, over the coming years so that the airport satisfies more and more of local people's travel needs. </p> <p>Many airlines have been reluctant to fly routes from Birmingham, either because they felt they could not make money or simply that flying from Manchester, Heathrow and Gatwick is so lucrative and popular they decided it obviated the need to serve Brum. </p> <p>But Summers said this is changing. The UK air travel market is growing at around 6 per cent a year, people want to fly from their local airport and the Birmingham team constantly lobbies airlines, using route and market analysis showing which new services might be viable. </p> <p>'People used to think we do not need to fly from Birmingham because it is all about services from London. But now people are increasingly saying Birmingham is here in its own right and we need to have good air service links; we know there are good services from Manchester and London, but we want them here in our own region.' </p> <p>Birmingham had an air link to Heathrow until 1993 when the airline operating it, British Midland, pulled out. </p> <p>The move was seen as a blow at the time, but Summers said that, with hindsight, it helped Birmingham to become stronger as an independent airport. </p> <p>'In many ways our history is almost blighted by our proximity to London, but in the last 10 years we have turned around that situation. Since flights to Heathrow finished it has helped us become more self-sufficient, developing our own routes and becoming more accessible - being used as an entry point into the global system rather than just a feeder airport,' he said. </p> <p>Birmingham International Airport now has two non-stop, daily scheduled services to the United States: American Airlines to its hub at Chicago, and Continental Airlines flying into New York's Newark airport. </p> <p>Up to three-quarters of the passengers using these services are not going to Chicago or New York but are connecting there for other US destinations, or even flights to Central and South America and Canada. Toronto is coming on stream this summer. New services to Pakistan began in April and the flights to Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi, operated by Pakistan International Airlines, have proved a significant boost to the airport's international standing. </p> <p>The flowering of international airline alliances and growth of 'hub' airports on the Continent are both developments in the airline industry that have benefited Birmingham and made the region less reliant on London for its air services in recent years. </p> <p>Airlines, the airports, business travel agents in the area and passengers themselves are increasingly waking up to the fact that long-haul connections are often better made by flying from Birmingham to somewhere such as Amsterdam or Paris, then transferring - rather than trekking to Heathrow. </p> <p>Travellers heading from Birmingham to Australia, for example, now often prefer to fly with British Airways to Frankfurt and transfer onto BA's partner airline, Qantas, for its service to Sydney, rather than driving or taking the train to London. Similarly, a Sabena flight from Birmingham to Brussels gives passengers a 50-minute connection to Johannesburg. </p> <p>Summers said: 'There is no reason for Midlands travellers to go to Manchester for European scheduled services, because we have got virtually the same network. It has grown up around British Airways, but now other European carriers, such as Lufthansa, KLM and Air France are building up their connections. </p> <p>'With airline alliances and international connections over various hub airports on the Continent becoming more sophisticated, Birming ham is now just another entry point into the global system. Increasingly, you plug into the world network from your local airport, and we want to build on this trend.' </p> <p>Birmingham has missed some transatlantic opportunities, however, because of the restricted air agreement between the UK and US. </p> <p>The rules about which airlines could fly where across the Atlantic were relaxed partially in 1994 and this sparked the initial development of scheduled flights to the US. </p> <p>But the failure thus far of the UK and US to agree a deal to open up Heathrow to greater transatlantic competition has had a knock-on effect on all regional airports, including Birmingham. </p> <p>Because airlines, principally from the US but also companies such as British Midland, are focusing their fight on winning transatlantic access to Heathrow, they refuse to launch services from places like Birmingham in case it undermines their efforts to expand in London. </p> <p>It is felt that at least one or two other US routes would have been started out of Birmingham over the last five years if the Heathrow question had been resolved. </p> <p>There is now growing expectation that the UK and US will pull off a new air transport accord this summer - their last chance to do so before the Clinton administration battens down for the November election and all other major issues are sidelined. </p> <p> It may not be a full-blown removal of restrictions between Heathrow and the US for all carriers, but a further partial opening up of the London hub will be a major development. </p> <p>If more airlines achieve their target of flying transatlantic from Heathrow, then airports such as Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow hope the companies will then turn their attention to potentially lucrative new US routes from the regions. But Summers warned: 'We have been held back by the transatlantic impasse. But, conversely for us, it might take some time for us to get over the opening up of Heathrow if there is a new bilateral deal. </p> <p>'The US carriers will want to pour into Heathrow and there will be a massive competitive market situation. It could be a bloodbath and the regions will suffer collectively in this sort of arena. But eventually it will settle down and we might have to wait for that before we see benefits.' Summers added that he supported the adoption of an 'open position' across the Atlantic, but insisted that the UK must get a fair deal for its airlines. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Birmingham is busy with its steady expansion programme. </p> <p>It is in year four of a 10-year, \u00a3260 million spending programme to modernise its facilities and increase capacity at the airport. It is already the third largest airport in the UK for charter traffic, although only 38 per cent of the annual 7 million passengers are flying charter on package holidays, with 62 per cent using scheduled airlines. </p> <p>The current investment programme was launched in 1997 after the airport's ownership structure changed, in line with government policy, from an entirely public-sector organisation into a public-private partnership. It is now owned 49 per cent by the seven West Midlands local authorities and 40 per cent by Irish airport business Aer Rianta, with small percentages held by National Car Parks, John Laing and an employee share trust. The airport employs 5,300 staff directly on site and this is forecast to increase to 12,300 by 2011. </p> <p>It is all a long way from the humble beginnings of the then Elmdon airstrip planned by Birmingham City Council in 1928 on a site eight miles south-east of the city. Its development was put on hold by the Depression. </p> <p>No sooner had the airport opened in 1939 than it was requisitioned for military purposes and Stirling and Lancaster bombers were sent from local factories, via Elmdon, to the RAF in the Second World War. </p> <p>Commercial scheduled services resumed in 1949 and now 160 services depart from the international airport daily. Summers said: 'We are a vital part of the infrastructure for the whole region.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "The cold, hard fact about Birmingham International Airport is that more people from the region travel to Manchester and London to catch their planes than to their local airport. This is a situation that airport managing director Brian Summers and his team want to remedy over the next decade. The airport is growing rapidly and doubled its traffic during the Nineties to seven million passengers a year, with particularly buoyant development in the last three years. But it has always been a source of frustration that the airport serving Britain's second city and its vital industrial region is not 'self-sufficient' when it comes to providing air services for the local population. Passenger traffic from Birmingham's airport could easily double in the next decade without the need for extra runways or terminals. Almost half these passengers come directly from the West Midlands region, many from the East Midlands and the rest from an area stretching from the Severn to the Wash. Summers estimates that the airport serves half the business travel needs of the 15 million people living within a two-hour drive of the airport, but only 37 per cent of the demand for holiday flights. He said: 'At the moment, more people in our regional market go elsewhere for their air services than come to us.' The dream is to build up services, both scheduled and charter, over the coming years so that the airport satisfies more and more of local people's travel needs. Many airlines have been reluctant to fly routes from Birmingham, either because they felt they could not make money or simply that flying from Manchester, Heathrow and Gatwick is so lucrative and popular they decided it obviated the need to serve Brum. But Summers said this is changing. The UK air travel market is growing at around 6 per cent a year, people want to fly from their local airport and the Birmingham team constantly lobbies airlines, using route and market analysis showing which new services might be viable. 'People used to think we do not need to fly from Birmingham because it is all about services from London. But now people are increasingly saying Birmingham is here in its own right and we need to have good air service links; we know there are good services from Manchester and London, but we want them here in our own region.' Birmingham had an air link to Heathrow until 1993 when the airline operating it, British Midland, pulled out. The move was seen as a blow at the time, but Summers said that, with hindsight, it helped Birmingham to become stronger as an independent airport. 'In many ways our history is almost blighted by our proximity to London, but in the last 10 years we have turned around that situation. Since flights to Heathrow finished it has helped us become more self-sufficient, developing our own routes and becoming more accessible - being used as an entry point into the global system rather than just a feeder airport,' he said. Birmingham International Airport now has two non-stop, daily scheduled services to the United States: American Airlines to its hub at Chicago, and Continental Airlines flying into New York's Newark airport. Up to three-quarters of the passengers using these services are not going to Chicago or New York but are connecting there for other US destinations, or even flights to Central and South America and Canada. Toronto is coming on stream this summer. New services to Pakistan began in April and the flights to Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi, operated by Pakistan International Airlines, have proved a significant boost to the airport's international standing. The flowering of international airline alliances and growth of 'hub' airports on the Continent are both developments in the airline industry that have benefited Birmingham and made the region less reliant on London for its air services in recent years. Airlines, the airports, business travel agents in the area and passengers themselves are increasingly waking up to the fact that long-haul connections are often better made by flying from Birmingham to somewhere such as Amsterdam or Paris, then transferring - rather than trekking to Heathrow. Travellers heading from Birmingham to Australia, for example, now often prefer to fly with British Airways to Frankfurt and transfer onto BA's partner airline, Qantas, for its service to Sydney, rather than driving or taking the train to London. Similarly, a Sabena flight from Birmingham to Brussels gives passengers a 50-minute connection to Johannesburg. Summers said: 'There is no reason for Midlands travellers to go to Manchester for European scheduled services, because we have got virtually the same network. It has grown up around British Airways, but now other European carriers, such as Lufthansa, KLM and Air France are building up their connections. 'With airline alliances and international connections over various hub airports on the Continent becoming more sophisticated, Birming ham is now just another entry point into the global system. Increasingly, you plug into the world network from your local airport, and we want to build on this trend.' Birmingham has missed some transatlantic opportunities, however, because of the restricted air agreement between the UK and US. The rules about which airlines could fly where across the Atlantic were relaxed partially in 1994 and this sparked the initial development of scheduled flights to the US. But the failure thus far of the UK and US to agree a deal to open up Heathrow to greater transatlantic competition has had a knock-on effect on all regional airports, including Birmingham. Because airlines, principally from the US but also companies such as British Midland, are focusing their fight on winning transatlantic access to Heathrow, they refuse to launch services from places like Birmingham in case it undermines their efforts to expand in London. It is felt that at least one or two other US routes would have been started out of Birmingham over the last five years if the Heathrow question had been resolved. There is now growing expectation that the UK and US will pull off a new air transport accord this summer - their last chance to do so before the Clinton administration battens down for the November election and all other major issues are sidelined. It may not be a full-blown removal of restrictions between Heathrow and the US for all carriers, but a further partial opening up of the London hub will be a major development. If more airlines achieve their target of flying transatlantic from Heathrow, then airports such as Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow hope the companies will then turn their attention to potentially lucrative new US routes from the regions. But Summers warned: 'We have been held back by the transatlantic impasse. But, conversely for us, it might take some time for us to get over the opening up of Heathrow if there is a new bilateral deal. 'The US carriers will want to pour into Heathrow and there will be a massive competitive market situation. It could be a bloodbath and the regions will suffer collectively in this sort of arena. But eventually it will settle down and we might have to wait for that before we see benefits.' Summers added that he supported the adoption of an 'open position' across the Atlantic, but insisted that the UK must get a fair deal for its airlines. Meanwhile, Birmingham is busy with its steady expansion programme. It is in year four of a 10-year, \u00a3260 million spending programme to modernise its facilities and increase capacity at the airport. It is already the third largest airport in the UK for charter traffic, although only 38 per cent of the annual 7 million passengers are flying charter on package holidays, with 62 per cent using scheduled airlines. The current investment programme was launched in 1997 after the airport's ownership structure changed, in line with government policy, from an entirely public-sector organisation into a public-private partnership. It is now owned 49 per cent by the seven West Midlands local authorities and 40 per cent by Irish airport business Aer Rianta, with small percentages held by National Car Parks, John Laing and an employee share trust. The airport employs 5,300 staff directly on site and this is forecast to increase to 12,300 by 2011. It is all a long way from the humble beginnings of the then Elmdon airstrip planned by Birmingham City Council in 1928 on a site eight miles south-east of the city. Its development was put on hold by the Depression. No sooner had the airport opened in 1939 than it was requisitioned for military purposes and Stirling and Lancaster bombers were sent from local factories, via Elmdon, to the RAF in the Second World War. Commercial scheduled services resumed in 1949 and now 160 services depart from the international airport daily. Summers said: 'We are a vital part of the infrastructure for the whole region.'",

Cluttering every inch of wall space are the trophies of 40 years at the peak of the world's global media industry. But what's so chilling about these mementos is how far and how fast Turner is slipping from his glory days. </p> <p>On Turner's capacious desk is a motto: 'If you can't lead, follow or get out of the way.' And Turner is getting out of the way, or at least being elbowed aside by a gaggle of men in suits - the men from AOL and Time Warner, to which Turner sold his cable broadcasting empire just four years ago. </p> <p>Braving out the latest restructuring which sees Turner lose executive control of his broadcast networks he yells: 'When companies merge, people always get laid off, right. What's the big deal about that? And the merger hasn't gone through yet. So I've got my pink slip, right. But something could happen to the merger. My favourite song - I was listening to it today - is 'One Day At a Time, Sweet Jesus' . Just take one day at a time; there may not be a next week anyway, the way things are; it's very uncertain.' </p> <p>Exactly what is uncertain is left unspoken. But in what is being described by CNN insiders as a bloodless coup, Turner is being demoted in favour of AOL executives as the online service provider merges with Time Warner. News of the management restructuring - set to be operational once the $143 billion merger is finalised in the autumn - emerged this week at CNN's World Report, an annual event that brings politicians and CNN heavyweights together for a week-long conference. </p> <p>The detail of the new management was given in a press release four weeks ago. But the news that Turner's only title once the merger is completed will be 'special advisor and vice-chairman'- a non-executive role he shares with at least one other suit - only appeared in the Los Angeles Times a few days before. </p> <p>Gerald Levin, chief executive of AOL Time Warner, is frank. 'It's my responsibility to put in place a structure that maximises the tremendous talent that we have - most particularly in the case of Ted. What we're attempting to do, and Ted fully understands this, is to take his capability and give him a broader platform so that he can provide the kind of wisdom that's necessary in our company.' </p> <p>But here's the rub - and it comes from AOL Time Warner chairman Steve Case. 'He will play a bigger role on the overall strategy of the company. He was surprised by the speed of the decision. Gerry came and said here's a structure and suddenly a week or so later we announced and I think he was surprised by the pace of that. But he asked to play a broader role and that's the role he's going to play.' </p> <p>What Turner is left with is a whole lot of anecdotes. About how Fidel Castro gave him the idea for launching CNN International (the dictator was watching a pirated version of the American channel in Communist Cuba at the time); about how the start of the Gulf War in 1991 was 'unquestionably' CNN's finest moment; and about how his obsessive hate for rival Rupert Murdoch has mellowed to a mild dislike. 'He's an easy person not to like. I don't hate him... I have hated him but, as Martin Luther King said, hate is a burden to bear.' </p> <p>In place of the fighting talk of recent times is an alarming acceptance of Murdoch's position in the world. 'I don't want to talk about Rupert today. I've said enough about Rupert to last a lifetime. </p> <p>'I just wish him the best of luck with his new young wife. I heard he had a mild case of cancer so I hope he gets healthy soon. My fingers are not crossed.' </p> <p>When it comes to his own media interests, Turner is already working at arm's length. Asked about accusations of news broadcasters dumbing down, Turner replies: 'There's always been some news media that try and exploit the dumbing down of news. And there's a lot of pressure because the dumber you are, a lot of times that will get a bigger audience. And we're not immune from it. We ran a lot of stuff on OJ Simpson; we ran a lot of stuff on the death of Diana.' </p> <p>And then comes a story of how, earlier this week, he thought twice before intervening in the day-to-day editorial decision-making of CNN. </p> <p>'On CNN Headline News... the China trade bill being approved was second and we led with something very small; maybe a school kid killed the teacher or something. I was just appalled. I almost called in, but I didn't - and an hour later they'd reversed the stories.' You get the feeling that, five years ago, Turner would have made that call. </p> <p>And the issue comes up again, as Turner is asked what his latest editorial con tribution to CNN was. 'Most recently I've asked them to do a major series of stories on the nuclear weapon situation because it's gone off people's radar... That's one of the stories recently but I don't do it all the time because CNN do a pretty good job of going out and digging up the stories.' </p> <p>Laudable in intent, but a world away from the strategic synergy talk of the suits leading the AOL Time Warner. </p> <p>Looking ahead to his own place in the media of the future, he's equally sanguine about the news agenda 20 years from now. 'I hope we'll be doing what we're doing today,' he says. 'Reporting the news honestly and fairly with a strong emphasis on international news... I wish we were more accurate and better but you can always find things to criticise. Generally I'm pretty pleased with it.' </p> <p>So how will he protect his beloved CNN? 'All you can do is the best that you can. It's one reason why I merged with Time Warner. Rupert Murdoch wanted to acquire CNN five years ago, 10 years ago. That's how I got to know him. And he was very charming. </p> <p>'But I studied what he stood for in journalism and Time was best. So I thought that merging with a company that had a history of strong journalistic integrity would be best. </p> <p>'There's no way you can prepare for every eventuality. Some bad person could take over Time Warner. I mean it could happen, but you have to go with the odds and you can't stay forever. </p> <p>'I couldn't stay here forever anyway. You get too old or you die. Crazy Horse, the great Indian chief, was fighting against American soldiers with guns and all he had was a bow and arrow. He said only the rocks live forever and that's right.'</p>",

While Snook's enthusiasm is a marvellous thing to behold, it is easy to detach his proselytising from some cold, hard common sense. That \u00a330bn seems to be a hefty price for Orange is not in doubt, even France T\u00e9l\u00e9com's finance director was of the opinion that it was 'not cheap'. </p> <p>Snook has never, in fairness, gone on the record to defend the price paid, but he can be satisfied that his wizardry at brand- and service- building should have been so successful as to make the French hand over such a huge quantity of weak euros. </p> <p>Being big in the game is for now more important than being profitable. Which is why Orange commanded such a high price to keep the French in competition with Chris Gent's Vodafone Mannesmann. Being religiously sceptical about anything that might capture the markets' imagination, it is as well to ask whether the hurry to acquire mass mobility hasn't lost sight of the ultimate value of the industry. </p> <p>Snook's Mr 300 per cent act is charming and, when our TVs are in fact big-screen telephones with high-speed internet downloads instead of quaint cathode ray tubes, we may indeed have a device for every day of the week. However, as the country and indeed the Continent expect talk to become ever cheaper, and even free, the expectations of third-generation and Wap phones (unkindly dubbed Crap phones by some) are high indeed. In fact Vodafone expects that an outlay of \u00a380bn on 3G licences will yield 15 per cent, or more than \u00a390bn over 20-years. </p> <p>Inflationary pressure will ease this burden, but it either means subscribers paying more, or penetration soaring, and quickly. Supplying your customers with free improving technology while they expect bills to fall will be tricky, if not impossible. </p> <p>But at least Snook has time and a large protected French monopoly on his side. The tanking of the first wave of 3G expectations (due to happen in about a year's time), may shake out the weaker players and dent stocks, but Orange and Vodafone are in the gladiatorial ring for the long slog. What will test the faith of investors is if Snook's penetration bottoms out, so to speak, at nearer 75 per cent than 300 per cent, or if there is another major health scare (as there is almost bound to be), or if one of the third- placed competitors starts a kamikaze mission to make prices unsustainably low. </p> <p>Like the internet, mobile telephony will only proliferate. So far it has had the drop on the net because it has been able to charge for its product and will benefit from the initial plague of technoliterates spending hours surfing the net via their utterly inadequate handsets. It benefits from comparisons with the highly transitory valuations attached to far flimsier companies, such as Freeserve. </p> <p>But one can't help feeling that we consumers will be asked to part with more cash than we would strictly like for the pleasure of having our ears fried and our eyes strained. </p> <p>And this is where Snook's vision comes apart for many. We would all quite gladly buy into the utopia which has us watching the web from the train, plane and automobile, and even that has us being penetrated by 100 per cent. The fashion-conscious would even acquiesce to the idea of a device for every day of the week. </p> <p>But buying into a vision is one thing. Paying for the bloody thing is quite another. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:emily.bell@observer.co.uk\">emily.bell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

That \u00a330bn seems to be a hefty price for Orange is not in doubt, even France T\u00e9l\u00e9com's finance director was of the opinion that it was 'not cheap'. Snook has never, in fairness, gone on the record to defend the price paid, but he can be satisfied that his wizardry at brand- and service- building should have been so successful as to make the French hand over such a huge quantity of weak euros. Being big in the game is for now more important than being profitable. Which is why Orange commanded such a high price to keep the French in competition with Chris Gent's Vodafone Mannesmann. Being religiously sceptical about anything that might capture the markets' imagination, it is as well to ask whether the hurry to acquire mass mobility hasn't lost sight of the ultimate value of the industry. Snook's Mr 300 per cent act is charming and, when our TVs are in fact big-screen telephones with high-speed internet downloads instead of quaint cathode ray tubes, we may indeed have a device for every day of the week. However, as the country and indeed the Continent expect talk to become ever cheaper, and even free, the expectations of third-generation and Wap phones (unkindly dubbed Crap phones by some) are high indeed. In fact Vodafone expects that an outlay of \u00a380bn on 3G licences will yield 15 per cent, or more than \u00a390bn over 20-years. Inflationary pressure will ease this burden, but it either means subscribers paying more, or penetration soaring, and quickly. Supplying your customers with free improving technology while they expect bills to fall will be tricky, if not impossible. But at least Snook has time and a large protected French monopoly on his side. The tanking of the first wave of 3G expectations (due to happen in about a year's time), may shake out the weaker players and dent stocks, but Orange and Vodafone are in the gladiatorial ring for the long slog. What will test the faith of investors is if Snook's penetration bottoms out, so to speak, at nearer 75 per cent than 300 per cent, or if there is another major health scare (as there is almost bound to be), or if one of the third- placed competitors starts a kamikaze mission to make prices unsustainably low. Like the internet, mobile telephony will only proliferate. So far it has had the drop on the net because it has been able to charge for its product and will benefit from the initial plague of technoliterates spending hours surfing the net via their utterly inadequate handsets. It benefits from comparisons with the highly transitory valuations attached to far flimsier companies, such as Freeserve. But one can't help feeling that we consumers will be asked to part with more cash than we would strictly like for the pleasure of having our ears fried and our eyes strained. And this is where Snook's vision comes apart for many. We would all quite gladly buy into the utopia which has us watching the web from the train, plane and automobile, and even that has us being penetrated by 100 per cent. The fashion-conscious would even acquiesce to the idea of a device for every day of the week. But buying into a vision is one thing. Paying for the bloody thing is quite another. emily.bell@observer.co.uk",

In what was being seen as a carefully choreographed move to make Camilla's relationship with Prince Charles acceptable to the public, the meeting was arranged to take place at a birthday party for exiled Greek King Constantine and was being billed as a significant thawing in the Queen's attitude to her son and heir's relationship with the divorcee. It is understood that the Queen knew Parker Bowles, 52, would be among the guests at the party at Highgrove near Tetbury in Gloucestershire when she decided to attend. A Palace spokesman said: 'The Queen attended a birthday party for King Constantine given by the Prince of Wales at Highgrove this lunchtime and Mrs Parker Bowles was among the guests.' It is understood that the two women met during the party, also attended by King Harald of Norway and Queen Margrethe of Denmark. The Queen has known Camilla Parker Bowles for many years, before and after her failed marriage to Andrew Parker Bowles, but has rarely met her in public or private. News of the meeting was first revealed by the News of the World . The paper's editor, Rebekah Wade, is known to be close to the Camilla camp. Her fiance, former EastEnders' star Ross Kemp, is a patron of Camilla's charity, the National Osteoporosis Society. Wade and Kemp are regular guests at fund-raising parties for the charity.

If you believe the clich\u00e9 this was, of course, because Lancastrians are schooled to play the game in the omnipresent Stygian gloom of Manchester. In fact they amassed a substantial total because of the excellence of Atherton against the swinging ball, the inability of the Zimbabwean bowlers to control it and Schofield's endearing wit with the bat. </p> <p>Atherton gave us a mini-masterclass against the moving ball. Admittedly he could watch it pass harmlessly to the keeper on far too many occasions. If not, the head remained perfectly still; he moved into position late and played late, allowing the ball to meet the middle of his blade, rather than going off in pursuit of it. Some of his cover-driving was exquisite. </p> <p>The England opener was already in the comfort zone when play began a mere 75 minutes late: 96 not out and the prospect of facing the weakest Test attack in the world. He chalked up his fourteenth Test century and the fiftieth of his first class career without too much trouble. He clipped his first ball from Whittall through mid-wicket for three. Next he played a maiden, which included several bouncers from Neil Johnson; then a controlled pull in Johnson's next over and he was there. </p> <p>He now has one more Test hundred to his name than Alec Stewart; Graeme Hick has scored 60 more first class centuries. The first statistic interests him more. Atherton, I suspect, will enjoy the central contract system. In recent times he has not appeared to enjoy county cricket or prosper in it; he's never been a voracious gleaner of runs like Mike Gatting or Graham Gooch, who scored a vast number of county runs seemingly at will; Atherton needs plenty of mental energy to bat well. Being spared his Lancastrian duties for much of the forthcoming seasons could prolong his career. How David Gower would have enjoyed a central contract, not to mention Bob Willis. </p> <p>Stewart never settled. Half-forward to a gentle swinging delivery from Whittall he became the first of three lbw victims, having added just one to his overnight score. Flower immediately took the new ball, which swung prodigiously but his bowlers could not control it. Their champion, Heath Streak, was as culpable as any. Even so Nick Knight soon departed. It had been rumoured that he had cured his problem of falling over to the off-side, his head too close to cover point and playing around his front pad. Not yet he hasn't. He received a gentle, regulation inswinger from Whittall and missed it. This presented a fine opportunity for Andrew Flintoff but he could not take advantage. </p> <p>He delivered a couple of thumping drives but soon tried to pull Mbangwa and was palpably lbw. Chris Schofield, in pursuit of his first Test run, fared much better. He began with a punched back-foot drive for three and then proceeded to bat with a quirkiness all too reminiscent of Jack Russell. There are plenty of moving parts when Schofield is at the crease; he drives with a flourish though not always a straight bat and there was an eccentric falling hook - not quite so elegant as Rohan Kanhai in his pomp - that landed fortuitously in front of Mbangwa at long leg before spinning out of reach to the boundary. This pair of Lancastrians added another 39 and surprisingly Atherton was the one to go - in an unusual manner for him, caught at extra cover driving at Mbangwa. </p> <p>For once he forgot to wait for the ball and instead cracked it in the air straight to Grant Flower. He cannot claim to be duped by a slower ball for it was delivered at 70mph, the pace of Mbangwa's stock delivery. </p> <p>Caddick holed out to mid-off as people tend to do off Nkala and Gough edged to give Streak his solitary wicket. All the while Schofield improvised cleverly; there was a reverse sweep to bring up his 50, an even more audacious upper cut from a Streak bouncer before he sacrificed himself with a declaration imminent. If he can bowl as well... Later his solitary over in Test cricket yielded nine runs. </p> <p>For Zimbabwe, Grant Flower's horrendous run continued when caught at bat/pad in Gough's first over.

      "bodyText": "It was a bowler's day at Nottingham: a lot of swing and a little seam. So Zimbabwe's response to England's 374 is not so bad as it sounds. Fifty-one for two is about par for the course, but it still leaves them with much work to do to save this match. England could have done with more than 13 overs at their opponents, two of which were wasted by a rusty-looking Andrew Caddick. Indeed in another era the England captain might have have declared in mid-afternoon yesterday. It was dank and humid and the ball was bending in the air venomously - prime conditions for England's trio of pacemen. But in the current climate unorthodox declarations arouse too many suspicions.

      "body": "<p>If Martin O'Neill thinks with half as much emotional intensity as he watches football, he must have been exhausted by the time he actually put pen to paper in Glasgow. All week long he had been deliberating, wavering, considering his options. Like the good and bad angels from a medieval morality play, you can imagine the Leicester voice and the Celtic voice fighting it out in his head. 'Ah, Martin,' said the Celtic voice, temptingly, 'Follow your heart. Come to your promised land.' Bingo. </p> <p>'No, stay Martin,' interjected the Leicester City voice, persuasively, 'Why abandon it all for such a monumental risk?' Oh, decisions, decisions. </p> <p>Vacillation is not usually considered a virtue in football management. But the fact he took so long weighing it all up (not for the first time, as Nottingham Forest, Everton and Leeds can testify) should not necessarily be interpreted as a weakness. Actually in his case it's a strength. The fact that he cares enough to give so much thought to his dilemmas reveals a considerate side which his players seem to warm to, certainly those who phoned him to wish him luck the evening he finally confirmed his departure. Leicester's spirit of loyalty and effort and togetherness stems from the character of the manager. </p> <p>He is concerned that critics might give him a black mark for leaving Leicester in the lurch, which was never his intention and is the basic reason why he pondered so long and hard. One of his priorities is to find a day to go back there to say his farewells. 'Obviously after four-and-a-half years there's a great attachment,' he explains. 'I had a lot of time for a lot of people there. The set-up was excellent. In the end, however strongly I felt about Leicester I couldn't turn this down. I suppose my background had an influence. Celtic are an absolutely massive club and they have been starved of success. It will not come easy, it's daunting but it's really exciting at the same time.' </p> <p>Those he's leaving behind must recognise this is the right moment for a gifted and ambitious man to extend himself. He has taken Leicester to its optimum level - top half of the Premiership, a Worthington Cup, Europe. City cannot realistically aspire to anything more right now. The only way for O'Neill to take the next step was to move on up. His career path so far gives him confidence: 'When I started in management at non-league level people said, \"Oh, he can't do it in the League\". When I got into the League people said \"Nah, he can't do it in the Premiership.\" After that is was, \"Well, he hasn't won the league yet.\" My Premiership record is good enough to suggest I should have a crack at managing a club of Celtic's size. If this job gives me the chance to expand on my talents, I'll be glad to.' </p> <p>So, this is the pursuit of a dream. The legends of the Lisbon Lions and Jock Stein - 'just immortalised up there', he gushes - genuinely stir his soul. No PR fluff, O'Neill means it. For Celtic supporters waiting in the drizzle to greet him, he is a saviour. There can be no more warming feeling for the faithful than to feel one of their own is in charge. Their welcome convinced O'Neill he had made the right decision. Having said that, an inbred affection and association is no instant recipe for success, as everyone knows. He will have to be ruthless to deliver as Celtic Football Club dream-maker. </p> <p>'Everything is brilliant except for the team,' he observed on his first day. There is much work to be done. Celtic play a more adventurous, fluid style of football than the competitive hustlers who thrived at Filbert Street. It will be fascinating to see if he has more creative strings to his bow at a club with the resources to acquire players with more star quality, and indeed how the Celtic squad respond to O'Neill's fervent brand of management. He is used to working with underrated achievers who drew strength from proving the doubters wrong. Multimillion-pound egos living with the fever of enormous expectation and profile in the green half of Glasgow are a different proposition. 'People may ask if he can manage people who cost \u00a35-6 million,' muses City old boy Steve Claridge. 'Personally I've got no doubts.' </p> <p>Nor has O'Neill: 'People forget I was involved in European football as a player and worked under a marvellous manager who didn't care about reputations. Trevor Francis arrived for \u00a31m and played his first game in the third team. As far as I'm concerned players are players. You might pick up Matt Elliott and Neil Lennon from lower clubs but these boys are top-quality players - and I've seen egos to match as well, Stan Collymore for example. </p> <p>'The idea is to try and win, and win with style. Talented players make exciting teams and if we can get some more to add to the obvious talent already there we have a chance. That is something I'm intending to build on.' </p> <p>Next week, he will have a day running through 'everything with everyone' at Celtic before taking home a video of each of last season's games for homework - but he will make no decisions until he has worked with the players himself. Pre-season training starts at the end of June (scuppering the family holiday) and any gaps from Euro 2000 TV commitments will be spent hot-footing it to Glasgow. </p> <p>Taking up the challenge of renovating a side that finished 21 points behind their only true rivals is evidence of the incorrigible romantic in O'Neill. In times when the essence of sport is increasingly polluted by Mammon, what a breath of fresh air it would be if the Ulsterman could make a success of it at Celtic Park. </p> <p>'I'll give it my very best shot, and if it doesn't work...

The players knew, the country knew and despite the best efforts of the nation's media to inject a degree of melodrama into the process - 'How will you actually break it to them, Kevin? Will it be the hardest thing you have ever done?' - the cull was achieved as quietly and sensibly as professionals have a right to expect. </p> <p>No story there then, unless Andy Cole suddenly decides he is not injured after all and complains another England manager has got it in for him. Until that happens, the real story is who made it into the squad. Did Gareth Barry imagine as recently as a month ago he would be in the final 22 for the European Championships? Steven Gerrard has been more frequently mentioned as a possibility, but the Liverpool midfielder made his debut only on Wednesday and up to that point could not possibly have been expecting to edge out more senior players. </p> <p>And what about Nick Barmby? Not even considered for the Argentina game, by Keegan's own admission, Barmby had been planning a family holiday in America this summer until a sparkling 20-minute cameo against Ukraine put him straight into the 22 with a reasonable chance of figuring in England's starting line-up against Portugal. </p> <p>'Nick has made a late run,' said Keegan, stating the obvi ous but also making use of one of the game's best-loved romantic scenarios. Everybody knows that Geoff Hurst made a late run into Alf Ramsey's thinking in 1966, and ended up the hero of the hour. Keegan, one feels, was looking for someone to make a late run. He would have been disappointed if none of his 28 had managed to surprise him. </p> <p>Without veering into Hoddlesque crankiness, Keegan seems to believe in fate, or at least that events should be allowed to unfold without excessive interference from him. His whole philosophy is that England will come good in Euro 2000 when the time arrives, so the more players making unanswerable cases for selection the merrier. </p> <p>That is why Barmby could be in or around the Portugal game. On the evidence of Wednesday's performance, he could easily shade the other form midfielder, Steve McManaman, for the left-sided midfield role. </p> <p>McManaman had a reasonable game against Ukraine, though it is clearly unreasonable to expect him to reproduce his Real Madrid performances. It remains to be seen how effective the new, improved McManaman would be playing on the left in a 4-4-2 formation, but Keegan now knows Barmby can be effective just about anywhere. </p> <p>Neither would Keegan hesitate to make a late, unexpected change. Apart from the fact that he is mildly obsessed with the way Ramsey went about things in 1966, Keegan happens to believe an England team need to be kept on their toes. </p> <p>'You can't just walk in as an England manager and say \"Right, this is going to happen\",' he said. 'You have to give the players time to get used to the new situation. It's only now that I look at them and think I've got them really together and ready, for instance. </p> <p>'I've brought one or two surprise players into the squad, and the senior players are never quite comfortable about that. They wonder what I have in mind, which is only natural, but that's a good thing. You don't really want a team or a squad which picks itself. I certainly don't want too many of our players on comfort street.' </p> <p>Sentiments most people would share, even if Keegan has been less than ruthless in disturbing the comfort zone that Alan Shearer has inhabited this past 15 months. </p> <p>Barmby, who scored the first England goal under Glenn Hoddle in Moldova but lost form and spent almost four years outside the England reckoning, would be happy to help Keegan out anywhere on the pitch. </p> <p>'I like to play quite far upfield but just behind the main strikers, and it doesn't make much difference whether I play in the centre, wide right or even out on the left,' he said. 'England are currently bemoaning the lack of a natural left-footer, but it's not as if everyone else has got one. If you look at a lot of Italian sides you just see four good midfielders spread across the pitch, and the guy out on the left is often right footed. I'm not sure it's the specialist position people make out.' </p> <p>Just as well, since England lost their last specialist when Jason Wilcox pulled out. With better finishing ahead of Barmby on Wednesday, England could have turned a comfortable victory into something more impressive, since before the introduction of the Everton player the Ukraine defence were coping easily with what little was being produced from open play. </p> <p>In the final analysis both England goals came from dead-ball situations and involved errors from a young and inexperienced goalkeeper, whereas Nigel Martyn was given a thorough workout by a Ukraine team operat ing at far from full throttle. Assuming that the defence will tighten when England revert to a back four, which in turn assumes England would not dare begin a tournament with one wing-back over- committed to attack and the other reluctant to stray too far from defence, the supply of goals appears to be the most pressing problem. </p> <p>Shearer and Michael Owen will get first opportunity, and everyone is hoping the former can rise to the occasion as he did in Euro 96, since Emile Heskey is not exactly giving Keegan a selection headache. Had Cole missed the sort of chance Heskey squandered at Wembley, he would never have heard the last of it. </p> <p>Yet say what you will about Keegan and his squad, the manager is at least facing the firing squad bravely and without a blindfold. 'This is an exciting opportunity, and I want everyone to enjoy it,' he said. 'I think the fans can look forward with optimism. They can write us off if they want, I don't know what their definition of success or failure would be, but if you are asking me we have got to be thinking about trying to win the competition. </p> <p>'I know that's difficult, but that's what the players are focusing on, and I don't see anybody with a better chance. As a nation we have under-achieved for quite a long time, and I just want us to play to our maximum. We have a chance if we play like we really can. I can't honestly say that's happened under me yet, but a tournament would be a great time to do it.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "It will surely go down as the most ambitious stage production ever mounted by a cast of four: astrophysics, sex, love, betrayal and religion - all covered in two brief acts. God and Stephen Hawking , a new play starring Robert Hardy as God and Stephen Boxer as Hawking, tackles some of the biggest philosophical questions out there. The play - already billed as 'a major new theatrical production' and 'an extraordinary revelation of the life and vision of one of the most famous and revered men on the planet' - goes into rehearsal next month and has been written by Robin Hawdon with the co-operation of Hawking's first wife, Jane. It does not, though, have the blessing of the professor himself. Hawking, the wheelchair-bound theoretical physicist of world renown, is known for his dislike of public interest in his personal life. Publicity for the show, to tour the regions this summer before making a bid for a transfer to the West End, says the script was written 'without the specific consent and co-operation' of Hawking. Hawdon's script is based largely on descriptions of phe nomena such as The Big Bang and black holes from Hawking's hugely successful book, A Brief History of Time . 'I have tried to explain, fairly simplistically, a lot of the ideas in the book, which, let's face it, was written to introduce the layman to science,' said Hawdon, whose other work includes The Mating Game, and adaptations of Kingsley Amis's The Old Devils and Marc Camoletti's farce Don't Dress for Dinner .

With her husband's consent she had a boyfriend during their marriage, but in 1990 the professor left her, and their three children, after 25 years. Hawdon said he was careful to paraphrase many of Hawking's major theories for copyright reasons. The playwright hopes to capture the interest of at least some of the 25 million readers who have bought A Brief History for his show, which opens at the Theatre Royal Bath and is directed by Jonathan Church. 'The interest is obviously out there,' Hawdon said, adding that he suspects that some of those who did not make it through the whole book will come along to see the stage play instead.

      "bodyText": "The bodies that hand out billions of pounds of Lottery money are to be ordered to abolish widespread regional discrepancies which mean some areas are getting the equivalent of a few pounds a head compared with the national average of \u00a390. Chris Smith, the Culture Secretary who has responsibility for the Lottery, will tell the committees which run the funds that they must make more effort to direct money into deprived areas. Smith hopes his action will play well in Labour's heartland areas which get the least money from the Lottery, described as a 'tax on the poor' because deprived areas spend most on it but receive the least back in grants. Figures compiled for Smith's department reveal that north-east Derbyshire gets just \u00a33.89 a head compared with between \u00a3150 and \u00a3200 a head in parts of central London, which has received huge Lottery cash injections for major projects such as the Royal Opera House, Tate Modern and the Dome. Other areas that have received very little Lottery money include Knowlsey in Liverpool at \u00a312 a head, Rotherham, also \u00a312, and south Staffordshire, with \u00a37.18 a head. Although Smith will praise action already taken by the Lottery distributors to give out cash more fairly, he will say more must be done. 'It was the well-heeled areas with good connections which took greatest advantage of the application process,' a Government source said. 'Poorer areas often don't have the large cultural institutions which have received huge amounts of cash and so they are missing out. We have to tackle that to make sure there is a fairer distribution of the money raised by the Lottery.' The areas, many of them at the heart of former coal mining areas, will be targeted by a special action team which will help local communities put together smaller scale Lottery bids. The six bodies that give out Lottery money - the Arts Council, the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Millennium Commission, the Charities Board, Sport England and the New Opportunities Fund - will also be told to allow greater flexibility in how they judge Lottery bids. Officials believe that smaller communities can miss out because they cannot afford the expensive consultants who put together major Lottery bids for city areas. They believe that the application process is too complex for many small organisations and must be simplified. The Government will also consider relaxing rules on partnership funding, the extra money groups applying for Lottery grants have to secure from other sources if their application is successful. A Government briefing paper says the bodies that hand out the money will have to 'bear in mind the role the Lottery can play in reducing economic and social deprivation'. The paper also says they need to 'ensure that all regions and parts of society can benefit from the Lottery'. Smith will highlight a pilot scheme in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, where \u00a33 million of cash was earmarked for the area before applications came in. Teams were then sent out to encourage applications from local groups and help was given putting together the complex documents required. Figures from Camelot, the company that runs the Lottery, reveal that areas such as Derby, Sunderland, Leeds and Keighley spend the most on Lottery tickets. People in Sunderland North have spent \u00a3143 million on tickets, but received only \u00a315 million back in grants. In London there are also wide discrepancies. Westminster and the City of London have done very well out of the Lottery, while Tottenham - whose residents spent \u00a363 million, the 14th highest amount, on tickets - has received just over \u00a35m in grants.

But in the latest manifestation of the Wagner family's endless internal feud, the coveted treasure is not a ring of gold but control of the annual Bayreuth festival and the composer's legacy.</p> <p>A 24-member committee will this week name a successor to Wolfgang Wagner, the composer's 80-year-old grandson who has run the festival for almost half a century. The three candidates are all Wagners - Wolfgang's wife Gudrun, his daughter Eva and his niece Nike - and they all loathe one another.</p> <p>Regardless of the committee's decision, however, it's clear that there is little chance of a smooth transfer of power at Bayreuth to a new generation.</p> <p>The latest twist in the tale began last year, when Wolfgang agreed that the procedure for choosing a successor should be set in motion, declaring that he did not want to continue running the festival 'as a mummy or a robot'.</p> <p>But in its eagerness to end Wolfgang's reign the committee neglected to secure from him a firm date of departure. When Wolfgang heard that the choice was likely to fall on Eva, rather than on his wife Gudrun, he announced that he had no intention of terminating his contract as festival director, which will end only with his death.</p> <p>Most insiders believe that Wolfgang's plan is to install the 56-year-old Gudrun as a caretaker director until their 22-year-old daughter Katharina, who has just finished a theatre studies degree, is ready to take over.</p> <p>But Nike a cultural historian who has long been the critics' favourite, is withering about Gudrun, who was Wolfgang's secretary before she became his wife.</p> <p>'Everybody knows that Gudrun reached her position as a collaborator through the marriage bed and not through art and culture. My guess is that our theatre and music people will regard her candidature as the laughing stock of the nation,' she said.</p> <p>Wagner family feuds are almost as much a part of Bayreuth tradition as the operas themselves. Although the festival is now controlled by a foundation and is partly financed from public funds, its constitution specifies that its director should 'in principle' be a Wagner.</p> <p>Wolfgang has been at odds with most of his family since 1976, when he told Playboy that none of his relations was fit to succeed him. Since then, he has banned his son Gottfried from setting foot in the opera house and dismissed his daughter Eva's work at Covent Garden and the Paris Opera as unimpressive.</p> <p>Nike has long been the most uncomfortable thorn in the old man's side, not least because of her claim that Wolfgang is guilty of suppressing information about the Wagner family's relationship with the Nazis.</p> <p>Hitler was a fanatical admirer of Wagner, becoming a close friend of the family long before he came to power in 1933. Wolfgang's English-born mother, Winifred, was especially close to Hitler, who once described her as 'the only person I could marry as F\u00fchrer'.</p> <p>Although the young Wolfgang referred to Hitler as 'Uncle Wolf', he was quick to distance himself from the Nazis after the Second World War and did his best to play down the family's links to the fascist leadership.</p> <p>With his brother, Wieland, Wolfgang defied international opposition to resurrect the festival in 1951 and assumed sole control of it after Wieland's death in 1966.</p> <p>The festival is undoubtedly a commercial success, with all performances sold out months in advance. But there are signs that Bayreuth is losing some of its artistic prestige. 'There must be a change, because the institution of Bayreuth and its director are both going senile,' according to Nike.</p> <p>Although a new production of the Ring opens this year, few Bayreuth productions have made a critical impact during the past three decades.</p> <p>Nike's solution is to effect a revolution at the theatre on the 'green hill', starting a second season around Whitsun to satisfy some of the demand for tickets and extending the repertoire to include some of Wagner's early works. She wants to bring the festival closer to local people by staging live performances in the town centre, and her most radical proposal is to perform works by modern and contemporary composers influenced by Wagner.</p> <p>'Bayreuth must be viewed in the context of the changes taking place in the world of opera at large. At the heart of the opera scene, its Wagner productions must be in keeping with its unique status. It must be able to offer a trendsetting, contemporary Wagner, and in doing so bridge the gap between late nineteenth-century Wagner and the twenty-first century,' she wrote last week.</p> <p>Wolfgang rejected Nike's plan as 'absurd', and by Thursday, Gudrun had published her own manifesto, a long-winded call to leave things more or less as they are. 'The Bayreuth festival must under no circumstances become a specialised repertory theatre, it must retain its singularity and the special circumstances of its way of life against all trends towards levelling out. The demand today is for evolution - by no means revolution,' she wrote.</p> <p>The committee looks certain to reject both Nike and Gudrun in favour of Eva, who has worked at Covent Garden and the Paris Opera and is currently an artistic adviser to the festival at Aix-en- Provence. Eva has taken the wise precaution of saying nothing about her plans for Bayreuth, but this reticence has not been enough to prevent a last-minute falling out with her cousin, Wieland Lafferentz, who runs the Mozarteum Foundation in Salz-burg. Lafferentz announced last week that he was no longer interested in running Bayreuth with Eva, whom he described as 'inexperienced', and that he now wanted to run the festival on his own.</p> <p>The latest bout of family feuding has prompted some Bavarian politicians to look at various ways of wresting control of Bayreuth from the Wagners. They argue that the festival is too important an element in Germany's culture to be left to the mercy of such a strikingly dysfunctional family.</p> <p>More optimistic observers hope that naming a successor will create such momentum for change that Wolfgang will feel obliged to step down sooner rather than later.</p> <p>But the old patriarch issued a warning last week that he would take his lead from Germany's disgraced former Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, and 'sit it out' until the committee agreed to appoint his wife to succeed him.</p> <p>\u0095 Denis Staunton writes for The Irish Times</p> <p><b>It's a dreary town, but the music is out of this world</b></p> <p>Bayreuth, a small, drab town of beer, sausages and cheap shoe shops, has no obvious charms as a shrine, writes Fiona Maddocks. Yet thousands of people from all over the world pay homage each year to the works of Richard Wagner (1813-1883), the obsessive, ambitious, visionary composer whose dream was to create a Complete Work of Art in which music, words and drama unite in a powerful whole. He wasn't Hitler's favourite composer though he may have been Goebbels's.</p> <p>Wagner built a theatre to his own specifications, aided financially by gay, mad King Ludwig II, on a green hill above the town at which the annual festival now takes place.</p> <p>Today this opera house, one of the best in the world acoustically, still serves its original purpose: to perform Wagner's music dramas and nothing else. It's a temple to high art and Germanic seriousness: no plush or gilt, just hard wooden seats; no Wagner T-shirts or key-rings, only his texts, in German, in the bookshop.</p> <p>Nowhere are audiences more attentive, singers and orchestra better prepared. It's done with love, and it shows. The waiting list extends for years ahead.</p> <p>Wagner's greatest achievement is The Ring , a complex four-part extrava ganza of dragons, dwarfs and incest sung in archaic German written by the composer himself.</p> <p>Much of it is set at the bottom of the Rhine. One of its most misappropriated highlights is 'The Ride of the Valkyries', in which eight war-maidens dance, ride or fly across the stage shrieking 'Hojotoho! Hojotoho!'. Performed over a week and lasting about 18 hours, depending on the speed of the conductor, it is the focus of the festival.</p> <p>It is one of the most complex and far-reaching works of art ever conceived. There's no other way to explain how you can spend a week in Bayreuth and say, in all honesty, you've had the time of your life.</p>",

But in the latest manifestation of the Wagner family's endless internal feud, the coveted treasure is not a ring of gold but control of the annual Bayreuth festival and the composer's legacy. A 24-member committee will this week name a successor to Wolfgang Wagner, the composer's 80-year-old grandson who has run the festival for almost half a century. The three candidates are all Wagners - Wolfgang's wife Gudrun, his daughter Eva and his niece Nike - and they all loathe one another. Regardless of the committee's decision, however, it's clear that there is little chance of a smooth transfer of power at Bayreuth to a new generation. The latest twist in the tale began last year, when Wolfgang agreed that the procedure for choosing a successor should be set in motion, declaring that he did not want to continue running the festival 'as a mummy or a robot'. But in its eagerness to end Wolfgang's reign the committee neglected to secure from him a firm date of departure. When Wolfgang heard that the choice was likely to fall on Eva, rather than on his wife Gudrun, he announced that he had no intention of terminating his contract as festival director, which will end only with his death. Most insiders believe that Wolfgang's plan is to install the 56-year-old Gudrun as a caretaker director until their 22-year-old daughter Katharina, who has just finished a theatre studies degree, is ready to take over. But Nike a cultural historian who has long been the critics' favourite, is withering about Gudrun, who was Wolfgang's secretary before she became his wife. 'Everybody knows that Gudrun reached her position as a collaborator through the marriage bed and not through art and culture. My guess is that our theatre and music people will regard her candidature as the laughing stock of the nation,' she said. Wagner family feuds are almost as much a part of Bayreuth tradition as the operas themselves. Although the festival is now controlled by a foundation and is partly financed from public funds, its constitution specifies that its director should 'in principle' be a Wagner. Wolfgang has been at odds with most of his family since 1976, when he told Playboy that none of his relations was fit to succeed him. Since then, he has banned his son Gottfried from setting foot in the opera house and dismissed his daughter Eva's work at Covent Garden and the Paris Opera as unimpressive. Nike has long been the most uncomfortable thorn in the old man's side, not least because of her claim that Wolfgang is guilty of suppressing information about the Wagner family's relationship with the Nazis. Hitler was a fanatical admirer of Wagner, becoming a close friend of the family long before he came to power in 1933. Wolfgang's English-born mother, Winifred, was especially close to Hitler, who once described her as 'the only person I could marry as F\u00fchrer'. Although the young Wolfgang referred to Hitler as 'Uncle Wolf', he was quick to distance himself from the Nazis after the Second World War and did his best to play down the family's links to the fascist leadership. With his brother, Wieland, Wolfgang defied international opposition to resurrect the festival in 1951 and assumed sole control of it after Wieland's death in 1966. The festival is undoubtedly a commercial success, with all performances sold out months in advance. But there are signs that Bayreuth is losing some of its artistic prestige. 'There must be a change, because the institution of Bayreuth and its director are both going senile,' according to Nike. Although a new production of the Ring opens this year, few Bayreuth productions have made a critical impact during the past three decades. Nike's solution is to effect a revolution at the theatre on the 'green hill', starting a second season around Whitsun to satisfy some of the demand for tickets and extending the repertoire to include some of Wagner's early works. She wants to bring the festival closer to local people by staging live performances in the town centre, and her most radical proposal is to perform works by modern and contemporary composers influenced by Wagner. 'Bayreuth must be viewed in the context of the changes taking place in the world of opera at large. At the heart of the opera scene, its Wagner productions must be in keeping with its unique status. It must be able to offer a trendsetting, contemporary Wagner, and in doing so bridge the gap between late nineteenth-century Wagner and the twenty-first century,' she wrote last week. Wolfgang rejected Nike's plan as 'absurd', and by Thursday, Gudrun had published her own manifesto, a long-winded call to leave things more or less as they are. 'The Bayreuth festival must under no circumstances become a specialised repertory theatre, it must retain its singularity and the special circumstances of its way of life against all trends towards levelling out. The demand today is for evolution - by no means revolution,' she wrote. The committee looks certain to reject both Nike and Gudrun in favour of Eva, who has worked at Covent Garden and the Paris Opera and is currently an artistic adviser to the festival at Aix-en- Provence. Eva has taken the wise precaution of saying nothing about her plans for Bayreuth, but this reticence has not been enough to prevent a last-minute falling out with her cousin, Wieland Lafferentz, who runs the Mozarteum Foundation in Salz-burg. Lafferentz announced last week that he was no longer interested in running Bayreuth with Eva, whom he described as 'inexperienced', and that he now wanted to run the festival on his own. The latest bout of family feuding has prompted some Bavarian politicians to look at various ways of wresting control of Bayreuth from the Wagners. They argue that the festival is too important an element in Germany's culture to be left to the mercy of such a strikingly dysfunctional family. More optimistic observers hope that naming a successor will create such momentum for change that Wolfgang will feel obliged to step down sooner rather than later. But the old patriarch issued a warning last week that he would take his lead from Germany's disgraced former Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, and 'sit it out' until the committee agreed to appoint his wife to succeed him. \u0095 Denis Staunton writes for The Irish Times It's a dreary town, but the music is out of this world Bayreuth, a small, drab town of beer, sausages and cheap shoe shops, has no obvious charms as a shrine, writes Fiona Maddocks. Yet thousands of people from all over the world pay homage each year to the works of Richard Wagner (1813-1883), the obsessive, ambitious, visionary composer whose dream was to create a Complete Work of Art in which music, words and drama unite in a powerful whole. He wasn't Hitler's favourite composer though he may have been Goebbels's. Wagner built a theatre to his own specifications, aided financially by gay, mad King Ludwig II, on a green hill above the town at which the annual festival now takes place. Today this opera house, one of the best in the world acoustically, still serves its original purpose: to perform Wagner's music dramas and nothing else. It's a temple to high art and Germanic seriousness: no plush or gilt, just hard wooden seats; no Wagner T-shirts or key-rings, only his texts, in German, in the bookshop. Nowhere are audiences more attentive, singers and orchestra better prepared. It's done with love, and it shows. The waiting list extends for years ahead. Wagner's greatest achievement is The Ring , a complex four-part extrava ganza of dragons, dwarfs and incest sung in archaic German written by the composer himself. Much of it is set at the bottom of the Rhine. One of its most misappropriated highlights is 'The Ride of the Valkyries', in which eight war-maidens dance, ride or fly across the stage shrieking 'Hojotoho! Hojotoho!'. Performed over a week and lasting about 18 hours, depending on the speed of the conductor, it is the focus of the festival. It is one of the most complex and far-reaching works of art ever conceived. There's no other way to explain how you can spend a week in Bayreuth and say, in all honesty, you've had the time of your life.",

Stuart William Newton was straight out of school, with a good family background, fit and keen and proud to be posted to one of the British Army's finest and most historic regiments.</p> <p>But last week a court martial heard how brutality and violence had turned a perfect recruit into a hunted man wanted for desertion.</p> <p>The transcript of the court- martial proceedings - a public document - reveals how the young rifleman from the King's Regiment went Awol after being humiliated in a twisted initiation rite and to escape a campaign of systematic bullying.</p> <p>Soon after arriving at the regiment, Newton and his unit were sent to Cyprus. One night at 2am the 17-year-old was awakened by violent banging on his door. Though he was nervous of initiation rites, he unlocked it carefully - only to be be grabbed by a group of older soldiers and dragged into another room.</p> <p>There, with two other new recruits, he was forced to strip and sing the company song with a crowd of soldiers jeering at his genitals. When he stumbled over the words he was forced to run naked around the barrack block.</p> <p>Far worse was to come. Over the next months his superiors in the unit subjected him to vicious bullying. The slightest infraction of orders - a less than perfectly cleaned room for example - resulted in punches to the head.</p> <p>On occasions Newton was made to stand with his eyes shut while a non-commissioned officer hit him with a clenched fist. When he was threatened with violence after discovering a money- lending ring among his fellow soldiers - with 100 per cent interest enforced by beatings by NCOs - Newton decided that he had to go Awol.</p> <p>His army dream in tatters, he became another statistic in the army legal services' log. The Army's Special Investigation Branch (SIB) has now launched an investigation. Lawyers for Newton refused to speak to The Observer .</p> <p>Newton's case is by no means isolated. Though the Army has made strenuous efforts to tackle bullying, the problem still persists.Legal sources say that the SIB is now running more than 30 inquiries into bullying and initiation rights in the Army.</p> <p>Robert Peterson, a solicitor specialising in personal injury claims by serving and former personnel, says that his firm alone has 60 complaints under way. Though almost all experts say that bullying is less prevalent now than it was a decade ago, it is still widespread.</p> <p>In the last three years Peterson and other solicitors have been involved in cases including allegations of:</p> <p>\u0095 Women soldiers made to parade in T-shirts soaked in water by male superiors;</p> <p>\u0095 A recruit allegedly tied to a cannon, stripped and then whipped with belts by NCOs;</p> <p>\u0095 Recruits being tied to beds or trees and urinated on;</p> <p>\u0095 Recruits being forced to undergo the 'regimental bath' - dunking in a tub filled with urine, vomit and sometimes faeces;</p> <p>\u0095 Recruits being beaten so badly they need hospital treatment;</p> <p>\u0095 Mock executions of servicemen;</p> <p>\u0095 A recruit beaten and threatened with being drowned in the sea.</p> <p>Certain forms of intitiation rite seem to be repeated. Many involve recruits being forcibly stripped. Often they have homoerotic overtones. Many of the complaints involve servicemen having their genitals or anus handled.</p> <p>Most of the rites and the bullying seem restricted to the junior ranks of infantry regiments but are not unknown in elite regiments, according to legal sources.</p> <p>With dozens of compensation claims to be decided by the High Court in the coming months, the Army faces a bill that could total several million pounds - but the impact will be more than financial.</p> <p>The Army is undertaking a massive recruitment drive and is committed to eradicating its image as racist, homophobic and full of bullying corporals. Every high-profile case makes changing that image harder.</p> <p>It is all a far cry from the vision of Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary. He has spoken of his desire for an up-to-date army offering an up-to-date career. Though many enlightened senior officers are trying to steer the Army in new directions, the military culture is proving resistant to change.</p> <p>Although the haemorrhaging of staff has largely been staunched in the last six months, the Army is still des perately short of men. Net recruitment is running at only 15 men each month and the 3,000 extra soldiers granted in the most recent Strategic Defence Review have yet to be found, and overall the Army is at least 7,000 under strength.</p> <p>An analysis of scores of courts-martial records reveals serious structural problems within the armed forces. Though many soldiers go absent to escape bullying, most unauthorised absences and desertions are caused by family problems.</p> <p>Soldiers are often serving a long way from their homes when a domestic crisis breaks and, senior officers admit, the Army is still poor at dealing with such situations.</p> <p>The courts-martial records - around 150 servicemen are court-martialled for absenteeism each year - are full of cases such as the infantry private prosecuted for going Awol to try to repair his relationship with his wife after tours of duty in Germany and Northern Ireland. His solicitor told the court that his client was \"fully aware of the seriousness of the offence but felt he had no option but to save his marriage\".</p> <p>Another soldier - a private in the 1st Battalion, The Cheshire Regiment - went Awol for nearly a year after his girlfriend told him to choose between the Army and her. A gunner in the 39th Royal Artillery Regiment disappeared after his girlfriend miscarried.</p> <p>Other soldiers - including experienced and motivated men - say they went Awol after being denied permission to take time off after finding that their parents or even spouses had fatal illnesses. Once absent, many men stay away from their units for fear of the punishment they will almost certainly receive.</p> <p>The Observer survey also reveals that many cases of absenteeism are provoked by lack of job satisfaction. Recruits who hope to be mechanics end up as gunners, in one case, or serving in infantry regiments. Despite training and 'life skills' being a major plank of army recruitment pitches, it is still often hard to establish any control over one's career as a junior soldier. After their attempts to transfer fail some run away.</p> <p>Senior military officers last week said that they were aware of both problems and a number of measures were being planned to improve welfare services on offer to servicemen.</p> <p>In a bid to ease the pressure on servicemen's relationships, the Government recently announced a bonus to be paid to soldiers with families who are separated from them for long periods.</p> <p>Many of the traditional barriers are starting to be broken down: there are now women artillery gunners and helicopter pilots and the number of ethnic minority troops is creeping up.</p> <p>The Government has also launched a series of measures to encourage recruitment. The ban on homosexuals has been lifted, there have been recruiting drives in young offenders' institutions and last week The Observer revealed that women were to be tested for combat roles for the first time.</p> <p>The Government, it seems, is prepared to countenance radical steps to tackle the problem. The question is whether they will be enough.</p> <p>Some time in the coming weeks the Royal Marines will follow The Parachute Regiment and pull out of the fetid Lungi airport and leave Sierra Leone to its dismal future.</p> <p>Their safe return - so far no British servicemen have been killed or injured - will be welcomed by more than just their friends and family. Recruitment officers throughout the country will breathe a sigh of relief. For the days when the prospect of a glorious death on the battlefield thrilled the nation's youth are long since gone.</p> <p>Experts all agree that any army reflects the society that produces it.</p> <p>'In Vietnam the discipline of the American Army fell apart as a result of race and drugs - both societal issues,' said Professor John A. Jackson, a sociologist specialising in the military at Trinity College, Dublin. 'That provoked a huge change in the American Army and the British Army is going through the same thing.'</p> <p>The Army would have to adjust to a 'less deferential, less hierarchical, less patriarchal' society to attract young people.</p> <p>'The old structures imposing discipline are breaking down and that poses great difficulties for an organisation that relies on unthinking and unquestioning obedience to orders.'</p> <p>Others point to the quality of life enjoyed by modern teenagers. 'They are used to having their own rooms at home, to going out, to taking drugs, to having girlfriends,' said Eric Joyce, a former major in the Adjutant-General's Corps whose campaign to highlight the problems of the Army and subsequent dismissal became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre .</p> <p>'As soldiers they live four to a room in poor accomodation miles from home - and miles from any girls who'll look at them. Neither the pay nor the lifestyle are really good enough to compensate for what they have to give up.</p> <p>'Few soldiers want to be doing what they do. They leave as soon as they can,' Joyce said.</p> <p>Stories of recruits having to do their initial training in trainers because their feet are too soft to cope with army combat boots reinforce the image of a soft nation increasingly ill at ease with the hard facts of traditional military service. The revelation of high-profile cases of bullying and racist or sexist harrassment do the Army's campaign to change its image a great deal of harm.</p> <p>The new commanding officer of the Household Division - which includes the Guards regiments, the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals - has made a point of implementing a zero-tolerance policy towards bullying among his troops.</p> <p>Jackson says that peace-keeping may provide one possible model for the future of the Army. 'It would involve emphasising different skills,' he said. 'Tolerance, problem-solving, compassion, flexibility and imagination as well as the use of force. It would be an army that is far closer to our modern, pluralistic society.'</p> <p>But such a change will take time. And it will come too late for Stuart William Newton.

The slightest infraction of orders - a less than perfectly cleaned room for example - resulted in punches to the head. On occasions Newton was made to stand with his eyes shut while a non-commissioned officer hit him with a clenched fist. When he was threatened with violence after discovering a money- lending ring among his fellow soldiers - with 100 per cent interest enforced by beatings by NCOs - Newton decided that he had to go Awol. His army dream in tatters, he became another statistic in the army legal services' log. The Army's Special Investigation Branch (SIB) has now launched an investigation. Lawyers for Newton refused to speak to The Observer . Newton's case is by no means isolated. Though the Army has made strenuous efforts to tackle bullying, the problem still persists.Legal sources say that the SIB is now running more than 30 inquiries into bullying and initiation rights in the Army. Robert Peterson, a solicitor specialising in personal injury claims by serving and former personnel, says that his firm alone has 60 complaints under way. Though almost all experts say that bullying is less prevalent now than it was a decade ago, it is still widespread. In the last three years Peterson and other solicitors have been involved in cases including allegations of: \u0095 Women soldiers made to parade in T-shirts soaked in water by male superiors; \u0095 A recruit allegedly tied to a cannon, stripped and then whipped with belts by NCOs; \u0095 Recruits being tied to beds or trees and urinated on; \u0095 Recruits being forced to undergo the 'regimental bath' - dunking in a tub filled with urine, vomit and sometimes faeces; \u0095 Recruits being beaten so badly they need hospital treatment; \u0095 Mock executions of servicemen; \u0095 A recruit beaten and threatened with being drowned in the sea. Certain forms of intitiation rite seem to be repeated. Many involve recruits being forcibly stripped. Often they have homoerotic overtones. Many of the complaints involve servicemen having their genitals or anus handled. Most of the rites and the bullying seem restricted to the junior ranks of infantry regiments but are not unknown in elite regiments, according to legal sources. With dozens of compensation claims to be decided by the High Court in the coming months, the Army faces a bill that could total several million pounds - but the impact will be more than financial. The Army is undertaking a massive recruitment drive and is committed to eradicating its image as racist, homophobic and full of bullying corporals. Every high-profile case makes changing that image harder. It is all a far cry from the vision of Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary. He has spoken of his desire for an up-to-date army offering an up-to-date career. Though many enlightened senior officers are trying to steer the Army in new directions, the military culture is proving resistant to change. Although the haemorrhaging of staff has largely been staunched in the last six months, the Army is still des perately short of men. Net recruitment is running at only 15 men each month and the 3,000 extra soldiers granted in the most recent Strategic Defence Review have yet to be found, and overall the Army is at least 7,000 under strength. An analysis of scores of courts-martial records reveals serious structural problems within the armed forces. Though many soldiers go absent to escape bullying, most unauthorised absences and desertions are caused by family problems. Soldiers are often serving a long way from their homes when a domestic crisis breaks and, senior officers admit, the Army is still poor at dealing with such situations. The courts-martial records - around 150 servicemen are court-martialled for absenteeism each year - are full of cases such as the infantry private prosecuted for going Awol to try to repair his relationship with his wife after tours of duty in Germany and Northern Ireland. His solicitor told the court that his client was \"fully aware of the seriousness of the offence but felt he had no option but to save his marriage\". Another soldier - a private in the 1st Battalion, The Cheshire Regiment - went Awol for nearly a year after his girlfriend told him to choose between the Army and her. A gunner in the 39th Royal Artillery Regiment disappeared after his girlfriend miscarried. Other soldiers - including experienced and motivated men - say they went Awol after being denied permission to take time off after finding that their parents or even spouses had fatal illnesses. Once absent, many men stay away from their units for fear of the punishment they will almost certainly receive. The Observer survey also reveals that many cases of absenteeism are provoked by lack of job satisfaction. Recruits who hope to be mechanics end up as gunners, in one case, or serving in infantry regiments. Despite training and 'life skills' being a major plank of army recruitment pitches, it is still often hard to establish any control over one's career as a junior soldier. After their attempts to transfer fail some run away. Senior military officers last week said that they were aware of both problems and a number of measures were being planned to improve welfare services on offer to servicemen. In a bid to ease the pressure on servicemen's relationships, the Government recently announced a bonus to be paid to soldiers with families who are separated from them for long periods. Many of the traditional barriers are starting to be broken down: there are now women artillery gunners and helicopter pilots and the number of ethnic minority troops is creeping up. The Government has also launched a series of measures to encourage recruitment. The ban on homosexuals has been lifted, there have been recruiting drives in young offenders' institutions and last week The Observer revealed that women were to be tested for combat roles for the first time. The Government, it seems, is prepared to countenance radical steps to tackle the problem. The question is whether they will be enough. Some time in the coming weeks the Royal Marines will follow The Parachute Regiment and pull out of the fetid Lungi airport and leave Sierra Leone to its dismal future. Their safe return - so far no British servicemen have been killed or injured - will be welcomed by more than just their friends and family. Recruitment officers throughout the country will breathe a sigh of relief. For the days when the prospect of a glorious death on the battlefield thrilled the nation's youth are long since gone. Experts all agree that any army reflects the society that produces it. 'In Vietnam the discipline of the American Army fell apart as a result of race and drugs - both societal issues,' said Professor John A. Jackson, a sociologist specialising in the military at Trinity College, Dublin. 'That provoked a huge change in the American Army and the British Army is going through the same thing.' The Army would have to adjust to a 'less deferential, less hierarchical, less patriarchal' society to attract young people. 'The old structures imposing discipline are breaking down and that poses great difficulties for an organisation that relies on unthinking and unquestioning obedience to orders.' Others point to the quality of life enjoyed by modern teenagers. 'They are used to having their own rooms at home, to going out, to taking drugs, to having girlfriends,' said Eric Joyce, a former major in the Adjutant-General's Corps whose campaign to highlight the problems of the Army and subsequent dismissal became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre . 'As soldiers they live four to a room in poor accomodation miles from home - and miles from any girls who'll look at them. Neither the pay nor the lifestyle are really good enough to compensate for what they have to give up. 'Few soldiers want to be doing what they do. They leave as soon as they can,' Joyce said. Stories of recruits having to do their initial training in trainers because their feet are too soft to cope with army combat boots reinforce the image of a soft nation increasingly ill at ease with the hard facts of traditional military service. The revelation of high-profile cases of bullying and racist or sexist harrassment do the Army's campaign to change its image a great deal of harm. The new commanding officer of the Household Division - which includes the Guards regiments, the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals - has made a point of implementing a zero-tolerance policy towards bullying among his troops. Jackson says that peace-keeping may provide one possible model for the future of the Army. 'It would involve emphasising different skills,' he said. 'Tolerance, problem-solving, compassion, flexibility and imagination as well as the use of force. It would be an army that is far closer to our modern, pluralistic society.' But such a change will take time. And it will come too late for Stuart William Newton. He was found not guilty because he was under duress - but his hopes of a life as a soldier are gone. Rocked by scandal DRUGS: March 2000 - The Parachute Regiment is the latest to be caught in a drugs scandal with 12 men busted for cocaine, heroin, amphetamines and cannabis in a random drugs test. SEX: February 1999 - The relationship between Lieutenant-Colonel Keith Pople (below) and a younger servicewoman is splashed all over the nation's newspapers, prompting red faces at the MoD and changes in regulations on adultery in the forces. RACE: March 1999 - 15 soldiers arrested by Special Branch and MoD police for alleged links to neo-Nazi organisations. HARASSMENT: February 2000 - Royal Marines weapons instructor found guilty of simulating sex with a female trainee and telling others that they would pass tests if they went out with him.

Six days ago Wright helped Ipswich into the Premiership and there were uncanny similarities yesterday.

Everyone knows what happened in Euro 96, but Shearer was part of a highly effective partnership with Teddy Sheringham then. There is no evidence of anything so productive this time. Until Emile Heskey took over from Shearer the England attack was blunt, with their only goal coming from a defender. </p> <p>Martin Keown had a goal disallowed in the 11th minute but he was uncomfortable in a back four that was never allowed to settle. Carmel Busuttil and Gilbert Agius proved quicker on the turn than Keown and Sol Campbell on several occasions. </p> <p>None of this seemed likely to matter once England took the lead after 23 minutes, when a David Beckham free-kick found Keown unmarked for a far-post header, though somewhat comically Malta were back on level terms within six minutes. Barmby missed a chance to put England comfortably ahead when he headed straight at Ernest Barry, and regretted it almost immediately when Malta broke out of defence. David Carabott reacted quicker than the England defence to Noel Turner's long ball through the middle, but though Wright was left exposed, he showed his inexperience in rushing from his line and colliding with the Maltese striker. The referee delighted the locals by pointing to the spot, then incensed them once Carabott had scored by demanding the penalty be retaken. Carabott went the same way the second time but this time struck Wright's right-hand upright, only for the ball to rebound into goal off the hapless goalkeeper. </p> <p>Shearer was substituted five minutes into the second half, by which stage England could easily have been a goal down. Turner looked suspiciously offside in the 46th minute, but the flag stayed down and he really should have scored, or at least tested Wright, instead of giving Gary Neville time to make a vital block. </p> <p>Though at no time could either Heskey or England be described as impressive, his arrival brought a more defined attacking edge. Paul Scholes flashed a near-post shot wide from Heskey's cross, then the substitute himself got on the end of a Barmby cross from the left only to miss with a tame header when scoring looked easier. Goals are not really Heskey's forte, though it was the Liverpool player who provided the winner 15 minutes from the end, finishing from five yards out with Barmby once again the provider. </p> <p>Heskey's first international goal should have spared England's blushes, though there were more of those for Wright two minutes before the end. Once again England were caught square to a through-ball, and this time Wright was hesitant, coming out later rather than sooner and clearly bringing down Nenad Veselji. He redeemed himself by not only saving Carabott's penalty but throwing himself at a second effort by Veselji moments later. </p> <p>Debutants and goalkeepers usually prefer quiet lives, and Wright will have been relieved to hear the final whistle.

Three weeks ago Mrs Stockell's husband witnessed the Americans carrying Gayle into a car. They told him they were taking her to Hastings for the day. 'I was immediately suspicious, my mother couldn't possible travel,' Mrs Stockell said. She alerted Heathrow police and Special Branch, who detained the party at check-in. Meanwhile Tony Gayle raced down from Oxford to confront them. 'As Tony and the police turned their back, they got away - raced to another part of the airport,' Mrs Stockell said. Both Mr Gayle and Ms Stockell have taken legal action to block the funeral, intending to bury their mother near her home in Sutton Valence. The body is now with a coroner. 'Not content with taking her without our consent, they've now silently returned her,' Mr Gayle said yesterday. 'Did they expect us not to find out? Did they think we'd just forget about our mother?'",

It is now thought likely to form part of the speech that Dyke will give at the Edinburgh Television Festival on 25 August, although a final decision on the changes has not yet been made. Dyke is also believed to be weighing up the benefits of moving BBC2's Newsnight back to an 11pm slot and, more controversially still, of introducing a greater commercial ethos throughout the corporation. This week several of those working high in the management of television news have privately admitted they are confidently awaiting the birth of a longer flagship news programme to replace the Nine O'Clock News later this year. 'The news bulletin which goes out at nine may well be something of a British institution, but Greg is determined to believe that he can build his own institutions,' said one source at the top of the news division. The move would be a belated response to ITN's decision, over a year ago, to stop running its popular News at Ten .

The Observer has learnt that Robert Morgan, who spent four months in jail after he drove through a red signal into another train, wants his conviction overturned due to fresh evidence about the layout of signalling at the crash site. His decision comes as the inquiry into last year's Paddington disaster hears of weaknesses across a 'complacent' privatised industry that puts profits before safety. A safety campaigner this weekend called for rail industry bosses to be put behind bars if the Cullen inquiry into Paddington finds their companies were negligent.The inquiry has heard how a multitude of failings by the industry combined to cause the disaster. Thames Trains rejected a \u00a35 million plan to fit automatic train protection to its vehicles, which would have prevented the crash, but paid dividends to shareholders worth more than \u00a37 million. The inquiry has also heard that Railtrack signallers failed to switch the points or radio the driver when the signal was passed at danger because they regarded it as 'just another spad' and expected the driver to brake. There will be evidence, revealed in The Observer last month, that a misaligned rail could have jolted the Thames train to indicate wrongly the signal ahead as green.

      "body": "<p>Behind the glorious Art Deco fa\u00e7ade of its New York headquarters, one of the mainmasts of the world's media, Associated Press, is scrambling to salvage its credibility. Its most remarkable story of recent times has been thrown into doubt.</p> <p>The central and most compelling witness to AP's story of a shocking massacre by American forces has turned out to be a fake.</p> <p>AP and an investigative reporting team was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for unveiling the massacre of hundreds of Korean citizens - many of them women and children - by US troops on and around a bridge at No Gun Ri in July 1950. It was an atrocity second only to the Vietnam's My Lai massacre in America's book of shame.</p> <p>The story detonated consternation, soul-searching and praise. Last year it was splashed over every daily newspaper from the tabloids to the New York Times.</p> <p>Tom Brokaw, the superstar anchorman of Nightline, flew to Korea with Edward Daily, the GI who so vividly confessed his part in the carnage, for a tearful reunion with survivors. Daily became an overnight celebrity, embodying both the atrocity and the healing - survivors were in turn flown over to emotional prayer meetings in the US, 'reunited' with and hugging Daily.</p> <p>But after weeks of investigation, argument and counter-argument, AP has been forced into admitting that Daily could not have been at No Gun Ri. Further inquiries by The Observer show that even before the story was released, it was the subject of bitter argument at AP, with the president of the company himself unsure of its veracity.</p> <p>A military academic has condemned Daily's dazzling military career as fantastical. Daily's fabrication of his service record has him captured by the communist North Koreans, decorated for heroic antics and rescuing his platoon comrades under enemy fire. In fact, he was a mechanic in a lacklustre rear-echelon battalion.</p> <p>Daily was last week forced into admitting that he 'cannot dispute' the discovery that he is a fake, and has confessed to having gleaned his account from obsessive conversations at veterans' reunions.</p> <p>His hoax has ramifications beyond AP: at issue is not whether the massacre happened - which the Pentagon has all but confirmed - but whether the troops obeyed an order by firing, or acted on the spur of the moment.</p> <p>According to AP, there was an order: 'No refugees to cross frontline. Fire everyone trying to cross frontlines. Use discretion in case of women and children.' Daily had told AP: 'The command looked at it as getting rid of the problem the easiest way. That was to shoot them in a group.'</p> <p>As soon as the story was published, the Defence Secretary, William Cohen, ordered the army's inspector-general to conduct an investigation, for which Daily has been interviewed at length. If the commission appointed by the Pentagon concludes that the soldiers were given orders to fire, that could mean a war crime had been committed.</p> <p>The State Department is also concerned that US-Korean relations could suffer.</p> <p>AP's story was narrated principally by four US soldiers - Daily, Delos Flint, Eugene Hasselman and Herman Patterson - who claimed they were witnesses to and participants in the carnage, and are now haunted by remorse.</p> <p>The first doubts over the veracity of the story came from a veterans' website, stripes.com. Then came an instructor at West Point Marine Academy, Major Robert Bateman, who said he could see 'big problems' with the witnesses' accounts, especially that of Daily, whom he labelled 'the biggest fake combat veteran extant' for whom 'the AP team fell'.</p> <p>Two servicemen involved gave interviews to US News and World Report and one, Patterson, said a quote about 'wholesale slaughter' had been taken out of context by AP.

      "bodyText": "Behind the glorious Art Deco fa\u00e7ade of its New York headquarters, one of the mainmasts of the world's media, Associated Press, is scrambling to salvage its credibility. Its most remarkable story of recent times has been thrown into doubt. The central and most compelling witness to AP's story of a shocking massacre by American forces has turned out to be a fake. AP and an investigative reporting team was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for unveiling the massacre of hundreds of Korean citizens - many of them women and children - by US troops on and around a bridge at No Gun Ri in July 1950. It was an atrocity second only to the Vietnam's My Lai massacre in America's book of shame. The story detonated consternation, soul-searching and praise. Last year it was splashed over every daily newspaper from the tabloids to the New York Times. Tom Brokaw, the superstar anchorman of Nightline, flew to Korea with Edward Daily, the GI who so vividly confessed his part in the carnage, for a tearful reunion with survivors. Daily became an overnight celebrity, embodying both the atrocity and the healing - survivors were in turn flown over to emotional prayer meetings in the US, 'reunited' with and hugging Daily. But after weeks of investigation, argument and counter-argument, AP has been forced into admitting that Daily could not have been at No Gun Ri. Further inquiries by The Observer show that even before the story was released, it was the subject of bitter argument at AP, with the president of the company himself unsure of its veracity. A military academic has condemned Daily's dazzling military career as fantastical. Daily's fabrication of his service record has him captured by the communist North Koreans, decorated for heroic antics and rescuing his platoon comrades under enemy fire. In fact, he was a mechanic in a lacklustre rear-echelon battalion. Daily was last week forced into admitting that he 'cannot dispute' the discovery that he is a fake, and has confessed to having gleaned his account from obsessive conversations at veterans' reunions. His hoax has ramifications beyond AP: at issue is not whether the massacre happened - which the Pentagon has all but confirmed - but whether the troops obeyed an order by firing, or acted on the spur of the moment. According to AP, there was an order: 'No refugees to cross frontline. Fire everyone trying to cross frontlines. Use discretion in case of women and children.' Daily had told AP: 'The command looked at it as getting rid of the problem the easiest way. That was to shoot them in a group.' As soon as the story was published, the Defence Secretary, William Cohen, ordered the army's inspector-general to conduct an investigation, for which Daily has been interviewed at length. If the commission appointed by the Pentagon concludes that the soldiers were given orders to fire, that could mean a war crime had been committed. The State Department is also concerned that US-Korean relations could suffer. AP's story was narrated principally by four US soldiers - Daily, Delos Flint, Eugene Hasselman and Herman Patterson - who claimed they were witnesses to and participants in the carnage, and are now haunted by remorse. The first doubts over the veracity of the story came from a veterans' website, stripes.com. Then came an instructor at West Point Marine Academy, Major Robert Bateman, who said he could see 'big problems' with the witnesses' accounts, especially that of Daily, whom he labelled 'the biggest fake combat veteran extant' for whom 'the AP team fell'. Two servicemen involved gave interviews to US News and World Report and one, Patterson, said a quote about 'wholesale slaughter' had been taken out of context by AP. Moreover, said the magazine, documents showed Flint had been evacuated wounded from the area the day before the massacre, on 26 July. The magazine added that, although Daily repeats in his interview that 'my memory is that I was there at No Gun Ri', his service records showed him to have joined H Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, eight months after the massacre, and not to have been a machine gunner, as he had claimed to AP. The AP empire then struck back, releasing full transcripts from the two men interviewed by US News , showing that they had not been quoted out of context. In a separate report, the agency said other GIs recalled seeing Daily at the scene that day. Hasselman not only insists that he was there, but that he recalls Daily being there too. There was also a further document to counter the crit ical argument that Flint had been evacuated from the zone - a 'morning report' showing that he had been wounded on the day of the massacre. The next day, the US News executive editor Brian Duffy was forced to concede that 'we should have cited the morning report that said he was wounded on the 26th, and on our part that was an oversight'. But now comes the definitive blow, from Bateman at West Point. He shows conclusively that Daily is not only lying, but has gone to great lengths to invent his records. Sources investigating the case say the veteran falsified a letter saying that he had been taken prisoner of war, and that the numerous decorations and commendations with which he impressed AP reporters were also false. Subsequent inquiries show that Daily also acted as a pointman for AP, putting them in touch with his contacts on the veterans' network, mainly people he had met, pretended to know of old, and whose stories he had adopted as his own.",

      "bodyText": "The Queen's Birthday Honours List next weekend will have some notable omissions from the southern hemisphere. New Zealand has joined Australia in abolishing titular state honours. The first effects will be seen when the Birthday List contains no new Kiwi knights or dames. The titles already bestowed on mountaineer Edmund Hillary, opera singer Kiri Te Kanawa and other New Zealanders are safe, but in future their ennobled ranks will be swelled only by personal honours from the Queen. The reform is part of a modernisation programme by the Labour government, headed by Prime Minister Helen Clark, who won power six months ago. A review is under way to assess whether the country should also sever its 150-year-old link with the Privy Council in London. Clark questions the worth to her country of a final appeal court 12,000 miles away. Her predecessor, the National Party leader Jenny Shipley, said the honours were worth keeping. Clark, however, said a new honours system, approved by the Queen, has come not a moment too soon. 'Knight and damehoods overshadow not only our highest honour, the Order of New Zealand, but also a large number of other awards given for an extraordinary variety of services to a wide cross-section of the community,' Clark said. 'Our own developing traditions, the strengthening of our own cultural and national identity and the argument for New Zealanders to be honoured in a distinctive New Zealand way, tipped the scales against titular honours in New Zealand's own orders'. The Order of the British Empire has also been scrapped for native New Zealanders in favour of the indigenous awards, which include the Order of New Zealand, an Order of Merit and gallantry awards. More than half the population wanted the change, an opinion poll shows. Among the dissenters was the vice-chairman of the Monarchist League, Noel Cox, who labelled the Prime Minister 'Comrade Clark' over the scheme. Cox believes New Zealand honours without titles lack the impact and international recognition of knighthoods. However, Canada, Australia and most other countries in the Commonwealth no longer award titles with honours. In Australia, Bob Hawke's Labour administration finally ended titular honours in the Eighties. Clark said: 'Australia, a country noted for backing its heroes and heroines, has managed without knighthoods. There are distinguished New Zealanders who have not received high honours because they were not prepared to accept a title. The new system will be much more inclusive.'",

Governor Jim Hodges last week endorsed the Bill with both his signature and relief that 'we will no longer be the only state with the flag on our dome'.</p> <p>The flag-lowering will probably be a tumultuous scene, as protesters and the odd Ku Klux Klansman face off against jubilant Confeder ate flag-burning crowds. The notion of a national flag is of special significance to Americans in a way that the British find hard to understand.

      "bodyText": "At noon on 1 July, the Confederate battle flag will be lowered from its pole atop the dome of the state capitol in Columbia, South Carolina, thereby closing a bitter war that for decades has cut deep and painfully at old wounds in the New South. 'Thank you, Jesus, thank you,' roared a (white) Democratic senator as the vote to bring down the 'Stars and Bars' was passed, reflecting the shredded emotions and sheer fatigue that have characterised the most highly charged symbolic battle in America. Governor Jim Hodges last week endorsed the Bill with both his signature and relief that 'we will no longer be the only state with the flag on our dome'. The flag-lowering will probably be a tumultuous scene, as protesters and the odd Ku Klux Klansman face off against jubilant Confeder ate flag-burning crowds. The notion of a national flag is of special significance to Americans in a way that the British find hard to understand. The Stars and Stripes, ubiquitously flown, is more than an emblem, it is what unifies the country, it is America's fragile essence, claimed across all political and ideological barriers as a metaphor for the land itself. And the Confederate flag means all these things to many whites in the South. They insist the flag is a nostalgic symbol not of racism but of 'heritage', a lost world of grace and wealth laid waste by the barbarians of the industrial North. In this camp, there is a blindness (or rather a pretence at blindness) to what the flag means to its opponents: the real barbarism of slavery. A Confederate flag on a car bumper in the South is intended to strike terror into the heart of a black person, and does so. Atop a government building, it is an act of brazen humiliation. To one side it means glory, to the other it means enslavement. It is a fundamental divide across America's deepest wound, the Civil War. The flag's removal next month is itself a powerful sym bol of reckoning - of the Old South making way for the New - coinciding as it does with the conviction last week of two Klansmen for firebombing a black church in 1963, and with a host of other racist murder and lynching cases reopened and being tried. And it dovetails into mounting pressure for the passage of a Congressional Bill setting up a commission to draft a system of reparations to be paid in compensation for slavery. The South Carolina legislature also voted to observe Martin Luther King Day - the last state to do so - having rejected the idea as recently as March. And ground was broken in front of the state house for a monument celebrating black American history. One of the iconic figures in the campaign to have the flag removed was Tom Turnipseed, who three decades ago was national director of George Wallace's 'Segregation Forever' campaign and whose grandfather was a Wizard in the KKK. Turnipseed is now a card-carrying member of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and was a co-plaintiff in a case taken by the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Centre against the Klan in South Carolina over the burning of a black church, which resulted in a damages award of $37 million against the KKK and brought about its near-destruction in the state. Turnipseed's conversion is seen by the black lobby as tantamount to seeing the light. 'That Dixie symbol is a-comin' down,' he says now, 'we're gonna take it down.' But the removal of the Stars and Bars from the dome is not an outright defeat for the flag's supporters.

      "body": "<p>John Adams is the most inventive and ebullient of contemporary American composers, and the most widely performed. Outgrowing the hypnotic drone of minimalism, he has taken on the classical tradition and annexed its august forms; his opera Nixon in China, first performed in Texas in 1987, has its English stage premiere at ENO on Wednesday as a certified classic. The man himself, a spry, greying elf now aged 53, restores to music its ancient, sacred functions - making audible the orderly structure of the universe in his symphonic treatise Harmonielehre, assuaging human pain in his Whitman setting The Wound-Dresser. </p> <p>Imagine my surprise, therefore, when Adams - at breakfast last weekend in Vancouver, where he is conducting at a festival of new music - ordered the music in the restaurant turned off. Or rather it was Muzak, as viscous as maple syrup, which he asked to have unplugged. 'I'm being a crank this morning,' he said. John Cage, his early hero, thought that the street noise outside his Manhattan window was musical; the ears of Adams himself are stricter. </p> <p>'I hate Muzak,' he said, repeating his request. Then he scanned the menu. 'I'll have a rattlesnake steak and a blueberry shake,' he decided. Neither item was on offer: he just enjoys making words rhyme. For Nixon in China, he insisted on a libretto in heroic couplets. 'I can't set prose to music. It's too - well, prosaic.' By now he was negotiating with the addled waitress. 'Grapefruit juice and pancakes. No sausage, I don't eat meat.' </p> <p>Adams lives in Berkeley, across the bay from San Francisco: intestinal purity is a compulsory creed, along with air purged of cigarette fumes and Mantovani tunes. </p> <p>The night before, I'd heard him conduct his recent symphony, Naive and Sentimental Music. The title derives from Schiller's contrast between poets who are instinctive and those who are self-conscious; a bumptious little tune sets out on the road, and gets its heart broken by some Mahlerian cataclysms. 'I always liked that essay of Schiller's, more than Goethe's opposition between classical and romantic or Nietzche's Apollonian versus Dionysian. I thought it summed up my personality.' That personality, as Adams has often said, is schizoid. He can be moody, introspective and lyrical, and also - as in what he calls 'the overgrown boogie-woogie' of Fearful Symmetries - prone to uproarious misbehaviour. He calls this side of himself 'the trickster'. 'I'm like a coyote,' he said. 'They're shrewd, they can outwit their hunters.' </p> <p>His Chamber Symphony combines the atonal knottiness of Schoenberg with the crass mayhem of Roadrunner cartoons. Nixon in China ends elegiacally, after a raucous chorus celebrating prize pigs and a parodic skit about the beleaguered peasantry. </p> <p>Goethe, Nietzsche and Schiller were all proposing choices, whereas Adams contrives to be both naive and sentimental. 'I want both,' he admitted, 'I want it all. Isn't that typically American? How can you avoid being jingoistic, when you have my name?' He is indeed an American version of Adam, the discoverer and sole proprietor of new aural worlds. 'My works,' he said 'aren't a dialectic of opposites, like classical sonata form. I send the air through large sonic structures, I take big blocks of sound and I kind of strum them. As you listen, you move through a landscape or a terrain' - a pristine Eden in El Dorado, the wind sculpted bluffs and buttes of the Nevada desert in Hoodoo Zephyr. </p> <p>In 1971, Adams dramatised his quest for a personal paradise by uprooting himself from New England and driving to San Francisco. 'I was disgusted with the East Coast. At Harvard, music went from Gregorian chant to Webern - no jazz, nothing vernacular. It took a considerable act of will to reject what I'd been taught, and I knew no one out West. For a while, I worked on the waterfront in Oakland. I was a real settler on the frontier.' </p> <p>Nixon in China, about American innocents abroad in the wiliest and most cynically elderly of cultures, voices Adams's gratitude to his adopted state. 'Oh, California!' sighs the homesick Pat Nixon during a bilious Peking banquet. Her aria, 'This is prophetic!', is a benediction of her own country and Nixon himself ingenuously declares 'America is good at heart'. Adams rejects descriptions of the work as pop art, as if Mao were like Andy Warhol - a bright, bland visage, not a compound of a poet, philosopher, mass murderer and profligate womaniser. 'I wanted to get beyond irony and disgust, which were Warhol's reactions. This country is so caught up in its own mythology - no, sorry, I mean that country: I forgot we're in Canada! Every day the national symbols of the United States are abused by the media. They use the Statue of Liberty to sell tampons or the Grand Canyon to flog Land Cruisers. I wanted to take these grand beliefs of ours back from the advertisers who've perverted them.' </p> <p>Hence the lofty idealism and sad nostalgia of Adams's Nixon. 'At the time, he was Tricky Dick, a butt for comedians in night clubs. I despised him as a politician, but in the opera he's a presidential Everyman. I don't care what he thought of the piece. I treated him as Shakespeare did Henry IV or Julius Caesar: he was an archetype. Who cares that Pat never said anything in real life? In the opera, she sings; she becomes what Jung calls the anima.' </p> <p>Nixon, arriving in Peking, excitedly announces that his visit to Mao is being studied by 'the eyes and ears of history'. Adams shares this sense of mission. The opera was planned as an addition to the ancestry of the form, as if updating Handel's Julius Caesar in Egypt. The score quotes from Wagner and Madame Mao (for Adams China's Robespierre) mimics the witchy coloratura tirades of Mozart's Queen of the Night in The Magic Flute. ' I wrote it to inaugurate a new opera house in Houston; the other work they did for the opening was Aida. Well, Nixon has its own triumph scene, when the 747 lands on stage. And both operas have elephants in them!' </p> <p>It's native bravado, not arrogance, which makes Adams measure himself against Verdi or compare his own dramaturgy with Shakespeare's. As he said when describing the way his Chamber Symphony teases Schoenberg, 'I deal with him as an American: I stick my tongue out, and wag my ears.' Despite the impertinent pluck which he shares with coyotes and the unkillable Roadrunner, the Nixon commission brought with it a crushing burden of expectation: he felt as if he were 'pregnant with the royal heir'. If the Adams who composed Nixon was Princess Diana, charged with perpetuating the dynastic line, then his current labour is even more momentous. For his next act, he is impersonating the Virgin Mary. In December, as a commemoration of the millennium, he will bring forth a child who was conceived immaculately. The Chatelet in Paris asked him for a new opera, but he offered instead an oratorio. 'It's about Nativity. It will be,' he said with supreme self-possession, 'my Messiah'. </p> <p>I wondered about his credentials. 'I'm a lapsed Christian. I started out Episcopalian, then my mother switched to Unitarianism. That's a very Yankee religion, without crosses, sceptical about everything.' </p> <p>So how can a sceptic portray the virgin birth? 'Well, I could have decided that Jesus was a natural-born child who grew up to be Mahatma Gandhi. But I think it has to be a miracle and I have my own Byzantine way of rationalising that. The divine conception amplifies what's already a miracle. When my daughter was born, suddenly there weren't five people in the delivery room, there were six! You can talk all you like about sperms, eggs, cell division and zygotes; that doesn't explain it.' </p> <p>The new work was initially entitled How Did This Happen? The query, Adams noted, is not a quote from some unbelieving CNN correspondent in Bethlehem; it translates a Latin phrase in the Christmas antiphon. Nevertheless, he has just changed the oratorio's name. It will now be called El Ni\u00f1o. He told me this as we were walking through the Vancouver streets in driving rain. Wasn't El Ni\u00f1o, I asked, the demonic infant cradled in Pacific troughs, who might be dumping all this water on us? 'No, no,' he said. 'This is La Ni\u00f1a, she's his younger sister!\" Off he waded beneath his umbrella to keep his appointment with destiny. </p> <p>Before we parted, he had a request. As aware of his public identity and his place in history as the politicians in Nixon, he said: 'I hope you won't mention that I asked to have that Muzak turned off? I wouldn't want to look like a snob.' </p> <p>A trickster myself, I shook his soggy hand and gave him my solemn promise. Coyotes may be cunning, but so are dingoes. </p> <p> Nixon in China opens at the Coliseum, London (020 7632 8300), on Wednesday and runs in repertory until 21 June</p>",

Who says opera doesn't inhabit the real world? It's not easy to find the name of Mischa Spoliansky in a dictionary of music. A minor Russian-German composer, he flourished in Berlin until Hitler came to power, when he escaped to London, wrote anti-Nazi music and the scores for nearly four dozen films.

The festival's director, Kenneth Richardson, provided a witty new translation which was conspicuously faithful to the music. The setting is a department store where the customers always complain and are always right. A scapegoat must be found.

Lillian Watson rages in a parodying coloratura aria in which, as a wealthy shopaholic, she maps out her purchasing world: Brussels for chocs, Switzerland for socks and for a pin, only Berlin will do. She finds the pin but the shop refuses to deliver it to the car. It's all silly, frothy and fun. Well cast and smartly, if a little smoothly, played by the BBC Concert Orchestra conducted by Robert Ziegler, this was a thoroughly engaging 45 minutes. </p> <p>Marie McLaughlin, with dancer Maxine Fone, completed the double-bill with a strong account of Weill's Seven Deadly Sins.

Set in an African jungle, it features a United Nations-funded music camp now being investigated by a UN envoy. All the oddball musicians who have enjoyed its patronage for years now have to account for themselves, with bizarre results. This concoction of ingredients, from the frustrated wife who obsessively practises Mozart to the indolent, alcoholic slide trombonist, gives Panufnik scope for jungle sounds, African and jazz rhythms and classical pastiche. The Linbury Studio acoustic does not help the singing voice when it comes to hearing words, and made this episodic work confusing to follow but the Teatr Wielki-Polish National Opera per formed with commitment. </p> <p>The rain must have helped BBC Music Live win a bigger audience than it deserved.

Why, they asked, was it not in the original language with subtitles then at least they'd have grasped what was going on. Now we know what the Doming down of music is like, give me Top of the Pops any day. What a ghastly BBC muddle. Roll on the Proms.",

      "body": "<p>When I was 12, I remember discussing with my sister, Holly, and our closest friends our prospects for the year 2000. We would be 32 by then, decrepit Sevenoaks housewives with several children, incapable of having fun. The prospect didn't distress us; we just accepted it as our destiny.</p> <p>Twenty years have flown past and our expectations have been splendidly confounded - we still have fun and none of us lives in Sevenoaks. However, of the nine of us, five are married, an unusually high proportion by today's standards. Holly got married a month ago and as I undertook the exacting task of organising her hen night it occurred to me that, just as Christmas is the one reliable date when you'll see your entire family, hen nights are the only time when a group of frantically busy women are guaranteed a proper reunion.</p> <p>These reunions have become such a ritual that they should no longer be hostages to fortune and a bobby-dazzler from Tiffany's. Any of our circle should be able to claim her hen night as a rite of passage and a chance to reflect that girls are a girl's best friend.</p> <p>The five hen nights my group of friends have already celebrated span eight years and cover an age gap of 10 years - the first of us to get married was 24 at the time, while my sister is now 34. Each event was rigorously recorded for posterity and as I sift through the stills I realise that I am looking at a photo-essay that charts the evolution of working women over the Nineties, that peculiarly feminine decade which saw the rapid rise of women in the workplace and the near eradication of old, male-dominated industries.</p> <p>The professional lives of the women in our group reflect those changes; only two, both doctors, work in the public sector; five of us work in the booming service and communication industries (an accountant, a marketing executive, two journalists and a photographer); one is a full-time mother; the last is a single parent, eco-warrior and tree-hugger who works part-time as a Yoga teacher, a drama teacher to small children and a carer in an old people's home. We couldn't be more representative of professions and concerns that are increasingly colonised by women.</p> <p>Hen nights, in themselves, helped define the new order. They don't even exist if you go back beyond the Eighties. There may have been all-girl parties evolved from the American tradition of a 'bridal shower', but these were sedate affairs. Women, went the thinking, embraced marriage without a backward glance. Marriage, for women, was a vocation. Men, on the other hand, had stag parties because they were abandoning the carefree life of the bachelor and so were entitled to one last fling.</p> <p>Feminism changed all that. The hen night was a natural spin-off of the sisters' more landmark victories: if women were entitled to equal opportunities in the workplace, then they were bloody well entitled to a drunken night out with their mates and some spirited entertainment from a stripper.</p> <p>The evolution of my school friends away from potential recruits to the gin and Volvo brigade of Sevenoaks housewifery was gradual. When I look at photos of our 24-year-old selves, I can scratch the surface and see the laddered Lycra of just relinquished student days. Bee and Rachael are still at St Bart's, not quite through their final medical examinations; Olly is on a BBC trainees' course; Polly and Holly have just been to Russia on some sort of ecologically-sound exchange scheme; Sally and Lizzie have a toehold on the corporate rung, and I'm about to be sacked from my job as editor's PA at GQ .</p> <p>The bride-to-be, Sarah, is as keen as mustard to get banged up and start painting nurseries. Giving up her job is no problem - her fianc\u00e9 is easily able to keep a roof over her head. So far, so traditional. I catch Sarah's bouquet, and when I get married, two years later, it will be a similar story. My income is negligible and my career prospects poor, my spouse-to-be older than me and tolerant. Mostly, I sit on the sofa at home, eating chocolates and reading novels. But the seeds of change are in the air: Sally and Lizzie already have new company cars (a swanky BMW in Sally's case). And when I'm ill on my hen weekend, the medics are now qualified enough to tell me blithely that I mustn't worry about combining antibiotics with alcohol - they never do.</p> <p>These two first hen weekends, in the early Nineties, reveal us as worthy precursors of the ladette brigade. Both take place in Brighton, with the seediest hotels we can possibly find as our bases, packed in four to a room. Both entail a group of about 18 women tracking down every karaoke bar, every disco (and we mean D.I.S.C.O), and passable-looking straight man over the age of consent. Both share the adornment of a male stripper, in fact, the very same stripper. Mikey (a dental technician by day) is so good that he is called out of retirement for my hen weekend. One of the reasons Mikey is good is that he never leaves and is not averse to couching down, in time-honoured fashion, with one of the hens.</p> <p>On Sarah's hen weekend, the task of finding straight men who aren't strippers is made easier when we discover we are sharing our hotel with an entire stag party. Within 24 hours, the groom has proposed to Sarah's cousin and she has slapped him for his perfidy. Despite this perky interchange, we are struck by how dull stag nights are compared to the frolics enjoyed by hens. The average stag night consists of drinking, a stripper, more drinking. And that's it. (My husband found the prospect of a stag night so unappealing that he stayed at home and watched The Right Stuff instead.)</p> <p>The male bondng thing is rubbish - men who don't know one another are unlikely to return from a stag party as mates, but women often make new bosom friends on a hen night. On the hen nights I've been on, we've variously told ghost stories, re-enacted the scene of espousal, with sound effects, played sardines and lain on the beach and done a Mexican wave of air-inflated stomachs. When these things pall, there's always that inexhaustible topic of conversation: sex. About 80 per cent of my sexual knowledge comes from hen-party conversations.</p> <p>By the time Bee gets married, in 1998, things have evolved again. She is marrying a fellow doctor and they're pretty much on an equal footing. Her hen night is more sophisticated than Sarah's and mine. It's a night out in London, starting at a cocktail bar, moving on to a chic Soho restaurant and then to Car Wash, the Seventies disco. The 16 or so women could be described as young, urban professionals. Even the sex aids we lavish upon Bee are expensive, de luxe models. The mood is spendthrift and reckless. Sarah is the only mother, one boy and a girl on the way; the rest have put it on hold. Sally and Lizzie have whizzy new jobs and I have become editor of an obscure erotic journal. The pace is fast, there's a whiff of excess in the air and our livers are becoming frailer. The two-day hangover has become a harsh reality.</p> <p>By the winter of 1999, a month before Sally's wedding (to my little brother), there is a noticeable shift. The more ambitious members of our group of nine are becoming mellower. We're in our thirties and the disco, stripper, thing is less appealing. It's hardly a body-blow when we receive an invitation for a weekend in a Cotswold farmhouse. In fact, it's what we feel like. There's a spot of karaoke for old time's sake, but the real highlights are a long walk and the group cooking sessions. Clearly, we're getting old.</p> <p>Sarah lies in bed, heavily pregnant, and you can feel the hormonal surge as we lay hands on her bulging stomach. When you look outside the house, there's a whole row of gleaming cars. Lizzie has a sporty little Puma, Sally a Golf GTI, while Sarah has a vast, new Jeep thing. And these cars normally live outside equally desirable residences. My friends have become women of property. When Hereward marries Sally, he will marry a cottage in Kent and a professional older woman, a couple of years his senior, who earns 'considerably more' than he does.</p> <p>And the trend continues. Holly also marries a strapping younger man who is not, as yet, in the same income bracket. And when I organise her hen night, the invitees included a cluster of women in their mid-thirties who are dropping babies left, right and centre. It is clear that we're into a whole new ball game. Money is less of an object; comfort, and the chance of a long night's sleep, is at a premium. What we need is a house that's both large enough to house 16 women, several of whom are heavily pregnant, and is hospitable terrain to a smattering of infants.</p> <p>We are talking grand luxe: we want sofas, Agas and blazing log fires. Luckily, Rural Retreats (an agency that lets country houses equipped to the standard of country-house hotels) comes up trumps with Bruisyard Hall, a spectacular manor house in Suffolk which, appropriately enough, had once been a nunnery. Whereas once we pined for all-night raves and cheap thrills, now we pine for a weekend of lie-ins and girl talk. The tatty glamour of Brighton gives way to the dappled bricks, deer forest and sunlit meadows of Bruisyard. And there are no regrets.</p> <p>Well, not many. Personally, I always think it's a shame if a woman waves goodbye to her single status without a final, good, hard stare at the gonads of some naked man who is not her husband. So, it is fortunate that two stray travellers, dressed only in highwayman's robes, masks and tricorn hats, should stray to that part of remote Suffolk and hammer on the door of Bruisyard Hall around midnight on the day of our grand hen banquet, and fortunate indeed that it's the bride-to-be who opens the door just as they carelessly expose their nether quarters to the elements. I suppose there are some things you just never grow out of.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Battlefield Earth</strong> (117 mins, PG) Directed by Roger Christian; starring John Travolta, Forest Whitaker </p> <p><strong> The Ninth Gate</strong> (133 mins, 15) Directed by Roman Polanski; starring Johnny Depp, Emmanuelle Seigner </p> <p><strong> Maybe Baby</strong> (104 mins, 15) Directed by Ben Elton; starring Hugh Laurie, Joely Richardson </p> <p><strong> Broken Vessels</strong> (91 mins, 18) Directed by Scott Ziehl; starring Todd Field, Jason London </p> <p><strong> Mal</strong> (85 mins, 18) Directed by Alberto Seixas Santos; starring Sofia Aparico, Pauline Cadell </p> <p><strong> The King of Paris</strong> (102 mins, 12) Directed Dominique Maillet; starring Philipe Noiret </p> <p><strong> Wisconsin Death Trip</strong> (76 mins) Directed by James Marsh </p> <p><strong> Shergar</strong> (91mins, PG) Directed by Denis Lewiston; starring Ian Holm </p> <p>The rest of the week is, essentially, a tale of three tragedies. Tragedy One, already a legendary Lear among turkeys, is <strong> Battlefield Earth</strong>, in which a few residual hairy human morons (circa AD3000) confront a race of hairy alien morons called Psychlos whose lust for gold doesn't extend to knowing about Fort Knox. John Travolta, plastically padded, plays the arch villain with an accent that rambles between Alan Rickman and No\u00ebl Coward. Forest Whitaker is his terminally stupid sidekick, Barry Pepper (from The Green Mile) the pig-tailed blond bombshell who saves our world. These are arguably fine actors. But nothing, of course, can save this enterprise. </p> <p>L. Ron Hubbard, the father of scientology, wrote the original novel 20 years ago and Travolta, a loyal follower of L. Ron, has been dreaming of producing and starring in it for more than a decade. That's probably the real tragedy. The director, Roger Christian, won an Oscar for his Star Wars sets, but here his most relevant previous form seems to be Taco Bell commercials. </p> <p>The computer special effects are by early Amstrad and the plot is a hirsute mystery. What was it supposed to be? Independence Day without the laughs? The Empire Strikes Out? The most desultory fact, as turkeys go, is that it isn't even a decent giggle. It doesn't, and you don't, have a clue. The wreck of reputation and judgment is absolute. </p> <p><strong> The Ninth Gate</strong> offers more poignant sorrow and pity in the guise of Tragedy Two. Roman Polanski directed some of the twentieth-century's most memorable movies - masterpieces such as Chinatown, precise terrors such as Rosemary's Baby. Where, through the barren Eighties and Nineties, has that talent gone? It lives here in the understated beginnings of this occult thriller as Johnny Depp's book-dealer hero is hired to track down the only three copies of an ancient satanic text which, properly pieced together, can summon Lucifer, but then, suddenly, everything goes to hell. </p> <p>Barbara Jefford, as a bizarre German countess, is handed five minutes of unspeakable dialogue and immolated; Mrs Polanski (Emmanuelle Seigner, a very mature student) turns into a mix of Batgirl and Emma Peel; Frank Langella's evil genius sounds like the director-general of the CBI. The end is neither frightening nor funny, pure Eurotosh. No wonder Depp, toiling quietly away, looks dazed and confused. </p> <p>But perhaps Tragedy Three, the direst of the lot, is <strong> Maybe Baby</strong> . Ben Elton can do anything, right? Tell stand-up jokes, churn out sitcoms, pen hit plays and bestselling books. Is there anything he can't do? The answer, alas, is that he can't write and direct a 'romantic comedy' about IVF (based on his own trueish-to-personal-life novel) in which a BBC producer in an infertile marriage turns author of a play about being a BBC producer in an infertile marriage. Pirandello times three. Even Fellini would have passed on that. The original Maybe Baby was just about tolerable because the novelist in Elton could talk directly to the reader and the embarrassments were private ones. Open the notion out on a big screen, though, dot it with crudely funny bits from Rowan Atkinson and Dawn French and endless shagging dog stories ('lay lines' and the rest), and romance dies with a cringe. </p> <p>Joely Richardson's harassed wife looks sweetly stalwart in satin knickers with her legs in the air; Hugh Laurie's hubby bids for the sympathy vote. Elton merely points his camera at them and hopes for the best. Can you make a comedy about sperm counts and desperation? Probably. You can make a comedy about anything if you leave the humanity in. Here, though, the slapstick and the sniggers emerge so randomly as to appear merely callous. There's no self-awareness, no sense of discipline. The Lottery, for once, isn't to blame. This is a BBC production, so you paid directly, but no man from Auntie rode shotgun against the crassness. A tragedy of the ego. </p> <p>The word on the (Wardour) street, meanwhile, is suitably downbeat. Don't expect much box-office cheer for the next few weeks. June is for football, not films - prime time to clear your distribution bottom drawer of stuff with no sell-by date. That means the terrible clinkers: but it also means a few interesting sales bargains. <strong> Broken Vessels</strong> (from 1998) is one such and Scott Ziehl, its director, is a talent to watch. </p> <p>Fresh-faced Jason London, an innocent with a guilty secret, arrives in Los Angeles and lands a job as a privatised ambulance man alongside the entirely non-innocent Todd Field, who wants to be a cop, not a paramedic. He seems to have most of the relevant LA qualifications for that ambition: booze and drugs on the job, thievings to feed his habits. London is soon on the Faustian road to ruin and the two of them spiral towards hell in a welter of bloody accidents, dementia and deceptions. Grim? Of course. This is the Scorsese world of Bringing out the Dead and the strain is unrelenting. You can feel the nerve ends tear. But Ziehl has a gift for raw action and, better still, a pungent wit. The scene where London's camp flatmate leaves him in charge of his cherished goldfish for the weekend and our hung-over hero pukes in the tank is high comedy. Field provides a riveting study in moral disintegration; London congeals in a yellowed sweat of depravity. It all gets a little formulaic in the end, lost among druggy lurchings, yet the energy is compulsive. </p> <p>Alberto Seixas Santos's <strong> Mal</strong> (or Evil), by coincidence, is really the LA of Magnolia translated to Lisbon. A middle-aged Irish woman (Pauline Cadell) is tortured by the infidelities of her infernally handsome lawyer husband (Rui Morrison); an old man from the country hunts for his runaway granddaughter; street kids rob and murder. And gradually the disparate tales are woven together into a human definition of the film's title. </p> <p>What's good is the acting (from Cadell and Morrison especially, locked in a self-destructive passion they can't escape) and the detailed observation of a seedy, unfamiliar city. Seixas Santos draws his stories from the rhythms of ordinary life. What isn't so successful is a finale which swings almost apologetically into grand symbolism and is over in a trice. You wish it had rained frogs instead. </p> <p>There are no such taxing moments to <strong> The King of Paris</strong>, trundling out an inexplicable five years after its French release - a theatrical piece in every sense. Philippe Noiret is Derval, the big star actor of the early Thirties, Wolfit bitten by bloodhound. He meets an ambitious Hungarian girl by the Seine, beds her and gives her a job. His son falls for her, too, so there's more tragedy and rivalry and hatred as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e (Veronika Varga) turns actress and outstrips her mentor. </p> <p>It's a solid piece, full of velvet plush fit for a West End matin\u00e9e and familiar Gallic faces grimacing to order.

Tragedy One, already a legendary Lear among turkeys, is Battlefield Earth, in which a few residual hairy human morons (circa AD3000) confront a race of hairy alien morons called Psychlos whose lust for gold doesn't extend to knowing about Fort Knox. John Travolta, plastically padded, plays the arch villain with an accent that rambles between Alan Rickman and No\u00ebl Coward. Forest Whitaker is his terminally stupid sidekick, Barry Pepper (from The Green Mile) the pig-tailed blond bombshell who saves our world. These are arguably fine actors. But nothing, of course, can save this enterprise. L. Ron Hubbard, the father of scientology, wrote the original novel 20 years ago and Travolta, a loyal follower of L. Ron, has been dreaming of producing and starring in it for more than a decade. That's probably the real tragedy. The director, Roger Christian, won an Oscar for his Star Wars sets, but here his most relevant previous form seems to be Taco Bell commercials. The computer special effects are by early Amstrad and the plot is a hirsute mystery. What was it supposed to be? Independence Day without the laughs? The Empire Strikes Out? The most desultory fact, as turkeys go, is that it isn't even a decent giggle. It doesn't, and you don't, have a clue. The wreck of reputation and judgment is absolute. The Ninth Gate offers more poignant sorrow and pity in the guise of Tragedy Two. Roman Polanski directed some of the twentieth-century's most memorable movies - masterpieces such as Chinatown, precise terrors such as Rosemary's Baby. Where, through the barren Eighties and Nineties, has that talent gone? It lives here in the understated beginnings of this occult thriller as Johnny Depp's book-dealer hero is hired to track down the only three copies of an ancient satanic text which, properly pieced together, can summon Lucifer, but then, suddenly, everything goes to hell. Barbara Jefford, as a bizarre German countess, is handed five minutes of unspeakable dialogue and immolated; Mrs Polanski (Emmanuelle Seigner, a very mature student) turns into a mix of Batgirl and Emma Peel; Frank Langella's evil genius sounds like the director-general of the CBI. The end is neither frightening nor funny, pure Eurotosh. No wonder Depp, toiling quietly away, looks dazed and confused. But perhaps Tragedy Three, the direst of the lot, is Maybe Baby . Ben Elton can do anything, right? Tell stand-up jokes, churn out sitcoms, pen hit plays and bestselling books. Is there anything he can't do? The answer, alas, is that he can't write and direct a 'romantic comedy' about IVF (based on his own trueish-to-personal-life novel) in which a BBC producer in an infertile marriage turns author of a play about being a BBC producer in an infertile marriage. Pirandello times three. Even Fellini would have passed on that. The original Maybe Baby was just about tolerable because the novelist in Elton could talk directly to the reader and the embarrassments were private ones. Open the notion out on a big screen, though, dot it with crudely funny bits from Rowan Atkinson and Dawn French and endless shagging dog stories ('lay lines' and the rest), and romance dies with a cringe. Joely Richardson's harassed wife looks sweetly stalwart in satin knickers with her legs in the air; Hugh Laurie's hubby bids for the sympathy vote. Elton merely points his camera at them and hopes for the best. Can you make a comedy about sperm counts and desperation? Probably. You can make a comedy about anything if you leave the humanity in. Here, though, the slapstick and the sniggers emerge so randomly as to appear merely callous. There's no self-awareness, no sense of discipline. The Lottery, for once, isn't to blame. This is a BBC production, so you paid directly, but no man from Auntie rode shotgun against the crassness. A tragedy of the ego. The word on the (Wardour) street, meanwhile, is suitably downbeat. Don't expect much box-office cheer for the next few weeks. June is for football, not films - prime time to clear your distribution bottom drawer of stuff with no sell-by date. That means the terrible clinkers: but it also means a few interesting sales bargains. Broken Vessels (from 1998) is one such and Scott Ziehl, its director, is a talent to watch. Fresh-faced Jason London, an innocent with a guilty secret, arrives in Los Angeles and lands a job as a privatised ambulance man alongside the entirely non-innocent Todd Field, who wants to be a cop, not a paramedic. He seems to have most of the relevant LA qualifications for that ambition: booze and drugs on the job, thievings to feed his habits. London is soon on the Faustian road to ruin and the two of them spiral towards hell in a welter of bloody accidents, dementia and deceptions. Grim? Of course. This is the Scorsese world of Bringing out the Dead and the strain is unrelenting. You can feel the nerve ends tear. But Ziehl has a gift for raw action and, better still, a pungent wit. The scene where London's camp flatmate leaves him in charge of his cherished goldfish for the weekend and our hung-over hero pukes in the tank is high comedy. Field provides a riveting study in moral disintegration; London congeals in a yellowed sweat of depravity. It all gets a little formulaic in the end, lost among druggy lurchings, yet the energy is compulsive. Alberto Seixas Santos's Mal (or Evil), by coincidence, is really the LA of Magnolia translated to Lisbon. A middle-aged Irish woman (Pauline Cadell) is tortured by the infidelities of her infernally handsome lawyer husband (Rui Morrison); an old man from the country hunts for his runaway granddaughter; street kids rob and murder. And gradually the disparate tales are woven together into a human definition of the film's title. What's good is the acting (from Cadell and Morrison especially, locked in a self-destructive passion they can't escape) and the detailed observation of a seedy, unfamiliar city. Seixas Santos draws his stories from the rhythms of ordinary life. What isn't so successful is a finale which swings almost apologetically into grand symbolism and is over in a trice. You wish it had rained frogs instead. There are no such taxing moments to The King of Paris, trundling out an inexplicable five years after its French release - a theatrical piece in every sense. Philippe Noiret is Derval, the big star actor of the early Thirties, Wolfit bitten by bloodhound. He meets an ambitious Hungarian girl by the Seine, beds her and gives her a job. His son falls for her, too, so there's more tragedy and rivalry and hatred as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e (Veronika Varga) turns actress and outstrips her mentor. It's a solid piece, full of velvet plush fit for a West End matin\u00e9e and familiar Gallic faces grimacing to order. Dominique Maillet directs competently enough; Varga looks uncannily like Helena Bonham Carter and, triumphing in The Seagull, has some of her limpid quality. But this is really a custom-built vehicle for Noiret, moving between bombast, grief and ridiculous love with relaxed certainty. Great actor plays great actor? Collectors of ripe screen performances will want this one for their album. Buy now while stocks last.

She is delighted to have escaped the City rat race and to be doing something which she really enjoys. Since last September she has been attending a foundation year course in art and design at Lewisham College and later this year she is hoping to start a three-year degree course in fine art and art history. At the same time she has been studying for a qualification in physiology, anatomy and massage and plans to study reflexology at evening classes next year. </p> <p>Her ultimate goal is to have her own business - doing some art, counselling and massage. She says she envisages herself being the feel-good person in people's lives. 'I still have many friends who work in the City who hate their jobs but they have to continue working to keep the money coming in. I really don't want to get back into that position,' Maureen says. </p> <p>In the meantime, though, she wants help to find the best way of keeping her head above water using her existing financial resources while she is studying. </p> <p>'I don't particularly want to take student loans because I know I will have to pay them back again.' By living frugally, Maureen hopes she can get by. She has calculated she needs about \u00a310,000 a year to make ends meet. Fortunately, her endowment mortgage is small and only costs her a modest \u00a3150 per month. </p> <p>Maureen's main source of money for the future is the redundancy payment of \u00a325,000 which she got from her last employer. She used it to set up a Tessa and a Pep and open an Egg account. She also has approximately 1,000 shares in Lloyds TSB from an employee share-save scheme and a similar amount in the shares of her previous employers, Close Brothers. </p> <p>Over the past year she has managed to survive on money she saved while temping after she was made redundant. She is hoping to get some more secretarial work during the summer holidays this year to boost her coffers although she feels her age often counts against her. She realises that another potential source of income is to let out a room in her three-bedroom home but she is reluctant to do this unless she has to as she likes having her own space. </p> <p>One thing she is not too worried about is her pension provision. During her working life she has accumulated several job-related pensions. One is a small pension from her first job which she had forgotten about until she recently discovered some old documents. On enquiry she found that will provide her with around \u00a3500 per year when she gets to age 60. More importantly, however, she has a pension from Hill Samuel where she worked for more than 17 years which she believes will be in the region of \u00a310,000-\u00a311,000 a year. </p> <p>Finally, she will also receive a small pension from her most recent employers, Close Brothers. </p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Gillian Cardy</strong><br>First of all, I would suggest Maureen makes full use of this year's Isa allowance to invest \u00a37,000 in a high-yield bond fund for a high, tax-free income. She may wish to consider using some shares to fund the subscription. </p> <p>Any other capital not needed for living expenses should be gradually phased into Isas in future tax years to build a fund of tax-free income. Her existing Pep could also be switched within Gartmore to a high-yield bond fund to generate income. </p> <p>In the short term, a student loan is a possibility. A more radical solution is to consider a transfer of her pensions into one personal pension plan and consider drawing the benefits now. This entails a detailed assessment of what she would be giving up at 60 in return for income now. But the reason why this might prove attractive is because most company pension schemes allow for payment of a spouse's pension. If she was to transfer the value of the pensions, this would be allowed for in the transfer value, but she would not be required to use the transfer value to buy a spouse's pension, enhancing the income. </p> <p>She could consider flexible annuity options, such as phased retirement, in effect living each year on part of the tax-free cash and part of the income from a small number of segments within the plan. She should retain her Standard Life policy as she may benefit if the demutualisation proceeds.<br>\u0095 Gillian Cardy works for financial advisers Professional Partnerships. </p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Amanda Davidson</strong><br>As to Maureen's short-term requirement for income, there is little she can do with her savings to generate the amount she requires. She cannot afford to take risks so I suggest she keeps it where it is and uses up the money in her Egg account first before she cashes in Peps and shares. However, she may like to consider transferring \u00a33,000 of her deposit savings to a mini-cash Isa so she is not taxed on any of the interest. </p> <p>She should take a student loan and put it in a deposit account. Student loans do not have to be repaid until studies end so she will benefit from interest built while she studies. </p> <p>A key area of cost saving is her mortgage. Nobody these days should have an ordinary variable rate mortgage because they are effectively subsidising the special deals offered to new borrowers. She should approach her current lender to see what special deals it has to offer. By taking a discounted or fixed-rate deal, she should be able to reduce her payments. Naturally she should hang on to her Standard Life endowment in case of a windfall. </p> <p> The pension she quotes from Hill Samuel looks quite high. She should check to ensure she will be getting what she expects. She should check her state pension, as her benefit may be affected if she fails to pay National Insurance contributions while studying.<br>\u0095 Amanda Davidson works for financial advisers Holden Meehan. </p> <p>\u0095 Advice is for guidance only.</p> <p> <strong> Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?</strong><br> Write, including daytime and evening telephone numbers, a brief list of circumstances and any investments, to: Wealthcheck, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, or e-mail:<a href=\"mailto:cash@observer.co.uk\">cash@observer.co.uk</a>.

      "body": "<p>There will be mixed royal emotions at Prince William's eighteenth birthday party on 21 June, when this last, best hope for the monarchy's long-term future, 'as earnest and dutiful as his father, as wayward and fun-loving as his mother', becomes eligible to inherit the throne in his own right. Which future king will eventually emerge from his sleek teenage chrysalis: the Windsorised Spencer, solemnly bent on his royal destiny, or the Spencerised Windsor, ready to play fast and loose with his hereditary privilege? </p> <p>Much royal breath has yet to be held, as tabloid reports of William's drug-taking chums vie for space with a long, hot summer of bad-news polls for his father, no doubt showing, as they consistently have to date, that even diehard monarchists would rather pass on King Charles III and get on with William V, offering as dramatically new, young and dynamic a face to the world as the succession from Thatcher-Major to Blair. </p> <p>It won't happen, of course. 'Out of the question!' snort courtiers. Regardless of public opinion, Britain's unwritten constitution will take its predetermined, unswerving, blithely undemocratic course. One day the Queen will die, Charles will succeed her, William will become Prince of Wales, and Britain will continue to bumble along in its quaint way as a Ruritanian theme-park of a nation, preferring a head of state chosen by accident of birth to anything as unreliable as a ballot-box. </p> <p>Once the world beyond Eton shows William what his contemporaries really think of the institution of monarchy - it is among his own age group that scornful indifference rides highest - might he develop doubts about his birthright? In the meantime, he will no doubt be glad to be spared as long as possible a job he has seen ruin his father's life and kill his mother. If an adoring nation demands his cute features on its coins and stamps instead of Charles's, however, how will he respond? Could he really be persuaded to usurp the long-awaited throne of the father he clearly adores? </p> <p>The jury, far from being out, hasn't had time to convene. But a Pandora's box has remained wide open, as Diana transparently intended when she made her own views clear in the 1995 Panorama interview which sealed her marital fate and ensured her banishment to outer royal darkness. The future king's mother wanted the 'top job' to go straight to her son, bypassing her confused, faithless husband. 'Who knows what fate will produce?' she mused darkly. 'Who knows what circumstances will provoke?' </p> <p>Like a true daughter of her own much older and more English dynasty, she also envisaged a monarch who was more Spencer than Windsor. 'Look how tall William's getting!' she used to crow to friends as her elder son shot up like a slender but sturdy stalk, past six feet in his mid-teens. 'He's much more a Spencer than a Windsor!' Almost three years since her death, Diana's boast sounds more than ever like wishful thinking. </p> <p>From the symbolic moment, only weeks later, when Prince Harry escorted his father to a Spice Girls concert in a suit and tie, rather than the regulation teenage jeans and T-shirt his mother would have encouraged, all trace of Spencer influence on Diana's sons has been ruthlessly expunged by the Windsors with the cold calculation that is their dynastic trademark (and the secret of their survival). </p> <p>Strategic statements from an ever cannier royal press office, touchingly asking for Diana to be allowed to rest in peace, have also contributed to the brutal process - the Queen's veto on commemorations of her daughter-in-law's death, Charles's complicity in her posthumous trashing by Penny Junor - which has seen the mother of William and Harry swiftly Tippexed from the royal family album. </p> <p>And thus from the national memory, to a degree surprising to those who cannot forget that remarkable first week of September 1997. At the time, when Diana's brother Charles Spencer promised the watching (and applauding) world that the 'blood family' would continue to shape William's upbringing, Britain's two noblest houses seemed set for a battle royal over the character and lifestyle of the future king, blessed with his mother's looks if not yet her populist touch. </p> <p>Then Charles Spencer's fragile halo was tarnished by his own seamy divorce, his commercialisation of his much-mourned sister's memory and the discovery that, despite his concern for William's welfare, he had no plans to move back to Britain from South Africa. His and Diana's sisters, Sarah and Jane, made a braver effort to continue the parental work she so ardently began. But now it is clear the Windsors have won an easy victory. </p> <p>Diana's true friends mist up at the thought of her missing her beloved Wills's eighteenth birthday. 'She would,' they say, 'have been so proud.' Might she also have been a tad worried? Is Charles? Is the Queen? As he formally attains manhood, William is the world's most eligible bachelor, heir to a 10-figure fortune and the most glamorous job on the planet. He's a looker, too: tall, strapping, drop-dead handsome, with a tousled crop of (natural) blond hair and Botticelli features fresh-minted from those of his mother, around whose same dazzling smile the world for a while seemed to turn. </p> <p>Even if he weren't who he is, William would turn heads and break hearts. But, given his uniquely storm-tossed life so far, and the fragile, mildly depressive psycho-profile of both his parents, it seems a miracle that he isn't a gibbering basket-case. The story of William's first 18 years has amounted to little more than that of his parents' visceral and all too public marital warfare. Before he even entered his teens, both had chosen to confess on global television to adultery, his father expressing a spooky ambition to morph into his mistress's Tampax, his mother owning up to indoor as well as outdoor riding lessons with a dashing cavalry officer. </p> <p>Their protracted public catfight was resolved only by a brutal divorce, stripping the princess of her royal rank and consigning her (as even the Daily Telegraph has put it) to the 'demi-monde', where she met her end in the arms of an Onassis-type playboy lover. </p> <p>William, say his friends, has made a remarkable recovery from the abrupt loss of his devoted (too devoted?) if somewhat unstable mother. His father is visibly relieved to have Diana out of the way, flourishing as never before since she has not been around to harass and upstage him, but William seems to have bottled up his grief and filed it in some corner cupboard of his life. One day, you sense, it must return to haunt him. 'It's amazing,' says one young chum. 'If you hang out with him - considering the shit he has gone through - even right after it happened you wouldn't notice that anything had bothered him at all.' </p> <p>Not, perhaps, altogether healthy. But William has been trained from birth to wield the stiff upper Windsor lip which supposedly symbolises the hopes and dreams of a great nation, once a mighty empire, even if, in Tony Blair's supposedly 'modernised' Britain, this seems incongruous. But in these irritatingly democratic times, when hereditary peers are kicked out of Parliament after a mere 600 years, the monarchy's best hopes of even medium-term survival rest in the box-office appeal of this seemingly pleasant young innocent, with signs of both his mother's winning ways and his father's stultifying gravitas. </p> <p>At least Diana was around long enough to leave William memo ries more down-to-earth than the young Charles was ever allowed: queueing in Marks &amp; Spencer to pay for his purchases, playing video games alongside children his own age in Piccadilly Circus, fast food at Planet Hollywood, fun days out at Thorpe Park, even sneaking under age into 18-certificate films (not to mention, of course, visiting the homeless). Weekends with Charles, meanwhile, consisted of what Diana called 'killing things' - hunting and shooting - plus tweedy charades and some racy under-age driving of Range Rovers around the royal estate amid hour upon hour of fatherless frolics with surrogate mum Tiggy Legge-Bourke. So which parent has left the stronger mark on William? </p> <p>Like Diana more than Charles, the student prince is a card-carrying fun lover who can party with the best of them. Friends joke that he lost his innocence somewhere in the Aegean last summer during his father's annual freebie cruise aboard Greek billionaire John Latsis's yacht. 'He likes women a lot,' one double-barrelled chum recently told America's Talk magazine. 'Yes, he's definitely a player.' </p> <p>Talk 's current issue mischievously pairs off the prince with a gallery of potential future Queens, from Princess Madeleine of Sweden and one Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe to Holly Branson, Elizabeth Jagger and Madonna's three-year-old daughter Lourdes (well, Diana was five when Charles turned 18). 'He's never even met Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe,' spluttered a pal. 'She'd like to meet him, though...' </p> <p>It is supposedly because of the comely 'Izzy' Winkler, a 22-year-old socialite studying philosophy at Edinburgh University, that William has set his academic sights on the Athens of the North rather than Oxbridge, like his father (and all recent male monarchs) before him. But this is a twenty-first-century prince who emails his fellow teen-star Britney Spears, admits to fancying Baby Spice and has even been seen 'snogging' the 25-year-old that mutual friends saucily refer to as his 'cousin', Emma Parker Bowles, niece of his father's long-time consort Camilla. 'Nothing much came of it,' his chum told Talk. 'But still, it's pretty good, to snog a 25-year-old when you're only 17.' </p> <p>Snogging - and much more - is high on the agenda of the gilded British youth among whom William moves: many a virginity is surrendered beneath the manicured bushes at house parties in the 'royal triangle' of rural Gloucestershire (close to his father's organic farm at Highgrove) or Norfolk (near granny's pile at Sandringham). </p> <p>Amid a fusillade of double-barrelled names, from Duckworth-Chad to Palmer-Tomkinson, horny young toffs with nicknames like Hoggins and Rollo love bandying tampon jokes while throwing bread rolls at their belles at the end of hedonistic days spent hunting, shooting, fishing, getting drunk and singing rugby songs. </p> <p>Much as he loves this world, and feels alarmingly at home in it, young William already shows a measure of the caution born of centuries of royal breeding. Like Charles more than Diana, he is said by friends to be 'wary', 'canny', 'not terribly experimental', reluctant to push the royal envelope further than eons of propriety allow. A chip off the old block, above all, in flaunting an indifference to hoi polloi - hunting to hounds, for instance, in defiance of public opinion, not to mention government policy - 'he doesn't,' according to one friend, 'give a toss what people think'. </p> <p>There have, meanwhile, been encouraging signs that the prince is human: an almighty row with his father, for instance, over the venue for his eighteenth birthday party. Charles favoured the deadly dull setting of Highgrove, whose new 7,000 sq-ft Orchid Room is more suited to earnest conferences about the environment than an all-night rave for Blighty's latest crop of black-tied Hooray Henrys and giggling, falling-out-of-their-party-frocks neo-Sloanes. </p> <p>The party animal in William wanted a London nightclub. But he had to learn an early lesson, which is ominous for his future, by swallowing a compromise in the shape of a semi-stately thrash at Windsor Castle, courtesy of his grandmother, with the oldsters retiring tactfully at midnight to let the young things rave on. Another early lesson might be a caution that the party falls right in the middle of his A-levels when he should be revising. </p> <p>William has already shown his capacity for raving (in the strictly ballroom sense) at last summer's Cartier polo lunch, where he held court as a guest of his 26-year-old chum Edward van Cutsem, son of the couple closest to Charles and Camilla. In wraparound sunglasses and navy blue blazer with gold buttons - 'a little Eurotrash,' according to fashion guru Daisy Garnett, 'but, hell, it worked' - Wills apparently spent most of lunch romancing Victoria Aitken, daughter of Jonathan, the former Tory Minister who was jailed for perjury. So hard did Victoria laugh at her future king's jokes that she looked, to one watching journalist, 'like she might swallow his head'. </p> <p>Breaking all the royal rules, William had not told the Palace, nor its press office, nor indeed his father of his plans to attend the lunch. 'What are you doing here?' the Queen asked him in surprise, barely recognising her favourite grandson behind his wraparounds. William was blas\u00e9. 'Why should he tell the Palace about everything he does?' mused a friend. 'He doesn't. He does what he wants and that's the end of it.' </p> <p>Not for long. At the Cartier lunch, Wills may be the racy prince who mixes with a louche, witless set of drug-dabbling friends. Otherwise, as royals go, he is conventionally privileged, and disturbingly at ease with it all. How many other British 17-year-olds have their own car, flash apartment (a set of rooms at St James's Palace) and a Coutts gold card? </p> <p>In his last year at Eton he is reported (again like his father) to be 'no more than averagely bright', taking A-levels in biology, geography and history of art which will decide his university place, according to Buckingham Palace 'strictly on merit'. Although a fine shot (which runs in the family, despite his mother's loathing for blood sports) and a keen swimmer (as was Diana), he is not otherwise as sporty, least of all on horseback, as most of his royal cousins and forebears. </p> <p>William does not seem to be eccentric, short-fused and moody (like his father) or neurotic, wilful and manipulative (like his mother). Neither affected nor pretentious, he is more level-headed than Harry. Wills is more responsible. But he smokes cigarettes, anathema to both his parents, and enjoys a drink as does Dad, though Mum rarely took more than a sip of Chardonnay. He also moves on the fringes of an older set centred on Tom Parker Bowles, son of Camilla, of whom, according to the Palace line, he warmly approves. </p> <p>But the palace does not approve of the company he keeps. Here we enter the grey area where the royals must be allowed, to the occasional despair of their courtiers, to behave as human beings. Throughout the Queen's 48-year reign, her press spokesmen have conceded one official 'wart': that she is an over-indulgent mother. When Prince Edward proposed his disastrous It's A Royal Knockout, for instance, and prescient advisers urged the Queen to talk him out of it, she is said to have taken the line: 'No, I can't. At least the boy's doing something.' </p> <p>Charles appears to have become equally indulgent. When Tom Parker Bowles was caught in possession of drugs, quasi-stepfather Charles read him the riot act, to his real father's considerable annoyance. But there is no record of a similar rebuke to his son for mixing in such circles, or any apparent attempt to remove him from them. What, after all, would Camilla say? </p> <p>William hero-worships 24-year-old Tom, but is said to be too 'sensible' to dabble, even in soft drugs, himself. The 'child-of-his-times' prince is nevertheless as worrying for the senior royals as he is entertaining (and endearing) for the nation. Which way will William jump? Will the Charles in him sober up and confront the responsibilities that go with his birth? Or will the Diana in him kick against the royal pricks and make him go his own rebellious way? Although he will not officially embark upon public life until his twenty-first birthday, and Charles will meanwhile continue to block unwelcome publicity through the stringent code of conduct issued to the press, even on matters of undoubted public interest, these are becoming urgent questions in Palace circles. (In one incident last year the Palace prevented the News of the World publishing pictures of William on holiday with friends in Cornwall. The friends were drinking, William was not.) </p> <p>As the Queen enters her seventy-fifth year, her mother will turn 100 this summer. Might the younger Elizabeth live as long? Might Charles even die before his mother? Might the feistier backbenchers of a narrowly re-elected Labour Government prefer to consign the monarchy to the tourist-rich museum where it rationally belongs? </p> <p>Might Wills himself, once exposed to the scepticism of his university generation, come round to this view? He did so in a scenario envisaged by playwright Peter Whelan (a recent guest, ironically, at Sandringham), whose 1996 Divine Right portrayed a reflective William making an incognito tour of the Midlands, canvassing views on the Crown. At its climactic secret rendezvous in a field near Sandringham, William tells Harry he's decided to pass, and let the monarchy die a natural death. </p> <p>'But they want us, they need us,' pleads his stunned younger brother. 'That's just the point,' replies a sadder but wiser William. 'They shouldn't.' </p> <p><strong> The Boy </strong></p> <p><strong> Full Name</strong> William Arthur Philip Louis Windsor. </p> <p><strong> Title</strong> HRH Prince William. </p> <p><strong> Born</strong> 21 June 1982 at 9.03pm, weighing 7lb 10oz at the Lindo wing of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London.

      "bodyText": "There will be mixed royal emotions at Prince William's eighteenth birthday party on 21 June, when this last, best hope for the monarchy's long-term future, 'as earnest and dutiful as his father, as wayward and fun-loving as his mother', becomes eligible to inherit the throne in his own right. Which future king will eventually emerge from his sleek teenage chrysalis: the Windsorised Spencer, solemnly bent on his royal destiny, or the Spencerised Windsor, ready to play fast and loose with his hereditary privilege? Much royal breath has yet to be held, as tabloid reports of William's drug-taking chums vie for space with a long, hot summer of bad-news polls for his father, no doubt showing, as they consistently have to date, that even diehard monarchists would rather pass on King Charles III and get on with William V, offering as dramatically new, young and dynamic a face to the world as the succession from Thatcher-Major to Blair.

His and Diana's sisters, Sarah and Jane, made a braver effort to continue the parental work she so ardently began. But now it is clear the Windsors have won an easy victory. Diana's true friends mist up at the thought of her missing her beloved Wills's eighteenth birthday. 'She would,' they say, 'have been so proud.' Might she also have been a tad worried? Is Charles? Is the Queen? As he formally attains manhood, William is the world's most eligible bachelor, heir to a 10-figure fortune and the most glamorous job on the planet. He's a looker, too: tall, strapping, drop-dead handsome, with a tousled crop of (natural) blond hair and Botticelli features fresh-minted from those of his mother, around whose same dazzling smile the world for a while seemed to turn. Even if he weren't who he is, William would turn heads and break hearts. But, given his uniquely storm-tossed life so far, and the fragile, mildly depressive psycho-profile of both his parents, it seems a miracle that he isn't a gibbering basket-case. The story of William's first 18 years has amounted to little more than that of his parents' visceral and all too public marital warfare. Before he even entered his teens, both had chosen to confess on global television to adultery, his father expressing a spooky ambition to morph into his mistress's Tampax, his mother owning up to indoor as well as outdoor riding lessons with a dashing cavalry officer. Their protracted public catfight was resolved only by a brutal divorce, stripping the princess of her royal rank and consigning her (as even the Daily Telegraph has put it) to the 'demi-monde', where she met her end in the arms of an Onassis-type playboy lover. William, say his friends, has made a remarkable recovery from the abrupt loss of his devoted (too devoted?) if somewhat unstable mother. His father is visibly relieved to have Diana out of the way, flourishing as never before since she has not been around to harass and upstage him, but William seems to have bottled up his grief and filed it in some corner cupboard of his life. One day, you sense, it must return to haunt him. 'It's amazing,' says one young chum. 'If you hang out with him - considering the shit he has gone through - even right after it happened you wouldn't notice that anything had bothered him at all.' Not, perhaps, altogether healthy. But William has been trained from birth to wield the stiff upper Windsor lip which supposedly symbolises the hopes and dreams of a great nation, once a mighty empire, even if, in Tony Blair's supposedly 'modernised' Britain, this seems incongruous. But in these irritatingly democratic times, when hereditary peers are kicked out of Parliament after a mere 600 years, the monarchy's best hopes of even medium-term survival rest in the box-office appeal of this seemingly pleasant young innocent, with signs of both his mother's winning ways and his father's stultifying gravitas. At least Diana was around long enough to leave William memo ries more down-to-earth than the young Charles was ever allowed: queueing in Marks &amp; Spencer to pay for his purchases, playing video games alongside children his own age in Piccadilly Circus, fast food at Planet Hollywood, fun days out at Thorpe Park, even sneaking under age into 18-certificate films (not to mention, of course, visiting the homeless). Weekends with Charles, meanwhile, consisted of what Diana called 'killing things' - hunting and shooting - plus tweedy charades and some racy under-age driving of Range Rovers around the royal estate amid hour upon hour of fatherless frolics with surrogate mum Tiggy Legge-Bourke. So which parent has left the stronger mark on William? Like Diana more than Charles, the student prince is a card-carrying fun lover who can party with the best of them. Friends joke that he lost his innocence somewhere in the Aegean last summer during his father's annual freebie cruise aboard Greek billionaire John Latsis's yacht. 'He likes women a lot,' one double-barrelled chum recently told America's Talk magazine. 'Yes, he's definitely a player.' Talk 's current issue mischievously pairs off the prince with a gallery of potential future Queens, from Princess Madeleine of Sweden and one Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe to Holly Branson, Elizabeth Jagger and Madonna's three-year-old daughter Lourdes (well, Diana was five when Charles turned 18). 'He's never even met Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe,' spluttered a pal. 'She'd like to meet him, though...' It is supposedly because of the comely 'Izzy' Winkler, a 22-year-old socialite studying philosophy at Edinburgh University, that William has set his academic sights on the Athens of the North rather than Oxbridge, like his father (and all recent male monarchs) before him. But this is a twenty-first-century prince who emails his fellow teen-star Britney Spears, admits to fancying Baby Spice and has even been seen 'snogging' the 25-year-old that mutual friends saucily refer to as his 'cousin', Emma Parker Bowles, niece of his father's long-time consort Camilla. 'Nothing much came of it,' his chum told Talk. 'But still, it's pretty good, to snog a 25-year-old when you're only 17.' Snogging - and much more - is high on the agenda of the gilded British youth among whom William moves: many a virginity is surrendered beneath the manicured bushes at house parties in the 'royal triangle' of rural Gloucestershire (close to his father's organic farm at Highgrove) or Norfolk (near granny's pile at Sandringham). Amid a fusillade of double-barrelled names, from Duckworth-Chad to Palmer-Tomkinson, horny young toffs with nicknames like Hoggins and Rollo love bandying tampon jokes while throwing bread rolls at their belles at the end of hedonistic days spent hunting, shooting, fishing, getting drunk and singing rugby songs. Much as he loves this world, and feels alarmingly at home in it, young William already shows a measure of the caution born of centuries of royal breeding. Like Charles more than Diana, he is said by friends to be 'wary', 'canny', 'not terribly experimental', reluctant to push the royal envelope further than eons of propriety allow. A chip off the old block, above all, in flaunting an indifference to hoi polloi - hunting to hounds, for instance, in defiance of public opinion, not to mention government policy - 'he doesn't,' according to one friend, 'give a toss what people think'. There have, meanwhile, been encouraging signs that the prince is human: an almighty row with his father, for instance, over the venue for his eighteenth birthday party. Charles favoured the deadly dull setting of Highgrove, whose new 7,000 sq-ft Orchid Room is more suited to earnest conferences about the environment than an all-night rave for Blighty's latest crop of black-tied Hooray Henrys and giggling, falling-out-of-their-party-frocks neo-Sloanes. The party animal in William wanted a London nightclub. But he had to learn an early lesson, which is ominous for his future, by swallowing a compromise in the shape of a semi-stately thrash at Windsor Castle, courtesy of his grandmother, with the oldsters retiring tactfully at midnight to let the young things rave on. Another early lesson might be a caution that the party falls right in the middle of his A-levels when he should be revising. William has already shown his capacity for raving (in the strictly ballroom sense) at last summer's Cartier polo lunch, where he held court as a guest of his 26-year-old chum Edward van Cutsem, son of the couple closest to Charles and Camilla. In wraparound sunglasses and navy blue blazer with gold buttons - 'a little Eurotrash,' according to fashion guru Daisy Garnett, 'but, hell, it worked' - Wills apparently spent most of lunch romancing Victoria Aitken, daughter of Jonathan, the former Tory Minister who was jailed for perjury. So hard did Victoria laugh at her future king's jokes that she looked, to one watching journalist, 'like she might swallow his head'. Breaking all the royal rules, William had not told the Palace, nor its press office, nor indeed his father of his plans to attend the lunch. 'What are you doing here?' the Queen asked him in surprise, barely recognising her favourite grandson behind his wraparounds. William was blas\u00e9. 'Why should he tell the Palace about everything he does?' mused a friend. 'He doesn't. He does what he wants and that's the end of it.' Not for long. At the Cartier lunch, Wills may be the racy prince who mixes with a louche, witless set of drug-dabbling friends. Otherwise, as royals go, he is conventionally privileged, and disturbingly at ease with it all. How many other British 17-year-olds have their own car, flash apartment (a set of rooms at St James's Palace) and a Coutts gold card? In his last year at Eton he is reported (again like his father) to be 'no more than averagely bright', taking A-levels in biology, geography and history of art which will decide his university place, according to Buckingham Palace 'strictly on merit'. Although a fine shot (which runs in the family, despite his mother's loathing for blood sports) and a keen swimmer (as was Diana), he is not otherwise as sporty, least of all on horseback, as most of his royal cousins and forebears. William does not seem to be eccentric, short-fused and moody (like his father) or neurotic, wilful and manipulative (like his mother). Neither affected nor pretentious, he is more level-headed than Harry. Wills is more responsible. But he smokes cigarettes, anathema to both his parents, and enjoys a drink as does Dad, though Mum rarely took more than a sip of Chardonnay. He also moves on the fringes of an older set centred on Tom Parker Bowles, son of Camilla, of whom, according to the Palace line, he warmly approves. But the palace does not approve of the company he keeps. Here we enter the grey area where the royals must be allowed, to the occasional despair of their courtiers, to behave as human beings. Throughout the Queen's 48-year reign, her press spokesmen have conceded one official 'wart': that she is an over-indulgent mother. When Prince Edward proposed his disastrous It's A Royal Knockout, for instance, and prescient advisers urged the Queen to talk him out of it, she is said to have taken the line: 'No, I can't. At least the boy's doing something.' Charles appears to have become equally indulgent. When Tom Parker Bowles was caught in possession of drugs, quasi-stepfather Charles read him the riot act, to his real father's considerable annoyance. But there is no record of a similar rebuke to his son for mixing in such circles, or any apparent attempt to remove him from them. What, after all, would Camilla say? William hero-worships 24-year-old Tom, but is said to be too 'sensible' to dabble, even in soft drugs, himself. The 'child-of-his-times' prince is nevertheless as worrying for the senior royals as he is entertaining (and endearing) for the nation. Which way will William jump? Will the Charles in him sober up and confront the responsibilities that go with his birth? Or will the Diana in him kick against the royal pricks and make him go his own rebellious way? Although he will not officially embark upon public life until his twenty-first birthday, and Charles will meanwhile continue to block unwelcome publicity through the stringent code of conduct issued to the press, even on matters of undoubted public interest, these are becoming urgent questions in Palace circles. (In one incident last year the Palace prevented the News of the World publishing pictures of William on holiday with friends in Cornwall. The friends were drinking, William was not.) As the Queen enters her seventy-fifth year, her mother will turn 100 this summer. Might the younger Elizabeth live as long? Might Charles even die before his mother? Might the feistier backbenchers of a narrowly re-elected Labour Government prefer to consign the monarchy to the tourist-rich museum where it rationally belongs? Might Wills himself, once exposed to the scepticism of his university generation, come round to this view? He did so in a scenario envisaged by playwright Peter Whelan (a recent guest, ironically, at Sandringham), whose 1996 Divine Right portrayed a reflective William making an incognito tour of the Midlands, canvassing views on the Crown. At its climactic secret rendezvous in a field near Sandringham, William tells Harry he's decided to pass, and let the monarchy die a natural death. 'But they want us, they need us,' pleads his stunned younger brother. 'That's just the point,' replies a sadder but wiser William. 'They shouldn't.'

After the initial shock, we became used to the idea and are looking forward to the birth. Our daughter is delighted and has been very supportive but our son is very 'cross' with us. He has let us know that he thinks 'it is disgusting' to have a baby 'at our age' and has been generally sulky and uncooperative. His attitude is starting to upset me. Is his reaction normal? And what can we do to help him accept and love his new brother or sister? </b> <p><b> A.S. South London</b> </p> <p>Yes, his reaction is quite normal and is influenced particularly by his age, his gender and his position in the family. </p> <p>There are at least two elements to his hostility. First is that he resents being replaced as the youngest and most cosseted member of the family group, especially as he has long felt secure in that position. </p> <p>In small-sized human families, the problem is seldom insuperable or serious. At 14 your son is nearly ready to spread his wings, and a tiny infant with needs so totally different won't present a threat for long. </p> <p>The second factor in his antipathy is his sexual awareness, which will be in hormonal spate. By his perception, sexual adventures are areas of risk, a prerogative of the young. He probably really does imagine that this is something exhausted, ancient people relinquish in their mid-twenties. It has an aura of the forbidden, the dark and the sinful, a function that seems light-years away from his respectable, middle-aged parents. </p> <p>By the same logical misconception, he will not (again subconsciously) associate sex with the baby that will eventually appear, so the second source of his anger will subside soon enough in a welter of domesticity. It is almost certain that he will be enchanted by the new arrival, so it's important to prepare the way for a complete turnaround in his attitude, without him losing face. </p> <p>To this end, you should try to ignore his present negative vibes; neither being tight-lipped or overly-reassuring. Divest them altogether of tense associations. </p> <p>Hang loose and accept he needs a bit more space. For instance, if you and your daughter want to go out shopping for prams and nappies, you could say: 'Son, you won't want to come.

      "bodyText": "At the ripe old age of 42, I find myself pregnant again. My husband is 45 and we already have two children: a 16-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy. After the initial shock, we became used to the idea and are looking forward to the birth. Our daughter is delighted and has been very supportive but our son is very 'cross' with us. He has let us know that he thinks 'it is disgusting' to have a baby 'at our age' and has been generally sulky and uncooperative. His attitude is starting to upset me. Is his reaction normal? And what can we do to help him accept and love his new brother or sister? A.S. South London Yes, his reaction is quite normal and is influenced particularly by his age, his gender and his position in the family. There are at least two elements to his hostility. First is that he resents being replaced as the youngest and most cosseted member of the family group, especially as he has long felt secure in that position. In small-sized human families, the problem is seldom insuperable or serious. At 14 your son is nearly ready to spread his wings, and a tiny infant with needs so totally different won't present a threat for long. The second factor in his antipathy is his sexual awareness, which will be in hormonal spate. By his perception, sexual adventures are areas of risk, a prerogative of the young. He probably really does imagine that this is something exhausted, ancient people relinquish in their mid-twenties. It has an aura of the forbidden, the dark and the sinful, a function that seems light-years away from his respectable, middle-aged parents. By the same logical misconception, he will not (again subconsciously) associate sex with the baby that will eventually appear, so the second source of his anger will subside soon enough in a welter of domesticity. It is almost certain that he will be enchanted by the new arrival, so it's important to prepare the way for a complete turnaround in his attitude, without him losing face. To this end, you should try to ignore his present negative vibes; neither being tight-lipped or overly-reassuring. Divest them altogether of tense associations. Hang loose and accept he needs a bit more space. For instance, if you and your daughter want to go out shopping for prams and nappies, you could say: 'Son, you won't want to come. We're having lunch out, but you'll manage to look after yourself, won't you?' At the same time, his father might take him away for some masculine pursuit such as a day's fishing. Such times for gender-bonding are healthy and reinforce the family ties. Your son is at an age where he's changing and developing at the gallop, progressively becoming independent yet still clutching at his roots. He'll need to be reassured that his place in the home, both spatially and metaphorically, won't be usurped. With that security, his new sibling will be well received.

      "body": "<p>One in five workers has taken time off in the past year because of back pain. And four out of five occasionally suffer from aches and pains or worse, according to the public service trade union Unison. </p> <p>For many people, the physical difficulties lead to emotional and financial problems too, but much of this hardship is unnecessary. </p> <p>Prevention - the solution Unison is urging on the Government - could cost as little as \u00a320, and save you years of pain and perhaps even thousands of pounds in lost income if you have to give up your job. The major problem is that the National Health Service focuses primarily on treating illness and injury - but does relatively little to prevent problems arising in the first place. Going to an osteopath can help you to spot the stresses and strains your body is undergoing years before they start to impair the quality of your life. </p> <p>Other alternative therapists, including hypnotherapists, acupuncturists and masseurs, also place a strong emphasis on prevention. So if you want to see one, how much will it cost? Can you get discounts? And can you ever get this kind of treatment for free? The answer to the last two questions is yes. </p> <p>The starting point to finding an alternative therapist is the relevant professional body or ruling council. The British Acupuncture Council (BAC), for instance, will send you a free list of practitioners in your area. One of the potential problems with complementary medicine is that practitioners are unregulated in many fields. While the BAA monitors its 2,000 members carefully, insisting that all have at least two years' full-time experience, anyone can call themselves an acupuncturist. </p> <p>Members of a reputable body will be required to take out professional indemnity insurance - usually covering claims of up to \u00a32 million if their treatment does you damage. You should ask to see their indemnity policy. You may reason that you are highly unlikely to make a claim against it, but the fact that they have a policy in place suggests that they have a professional approach to running their business. </p> <p>You will also see therapists listed in the Yellow Pages - or you may follow up a recommendation from a friend. </p> <p>The BAA suggests that people ring up a few local practitioners to compare their approaches - and their prices. As a rough guide, prices are likely to be \u00a350-\u00a360 for the first session. This could last more than an hour because, unlike conventional medical advisers, they will want to make a general, holistic, assessment of you first. Subsequent sessions are likely to last between 40 minutes and an hour, and will usually cost somewhere between \u00a320 and \u00a340. </p> <p>Fees to see an osteopath are similar - typically \u00a325-\u00a330 per session, according to the General Osteopathic Council (GOC). This body sends out free lists of local practitioners. Osteopaths have only just become subject to new regulations. Since May 9, anyone calling themselves an osteopath has to be registered with the GOC. It currently lists about 1,800 members, with another 900 applications in the pipeline. </p> <p>Intense price competition is not a feature of the alternative therapy world. </p> <p>'Most of our members don't want to turn someone away because they cannot afford it,' says Ann Collins of the GOC. 'Ask an osteopath why they are in the profession and they'll usually say it's because they want to help people.' </p> <p>Osteopaths, psychotherapists, chiropracters and other therapists appear to be far less motivated by money than their colleagues in mainstream medicine. They earn far less than dentists and solicitors - and the cost to clients is far less. </p> <p>London-based osteopath John Fudge is typical of many alternative practitioners. He charges \u00a325 for a session lasting between 40 and 60 minutes in his Finsbury Park practice. But he works a couple of days a week in a group practice of seven osteopaths, an acupuncturist and two massage therapists. This is located in the more affluent Winchmore Hill. His fee there is \u00a330. He says: 'In a lot of smaller practices, you get sessions that last 40 minutes to an hour. But in practices where there is a receptionist, it's more likely to be half an hour. And it'll probably be a bit more expensive.' </p> <p>Most therapists will consider reduced fees to people on low incomes. 'If anyone asks for a concession, I almost always give it,' says Fudge. 'I give \u00a35 off to OAPs, people who are out of work and students.' </p> <p>But even if you do not fall into one of these categories, practitioners are often sympathetic. Psychotherapists - who sometimes see clients over a period of years - often refrain from putting the price up with inflation if they think a client is struggling with the cost. And they are often open to negotiation if a regular client feels hard up. </p> <p>There are other possible avenues for those who cannot afford to pay. Some doctors will now refer patients to alternative therapists. Some surgeries are bringing in alternative therapists to practise alongside the doctors. About 40 per cent of GP surgeries now give some access to complementary medicine, according to De Montfort University. </p> <p>Free or cut-price treatment is available through the therapists' training schools - although these tend to be concentrated in London. Free treatment is available through the seven BAA-approved colleges in England: three are in London and the others are in York, Warwickshire, West Sussex and Reading. </p> <p>There is another possibility for those who want a free massage. Employers are increasingly allowing their office-bound workers to get a massage at work. This would typically cost \u00a310-\u00a320 for a 10-20 minute session in London - but could be half the price elsewhere. You often find that a masseur or (more usually) masseuse will give a free massage to the person who organises an afternoon's session for the workplace. </p> <p>People who have private medical insurance will sometimes find that this covers some forms of alternative therapy. Medical insurer OHRA covers six alternative treatments - including homeopathy, osteopathy and medical herbalism - on its main policies. Policyholders can 'self-refer' instead of going through a GP, but they can only do this if they have a specific complaint. Medical insurers have yet to get to grips with preventative medicine. Even so, OHRA is very satisfied with the way policyholders make use of the alternative options. </p> <p>One person with a whiplash injury, for instance, would see an orthopaedic consultant and a physiotherapist if they opted for traditional medicine. They could also be prescribed drugs. Another person would prefer to visit a chiropractor. 'There's no doubt that the alternative route is the less expensive,' says OHRA spokeswoman Hazel Berrill. Typical initial costs, she says, would be \u00a360-\u00a380 to see an orthopaedic specialist, but \u00a330-\u00a345 to see a chiropractor. </p> <p>But in the long run, medical insurers have a strong interest in getting people on their books who keep themselves healthy and who go in for preventative treatment. </p> <p>'Alternative therapists used to be viewed as quacks,' says Kevin Morgan of adviser Litecastle. 'But increasingly they are coming into the mainstream. The issue of prevention will become more important. I am sure that more lifestyle bonus points will be built into medical cover contracts.' </p> <p>Fudge makes a strong argument for even the fit and healthy to make a preventative visit to an osteopath: 'You can save yourself a huge amount of grief. If your posture is bad, for instance, it can lead to all sorts of problems - digestive problems, breathing disorders, even poor circulation in the hands. Doctors understand this but they can't prescribe prevention. They only prescribe when you're ill. They don't have the time to say: \"Come back next month and I'll see how your posture is.\" So most people aren't aware anything is wrong until their back goes or there is some other problem.' </p> <p>\u0095 British Acupuncture Council: 020 8735 0400 or <a href=\"http://www.acupuncture.org.uk\">www.acupuncture.org.uk</a>.

      "body": "<p>Marcia Road is right up John Prescott's street. It is a set of homes being built on a brownfield site in Southwark, south London, in a traditional terrace design and aimed at attracting people with children to an area with few cheap family homes. This is what the Deputy Prime Minister wants for south-east England. </p> <p>But there's a twist. Marcia Road is a replica of the same street first constructed, in the same place, in 1880. The original 68 houses on Marcia Road were built by the local authority in what was then the relatively prosperous Bermondsey docks area of south London. </p> <p>They were missed by German bombers during the Second World War and were narrowly avoided by the town planners who destroyed much of the area in the Sixties and Seventies when they erected tower blocks in sur rounding streets. But by the Nineties most of the houses had been converted into flats, reflecting the reluctance of many families to live in what was becoming a characteristically difficult inner-city area. Age had taken its toll and maintenance bills for Marcia Road were rising at the same time as funding for Southwark Council's housing repairs were being cut. In 1998 the authority put the entire street up for sale. </p> <p>Southwark had numerous developers interested in the street, but Galliard Homes outbid the others - the council won't reveal the price paid, but prior to the sale it said it was hoping for \u00a32 million. </p> <p>'Before the project got under way, four or five residents who had bought their homes under the Right To Buy scheme sold them back to the council,' according to Southwark spokesman Matt Grainger. </p> <p>Galliard soon realised it would be cheaper to rebuild than to refurbish. 'We had hoped to keep them, but it became obvious they would cost too much to renovate,' says sales and marketing manager Madeleine Flower. </p> <p>'We wanted to keep the look of the street exactly as it had been. It was a nice Victorian road, so we decided to rebuild the frontages with all their original detail, to fit in with the surroundings and because people like these sorts of properties,' she says. </p> <p>The new Marcia Road is, from the outside, a replica of the old one in weathered London stone and period detail above windows and front doors. Only four houses are complete so far, with the remaining 64 to be finished over the next 12 months. </p> <p>Once inside a finished home, the twenty-first century kicks in. Each house has four bedrooms plus reception rooms arranged over three floors, plus a small back garden. Different properties offer various first-floor study or dressing room options. </p> <p>The prices are distinctly modern, too, with the new 68 houses ranging from \u00a3275,000 to \u00a3300,000 for one at the end of the terrace.

      "bodyText": "Marcia Road is right up John Prescott's street. It is a set of homes being built on a brownfield site in Southwark, south London, in a traditional terrace design and aimed at attracting people with children to an area with few cheap family homes. This is what the Deputy Prime Minister wants for south-east England. But there's a twist. Marcia Road is a replica of the same street first constructed, in the same place, in 1880. The original 68 houses on Marcia Road were built by the local authority in what was then the relatively prosperous Bermondsey docks area of south London. They were missed by German bombers during the Second World War and were narrowly avoided by the town planners who destroyed much of the area in the Sixties and Seventies when they erected tower blocks in sur rounding streets. But by the Nineties most of the houses had been converted into flats, reflecting the reluctance of many families to live in what was becoming a characteristically difficult inner-city area. Age had taken its toll and maintenance bills for Marcia Road were rising at the same time as funding for Southwark Council's housing repairs were being cut. In 1998 the authority put the entire street up for sale. Southwark had numerous developers interested in the street, but Galliard Homes outbid the others - the council won't reveal the price paid, but prior to the sale it said it was hoping for \u00a32 million. 'Before the project got under way, four or five residents who had bought their homes under the Right To Buy scheme sold them back to the council,' according to Southwark spokesman Matt Grainger. Galliard soon realised it would be cheaper to rebuild than to refurbish. 'We had hoped to keep them, but it became obvious they would cost too much to renovate,' says sales and marketing manager Madeleine Flower. 'We wanted to keep the look of the street exactly as it had been. It was a nice Victorian road, so we decided to rebuild the frontages with all their original detail, to fit in with the surroundings and because people like these sorts of properties,' she says. The new Marcia Road is, from the outside, a replica of the old one in weathered London stone and period detail above windows and front doors. Only four houses are complete so far, with the remaining 64 to be finished over the next 12 months. Once inside a finished home, the twenty-first century kicks in. Each house has four bedrooms plus reception rooms arranged over three floors, plus a small back garden. Different properties offer various first-floor study or dressing room options. The prices are distinctly modern, too, with the new 68 houses ranging from \u00a3275,000 to \u00a3300,000 for one at the end of the terrace. But the properties will be almost on top of London Underground's new Ber-mondsey Tube station on the Jubilee Line extension, making the houses attractive for investors wanting a good capital return. Non-Londoners may recoil at paying so much for a Victorian-sized house, but a three-bedroom Georgian townhouse and roof garden in nearby Southwark Bridge Road is going for \u00a3395,000 and a purpose-built two-bedroom apartment with views over the Thames is selling at a cool \u00a3450,000. Back in the eighteen-eighjties the properties would have housed dock labourers and their large families - possibly more than one family per house, even before the conversions into flats. Rents to the council would have been under one shilling per week per property - about 5p. 'Now we're attracting a mix of people, according to Madeleine Flower.

      "body": "<p>Maria Rankine, who leads a busy working life as a quality auditor for the British Standards Institution, rarely visits her own doctor - she is seldom ill. So when a runny nose and blocked ears lingered for several weeks when she was due to fly to the US recently, she did not relish waiting for a GP's appointment. Instead she emailed her symptoms to e-med, the internet medical service, and within four hours an online doctor had diagnosed middle-ear congestion and recommended some nasal decongestants. By the weekend, she was fit to fly. 'I got the advice I wanted without leaving my house,' she says.</p> <p>Francesco Coppola, a City broker who lives in south-west London, has also just signed up with e-med. 'I think it is how a doctor should be - the doctor of the future,' he says. 'I don't have the time to get out of work and wait my turn. It is too slow.' Online medical consultation is already big business in the US. Browse the American-based health websites and you can buy any medical commodity from prescription-only drugs like Viagra and Prozac, to personal advice from doctors - the 'virtual house call', as one site puts it - and even online psychotherapy.</p> <p>Now e-medicine has crossed the Atlantic - much to the consternation of leading doctors. Websites are popping up to offer one-to-one, clinical advice from doctors, nurses, pharmacists, naturopaths and sex therapists. Services vary hugely in what they offer, ranging from the equivalent of a medical agony aunt, who may or may not choose to answer your question, to live, two-way chat with a doctor via email. Doctors and nurses who work online are qualified in the usual way, but alternative therapy on the net is no less a grey area than in real life.</p> <p>Even the government is getting in on the act. Its health website, NHS Direct Online, launched by Tony Blair in December, attracts about 150,000 hits a day. Such sites are clearly meeting a demand from people too busy, too lazy, too anxious or too embarrassed to discuss their medical complaint with their own GP.</p> <p>Dr Julian Eden, 38, who left his job as an NHS GP last year to launch e-med, agrees. 'This is what people need. It is consumer-led medicine,' he says. For an annual \u00a320 fee, plus \u00a315 for each consultation, he offers not only to diagnose your ailment but also to prescribe treatment and even refer you for tests or specialist opinion, all by email. He is e-med's main practitioner, assisted by a panel of doctors dotted around the country. But while e-med is one of several UK websites now advertising online consultation, he claims his service is unique. Few, if any, other websites undertake definitive diagnosis or prescribing, and some respond to a medical query by suggesting that the patient pose the question in the site's chatroom or check in its archives. This, argues Dr Eden, is tantamount to a GP telling patients to ask around in the waiting room for advice or to sift through a pile of medical records. Most health websites are also peppered with disclaimers, and warn visitors to see their own doctor if symptoms are serious.</p> <p>Such caution is no doubt prompted by growing concern in the medical profession that diagnosis by email is potentially dangerous. The General Medical Council, which polices standards of all UK doctors, no matter what medium they use, has warned that online consulting and prescribing - without a physical examination, when the patient is not already known to the doctor, and where there is little opportunity to monitor treatment - may 'seriously compromise standards of care'.</p> <p>But Dr Eden is convinced that online diagnosis is safe. The vast majority of patients aged 18 to 45 - the age bracket of most of his clients - do not need a physical examination, he says, although he speaks to patients by telephone or invites them to his surgery in Battersea, south London, for an examination, when unsure. Maria Rankine had already visited him in person for her diagnosis of middle-ear congestion.</p> <p>New members fill in a form detailing their medical history, which is kept in a separate, secure system. When they want advice, they complete a 'symptom checker' by email. Dr Eden replies within four hours. Prescriptions may be emailed to an online pharmacist - he has a link with the Allcures website, which delivers medication to your door - or to the chemist nearest the patient's home or workplace (although for legal reasons he has to post a signed prescription, too).</p> <p>Almost all of his 400 patients are professionals reluctant to take time off work to visit their GP with a simple ailment they know needs a prescription-only drug. But Dr Eden also caters for travellers who are struck ill in remote areas and prefer to check into a cybercaf\u00e9 and email a British GP than risk visiting a local hospital where facilities may be basic, at best. He can suggest drugs available over the counter (many of which might be available only on prescription here), or recommend a hospital visit or even returning home.</p> <p>Indeed, Dr Eden, a compulsive traveller, says that the idea for e-med hit him when he was dangerously ill with cerebral malaria and stranded in Ouagadougou, in Burkina Faso, western Africa, with no access to reliable medical advice. 'I swore to myself there must be something better,' he says. In the not-too-distant future, Eden believes, most consultations could be online, with people using WAP mobile phones, which can browse the internet, to seek email advice, and doctors using webcam technology to examine patients.</p> <p>Colleagues in the NHS are unconvinced. While accepting that cybermedicine is probably unstoppable, they are alarmed at the risks of online diagnosis. 'We think it is potentially very dangerous,' says Dr Paul Cundy, who chairs the IT committee of the British Medical Association, and is himself a GP, in Wimbledon. 'One of the skills of a GP is to pick up things in a consultation. You can do that on the telephone, but it is not possible online.'</p> <p>Medical information sent via email may not be secure, he argues, while at the same time the doctor cannot be sure of the patient's identity. The online patient may be a hypochondriac who has already been refused medication by their own GP. Dr Neil Bacon, who runs doctors.net, the medical internet community where doctors talk to each other, agrees. 'An awful lot of doctors have concerns that you cannot do proper diagnosis over the net,' he says. Something that may seem trivial to a patient, like a headache or a cough, could be a symptom of something serious, such as a stroke or TB, he warns. Alternatively, the doctor may always err on the safe side and refer patients for unnecessary tests.</p> <p>While there is clearly a future for online medicine - email could prove invaluable for repeat prescriptions or to clarify information from a consultation - its application will always be limited, he believes. 'The vast majority of patients like the fact they are going to see a doctor.'</p> <p>Other doctors offering online medical advice are also wary of taking e-consultations to extremes. Dr Dan Rutherford, medical director of NetDoctor, one of the biggest UK health sites, says: 'Strictly speaking, the word \"diagnosis\" is inappropriate for the internet.' His site's Ask the Doctor service concentrates on general rather than personal queries, while visitors can also seek advice on sexual difficulties from the site's sex therapists, husband-and-wife team Christine Webber and David Delvin. 'In 10 years' time, online diagnosis may well be commonplace,' says Dr Rutherford, but in the meantime NetDoctor is treading cautiously.</p> <p>Dr Raffi Assadourian, one of five GPs behind the UK website Britmed.com, takes a similar view. 'If anyone ever claims they can diagnose someone over the internet, it is not possible,' he says. 'We make it very clear you cannot replace your conventional doctor.

      "body": "<p>How could I refuse? The phone call came out of the blue, and the voice on the other end was most insistent that I go and have a look at his stepfather's home. 'It's the ceilings', he was saying. 'They're incredible. He's painted them all himself. No, he can't send you some pictures. You have to see them in the flesh.' So off I set to leafy Camberwell in south London, in search of one man's own private Sistine Chapel. </p> <p>Wallace, an artist, lives on the ground floor and basement of one of those fine Georgian terraces that you wonder how anybody possibly affords. With trepidation, I step inside, not quite sure what to expect. The ceilings could be masterful works of art. But I envisage kitsch cherubs with angel's wings, flying from corner to corner. I fix a smile, expecting the worst. Wallace seems friendly enough, and shows me into a light, sunny room with a long table in the middle. The window looks out on to the most glorious leafy garden, meandering into the distance. And while Wallace makes coffee, I dare to glance up at the ceiling. This is not what I expected. It is white. No cherubs. Not an angel wing in sight. But it's not exactly plain. The cornicing is all original - intricately detailed and perfectly formed. It would be a crime to paint this ceiling anything but white. </p> <p>It took Wallace - it's his surname, but that's what most people call him - the best part of a year to restore his dining-room ceiling, and clean away layers of paint that have accumulated over time. It almost drove him mad. Life seemed too short to restore the rest of the ceilings, so Wallace decided to build new ceilings on top of the old ones. 'The design is partly to do with how they are made,' says Wallace. 'I had to deal with the weight on my own.' </p> <p>He started with the kitchen, building a simple ceiling with tongue-and-grooved planks of wood, slotted together. And then things began to get a little more elaborate. In the bedroom, there are blue rag-worked panels, supported by a latticework of red wood. The ceiling is beautifully crafted, with a hint of a Japanese aesthetic. In the hall is a brick-red ceiling with mossy green supports. They have a 30s look, and a touch of the Arts and Crafts movement. Wallace says he was inspired by the work of American architect Louis Sullivan, and the Chicago Library. The idea was to build new ceilings without destroying what was already there. 'The original ceilings are intact,' he says. 'If someone didn't like what I've done, they could take them down and restore what is underneath.' </p> <p>Wallace has a long history with the house. He first moved into the fine terraced Regency crescent in 1967, when he rented a flat on the first floor. He also rented the basement as a studio. Then, in the 70s, he moved out to live around the corner and jumped at the chance to buy the ground floor and his beloved studio when it went on the market in 1986. He remembers paying '90-something'. This summer, however, the house will go back on the market after Wallace has finished 'tarting it up a little' - offers in the region of \u00a3450,000. With or without the ceilings, it's been a good investment. Indeed, Wallace, who is now 60, says 'it's instead of a pension'. He intends to move to Dorset, where he will continue to paint and use the profits to support himself. 'It's a shame I can't keep the place,' he says. 'But you get older and don't have the money.' </p> <p>The house was converted into flats in the early 20th century, and has not changed much since then. A dark hallway leads to the dining room and kitchen, then on to Wallace's office and his bedroom - the one with the red and blue ceiling. The kitchen is at the back of the house, looking out over the gardens. It is clad in wood panelling - all Wallace's own work. Leaning on a wall between the dining room and kitchen is a giant's toothbrush, a maquette for a sculpture by the artist's friend and tutor from his days at Camberwell College of Arts, David Troostwyk. Most of the other art on the walls is Wallace's own. There are word paintings and his most recent, ongoing series of eclipse paintings, which he started before the solar eclipse of last year. </p> <p>Downstairs, past the bathroom which is also clad in wood panelling - this time, ingeniously recycled from old school desks - is the painter's studio. He has done a lot of work on the basement. 'When I first started here it was grim. I wired it up and put some lights in.' These days, the studio is spacious and airy, a huge room at the front filled with half-finished canvases and hospital lights used for working through the night. At the back is Wallace's workshop, where he builds his ceilings and cuts his wood, and a room which leads out to a spiral staircase up to the garden. As part of his 'tarting-up' process, Wallace has laid some pea gravel outside and put some plants out, as well as adding a new toilet to a small utility room down there. It is still rough and raw in the basement, but there is original wood-block flooring and it is a perfect shell to build on. </p> <p>Back upstairs, Wallace is musing on his ceilings again. The hallway works particularly well, with its decorative leaf motif finishing each end of the wooden slats. He's proud of his handiwork. 'I think it looks good. I'd like to copy the ceiling pattern onto the floor. You could easily do it.' He eyes up the floors, his mind working overtime. It looks as though whoever buys the house when it goes on the market this summer will be living with Wallace's art long after he has moved to Dorset.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Michael Dobbs </strong> We grew up in Hertford, in a working-class family. There was always a struggle for money. There were four of us children. I remember our mother sold our piano, I later discovered, to buy our Christmas presents. In many respects Peter and I are chalk and cheese: in some ways you couldn't find brothers with fewer abilities in common. When we were young we loathed one another. Being five years older, he was always leaving school as I was starting. On my first day, the teacher picked me up by the ear and dragged me around the classroom, ranting, 'Look what we've got here, another Dobbs!' I never imagined that we'd be close. He left home at 16, and has spent the past 35 years living in Canada, so I didn't see him for years and years. </p> <p> <strong> Peter Dobbs </strong> Michael and I had a passing relationship. I was the black sheep of the family, always in trouble. I didn't achieve much at school, unlike Michael. I didn't do as well as my father expected me to. I never related to my father at all. I left when I was 22, to bum around the world. I ended up on the west coast of Vancouver Island and have been there for 33 years. I restore old English cars, old Jaguars and Austins. I've always been fixing things. </p> <p>In the early 80s, Michael had been collating family history. He sent me what he'd found and it sparked my interest, and even though I had no family within 8,000 miles, it made me think and I kind of missed my family. I thought all the work he was doing was like searching for an old car: I can search for days in old barns for my cars. Our common interest in genealogy was something we were able to build our relationship with. </p> <p> <strong> MD </strong> While Peter was in Canada, I was at Downing Street when Margaret Thatcher stepped across the threshold in 1975 and for nearly 25 years I was immersed in politics. Then I worked as an aide to John Major. But it was clear things were going horribly wrong. I was becoming disillusioned with the whole lifestyle and the party, it was affecting everything that I did. The evening of the 1997 election was the single most painful night of my life. Politics isn't a job, it's a lifestyle, a career, a social life. I realised that all was lost and wasted. I didn't want to talk to anybody. I wanted to go away and lick my wounds and forget about the world. </p> <p>Peter started to phone weekly from Canada. We never used to talk to each other, and had a relationship which was often very difficult, but he was just there. He'd call, with the frying pan sizzling in the background, and tell me what a wonderful breakfast he was having, which helped me think about other things. I was depressed and pretty miserable. I went through a couple of very bad years. I kept asking, so what's the rest of my life going to be? I had no intention of wandering around as a failed political hack. </p> <p>Fortunately, I've had writing to fall back on [House of Cards and To Play the King were adapted for television]. Throughout it all Peter kept checking on me. Because he's family and he was away, it was easier to relate to him than a person on the spot. He acted as a safety valve, making sure I was getting through it, which I only realised with hindsight. </p> <p> <strong> PD </strong> I had been through similar changes in my life. When you've been in something for 25 years, and you have to take another path, it can be pretty scary. It's good to have a sounding board, someone you can trust. My life now has so little stress in it, and I'd hear him on the other end of the phone recalling his frantic week. I had been trying to nail him down for over a year to take a trip together together. Finally I ended up coming over and we went to Ireland, grave-hunting, meeting wonderful Irish people, and discovering things about the Dobbs family. We know they arrived in Ireland in 1650, but from where we don't yet know. </p> <p>Once you start asking questions, you realise you are a link in a long chain and it becomes interesting to find out what those other links are. We only knew one of our grandparents, and we discovered everything we had been told about them was a pack of lies. Our maternal grandfather, we were told, died. The truth is that when my mother was a baby, he left them in terrible circumstances, with no money and back rent owing. There was a lot of anger and shame. Our mother wouldn't talk about it. </p> <p>She also had a half brother who was another great source of mystery. He was deaf and dumb and badly treated as a child. He is still alive and for a very long time we have been deciding whether to contact him or not. On the one hand, it might be of great relief to him to find he has family, or, at his old age, it might cause him pain. There are so many fractured emotions. Our father never talked very much about his family, either. These days we share all our secrets, everything is open. </p> <p>\u0095 Michael Dobbs's new novel, Whispers of Betrayal, is published by HarperCollins at \u00a39.99</p>",

'You should gently massage the mango like a woman's breast, so that the fruit becomes more juicy,' recommends Vineet Bhatia, 'then peel back the skin and gradually suck the flesh from both the skin and the stone.' I prefer to simply cut the flesh, unskinned and unmolested, away from the stone in four segments.

I might like cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e but I can't expect it on every menu. No, what matters to those who are in the business of trying to recoup the major investment (these days rarely less than \u00a31.5m) that, like a hungry diner, a serious new establishment can so easily swallow.</p> <p>Take, for example, Levant, a new place on London's Wigmore Street specialising in the food of North Africa and the Middle East. Or, should I say, a new venture in an old place, which has had a bit of a makeover. The makeover has been successful, the basement room transformed by the use of clever lighting and 10 shades of caramel into something both soothing and inviting. The staff are exemplary, if a little toothachingly beautiful for my liking.</p> <p>The wine list is sensible and not grossly overpriced. The cocktails are great, the music is not obtrusive and the bowls of olives, pickled radishes and cucumbers are as you would wish them to be.</p> <p>The problem, and I am sure you are ahead of me by now, is the food. It is not even all the food. As I say, there are the olives and great pieces of pillowy flat bread. There were also terrific dips to scoop away while perusing the menu: a subtle taramasalata, a sturdy hummus, and the best examples of baba ghanoush that I've ever tasted.</p> <p>The problem was with the other stuff we ordered from the kitchen. Part of the problem stems, I think, from the concept. Levant is an attempt to take the North African restaurant up-market, away from the crimson and cobalt blue souk fantasies that usually attend such exercises.</p> <p>The chef, Michael Smith, is, as his name suggests, rather less than Levantine, and he has therefore had to learn the vocabulary and grammar of the food he is to cook. As a result, there is something awfully good-mannered about it, as if a fear of serious spicing has overcome the kitchen. It's like belly dancing without enough belly. What's the point?</p> <p>There were six of us at our table, so we were able to give the menu a good work over. A salad of baby broad beans with mint and yoghurt was a perfect example of the problem: it was light and fresh but it lacked any zing. Almond-crusted deep-fried squid with lemon and parsley was an interesting idea, but, again, lacked the lushness that a plate of freshly fried calamari can deliver.</p> <p>The problem was more pronounced in the main courses. Braised, spiced lamb with potatoes and chickpeas was an unobtrusive example of the sort of stew you could get at any taverna. Lemon-marinated, spatchcock poussin suffered the double whammy of tasteless poussin and not enough lemon.</p> <p>The slow-cooked roast kid was one of the fattiest pieces of meat I've ever had, though the meat that lurked beneath the duvets of white fat was sweet and fibrous. The kitchen may respond that this is simply the authentic way of serving roast kid, but that doesn't hold, given that so many of the other dishes were so inauthentic. You can't have it both ways. The puddings we tried - a walnut baklava, lemon semolina cake with lemon syrup and, particularly, almond- stuffed honey dates with clotted cream - were the best things ordered from the menu.</p> <p>Perhaps the food is subservient to the decor, the service, the concept, the buzz. Perhaps I'm a fool to make a fuss, but I don't think so. The fact is I can forgive a restaurant almost anything if it gives me great things to eat. That is the point of going there.

The problem, and I am sure you are ahead of me by now, is the food. It is not even all the food. As I say, there are the olives and great pieces of pillowy flat bread. There were also terrific dips to scoop away while perusing the menu: a subtle taramasalata, a sturdy hummus, and the best examples of baba ghanoush that I've ever tasted. The problem was with the other stuff we ordered from the kitchen. Part of the problem stems, I think, from the concept. Levant is an attempt to take the North African restaurant up-market, away from the crimson and cobalt blue souk fantasies that usually attend such exercises. The chef, Michael Smith, is, as his name suggests, rather less than Levantine, and he has therefore had to learn the vocabulary and grammar of the food he is to cook. As a result, there is something awfully good-mannered about it, as if a fear of serious spicing has overcome the kitchen. It's like belly dancing without enough belly. What's the point? There were six of us at our table, so we were able to give the menu a good work over. A salad of baby broad beans with mint and yoghurt was a perfect example of the problem: it was light and fresh but it lacked any zing. Almond-crusted deep-fried squid with lemon and parsley was an interesting idea, but, again, lacked the lushness that a plate of freshly fried calamari can deliver. The problem was more pronounced in the main courses. Braised, spiced lamb with potatoes and chickpeas was an unobtrusive example of the sort of stew you could get at any taverna. Lemon-marinated, spatchcock poussin suffered the double whammy of tasteless poussin and not enough lemon. The slow-cooked roast kid was one of the fattiest pieces of meat I've ever had, though the meat that lurked beneath the duvets of white fat was sweet and fibrous. The kitchen may respond that this is simply the authentic way of serving roast kid, but that doesn't hold, given that so many of the other dishes were so inauthentic. You can't have it both ways. The puddings we tried - a walnut baklava, lemon semolina cake with lemon syrup and, particularly, almond- stuffed honey dates with clotted cream - were the best things ordered from the menu. Perhaps the food is subservient to the decor, the service, the concept, the buzz. Perhaps I'm a fool to make a fuss, but I don't think so. The fact is I can forgive a restaurant almost anything if it gives me great things to eat. That is the point of going there. Isn't it? \u0095 Levant, Jason Court, 76 Wigmore Street, London W1 (020 7224 1111). Dinner for two, including service and wine, \u00a390. Jay Rayner can be contacted at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk",

Not only does booze appear to be a significant cause of 'air rage', but alcohol's other negative effects on the body are magnified when it is consumed at altitude, which explains why you may both feel drunk faster than usual and suffer from a horrendous hangover on arrival. Its dehydrating action causes your skin to dry out, your head to ache and your energy levels to crash. In addition, a tipple imbibed on an empty stomach can increase your appetite: not only may you feel powerless to resist nibbling on nuts and crisps, but once your main meal arrives, you may still feel ravenous. Because most flyers eat purely out of boredom, the last thing you need is for alcohol to increase this temptation.</p> <p>Most frequent flyers support the argument that if you refrain from alcohol and hydrate your body with water (either still or fizzy, although some people find that drinking fizzy water while flying causes their stomachs to bloat), you'll feel more refreshed when you land. Aim to drink two small glasses of water every hour and stick to a maximum of a couple of cups of tea or coffee, because excess caffeine can also dehydrate the body, causing fluctuating moods, sensitive digestion and headaches. If you're a well-organised traveller, tuck a few herbal teabags in your hand luggage (camomile encourages sleep, while mint aids the digestion). If you're feeling peckish, a caffeine-free drink can also serve as an appetite-questioner: are you feeling hungry because you're genuinely in need of nourishment or because you're bored?</p> <p>You are probably familiar with the in-flight tendency of feet and hands to swell. This most commonly occurs as a result of a temporary imbalance in the level of salt (sodium) in your blood, and consuming salty foods, such as crisps, nuts and olives, makes matters worse. Potassium, on the other hand, helps to correct this imbalance and reduces fluid retention, so while on board, try to boost your intake of potassium-rich foods, including fresh fruit and vegetables such as bananas and tomatoes, or fresh fruit juices, like orange. This doesn't mean that you should eat nothing but raw food while you're flying, just that you should ask for grapes or an apple to accompany cheese, for example. Fruit also slowly releases energy-giving sugar, along with some fibre, into the body, thereby keeping the digestive system active. Even dried fruits, which can easily be stowed in a travel bag, can serve as a good inflight nibble.</p> <p>Eating something healthy every few hours reduces the likelihood of inflight indigestion, particularly if you have a weakness such as a hiatus hernia, an acidic stomach, an ulcer or intestinal bloating, all of which can be exacerbated by the increase in cabin pressure. The digestive system generally finds it hard to digest fatty, spicy or overly sweet foods, which is not helped by the way many airline-catering companies dowse their food in sauces. A pressurised gut responds well to simply cooked chicken or fish (if it's served with a rich sauce, scrape off as much as possible), pasta or a sandwich without mayonnaise.</p> <p>Eating to influence how your body feels is one of the most important things that you can do when flying. Pasta, potatoes and other starchy foods can induce soporific feelings to help lull your body to sleep or to relax. Because high-fibre starches, such as wholegrain toast, rolls or crispbreads, provide your body with a sustaining energy boost, they can constitute a healthy inflight breakfast, particularly when eaten with fruit. Although croissants and Danish pastries may provide instant gratification, because they contain high levels of fat and sugar, you won't feel satiated for long and may be tempted to devour more food on arrival.</p> <p>If your body is calling out for a substantial, energising brunch or lunch, try to include some protein-rich foods - smoked salmon, scrambled eggs or lean charcuterie - in your meal. Opting for protein can also be helpful when you're flying westward and gaining hours, because protein energises you rather than making you feel sleepy. Ideally, accompany the protein source with some fibre (perhaps a wholegrain roll), or follow it with fruit. You could also pack a small nutritional first-aid kit, including a bottle of echinacea tincture, which will boost your immune system, helping it to ward off the bacteria and viruses circulating around the cabin. (The recommended dose is typically in the region of either a 500mg capsule or tablet or three-quarters to one teaspoon of tincture dissolved in a small amount of water, taken three times a day.) If you suffer from stomach or bowel bloating, try taking acidophilus pills (the recommended dose is usually about 20mg a day), preferably with a little yogurt, or if this isn't available, some still water. All in all, when packing your suitcase, remember that packing the right nutrients into your body will result in a healthy glow that will far outshine your suntan.</p> <p>\u0095 Jane Clarke is a state-registered dietician and author of The Bodyfoods series of books</p>",

Her technique of pouring thinned paint directly on to huge unprimed canvasses - colour staining - was taken up by her better-known contemporaries Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland. Now 71, of all the women on the American art scene today she is probably the most recognised and celebrated, yet in this country, unlike her peers, she is barely represented. Here, sculptor Sir Anthony Caro, friend of Frankenthaler's for 40 years, talks about the woman and her work</p> <p>I went to America in 1959 on a travel scholarship and when I was in New York I visited a critic called Dor\u00e9 Ashton. Who should be there but Helen and her husband, the painter Bob Motherwell? They offered me a lift to my hotel, so we went uptown together and, on the way, they said: 'You must be lonesome here, you don't know anybody. We'll give a party for you.' That's how friendly they were. They gave a wonderful party. I was sitting next to the film star Hedy Lamarr, which was a surprise. The sculptor David Smith was there and the painter Franz Kline. It was amazing to come in as a young man not knowing anybody and find that tremendously welcoming attitude.</p> <p>We didn't talk about our work then, but in 1963 I went back for two years with my wife, the painter Sheila Girling, and my two sons, to teach at Bennington College in Vermont, where Helen had been a student. At the weekends a lot of practising artists were around. I got to know her better then, but it wasn't until she divorced Bob in 1971 that I really got to know her as a person and to talk about art. She had been very close to Clement Greenberg years before and we all used to meet often at Kenneth Noland's farm.</p> <p>Jules Olitski - another painter - Noland, Helen and I were all going in the same direction really. Coming from Britain and meeting those artists in New York was a knockout. They weren't hamstrung by history, which I think we were in England. In America they were saying, 'We've got to push the boundaries.' They were very open to experiment, especially with new materials, and they worked on a grand scale, buying canvas by the roll, which I had never seen before. We went to each other's studios and discussed and criticised each other's work. It was completely different from what I had known. In England, one had little contact with other artists' studios, except of course at the sculpture department at St Martin's School of Art, where I was teaching.</p> <p>Olitski, Noland, Helen and I shared a whole aesthetic. Trying to be direct, not let a lot of technical stuff get in the way. I think that's why I turned to steel. Because it isn't cast, you don't have to make a great big armature before you start. Paintings like Helen's Mountains and Sea are very direct. They are painted on the unprimed canvas, using the acrylic very thinly: bang - there it is. It's a big painting but it's painted like a watercolour. That sort of directness is something that I share with her - trying to get your feelings to come straight through without a lot of barriers. Noland used to talk about one-shot painting - it comes out of abstract expressionism and Pollock.</p> <p>Helen's language is paint. It seems to come straight from her. She's a tremendous natural painter, and that's not an easy thing to pass on. People who want to really enjoy the quality of the paint and the paper, letting go a bit, they've been influenced by her. She's not an ideas painter, she's a painter's painter. That's very unfashionable at the moment and that's probably why she's not mentioned as much as she should be.

Suddenly I got a letter saying, 'How about in three weeks' time?' That was in 1972. She worked in my studio here in Camden [north London]. She'd work full days for two or three weeks and was incredibly direct. Her eye is terrific. There's a confidence about her work. The sculptures she made have scarcely ever been seen publicly and are remarkable.</p> <p>Helen then invited me to go and make paintings in her studio in New York. I said, 'No, I'm not a painter.' My wife is the painter and I've always said, 'You do the paintings and I'll do the sculpture.' But Helen said, 'No, you've got to come to the studio.' So I went to New York and stayed in the Wales Hotel, which was little more than a doss- house uptown. I walked into to her studio on the first day and she said, 'Here is your assistant, there are your paints and your rolls of canvas. It's all yours' - amazingly generous. I said, 'Helen, I thought you'd be working here, too.' She came in occasionally and, when she did, she was wonderful.

It would be a terrible shame if the art goes out of art - and she's a real artist. \u0095 An exhibition of recent works on paper by Helen Frankenthaler is at the Bernard Jacobson Gallery, 14a Clifford Street, London W1 (020 7495 8575) until 28 June From an interview with the artist by Julia Brown in After Mountains and Sea: Frankenthaler 1956-59 (Guggenheim Museum Publications)",

      "body": "<p>Two days before midsummer last year, as a red dawn was nudging the City skyline, Timothy Baxter and his old friend Gabriel Cornish strolled from Tottenham Court Road down to Charing Cross and up the steps of Hungerford Bridge. They were both 24 and had known each other since early childhood. They had been brought up at the Sheen school in Putney and had gone on to Richmond College. They had kept in touch during their years at university and later, as they had started their careers. They were friends.</p> <p>That evening, after Baxter had spent an hour or so clattering about on his skateboard in the concrete caverns of the South Bank, they had walked into the West End for a drink at a bar in Leicester Square, before joining a group of friends to go clubbing in Charing Cross Road. Both men were at the beginning of their adult lives; Cornish was starting a career in the music business and had taken a job in sound engineering after completing a course at the south London College of Music. Baxter had read philosophy at Manchester University and was due to enrol at law school in the coming September.</p> <p>Neither was flush and that evening they had eked out their drinks while they sat and relaxed in that aimless way students have. Then, happy and relaxed, chatting and oblivious to their surroundings, they decided to walk back to Baxter's mother's home on the South Bank. It was a warm night and the river was quiet. One or two late-night taxis cruised up and down the Embankment and, up river, lorries loaded with fruit and vegetables rolled across the bridges and into the market at Nine Elms. In those moments before the dawn of a summer day, London was at its most placid.</p> <p>At the same time as Baxter and Cornish stepped on to the north end of Hungerford Bridge, three men, Sonni Reid, John Riches and a 14-year-old boy who we must refer to as Juvenile A, had swung out of the Waterloo Embankment and on to the southern end of the bridge where it joins the walkways of the Royal Festival Hall.</p> <p>Reid, high on alcohol and cannabis, was 18 and homeless; Riches, 6'4\" and 21 years old, had been making his living by casually stealing whatever he could get his hands on. The juvenile, the third member of the pack, was experienced in the ways of the street. He had form - theft, assault and attempted burglary and an attitude loaded with contempt for everyone he met.</p> <p>None of the three had been clubbing or sitting chatting with friends, their educational accomplishments were minimal and they had few loyalties - other than to themselves. They were as at home in the London night as Cornish and Baxter were not and their hunting ground, which they had come to know like the backs of their hands, was the fertile alleyways and streets of London's Theatreland and the Thames Embankment.</p> <p>As Baxter and Cornish reached the centre of the narrow metal span which runs alongside the train tracks from Charing Cross station to the South Bank, three more figures followed them on to the bridge from the north. They were a girl of 16 [Juvenile C] and a 17-year-old [Juvenile B] - a short, thick-set boy from Woolwich. They were in the company of Cameron Cyrus, a loose-limbed and imposing 6'3\" 19-year-old.</p> <p>So it was as if the fates had conspired to lead two young men, with their lives before them, smiling into the jaws of danger. As Baxter and Cornish met the first trio in the middle of the bridge, the two young men were confronted and attacked. Baxter was carrying his skateboard, a prized possession, but had no money to speak of.</p> <p>'You've got the wrong people,' he said. 'We have nothing, leave us alone.' A few moments later, Cyrus and his two companions appeared. Cornish turned to them, pleading for help. The request fell on deaf ears. Their attackers took the skateboard and threw it over the parapet; then they took Baxter's glasses and threw them over as well.</p> <p>Nobody will ever know exactly what happened on Hungerford Bridge that night. After discovering that Baxter and Cornish were telling the truth and that neither man had any money, some of the group attacked them. They beat them to the ground and then they kicked them in the face and stamped on their heads. We know that Cornish was attacked by Juvenile A, who had demanded the silver chain from his wrist. 'I refused to give it to him,' Cornish said later. 'It was a present from my parents.' But A attacked him and in minutes Cornish and Baxter were lying bleeding on the metal footway of the bridge.</p> <p>Juvenile A then encouraged the others to take the two men and throw them into the river. They lifted Baxter, walked him to the parapet and dropped him into the Thames, which was in full flood. Then they did the same to Cornish. It was as if they perpetrated this sort of crime every day of the year. Beat someone up and, when you've finished, throw them away. Because if they're dead, they can't do anything about it.</p> <p>There was no surveillance on the bridge, but all six seemed to realise that they could be picked up by the cameras as soon as they left it. After returning to the South Bank, Reid, Riches and Juvenile A decided to separate from the group and walked away on their own, returning to the north. Their work was not over for the night and within a few minutes they had robbed another young man, Matthew Reynolds, as he stood watching the sunrise on the Embankment. Riches and the juvenile had started to assault Reynolds but were dissuaded by Reid.</p> <p>Terrorised and angry, Reynolds had given up his wallet and a cigarette lighter and had then been left alone. After the three had left, on their way to Leicester Square, he went to the police and reported what had happened.</p> <p>Other pedestrians, alarmed at the aggressive behaviour of the three, also reported them and a patrol car eventually tracked them down in St Martin's Court, off Charing Cross Road, where Reid was amusing himself by doing press-ups on the pavement. Within an hour, the three youths were in custody at Charing Cross police station.</p> <p>The arrest was just another incident in a long and lively night of assaults, thefts, robberies, rapes and false alarms. After an hour in the cells, Reid, Riches and their young companion were processed and brought out of the custody suite on the ground floor of Charing Cross and into the fetid, claustrophobic interview rooms. Reynolds had made a statement and the three suspects were questioned about it individually without requesting the presence of a solicitor. In interview, Riches immediately blurted out that 'something had happened on the bridge' and the police had their first intimation that there had been a serious incident.</p> <p>Both boys had been concussed at the time they hit the river. Baxter had been badly beaten and never regained consciousness, but Cornish was more fortunate and the water seemed to have revived him. He can recollect little of what happened but, in a chilling moment during the subsequent trial, he described a vague memory in which he saw his friend standing on the river bank and waving. The image seems to have been a spur to his return to consciousness and to have helped to raise him from his concussion and give him some sort of control over his actions. He remembered seeing Big Ben as he drifted past and discovering that he was clutching his friend's rucksack, which gave him enough buoyancy to keep afloat.</p> <p>He was drifting on the tide and quickly reached Vauxhall Bridge, over half a mile up river from Charing Cross. He had tried three times to swim to the side, but was pushed back to the centre of the stream by the current. He started to shout and, for the first time that night, events began to go his way. He was spotted in the middle of the river and was finally pulled out by two off-duty police officers who threw him a life belt and dragged him to the bank. Taken to St Thomas's Hospital suffering from hypothermia and concussion, he was able to tell the police that his friend was also in the river.</p> <p>The River Police began a search, but it took more than 24 hours for the Thames to give up its victim. The police eventually found him lying drowned among the driftwood on a mud bank beneath the Oxo Tower. He had never regained consciousness and his body had been washed up and down the river on the tide. It was only then that the police knew for certain that a murder had been committed.</p> <p>The police investigation was given to the Central London Serious Crimes Group and was put under the command of Detective Chief Inspector Dave Shipperlee. He is one of a breed of successful modern policemen - neat, efficient, painstaking and remorseless. On his office notice board is a complex flow chart showing the intricacies of a murder investigation and the rules which must be followed by the police. Above it, half a dozen inquiry posters are pinned in a line.</p> <p>There was an inevitability about the progress of the police. The lonely walkways of the South Bank and the streets around Theatreland are bristling with CCTV cameras and, armed with information from Cornish, Shipperlee commandeered all the relevant CCTV film from the South Bank and Charing Cross and began to analyse it. 'This may sound straightforward,' he said, 'but the police have only one facility for examining surveillance film - our laboratory at Denmark Hill, which is always very busy. Because Charing Cross station belongs to Railtrack, they turned to the British Transport Police for help. It took a long time to analyse the material.</p> <p>The six had split up and swapped clothes to alter their appearances, and Cyrus had done his best to avoid the cameras. But their efforts were half-hearted, as if they didn't really believe they had committed a terrible crime. The girl, Juvenile C, is seen holding hands and pecking her young companion's cheek as they leave the bridge. Cyrus and the two juveniles can be seen laughing and relaxed as they arrive at Waterloo Station at 4.45am and disappear on to a platform to catch an early-morning train back to south London. 'We knew who we wanted within a fortnight,' said Shipperlee, 'and then it was just a matter of old-fashioned policing.'</p> <p>The Serious Crimes Group deployed 20 police officers on the investigation and, within a month, had arrested all six suspects. Juvenile C, the last to be picked up, was detained on 16 July.</p> <p>The trial started in November and lasted for six months. It was distinguished by a lack of clarity about what had actually happened on the bridge and by a consequent tendency to lump all the defendants together as a gang. The accused, three of whom were under 18, were no more than children - albeit children who had been present when a murder had taken place and who had either colluded in it or failed to do anything to prevent it. They were charged on a number of counts, the most serious of which were the murder of Timothy Baxter and the attempted murder of Gabriel Cornish.</p> <p>Retribution came in the shape of Judge Anne Goddard QC and the Crown Prosecution led by Treasury Counsel Jonathan Laidlaw in number 11 court at the Old Bailey. The defendants sat in a long dock between 'custody officers' - there to keep them apart because their defence strategies were, without exception, to blame each other for what happened. Early on in the trial, Riches had appeared in the dock with bruises on his face, the result of an attack by Juvenile A because of his admission to the police that there had been an 'incident on the bridge'.</p> <p>The Old Bailey is a daunting experience for a teenager out of his or her m\u00e9tier. There were no fewer than 13 barristers in their wigs present in the well of the court, plus numerous solicitors, probation officers and the press. The public gallery was frequently full with relatives and members of the public keen to catch a glimpse of the perpetrators of this dreadful crime.</p> <p>Judge Goddard QC has a formidable aspect and sports a larger than usual wig clamped to the sides of her head with the arms of a pair of extra-wide glasses over which she casts a baleful stare. She is known for the severity of her sentencing.</p> <p>In the cold light of Central Criminal Court, the defendants seemed a miserable bunch. The oldest, at 21, was John W Riches, who was known as JonJon in Leicester Square. His mother had abandoned him as a child and he suffered from acute dyslexia. He had been educated without much success at a special school and had spent most of his youth caring for his father, who was paralysed and confined to bed after a stroke. Riches had a conviction for arson, having set fire to his father's bed after he died. The day before the incident on the bridge, Riches's five-year-old daughter Amy had been killed in a road accident.</p> <p>In evidence, he said of the death of Baxter: 'They picked the guy up and walked him to the railings. He was looking at me asking me to stop them. He said: \"Don't let your mates do this.\" He looked straight into my eyes. And then they threw him over.' After his arrest, Riches was the only member of the gang to show any concern when he told the police what had happened and then when he repeated it later to the police doctor.</p> <p>Sonni L Reid is 20 years old, homeless and originally from Forest Hill in south London but, in recent times, had been a haunter of hostels and street doorways in the West End. Like Riches, his father was disabled and he had spent much of his youth caring for his family. On the day of the murder, Reid had been smoking ganja and drinking brandy and strong beer in Leicester Square. It was in this brash, brassy playground populated by tourists and the dispossessed that he had come across Riches and joined with him for the night. After the ghastly events on the bridge, he had intervened during the robbery against Reynolds to prevent his companions from physically attacking him.</p> <p>The third member of the pack which set upon Baxter and Cornish, was Juvenile A, a lost soul in a city of lost souls, now a 15-year-old boy who seemed worthy of no commendation for anything, even from his barrister. In the flesh he is a slight figure with a mop of unruly black hair and a pronounced widow's peak. He had grown a small goatee beard since his arrest and had lived with his mother and sisters in the crumbling, grey necropolis of the Aylesbury Estate in Camberwell. But that summer he could more often have been found sleeping rough in the alleyways of Charing Cross and the Tottenham Court Road. He had already robbed a drunk of \u00a340 in the arches below Waterloo and during the remainder of the evening, had been busy drinking his way through the money. He said in evidence: 'I don't need to rob, I do it for the buzz.'</p> <p>Cameron Cyrus was a different kettle of fish. He had refused to speak during the interviews after his arrest and had, according to the prosecution and the police, obviously listened to what his barrister, Helena Kennedy QC, had to say and was difficult to cross-examine. Jonathan Laidlaw for the prosecution finally managed to unsettle him by producing a letter which Cyrus had written to Juvenile B. Cyrus had claimed B was an instigator of the violence.</p> <p>Cyrus also had form - taking and driving away, handling stolen goods, burglary, assault. In evidence, he told the court about his life in a loving family which had fallen apart when his parents separated and he had gone to live with his grandmother. He had been forced to leave this second home after a relative was taken ill. Cyrus had nowhere to go, but he was able, during his troubles, to pass seven GCSEs and had had the offer of a course in computer technology at the South London University. But he was now a teenager from a broken home and he made a break for it. 'I'm bored,' he said, and that was it.</p> <p>His two companions, Juveniles B and C, now 16, had been lovers until the day before the murder when the girl had ended the relationship. B, another child of the streets, had been dressed in designer clothes bought for him by his single mother, who 'liked him to look good'. Like the others on Hungerford Bridge, he had a criminal record, although, in common with his companions, he had never been imprisoned or even received a community service order. He had, in 1997, been given a conditional discharge for threatening behaviour and was later made the subject of a two-year supervision order for convictions of robbery, affray and assault.</p> <p>The girl, Juvenile C, the recent lover of the second juvenile in the group and before that, of Cameron Cyrus, is a pretty 16-year-old. It seems to be a clich\u00e9, but like the others, she comes from a broken home and left school when she was 14, saying she had problems with her stepfather. She had claimed to the police that she had been raped, kidnapped and held hostage for three days, but withdrew the allegations almost immediately. She was a habitu\u00e9 of Leicester Square and had spent most of the previous four days hanging around the area.</p> <p>The trial was a long and complicated affair in which the accused were cross-examined not only by the Crown but also by counsel for the other defendants. Their performance in the witness box was distinguished by a blankness of expression which appeared to some of those watching to be an arrogance which was almost a manifestation of evil. I felt, however, that in most cases it was a sign of immaturity and fear from children who were unable to deal with the situation they found themselves in and whose answer was to bring down the shutters as a defence.</p> <p>When it was all over, the jury brought in the inevitable verdict of guilty and all six were remanded for a month for reports. On 19 May they returned to the court where, before they were marched into the dock, there was a carnival atmosphere. The 13 wigs were bobbing about laughing and cracking jokes with their colleagues. The benches were bulging with solicitors, probation officers and social workers. The media were there in force and the public gallery was full; 32 family members sat looking blankly at the bear pit below them. The families of the victims were there, too, silent, mystified and protected by the police.</p> <p>On the morning of the 19th, the pleas for mitigation lasted for two hours and Judge Anne Goddard QC retired to consider her sentences for the final time at 1pm. By two o'clock there was a crowd outside the court and the little man in black tights and starched jabot from the Lord Mayor's dining room on the fifth floor, accompanied by a couple of suits who had expressed an interest in being there at the death, were waiting to enter the court.</p> <p>The judge was 10 minutes late and the six convicted defendants were brought up 30 seconds before she walked in. She immediately started to read out her decisions. 'Nobody will ever know precisely what happened on that bridge,' she said. 'The grief of Timothy Baxter's family cannot be measured.' And she read out the sentences one by one. 'Life, detained at her Majesty's pleasure, 16 years on count two [manslaughter]' and on it went.</p> <p>I watched the gallery as the relatives of the defendants clutched each other and wept, I watched C, the girl, looking round at the men in wigs and the stern judge and begin to weep, and I watched A as he scowled and then, as he left the dock, screaming at the judge: 'All yous suck out your fuckin' mothers.' Someone in the gallery screamed; another shouted, 'It was you lot should have drowned.' Then it was over.</p> <p>Afterwards I talked to Helena Kennedy, Cameron Cyrus's QC. 'We'll never know what happened that night,' she said. 'It seems inexplicable. I believe there was a group dynamic which forced them to do what they did. Peer pressure and a boy shouting \"throw them in the river\" was enough to create an atmosphere in which there was no going back. It will have been one person who started it and the others would have followed like sheep.'</p> <p>We may never know what really happened that night. Baxter's murder and Cornish's assault were terrible crimes. But the waste of six young lives is a dreadful tragedy. The severity of the judge's sentences for manslaughter of up to 16 years means that her recommended tariff to the Home Secretary in respect of the length of time to be served for the murder will almost certainly be equally severe.</p> <p>It is impossible to believe that they are all evil. Perhaps, if one could be confident that they would eventually be regurgitated from the prison service as better citizens and that their incarceration would have positive benefits, it would be more acceptable. Some hope.</p>",

Both men were at the beginning of their adult lives; Cornish was starting a career in the music business and had taken a job in sound engineering after completing a course at the south London College of Music.

After returning to the South Bank, Reid, Riches and Juvenile A decided to separate from the group and walked away on their own, returning to the north. Their work was not over for the night and within a few minutes they had robbed another young man, Matthew Reynolds, as he stood watching the sunrise on the Embankment. Riches and the juvenile had started to assault Reynolds but were dissuaded by Reid. Terrorised and angry, Reynolds had given up his wallet and a cigarette lighter and had then been left alone. After the three had left, on their way to Leicester Square, he went to the police and reported what had happened. Other pedestrians, alarmed at the aggressive behaviour of the three, also reported them and a patrol car eventually tracked them down in St Martin's Court, off Charing Cross Road, where Reid was amusing himself by doing press-ups on the pavement.

Early on in the trial, Riches had appeared in the dock with bruises on his face, the result of an attack by Juvenile A because of his admission to the police that there had been an 'incident on the bridge'. The Old Bailey is a daunting experience for a teenager out of his or her m\u00e9tier. There were no fewer than 13 barristers in their wigs present in the well of the court, plus numerous solicitors, probation officers and the press. The public gallery was frequently full with relatives and members of the public keen to catch a glimpse of the perpetrators of this dreadful crime. Judge Goddard QC has a formidable aspect and sports a larger than usual wig clamped to the sides of her head with the arms of a pair of extra-wide glasses over which she casts a baleful stare. She is known for the severity of her sentencing. In the cold light of Central Criminal Court, the defendants seemed a miserable bunch. The oldest, at 21, was John W Riches, who was known as JonJon in Leicester Square. His mother had abandoned him as a child and he suffered from acute dyslexia. He had been educated without much success at a special school and had spent most of his youth caring for his father, who was paralysed and confined to bed after a stroke. Riches had a conviction for arson, having set fire to his father's bed after he died. The day before the incident on the bridge, Riches's five-year-old daughter Amy had been killed in a road accident. In evidence, he said of the death of Baxter: 'They picked the guy up and walked him to the railings. He was looking at me asking me to stop them. He said: \"Don't let your mates do this.\" He looked straight into my eyes. And then they threw him over.' After his arrest, Riches was the only member of the gang to show any concern when he told the police what had happened and then when he repeated it later to the police doctor. Sonni L Reid is 20 years old, homeless and originally from Forest Hill in south London but, in recent times, had been a haunter of hostels and street doorways in the West End. Like Riches, his father was disabled and he had spent much of his youth caring for his family. On the day of the murder, Reid had been smoking ganja and drinking brandy and strong beer in Leicester Square. It was in this brash, brassy playground populated by tourists and the dispossessed that he had come across Riches and joined with him for the night. After the ghastly events on the bridge, he had intervened during the robbery against Reynolds to prevent his companions from physically attacking him. The third member of the pack which set upon Baxter and Cornish, was Juvenile A, a lost soul in a city of lost souls, now a 15-year-old boy who seemed worthy of no commendation for anything, even from his barrister. In the flesh he is a slight figure with a mop of unruly black hair and a pronounced widow's peak. He had grown a small goatee beard since his arrest and had lived with his mother and sisters in the crumbling, grey necropolis of the Aylesbury Estate in Camberwell. But that summer he could more often have been found sleeping rough in the alleyways of Charing Cross and the Tottenham Court Road. He had already robbed a drunk of \u00a340 in the arches below Waterloo and during the remainder of the evening, had been busy drinking his way through the money. He said in evidence: 'I don't need to rob, I do it for the buzz.' Cameron Cyrus was a different kettle of fish. He had refused to speak during the interviews after his arrest and had, according to the prosecution and the police, obviously listened to what his barrister, Helena Kennedy QC, had to say and was difficult to cross-examine. Jonathan Laidlaw for the prosecution finally managed to unsettle him by producing a letter which Cyrus had written to Juvenile B. Cyrus had claimed B was an instigator of the violence. Cyrus also had form - taking and driving away, handling stolen goods, burglary, assault. In evidence, he told the court about his life in a loving family which had fallen apart when his parents separated and he had gone to live with his grandmother. He had been forced to leave this second home after a relative was taken ill. Cyrus had nowhere to go, but he was able, during his troubles, to pass seven GCSEs and had had the offer of a course in computer technology at the South London University. But he was now a teenager from a broken home and he made a break for it. 'I'm bored,' he said, and that was it. His two companions, Juveniles B and C, now 16, had been lovers until the day before the murder when the girl had ended the relationship. B, another child of the streets, had been dressed in designer clothes bought for him by his single mother, who 'liked him to look good'. Like the others on Hungerford Bridge, he had a criminal record, although, in common with his companions, he had never been imprisoned or even received a community service order. He had, in 1997, been given a conditional discharge for threatening behaviour and was later made the subject of a two-year supervision order for convictions of robbery, affray and assault. The girl, Juvenile C, the recent lover of the second juvenile in the group and before that, of Cameron Cyrus, is a pretty 16-year-old. It seems to be a clich\u00e9, but like the others, she comes from a broken home and left school when she was 14, saying she had problems with her stepfather. She had claimed to the police that she had been raped, kidnapped and held hostage for three days, but withdrew the allegations almost immediately. She was a habitu\u00e9 of Leicester Square and had spent most of the previous four days hanging around the area. The trial was a long and complicated affair in which the accused were cross-examined not only by the Crown but also by counsel for the other defendants. Their performance in the witness box was distinguished by a blankness of expression which appeared to some of those watching to be an arrogance which was almost a manifestation of evil. I felt, however, that in most cases it was a sign of immaturity and fear from children who were unable to deal with the situation they found themselves in and whose answer was to bring down the shutters as a defence. When it was all over, the jury brought in the inevitable verdict of guilty and all six were remanded for a month for reports. On 19 May they returned to the court where, before they were marched into the dock, there was a carnival atmosphere. The 13 wigs were bobbing about laughing and cracking jokes with their colleagues. The benches were bulging with solicitors, probation officers and social workers. The media were there in force and the public gallery was full; 32 family members sat looking blankly at the bear pit below them. The families of the victims were there, too, silent, mystified and protected by the police. On the morning of the 19th, the pleas for mitigation lasted for two hours and Judge Anne Goddard QC retired to consider her sentences for the final time at 1pm. By two o'clock there was a crowd outside the court and the little man in black tights and starched jabot from the Lord Mayor's dining room on the fifth floor, accompanied by a couple of suits who had expressed an interest in being there at the death, were waiting to enter the court. The judge was 10 minutes late and the six convicted defendants were brought up 30 seconds before she walked in. She immediately started to read out her decisions. 'Nobody will ever know precisely what happened on that bridge,' she said. 'The grief of Timothy Baxter's family cannot be measured.' And she read out the sentences one by one. 'Life, detained at her Majesty's pleasure, 16 years on count two [manslaughter]' and on it went. I watched the gallery as the relatives of the defendants clutched each other and wept, I watched C, the girl, looking round at the men in wigs and the stern judge and begin to weep, and I watched A as he scowled and then, as he left the dock, screaming at the judge: 'All yous suck out your fuckin' mothers.' Someone in the gallery screamed; another shouted, 'It was you lot should have drowned.' Then it was over. Afterwards I talked to Helena Kennedy, Cameron Cyrus's QC. 'We'll never know what happened that night,' she said. 'It seems inexplicable. I believe there was a group dynamic which forced them to do what they did. Peer pressure and a boy shouting \"throw them in the river\" was enough to create an atmosphere in which there was no going back. It will have been one person who started it and the others would have followed like sheep.' We may never know what really happened that night. Baxter's murder and Cornish's assault were terrible crimes. But the waste of six young lives is a dreadful tragedy. The severity of the judge's sentences for manslaughter of up to 16 years means that her recommended tariff to the Home Secretary in respect of the length of time to be served for the murder will almost certainly be equally severe. It is impossible to believe that they are all evil. Perhaps, if one could be confident that they would eventually be regurgitated from the prison service as better citizens and that their incarceration would have positive benefits, it would be more acceptable. Some hope.",

      "body": "<p>'Yearning', she says. 'As a child I was always full of yearning.' For a home, stability, a settled sense of love; for children of her own (from the age of three, she used to dream up names for the son and daughter she wanted: Lancelot and Eloise were favoured). Now, in her mid-thirties, Esther Freud has found all these things - though the son and daughter are called Albie and Anna. Yet, still the novels that she writes are full of that sense of longing. I can think of no other writer who is so haunted by childhood, and who so authentically and unpatronisingly shows what it is like to be young, helpless, eager, vulnerable, resilient, awash with inarticulate needs. </p> <p>Esther Freud, who was in her twenties when her first novel, the autobiographical Hideous Kinky, was published, has had from the very beginning her own charismatic voice: candid, lucid, unflashy, with a freshness and a sweetness about it. Much like her own voice when you meet her, light-timbred, fluent. Or her face - small, mobile, interested, with huge murk-green eyes. Which is only one side of the story, of course, for the sunshine and sanity she presents is the pleasant surface that lies over darker things. This is only to be expected from her background. Her father is the disturbing painter Lucian Freud. Her great-grandfather is Sigmund. Her sister is Bella Freud the designer; her cousins include Emma and Matthew Freud; her uncle is Clement. </p> <p>She remembers picking up a copy of Time Out once, intrigued by the cover line, '100 Things We Love to Hate', only to find that one of them was 'anyone called Freud'. She has numerous half-siblings, some discovered only recently. She led a peripatetic girlhood, dragged off to Morocco after her hippy mother, wearing a red silk kaftan and longing for an acrylic jumper, breathing in exotic spices and dreaming of cornflakes. Family history breathes down her neck. Her name tags her. Her childhood dogs her. She grew up feeling that her life was extraordinary, while she herself was quite ordinary. This tension - between excitement and security; safety and adventure - tightens all of her fiction. </p> <p>Her latest book, The Wild, is about step-families. 'I have always known I would write about extended families,' she says, sitting in a caf\u00e9 near Hampstead Heath, drinking tea and apple juice. Single father William - teacher by day, and in his spare time handyman, woodcutter, cook, singer and dancer, organiser of domestic adventures, insister upon cheerfulness - has three daughters. Single mother Francine, with her children Tess and Jake, rents rooms from him. We know at once that this is not a story of happy families, for the opening pages describe a violent scene towards which the rest of the novel then works its way, and which fills its pages with dread. Scenes that are ostensibly cheerful fall into the shadows. A starting point for The Wild was, says Esther Freud, a sentence: 'We are living in a really brilliant house' - very spooky when the reader knows from the beginning that the house is also a house of domestic horror. Another starting point was the character of Tess, nine years old, needy, clumsy, diligent, hopeful, imaginative, plain. She wets her bed, night after night: her shameful secret. She writes bright letters to her absent father. She adores William, spaniel-like. 'He fills up her entire vision,' says Esther Freud, 'while William, he has all sorts of things in his life, and right out of the corner of his eye, every so often, he'll glimpse her small figure.' </p> <p>She loves him with a passion; he scarcely notices her, and when he does it is with irritation. William, who provides the other main narrative point of view, is a sinister version of the New Man, except his creator has some sympathy for him: 'There's a certain kind of man I hate - the one who makes himself king of a very small kingdom. I know William's a monster. But I didn't want to write a didactic book. And I also know what it's like to be alone in a house full of children. Everyone howling. You can't escape. He wants to be this perfect father.' Instead he becomes like the leader of a cult where everyone has to smile and be happy. </p> <p>Esther Freud is candid about using the events of her own life and the life of her extended family in her novels - Hideous Kinky was followed by Peerless Flats and Gaglow. 'I am amazed how ruthless I am,' she says. 'I don't think of myself like that. But if it works, I feel compelled by it. I tell myself I'll worry later. People go \"God! I would have waited until everyone concerned was dead\". But I can't wait.' </p> <p>As a child, she was always telling stories (just like Tess does in The Wild), and she says that she has always 'hoarded' her past, anxious that she would forget it before she wrote it down and turned it into a narrative, her fictional version. 'My secrets and fears were so huge,' she says. She plucks a memory from her store for me, one that has stayed with her. 'I was seven, maybe eight, and was on my way to Scotland to see a friend and on the way we stopped off to visit my father. He gave me a chocolate shoe, it was full of chocolates. I was SO delighted. I arrived in Scotland and unwrapped it and I suddenly remembered that I don't like chocolate. I kept it for years and years and couldn't eat it and couldn't throw it away and couldn't forget how much it hurt.' She gives a little chuckle at the self she was - and yet this chocolate shoe (which in The Wild becomes a chocolate pig that her absent father gives Tess) could stand as a kind of emblem of the way Esther Freud treats her past: never throwing it away, hoarding it, compelled by it. </p> <p>Tess is a bed-wetter. Esther Freud used to wet the bed herself. She remembers it as 'a secret you hold on to and it takes over. It becomes this huge thing. There's the fear of being judged, being found out. I thought I was the only person in the world who wet my bed.' It's those things that stung and haunted her which then turn up in her novels. </p> <p>'Writing freed me from the past,' she says. 'I think I used to live in the past, and in the future. I was strangely unconnected to the present. It showed in the way I was always locking myself out of the house, say, or I'd suddenly find I was on the underground on my way to Cockfosters, not the other line. In a way, when I wrote Hideous Kinky , I stopped having to think so much about the past. I had always worried that if I forgot it, then no one would know what had happened to us. I felt my past was what was interesting about me. I was invisible, really, and only my past made me special and glamorous. I would look in the mirror and see a normal-looking girl. My background didn't show in my face. I wanted to be different, at the same time that I so wanted to be the same as everyone else. I always felt I was watched as a child, and I was watching ourselves as well. I was making everything into a story as it happened.' </p> <p>At the same time she felt herself freed from the past by writing it, she stopped worrying so much about her future by moving into it; taking possession of the life she wanted. 'I stopped acting (a profession which maybe always makes you feel a sense of yearning to be at the centre), and I wrote Hideous Kinky at about the same time as I met the right man,' she says. The right man is the fine actor David Morrissey. 'Now I'm in the family that I dreamed of all my life. I always, always wanted children and I was always scared I wouldn't have them. You know when you drop a coin in a fountain and make a wish? I would always wish for children. In fact, when I went to Legoland the other day and people were dropping coins in the fountain, I realised I didn't really have anything urgent to wish for any more. I'd like more children, but it wouldn't break my heart if I didn't, not like it would have broken my heart to not have any.' </p> <p>So in a way, Esther Freud feels she has arrived at the place she has been longing for all her upturned life. 'Being married, having children, it hasn't changed me that much. It's more, \"Oh yes, this is what I should be doing\". I don't feel, my God, what has happened to my life, the way some women do when they have children. I don't feel as if I've lost my freedom - I didn't feel that free before. I didn't feel a young, free, this-is-my-life person. I was too busy waiting for the right man, the children. I was longing too much for my future. Now that I've got it, I feel more liberated. I feel more special to myself now. In a way, I feel younger than I did when I was young.' She adds quite simply: 'I'm just so happy.' (In fact, she was so very, very happy after the birth of Albie, that after five days she asked the midwife if she was still on drugs.) </p> <p>Journalists who interview Esther Freud tend to call her 'composed'. More than once, people have compared her to a cat - and there is something enigmatic and graceful about her. She blinks and grins at this. 'I am very happy for people to think that. I've spent a long time practising.' She is, she says, a very private person - while plundering her private life for her stories. Confession only happens on the page. 'I never wanted people to know if I had a problem,' she says. 'Like my bed-wetting, all my secrets. I used to be amazed by girls at school who'd chat away about having abortions or whatever. Sometimes I would try to imitate that openness, but I just couldn't. Maybe I was worried, somehow, that if I told my secrets and fears they would become real - I would see in people's faces that I wasn't all right. But if no one knew, it may not be real.' As if things aren't real until they are turned into words, stories. </p> <p>She remembers being at some strange party for the launch of a pen. There was a handwriting expert there, and she and some friends queued up to have their writing analysed. 'My heart was thumping so. I asked my friends, \"Are you scared?\" and they just looked at me. \"Why on earth should we be scared?\" But I was scared. I didn't know what he would find out about me. I don't know if I was worried he would find something out I did know and was ashamed of, or something I didn't even know myself. He looked at my writing and said, \"You don't like people to know about you, do you?\" \"No!\" I squeaked. \"No!\" I suppose I fear I will be discovered as a fraud. Maybe acting made me feel that - but I'm sure it comes from my childhood. All those secrets.' </p> <p>Secrets are what she explores in her novels. She stands up to go, five foot three in her trainers, light-footed and slight. A girl with green eyes, a woman with her own voice. </p> <p>\u0095 To order The Wild for \u00a311.99 plus 99p p&amp;p, call Observer CultureShop on 0800 3168 171.</p>",

Which is only one side of the story, of course, for the sunshine and sanity she presents is the pleasant surface that lies over darker things. This is only to be expected from her background. Her father is the disturbing painter Lucian Freud. Her great-grandfather is Sigmund. Her sister is Bella Freud the designer; her cousins include Emma and Matthew Freud; her uncle is Clement. She remembers picking up a copy of Time Out once, intrigued by the cover line, '100 Things We Love to Hate', only to find that one of them was 'anyone called Freud'. She has numerous half-siblings, some discovered only recently. She led a peripatetic girlhood, dragged off to Morocco after her hippy mother, wearing a red silk kaftan and longing for an acrylic jumper, breathing in exotic spices and dreaming of cornflakes. Family history breathes down her neck. Her name tags her. Her childhood dogs her. She grew up feeling that her life was extraordinary, while she herself was quite ordinary. This tension - between excitement and security; safety and adventure - tightens all of her fiction. Her latest book, The Wild, is about step-families. 'I have always known I would write about extended families,' she says, sitting in a caf\u00e9 near Hampstead Heath, drinking tea and apple juice. Single father William - teacher by day, and in his spare time handyman, woodcutter, cook, singer and dancer, organiser of domestic adventures, insister upon cheerfulness - has three daughters. Single mother Francine, with her children Tess and Jake, rents rooms from him. We know at once that this is not a story of happy families, for the opening pages describe a violent scene towards which the rest of the novel then works its way, and which fills its pages with dread. Scenes that are ostensibly cheerful fall into the shadows. A starting point for The Wild was, says Esther Freud, a sentence: 'We are living in a really brilliant house' - very spooky when the reader knows from the beginning that the house is also a house of domestic horror. Another starting point was the character of Tess, nine years old, needy, clumsy, diligent, hopeful, imaginative, plain. She wets her bed, night after night: her shameful secret. She writes bright letters to her absent father. She adores William, spaniel-like. 'He fills up her entire vision,' says Esther Freud, 'while William, he has all sorts of things in his life, and right out of the corner of his eye, every so often, he'll glimpse her small figure.' She loves him with a passion; he scarcely notices her, and when he does it is with irritation. William, who provides the other main narrative point of view, is a sinister version of the New Man, except his creator has some sympathy for him: 'There's a certain kind of man I hate - the one who makes himself king of a very small kingdom. I know William's a monster. But I didn't want to write a didactic book. And I also know what it's like to be alone in a house full of children. Everyone howling. You can't escape. He wants to be this perfect father.' Instead he becomes like the leader of a cult where everyone has to smile and be happy. Esther Freud is candid about using the events of her own life and the life of her extended family in her novels - Hideous Kinky was followed by Peerless Flats and Gaglow. 'I am amazed how ruthless I am,' she says. 'I don't think of myself like that. But if it works, I feel compelled by it. I tell myself I'll worry later. People go \"God! I would have waited until everyone concerned was dead\". But I can't wait.' As a child, she was always telling stories (just like Tess does in The Wild), and she says that she has always 'hoarded' her past, anxious that she would forget it before she wrote it down and turned it into a narrative, her fictional version. 'My secrets and fears were so huge,' she says. She plucks a memory from her store for me, one that has stayed with her. 'I was seven, maybe eight, and was on my way to Scotland to see a friend and on the way we stopped off to visit my father. He gave me a chocolate shoe, it was full of chocolates. I was SO delighted. I arrived in Scotland and unwrapped it and I suddenly remembered that I don't like chocolate. I kept it for years and years and couldn't eat it and couldn't throw it away and couldn't forget how much it hurt.' She gives a little chuckle at the self she was - and yet this chocolate shoe (which in The Wild becomes a chocolate pig that her absent father gives Tess) could stand as a kind of emblem of the way Esther Freud treats her past: never throwing it away, hoarding it, compelled by it. Tess is a bed-wetter. Esther Freud used to wet the bed herself. She remembers it as 'a secret you hold on to and it takes over. It becomes this huge thing. There's the fear of being judged, being found out. I thought I was the only person in the world who wet my bed.' It's those things that stung and haunted her which then turn up in her novels. 'Writing freed me from the past,' she says. 'I think I used to live in the past, and in the future. I was strangely unconnected to the present. It showed in the way I was always locking myself out of the house, say, or I'd suddenly find I was on the underground on my way to Cockfosters, not the other line. In a way, when I wrote Hideous Kinky , I stopped having to think so much about the past. I had always worried that if I forgot it, then no one would know what had happened to us. I felt my past was what was interesting about me. I was invisible, really, and only my past made me special and glamorous. I would look in the mirror and see a normal-looking girl. My background didn't show in my face. I wanted to be different, at the same time that I so wanted to be the same as everyone else. I always felt I was watched as a child, and I was watching ourselves as well. I was making everything into a story as it happened.' At the same time she felt herself freed from the past by writing it, she stopped worrying so much about her future by moving into it; taking possession of the life she wanted. 'I stopped acting (a profession which maybe always makes you feel a sense of yearning to be at the centre), and I wrote Hideous Kinky at about the same time as I met the right man,' she says. The right man is the fine actor David Morrissey. 'Now I'm in the family that I dreamed of all my life. I always, always wanted children and I was always scared I wouldn't have them. You know when you drop a coin in a fountain and make a wish? I would always wish for children. In fact, when I went to Legoland the other day and people were dropping coins in the fountain, I realised I didn't really have anything urgent to wish for any more. I'd like more children, but it wouldn't break my heart if I didn't, not like it would have broken my heart to not have any.' So in a way, Esther Freud feels she has arrived at the place she has been longing for all her upturned life. 'Being married, having children, it hasn't changed me that much. It's more, \"Oh yes, this is what I should be doing\". I don't feel, my God, what has happened to my life, the way some women do when they have children. I don't feel as if I've lost my freedom - I didn't feel that free before. I didn't feel a young, free, this-is-my-life person. I was too busy waiting for the right man, the children. I was longing too much for my future. Now that I've got it, I feel more liberated. I feel more special to myself now. In a way, I feel younger than I did when I was young.' She adds quite simply: 'I'm just so happy.' (In fact, she was so very, very happy after the birth of Albie, that after five days she asked the midwife if she was still on drugs.) Journalists who interview Esther Freud tend to call her 'composed'. More than once, people have compared her to a cat - and there is something enigmatic and graceful about her. She blinks and grins at this. 'I am very happy for people to think that. I've spent a long time practising.' She is, she says, a very private person - while plundering her private life for her stories. Confession only happens on the page. 'I never wanted people to know if I had a problem,' she says. 'Like my bed-wetting, all my secrets. I used to be amazed by girls at school who'd chat away about having abortions or whatever. Sometimes I would try to imitate that openness, but I just couldn't. Maybe I was worried, somehow, that if I told my secrets and fears they would become real - I would see in people's faces that I wasn't all right. But if no one knew, it may not be real.' As if things aren't real until they are turned into words, stories. She remembers being at some strange party for the launch of a pen. There was a handwriting expert there, and she and some friends queued up to have their writing analysed. 'My heart was thumping so. I asked my friends, \"Are you scared?\" and they just looked at me. \"Why on earth should we be scared?\" But I was scared. I didn't know what he would find out about me. I don't know if I was worried he would find something out I did know and was ashamed of, or something I didn't even know myself. He looked at my writing and said, \"You don't like people to know about you, do you?\" \"No!\" I squeaked. \"No!\" I suppose I fear I will be discovered as a fraud. Maybe acting made me feel that - but I'm sure it comes from my childhood. All those secrets.' Secrets are what she explores in her novels. She stands up to go, five foot three in her trainers, light-footed and slight. A girl with green eyes, a woman with her own voice. \u0095 To order The Wild for \u00a311.99 plus 99p p&amp;p, call Observer CultureShop on 0800 3168 171.",

      "body": "<p>It's been a long time since we saw Demi Moore. And it seems like longer, because for most of the Nineties she was inescapable, no matter where you hid. G.I. Jane, the last Demi Moore star vehicle, came out three years ago and was instantly notorious. There were think pieces about women in the military, Demi did one-armed push-ups on talk shows, the critics howled and there were was sheer incredulity at the fact that Demi actually shouts 'Suck my dick' in the movie. </p> <p>But that was the Nineties for Moore. Even if you didn't see any of her films, you couldn't avoid her, or - more specifically - her body. Those Vanity Fair covers, the Disclosure poster, the stories of implants and her work-out regime. Then there were the spurious debates: the Indecent Proposal issue about whether any woman was worth $1 million for one night, or the Disclosure question about whether women sexually harassed men. Not to mention the marriage to Bruce, the kids, and the stories about their overblown lifestyle. Even her name, which we all had to learn to say with the unexpected stress. And all the while, her wages went up, until she was the best paid actress in the world. </p> <p>And then it stopped. Maybe the ridicule that followed The Scarlet Letter, Striptease and G.I. Jane did it. Maybe she had just made enough money to take a break. Or maybe it was the final collapse of her marriage. Whatever the reason, after a surprisingly effective appearance in Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry, she went away. Her return is a curious one, free of the headline-grabbing bombast that we've come to expect. It's easy enough to see what she saw in Passion Of Mind: she gets to play both of the main characters. One is a widow living quietly in rural France, the other is a Manhattan career woman. One of them is dreaming the life of the other: the question is which is dream and which is reality. </p> <p>But the script - by Ron Bass, who wrote Rain Man and My Best Friend's Wedding - has been kicking around since 1985 when it was intended for Michelle Pfeiffer. These days Bass is so powerful that he was able to insist that his script couldn't be tampered with, even though he wasn't on set to help. The director Bass chose was Alain Berliner, whose debut, Ma Vie En Rose, a fantasy about a sexually confused little boy, won a Golden Globe for best foreign film. Moore's two leading men were hardly in the Michael Douglas bracket either: William Fitchner is an excellent character actor who normally plays bad guys, while Stellan Skarsg rd is a star in Scandinavia but not in Hollywood. The budget was $15 million, which would barely cover what Moore normally gets paid. But as anyone who has worked with slumming stars will tell you, it is not the money that causes problems. It's the working conditions. And so it was on Passion Of Mind, where it seemed that Moore's band of nannies and helpers wasn't much smaller than the crew itself. Berliner wasn't happy. He also had trouble with Moore's overly literal approach. 'Demi needs a lot of details,' he said. ' What created some misunderstandings is that the movie is like a dream - there's not always a logic.' Add the fact that the film sat on the shelf for nearly a year before finding a release date, and this is no triumphant comeback. But you can see what Moore was trying to do: scale back and make a film that would not be a target for critics. </p> <p>But of course, it was Moore who had put herself in the firing line in the first place. If you're looking for answers in a childhood, Moore's seems to have them all. She was born Demetria Guynes in 1962 in the appropriately infamous town of Roswell, New Mexico. She says that her family moved 30 times when she was young. And yes, they were poor. The man she grew up thinking was her father turned out not to be: he committed suicide when she was 15. She had two operations to correct a crossed right eye. She left school at 16, got married at 18 to a 30-year-old rock musician. Legend has it that it was their next-door neighbour, Natassja Kinski, who encouraged Demi to act. </p> <p>After some modelling - including some nude work - she got a part in General Hospital, then America's most popular daytime soap. Her new salary also allowed her to acquire a hefty coke habit, which lasted until she got her first big film role in St Elmo's Fire; director Joel Schumacher insisted that she go into rehab before playing a girl with a coke problem in the movie. </p> <p>If you want to know how powerful Moore's combination of will power and luck has been, look at the rest of the cast of St Elmo's Fire . They were the hottest young stars around: Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy and Ally Sheedy. Schumacher's overblown melodrama about a group of friends trying to come to grips with life after college was going to be their way out of teen movies into the big time. It might just be the definitive Eighties movie, complete with a bludgeoning, anthemic rock theme tune, Reaganite politics, coke and Rob Lowe playing the saxophone while wearing a bandanna. And perhaps because it was so firmly of its time, not to mention such a showcase of wretched overacting, only Moore would grow up to have an A-list career. </p> <p>But at the time, Moore was as Brat Pack as you could get. She shared a histrionic acting technique with Nelson. She went out with Estevez. She starred with Lowe in About Last Night (1986), a crude adaptation of David Mamet's play Sexual Perversity In Chicago, notable mainly for just how long Moore manages to be naked. But she broke with the clique when she split from Estevez and married Moonlighting star Bruce Willis. Then he made Die Hard and surprised everyone by becoming an action star. </p> <p>And then Demi got lucky too. Ghost was one of those hits nobody saw coming. It was only meant to be a medium-sized movie in every way, a quiet bit of slush. But it took off, and made Demi - shorn of her big hair for the new decade - famous when her contemporaries were fading. At which point, her talent for self-promotion took over when she posed, nude and pregnant, for the cover of Vanity Fair. No actor and magazine have ever been as entwined as Demi was with Vanity Fair. 'I'm sure there are a lot of people who think I'm a bitch,' she was willing to confess. As the decade went on, the hits (A Few Good Men, Indecent Proposal) mixed with the flops (The Butcher's Wife, Now And Then) but it wasn't until The Scarlet Letter (1995) that things seemed to be going wrong. Sure, the film was a disaster, a terrible idea from the start, but it was Moore, rather than director Roland Joffe or anyone else, who took the blame. The same happened with Striptease and G.I. Jane. It can't have helped that Moore was now getting paid more than any actress in history, at a time when the films just seemed worse and worse. </p> <p>Striptease was the nadir: far from the public demanding nudity, people felt Moore was imposing her increasingly weird, muscle-bound body on them. Like Madonna's behaviour a few years earlier, Moore's exhibitionism seemed to be less to do with sex than a kind of Nietzschean feminism. As Janet Maslin in the New York Times put it: 'These scenes suggest not unfettered sexuality but gruelling hard work: prodigious efforts by costumer, choreographer, make-up squad, work-out coach, maybe even the Army Corps of Engineers.' </p> <p>But Moore wasn't taking on board what the real criticisms were. 'There's this idea that if you take your clothes off, somehow you must have loose morals,' she said. 'There's still a negative attitude in our society towards women who use a strength that's inherent - their femininity - in any way that might be considered seductive.' Watching the film, seduction seemed the last thing on the agenda. But Striptease could have saved her. Far from being a Showgirls clone, it was based on a novel by the the satirical crime writer Carl Hiassen. With a pre-Boogie Nights Burt Reynolds playing a sleazy politician and Ving Rhames providing deft support, Striptease might have done for Moore what Out Of Sight did for George Clooney. But although director Andrew Bergman deserves some of the blame, it was Moore who seemed to have got the tone wrong. The rest of the cast knew it was a comedy, but Demi seemed to think it was all about one brave woman's struggle against the system... through stripping. </p> <p>Which makes the one thing she has got right recently more mysterious. Check the producer credits on the Austin Powers movies and her name appears. That's not the semi-symbolic role of executive producer: that's the normally hands-on job of producer. Maybe it means she has a sense of humour after all. Or maybe it just means that she still has good instincts, but can't use them for her own movies. Either way, if Moore is going to shake off the baggage of the Nineties as effectively as she did the Eighties Mike Myers would be a better ally than Ron Bass.

'But that day everything came together.

In that time, the conference and exhibition sector has become one of the most powerful drivers of the city's economy.

After 21 years of trying, Birmingham's NEC has finally clinched the world's biggest peripatetic trade event, the International Textile Machinery Association show.

      "body": "<p>Give me two good reasons why I should listen to some American tell me about the euro. </p> <p>All right. Number One: We don't care. There's no emotional baggage here. Frankly, I couldn't care less whether the Queen's nose remains on your coinage or not. </p> <p>Number Two: Americans invented the euro. And it's time you learnt why. </p> <p>In 1970, Professor Robert Mundell, now at New York's Columbia University, proposed the 'Europa', based on his theory of optimal currency areas. It won him the Nobel Prize. On the Continent, Mundell is dubbed 'father of the euro'. </p> <p>But in the US, he is best known for the other creation he spawned. To Americans, Mundell is 'father of Reaganomics', the supply-side monetarism and tear-down-the-government philosophy which is the heart, soul and agenda of the extreme free marketeers. </p> <p>Mundell was, even more than Milton Friedman, their leader. 'Ronald Reagan would not have been elected President without Mundell's influence,' wrote the Wall Street Journal's Jude Wanniski. </p> <p>Canadian-born Mundell is a clever and cohesive thinker. It would be impossible to accept one side of his coin - the euro - without accepting the flip side: supply-side economics. They're inseparable, like marriage and lies. </p> <p>Let's begin with Mundell in his own words. 'They won't even let me have a toilet,' he told me last week. Mundell has bought a castle in Tuscany. (Like many supply-side economists, he created prosperity, at least for himself.) </p> <p>His problem is that, to preserve the ancient structure, local officials won't let him simply rip out a couple of walls to put in a bath and WC. His point is this: 'Europe is over-regulated. Regulated to death.' </p> <p>There's more than plumbing on Mundell's long list of bureaucratic bugaboos. 'It's very hard to fire workers in Europe,' he complains. To solve such problems, Mundell conceived the euro. 'It puts monetary policy out of the reach of politicians.' </p> <p>Yet that does not seem the most direct route to eliminating government. Even defenders of monetary union argue that each nation will remain in control of fiscal policy. </p> <p> Oh no they won't , says Mundell: 'Monetary discipline forces fiscal discipline on the politicians as well.' The Maastricht rules, the conditions for entering the euro - limiting annual deficits to 3 per cent of GDP and total debt outstanding to 60 per cent - leave little room for active government. As Mundell explains it, Maastricht limitations mean individual nations will have nothing left to entice inward investment except lower tax rates and de-regulation. Governments will compete by shrinking. </p> <p>Wholesale privatisation is also, for Mundell, a predictable effect of monetary union. To meet the 60 per cent debt limitation, nations privatise infrastructure such as water or air traffic control.

      "bodyText": "Give me two good reasons why I should listen to some American tell me about the euro. All right. Number One: We don't care. There's no emotional baggage here. Frankly, I couldn't care less whether the Queen's nose remains on your coinage or not. Number Two: Americans invented the euro. And it's time you learnt why. In 1970, Professor Robert Mundell, now at New York's Columbia University, proposed the 'Europa', based on his theory of optimal currency areas. It won him the Nobel Prize. On the Continent, Mundell is dubbed 'father of the euro'. But in the US, he is best known for the other creation he spawned. To Americans, Mundell is 'father of Reaganomics', the supply-side monetarism and tear-down-the-government philosophy which is the heart, soul and agenda of the extreme free marketeers. Mundell was, even more than Milton Friedman, their leader. 'Ronald Reagan would not have been elected President without Mundell's influence,' wrote the Wall Street Journal's Jude Wanniski. Canadian-born Mundell is a clever and cohesive thinker. It would be impossible to accept one side of his coin - the euro - without accepting the flip side: supply-side economics. They're inseparable, like marriage and lies. Let's begin with Mundell in his own words. 'They won't even let me have a toilet,' he told me last week. Mundell has bought a castle in Tuscany. (Like many supply-side economists, he created prosperity, at least for himself.) His problem is that, to preserve the ancient structure, local officials won't let him simply rip out a couple of walls to put in a bath and WC. His point is this: 'Europe is over-regulated. Regulated to death.' There's more than plumbing on Mundell's long list of bureaucratic bugaboos. 'It's very hard to fire workers in Europe,' he complains. To solve such problems, Mundell conceived the euro. 'It puts monetary policy out of the reach of politicians.' Yet that does not seem the most direct route to eliminating government. Even defenders of monetary union argue that each nation will remain in control of fiscal policy. Oh no they won't , says Mundell: 'Monetary discipline forces fiscal discipline on the politicians as well.' The Maastricht rules, the conditions for entering the euro - limiting annual deficits to 3 per cent of GDP and total debt outstanding to 60 per cent - leave little room for active government. As Mundell explains it, Maastricht limitations mean individual nations will have nothing left to entice inward investment except lower tax rates and de-regulation. Governments will compete by shrinking. Wholesale privatisation is also, for Mundell, a predictable effect of monetary union. To meet the 60 per cent debt limitation, nations privatise infrastructure such as water or air traffic control. These asset sales don't affect the public's obligation to use these services, and the public still pays for them - but Maastricht is satisfied. John Maynard Keynes wrote: 'Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler a few years back.' Now, I would never suggest that Baroness (Shirley) Williams is either mad or in authority - nevertheless, as a fervent supporter of the euro, she could explain, I thought, why Britain and Greece meet the criteria for one of Mundell's optimal currency areas. The Lib-Dem peer had studied at Mundell's school. She told me she'd 'read lots and lots' on the euro but not much 'before the last 20 years', so missed Mundell. (Actually, Mundell won the Nobel only last year for continuing work.) What of Britain as optimal mate for euroland? She spoke of European tax and budget policies, though they have not a thing to do with reasons to meld currencies. I would not say that Professor Williams (she teaches at Harvard) was faking it, but it was clear there was no point asking her about the supply-side economics underpinning the euro's conception.

However, the US does not have a single currency, at least not in the Maastricht sense. We have at least 50 currencies. Each state, every little burg and hamlet, has its own tax and employment policy.

      "body": "<p>The bad boy of Russian business was at the Dorchester hotel in London last week for an image makeover. Multimillionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky was in town to tell an Investing in Russia conference that his oil company, Yukos, has put its poor corporate governance record behind it, and will soon issue internationally-traded shares (level 1 ADRs). </p> <p>Yukos, Russia's second-biggest oil producer returned to the Moscow stock market - which delisted it a year ago for regulatory offences - just in time for the visit. </p> <p>It is not just Yukos's record, or the spectacular crash in 1998 of Khodorkovsky's bank, Menatep, that have made him controversial. It is the belief, held by most Russians, that he belongs to a tiny group of 'oligarchs' who made their vast fortunes at the country's expense and wield tremendous political influence . </p> <p>Khodorkovsky said he only wished the belief about political influence was true. 'It makes me weep when Boris Berezovsky [the car-sales-to-oil-to-media magnate, perceived as the most powerful oligarch] talks about this group of people having 100 per cent political influence. If we had just 10 per cent of the political influence that Berezovsky claims, we would never have allowed the government to impose the unbearable tax burden on business that it has.' </p> <p>Shortly before Vladimir Putin was elected, Berezovsky claimed the oligarchs controlled Russian politics and the new President could not change that. But Khodorkovsky insists that Berezovsky is an exception: a politician-turned-businessman. The other oligarchs - such as himself, Vladimir Potanin, media mogul Vladimir Gusinsky, and banking-to-metals tycoon Mikhail Fridman - have political influence that is 'more visible than that of Western businessmen, but, unfortunately, less effective'. </p> <p>He added: 'I really don't see the difference, politically, between Yukos and General Motors. Both have about 2 per cent of [their country's] GDP. Both lobby in parliament for their interests. Both propagandise in the press.' </p> <p>James Fenkner, strategist at Troika Dialog, Russia's largest investment bank, agrees that the other oligarchs are 'not as omnipotent as Berezovsky', but says Khodorkovsky's wishes have an interesting habit of turning into government action. Fenkner cites as an example the appointment last year of Viktor Kaliuzhny, a former Yukos employee, as Energy Minister, and his subsequent dismissal after Khodorkovsky expressed displeasure. </p> <p>Khodorkovsky's main theme on his London visit - the need to reduce the tax burden on Russian business - coincides neatly with Putin's only clearly-stated economic policy. And the oil baron concurs with the former KGB spy in the Kremlin on the latter's moves to curtail the power of Russia's regional governors. </p> <p>Thirty-six-year-old Khodorkovsky's indignation at claims he has undue political influence is matched by his anger at suggestions that his wealth was ill-gotten. 'If a young American built a $30 million company in the space of three years, he would be applauded. If a young Russian does it, people say he could not have done without the help of the Communist Party.' </p> <p>Those three years of Khodorkovsky's early success were also the last three of the Soviet Union. He started in business in 1987, as a 23-year-old student at the Moscow Chemical Technology Institute and a member of the Communist youth organisation. </p> <p>Khodorkovsky founded Menatep bank in 1989 and it grew rapidly, sprouting Rosprom, an investment company managing more than 100 industrial enterprises. By 1995, Menatep was well positioned to take advantage of the notorious loans-for-shares scheme, under which banks that lent money to the cash-strapped government got state assets at bargain prices in return. </p> <p>International opinion held that state property was plundered. An International Monetary Fund analysis reckoned the oil assets went for less than one-tenth of their value. An analysis by two World Bank officials said favoured banks used state cash to fund bids, and concluded that 'any one of the major oil companies sold via a transparent, international tender would have yielded far more revenue than all the loans-for-shares auctions combined'. </p> <p>Menatep bought Yukos for what critics say was an absurdly low price. Khodorkovsky said: 'Yes, the price was low - $400m - but I was taking on $3 billion of debt. In east Germany they sold such companies for $1.' </p> <p>Under Khodorkovsky, Yukos pioneered the controversial transfer pricing system, under which his Moscow-based holding company buys oil from its production subsidiaries at fabulous discounts - currently $1.50 a barrel, a twentieth of the world price and a fifth of the domestic price - and resells it. This concentrates wealth in the holding company, weakens minority shareholders, and avoids tax. </p> <p>Khodorkovsky was robustly unapologetic. ' As long as the tax regime is unjust, I will try to find a way round it.' </p> <p>His worst problems stemmed from the Russian financial crash of 1998; Yukos kept up payments on $1bn of international loans but Menatep lost heavily on Russian treasury bonds and collapsed. Menatep defaulted on loans from three western banks - Daiwa, Standard and West Merchant - for which it had used Yukos stock as collateral. </p> <p>The banks took a 31.9 per cent holding in Yukos, but then found that some of the company's assets had been transferred to offshore funds, presumed to be linked to Yukos management, on a repurchase agreement. At the same time, minority shareholdings in Yukos's production subsidiaries were being diluted. </p> <p>Russia's securities regulator launched an investiga tion. Two of the three Western banks pulled out. Yukos's reputation was severely damaged. </p> <p>'I sat down with representatives of the three banks and explained the situation,' said Khodorkovsky. 'I assured them that they would retain seats on the board. Unfortunately two of the three decided to sell their holdings.' </p> <p>The banks that withdrew did so under the pressure of 'propaganda' by Kenneth Dart, the US investor who fought a legal battle over his rights as a shareholder in Yukos subsidiaries, Khodorkovsky believes. He pointed out: 'The company that I head, Yukos, takes its responsibilities. It has never failed to pay its debts and never diluted shareholders. At my own insistence, as a major shareholder, Yukos is committed to paying off all of Menatep's creditors.' </p> <p>While Yukos's victories in the courts implied that it had not broken the law, 'it has cer tainly violated shareholders' rights,' Fenkner of Troika said. 'There is a credibility gap.

      "bodyText": "The bad boy of Russian business was at the Dorchester hotel in London last week for an image makeover. Multimillionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky was in town to tell an Investing in Russia conference that his oil company, Yukos, has put its poor corporate governance record behind it, and will soon issue internationally-traded shares (level 1 ADRs). Yukos, Russia's second-biggest oil producer returned to the Moscow stock market - which delisted it a year ago for regulatory offences - just in time for the visit. It is not just Yukos's record, or the spectacular crash in 1998 of Khodorkovsky's bank, Menatep, that have made him controversial. It is the belief, held by most Russians, that he belongs to a tiny group of 'oligarchs' who made their vast fortunes at the country's expense and wield tremendous political influence . Khodorkovsky said he only wished the belief about political influence was true. 'It makes me weep when Boris Berezovsky [the car-sales-to-oil-to-media magnate, perceived as the most powerful oligarch] talks about this group of people having 100 per cent political influence. If we had just 10 per cent of the political influence that Berezovsky claims, we would never have allowed the government to impose the unbearable tax burden on business that it has.' Shortly before Vladimir Putin was elected, Berezovsky claimed the oligarchs controlled Russian politics and the new President could not change that. But Khodorkovsky insists that Berezovsky is an exception: a politician-turned-businessman. The other oligarchs - such as himself, Vladimir Potanin, media mogul Vladimir Gusinsky, and banking-to-metals tycoon Mikhail Fridman - have political influence that is 'more visible than that of Western businessmen, but, unfortunately, less effective'. He added: 'I really don't see the difference, politically, between Yukos and General Motors. Both have about 2 per cent of [their country's] GDP. Both lobby in parliament for their interests. Both propagandise in the press.' James Fenkner, strategist at Troika Dialog, Russia's largest investment bank, agrees that the other oligarchs are 'not as omnipotent as Berezovsky', but says Khodorkovsky's wishes have an interesting habit of turning into government action. Fenkner cites as an example the appointment last year of Viktor Kaliuzhny, a former Yukos employee, as Energy Minister, and his subsequent dismissal after Khodorkovsky expressed displeasure. Khodorkovsky's main theme on his London visit - the need to reduce the tax burden on Russian business - coincides neatly with Putin's only clearly-stated economic policy. And the oil baron concurs with the former KGB spy in the Kremlin on the latter's moves to curtail the power of Russia's regional governors. Thirty-six-year-old Khodorkovsky's indignation at claims he has undue political influence is matched by his anger at suggestions that his wealth was ill-gotten. 'If a young American built a $30 million company in the space of three years, he would be applauded. If a young Russian does it, people say he could not have done without the help of the Communist Party.' Those three years of Khodorkovsky's early success were also the last three of the Soviet Union. He started in business in 1987, as a 23-year-old student at the Moscow Chemical Technology Institute and a member of the Communist youth organisation. Khodorkovsky founded Menatep bank in 1989 and it grew rapidly, sprouting Rosprom, an investment company managing more than 100 industrial enterprises. By 1995, Menatep was well positioned to take advantage of the notorious loans-for-shares scheme, under which banks that lent money to the cash-strapped government got state assets at bargain prices in return. International opinion held that state property was plundered. An International Monetary Fund analysis reckoned the oil assets went for less than one-tenth of their value. An analysis by two World Bank officials said favoured banks used state cash to fund bids, and concluded that 'any one of the major oil companies sold via a transparent, international tender would have yielded far more revenue than all the loans-for-shares auctions combined'. Menatep bought Yukos for what critics say was an absurdly low price. Khodorkovsky said: 'Yes, the price was low - $400m - but I was taking on $3 billion of debt. In east Germany they sold such companies for $1.' Under Khodorkovsky, Yukos pioneered the controversial transfer pricing system, under which his Moscow-based holding company buys oil from its production subsidiaries at fabulous discounts - currently $1.50 a barrel, a twentieth of the world price and a fifth of the domestic price - and resells it. This concentrates wealth in the holding company, weakens minority shareholders, and avoids tax. Khodorkovsky was robustly unapologetic. ' As long as the tax regime is unjust, I will try to find a way round it.' His worst problems stemmed from the Russian financial crash of 1998; Yukos kept up payments on $1bn of international loans but Menatep lost heavily on Russian treasury bonds and collapsed. Menatep defaulted on loans from three western banks - Daiwa, Standard and West Merchant - for which it had used Yukos stock as collateral. The banks took a 31.9 per cent holding in Yukos, but then found that some of the company's assets had been transferred to offshore funds, presumed to be linked to Yukos management, on a repurchase agreement. At the same time, minority shareholdings in Yukos's production subsidiaries were being diluted. Russia's securities regulator launched an investiga tion. Two of the three Western banks pulled out. Yukos's reputation was severely damaged. 'I sat down with representatives of the three banks and explained the situation,' said Khodorkovsky. 'I assured them that they would retain seats on the board. Unfortunately two of the three decided to sell their holdings.' The banks that withdrew did so under the pressure of 'propaganda' by Kenneth Dart, the US investor who fought a legal battle over his rights as a shareholder in Yukos subsidiaries, Khodorkovsky believes. He pointed out: 'The company that I head, Yukos, takes its responsibilities. It has never failed to pay its debts and never diluted shareholders. At my own insistence, as a major shareholder, Yukos is committed to paying off all of Menatep's creditors.' While Yukos's victories in the courts implied that it had not broken the law, 'it has cer tainly violated shareholders' rights,' Fenkner of Troika said. 'There is a credibility gap. Of all the corporate governance abuses in Russia in 1999 - and there were plenty -Yukos probably provided the best example.' Fenkner acknowledges that the fabulous potential of Yukos's assets may convince Western institutions to give Khodorkovsky the benefit of the doubt. And Khodorkovsky is sure that once the tax burden on Yukos is reduced and its finances improve as a result, he will attract investors to fund expansion. He could not have chosen a better place than London to relaunch himself. The authoritarian gravedigger of human rights in Chechnya, Vladimir Putin, used a visit to Tony Blair in April to make himself appear dignified and statesmanlike.

Having secured \u00a31 million in backing, the company has moved into offices in London's Victoria and is busy recruiting staff to help develop its site. </p> <p><strong> Thursday 8am </strong></p> <p>Flametree founders Jayne Buxton and Rosemary Leith are holding a conference call with their web design agency. Such is the pace of activity at the moment that the pair hold two conference calls a day. </p> <p>Unfortunately Callum, the site's chief designer, is nowhere to be found. Someone suggests emailing him. There is a look of horror on the face of the founders when they hear his address is at 'squat.com'. </p> <p>Despite Callum's no-show, things are moving along nicely. More than 60 per cent of the content has been loaded on to the site, and the BBC wants to make a fly-on-the-wall-documentary about the company (back off, we was here first). </p> <p>Last week the company invited its 'friends of Flametree' to drop in, sip a glass of wine, play with the site and give their verdicts. 'Overall we were just bowled over,' Buxton recalls. 'It was fantastic feedback. The look and feel of the site came out really well. One woman said \"you've really got soul here\".' </p> <p>The plan is to turn the 'friends' into evangelists for the site. They will help spread the Flametree gospel by word of mouth and email. The advertising industry even has a term for this low-cost PR: 'viral marketing'. </p> <p>However, certain areas where the site could be improved did come to light. </p> <p>'We need to draw people into it better - really handhold and direct and choreograph someone's visit,' Buxton says. 'Things that we think are simple on the website are not simple. For example, we want people to email their favourite items to a friend. We know how to do that, but a lot of people don't. You need a foolproof explanation saying \"click on this\". That usability advice can be really helpful.' </p> <p>The pair now believe their decision not to use 'Flash' technology on their website, which takes a long time to download, has been vindicated. 'When you're clicking on the site and your child's having a nap you don't have time to download. Your free time's over by the time you do,' Leith says. </p> <p>The pair are also pleased that they chose to use a server based in the UK, over near Canary Wharf. If they had chosen to rent one in the US it would have been cheaper, but 'there is no substitute for proximity in being able to crisis-manage', Buxton says. </p> <p>Likewise, by renting the largest server available, they believe there should be no future traffic complications caused by constant upgrades. </p> <p>One thing that emerged was the enthusiasm the site's users have for its online user forums. Flametree sees the forums as crucial because they help to build a sense of community - helping users to interact with each other - something that makes the site different from a conventional online magazine. </p> <p>Ideally the company would have its own branded set of forums for the launch, but this does not look possible. Instead, the plan is to go initially for an off-the-shelf package, which will allow for less customisation. </p> <p>Chris, who arrived from Canada last week as the company's content and technical manager, is charged with making the web designers and the editorial teams sing from the same hymn sheet. </p> <p>He is sanguine about having to use this software package rather than the custom-made solution: 'There is no such thing as an ideal world.' He seems ruthlessly committed to making things run on time. 'Anything beyond 48 hours for functionality and we're not necessarily that far ahead,' he bellows into a speakerphone. </p> <p>Having hit the one-month-old milestone, Flametree, now with seven full-time employees, is too big for its office. But Leith is confident that the landlord will agree to their moving into a larger office in the next couple of weeks. </p> <p>For now the staff have to make do like sardines, crushed together between walls papered with 'to do' lists.</p>",

Orange, injected into France T\u00e9l\u00e9com's portfolio of mobile phone assets, expects to have 30 million subscribers across 16 countries by the end of this year. Vodafone, following its acquisition of Germany's Mannesmann (Orange's former owner) has 53 million subscribers in 25 countries worldwide. </p> <p>And there's another potential giant: Deutsche Telekom. In addition to its native T-Mobile - with 11 mil lion subscribers - it also owns Britain's One2One, Max Mobil of Austria and joint ventures in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Russia and the Ukraine. </p> <p>'If you looked at the UK wireless market two years ago there were the same four operators who are here now. But the big difference now is that three of them have been pumped up enormously,' says David Wilkins, principal analyst at research firm Analysys. 'All eyes are now on BT Cellnet which, analysts agree, needs to find some new partners fast if it is not to be left behind.' </p> <p>That's partly because customers are becoming more international, expecting the same services from the same provider wherever they go. </p> <p>The other force driving consolidation is the soaring costs of third-generation mobile phone systems: both the licences and the equipment needed to make them work. These '3G' networks can support wire-free internet services - opening the door to lucrative new revenue streams. </p> <p>We can already see the first signs that data services are becoming important. In March last year, Vodafone subscribers received 15 million text messages using SMS technology - the 'paging' system available on most existing handsets. By March of this year, the figure had jumped to more than 140 million messages - reaching 43 per cent of customers. Data now represents 6 per cent of Vodafone's revenues. Imagine the traffic when new technology will allow us to send each other video clips or business presentations. </p> <p>But such new technology does not come cheap. Britain's recent auction of 3G mobile phone licences might have made Gordon Brown think all his hogmanays had come at once - but it means big headaches for Gent and his competitors. Other countries, including Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland, saw how much the licences were worth to the operators and promptly decided to auction off their own radio spectrum. Some analysts now believe operators will have to pay in excess of \u00a380bn to acquire 3G networks around the world. </p> <p>This has serious implications for smaller players. Analysts at JP Morgan said recently that operators 'with a smaller footprint' - fewer subscribers - may be forced to consider 'alliances, joint ventures or possible consolidation' to match the advantages of scale delivered by companies such as Vodafone. </p> <p>But what about the two giants? The City has been spooked by the high costs of 3G services. Vodafone's share price plunged as investors queried whether the company could afford to fulfil its global ambitions. Selling Orange brought a welcome respite as fears about Vodafone's debt levels subsided. The flotation of Verizon, its joint venture with Bell Atlantic in the US, coupled with the sale of some non-core assets which came with the Mannesmann takeover, will also help swell Vodafone's coffers. </p> <p>Similarly, the new-look Orange - which will float for around \u00a3100bn within the next nine months - must also convince investors that it can afford the hefty prices 3G demands. </p> <p>Some analysts continue to have reservations that the costs of 3G will be too high for operators to recoup their expenditure over the 20-year licences. </p> <p>Signficantly, last week Gent muttered about Vodafone UK producing an IRR (internal rate of return) of at least 15 per cent on its 3G activities in the UK. To put that another way, Vodafone intends to earn 15 per cent more from 3G services than it will have to spend on developing and operating them. </p> <p>This is no mean feat. 'Some of the modelling we've done shows that if a licence costs \u00a32bn the company should be looking for a return of around 18 per cent. Go up to \u00a34bn and you should look for a return of 13 per cent,' said Stephen Pentland, a partner at Spectrum Strategy Consultants.Vodafone paid nearly \u00a36bn for its UK licence. 'The challenge for Vodafone is to justify paying that extra \u00a32bn,' Pentland said. This argument will be reinforced following the impending German auction which, analysts predict, will fetch even higher prices. </p> <p>An IRR of anything less than 15 per cent, analysts say, would send alarm bells ringing among Vodafone's investors who would look to switch into other stocks. Of course, given that no one really has a clue how big the wireless world will be, this figure might turn out to be embarrassingly conservative. But the question is how to exploit the opportunity. </p> <p>Both Orange and Vodafone face problems. Vodafone has been tardy in rolling out wireless data services in comparison with Orange. 'Vodafone is still slow to get off the mark in WAP,' Pentland said. Indeed, just compare the SMS message volumes on the two companies' networks. Vodafone may have had 140 million SMS messages sent over its network in March - but this was dwarfed by Orange's 200 million. Vodafone also suffers from an image problem. </p> <p>'Vodafone has a strong corporate brand but not a strong consumer brand,' Pentland said. </p> <p>It's no surprise, therefore, that Orange will roll its brand out across Europe while Vodafone is left mithering about whether it should try to unite its diverse sweep of brands behind a single name. </p> <p>This might not sound too important but the brand does have an effect on the bottom line. While Vodafone has a churn rate - the number of customers it loses - of nearly 30 per cent in the UK, Orange has half that, thanks largely to the strength of its brand. </p> <p>Analysts at JP Morgan conclude: 'The overall performance of Orange in the first quarter of this year suggests that Vodafone may struggle to retain leadership of incremental market share this year.' </p> <p>Orange, meanwhile, has its own problems. The French government owns a majority stake in France T\u00e9l\u00e9com which raises questions about the company's autonomy. Snook built Orange around his own personal vision of the wireless future.

      "body": "<p><strong> Don't hold your breath waiting for Jeff on the nine o'clock news</strong><br> Despite indications to the contrary, Greg Dyke has not entirely forfeited expensive luxuries at the BBC. Gone, maybe, are the croissants, replaced by Mother's Pride toast (and no jam). Gone too are the company cars and chauffeurs - replaced by a secondhand Sunshine Variety Bus. But Greg is thinking big in terms of his hirings. </p> <p>For instance he has supposedly decided that instead of an economics editor to replace Peter Jay when he retires, what the corporation needs is a business editor. Sensible enough. And he has a name in mind for that august post. It is one Jeff Randall, who we quite like here at media diary - despite his efforts to spoil our fun with his dodgy organ Sunday Business . </p> <p>But as it is a rare vacancy that arises these days without Jeff's monicker being planted firmly in the frame, we suggest that the Beeb may have to go well beyond the \u00a337,500 it routinely pays exalted reporting staff. Particularly as we hear reports that when Jeff's incentive package matures next year at Sunday Biz he has been saying he will 'plonk my fat arse on the hottest beach I can find'. Perhaps, then, he should be in the frame for John Simpson's job, too. </p> <p><strong> Making Michael blush</strong><br> We believe we have found something that makes Michael Jackson, chief executive of 'Channel Swore', blush. Apart, of course, from our entirely unwarranted attack on his masculinity a couple of weeks ago, prompted by a curiously camp photo of him posing on an old fridge. Apparently, C4 has finally drawn the line. Following its programme 'A short history of the F word', the channel turned down a sequel, 'A short history of the C word'. This is apparently on the grounds that while the F word is generally acceptable for late-night broadcast, the C word isn't. Either that or it could be the Channel showing sensitivity after its own unfortunate recent history with the C word. Jacko's predecessor, Michael Grade, was furious when, in a subliminal nano-second, Chris Morris managed to insert the legend 'Grade is a c-' into his Brass Eye programme. </p> <p> <strong> Catch another herring</strong><br> Red Herring , the fabulously with-it e-zine, has been legally pursuing a tiny Scottish distillery - Inver House - for the branding of its newsletter The Red Herring, which is distributed to a mere 3,000 of the distillery's customers. Now the Inver House house journal is having to change its name, but media diary rang the ponytailed fops at Red Herring to ask why they hadn't done anything about the far more plagiaristic website, <a href=\"http://www.redherring.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Red Herring.co.uk</a>. 'What website?' they said. We await our legal finder's fee with interest. </p> <p> <strong> Cause and effect?</strong><br> We are alarmed to report that since Times columnist Joanna Coles announced her official support for Hillary Clinton in last Friday's paper, the First Lady's lead in the polls for the New York Senate seat has plummeted from 14 points to two. Could this be a coincidence?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Don't hold your breath waiting for Jeff on the nine o'clock news Despite indications to the contrary, Greg Dyke has not entirely forfeited expensive luxuries at the BBC. Gone, maybe, are the croissants, replaced by Mother's Pride toast (and no jam). Gone too are the company cars and chauffeurs - replaced by a secondhand Sunshine Variety Bus. But Greg is thinking big in terms of his hirings. For instance he has supposedly decided that instead of an economics editor to replace Peter Jay when he retires, what the corporation needs is a business editor. Sensible enough. And he has a name in mind for that august post. It is one Jeff Randall, who we quite like here at media diary - despite his efforts to spoil our fun with his dodgy organ Sunday Business . But as it is a rare vacancy that arises these days without Jeff's monicker being planted firmly in the frame, we suggest that the Beeb may have to go well beyond the \u00a337,500 it routinely pays exalted reporting staff. Particularly as we hear reports that when Jeff's incentive package matures next year at Sunday Biz he has been saying he will 'plonk my fat arse on the hottest beach I can find'. Perhaps, then, he should be in the frame for John Simpson's job, too. Making Michael blush We believe we have found something that makes Michael Jackson, chief executive of 'Channel Swore', blush. Apart, of course, from our entirely unwarranted attack on his masculinity a couple of weeks ago, prompted by a curiously camp photo of him posing on an old fridge. Apparently, C4 has finally drawn the line. Following its programme 'A short history of the F word', the channel turned down a sequel, 'A short history of the C word'. This is apparently on the grounds that while the F word is generally acceptable for late-night broadcast, the C word isn't. Either that or it could be the Channel showing sensitivity after its own unfortunate recent history with the C word. Jacko's predecessor, Michael Grade, was furious when, in a subliminal nano-second, Chris Morris managed to insert the legend 'Grade is a c-' into his Brass Eye programme. Catch another herring Red Herring , the fabulously with-it e-zine, has been legally pursuing a tiny Scottish distillery - Inver House - for the branding of its newsletter The Red Herring, which is distributed to a mere 3,000 of the distillery's customers. Now the Inver House house journal is having to change its name, but media diary rang the ponytailed fops at Red Herring to ask why they hadn't done anything about the far more plagiaristic website, Red Herring.co.uk. 'What website?' they said. We await our legal finder's fee with interest. Cause and effect? We are alarmed to report that since Times columnist Joanna Coles announced her official support for Hillary Clinton in last Friday's paper, the First Lady's lead in the polls for the New York Senate seat has plummeted from 14 points to two. Could this be a coincidence?",

The money being the estimated \u00a352 billion it will take to deliver a shiny, new railway system over the next decade. </p> <p>Corbett told The Observer last week: 'For the Government there is a key policy choice to be made.

But Corbett pointed out without irony that the project was still 'on track', with just a slight 'funding' issue to be resolved. He is fighting his corner. </p> <p>All the indications are that the Government will announce next month that it is putting extra funding into the industry - probably around \u00a32bn a year, in addition to halting the decline in subsidies to the train operators. Much of this money will end up being spent by the same names in the industry that have attracted so much criticism since privatisation, with Railtrack at the top of the list. </p> <p>But the Government hopes tighter regulation, more competition on certain contracts and Railtrack's protracted comeuppance will 'turn the oil tanker' towards greater efficiency, investment and performance on the network. </p> <p>And much as many people would like Railtrack to be smashed up or renationalised, that is just not going to happen, Government sources have made clear. </p> <p>Corbett insists not only that Railtrack is improving and will eventually win the public's confidence but also, as he first told The Observe r two months ago, he is no longer on the profit and shareholder agenda: his first priority is public service. </p> <p>Morton had proposed taking the future expansion projects away from Railtrack, and even new maintenance contracting and plans to replace worn out infrastructure. </p> <p>The company would be able to bid for such projects, but only in competition with the likes of Balfour Beatty, Taylor Woodrow, Bechtel and Jarvis. The idea was that this would make Railtrack more efficient and prevent calamities along the lines of the West Coast project, which suddenly more than doubled to \u00a35.8bn. </p> <p>One observer said last week: 'This was the equivalent of Alastair putting his tanks on Gerald's lawn; and Railtrack just about called in the Army to get them off.' </p> <p>It could ultimately have been the end of the line for Railtrack if it lost contracts and, over a decade or so, found itself in charge of less and less of the network. Corbett was furious, and a compromise has been reached. </p> <p>Projects to expand the network will, in future, be designed and costed by committee. People from Railtrack, Morton's's Strategic Rail Authority, the train operators and project management rivals such as Bechtel will perform this function together, almost as a form of voluntary audit. Railtrack has lobbied successfully not to be left out of any project and to be allowed to own and manage each new piece of infrastructure once it is complete. Corbett said: 'We are at the heart of the network and we have to run it. The railway is fragmented enough as it is, and such an arrangement [open competition] would have been absolute pandemonium.' </p> <p>As he sees it, only his company can pull everything together: there is only one answer when you look at who manages the existing network, who is in charge of safety, who deals with train operators when they want improvements, who adjusts the timetables to take account of developments and who is in charge of maintenance and renewal work. And that answer is Railtrack. </p> <p>He insists that the company that has been the subject of so much opprobrium is now 'pointing in the right direction'. Indicators such as broken rails, signals passed at danger, track quality, delays to trains and investment are all improving, although he admits there is still a long way to go. By the middle of next year, the quality of the network will be back up to the standard of 1994, but carrying 20 per cent more trains. </p> <p>Corbett acknowledges that this is a Pyrrhic victory: 'Our enemies will say that is pathetic. But you never get praise in the public sector.' The message is, you are all stuck with Railtrack but we are getting better, honestly. </p> <p>The company has finally accepted that it is locked in a dance with Morton, Winsor and the Government. But this is more about getting the public sector to pay up than a new culture of obedience at Railtrack. As for the ultimate corporate sacrifice, Corbett said: 'Resignation? What a lot of nonsense.' </p> <p>It looks as though his detractors will have to hurl him through the windows of that thirteenth-floor office if they are to get rid of him.</p>",

He points out that laws in general - and the US Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 in particular - contributed to highly adversarial relations. </p> <p>He states: 'The LMRA is designed to permit economic warfare between employers and unions in controlled set tings and on relatively equal grounds.' But he points out that despite the Act, unions are in decline in the US - from 37 per cent of private sector workers in 1960, to 9.4 per cent in 1999. </p> <p>In the UK, he says 'some employers will undoubtedly be targets. If those employers are not getting this kind of training, they are not going to be prepared.' </p> <p>In fact, big British unions have been playing down the confrontational potential in the Act. For example, the GMB manufacturing union says: 'The ideal would be that we don't reach that stage.' </p> <p>And the AEEU emphasises partnership deals limiting industrial action in return for collaboration on pay, conditions and training. </p> <p>But, as Lips explains, his experience in dealing with labour disputes in America tells him companies should be wary. 'I would expect unions to exercise the economic power that the legislation has given them, and that is nothing but an adversarial activity.' And he adds: 'That can lead to a strike. And if you have a strike it is about as serious an economic event as can happen to a company.' </p> <p>Lips warns that the UK legislation 'more favourably supports unions' organisational efforts than the labour law in the US'. He indicates that American union resistance techniques - which he links to the fact that union certification elections fell by 8.5 per cent in 1999 - could be employed in the UK. </p> <p>The key is to gain the initiative before a union decides to initiate a ballot for recognition, triggering the legal process. After a ballot is called, an employer has to open premises to unions for campaigning, which can mean notice boards, and email and PA systems. </p> <p>If a ballot is called, the campaign should be stepped up with the following messages: 'strikes are futile and fatal' and 'unions cost more than they are worth'. In the US, badges and baseball caps are used by management and unions in ballot campaigns. </p> <p>Another crucial area is defining the 'bargaining unit' - a factory, group of workers or division of a company - which is balloting for recognition. Lips' advice to employers is to lobby hard the Central Arbitration committee, which rules on the definition of the bargaining unit. He says: 'Attempt to gerrymander the unit to include the most favourable votes. The union will.' </p> <p>Eversheds is pushing US methods in the UK. Partner Martin Warren says that the firm will work with companies that want partnerships as well as those that want to keep unions out. For the lat ter, he suggests techniques such as pointing to the union general secretary's salary, and painting it as a high-cost organisation selling a service for a profit like a company. </p> <p>The roadshows appear to have been successful. Lips has found that members of the UK subsidiaries of American companies attending the seminars - those invited included McDonald's, Dow Chemical, and Bristol Myers Squibb - have contacted him saying they want their US superiors to wake up to what is happening in the UK. </p> <p>Owen Warnock, another partner with Eversheds, says that the firm has advised both UK companies and UK subsidiaries. It can also put clients in contact with US consultants, such as PTI Labor Research, for advice. </p> <p>PTI partner Mildred Blowen says Eversheds has provided a useful entrance to the UK. 'One of the issues that is going to be big in the UK as it is in the US is what contribution trades unions make to lower productivity.' </p> <p>Another partner, Stuart Keene, claims PTI has more than 1,000 clients in the US, many of them blue chip, and many are asking about their UK subsidiaries. He also says: 'We are working with several FTSE 100 companies to advise them on techniques.' </p> <p>PTI will devise a video campaign reinforcing new messages each week, using video and compulsory 'captive meetings' of employees. Message include: union finances; how unions spend their money; how unions can make companies fail; the impact on personal finances of striking; and how good the company is. </p> <p>Union reaction is predictable. 'We have heard that there are companies from the US trying to offer these services. They should bugger off back to the US,' said one union spokesman. But the TUC also points to figures showing membership up 0.6 per cent last year without the Act, and the number of recognition deals increasing. </p> <p>The AEEU says partnership does work in the UK but it is clear that unions do have targets. There are old adversaries and scores to settle. The National Union of Journalists - which faced widespread derecognition in the Eighties - has a number of such struggles it believes the Act will help it win. </p> <p>HIGH profile targets include News International, the Independent and Associated Newspapers, owner of the Daily Mail . General Secretary John Foster believes the Act will be a great help. But recognition struggles will be difficult - the unions still have to recruit 10 per cent of employees and demonstrate that at least a further 40 per cent will vote for recognition. </p> <p>'It will be tough to get back, particularly in places like News International. But we're confident,' Foster says. But he is upbeat about recent voluntary recognition deals including with regional newspaper group Newsquest. </p> <p>Jimmy Elsby, assistant general secretary of the Transport and General Workers, says that despite increased recognition deals in advance of the Act, there are T&amp;G targets. 'American companies appear to be worse,' he says. </p> <p>He points to a Motorola plant in East Kilbride, where union membership among the 2,000 workers jumped from a few to 400 within weeks following a dispute over part-time shift patterns. Motorola has refused to negotiate over recognition, says Elsby. 'We look forward to using the Act.' The T&amp;G is also organising drivers for a ballot at the Robert Wiseman dairy group. </p> <p>This law will help white- collar unions too. Unifi, the financial services union, has a longstanding dispute with HSBC about recognition for managers. The Act will help here. But it will do more than help unions get back into manufacturing and traditional service sectors. Unifi, like other service unions, is trying to recruit in growth areas of the new economy. </p> <p>Call centres now employ 250,000, some 45 per cent of them in financial services. 'They are clearly a target for us. They are greenfield sites with no history of unions,' says Unifi's Dai Davies. </p> <p>He points to Barclaycall, the phone banking side of Barclays, where a voluntary ballot found 87 per cent of those voting in favour of union recognition. </p> <p>Companies and unions which can't get on will clearly use the Act ruthlessly, but one of the main problems the unions will face is squabbling among themselves. </p> <p>Some are criticised for drumming up membership in companies where others have traditionally operated. Sometimes they are accused of signing 'sweetheart' deals with employers to increase membership. And employers will try to introduce tame staff associations to undermine demands for unions. </p> <p>This has not passed the lawyers by. Martin Warren says: 'Whether the UK union movement can work together to exploit the opportunities undoubtedly offered to it by the Act remains to be seen.' </p> <p>A clear warning from the lawyers that if the unions can be divided, they can be ruled, whatever the law says. </p> <p><strong>How ballots for recognition will work</strong></p> <p>Unions can ballot for recognition in all companies with more than 21 employees. Smaller companies are exempt. Recognition allows unions to represent employees in various areas, for example collective bargaining for pay and conditions, and representation in grievance procedures. </p> <p>The process is triggered when a union applies for a ballot. Usually it will have been canvassing for members, so it can meet the requirements to show a 10 per cent membership within the bargaining unit - the group of workers to be covered by the recognition agreement - and that a further 50 per cent are likely to support recognition. </p> <p>The employer has 10 days to respond. It can agree recognition straight away. If it does not there are 20 days for negotiation. If it still refuses, the Central Arbitration Committee is called in. First it will rule on the bargaining unit (BU). Employers could have an advantage here - the rules say that the bargaining unit must be compatible with 'effective management'. </p> <p>There is a 20-day period for the employer and union to agree the BU. If at the end of that period there is no agreement, the committee will make a decision after another 10 days. </p> <p>If the union can prove a majority of membership in that bargaining unit, then it gains recognition. If not, there is a ballot - either postal or at the workplace - within 20 days. Costs are shared. </p> <p>If the union wins, there is automatic recognition. If it loses, it cannot re-apply for recognition within three years. The union must not only win 50 per cent in the ballot, but must have at least 40 per cent of the BU voting. </p> <p>One final point is that the union must be able to prove that it is genuinely independent - it cannot be a stooge of the employer. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailro:oliver.morgan@observer.co.uk\">oliver.morgan@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Free houses - pubs owned outright by the licensee - are rare, and the number of tied pubs - owned by a brewery which restricts the sale of outside beers - is diminishing. </p> <p>Managed pubs, owned by the chains, where as the name implies the manager is paid a salary, may have their own problems with wages and conditions but the latest threat is to tenanted pubs, those where the licensee pays rent and buys beer from the operator, keeping whatever profit is left. </p> <p>Each month, according to the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), 20 pubs close down. They are forced out by rent rises, low margins on beer sales, and by having to give half of their revenue from food and gaming machines to their landlords, the pub operating companies. </p> <p>In rural areas, the picture is particularly bleak, thanks to dramatic downturns in British farming. </p> <p>The plight of the landlord has worsened over the past 10 years - since the Beer Orders of 1989, under which the Government capped the amount of pubs any brewer could own and required breweries to allow landlords to sell a 'guest beer'. The idea was to introduce new competition. </p> <p>While new entrants have indeed emerged, this tactic appears to have failed. There are 60,000 pubs in Britain, and over 10,000 of them are now owned by pub operating companies backed by City money. </p> <p>These players are not bound by the 1989 Beer Orders and are eager to acquire more pubs. Two weeks ago Enterprise Inns - the largest quoted pub operator - snapped up 183 pubs from Whitbread for \u00a3119 million. It now owns more than 2,500 establishments. Enter prise and companies such as Japanese investment bank Nomura and Hugh Osmond's Punch Taverns ,which are the leading pub companies, now act as quasi-property firms, securitising the rent and beer sale incomes they receive from landlords. </p> <p>In addition, pub operating companies can negotiate with breweries for significant discounts on barrels of beer, beer that they sell on to landlords at huge margins. In effect, an expensive middleman has been created. Most make additional revenue out of the landlords when they leave their premises, hitting them for huge dilapidation claims. </p> <p>The situation has got so serious that earlier this year the Competition Commission reopened the Beer Orders inquiry. It is due to report this August, and those close to the inquiry indicate that it may force pub operating companies to reduce the price at which they sell beer to pubs. </p> <p>For struggling landlords, this cannot come a moment too soon. According to the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association, 1.3 million pints of beer are illegally imported each day. Minimum wages, increased business rates and EU directives on working conditions have also increased pub running costs. </p> <p>If that were not enough, UK beer consumption is falling. The amount downed has fallen from 39.9 million barrels in 1989 to less than 36 million last year. </p> <p>Britain's biggest brewers have now largely shunned pubs, preferring to focus on themed bars such as All Bar One and the Pitcher &amp; Piano chain, where customers tend to drink higher-margin bottled beer and spirits. </p> <p>The tactic has enticed more women into bars, but sceptics fear these establishments will have a limited life. 'They will be rebranded or sold off once their novelty fades,' said Iain Loe of Camra. 'Landlords are under more pressure than ever. Upward-only rent contracts and red tape are forcing many out.' </p> <p>The Federation of Licensed Victuallers' Associations says that to survive, landlords need to develop legal and marketing skills. Indeed there are now vocational diplomas in running pubs. </p> <p>Enterprise Inns chief executive Ted Tuppen, an accountant who, until forming his company in 1991, never ran a pub or brewing firm, said: 'The licensee is the person who makes the premises successful.' But for many surviving on wages of less than \u00a312,000 a year, Tuppen's words are small beer. </p> <p><strong>'A 16-hour day for \u00a310,000. But we can't go - it's our home'</strong><br> As a pub landlord, Peter Lyons claims to have lost more than \u00a350,000 - his entire redundancy pay from the power industry job he lost six years ago. </p> <p>Lyons, aged 51, from Staffordshire, took on a pub with a history of failure but thought he could make it successful as it was in a prime location in a prosperous small town. After paying \u00a3600 to the owner, Enterprise Inns, for a weekend course, he began to suspect that the firm was after only one thing: his money. Initially, his rent was 'reasonable' since the previous tenant made a hash of the operation. But as trade picked up the rent doubled, and he found he had to buy beer exclusively from Enterprise. 'I could have bought it \u00a390 a barrel cheaper,' he said. </p> <p>Lyons, who spent thousands on internal repairs without any contribution from Enterprise, was losing money, so he decided to move to a country pub run by a different operator. But within months, Enterprise took it over as part of a \u00a350 million deal. A similar scenario unfolded. Lyons now works in a hospital. His savings have gone. </p> <p>Tony ister, 45, runs a thriving Newcastle pub which has been in his family for 34 years. Since the 1989 Beer Orders, it has changed hands four times. Lister's rent hasn't changed, but beer from his pub operator costs the same nationwide. 'My punters haven't the same income as those in the South East,' he said. 'My margin on beer is minimal.' </p> <p>Lister pays \u00a326,000 in rent and makes \u00a310,000 each year. </p> <p>He wants to buy the pub, so that he can buy beer more cheaply, but the owner won't sell. 'I work 16 hours a day. I don't think we can get out. This pub is my family's home and we haven't enough cash to start again.' </p> <p>\u0095 Both interviewees requested that their names be changed.</p>",

In addition, pub operating companies can negotiate with breweries for significant discounts on barrels of beer, beer that they sell on to landlords at huge margins. In effect, an expensive middleman has been created. Most make additional revenue out of the landlords when they leave their premises, hitting them for huge dilapidation claims. The situation has got so serious that earlier this year the Competition Commission reopened the Beer Orders inquiry. It is due to report this August, and those close to the inquiry indicate that it may force pub operating companies to reduce the price at which they sell beer to pubs. For struggling landlords, this cannot come a moment too soon. According to the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association, 1.3 million pints of beer are illegally imported each day. Minimum wages, increased business rates and EU directives on working conditions have also increased pub running costs. If that were not enough, UK beer consumption is falling. The amount downed has fallen from 39.9 million barrels in 1989 to less than 36 million last year. Britain's biggest brewers have now largely shunned pubs, preferring to focus on themed bars such as All Bar One and the Pitcher &amp; Piano chain, where customers tend to drink higher-margin bottled beer and spirits. The tactic has enticed more women into bars, but sceptics fear these establishments will have a limited life. 'They will be rebranded or sold off once their novelty fades,' said Iain Loe of Camra. 'Landlords are under more pressure than ever. Upward-only rent contracts and red tape are forcing many out.' The Federation of Licensed Victuallers' Associations says that to survive, landlords need to develop legal and marketing skills. Indeed there are now vocational diplomas in running pubs. Enterprise Inns chief executive Ted Tuppen, an accountant who, until forming his company in 1991, never ran a pub or brewing firm, said: 'The licensee is the person who makes the premises successful.' But for many surviving on wages of less than \u00a312,000 a year, Tuppen's words are small beer. 'A 16-hour day for \u00a310,000. But we can't go - it's our home' As a pub landlord, Peter Lyons claims to have lost more than \u00a350,000 - his entire redundancy pay from the power industry job he lost six years ago. Lyons, aged 51, from Staffordshire, took on a pub with a history of failure but thought he could make it successful as it was in a prime location in a prosperous small town. After paying \u00a3600 to the owner, Enterprise Inns, for a weekend course, he began to suspect that the firm was after only one thing: his money. Initially, his rent was 'reasonable' since the previous tenant made a hash of the operation. But as trade picked up the rent doubled, and he found he had to buy beer exclusively from Enterprise. 'I could have bought it \u00a390 a barrel cheaper,' he said. Lyons, who spent thousands on internal repairs without any contribution from Enterprise, was losing money, so he decided to move to a country pub run by a different operator. But within months, Enterprise took it over as part of a \u00a350 million deal. A similar scenario unfolded. Lyons now works in a hospital. His savings have gone. Tony ister, 45, runs a thriving Newcastle pub which has been in his family for 34 years. Since the 1989 Beer Orders, it has changed hands four times. Lister's rent hasn't changed, but beer from his pub operator costs the same nationwide. 'My punters haven't the same income as those in the South East,' he said. 'My margin on beer is minimal.' Lister pays \u00a326,000 in rent and makes \u00a310,000 each year. He wants to buy the pub, so that he can buy beer more cheaply, but the owner won't sell. 'I work 16 hours a day. I don't think we can get out. This pub is my family's home and we haven't enough cash to start again.' \u0095 Both interviewees requested that their names be changed.",

That's the central premise of Val McDermid's taut new thriller <strong> Killing The Shadows</strong>, in which academic psychologist and geographical profiler Professor Fiona Cameron hunts down a serial killer working his way through a death list of mystery writers. The killer is targeting those crime writers who have turned psychological profilers into heroes. What makes him especially dangerous is the fact that his methods shatter all conventional views on the way serial killers operate. Cameron's search is given added urgency because her lover, Kit Martin, is a crime writer - and his name is on the list. </p> <p>The geographical profiler carries her own baggage. Weighed down with guilt because her sister was the victim of killer who has never been caught, she is also, at the start of the novel, at odds with the Metropolitan police. She used to work with them until they ignored her recommendations and went ahead with a scheme to catch a killer that turned into an entrapment scandal. </p> <p>Since The Mermaids Singing, McDermid's work has just got better and better, the pinnacle being last year's A Place of Execution - a tremendous piece of fiction, complex and haunting. Killing The Shadows, good as it is, isn't in that class. McDermid's books are always frighteningly convincing, but Killing The Shadows doesn't quite convince in the same way, I think because there is something too 'fictional' about the central conceit of somebody targeting crime writers.</p> <p>And setting, as she does, her fictional mystery writers in the real world of UK crime writing, with its Crime Writers' Association and its Dagger Awards, paradoxically makes the novel less realistic. Even so, taken on its own terms, Killing The Shadows is an absorbing read, an entertaining showcase for McDermid's abundant talents. McDermid not quite at her peak is still head and shoulders above pretty much all of the competition. </p> <p>It's easy to lose all decorum when talking about Bill James's Harpur and Iles police procedural series. British mystery writing's finest prose stylist writes with such verve and originality he transcends what can often be a stale mystery sub-genre to produce novels that are startling, achingly funny and sometimes wholly surreal. <strong> Kill Me</strong> is the seventeenth in the series and the immediate sequel to Eton Crop in which undercover cop Naomi Anstruther's operation among the local drug gangs ended in a bloodbath on the dockside floating restaurant, the Eton Boating Song. In fact, the last few novels in the series have been pretty much contiguous, continuing episodes in a three-way struggle among the police, the local drug barons and London gangsters trying to take over the lucrative drug trade in the unnamed West Country city.</p> <p>In Kill Me the struggle continues. Although violence and fear are described convincingly and the plotting is precise, it is James's gift for characterisation and for describing - largely through dialogue - the interplay of the characters that make Kill Me and the rest of the series so enjoyable. Even the names of the characters are entertaining: Panicking Ralph, Lincoln W. Lincoln (aka Lovely Mover), Corporeal (the skinny Digby Lighthorn) for example. And he can nail a character with a detail: local villains Mansel Shale and Alfie Ivis are somehow more sinister because their tipple is gin and pep out of Brer Rabbit mugs.</p> <p>Dominating all, however, is the relationship between DCS Colin Harpur and ACC Desmond Iles. Harpur and Iles are trapped in a hellish relationship of need and hatred. Each needs the other's skills to work effectively against the crooks. But Iles hates Harpur for having had an affair with his wife; Harpur is trying to keep Iles away from his underage daughter. And Harpur tries to shore up his Chief Constable, who is recovering from a breakdown, against Iles's constant undermining and baiting. </p> <p>Iles is a character of Shakespearean dimensions: seemingly omnipotent, narcissistic, sly, vicious, lustful, quite possibly insane. James has a great gift for dialogue, especially three-way conversations in which each person follows their own train of thought rather than responding to what the others are saying. Although there is tension and there are powerful scenes of violence, Kill Me, as with the others in the series, is a comic novel of a high order in which the reader is constantly put off-balance not with plotting but with aspects of character and the sheer pleasure of the prose.

The book describes itself as Malcolm Bradbury's sixth novel, although it could just as well be his ninth (if you include two novels for television and a novella) or not a novel at all. </p> <p>The more you read it, the less novelish it seems to be. There is a preface in which the author puzzles over exactly what he has written: 'Shall we call it a story?' he asks. Well, if there is a story, it goes something like this: Denis Diderot, fantastical creature (head of philosopher, body of a playwright, short and curlies of a librarian) sells his collection of books - the raw material of his Encyclopaedia - to Catherine the Great, who promptly buys the man himself as an appendix to his own library, and carts off both to her Winter Palace. Two centuries later, a Bradbury-like author/narrator takes part in the Diderot Project. Part homage, part junket trip, the project brings together a group of wryly observed academics and sends them off to St Petersburg in the master's footsteps. </p> <p>There isn't much more story than that, which is to say there isn't a great deal of story. To the Hermitage is a work of fiction in that much of it is imaginary, and for want of a better word you could call it a novel, but it doesn't really feel like one. Much of it reads like first-person travelogue. Large parts are immaculately researched historical fiction. There is a whole biography of Diderot written and then fictionalised, as well as vestigial sections of dramatic dialogue. </p> <p>This is a delightful book. Bradbury clearly enjoyed its creation. He is a fine satirist, particularly of the academic world. At its best, his writing is very English, very funny, with a sweetly veiled cynicism. There is a disgust with liberal values, a frustration with foreign customs, but it is all hedged in an affectionate language more reminiscent of Michael Palin than Kingsley Amis. </p> <p>There are dangers in writing at the borders of fact and fiction. It isn't only that the best novels are more truthful than any newspapery facts; Bradbury knows where he stands on this, and makes clear in his preface that he has fictionalised history wherever he feels it can be improved upon. But facts also take up a lot of room. Too much information can pull at a novel, stretch and thicken it. A good biographer should know everything and tell it; a good novelist should know everything and tell only the story it contains. </p> <p>For all its wit and skill, To the Hermitage is a sprawling work, and you know it's going to sprawl several pages before you reach the opening line, somewhere between the author's preface and the two pages of epigrams. One of the trends in contemporary British fiction is for novels to be lean and perfectly formed, like catwalk models; every word should do the work of 10, as they do in poetry. </p> <p>In this sense, To the Hermitage is deeply unfashionable. It is a heavy book, full of diversions and distractions. It moves at a magisterial pace (the ferry from Sweden to Russia leaves on page 90 and doesn't arrive until page 259). It becomes distracted by Descartes or the fall of the Soviet Union. </p> <p>None of this is unpleasant, just very slow. 'Rambling' may not be much of a compliment, but this is high-quality rambling all the same. To the Hermitage is not the story by the direct route, but with endless diversions.

Much of today's industrial-military complex, together with the entire concept of research and development in academic institutes, derives from Haber's rare combination of abstract insight, experimental virtuosity and managerial adroitness.

Well, actually not, and it doesn't take long before the reader, submitting to a rare and confident spell cast by this marvellous novelist, starts to wonder why he ever thought it was a strange idea. Horses have a peculiar magic, of course; everyone knows the power they can wield over pre-adolescent girls, and has glimpsed a fragment of that almost erotic fascination in dozens of children's classics, from Black Beauty onwards. </p> <p>In more literary works, horses have a unique series of meanings; they are prominent in the ancients, and have continued to have some kind of significance bound up with wisdom and nobility. Swift, of course, ends Gulliver's Travels in the land of the Houyhnhns, a sort of Surrey ruled by patient, virtuous horses - rather like a Stubbs painting of mares and foals brought to life. Plenty of people have been impatient with the final book of Gulliver's Travels; Randall Jarrell's character, Gertrude Johnson, 'felt a faint impulse to sweep the last piece off the board, to write an article exposing the Houyhnhns'. </p> <p>But horses have gone on being a powerful symbol - more than that, a statement - of worldly wisdom and right living, and one of the many virtues of this engrossing book is how it restrains an innate temptation towards whimsy and anthropormorphism. Rather, it explores a whole world of human motivation and ambition within the context of horse dealing and racing. Horses, for most of the book, are the blank screen on which the human characters can project their own desires and wishes. </p> <p>Only occasionally does Smiley go into the mind of a horse, with thrilling effect; it could be whimsical, but is always utterly truthful; it would be almost a blasphemy to mention The Horse Whisperer in the same context. There is, it is true, a psychic who reads the minds of horses, but so firm is Smiley's grip that it is not long before the reader is stilled and even moved by the vision of the animal's thoughts.

When a character hocks her house - which has been appreciating steadily in value by 12 per cent per annum - for a horse which may at any second break a leg and become worthless, we know we are in the hands not just of a playful novelist who loves that little interchange of the letter - horse/ house - but a profoundly serious one who is concerned that we should know the facts of her world. Horse Heaven, in short, is written on the purest Marxist principles, and its author wants us to know the economic basis which underlies the slowly gathering action. </p> <p>But if Smiley responds in an intellectual way to the business side of the horse world, the book's greatest virtue is in an unforgettably sensuous responsiveness. The physical presence of horses is conveyed with wonderful variety; Smiley has spent long months sitting in fields, watching them move, and her book loves to set down their movements, to write even the magical incantation of abstruse terminology. 'She had a whole new list of words that she sang voicelessly to herself: furlong, off the pace, sire, dam, yearling, gaskin, withers, hock, router, cannon bone, garden spot, long shot, favourite, girth, blinkers, fetlock, and, of course, filly.' Smiley also loves the thing, the movement, for which there are no words, to which her prose responds as quickly and definitely as iron filings to a magnet. </p> <p>The equine world is the vehicle for perhaps as many as 15 small stories, involving different characters, which are brought together with grand architectural sureness. Horse Heaven covers the whole range of American society, from people with so much money they lie awake at night worrying about how to spend it, to cashiers at Wal-Mart. It satisfies almost every narrative hunger of the reader, from the furious confrontation and the race that ends in tragedy, to the fairy-tale flourish of a prince in a glittering carriage finding his beautiful princess working in a convenience store, before leading her out into a new world. </p> <p>Smiley writes as relaxed people speak, and her characters speak as real people speak, two virtues which ought to be more common than they are in the contemporary American novel. She knows, as Dickens did, just when to be vulgar, and, more importantly, when not to be. Massive, thrillingly articulated, unfailingly intelligent and warmly humorous, Smiley's last two or three novels have been what Tom Wolfe's are popularly supposed to be (Horse Heaven is even better than Moo). She is the most perfect vindication of the realist novel, of the speaking voice. In her sensuous responsiveness to the facts of the world, her cool, amused, analytical gaze, she has started to look like the best living American novelist.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Horse Heaven Jane Smiley Faber \u00a317.99, pp576 A novel about horses, more than 200,000 words long? Is Jane Smiley joking? Well, actually not, and it doesn't take long before the reader, submitting to a rare and confident spell cast by this marvellous novelist, starts to wonder why he ever thought it was a strange idea. Horses have a peculiar magic, of course; everyone knows the power they can wield over pre-adolescent girls, and has glimpsed a fragment of that almost erotic fascination in dozens of children's classics, from Black Beauty onwards. In more literary works, horses have a unique series of meanings; they are prominent in the ancients, and have continued to have some kind of significance bound up with wisdom and nobility. Swift, of course, ends Gulliver's Travels in the land of the Houyhnhns, a sort of Surrey ruled by patient, virtuous horses - rather like a Stubbs painting of mares and foals brought to life. Plenty of people have been impatient with the final book of Gulliver's Travels; Randall Jarrell's character, Gertrude Johnson, 'felt a faint impulse to sweep the last piece off the board, to write an article exposing the Houyhnhns'. But horses have gone on being a powerful symbol - more than that, a statement - of worldly wisdom and right living, and one of the many virtues of this engrossing book is how it restrains an innate temptation towards whimsy and anthropormorphism. Rather, it explores a whole world of human motivation and ambition within the context of horse dealing and racing. Horses, for most of the book, are the blank screen on which the human characters can project their own desires and wishes. Only occasionally does Smiley go into the mind of a horse, with thrilling effect; it could be whimsical, but is always utterly truthful; it would be almost a blasphemy to mention The Horse Whisperer in the same context. There is, it is true, a psychic who reads the minds of horses, but so firm is Smiley's grip that it is not long before the reader is stilled and even moved by the vision of the animal's thoughts. But horses are seen as much as carriers of human values, freighted with considerations which mean nothing to them; many are as much economic facts as physical ones. The costs of acquiring a horse are clearly set out, along with the assets of the buyer and how the money has been raised; prize money in racing is contemplated without embarrassment, as is the depreciation in value which a living horse inevitably incurs.

Murray reminds us what a monster the Marquess was. He was a vicious man who damned his family to misery. None more so than Alfred, although his other son, Percy, was described by his father as a 'sicked-up looking creature, as if he had come up the wrong way. When he was a child swathed in irons to hold him together it used to make me sick to look at him and think that he could be called my son.' </p> <p>Murray's account of the familiar tragedy of Wilde's trials is well marshalled. He points out that when Bosie failed to make it into the dock to defend Wilde, the rest of his life would seem to have been a series of attempts - often in the courts - to make up for the fact. Most crucial of all is the time-bomb of Wilde's prison letter to Douglas, De Profundis, which was kept from Bosie by Wilde's 'devoted friend' Robbie Ross and which Murray correctly sees as Wilde's most 'destructive legacy' to Douglas. </p> <p>Bosie became twisted up in his own past, his literary talent wastefully channelled into vituperative sonnets and magazines which seem to exist solely for the purposes of pursuing his campaigns against Robbie Ross, the Asquiths, Jews, and any other party by whom he felt wronged. This sometimes tiresome sequence of spats culminated in the infamous Pemberton Billing trial of 1918, when the protofascist MP Billing alleged the war effort was being undermined by sexual perverts in the highest positions of influence. Douglas, seizing the opportunity for revenge on Ross - and Wilde, by one remove - and encouraged by Billing in his mad conspiracy theories, took the stand to declare that Wilde was 'the greatest force of evil that has appeared in Europe during the last 350 years'. </p> <p>But Douglas's public nadir came when Churchill sued him over wild allegations that he had taken part in a Jewish-financed conspiracy to have Kitchener 'murdered' in 1916; Douglas received a prison sentence. Murray depicts this as a turning-point in Douglas's life. Like Wilde, Douglas wrote an epic work whilst in prison - In Excelsis - which his biographer sees as a purging of his old obsessions, although with lines such as 'The leprous spawn of scattered Israel/Spends its contagion in your English blood', it merely repeated the kind of libels which had got Douglas into prison in the first place. Contorted in the fundamentalist pathology of the time, such accusations were little removed from those made by Billing's intellectual patron, Arnold White, that: 'Wilde, after death, was found to have a tumour on his brain, a fact that pointed to a hospital rather than Reading gaol'. </p> <p>Yet Douglas did redeem himself in the Twenties and Thirties, repledging his name to Wilde's. Abandoned by his wife, his son in a mental hospital, slipping further into poverty, he was supported only by his undoubted Catholic faith and friends as disparate as Marie Stopes and Bernard Shaw. In a centennial year which threatens many more books on Wilde, Murray's book does a fine job of putting an irksome and faded legendary boy to bed. </p> <p> \u0095 Philip Hoare's study of the Billing case, Wilde's Last Stand , is published by Duckworth</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> In America</strong><br>Susan Sontag<br>Jonathan Cape \u00a316.99, pp387</p> <p> Susan Sontag, it seems, never wanted to be the most intelligent woman in America. All the austere essay writing, the elegant forays into postmodernism, the effortless deconstruction of contemporary metaphors were apparently a distraction from her real ambition: to write breast-heaving historical romances.</p> <p>Talking of In America in recent interviews, she has noted how, in the past, she allowed her 'insufferable moralism to kidnap her' and of how in her youth 'she couldn't resist the attention' afforded to her by her reputation for uncompromising intellectualism. Now, she says, she feels the freedom to pursue her real passions; and her real passions, on the evidence of this book, are for Victorian melodrama.</p> <p>In The Volcano Lover, Sontag's last novel, a fictionalised account of Lord Nelson's affair with Emma Hamilton, she carried off her unironic tale of grand passions by giving it the apparatus of a smart inquiry into the nature of historical fiction: it set itself up as a page-turner which occasionally obliged its readers to examine the nature of page turning. She attempts something similar here, but her framing is more laboured and her story less affecting.</p> <p>In America tells the true-ish adventures of a celebrated Polish stage actress of the 1870s, Maryna Zalezowska, who travels to the west of America with a retinue of friends and admirers, in search of emancipation, even Utopia.

      "bodyText": "In America Susan Sontag Jonathan Cape \u00a316.99, pp387 Susan Sontag, it seems, never wanted to be the most intelligent woman in America. All the austere essay writing, the elegant forays into postmodernism, the effortless deconstruction of contemporary metaphors were apparently a distraction from her real ambition: to write breast-heaving historical romances. Talking of In America in recent interviews, she has noted how, in the past, she allowed her 'insufferable moralism to kidnap her' and of how in her youth 'she couldn't resist the attention' afforded to her by her reputation for uncompromising intellectualism. Now, she says, she feels the freedom to pursue her real passions; and her real passions, on the evidence of this book, are for Victorian melodrama. In The Volcano Lover, Sontag's last novel, a fictionalised account of Lord Nelson's affair with Emma Hamilton, she carried off her unironic tale of grand passions by giving it the apparatus of a smart inquiry into the nature of historical fiction: it set itself up as a page-turner which occasionally obliged its readers to examine the nature of page turning. She attempts something similar here, but her framing is more laboured and her story less affecting. In America tells the true-ish adventures of a celebrated Polish stage actress of the 1870s, Maryna Zalezowska, who travels to the west of America with a retinue of friends and admirers, in search of emancipation, even Utopia. It has been published amid a minor storm in the States over Sontag's borrowings from the real-life career and memoirs of one Helena Modjeska.

      "body": "<p><strong> Between Camps: Race, Identity and Nationalism at the End of the Colour Line</strong><br>Paul Gilroy<br>Allen Lane \u00a322.50, pp416<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501024332,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Earlier this month, Jack Straw took part in a Sunday Times-sponsored debate in London on 'The Growing Threat of the Underclass'. The keynote speaker was the American social scientist Charles Murray, whose best known work, The Bell Curve (1994), manipulated recent genetics research to explain why so many African-Americans were on welfare. Ignoring such petty factors as poor schooling or lack of federal investment, he claimed that the problem lay with the IQ scores of black people which were lower than those of other ethnic groups. Their genes made them stupid. Why are they poor? Literally, it is 'cause they is black. </p> <p>Pathologising black people on spurious evidence is nothing new. Imperialism could not have flourished without it. Kant, in his 'Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and the Sublime', approvingly quoted Hume's assertion that blacks were incapable of producing 'anything great in art or science or any other praiseworthy quality'. Fifty years earlier, Carolus Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist who first classified the natural world, had divided mankind into five categories which casually blurred moral and physical attributes: Europeans were 'gentle, acute, inventive' while Asiatics were 'severe, haughty, covetous' and Africans 'crafty, indolent, negligent'. </p> <p>One of the goals of Between Camps is to look at the crafty and negligent ways in which various European writers have used - and also ignored - the category of 'race' in shaping their ideas about what it is to be modern or even human. Its author, Paul Gilroy, has been one of the consistently interesting thinkers in English academia over the past two decades. Sidestepping the post-structuralist quicksands into which so many of his contemporaries have sunk, he blends sociology, moral philosophy and cultural theory into a heady brew. </p> <p>His work is distinguished not only by its breadth of reference (L\u00e9vinas freestyles with Li'l Kim, while Montaigne gets jiggy wit' Missy Elliott) or by its canny use of puns (Gilroy promotes notions of identity which stress routes rather than roots; it ain't where you're from, it's where you're at), but also by its Utopian vocabulary that invokes the 'yearning' of the disenfranchised peoples it discusses. </p> <p>One of the startling claims Gilroy makes in his new book is that 'race' is on the verge of extinction. Scientists - though not those celebrated by Charles Murray - have not only shown that many disparate ethnic groups hail from the same genetic pool, but that individual tribes in Africa and elsewhere are far more genetically heterogeneous than previously suspected. Strangers among our 'own', newly-affianced to alien peoples - how much longer, asks Gilroy, can we deploy race as a conceptual category?</p> <p>He also questions whether racial theories that have traditionally been founded on negrophobia make much sense now that blackness can 'signify vital prestige rather than abjection in a global info-tainment telesector'. Translated into English, this means that those videos of Puff Daddy flexing and showing out, which MTV spews forth, may help white people think of blacks in a new and positive light. </p> <p>Or perhaps they won't. The Arsenal fans I recently saw on the Tube, interrupted their chorus of 'Spurs are on their way to Auschwitz' to kick a young African student into a bloody pulp. They didn't think their adoration of a black striker such as Nwankwo Kanu obliged them to treat non-football-playing Nigerians with any greater tolerance. Gilroy himself seems to realise this: analysis soon gives way to imprecation as he calls for liberation from 'all racialising and raciological thought, from raciological seeing, racialised thinking, and racialised thinking about thinking'. </p> <p>A particularly fascinating feature of Between Camps is its attempt to draw parallels between black and Jewish experiences.

      "bodyText": "Between Camps: Race, Identity and Nationalism at the End of the Colour Line Paul Gilroy Allen Lane \u00a322.50, pp416 Buy it at BOL Earlier this month, Jack Straw took part in a Sunday Times-sponsored debate in London on 'The Growing Threat of the Underclass'. The keynote speaker was the American social scientist Charles Murray, whose best known work, The Bell Curve (1994), manipulated recent genetics research to explain why so many African-Americans were on welfare. Ignoring such petty factors as poor schooling or lack of federal investment, he claimed that the problem lay with the IQ scores of black people which were lower than those of other ethnic groups. Their genes made them stupid. Why are they poor? Literally, it is 'cause they is black. Pathologising black people on spurious evidence is nothing new. Imperialism could not have flourished without it. Kant, in his 'Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and the Sublime', approvingly quoted Hume's assertion that blacks were incapable of producing 'anything great in art or science or any other praiseworthy quality'. Fifty years earlier, Carolus Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist who first classified the natural world, had divided mankind into five categories which casually blurred moral and physical attributes: Europeans were 'gentle, acute, inventive' while Asiatics were 'severe, haughty, covetous' and Africans 'crafty, indolent, negligent'. One of the goals of Between Camps is to look at the crafty and negligent ways in which various European writers have used - and also ignored - the category of 'race' in shaping their ideas about what it is to be modern or even human. Its author, Paul Gilroy, has been one of the consistently interesting thinkers in English academia over the past two decades. Sidestepping the post-structuralist quicksands into which so many of his contemporaries have sunk, he blends sociology, moral philosophy and cultural theory into a heady brew. His work is distinguished not only by its breadth of reference (L\u00e9vinas freestyles with Li'l Kim, while Montaigne gets jiggy wit' Missy Elliott) or by its canny use of puns (Gilroy promotes notions of identity which stress routes rather than roots; it ain't where you're from, it's where you're at), but also by its Utopian vocabulary that invokes the 'yearning' of the disenfranchised peoples it discusses. One of the startling claims Gilroy makes in his new book is that 'race' is on the verge of extinction. Scientists - though not those celebrated by Charles Murray - have not only shown that many disparate ethnic groups hail from the same genetic pool, but that individual tribes in Africa and elsewhere are far more genetically heterogeneous than previously suspected. Strangers among our 'own', newly-affianced to alien peoples - how much longer, asks Gilroy, can we deploy race as a conceptual category? He also questions whether racial theories that have traditionally been founded on negrophobia make much sense now that blackness can 'signify vital prestige rather than abjection in a global info-tainment telesector'. Translated into English, this means that those videos of Puff Daddy flexing and showing out, which MTV spews forth, may help white people think of blacks in a new and positive light. Or perhaps they won't. The Arsenal fans I recently saw on the Tube, interrupted their chorus of 'Spurs are on their way to Auschwitz' to kick a young African student into a bloody pulp. They didn't think their adoration of a black striker such as Nwankwo Kanu obliged them to treat non-football-playing Nigerians with any greater tolerance. Gilroy himself seems to realise this: analysis soon gives way to imprecation as he calls for liberation from 'all racialising and raciological thought, from raciological seeing, racialised thinking, and racialised thinking about thinking'. A particularly fascinating feature of Between Camps is its attempt to draw parallels between black and Jewish experiences. This is an issue of some pertinence in the States, where despite the Jewish contribution to black American creativity (publishers such as Knopf were responsible for issuing the key works of the Harlem Renaissance during the 1920s) and political parity (they helped the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s), Jews have long been regarded as enemies by, among others, the Nation of Islam. Gilroy, however, highlights their shared histories of mass extermination and argues that such sufferings undermine the triumphalist rhetoric of European modernity. He is interested by how these groups, exiled and dispersed both, have developed identities which are based on transmigration and diaspora rather than the litany of blood-soil-roots so often paeaned by nationalists. Gilroy is also keen to attack the body fascist 'biopolitics' of much recent black popular culture. Soul and reggae artists of the past, he claims, tried to create a revolutionary consciousness in their listeners.

Married couples where one is 65 or over also qualify for the married couple's allowance, taking \u00a3200 off your tax bill. </p> <p>Both of these can be increased by what are known as age allowances - although they depend on both age and income level.

This year, the income limit is \u00a317,000. If your total taxable income is above that, the age allowances are reduced by \u00a31 for every \u00a32 of income over the limit. The following examples illustrate how the system works. </p> <p>Harry is single, 66, with an income of \u00a318,000 - \u00a31,000 over the limit. He loses \u00a3500 of the age allowance, taking it to \u00a35,290. On the other hand George, who is married, aged 66, has an income of \u00a320,000 - putting him \u00a33,000 over the limit. This wipes out all his extra \u00a31,405 age allowance, so he can claim only the basic personal allowance of \u00a34,385. </p> <p>He still receives an increased married couple's allowance. Of his \u00a33,000 'excess' income, \u00a32,810 has been set against his personal allowance. That leaves only \u00a3190 to count against his married couple's allowance. </p> <p>If you have income from investments, you may be able to change them to cut your tax bill by qualifying for the higher allowances. Individual savings accounts and national savings certificates both offer tax-free income. But you have to hold savings certificates for at least 12 months to start a regular encashment plan that will pay out tax free. </p> <p>Although you can't put any more money into Peps and Tessas, you can draw the income - without it counting as taxable income. </p> <p>There are several other types of investment which can provide income in a non-taxable form. If you have bought an annuity, the taxman treats part of each payment you get as capital, rather than income. It is not subject to income tax - and can be ignored when it comes to calculating your age allowances. </p> <p>Single-premium life assurance bonds - often known as investment bonds - also offer tax-saving potential.There is no tax liability until the entire bond is cashed or matures, and you can withdraw a sum equal to 5 per cent of the original investment every year for up to 20 years.

His approach - shrugging his shoulders, saying little and walking away - is one of the best ways to deal with this situation. </p> <p><strong> 2:</strong> Accept, however, that there are two types of scapegoating. If you work in the murky worlds of politics or business, then you should not get upset if you come across unfairness. If you are a schemer yourself you will know that the 'blame frame' is just part of the terrain. If, however, you are the innocent victim of a miscarriage of justice then you may need to engage in serious warfare just to keep going. </p> <p><strong> 3:</strong> Decide early on which route you are going to take. If you are going to go quietly, do it with grace. 'Almost invariably, the best thing to do is to shut up and retreat for six months,' says Brendan, a doyen of back-stabbing scenarios. 'Even people who think it is unfair can become embarrassed and will not thank you for saying you've been made a scapegoat.' Mayor Ken Livingstone, the recipient of much of Tony Blair's bile on Old Labour, has strained to appear serene and to avoid saying anything unpleasant about Blair. </p> <p><strong> 4:</strong> Start plotting, if you feel so inclined, about how you can spread the blame to others. You have been rather remiss in letting yourself be scapegoated in the first place - by not maintaining your information systems with colleagues and by neglecting your popularity ratings.

      "bodyText": "1: Understand that less sophisticated societies have a need for scapegoats and sacrificial lambs. Robert Ayling clearly understood this when he was forced out as chair of the Millennium Dome last month. His approach - shrugging his shoulders, saying little and walking away - is one of the best ways to deal with this situation. 2: Accept, however, that there are two types of scapegoating. If you work in the murky worlds of politics or business, then you should not get upset if you come across unfairness. If you are a schemer yourself you will know that the 'blame frame' is just part of the terrain. If, however, you are the innocent victim of a miscarriage of justice then you may need to engage in serious warfare just to keep going. 3: Decide early on which route you are going to take. If you are going to go quietly, do it with grace. 'Almost invariably, the best thing to do is to shut up and retreat for six months,' says Brendan, a doyen of back-stabbing scenarios. 'Even people who think it is unfair can become embarrassed and will not thank you for saying you've been made a scapegoat.' Mayor Ken Livingstone, the recipient of much of Tony Blair's bile on Old Labour, has strained to appear serene and to avoid saying anything unpleasant about Blair. 4: Start plotting, if you feel so inclined, about how you can spread the blame to others. You have been rather remiss in letting yourself be scapegoated in the first place - by not maintaining your information systems with colleagues and by neglecting your popularity ratings. But you can get revenge. You may have evidence of other people's mistakes, for instance. The truly Machiavellian will anonymously leak damaging memos or get other pawns to stumble upon the incriminating documents. Appreciate that some of your tormentors will get their comeuppance: companies with blame cultures repeatedly go through the scapegoating ritual. 5: Consider finding a new job (if you have not lost your post already).

Another option was to choose a with-profits annuity that might offer an increasing level of income in future. But insurance companies are trying to produce new types of annuity, and advisers have reacted enthusiastically to a new product launched last month by Canada Life, which allows investors to use part of their fund to buy an annuity giving guaranteed income for five years and leave the balance of the pension fund invested. After five years, options can reviewed again. </p> <p>When taking your pension - be it money purchase or final salary - it is usually best to take the maximum tax-free cash available, because that money can go into investments such as Isas to produce tax-free income. If taken as pension, it will be taxed. </p> <p>Better-off pensioners may want to start planning to avoid inheritance tax bills for the next generation. Those whose incomes are surplus to what they need to live on are permitted to give money away with no tax bill. </p> <p>Simon Leney at solicitor and investment manager Cripps Harries Hall says: 'If you are 60 and had children in your twenties and thirties they will be 35 or 40 now, and may be earning reasonably well themselves.You could think about school fees planning for grandchildren.

'Look at how much you can afford to give away against the need to pay for long-term care.' </p> <p>Smart says that for people in their seventies, age-related tax allowances become more relevant.

      "body": "<p>Email monitoring is the latest way employers have found to infuriate their staff. Catching out the odd bad apple should not be a source of such irritation to workers as it is. 'Little Hitlers'; 'Like 1984 made real: their systems don't work and they arrest the wrong man'; and 'I've seen many cases, but not one caught by email monitoring'. Those are phrases from managers and lawyers. They control the system: if they feel like that, what do its victims feel like? </p> <p>And there are plenty of victims. A just-published survey by Industrial Relations Services suggests 77 per cent of employers now routinely check to see what websites have been visited by employees. Emails are monitored by 55 per cent of employers. The enhanced powers of MI5 to tap emails may also be suggesting to employers that the Government backs snooping on internet transmissions. </p> <p>But what are employers monitoring, and how? The two problems are the volume of traffic, and how to write software to monitor it. Peter Norbury, employment specialist at law firm Eversheds, says: 'If people are doing 20 emails a day, how do you monitor it? I haven't had a case brought to me that originated with software monitoring.' </p> <p> An urban legend in IT circles concerns the programmer who wrote a program which would automatically delete any email containing certain strings of letters.

      "bodyText": "Email monitoring is the latest way employers have found to infuriate their staff. Catching out the odd bad apple should not be a source of such irritation to workers as it is. 'Little Hitlers'; 'Like 1984 made real: their systems don't work and they arrest the wrong man'; and 'I've seen many cases, but not one caught by email monitoring'. Those are phrases from managers and lawyers. They control the system: if they feel like that, what do its victims feel like? And there are plenty of victims. A just-published survey by Industrial Relations Services suggests 77 per cent of employers now routinely check to see what websites have been visited by employees. Emails are monitored by 55 per cent of employers. The enhanced powers of MI5 to tap emails may also be suggesting to employers that the Government backs snooping on internet transmissions. But what are employers monitoring, and how? The two problems are the volume of traffic, and how to write software to monitor it. Peter Norbury, employment specialist at law firm Eversheds, says: 'If people are doing 20 emails a day, how do you monitor it? I haven't had a case brought to me that originated with software monitoring.' An urban legend in IT circles concerns the programmer who wrote a program which would automatically delete any email containing certain strings of letters. It did not occur to him to specify that there must be a space before and after the strings, and it was several days before his com pany noticed it was unable to communicate with its depot in Scunthorpe.

Although Wasim avoided a life ban, the Qayyum Report concluded that his reputation had been \"sullied\" and that the evidence had \"cast doubts upon his integrity\". Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum further ordered that he should not captain Pakistan again, fined him \u00a33,500 and recommended that his financial affairs should be further investigated. Scrutiny of the report soon persuaded Channel 4 that its credibility would be damaged by the retention of Wasim as a commentator while the match-fixing furore dominates cricket's agenda. Once Pakistan's final test against West Indies in Antigua had been concluded - with, intriguingly, the best bowling figures of Wasim's test career - Wasim was persuaded that his only course of action was to stand down. \"With further investigations ongoing into match-fixing allegations in a number of test-playing countries, the issue is set to dominate the cricketing agenda throughout the summer,\" a Channel 4 statement said last night. \"Channel 4 does not wish to compromise its ability to cover fully and fairly an issue of such fundamental importance to the game, nor does the channel wish to distract attention from this summer's West Indies series. \"After consultations with Channel 4, Wasim Akram has decided that it would be inappropriate to be part of the commentary team this summer and has asked to be released from his contract in order to concentrate on his playing career.\" He will spend the summer playing for Aston Unity in the Birmingham League. Qayyum imposed a life ban on Salim Malik and levied fines on eight players as the match-rigging scandal finally claimed its first high-profile victims. Crucial to the judgment upon Wasim was the withdrawal of a sworn affidavit by Ata-ur-Rehman, who had accused him of involvement in a bookmaker's scam during a one-day international at Christchurch in 1994. Channel 4, meanwhile, is hoping to outbid Sky TV in the race for exclusive use of technology that could eventually be used by international umpires to determine lbw decisions. Hawk-Eye, which can track a cricket ball to within 5mm in under two seconds, is part of a new wave of technological inventions that could leave such recent innovations as Channel 4's red zone and Sky's blue zone redundant.

His omission from the list of contractees remains, as Groucho Marx once put it, a travesty of a travesty. </p> <p>Inevitably, following the rain earlier in the week, the pitch resembled an over-cooked souffle, bad news for those anticipating a masterclass in artful dodgery. Saqlain Mushtaq waited 20 overs for his first wicket and Shane Warne managed only one in 30 before winding up the home innings with his sole delivery yesterday. Warne, who craves firm tracks, has yet to encounter one, which at least partly explains his modest returns. </p> <p>Another factor, of course, has been the Hampshire batting order, for whom brittle would be a compliment, implying as it does a vestige of strength. Subtract Giles White's resilient, occasionally decorative 96 and Adrian Aymes's cussed 44, and the rest of the top seven here aggregated 25 - par for the course. </p> <p>Crucial as it was in averting the follow-on, the fifth-wicket pair's stand of 78 was only Hampshire's fourth half-century stand this term, two of them for the ninth wicket, none of which has managed to complete the full Monty. Even when you have one of Wisden's five cricketers of the century at your beck and call, it helps to give him a few runs to play with. </p> <p>Preying on shaky psyches and mislaid techniques was that evergreen toiler Martin Bicknell, whose two test outings represent arguably the greatest miscarriage of justice since Gloucestershire's Charlie Parker ended his career with 3,278 first-class victims and one token cap. The excuse in his case was a refusal to tug forelock; there have been no such alibis for Bicknell, though he may well curse the day Mrs Fraser gave birth to little Angus. </p> <p>All three of his wickets here, each caught by slips or keeper, were a product of exemplary line and length leavened with a soupcon of outswing, in contrast to the recipe initially followed by Tudor, whose appreciable pace was spoilt by too many four-balls. Having Derek Kenway missed twice off successive balls by Mark Butcher - both stiff asks - did little for his humour, though revenge was swift as Ally Brown swooped at third slip. </p> <p>As the light faded Tudor returned to have Aymes poking to gully, then ripped an inswinger through Warne, enhancing the champions' prospects of a belated first win. The west London Sobers? Don't rule it out.</p>",

Saqlain Mushtaq waited 20 overs for his first wicket and Shane Warne managed only one in 30 before winding up the home innings with his sole delivery yesterday. Warne, who craves firm tracks, has yet to encounter one, which at least partly explains his modest returns. Another factor, of course, has been the Hampshire batting order, for whom brittle would be a compliment, implying as it does a vestige of strength. Subtract Giles White's resilient, occasionally decorative 96 and Adrian Aymes's cussed 44, and the rest of the top seven here aggregated 25 - par for the course. Crucial as it was in averting the follow-on, the fifth-wicket pair's stand of 78 was only Hampshire's fourth half-century stand this term, two of them for the ninth wicket, none of which has managed to complete the full Monty. Even when you have one of Wisden's five cricketers of the century at your beck and call, it helps to give him a few runs to play with. Preying on shaky psyches and mislaid techniques was that evergreen toiler Martin Bicknell, whose two test outings represent arguably the greatest miscarriage of justice since Gloucestershire's Charlie Parker ended his career with 3,278 first-class victims and one token cap. The excuse in his case was a refusal to tug forelock; there have been no such alibis for Bicknell, though he may well curse the day Mrs Fraser gave birth to little Angus. All three of his wickets here, each caught by slips or keeper, were a product of exemplary line and length leavened with a soupcon of outswing, in contrast to the recipe initially followed by Tudor, whose appreciable pace was spoilt by too many four-balls. Having Derek Kenway missed twice off successive balls by Mark Butcher - both stiff asks - did little for his humour, though revenge was swift as Ally Brown swooped at third slip. As the light faded Tudor returned to have Aymes poking to gully, then ripped an inswinger through Warne, enhancing the champions' prospects of a belated first win. The west London Sobers? Don't rule it out.",

      "body": "<p>There was an exultant jangling of civic chains to accompany Kent's third-day resurgence. At the mid-afternoon count, 17 of the county's mayors had arrived in their finery to applaud in regional allegiance as they ate their strawberries and cream. They had outnumbered by one the number of wickets that fell during the sodden stupor of the previous day. </p> <p>The ground staff had miraculously made play possible for this coveted festival match but everyone privately agreed it could never really be a first-class track after being underwater. And as the ball stayed cruelly low, the lbws multiplied alarmingly - with David Constant narrowly ahead of Ray Julian. </p> <p>By yesterday, however, Kent had worked a transformation. They were even able to declare on 237 for nine, leaving Durham a daunting total of 334. </p> <p>The overdue policy for Kent was to attack, though it might mean living with danger. Alan Wells went for a bold shot or two. He lofted over extra cover, first bounce to the boundary; next ball, impatient to repeat his indulgence, he changed his mind too late and lobbed a catch to mid-off. By lunch Kent were 123 for seven: Mark Ealham and Matthew Fleming knew what was required. Between them they changed the course of the contest. </p> <p>With intelligent batting they bucked the game's trends with a stand of 95 before the Kent captain poked an unlikely return catch to Nicky Phillips, seemingly surprised by some bounce.

      "bodyText": "There was an exultant jangling of civic chains to accompany Kent's third-day resurgence. At the mid-afternoon count, 17 of the county's mayors had arrived in their finery to applaud in regional allegiance as they ate their strawberries and cream. They had outnumbered by one the number of wickets that fell during the sodden stupor of the previous day. The ground staff had miraculously made play possible for this coveted festival match but everyone privately agreed it could never really be a first-class track after being underwater. And as the ball stayed cruelly low, the lbws multiplied alarmingly - with David Constant narrowly ahead of Ray Julian. By yesterday, however, Kent had worked a transformation. They were even able to declare on 237 for nine, leaving Durham a daunting total of 334. The overdue policy for Kent was to attack, though it might mean living with danger. Alan Wells went for a bold shot or two. He lofted over extra cover, first bounce to the boundary; next ball, impatient to repeat his indulgence, he changed his mind too late and lobbed a catch to mid-off. By lunch Kent were 123 for seven: Mark Ealham and Matthew Fleming knew what was required. Between them they changed the course of the contest. With intelligent batting they bucked the game's trends with a stand of 95 before the Kent captain poked an unlikely return catch to Nicky Phillips, seemingly surprised by some bounce. That was perhaps the most decisive partnership, though Min Patel's with Ealham was almost as valuable. In a sparky innings, Patel pulled Phillips for the match's only six. Ealham remained in charge for just over four hours, relishing the chance to show those sturdy square-cuts while doing his best to wrest the initiative from tiring bowlers. Durham's hopes were receding by the over. They looked deficient of effective bowling options. The slow bowlers found a little turn; things were by now easier at the crease.

Even those who had been straining at the leash to get in the first bite at the England coach's ankles were wagging their tails. </p> <p>Certainly Keegan's switch from 4-4-2 to playing three at the back with five in midfield produced greater attacking fluency compared to the more rigid performance in last Saturday's 1-1 draw with Brazil. But it did not settle the arguments about what pattern England should adopt against Portugal on Monday week. </p> <p>Systems will always be contentious but are only part of the argument. Teams win international tournaments because of the quality of their players rather than the way they play. It is the players who make successful systems, not the other way round. </p> <p>England did not win the World Cup in 1966 just because Alf Ramsey did away with conventional wingers and employed Bobby Charlton in a central role behind the front runners. In fact, for their opening two games of that tournament Ramsey had first John Connelly on the left wing, then Terry Paine on the right. </p> <p>Ramsey's genius lay in a readiness to adapt which, by the final against West Germany, found Alan Ball and Martin Peters working the flanks and tucking in to defend as wing-halves, Charlton prepared to subjugate his own attacking instincts so long as Franz Beckenbauer kept him company, and Geoff Hurst winning lasting fame after nearly missing the World Cup because he had shown poor control on a bumpy pitch in Copenhagen shortly before it began. </p> <p>Would that Keegan could enjoy some of Ramsey's options. On England's only previous visit to Malta, for a European Championship qualifier in 1971, Colin Harvey, then part of an outstanding midfield threesome at Everton, won what was to be his only international cap. Howard Kendall, who with Ball completed the trio, never played for England. </p> <p>Ball was capped 72 times and it seems reasonable to assume the modern equivalents of Harvey and Kendall would win more than one cap between them. At least in Paul Scholes Keegan has a midfielder with something of all three about him, in addition to the goalscoring instincts of David Platt and the drive of Bryan Robson. </p> <p>Perhaps Keegan is deeper than most would imagine. Maybe his sudden enthusiasm for making Steve McManaman the centre of the universe is a cunning ploy to divert the attention away from Scholes. </p> <p>Certainly it looked that way at Wembley on Wednesday night. McManaman's influence was as peripheral as it will always be when he is tethered to the left wing, while Scholes caused the Ukrainians far more problems through the middle. </p> <p>However Keegan decides to play it in Euro 2000, the success of his team will depend in part on the amount of freedom Scholes is given. Against Brazil he was told not to get on his bike but play a holding role. Against Ukraine he worked in tandem with Robbie Fowler and the effect was electric. </p> <p>Then there is the catalyst, Nick Barmby, who on Wednesday replaced Scholes for the last 17 minutes and immediately provided the element of surprise which has been so rare in England's football since Michael Owen sped past Argentina's defenders in St Etienne two years ago. </p> <p>One school of thought argues that Keegan should consider playing Owen alone up front with Scholes, Fowler or Barmby tucking in behind. Certainly the England coach will have to reorganise his attack once Alan Shearer has retired from internationals after Euro 2000. </p> <p>Or it may be before then. Against Brazil and Ukraine the England captain was keen and alert, playing an essential part in the three goals scored by England in those games. When it comes to alternative strikers, however, Keegan is better off than most of his Euro 2000 rivals and has already made it clear he would be prepared to drop Shearer if necessary. </p> <p>Equally Shearer has made few bones about his preference for Emile Heskey as a partner up front. After Heskey's galumphing, artless intervention on Wednesday that is a sobering thought. So is the image of high balls being pumped towards the pair against defences able to cope with this sort of thing in their sleep. Either way there must be more to England's game than Beckham's crosses. </p> <p>A personal feeling is that Keegan should start with Shearer and Owen and use Scholes in close support as an attacking midfielder, while Paul Ince drops anchor in front of a back four. In other words a diamond which need not be for ever but might turn out to be Scholes's best friend.</p>",

However Keegan decides to play it in Euro 2000, the success of his team will depend in part on the amount of freedom Scholes is given. Against Brazil he was told not to get on his bike but play a holding role. Against Ukraine he worked in tandem with Robbie Fowler and the effect was electric. Then there is the catalyst, Nick Barmby, who on Wednesday replaced Scholes for the last 17 minutes and immediately provided the element of surprise which has been so rare in England's football since Michael Owen sped past Argentina's defenders in St Etienne two years ago. One school of thought argues that Keegan should consider playing Owen alone up front with Scholes, Fowler or Barmby tucking in behind. Certainly the England coach will have to reorganise his attack once Alan Shearer has retired from internationals after Euro 2000. Or it may be before then. Against Brazil and Ukraine the England captain was keen and alert, playing an essential part in the three goals scored by England in those games. When it comes to alternative strikers, however, Keegan is better off than most of his Euro 2000 rivals and has already made it clear he would be prepared to drop Shearer if necessary. Equally Shearer has made few bones about his preference for Emile Heskey as a partner up front. After Heskey's galumphing, artless intervention on Wednesday that is a sobering thought. So is the image of high balls being pumped towards the pair against defences able to cope with this sort of thing in their sleep. Either way there must be more to England's game than Beckham's crosses. A personal feeling is that Keegan should start with Shearer and Owen and use Scholes in close support as an attacking midfielder, while Paul Ince drops anchor in front of a back four. In other words a diamond which need not be for ever but might turn out to be Scholes's best friend.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Grand Place, Brussels </strong></p> <p>A week tonight, on the edge of a Belgian square the size of a football pitch, Paul-David Hollander will reach for his first batch of 5,000 plastic glasses and start praying. As the new co-owner of a bar called Petit Paon, the Little Peacock, Hollander's prayer will be laced with hope and fear. </p> <p>At exactly 8.45pm local time, just as darkness spreads across the city centre, the beery hum will deepen into a roar as Euro 2000 finally begins in Brussels. Yet, for Hollander, there is personal relief that next Saturday's opening match between Belgium and Sweden will mark a low-key start compared to the fevered nights ahead. </p> <p>\"We can prepare ourselves for good business and maybe just a little trouble,\" the 24-year-old suggests. \"We'll get a lot of Swedish fans in the square - and maybe even some Belgians. But it will be much busier when the other countries arrive. And, of course, the English are different. They drink the biggest jugs of beer.\" </p> <p>Once England have played Portugal in Eindhoven on June 12, their travelling army will descend on Brussels. Grand Place, fringed by huge outdoor bars and side-streets crammed with restaurants, will mark the drinking point for thousands of fans who use Brussels as a base during England's two remaining group matches in the small town of Charleroi - a 40-minute train journey away. </p> <p>German supporters will also move into Brussels a week on Tuesday, ready for their potentially decisive clash against England two weeks tonight. They will be followed by Turkish fans. The stark ingredients for violence are obvious. </p> <p>Even when it is empty, it is not difficult to imagine Grand Place as a battleground. It is likely that a mass outbreak of fighting will reel down the adjoining lanes - such as rue Chair et Pain. Apart from Hollander's little bar, the rest of that pretty if touristy street is lined with 35 restaurants. </p> <p>Competition is fierce. It is impossible to walk down rue Chair et Pain and escape the smiling enticement of each new greeter. He points to his own eye-catching display of seafood and fruit on crushed ice and says \"hello\" with such seductive determination you fear the words \"big boy\" creeping up in breathless pursuit of your custom. </p> <p>Until they start smashing through the exotic pyramids of food, a mildly inter esting exchange might unfold between the hoolie-mobs of Euro 2000 and those desperately grinning doormen. Yet a far more disturbing image sees gangs of men cracking each other's heads open against the loose cobble-stoned paving. </p> <p>\"But maybe,\" Hollander nods hopefully, \"the fans will stay happy and we will make money.\" Hollander's commercial ambitions spring from his memory of the night three months ago when Grand Place turned orange. \"I'd just bought this bar when Belgium played Holland. The square outside was full of Dutch fans. So many of them came here after the match that I had to keep my hand on the beer pump until four in the morning. Maybe we will have more great nights like that . . .\" </p> <p> <strong> Stade Communal, Charleroi</strong> </p> <p> The stadium rises suddenly out of the rainy mist. Its steep red banks climb at such a sharp angle that, staring upwards, a temporary third tier looks more like a vertical wall of seats. The dizzying sight is deepened by the fact that the Stade Communal is hemmed in on three sides by different apartment blocks. </p> <p>Only a narrow road seems to have prevented the constructors from setting the newly redeveloped ground flush against the wall of each bricked building. This is not some kind of compact and soaring homage to the study of claustrophobia and vertigo in Belgium. The truth is more basic. </p> <p>There is not enough land on this particular site to build a conventional stadium with a 30,000 capacity for Euro 2000. Without the option of spreading outwards and rising at a more gradual gradient, the designers have aimed straight upwards and pulled off a dubious trick in squeezing 22,000 backless bucket seats into such a constricted space. They have heightened the danger by adding a top layer of 8,000 seats which will be removed after England's final group match against Romania. </p> <p>The view from row 21 of level three provides an undeniably panoramic view. Yet if anyone is injured in this matchstick-like upper tier, mountain-rescue teams will have to be brought in - and hopefully not those crack units from the Belgian lowlands. When they recently conducted an emergency drill in an empty stadium, it took 20 minutes for a mock-victim to be rescued. How they would cope when confronted with a terrified throng in the event of a stadium disaster is more unsettling. </p> <p>The threat to those in the lowest sections is equally severe. Spectators in the front row will be less than a foot from the perimeter fencing. The fatal lessons of Hillsborough have been ignored. There will be no escape on to the pitch for anyone pushed up against the two-metre high metal barrier by an avalanche of falling bodies. </p> <p>Raymond Hens, the cigar-chomping head of stadium security, dismisses such anxiety. His permanent position as the director of prisons in Charleroi may explain his bluff tough-guy persona. Yet he appears strangely naive when addressing the recent history of footballing tragedy. \"I don't see us having any problem here,\" Hens argues. \"We tested the stadium in an international match like this and everything was OK.\" </p> <p>The fact that Hens should use a midweek friendly between Belgium and Portugal as some kind of security yardstick for a European Championship match between England and Germany would be laughable if it were not so hazardous. \"I understand English fans,\" Hens protests. \"They live for football matches against Germany. It is lovely. Yes, sometimes there is also trouble. But we have German fans on one side and English on the other. Up on the third level there will only be neutrals. So we have no problems there. Kevin Keegan says our ground is like the Stadium of Light.\" </p> <p>The Stade Communal is more like Euro 2000's definitive Stadium of Darkness - a point which has been made repeatedly by both Belgian politicians and policemen. Yet many people in Charleroi endorse Uefa's blunt refusal to move the match to Brussels. Jean-Yves Roquet is one of the more interesting voices. An unmissable 24-stone optician who runs his own business from the centre of town, Roquet is both a footballing sophisticate and man so friendly he only has to hear a few words of English to offer an impromptu tour of his beloved Charleroi. </p> <p>\"A lot of people fear Euro 2000,\" Roquet concedes. \"But then people like me are so proud the biggest group match is taking place in our town. It's very exciting.\" Roquet managed to buy 40 tickets for various Euro 2000 matches on the internet - including half a dozen for both England games in Charleroi. </p> <p>While emphatic that he and his friends will use at least four tickets for June 17, he admits that, like many others, he will sell his spare pair to English or German fans. The idea of a \"neutral zone\" is shattered by such an inevitable revelation. </p> <p>As a ticket-holder for the tragic European Cup final at Heysel in 1985, Roquet stresses the need to make a \"responsible\" black-market sale. \"My Heysel ticket is still at home,\" he says. \"It's a reminder. My father died the day before that match and so I did not go. But we cannot forget. That's why this tournament is so important to Belgian football. We cannot afford another disaster.\" </p> <p>In an attempt to end our day in Charleroi on a more upbeat note, Roquet sweeps through town in search of Philippe Albert. It does not takes long to find Charleroi's favourite son in a bar not far from the Stade Communal. \"Newcastle always reminded me of a bigger version of Charleroi,\" Albert suggests. \"This is an industrial town but it is so friendly. I always tell everyone it is a fascinating place.\" </p> <p>Within minutes there is sudden confirmation that Charleroi is indeed more than a boring little Belgian town. A local resident, infuriated by Belgium's 60% tax rate, has just set fire to his car. He then storms into the tax office and shoots three people, holding a further five hostage. As Charleroi swarms with machine-gun wielding policemen, a full-scale siege seems as good a time as any to head for Holland. </p> <p>\"Charleroi is not normally this exciting,\" its enormous optician murmured. \"I just hope it's more boring when England and Germany arrive.\" </p> <p> <strong> Golden Tulip Hotel, Hoenderloo</strong> </p> <p> Travelling through Belgium and Holland by train, the flatlands blur convincingly. For once, Euro 2000's marketing slogan of Football Without Frontiers seems more apt than vacuous. Yet the perennial threat of hooliganism forced a debate this week in both countries over the possible reintroduction of border controls. </p> <p>For now, however, the most distinct boundary is one of mood. If Belgium seems drizzly and apprehensive in its approach to Euro 2000, Holland is ablaze with colourful exuberance. Even if the adjoining towns initially look remarkably similar, each stop at a new station displays an increasing flash of orange and the gathering chatter in Dutch of a likely victory. </p> <p>Once you pass Arnhem and then meander into the countryside near Hoenderloo, the quiet returns. The tranquility is deepest in the woods and secluded grounds of the hotel where the Dutch squad will set up camp once they return from Zurich on Monday. The expectations of a nation still stand out brightly in the surrounding silence. </p> <p>\"Oranje success\" is spelt out in a gigantic flower-bed. \"These are the first words the Dutch team will see when they arrive,\" Arlette Gilbert smiles serenely. As the sales manager of the Golden Tulip as well as the main organiser of training camp facilities, Gilbert exudes the sleek charm and confidence which seems to characterise the official Dutch promotion of Euro 2000. </p> <p>\"We are very hopeful of 'orange success',\" she murmurs, \"but it is also important that we create the right kind of environment for the team. One of my responsibilities is to control the daily media gatherings. As we move towards the final we expect around 450 reporters a day. We will look after the press, but the team comes first.\" </p> <p>The Golden Tulip specialises in pampering professional footballers - with Barcelona being one of many leading European clubs to regularly use the complex as a training base. Yet there is more than pure business at work in the meticulous year of planning which, Gilbert says, \"has taken into account every single aspect of our next four weeks. We've pulled out all stops for the team in orange.\" </p> <p>Gilbert conducts a mini-tour of the chalet-style house \"where Frank Rijkaard will live for the next month and plan his campaign\", as well as the players' individual rooms, each with \"its own patio and English garden\". There is also the perfect training pitch, with a surface superior to that which England and Germany will play on in Charleroi, a volleyball court and the deep blue swimming pool - once you've escaped the gym, the treatment room and the video-analysis lounge. </p> <p>The only problem for a national footballing psyche which traditionally thrives on training camp bust-ups would appear to be the myriad of boardrooms offering ample opportunity for rival groups to plot the next twist in an enduring power struggle. Even this hugely entertaining Dutch quirk has, at least for now, been subsumed in a seemingly effortless drive towards \"oranje success\". </p> <p> <strong> Oranjeloo (Orange Town)</strong> </p> <p> Who needs Edgar Davids or Clarence Seedorf to go on strike when Holland have already given us the surreal suburban genius of Oranjeloo? </p> <p>\"We are only a very small community of 1,700 people in Hoenderloo,\" explains Jan Wolffensperger, the nominal head of the village, \"and our idea is a simple one. There can be no greater honour than to have the Dutch team based just outside Hoenderloo. We met with Co Adriaanse who has just been appointed the new coach of Ajax, and he suggested we change our name to Oranjeloo. </p> <p>\"So throughout Euro 2000 the town will only be referred to as Oranjeloo. At the same time we have decided to turn the town orange. Come, I will show you . . .\" </p> <p>To jump on an orange tandem in the company of big Jan, who has slipped on his Euro 2000 clogs specially for the occasion, and cycle through Oranjeloo on a summer afternoon is to disappear into an incredible world. If David Lynch had discovered Dutch football first he might have made, rather than Blue Velvet, a deeply strange film called Orange Town. </p> <p>As we drift beneath fluttering orange bunting and past houses draped in orange decorations, smiling families step out into their sunlit gardens to wave and shout \"Hup, hup, Holland!\" </p> <p>Wim Barten and his wife Riek calmly welcome us into a home which has been converted into the Jaap Stam Bar. Their front garden may have been taken over by a flowered shrine to Euro 2000 but, next to the front door, a life-sized cardboard cut-out of Dennis Bergkamp serving drinks behind Jaap's bar is more eye-catching. Bottles of Dennis Beer glint on the counter. </p> <p>Around the corner, in a garden belonging to Sandra Renata, the July 2 final of Euro 2000 is already underway - as Holland play France in Rotterdam. The pitch is 12ft by 8ft and all 22 players are three inches tall. Miniature sponsor boards from businesses around the village line the edge of the field while, at night, the foot-high floodlights illuminate a final set to last an entire month. </p> <p>Even at the level of Subutteo in Oranjeloo, you can pick out the individual stars of Euro 2000 - and it has be said that the Dutch look as if they can pull off a motionless swagger at will. Nicolas Anelka, in contrast, is even more miserable in Orange Town than he was in either north London or Madrid. Thierry Henry is stuck in the mud. Emmanuel Petit has lost his pony-tail. Fabien Barthez, just in from Manchester, is scratching his head at the sight of the Dutch on permanent attack. </p> <p>A couple of times a day the people of Oranjeloo move the Dutch players around - just to prove that Holland are a far more fluid outfit than the statuesque world cup holders. </p> <p>There is only one cloud in Oranjeloo. Partick Kluivert is missing. The chief suspect is Sandra Renata's black Labrador - Joy. They have not quite printed the shock headline of Dog Eats Kluivert in fear of an even more distressing truth: Joy Buries Kluivert Alive. </p> <p>Yet, as Jan Wolffensperger insists, \"Kluivert or no Kluivert, we will still win this game! \"There is sudden urgency on the touchline. Even the man-sized dummy of Frank Rijkaard seems to twitch in his suit and tie as Sandra drops the ball at Marc Overmars's feet. </p> <p>\"Bergkamp is waiting to score the winning goal in Rotterdam,\" Jan croons, \"and here comes the centre . . .\" But here comes Joy, swooping in on Overmars like Tony Adams in disguise. And there goes Overmars, swallowed up by the jaws of fate. Joy for Joy; despair for Holland. </p> <p>Except, a week before Euro 2000, it's still possible to give a black dog a red card in Oranjeloo. Overmars is returned safely to the left wing, the ball at his feet, and the longest championship in history awaits another winning Euro 2000 goal from Dennis Bergkamp. After, all in Orange Town, far more than Brussels, they're ready and drooling.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Grand Place, Brussels A week tonight, on the edge of a Belgian square the size of a football pitch, Paul-David Hollander will reach for his first batch of 5,000 plastic glasses and start praying. As the new co-owner of a bar called Petit Paon, the Little Peacock, Hollander's prayer will be laced with hope and fear. At exactly 8.45pm local time, just as darkness spreads across the city centre, the beery hum will deepen into a roar as Euro 2000 finally begins in Brussels. Yet, for Hollander, there is personal relief that next Saturday's opening match between Belgium and Sweden will mark a low-key start compared to the fevered nights ahead. \"We can prepare ourselves for good business and maybe just a little trouble,\" the 24-year-old suggests. \"We'll get a lot of Swedish fans in the square - and maybe even some Belgians. But it will be much busier when the other countries arrive. And, of course, the English are different. They drink the biggest jugs of beer.\" Once England have played Portugal in Eindhoven on June 12, their travelling army will descend on Brussels. Grand Place, fringed by huge outdoor bars and side-streets crammed with restaurants, will mark the drinking point for thousands of fans who use Brussels as a base during England's two remaining group matches in the small town of Charleroi - a 40-minute train journey away. German supporters will also move into Brussels a week on Tuesday, ready for their potentially decisive clash against England two weeks tonight. They will be followed by Turkish fans. The stark ingredients for violence are obvious. Even when it is empty, it is not difficult to imagine Grand Place as a battleground. It is likely that a mass outbreak of fighting will reel down the adjoining lanes - such as rue Chair et Pain. Apart from Hollander's little bar, the rest of that pretty if touristy street is lined with 35 restaurants. Competition is fierce. It is impossible to walk down rue Chair et Pain and escape the smiling enticement of each new greeter. He points to his own eye-catching display of seafood and fruit on crushed ice and says \"hello\" with such seductive determination you fear the words \"big boy\" creeping up in breathless pursuit of your custom. Until they start smashing through the exotic pyramids of food, a mildly inter esting exchange might unfold between the hoolie-mobs of Euro 2000 and those desperately grinning doormen. Yet a far more disturbing image sees gangs of men cracking each other's heads open against the loose cobble-stoned paving. \"But maybe,\" Hollander nods hopefully, \"the fans will stay happy and we will make money.\" Hollander's commercial ambitions spring from his memory of the night three months ago when Grand Place turned orange. \"I'd just bought this bar when Belgium played Holland. The square outside was full of Dutch fans. So many of them came here after the match that I had to keep my hand on the beer pump until four in the morning. Maybe we will have more great nights like that . . .\" Stade Communal, Charleroi The stadium rises suddenly out of the rainy mist. Its steep red banks climb at such a sharp angle that, staring upwards, a temporary third tier looks more like a vertical wall of seats. The dizzying sight is deepened by the fact that the Stade Communal is hemmed in on three sides by different apartment blocks. Only a narrow road seems to have prevented the constructors from setting the newly redeveloped ground flush against the wall of each bricked building. This is not some kind of compact and soaring homage to the study of claustrophobia and vertigo in Belgium. The truth is more basic. There is not enough land on this particular site to build a conventional stadium with a 30,000 capacity for Euro 2000. Without the option of spreading outwards and rising at a more gradual gradient, the designers have aimed straight upwards and pulled off a dubious trick in squeezing 22,000 backless bucket seats into such a constricted space. They have heightened the danger by adding a top layer of 8,000 seats which will be removed after England's final group match against Romania. The view from row 21 of level three provides an undeniably panoramic view. Yet if anyone is injured in this matchstick-like upper tier, mountain-rescue teams will have to be brought in - and hopefully not those crack units from the Belgian lowlands. When they recently conducted an emergency drill in an empty stadium, it took 20 minutes for a mock-victim to be rescued. How they would cope when confronted with a terrified throng in the event of a stadium disaster is more unsettling. The threat to those in the lowest sections is equally severe. Spectators in the front row will be less than a foot from the perimeter fencing. The fatal lessons of Hillsborough have been ignored. There will be no escape on to the pitch for anyone pushed up against the two-metre high metal barrier by an avalanche of falling bodies. Raymond Hens, the cigar-chomping head of stadium security, dismisses such anxiety. His permanent position as the director of prisons in Charleroi may explain his bluff tough-guy persona. Yet he appears strangely naive when addressing the recent history of footballing tragedy. \"I don't see us having any problem here,\" Hens argues. \"We tested the stadium in an international match like this and everything was OK.\" The fact that Hens should use a midweek friendly between Belgium and Portugal as some kind of security yardstick for a European Championship match between England and Germany would be laughable if it were not so hazardous. \"I understand English fans,\" Hens protests. \"They live for football matches against Germany. It is lovely. Yes, sometimes there is also trouble. But we have German fans on one side and English on the other. Up on the third level there will only be neutrals. So we have no problems there. Kevin Keegan says our ground is like the Stadium of Light.\" The Stade Communal is more like Euro 2000's definitive Stadium of Darkness - a point which has been made repeatedly by both Belgian politicians and policemen. Yet many people in Charleroi endorse Uefa's blunt refusal to move the match to Brussels. Jean-Yves Roquet is one of the more interesting voices. An unmissable 24-stone optician who runs his own business from the centre of town, Roquet is both a footballing sophisticate and man so friendly he only has to hear a few words of English to offer an impromptu tour of his beloved Charleroi. \"A lot of people fear Euro 2000,\" Roquet concedes. \"But then people like me are so proud the biggest group match is taking place in our town. It's very exciting.\" Roquet managed to buy 40 tickets for various Euro 2000 matches on the internet - including half a dozen for both England games in Charleroi. While emphatic that he and his friends will use at least four tickets for June 17, he admits that, like many others, he will sell his spare pair to English or German fans. The idea of a \"neutral zone\" is shattered by such an inevitable revelation. As a ticket-holder for the tragic European Cup final at Heysel in 1985, Roquet stresses the need to make a \"responsible\" black-market sale. \"My Heysel ticket is still at home,\" he says. \"It's a reminder. My father died the day before that match and so I did not go. But we cannot forget. That's why this tournament is so important to Belgian football. We cannot afford another disaster.\" In an attempt to end our day in Charleroi on a more upbeat note, Roquet sweeps through town in search of Philippe Albert. It does not takes long to find Charleroi's favourite son in a bar not far from the Stade Communal. \"Newcastle always reminded me of a bigger version of Charleroi,\" Albert suggests. \"This is an industrial town but it is so friendly. I always tell everyone it is a fascinating place.\" Within minutes there is sudden confirmation that Charleroi is indeed more than a boring little Belgian town. A local resident, infuriated by Belgium's 60% tax rate, has just set fire to his car. He then storms into the tax office and shoots three people, holding a further five hostage. As Charleroi swarms with machine-gun wielding policemen, a full-scale siege seems as good a time as any to head for Holland. \"Charleroi is not normally this exciting,\" its enormous optician murmured. \"I just hope it's more boring when England and Germany arrive.\" Golden Tulip Hotel, Hoenderloo Travelling through Belgium and Holland by train, the flatlands blur convincingly. For once, Euro 2000's marketing slogan of Football Without Frontiers seems more apt than vacuous. Yet the perennial threat of hooliganism forced a debate this week in both countries over the possible reintroduction of border controls. For now, however, the most distinct boundary is one of mood. If Belgium seems drizzly and apprehensive in its approach to Euro 2000, Holland is ablaze with colourful exuberance. Even if the adjoining towns initially look remarkably similar, each stop at a new station displays an increasing flash of orange and the gathering chatter in Dutch of a likely victory. Once you pass Arnhem and then meander into the countryside near Hoenderloo, the quiet returns. The tranquility is deepest in the woods and secluded grounds of the hotel where the Dutch squad will set up camp once they return from Zurich on Monday. The expectations of a nation still stand out brightly in the surrounding silence. \"Oranje success\" is spelt out in a gigantic flower-bed. \"These are the first words the Dutch team will see when they arrive,\" Arlette Gilbert smiles serenely. As the sales manager of the Golden Tulip as well as the main organiser of training camp facilities, Gilbert exudes the sleek charm and confidence which seems to characterise the official Dutch promotion of Euro 2000. \"We are very hopeful of 'orange success',\" she murmurs, \"but it is also important that we create the right kind of environment for the team. One of my responsibilities is to control the daily media gatherings. As we move towards the final we expect around 450 reporters a day. We will look after the press, but the team comes first.\" The Golden Tulip specialises in pampering professional footballers - with Barcelona being one of many leading European clubs to regularly use the complex as a training base. Yet there is more than pure business at work in the meticulous year of planning which, Gilbert says, \"has taken into account every single aspect of our next four weeks. We've pulled out all stops for the team in orange.\" Gilbert conducts a mini-tour of the chalet-style house \"where Frank Rijkaard will live for the next month and plan his campaign\", as well as the players' individual rooms, each with \"its own patio and English garden\". There is also the perfect training pitch, with a surface superior to that which England and Germany will play on in Charleroi, a volleyball court and the deep blue swimming pool - once you've escaped the gym, the treatment room and the video-analysis lounge. The only problem for a national footballing psyche which traditionally thrives on training camp bust-ups would appear to be the myriad of boardrooms offering ample opportunity for rival groups to plot the next twist in an enduring power struggle. Even this hugely entertaining Dutch quirk has, at least for now, been subsumed in a seemingly effortless drive towards \"oranje success\". Oranjeloo (Orange Town) Who needs Edgar Davids or Clarence Seedorf to go on strike when Holland have already given us the surreal suburban genius of Oranjeloo? \"We are only a very small community of 1,700 people in Hoenderloo,\" explains Jan Wolffensperger, the nominal head of the village, \"and our idea is a simple one. There can be no greater honour than to have the Dutch team based just outside Hoenderloo. We met with Co Adriaanse who has just been appointed the new coach of Ajax, and he suggested we change our name to Oranjeloo. \"So throughout Euro 2000 the town will only be referred to as Oranjeloo. At the same time we have decided to turn the town orange. Come, I will show you . . .\" To jump on an orange tandem in the company of big Jan, who has slipped on his Euro 2000 clogs specially for the occasion, and cycle through Oranjeloo on a summer afternoon is to disappear into an incredible world. If David Lynch had discovered Dutch football first he might have made, rather than Blue Velvet, a deeply strange film called Orange Town. As we drift beneath fluttering orange bunting and past houses draped in orange decorations, smiling families step out into their sunlit gardens to wave and shout \"Hup, hup, Holland!\" Wim Barten and his wife Riek calmly welcome us into a home which has been converted into the Jaap Stam Bar. Their front garden may have been taken over by a flowered shrine to Euro 2000 but, next to the front door, a life-sized cardboard cut-out of Dennis Bergkamp serving drinks behind Jaap's bar is more eye-catching. Bottles of Dennis Beer glint on the counter. Around the corner, in a garden belonging to Sandra Renata, the July 2 final of Euro 2000 is already underway - as Holland play France in Rotterdam. The pitch is 12ft by 8ft and all 22 players are three inches tall. Miniature sponsor boards from businesses around the village line the edge of the field while, at night, the foot-high floodlights illuminate a final set to last an entire month. Even at the level of Subutteo in Oranjeloo, you can pick out the individual stars of Euro 2000 - and it has be said that the Dutch look as if they can pull off a motionless swagger at will. Nicolas Anelka, in contrast, is even more miserable in Orange Town than he was in either north London or Madrid. Thierry Henry is stuck in the mud. Emmanuel Petit has lost his pony-tail. Fabien Barthez, just in from Manchester, is scratching his head at the sight of the Dutch on permanent attack. A couple of times a day the people of Oranjeloo move the Dutch players around - just to prove that Holland are a far more fluid outfit than the statuesque world cup holders. There is only one cloud in Oranjeloo. Partick Kluivert is missing. The chief suspect is Sandra Renata's black Labrador - Joy. They have not quite printed the shock headline of Dog Eats Kluivert in fear of an even more distressing truth: Joy Buries Kluivert Alive. Yet, as Jan Wolffensperger insists, \"Kluivert or no Kluivert, we will still win this game! \"There is sudden urgency on the touchline. Even the man-sized dummy of Frank Rijkaard seems to twitch in his suit and tie as Sandra drops the ball at Marc Overmars's feet. \"Bergkamp is waiting to score the winning goal in Rotterdam,\" Jan croons, \"and here comes the centre . . .\" But here comes Joy, swooping in on Overmars like Tony Adams in disguise. And there goes Overmars, swallowed up by the jaws of fate. Joy for Joy; despair for Holland. Except, a week before Euro 2000, it's still possible to give a black dog a red card in Oranjeloo. Overmars is returned safely to the left wing, the ball at his feet, and the longest championship in history awaits another winning Euro 2000 goal from Dennis Bergkamp. After, all in Orange Town, far more than Brussels, they're ready and drooling.",

      "body": "<p>Compared with England's efforts in recent years, today was a roaring success. But compared with Lord's it was no more than satisfactory. True, England scored 374. But, two Lancastrians excepted, the lack of urgency in the batting (just 19 runs in the first eight overs after tea when it should have been hit out or get out) suggested Nasser hadn't seen the weather forecast for tomorrow. The two cheap wickets they took in the evening gloom will be meaningless if the rain returns to ruin Sunday.</p> <p>Still, first-innings totals of 300-plus don't come easily, and England have now done it four times in their last six Tests. The man responsible for them getting there today was Iron Mike Atherton - with a little help from his friend Chris Schofield. Atherton's square-driving was the high-point of the innings, and, until he went a bit quiet just before his dismissal, he batted as fluently as he has done for England since the 1998 series against South Africa. </p> <p>Trent Bridge seems to bring the best out of him, and today he equalled Denis Compton's record of five Test hundreds at the ground. Athers began his Test career there with a duck against the 1989 Aussies, but since then he has been at his rock-like best. Subsequent scores of 47, 151, 32, 4, 11, 9, 101, 113, 43, 160, 27, 8, 58, 98* and now 136 give him 998 Nottingham runs at 66.53 - stats that only Don Bradman would sniff at.</p> <p>On a day when batting should have been harder than it was, Schofield's cheeky, chirpy 57 was the other bonus for England - even if his footwork wouldn't be out of place at the Bolshoi.

      "bodyText": "Compared with England's efforts in recent years, today was a roaring success. But compared with Lord's it was no more than satisfactory. True, England scored 374. But, two Lancastrians excepted, the lack of urgency in the batting (just 19 runs in the first eight overs after tea when it should have been hit out or get out) suggested Nasser hadn't seen the weather forecast for tomorrow. The two cheap wickets they took in the evening gloom will be meaningless if the rain returns to ruin Sunday. Still, first-innings totals of 300-plus don't come easily, and England have now done it four times in their last six Tests. The man responsible for them getting there today was Iron Mike Atherton - with a little help from his friend Chris Schofield. Atherton's square-driving was the high-point of the innings, and, until he went a bit quiet just before his dismissal, he batted as fluently as he has done for England since the 1998 series against South Africa. Trent Bridge seems to bring the best out of him, and today he equalled Denis Compton's record of five Test hundreds at the ground. Athers began his Test career there with a duck against the 1989 Aussies, but since then he has been at his rock-like best. Subsequent scores of 47, 151, 32, 4, 11, 9, 101, 113, 43, 160, 27, 8, 58, 98* and now 136 give him 998 Nottingham runs at 66.53 - stats that only Don Bradman would sniff at. On a day when batting should have been harder than it was, Schofield's cheeky, chirpy 57 was the other bonus for England - even if his footwork wouldn't be out of place at the Bolshoi. Zimbabwe's main problem was controlling the lavish swing which is sometimes a feature of this ground: it's not often you find 16 wides in ther extras column. And the figure could have been higher. England's middle order was anonymous. Which, paradoxically, might not be such a bad thing: the fact that Hussain, Graeme Hick, Alec Stewart, Nick Knight and Andy Flintoff made 52 between them adds extra gloss to Mark Ramprakash's opening-day 56.

I asked a policeman where I could buy an Ajax shirt and he took me across town to a shop; that shirt was my prized possession and I played in it until it fell apart.

So it's good to see the striking English actress front and centre again in the romance Return To Me, even if she is playing a woman who thinks she has a lot to hide. Driver plays a Chicago waitress who receives a heart transplant, and is embarrassed to let the first man in her life (David Duchovny) know.

The notion of that naivety and innocence, and the detail of the mundane becoming incredibly extraordinary... Riding a bicycle is like climbing Everest for her. There was also the notion of gratitude and fury, her rage about not being able to be unhappy. She has bad days and feels guilty about having bad days. I mean, somebody died for her.

That stuff all came a lot later. Circle Of Friends was just another job, I had nothing to lose. I don't even know that I've got a lot to lose now, because it's sort of the kind of thing that you can get back. I probably wouldn't enter into gaining a lot of weight lightly; I'd have a lot more concern about it now, just because I'm older and whatever. But that's not to say that you can't or I wouldn't. It wasn't always about becoming a fashion plate, it wasn't always about becoming beautiful. That sort of emerged as something extra. And it's very nice to have those accolades, but it shouldn't impinge on you as an actor. </p> <p><strong>Why did you and your sister form a production company? </strong></p> <p>Because it's such a drag sitting around waiting for somebody to tell me I could go to work.

We have a bizarrely good relationship. We have our fights, but they haven't been to do with work. </p> <p><strong>Even when one of your movies hits a snag, like Slow Burn? </strong></p> <p>No. But it is a truly dreadful film! Everything that could go wrong went wrong. Unions shut us down, we ran out of money, we had a director who just wandered off into the desert one day and refused to carry on with it.

Eileen Martin Get on to the internet and do a search for keywords: canada, rental, motorhomes, or, canada rv rental, etc. When you have found something you think might be suitable, start e-mailing. When you think you want to clinch a deal, start phoning. Do not hire through an agent over here because they take a big cut. Martin Ragg This week's question I will be travelling to Uruguay in November, where I'll initially be staying with a friend. I want to use the opportunity to travel around, and plan to spend a week in Buenos Aires. However, while there, I'll probably be touring alone and I don't speak any Spanish. Will I get by with English and a little Italian, or should I take a Spanish course before I go?

Europe's seas are scattered with them, many of them rich not only in beautiful beaches, but in cultural, historical and archaeological legacies from the days when they were thriving nation states in their own right. But diversity is the name of the game, so choose your haven wisely. Step ashore in Capri, say, and it's too late to discover you were really after one-goat-taverna solitude. Menorca, too, would be a major mistake if it's temples that turn you on... </p> <p>The number one isle...<br><strong>Majorca</strong></p> <p>The Val D'en Marche, in the north of the island, is in a wonderful dead-end of countryside - farmhouses with pools under the palms and orange trees; the sound of silence broken by the hum of bees in the bougainvillea and the thwacking of harvesters' sticks on the almond trees. Yet such rural isolation is only a 10-minute drive from the supermarket and baker's at Pollensa; 20 minutes from the beaches at Puerto Pollensa; an hour from the Spanish shops in Palma. And equally distant from the holiday developments on the south coast. </p> <p>Getting there: CV Travel (020-7591 2810) has several farmhouses to rent in the valley. Camp D'Avall sleeping eight costs from \u00a31,020 a week excluding flights and car. Also: Simply Spain (020-8541 2208); Travel Club of Upminster.</p> <p>Beaches <br><strong>Menorca</strong></p> <p> If all you want is a good beach, Menorca's your island. It has about 100 in all, from I-want-to be-alone covettes to enormous open swathes. In the busier south, the sands are white and fine; in the wilder and windier north, they are redder and comparatively coarse. Menorca is perfect for older couples and families with children in the armband stages of waterplay. Self-catering apartments and villas abound in resorts such as Son Bou (one of the finest beaches in the Med), Santo Tomas (purpose-built but low-key, with a sandy beach, dunes and a string of empty coves as neighbours) and Santa Galdana, a peach of a beach set in a deep horseshoe bay. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> The Travel Club of Upminster (01708 225000) features a wide selection of the better hotels and self-catering accommodation. One week self-catering from \u00a3338pp in September. Also: Magic of Spain (020-8748 4220); Meon Travel (01730 268411). </p> <p> Partying<br> <strong>Ibiza</strong></p> <p> Ibiza is at its best by night, where there are three distinct zones: Ibiza Town, the most sophisticated; San Antonio, the most unpleasant; and the road in between the two, the most outrageous. If you're looking for tapas or nightlife, wait until midnight and get down to Teatro Pereira, the old theatre, where there is decent live music and a fine long bar. Move on from here to the marina for a drink at Izay, Keeper or Il Devino, followed perhaps by salsa at Indiana before going on to Pacha, one of a chain of cool Spanish clubs. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> One week self-catering in Figueretas with Skytours (0990 133500) from \u00a3365pp high season, based on four sharing. Also: Magic of Spain (020-8748 4220); Airtours (0870 6081940). </p> <p>Self catering <br> <strong>Corfu</strong></p> <p> Corfu's north-east corner, nicknamed Kensington-on-Sea, is decidedly AB-posh, as well as lovely. All the upmarket self-catering companies have houses here, clinging to the cliffs with plenty of breathing space between neighbours. Corfu days are, essentially, a matter of where to bathe and where to have lunch. The beaches are beautiful, the seas crystal and the island compact - just 40 miles from end to end - so it's easy to explore. Save a day for Corfu Town with its fine Venetian architecture, pretty, narrow streets, cricket matches and caf\u00e9s on the arcaded Liston. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> CV Travel's (0870 6060013) properties along the coast range from a village house in Agios Stephanos (one week based on four in June from \u00a3350pp) to a luxurious villa with pool and English cook (same time from \u00a3685pp). Also Corfu \u00e0 la Carte (01635 863030); Simply Ionian (020-8541 2203). </p> <p> Mountain scenery<br> <strong>Corsica</strong></p> <p> Mountains are likely to play a more central role in a holiday on Corsica than on any other Med island. Between the peaks are forests of beech, cork, pine, oak and chestnut, plus lakes, rivers, deep gorges, waterfalls and medieval villages clinging like limpets to impossible slopes. Such scenery is best seen in the north-west Parc Regional, which surrounds the highest peak, Monte Cinto. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> Tall Stories (01932 252002) bases its adventure sports holidays in Propriano in the south. Choose a three- or five-sport holiday (from \u00a3475/\u00a3535 respectively for one week's half-board, excluding flights). Activities include horseriding, scuba diving, canyoning (abseiling through gorges), trekking, sea-kayaking and sailing. Both Exodus (020-8675 5550) and Explore Worldwide (01252 760000) package walks. Simply Corsica (020-8541 2203) offers self-catering packages. </p> <p> Bathing <br><strong>Iceland</strong></p> <p> Having harnessed the geothermal energy hovering below the island's surface, Iceland is selling itself as the spa capital of Europe. Seven hot pools in and around Reykjavik allow visitors to swim outdoors in pure water heated in the depths of the Earth. These are only surpassed by The Blue Lagoon, lying in an extra-terrestrial landscape of rough lava fields where dippers can luxuriate in seawater inside a cave at a balmy 36C. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> Weekend breaks with Icelandair (020-7874 1000) from \u00a3299, three-night fly-drives from \u00a3369. Others: Arctic Experience (01737 218800); Northern Lights Tours (020-7874 1000). </p> <p> Archaeology <br><strong> Sicily</strong></p> <p> \"To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily,\" wrote Goethe, \"is not to have seen Italy at all, for Sicily is the clue to everything.\" Greeks, Romans, Carthaginians, Normans, Spanish, Austrians, French, Saracens, Italians and even the British have all left a rich cultural legacy. The spectacular line of Doric temples at Agrigento is the most important archeological site on the island, closely followed by a Roman and Greek amphitheatre and the Ear of Dionysius, a grotto used as an ancient prison at Syracuse; a third-century villa at Casale; and the isolated ruins of Selinunte, one of the most important Greek colonies in Sicily. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> 11-day guided Sicilia Antiqua holiday \u00a31,600 with Andante Travels (01980 610555). Also: Citalia (020-8686 5533); Magic of Italy (020-8748 7575). </p> <p> Escape <br><strong> Kornati </strong></p> <p> There are more peaceful islets in the Kornati National Park than there are spots on a Dalmatian. Scattered around the belly of the Croatian coast, these 140 virtually uninhabited anchorages are Celtic in appearance. They make a hot and lazy paradise for yachties, offering nothing to do all day but sunbathe, swim in the Adriatic off pebbly beaches, climb the rocky contours to photograph the views and dine in the odd taverna on fresh sea bass, Dalmatian ham and black-rice risotto. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> one week sailing from Pula from \u00a3510pp based on four sharing a yacht with Sunsail (02392 222222). Croatia specialists: Dolunay (01452-501978); Transun (0870 4444747). </p> <p> Exclusivity <br><strong> Capri</strong></p> <p> Oh, the crowds. The world and his wife want to see Capri, and most of them seem to manage it in peak season. Moving off the ferry, the crowds clamber for the funicular up to La Piazzetta, the hub of the world, in the distinctly pretty town with its chic shops. Capri is a beautiful island of gardens, panoramas, walks and exclusive hotels. The five-star Quisisana is the grand dame, worth a stay if only for the opportunity to eavesdrop on assorted film stars, tycoons and lesser royals. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> three nights' half board from \u00a3695 with Exclusive Italy (01892 619650). Also: Abercrombie &amp; Kent (020-7559 8686); Italian Connection (07071 303030). </p> <p> Windsurfing <br><strong> Lefkas</strong></p> <p> The resort of Vassiliki on Lefkas is partly a charming Greek village with beaches, partly one of the best places in Europe to windsurf. The shops are full of boards, the bay entirely filled with fluttering sails. With an enviable combination of sheltered waters, protection from the deep claw of a headland, light whispering breezes in the morning, and strong, force five to six winds in the afternoon, it is ideal for all abilities. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> One week with Club Vassiliki Holidays (01920 484121) from \u00a3375pp. Also Island Wandering (01580 860733); JMC (0870 6075085). </p> <p> Gay <br><strong> Mykonos</strong></p> <p>The St Tropez of the Aegean is as pretty as a postcard, with snow-white Cycladic architecture, labyrinthine streets and a cosmopolitan capital (Chora). Having visited the ruins of Delos, once the hub of Greek civilisation, life in Mykonos is a round-the-clock sophisticated club and bar scene, featuring some of the wildest, raunchiest and most beautiful people in Greece. Super Paradise is the main gay beach among a string of fine white sands where swimming costumes are generally (and legally) shed.</p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> apartments from \u00a3450 per week (excluding flights) and a huge range of villas with Elysian Holidays (01580 766599). Also: Priceright Holidays (020-8275 5500); Amathus (020-7611 0901). </p> <p> Taking over <br><strong> Eilean Shona</strong></p> <p> Play at being laird on a Scottish island. Eilean Shona, off the west coast in Loch Moidart, can be yours for a week of pampered tranquillity. You have your own, sumptuously-decorated country house (sleeping 10 adults, or 14 with children) complete with open fires, four posters, sumptuous bathrooms, piano, playroom, tennis court, beach walks and boats. Housekeeper Marie produces three organic feasts a day in the kitchen, while husband Ian maintains the garden and motor boats, ferries guests from beach picnics, and builds barbecues in the woods. A handful of self-catering cottages are so well camouflaged that house guests are totally oblivious to them. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> Eilean Shona costs \u00a37,000 for a week; call 01967 431249. Cottages start at \u00a3235 per week from Ecosse Unique (01835 870779). </p> <p> Island hopping <br><strong> Dodecanese</strong> </p> <p> The \"12 islands\" (which actually add up to 16) work perfectly as stepping stones as they lie in a reasonably-straight south-easterly line from Athens, and most of them are served by the main ferry services that operate out of Piraeus, so you can make your way slowly down the islands, from Patmos in the north to Rhodes in the south. With a few exceptions - which are only accessible by excursion boats - most of them can be reached by hopping on and off the boats as easily as a local bus. You can call at Lipsi, Leros, Kalymnos, Kos, Nissyros, Tilos and Symi. If you want to extend the trip, you can continue via Halki to the distant Dodecanese island of Karpathos. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> One week self-catering in, say, Lipsi with Laskarina Holidays (01629 822203) from \u00a3350pp. Also: Direct Greece (020-8785 4000); Manos Holidays (020-7216 8000). </p> <p> Staying cool <br><strong> Lofoten Islands</strong></p> <p> Some like it cool - hence the popularity of the Lofoten Islands, a scattering of islands linked by bridge or tunnel off the Norwegian coast. There's not much call for Factor 15 here, where cod is king, not the sun. They've been hanging their fish out to dry since the days of the Vikings, and won't stop until forced to by increasing departures to the mainland by the younger generation. Most tourists arrive by plane or on the boat from Bod\u00f8 in Norway, relishing the prospect of an uncluttered few days' walking, cycling, tramping the northern beaches, rowing the silent fjords and yes, even sunbathing on the rocks. All this from a self-catering rorbuer (fisherman's cottage) complete with rowing boat for catching breakfast, naturally. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> Seven nights with Inntravel (01653 629010) from \u00a3847pp. Also: Scanmeridian (020-7431 5322); Taber Holidays (01274 594642). </p> <p> Nudity <br><strong> Ile du Levant</strong> </p> <p> Taking all your clothes off is the cool thing to do. But only where it's permitted. Most islands have a beach or two where you can build up an all-over tan unnoticed. But on Ile du Levant, one of three Iles d'Hyeres floating off southern France, it is positively frowned upon to remain a \"textile tourist\". Although 90% of this little island is a military reserve, the remaining tenth has been a nudist colony, based in the village of Heliopolis, since the 1930s. The island is humid, sunny and wild with eucalyptus trees, yucca plants and geraniums. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> There are three reasonable hotels and three campsites; year-round daily ferries cross from Port d'Hyeres (04 94 57 44 07) and Le Lavandou (904 94 71 01 02). Further details: French Government Tourist Office (09068 244123). Calls charged at 60p a minute). </p> <p> Retro <br><strong> Isle of Wight</strong></p> <p> Like donkey rides on the sands and knotted hankies, the Isle of Wight is part of growing up in Britain. In fact, it's a Britain-in-bonsai. There are flowers for sale in buckets at the bottom of cottage paths, cricket on the beach and wooden clinker-built dinghies bobbing in the breeze. Visitors can fill their days with grand houses, castles, steam trains, fabulous sandy beaches, unmatched geological variety, semitropical plants, long walks, cycling paths, sailing waters, trendy hotels, seafood restaurants and huge Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> Wightlink (0870 582 7744) and Red Funnel (01703 333811) are both ferry and tour operators. Five-day excursion fares with Wightlink start at \u00a357 for a car and up to four passengers. Sample packages with car crossing: one week at Seaview Hotel from \u00a3594 (children half price) end of May; self-catering pine lodge sleeping six around \u00a3528. Also: National Trust Holiday Cottages (01225 791199). </p> <p> A bit of posh <br><strong> Sardinia</strong></p> <p> For a taste of la dolce vita , look no further than the Costa Smeralda in north-east Sardinia. The Emerald Coast earned its name from its pale green, transparent waters, which have made it a playground for the mega-rich and a yachtie's paradise. Short enough to drive in a few minutes, the Costa Smeralda was \"discovered\" in the early 60s by a group of property developers led by the Aga Khan, who transformed it into a tastefully-landscaped strip of villas, apartments, hotels and restaurants. Exclusive properties are hidden above beautiful coves, surrounded by spongy lawns. Porto Cervo is the \"capital\", where humble fishing boats have been replaced by Bond-style motor launches, coiffured poodles take their owners on passeggiate and the local grocer's shop is now a branch of Gucci. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> One week B&amp;B in Cervo Hotel from \u00a31,020 with Exclusive Italy (01892 619650). Also: Costa Smeralda Holidays (020-7493 8303); Italian Connection 07071 303030). </p> <p> Families <br><strong> Spetses</strong></p> <p> The ban on private cars in Spetses is a big plus for families - and the horse-drawn carriages that replace them as serious modes of transport are seen as fun rides by children. Visitors anxious to get settled on the beach can also rent mopeds or bikes, or catch one of the caiques that set off each morning from the harbour. Beaches are pretty, pebbly, pine-shaded, and perfectly safe for small children, particularly Anarghyri on the south-west coast. Consider hotels such as the Nissia whose rooms are separate cottages, one- and two-bedroom options each with a kitchen. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> One week at The Nissia hotel, with a pool and accommodation in separate cottages with kitchens, from \u00a3565pp with Hidden Greece (020-7721 8640), flying to Athens with a three-hour onward ferry trip. Others: Filoxenia (01422 375999); CV Travel (0870 606 0013). </p> <p> Walking <br><strong> Crete</strong> </p> <p> To many people, Crete is Aghios Nikolaos, a charming but busy resort on the north-east coast with a string of open-air tavernas and discos. But to those on the hoof, it is the untouched western end, from Hania down to Hora Sfakion in the south. Guided walking holidays can explore the spectacular White Mountains, beautiful coastal paths, lush gorges and citrus groves, turquoise lagoons and rocky coves, Byzantine mansions and fascinating monasteries. The star, of course, being a 12-mile fissure, the Samaria Gorge. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> Eight-day guided \"Marvels of the Med\" walking holiday from \u00a3727pp full board with Headwater (01606 813333). Also: Sunvil (020-8568 4499); Greek Sun Holidays (01732 740317). </p> <p> History <br><strong> Malta</strong></p> <p> Malta's strategic position along the Mediterranean trade routes has subjected it to invading conquerors since the time of the Carthaginians. Its most recent occupants were the British, who maintained it as an important naval base until the island's independence in 1874. The Natural History Museum in Mdina, the ancient capital, is worth a visit for the building alone, an elaborate palace built by the Knights of St John. More recent historic evidence appears in Valletta's Wartime Museum. Malta is hot on beaches, although certain resort hotels - especially around Mellieha Bay - have their own lush gardens and private strands. </p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> One week self-catering with Belleair (020-8785 3266) from \u00a3267 based on five sharing. Also: Cadogan (023 8082 8313); Malta Direct (020-8785 3233).</p>",

They make a hot and lazy paradise for yachties, offering nothing to do all day but sunbathe, swim in the Adriatic off pebbly beaches, climb the rocky contours to photograph the views and dine in the odd taverna on fresh sea bass, Dalmatian ham and black-rice risotto. Getting there: one week sailing from Pula from \u00a3510pp based on four sharing a yacht with Sunsail (02392 222222). Croatia specialists: Dolunay (01452-501978); Transun (0870 4444747). Exclusivity Capri Oh, the crowds. The world and his wife want to see Capri, and most of them seem to manage it in peak season. Moving off the ferry, the crowds clamber for the funicular up to La Piazzetta, the hub of the world, in the distinctly pretty town with its chic shops. Capri is a beautiful island of gardens, panoramas, walks and exclusive hotels. The five-star Quisisana is the grand dame, worth a stay if only for the opportunity to eavesdrop on assorted film stars, tycoons and lesser royals. Getting there: three nights' half board from \u00a3695 with Exclusive Italy (01892 619650). Also: Abercrombie &amp; Kent (020-7559 8686); Italian Connection (07071 303030). Windsurfing Lefkas The resort of Vassiliki on Lefkas is partly a charming Greek village with beaches, partly one of the best places in Europe to windsurf. The shops are full of boards, the bay entirely filled with fluttering sails. With an enviable combination of sheltered waters, protection from the deep claw of a headland, light whispering breezes in the morning, and strong, force five to six winds in the afternoon, it is ideal for all abilities. Getting there: One week with Club Vassiliki Holidays (01920 484121) from \u00a3375pp. Also Island Wandering (01580 860733); JMC (0870 6075085). Gay Mykonos The St Tropez of the Aegean is as pretty as a postcard, with snow-white Cycladic architecture, labyrinthine streets and a cosmopolitan capital (Chora). Having visited the ruins of Delos, once the hub of Greek civilisation, life in Mykonos is a round-the-clock sophisticated club and bar scene, featuring some of the wildest, raunchiest and most beautiful people in Greece. Super Paradise is the main gay beach among a string of fine white sands where swimming costumes are generally (and legally) shed. Getting there: apartments from \u00a3450 per week (excluding flights) and a huge range of villas with Elysian Holidays (01580 766599). Also: Priceright Holidays (020-8275 5500); Amathus (020-7611 0901). Taking over Eilean Shona Play at being laird on a Scottish island. Eilean Shona, off the west coast in Loch Moidart, can be yours for a week of pampered tranquillity. You have your own, sumptuously-decorated country house (sleeping 10 adults, or 14 with children) complete with open fires, four posters, sumptuous bathrooms, piano, playroom, tennis court, beach walks and boats. Housekeeper Marie produces three organic feasts a day in the kitchen, while husband Ian maintains the garden and motor boats, ferries guests from beach picnics, and builds barbecues in the woods. A handful of self-catering cottages are so well camouflaged that house guests are totally oblivious to them. Getting there: Eilean Shona costs \u00a37,000 for a week; call 01967 431249. Cottages start at \u00a3235 per week from Ecosse Unique (01835 870779). Island hopping Dodecanese The \"12 islands\" (which actually add up to 16) work perfectly as stepping stones as they lie in a reasonably-straight south-easterly line from Athens, and most of them are served by the main ferry services that operate out of Piraeus, so you can make your way slowly down the islands, from Patmos in the north to Rhodes in the south. With a few exceptions - which are only accessible by excursion boats - most of them can be reached by hopping on and off the boats as easily as a local bus. You can call at Lipsi, Leros, Kalymnos, Kos, Nissyros, Tilos and Symi. If you want to extend the trip, you can continue via Halki to the distant Dodecanese island of Karpathos. Getting there: One week self-catering in, say, Lipsi with Laskarina Holidays (01629 822203) from \u00a3350pp. Also: Direct Greece (020-8785 4000); Manos Holidays (020-7216 8000). Staying cool Lofoten Islands Some like it cool - hence the popularity of the Lofoten Islands, a scattering of islands linked by bridge or tunnel off the Norwegian coast. There's not much call for Factor 15 here, where cod is king, not the sun. They've been hanging their fish out to dry since the days of the Vikings, and won't stop until forced to by increasing departures to the mainland by the younger generation. Most tourists arrive by plane or on the boat from Bod\u00f8 in Norway, relishing the prospect of an uncluttered few days' walking, cycling, tramping the northern beaches, rowing the silent fjords and yes, even sunbathing on the rocks. All this from a self-catering rorbuer (fisherman's cottage) complete with rowing boat for catching breakfast, naturally. Getting there: Seven nights with Inntravel (01653 629010) from \u00a3847pp. Also: Scanmeridian (020-7431 5322); Taber Holidays (01274 594642). Nudity Ile du Levant Taking all your clothes off is the cool thing to do. But only where it's permitted. Most islands have a beach or two where you can build up an all-over tan unnoticed. But on Ile du Levant, one of three Iles d'Hyeres floating off southern France, it is positively frowned upon to remain a \"textile tourist\". Although 90% of this little island is a military reserve, the remaining tenth has been a nudist colony, based in the village of Heliopolis, since the 1930s. The island is humid, sunny and wild with eucalyptus trees, yucca plants and geraniums. Getting there: There are three reasonable hotels and three campsites; year-round daily ferries cross from Port d'Hyeres (04 94 57 44 07) and Le Lavandou (904 94 71 01 02). Further details: French Government Tourist Office (09068 244123). Calls charged at 60p a minute). Retro Isle of Wight Like donkey rides on the sands and knotted hankies, the Isle of Wight is part of growing up in Britain. In fact, it's a Britain-in-bonsai. There are flowers for sale in buckets at the bottom of cottage paths, cricket on the beach and wooden clinker-built dinghies bobbing in the breeze. Visitors can fill their days with grand houses, castles, steam trains, fabulous sandy beaches, unmatched geological variety, semitropical plants, long walks, cycling paths, sailing waters, trendy hotels, seafood restaurants and huge Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Getting there: Wightlink (0870 582 7744) and Red Funnel (01703 333811) are both ferry and tour operators. Five-day excursion fares with Wightlink start at \u00a357 for a car and up to four passengers. Sample packages with car crossing: one week at Seaview Hotel from \u00a3594 (children half price) end of May; self-catering pine lodge sleeping six around \u00a3528. Also: National Trust Holiday Cottages (01225 791199). A bit of posh Sardinia For a taste of la dolce vita , look no further than the Costa Smeralda in north-east Sardinia. The Emerald Coast earned its name from its pale green, transparent waters, which have made it a playground for the mega-rich and a yachtie's paradise. Short enough to drive in a few minutes, the Costa Smeralda was \"discovered\" in the early 60s by a group of property developers led by the Aga Khan, who transformed it into a tastefully-landscaped strip of villas, apartments, hotels and restaurants. Exclusive properties are hidden above beautiful coves, surrounded by spongy lawns. Porto Cervo is the \"capital\", where humble fishing boats have been replaced by Bond-style motor launches, coiffured poodles take their owners on passeggiate and the local grocer's shop is now a branch of Gucci. Getting there: One week B&amp;B in Cervo Hotel from \u00a31,020 with Exclusive Italy (01892 619650). Also: Costa Smeralda Holidays (020-7493 8303); Italian Connection 07071 303030). Families Spetses The ban on private cars in Spetses is a big plus for families - and the horse-drawn carriages that replace them as serious modes of transport are seen as fun rides by children. Visitors anxious to get settled on the beach can also rent mopeds or bikes, or catch one of the caiques that set off each morning from the harbour. Beaches are pretty, pebbly, pine-shaded, and perfectly safe for small children, particularly Anarghyri on the south-west coast. Consider hotels such as the Nissia whose rooms are separate cottages, one- and two-bedroom options each with a kitchen. Getting there: One week at The Nissia hotel, with a pool and accommodation in separate cottages with kitchens, from \u00a3565pp with Hidden Greece (020-7721 8640), flying to Athens with a three-hour onward ferry trip. Others: Filoxenia (01422 375999); CV Travel (0870 606 0013). Walking Crete To many people, Crete is Aghios Nikolaos, a charming but busy resort on the north-east coast with a string of open-air tavernas and discos. But to those on the hoof, it is the untouched western end, from Hania down to Hora Sfakion in the south. Guided walking holidays can explore the spectacular White Mountains, beautiful coastal paths, lush gorges and citrus groves, turquoise lagoons and rocky coves, Byzantine mansions and fascinating monasteries. The star, of course, being a 12-mile fissure, the Samaria Gorge. Getting there: Eight-day guided \"Marvels of the Med\" walking holiday from \u00a3727pp full board with Headwater (01606 813333). Also: Sunvil (020-8568 4499); Greek Sun Holidays (01732 740317). History Malta Malta's strategic position along the Mediterranean trade routes has subjected it to invading conquerors since the time of the Carthaginians. Its most recent occupants were the British, who maintained it as an important naval base until the island's independence in 1874. The Natural History Museum in Mdina, the ancient capital, is worth a visit for the building alone, an elaborate palace built by the Knights of St John. More recent historic evidence appears in Valletta's Wartime Museum. Malta is hot on beaches, although certain resort hotels - especially around Mellieha Bay - have their own lush gardens and private strands. Getting there: One week self-catering with Belleair (020-8785 3266) from \u00a3267 based on five sharing. Also: Cadogan (023 8082 8313); Malta Direct (020-8785 3233).",

      "body": "<p>So you've arrived for Euro 2000. What do you do on your days off, when England aren't playing and you can't face the trek out to Liege to watch Denmark play the Czech Republic? </p> <p>The Low Countries, as we always used to call them, or Benelux in even more drab Euro-speak, don't exactly have an exotic reputation. There's a temptation to view them like East Anglia with a funny accent. But that would be a mistake. Their pleasures may be slow burning (especially in Amsterdam's coffee shops) but these countries, have more capital H heritage than you might imagine. </p> <p><strong> Getting around</strong></p> <p> Why brave Belgian driving - among the worst in Europe - when the trains are so convenient? If based in Brussels, you will be able to get to most games by rail, in clean, fast trains without hassle. Almost all the trains stop at each of the three main stations in Brussels: Gare du Nord, Gare Central and Gare du Midi. Tickets are reasonable (buy at the station; they are more expensive on board). </p> <p>Charleroi, where England meet Germany on June 17, is 45 minutes away, Bruges is an hour, Rotterdam less than a couple of hours and Amsterdam half an hour beyond that. </p> <p><strong> Accommodation</strong></p> <p> This is expensive: you won't get anywhere remotely nice in either capital for less than about \u00a350 a night. Arriving on Eurostar at Brussels' Gare du Midi, you will be landing in one of the more gruesome parts of town. Grab a cab to somewhere more salubrious - the centre is not far away. All the stations are prime sites for pick-pockets, and the Gare du Nord is in the red-light district. </p> <p>If you're flush, the Metropole is a good central hotel, in Place de Brouckere. If not, you could base yourself in an apartment hotel - like self- catering bedsits. Try the City Garden in Rue Joseph II or Orion, near the fish market in Quai au Bois \u00e0 Bruler. </p> <p>Many small hotels in the Netherlands are part of chains such as Golden Tulip or SAS and, because they serve a business clientele, are quite expensive and booked up during the week. If you're on the road, the motorway service areas are much more frequent than in Britain and usually have cheap hotels attached. </p> <p><strong> Drinking</strong></p> <p> You could start a day's sightseeing campaign over a Belgian beer. If the authorities haven't closed all the bars in anticipation of trouble (and this would take a major domestic crisis), you should be able to find a drink any time from about 8am, even if it is only a coffee. But it would be a crime not to sample the beer while you're here. Belgians take their beer quite as seriously as the French take their wine, but are rather less poncy about it, apart from a weird proclivity for funny beer glasses. Every brew has its own shape: Kwak comes in a specimen-shaped glass secured in a wooden cradle. </p> <p>Belgium has twice as many bars per head of population as England has pubs and, at a recent count, more than 90 breweries producing at least 400 beers ranging from Stella Artois at Leuven's giant Interbrew factory to country bars where the owner brews his own round the back. </p> <p>Don't stick with Stella or the other mass lagers, Jupiler or Maes - the fruit beers such as Framboise (made from raspberries) or Kriek (cherries) are wonderful, as are the geuzes , brewed around Brussels. The white beers ( wit bier in Flanders, blanche in Wallonia) are very refreshing on a summer's day. Just remember that Belgian beers are more potent than British ones. </p> <p><strong> Eating</strong></p> <p> Belgium has some of the best restaurants in the world. They don't believe in nouvelle cuisine and see it as their mission in life to fill you up. You must try the frites with mayonnaise, because they are better than any chips you have ever tasted before. And don't forget the moules . </p> <p>Even the fast food is better here: the Quick hamburger chain is a cut above McDonald's. In fact, it's very hard to eat badly, even in the cheapest bar in any central square, and you'll get a good steak 'n' frites for under a tenner. </p> <p>In Brussels, there are hundreds of restaurants around the Grand Place, especially in Rue des Bouchers, and outdoor fish restaurants a few hundred yards away in Place St Catherine. You could splurge out at one of the world's great restaurants, such as the Villa Lorraine, Chauss\u00e9e de la Hulpe or Comme Chez Soi, Place Rouppe, for around \u00a3250 for two, if you can get in. Or you could try somewhere more earthi1y Bruxellois such as Chez Vincent in the Rue des Bouchers. A personal favourite is In 't Spinnekopke (about \u00a340 for two). </p> <p><strong> What to see</strong></p> <p> Nip over to Ghent, 30 miles west of Brussels, half-an-hour on the train, and see Van Eyck's Mystic Lamb in St Baaf's cathedral (closed like many public buildings for lengthy lunch breaks, so don't arrive between noon and 2pm). </p> <p>In Brussels, see the Brueghels in the Mus\u00e9es Royaux des Beaux-Arts - next door is the modern gallery with the great Belgian surrealists such as Magritte and Delvaux - here, they coordinate opening hours so that when one is closed for lunch, the other is open. Then there's the strip-cartoon gallery in Rue des Sables, (this is the home of Tintin after all), and even an underpants museum. </p> <p>Or you could wander into the municipal art gallery in Charleroi's central Place du Man\u00e8ge, also called the Palais des Beaux Arts, to see more works by Magritte. </p> <p>Sixty miles west of Brussels, Bruges is famously pretty, twee and medieval. </p> <p>In Amsterdam, the Rembrandts, Vermeers and Hals in the Rijksmuseum in Stadhouderskadse are unmissable. As is the Anne Frank House in Prinsengracht. Then again, there's always the tattoo museum. </p> <p><strong> Historic sites</strong></p> <p> If it's battlefields you want, Waterloo is 12 miles south of Brussels; the Ardennes forest - where Hitler's frozen army staged its last assault in a blizzard at Christmas in 1944 - is 100 miles east; Arnhem - where Monty's men tried to take a bridge too far earlier that autumn - is in eastern Holland, north of Eindhoven, where England play their opening game against Portugal on June 12; or, there's first-world-war sites stretching from Mons to Passchendaele and Ypres. </p> <p>Waterloo is a bit tacky. But I defy anyone not to be moved at Ypres - 70 miles west of Brussels - where 430,000 Britons lie in cemeteries. The local fire brigade sounds the Last Post under the Menin Gate every night. </p> <p>Go also to St Symphorien cemetery near Mons, 20 miles west of Charleroi, where Private J Parr, the first British casualty of the war lies a few yards from Private J L Price, killed just as the armistice was sounding. </p> <p>Stand in this quiet spot, in the fields of southern Belgium and remember, whatever the tabloid hype this summer, that what you're there to see is only a game.</p>",

If not, you could base yourself in an apartment hotel - like self- catering bedsits. Try the City Garden in Rue Joseph II or Orion, near the fish market in Quai au Bois \u00e0 Bruler. Many small hotels in the Netherlands are part of chains such as Golden Tulip or SAS and, because they serve a business clientele, are quite expensive and booked up during the week. If you're on the road, the motorway service areas are much more frequent than in Britain and usually have cheap hotels attached. Drinking You could start a day's sightseeing campaign over a Belgian beer. If the authorities haven't closed all the bars in anticipation of trouble (and this would take a major domestic crisis), you should be able to find a drink any time from about 8am, even if it is only a coffee. But it would be a crime not to sample the beer while you're here. Belgians take their beer quite as seriously as the French take their wine, but are rather less poncy about it, apart from a weird proclivity for funny beer glasses. Every brew has its own shape: Kwak comes in a specimen-shaped glass secured in a wooden cradle. Belgium has twice as many bars per head of population as England has pubs and, at a recent count, more than 90 breweries producing at least 400 beers ranging from Stella Artois at Leuven's giant Interbrew factory to country bars where the owner brews his own round the back. Don't stick with Stella or the other mass lagers, Jupiler or Maes - the fruit beers such as Framboise (made from raspberries) or Kriek (cherries) are wonderful, as are the geuzes , brewed around Brussels. The white beers ( wit bier in Flanders, blanche in Wallonia) are very refreshing on a summer's day. Just remember that Belgian beers are more potent than British ones. Eating Belgium has some of the best restaurants in the world. They don't believe in nouvelle cuisine and see it as their mission in life to fill you up. You must try the frites with mayonnaise, because they are better than any chips you have ever tasted before. And don't forget the moules . Even the fast food is better here: the Quick hamburger chain is a cut above McDonald's. In fact, it's very hard to eat badly, even in the cheapest bar in any central square, and you'll get a good steak 'n' frites for under a tenner. In Brussels, there are hundreds of restaurants around the Grand Place, especially in Rue des Bouchers, and outdoor fish restaurants a few hundred yards away in Place St Catherine. You could splurge out at one of the world's great restaurants, such as the Villa Lorraine, Chauss\u00e9e de la Hulpe or Comme Chez Soi, Place Rouppe, for around \u00a3250 for two, if you can get in. Or you could try somewhere more earthi1y Bruxellois such as Chez Vincent in the Rue des Bouchers. A personal favourite is In 't Spinnekopke (about \u00a340 for two). What to see Nip over to Ghent, 30 miles west of Brussels, half-an-hour on the train, and see Van Eyck's Mystic Lamb in St Baaf's cathedral (closed like many public buildings for lengthy lunch breaks, so don't arrive between noon and 2pm). In Brussels, see the Brueghels in the Mus\u00e9es Royaux des Beaux-Arts - next door is the modern gallery with the great Belgian surrealists such as Magritte and Delvaux - here, they coordinate opening hours so that when one is closed for lunch, the other is open. Then there's the strip-cartoon gallery in Rue des Sables, (this is the home of Tintin after all), and even an underpants museum. Or you could wander into the municipal art gallery in Charleroi's central Place du Man\u00e8ge, also called the Palais des Beaux Arts, to see more works by Magritte. Sixty miles west of Brussels, Bruges is famously pretty, twee and medieval. In Amsterdam, the Rembrandts, Vermeers and Hals in the Rijksmuseum in Stadhouderskadse are unmissable. As is the Anne Frank House in Prinsengracht. Then again, there's always the tattoo museum. Historic sites If it's battlefields you want, Waterloo is 12 miles south of Brussels; the Ardennes forest - where Hitler's frozen army staged its last assault in a blizzard at Christmas in 1944 - is 100 miles east; Arnhem - where Monty's men tried to take a bridge too far earlier that autumn - is in eastern Holland, north of Eindhoven, where England play their opening game against Portugal on June 12; or, there's first-world-war sites stretching from Mons to Passchendaele and Ypres. Waterloo is a bit tacky. But I defy anyone not to be moved at Ypres - 70 miles west of Brussels - where 430,000 Britons lie in cemeteries. The local fire brigade sounds the Last Post under the Menin Gate every night. Go also to St Symphorien cemetery near Mons, 20 miles west of Charleroi, where Private J Parr, the first British casualty of the war lies a few yards from Private J L Price, killed just as the armistice was sounding. Stand in this quiet spot, in the fields of southern Belgium and remember, whatever the tabloid hype this summer, that what you're there to see is only a game.",

And by the time Atherton's vigil ended with a drive to cover off Mbangwa (303 for 7), it was Schofield who was scoring most of the runs, particularly square of the wicket on the off side. </p> <p>England could have declared at their tea-time score of 327 for 7, but chose to bat on.

      "body": "<p>A North American tourist wears a T-shirt announcing \"I survived the road to Monteverde.\" Doubtless, one day, the road from San Jose to Monteverde will turn into a super-highway with garages, phones, road markings and signposts. But some locals would rather the road stayed the way it is. </p> <p>Hoteliers are not keen on the idea of improvement as it would mean people doing one-day visits instead of staying several. Others say that Monteverde is too small to accommodate many tourists without risking exploitation and damage. However, time, even here, doesn't quite stand still, and in three years a new road has been promised by the government. </p> <p>For the time being, it takes five long hours from San Jose, the last two travelling at an average of 20kmph along a winding, potholed track, sweating, breathing dust, bumped from one side of our four-wheel-drive hire car to the other, eyes stinging, throats dry, praying not to get a puncture. </p> <p>\"You see that flat part at the top of the mountain covered in cloud?\" Edgardo points out a place that looks a very long way up and a very long way away. \"That's where we're going.\" </p> <p>You could tell we'd arrived when it wasn't hot anymore, but cloudy and damp, and instead of the odd shack at the side of the road, there were signs to small hotels. At Santa Elena, we get out of the car and notice the roar of the wind through the tree tops - a sound that would intensify at night, accompanied by the shrill screeches of birds. At Cerro Piano, we call in at the supermarket to buy the rudiments of dinner and breakfast for our self-catering bungalow: 400 grams of eggs, a watermelon, a green tomato, a couple of onions and some beer. </p> <p><strong> Accommodation</strong><br> </p> <p> The wood chalet we've booked at Caba\u00f1as Los Pinos is dark and gloomy inside, but relatively insect free - the shower works, there's a coffee-maker, a huge empty fridge and a camping gas stove. We make an omelette, drink the beer and collapse into bed. We've made it, but however tired we are, that first night none of us sleep. In the early hours, Sara wakes with a start, \"What's that noise?\" </p> <p>\"Which noise?\" I ask. The caba\u00f1a seems to toss on the sea at night. The wind roars through the trees. It sounds like the corrugated-iron roof is being lashed sporadically by handfuls of pebbles or grit. The roars and bangs of the wind are punctuated by bird calls. </p> <p>The morning light comes suddenly at 7am, like a child waking - it's night one minute and day the next. </p> <p>The first morning, and the weather puzzled us. Looking out of the window, it could have been the Yorkshire Moors - cloudy and drizzly. But by mid-breakfast, the sun shone and the sky was clear blue. It's confusing - the wind still roaring, a fine mist, cool yet warm. A cacophony of birdsong, and still the wind through the pines. </p> <p><strong> The cloud forest</strong><br> </p> <p> On our first walk through the cloud forest, we saw no animals - just enormous trees, dangling creepers, centipedes, huge termite nests. So wet you weren't sure if it was raining or not - but it wasn't. The drip, drip, drip everywhere of water on leaves and the odd whistle of a black-faced solitaire high in the canopy. </p> <p>Yes, it was extraordinary, but not at all like the TV wildlife films - we saw no tree frogs or snakes or monkeys, and, disappointingly, had no sense of danger. It wasn't until the last day, from the bridges of the vertiginous \"sky walk\", that we spied a colony of howler monkeys lounging in the branches of nearby trees, keel-billed toucans flashing across the gaps in the branches, brightly coloured and banana-shaped in flight, and quetzals. </p> <p>On our return flight, we met an elderly gentleman from Whitehall who had braved the \"Sky Trek\": more high bridges suspended in the tree tops, the platforms linked by zipwires: a \"jumping, flying, gliding experience showing what it's like to be an inhabitant of the canopy\". </p> <p>In the, admittedly netted, Butterfly Gardens, we saw the cappuccino butterfly, the \"transparent\" butterfly and the electric blue morpho. At the Hummingbird Centre, hummingbirds whizzed past our ears with a whirring of wings, to hover over red plastic nectar-filled dishes before taking a drink. Sleepy snakes in the Serpentarium were curled up in recycled public telephone boxes, complete with graffiti. </p> <p><strong> The people</strong><br> </p> <p> Personally, I was more fascinated by the human environment. \"People can live anywhere,\" Edgardo says. It is so isolated. Although there is electricity and hot water, schools, medical facilities, the shacks at the side of the road seem basic: two rooms, thin wooden walls, corrugated-iron roofs. Dust clouds from the road mixed with black smoke from the exhausts of buses and trucks. Revving of quadbikes and motorbikes, which intermingle with the horses. Four-wheel-drives rocking up and down the stony, potholed and pitted road. </p> <p>And what's it like in the rainy season, April to November, when the tourists aren't here? Torrential rivers with narrow flimsy wood bridges. Rockfalls. Deep brown sludgy streams of mud. Driving along in the pitch black of night - certainly no street lights, or road markings. </p> <p>Tourists might not be here at all if it hadn't been for a group of North American Quakers in the 50s who wended their way up the oxcart trail and bought land for homes and farms, and also the cloud forest which they sensibly left untouched. </p> <p><strong> Conservation</strong><br> </p> <p> Too much of Costa Rica is now deforested land - farming and logging have laid the mountains bare. The Monteverde Conservation League (MCL) aims to restore and then conserve deforested areas through educating and working with the forest's neighbours, and buying up surrounding land. The ultimate dream of the conservationists is to create a \"corridor\" of cloud forest through Central America, without which larger animals are at risk of extinction and biodiversity is under threat. </p> <p>The Bosque Eternel de los Ni\u00f1os, or Children's Rainforest, works with the MCL to educate children and their families, both locally and around the world, about the cloud forest so that they understand and are involved in the effort to sustain and extend it. </p> <p><strong> The beaches</strong><br> </p> <p> Coming down from Monteverde after five days felt like coming back to earth from another planet. After another long, hot drive and a ferry, we eventually found Montezuma on the Peninsula de Nicoya, at the end of another long stony track. Costa Rica has become the extended backyard of the US, and tents are erected with hammocks under every available palm tree. Idyllic in a palm-fringed, beachy kind of way, and terribly hot. </p> <p>One evening, a downpour of mangoes from the trees heralds the presence of white-faced monkeys, driven from the sparse inland hills to the wooded coastal areas. Indeed, it is at the coast that we see at close hand iguanas, enormous crickets, urraca birds, squirrels and a parrot. </p> <p>At night, the waves roar instead of the wind, but it sounds very similar. </p> <p>Settling back into English life, I'm struck by the comparative silence - no howling wind, no crashing waves. I laugh to see the council resurfacing relatively even roads, and I think myself lucky to have a fox in my back garden. I imagine the elderly gentleman sauntering round Whitehall, and decide that if we ever do go back, I'll definitely have a go on the zipwires...</p>",

However, time, even here, doesn't quite stand still, and in three years a new road has been promised by the government. For the time being, it takes five long hours from San Jose, the last two travelling at an average of 20kmph along a winding, potholed track, sweating, breathing dust, bumped from one side of our four-wheel-drive hire car to the other, eyes stinging, throats dry, praying not to get a puncture. \"You see that flat part at the top of the mountain covered in cloud?\" Edgardo points out a place that looks a very long way up and a very long way away. \"That's where we're going.\" You could tell we'd arrived when it wasn't hot anymore, but cloudy and damp, and instead of the odd shack at the side of the road, there were signs to small hotels. At Santa Elena, we get out of the car and notice the roar of the wind through the tree tops - a sound that would intensify at night, accompanied by the shrill screeches of birds. At Cerro Piano, we call in at the supermarket to buy the rudiments of dinner and breakfast for our self-catering bungalow: 400 grams of eggs, a watermelon, a green tomato, a couple of onions and some beer. Accommodation The wood chalet we've booked at Caba\u00f1as Los Pinos is dark and gloomy inside, but relatively insect free - the shower works, there's a coffee-maker, a huge empty fridge and a camping gas stove. We make an omelette, drink the beer and collapse into bed. We've made it, but however tired we are, that first night none of us sleep. In the early hours, Sara wakes with a start, \"What's that noise?\" \"Which noise?\" I ask. The caba\u00f1a seems to toss on the sea at night. The wind roars through the trees. It sounds like the corrugated-iron roof is being lashed sporadically by handfuls of pebbles or grit. The roars and bangs of the wind are punctuated by bird calls. The morning light comes suddenly at 7am, like a child waking - it's night one minute and day the next. The first morning, and the weather puzzled us. Looking out of the window, it could have been the Yorkshire Moors - cloudy and drizzly. But by mid-breakfast, the sun shone and the sky was clear blue. It's confusing - the wind still roaring, a fine mist, cool yet warm. A cacophony of birdsong, and still the wind through the pines. The cloud forest On our first walk through the cloud forest, we saw no animals - just enormous trees, dangling creepers, centipedes, huge termite nests. So wet you weren't sure if it was raining or not - but it wasn't. The drip, drip, drip everywhere of water on leaves and the odd whistle of a black-faced solitaire high in the canopy. Yes, it was extraordinary, but not at all like the TV wildlife films - we saw no tree frogs or snakes or monkeys, and, disappointingly, had no sense of danger. It wasn't until the last day, from the bridges of the vertiginous \"sky walk\", that we spied a colony of howler monkeys lounging in the branches of nearby trees, keel-billed toucans flashing across the gaps in the branches, brightly coloured and banana-shaped in flight, and quetzals. On our return flight, we met an elderly gentleman from Whitehall who had braved the \"Sky Trek\": more high bridges suspended in the tree tops, the platforms linked by zipwires: a \"jumping, flying, gliding experience showing what it's like to be an inhabitant of the canopy\". In the, admittedly netted, Butterfly Gardens, we saw the cappuccino butterfly, the \"transparent\" butterfly and the electric blue morpho. At the Hummingbird Centre, hummingbirds whizzed past our ears with a whirring of wings, to hover over red plastic nectar-filled dishes before taking a drink. Sleepy snakes in the Serpentarium were curled up in recycled public telephone boxes, complete with graffiti. The people Personally, I was more fascinated by the human environment. \"People can live anywhere,\" Edgardo says. It is so isolated. Although there is electricity and hot water, schools, medical facilities, the shacks at the side of the road seem basic: two rooms, thin wooden walls, corrugated-iron roofs. Dust clouds from the road mixed with black smoke from the exhausts of buses and trucks. Revving of quadbikes and motorbikes, which intermingle with the horses. Four-wheel-drives rocking up and down the stony, potholed and pitted road. And what's it like in the rainy season, April to November, when the tourists aren't here? Torrential rivers with narrow flimsy wood bridges. Rockfalls. Deep brown sludgy streams of mud. Driving along in the pitch black of night - certainly no street lights, or road markings. Tourists might not be here at all if it hadn't been for a group of North American Quakers in the 50s who wended their way up the oxcart trail and bought land for homes and farms, and also the cloud forest which they sensibly left untouched. Conservation Too much of Costa Rica is now deforested land - farming and logging have laid the mountains bare. The Monteverde Conservation League (MCL) aims to restore and then conserve deforested areas through educating and working with the forest's neighbours, and buying up surrounding land. The ultimate dream of the conservationists is to create a \"corridor\" of cloud forest through Central America, without which larger animals are at risk of extinction and biodiversity is under threat. The Bosque Eternel de los Ni\u00f1os, or Children's Rainforest, works with the MCL to educate children and their families, both locally and around the world, about the cloud forest so that they understand and are involved in the effort to sustain and extend it. The beaches Coming down from Monteverde after five days felt like coming back to earth from another planet. After another long, hot drive and a ferry, we eventually found Montezuma on the Peninsula de Nicoya, at the end of another long stony track. Costa Rica has become the extended backyard of the US, and tents are erected with hammocks under every available palm tree. Idyllic in a palm-fringed, beachy kind of way, and terribly hot. One evening, a downpour of mangoes from the trees heralds the presence of white-faced monkeys, driven from the sparse inland hills to the wooded coastal areas. Indeed, it is at the coast that we see at close hand iguanas, enormous crickets, urraca birds, squirrels and a parrot. At night, the waves roar instead of the wind, but it sounds very similar. Settling back into English life, I'm struck by the comparative silence - no howling wind, no crashing waves. I laugh to see the council resurfacing relatively even roads, and I think myself lucky to have a fox in my back garden. I imagine the elderly gentleman sauntering round Whitehall, and decide that if we ever do go back, I'll definitely have a go on the zipwires...",

Billed as the \"the world's first interactive movie\", it's presented in twice-weekly, five-minute episodes. Although Simon Beaufoy, the writer of The Full Monty, has drawn up the characters - the lead is \"pretty, feisty bike courier KJ\" - viewers decide how the story line progresses, through on-line voting and chatroom suggestions.

Basically it's a game, but the signs are that people like playing director. The site (<a href=\"http:// www.itsyourmovie.com\">www.itsyourmovie.com</a>) had half a million hits in the first few days, which is not really surprising: Running Time gives the public exactly what it wants, by dumbing down and appealing to the lowest common denominator.</p> <p>The bottom line is that Running Time is a clever marketing gimmick that will soon be financed using product placements.

From the moment the audience fled in terror during the showing of Louis Lumiere's 1896 film The Arrival Of A Train At A Station, it was obvious that audience feedback was going to be helpful. In the 70s Steven Spielberg and George Lucas found the perfect mass-appeal movie formula, and Lucas declared: \"The studio system is over... the power is with the people now.\"</p> <p>Lucas was confirming a trend that pollster George Gallup had spotted when conducting the first audience surveys 30 years earlier - namely that the majority of cinema-goers were male, teenage and in low-income groups, so appealing to the masses meant making lowbrow star vehicles. Suddenly movie-making was about commerce rather than art. Now, if the audience wants more Rupert Everett in My Best Friend's Wedding, they get it. Likewise, they picked the ending of Fatal Attraction from two alternatives.</p> <p>Naturally, Hollywood's creatives hate screenings. George Lucas voiced every director's pet peeve: \"Previews always mean recutting.\" Spielberg was so nervous before his Jaws test screening he took Valium to get through it. Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid director George Roy Hill took more evasive action; sneaking into one of his own test screenings and forging dozens of preview questionnaires. He has since refused to let his films be test-screened, in case anyone else pulls the same stunt.</p> <p>Word of mouth from screenings can seriously damage a film.

George Lucas's preview for American Graffiti should have been a dream screening: the audience were on their feet cheering and clapping, but the studio executives present declared the film unreleasable, thinking the response was so extreme the cinema must be full of the director's friends. Lucas's mentor, director Francis Ford Coppola, got out his cheque book and offered to buy the film from Universal. The studio wisely refused; American Graffiti went on to become one of the most profitable films of all time.</p> <p>Sometimes, though, the makers get it wrong despite the feedback. Following a successful showing of Star!, producer Richard Zanuck sent a telegraph to his father Daryl: \"We're home. Better than Sound Of Music.\" Sound Of Music became the most popular movie in history, but Star! sank without trace.</p> <p>During the preview for Rolling Thunder, the audience was so disappointed with the ending that they leapt to their feet and tried to assault the studio personnel present. Screenwriter William Goldman recalls a similar reaction to a death scene in the Robert Redford stunt pilot movie Waldo Pepper: \"The audience were furious. They felt tricked, they felt betrayed, and they hated us... They just sat, sullen. For the first hour of the movie, they were in love with us, and in that instant when the girl went off the wing, the affair ended.\"</p> <p>Not surprising, then, that Warners were too afraid of audience reaction to preview The Exorcist. When it was finally released, audiences collapsed, vomited and broke into hysterics. However, it was also a smash hit. Steven Spielberg discovered during the 1975 preview for Jaws that a little projectile vomiting goes a long way.

You might be able to get a cheaper deal closer to departure, but assuming you will want to be sure of getting there, Ryanair will sell you a return ticket for the appropriate dates for \u00a359.30, including taxes.

All the TUI examples involve flying from Frankfurt. Most of the saving would be eaten up by the cost of getting there.

You must be sure of comparing like with like. The number of hotels shared by British and overseas operators is relatively limited. Assuming you can find the property of your choice in a German or Irish brochure, say, you also need to ascertain that flights depart and arrive at equally convenient times, that you will get the same kind of room with the same view, and that the price covers identical arrangements for both meals and drinks. </p> <p>For example: JMC's brochure shows an adult price of \u00a31,425 for a week at the Coco Palm Resort on Baa Atoll in the Maldives. TUI's website quotes prices from DM2,984, again from Frankfurt, which works out at around at \u00a3950 at the current exchange rate and looks like an enormous gap. But wait. The UK price is for an all-inclusive deal. The TUI price is for bed and breakfast, though the German company does offer half-board at about \u00a31,000. </p> <p> A nd none of these comparisons takes into account special offers. The main reason German prices look lower is that the law in Germany deters operators from the kind of deep discounting that takes place in the UK. TUI says it is not absolutely clear whether price cutting is illegal but that while operators remain in doubt, they tend to bypass the problem by re-packaging their holidays. What looks like a discount, in other words, may be a package with different ingredients. </p> <p>In Britain, discounting is a way of life. Book a summer holiday in January, for example, when operators and high-street travel agents traditionally jockey furiously for business, and you could easily get 20% off the brochure price. </p> <p>Another reason for the price gap is that German firms do not normally offer \"free\" child places.

      "body": "<p>The environmental pressures of too many tourists have taken a heavy toll on paradise. As the industry becomes increasingly controlled by big companies, local people have seen their cultures commercialised - and their cut of the profits diminished. </p> <p>So, is it still possible to have a good holiday and remain guilt-free? The answer is yes - especially for the independent traveller or people dealing with smaller tour operators that have link-ups with local communities. </p> <p>Here are five places around the world where you can have a guilt-free holiday. </p> <p><strong> Thailand</strong><br> Ko Yao Noi</p> <p> It can be difficult to find the tranquillity that Thailand was once famous for. But Ko Yao Noi (Little Long Island) has kept out the nightly raves and neon sex bars. </p> <p>The islanders have a healthy attitude to tourism, realising that it is useful to supplement their declining fishing incomes, without wanting to abandon their traditional means of livelihood. </p> <p>Like many fishing communities in Asia, they are suffering the effects of illegal fishing by large commercial boats. Tourism is a way of raising funds for a motor patrol vessel and providing them with an alternative income if fishing stocks get too low. </p> <p>Accommodation is in family homes, and visitors can immerse themselves in everyday life on an uncommercialised Thai island. </p> <p>\u0095 TVS-Rest (00 66 2 691 0437, fax: 00 66 2 690 2796, <a href=\"http://www.welcome.to/tvs\">www.welcome.to/tvs</a> organises three-day trips to Ko Yao Noi for \u00a365, including boat trip from Phuket, accommodation in local homes (basic), food with the family and boat trips, and an English-speaking guide. </p> <p> <strong> Cyprus</strong><br> Akamas</p> <p> Much of Cyprus has been overdeveloped, but the Akamas peninsula is a protected wilderness, perfect for a quiet, out-of-the-way holiday. </p> <p>Conservation measures are aimed at ensuring that the picturesque villages of the Laona region are being developed to cater for visitors without losing their character. </p> <p>The Laona project and the Cyprus Tourism Organisation have encouraged small-scale, rural tourism that can exist side-by-side with traditional farming. Derelict stone houses are being converted into small-scale craft centres, guest houses and tavernas. </p> <p>The young people, who left in search of a better life in the tourist resorts, are beginning to return. The pace of life is still easy and, as the houses are set in working farming villages, you get a view of Cypriot life that has been almost totally lost elsewhere. </p> <p>\u0095 Sunvil Tours (020-8568 4499, <a href=\"http://www.sunvil.co.uk\">www.sunvil.co.uk</a> offers packages to Laona Project village houses from \u00a3500 a week, including car rental.

      "bodyText": "The environmental pressures of too many tourists have taken a heavy toll on paradise. As the industry becomes increasingly controlled by big companies, local people have seen their cultures commercialised - and their cut of the profits diminished. So, is it still possible to have a good holiday and remain guilt-free? The answer is yes - especially for the independent traveller or people dealing with smaller tour operators that have link-ups with local communities. Here are five places around the world where you can have a guilt-free holiday. Thailand Ko Yao Noi It can be difficult to find the tranquillity that Thailand was once famous for. But Ko Yao Noi (Little Long Island) has kept out the nightly raves and neon sex bars. The islanders have a healthy attitude to tourism, realising that it is useful to supplement their declining fishing incomes, without wanting to abandon their traditional means of livelihood. Like many fishing communities in Asia, they are suffering the effects of illegal fishing by large commercial boats. Tourism is a way of raising funds for a motor patrol vessel and providing them with an alternative income if fishing stocks get too low. Accommodation is in family homes, and visitors can immerse themselves in everyday life on an uncommercialised Thai island. \u0095 TVS-Rest (00 66 2 691 0437, fax: 00 66 2 690 2796, www.welcome.to/tvs organises three-day trips to Ko Yao Noi for \u00a365, including boat trip from Phuket, accommodation in local homes (basic), food with the family and boat trips, and an English-speaking guide. Cyprus Akamas Much of Cyprus has been overdeveloped, but the Akamas peninsula is a protected wilderness, perfect for a quiet, out-of-the-way holiday. Conservation measures are aimed at ensuring that the picturesque villages of the Laona region are being developed to cater for visitors without losing their character. The Laona project and the Cyprus Tourism Organisation have encouraged small-scale, rural tourism that can exist side-by-side with traditional farming. Derelict stone houses are being converted into small-scale craft centres, guest houses and tavernas. The young people, who left in search of a better life in the tourist resorts, are beginning to return. The pace of life is still easy and, as the houses are set in working farming villages, you get a view of Cypriot life that has been almost totally lost elsewhere. \u0095 Sunvil Tours (020-8568 4499, www.sunvil.co.uk offers packages to Laona Project village houses from \u00a3500 a week, including car rental.

Since the 50s, it has admitted more than the handful of Jews it previously allowed to study. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tip O'Neill, tells in his memoirs how he came to hate Harvard almost as much as \"the English\" when he was working for the university as a gardener. But the Irish, once despised and rejected, are now allowed in, conveniently, since they control the politics of Boston where the university is located.

For whatever else it is, Harvard is not essentially an egalitarian institution. It is, proudly and unapologetically, both elite and elitist. It is a ferociously competitive place. It is also authoritarian and hierarchical. Undergraduates see little of the famous professors who drew them to Harvard in the first place. Young academics are kept on tenterhooks for years, teaching and churning out research in the hopes of getting tenure, only to find in a high proportion of cases that they don't make the grade and are sent out into the hinterland to find a job elsewhere. </p> <p>It is a private university, heavily dependent on a vast endowment created by private donations and increased by shrewd investment. As such, and especially because of the shrinking power and wealth of the old New England establishment, which it used to serve, and by which it is still to a surprising extent controlled, it has had to take a series of essentially political decisions to change itself and to broaden its appeal. Its power base is no longer the Lowells and the Cabots who speak only to each other and to God, but Wall Street. </p> <p>Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee says in his autobiography that 51 Bradlees, not to mention Crowninshields and other Brahmin forbears, went to Harvard. The university now makes efforts, as apparently some of the New Labour leadership have been told by their friends in Washington, to bring in young people from a wider socio-economic catchment area. These efforts, while admirable and quite effective, hardly compare in scale or intensity with Harvard's greatest glory, its fund-raising. The effort to bring poor kids to Harvard on scholarship, however welcome, is a public relations campaign. </p> <p>Before we rush to adopt the Harvard solution to the problems of funding a world-class research and teaching university, we should remember a few things. Harvard is seriously expensive. Whereas all British universities were free once a student had been accepted, and now cost less than $1,500 a year, tuition at Harvard is well over $30,000 a year. That is approximately the whole income of the average American. And tuition is only the beginning. To send two children to Harvard for four years each will cost an American family close to half a million dollars. For the average family, that is unthinkable. </p> <p>Funding any serious number of scholarships depends on the US law that allows taxpayers to set their charitable donations against tax. Without that provision, Harvard's endowment would be puny. Does New Labour contemplate relying for the expansion of educational opportunity on tax-free donations to Oxford and Cambridge? </p> <p>Harvard now says that no one who meets the university's requirements will be turned away on grounds of cost alone. That is enlightened, an inspired stroke of public relations. It is also a luxury that few even among US private universities can afford, an unattainable example rather than a solution. In any case, Harvard's British admirers do not perhaps understand just how the Harvard system works. Harvard offers, not free education to those who pass its means test, but a package. Some of the money will come from grants, some from loans, and some from the opportunity to work for the university. (Does Gordon Brown feel comfortable with the idea that poor students at British universities should work for rich students in the kitchen? Because that is the American way.) </p> <p>And then, those loans. It is said that many students leave the Harvard law school and other graduate schools, such as the business school and the medical school, with debts of $75,000 or even more. If they can get jobs with big New York and Washington law firms, their starting pay may be around $100,000 a year. US managers and doctors, too, are paid a high multiple of average salaries. But is this what New Labour wants? That Oxbridge graduates should be obliged to work in the financial services sector, or to emigrate, to pay back a proportion of their fees? </p> <p>It is said that 70% of Harvard students, as against 53% of Oxford's, come from public (meaning state) schools. But a very high proportion of those come from suburban high schools where entry is financially rationed, not by fees, but by the cost of buying homes. It is this suburban factor that makes the search for minority students so urgent for Harvard. </p> <p>The whole Gordon Brown case, if that is not too strong a word for a piece of demagogic improvisation, seems confused. For Harvard's dedicated recruiters must presumably also, like poor John Stein of Magdalen, have to make choices between qualified applicants from equally underprivileged backgrounds. They have one advantage; they are not likely to be second-guessed by the Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers, a Harvard economics professor. </p> <p>Harvard is one of the glories of the American educational system. That does not mean that our politicians should imitate it out of an inferiority complex, any more than they should imitate any other aspect of a foreign country that they understand so imperfectly. </p> <p> Godfrey Hodgson is director of the Reuter Foundation Programme at Green College, Oxford </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

These efforts, while admirable and quite effective, hardly compare in scale or intensity with Harvard's greatest glory, its fund-raising. The effort to bring poor kids to Harvard on scholarship, however welcome, is a public relations campaign. Before we rush to adopt the Harvard solution to the problems of funding a world-class research and teaching university, we should remember a few things. Harvard is seriously expensive. Whereas all British universities were free once a student had been accepted, and now cost less than $1,500 a year, tuition at Harvard is well over $30,000 a year. That is approximately the whole income of the average American. And tuition is only the beginning. To send two children to Harvard for four years each will cost an American family close to half a million dollars. For the average family, that is unthinkable. Funding any serious number of scholarships depends on the US law that allows taxpayers to set their charitable donations against tax. Without that provision, Harvard's endowment would be puny. Does New Labour contemplate relying for the expansion of educational opportunity on tax-free donations to Oxford and Cambridge? Harvard now says that no one who meets the university's requirements will be turned away on grounds of cost alone. That is enlightened, an inspired stroke of public relations. It is also a luxury that few even among US private universities can afford, an unattainable example rather than a solution. In any case, Harvard's British admirers do not perhaps understand just how the Harvard system works. Harvard offers, not free education to those who pass its means test, but a package. Some of the money will come from grants, some from loans, and some from the opportunity to work for the university. (Does Gordon Brown feel comfortable with the idea that poor students at British universities should work for rich students in the kitchen? Because that is the American way.) And then, those loans. It is said that many students leave the Harvard law school and other graduate schools, such as the business school and the medical school, with debts of $75,000 or even more. If they can get jobs with big New York and Washington law firms, their starting pay may be around $100,000 a year. US managers and doctors, too, are paid a high multiple of average salaries. But is this what New Labour wants? That Oxbridge graduates should be obliged to work in the financial services sector, or to emigrate, to pay back a proportion of their fees? It is said that 70% of Harvard students, as against 53% of Oxford's, come from public (meaning state) schools. But a very high proportion of those come from suburban high schools where entry is financially rationed, not by fees, but by the cost of buying homes. It is this suburban factor that makes the search for minority students so urgent for Harvard. The whole Gordon Brown case, if that is not too strong a word for a piece of demagogic improvisation, seems confused. For Harvard's dedicated recruiters must presumably also, like poor John Stein of Magdalen, have to make choices between qualified applicants from equally underprivileged backgrounds. They have one advantage; they are not likely to be second-guessed by the Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers, a Harvard economics professor. Harvard is one of the glories of the American educational system. That does not mean that our politicians should imitate it out of an inferiority complex, any more than they should imitate any other aspect of a foreign country that they understand so imperfectly.

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday refused to back down on its new stance of \"opportunity for all\" when the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, again insisted that universities were not doing enough to attract students from poor backgrounds. Mr Prescott's relatively mild remarks, after seven days of high octane attacks on elitism, brought an angry reaction from leading academics in the north, who accused him of being ignorant and badly briefed. The government regards Mr Prescott as an excellent advocate of opportunity for all in education, since he himself failed his 11 plus but was subsequently given a place at Ruskin College in Oxford, from which he then prospered. The row had been fuelled over a week ago when Gordon Brown attacked Magdalen College, Oxford, for its \"scandalous\" rejection of the state school pupil Laura Spence, despite her excellent academic record. In a speech on Tyneside, Mr Prescott said: \"We believe many universities north and south could do more to attract people of ability regardless of their backgrounds.\" He also said he felt \"sensitive\" about the fact that regional universities did not take enough students from their own areas. Discussing his own education, he said: \"I felt lucky because there were many people who I felt had equal ability but just didn't get the chance to develop it. \"It is not only immoral to write people off like that, it doesn't even make economic sense because, in a world of change, learning and adapting are the key to success for individuals and the whole country - and we still haven't gone far enough. \"So where there are barriers to learning and opportunity, our job is to take them down for all people.\" Later he added: \"Whether we are talking about universities in the north or the south, it is for all of us to ensure a better spread of standards.\" But he added that some universities in the north were doing a great deal to improve standards. Labour party and government sources stressed that his comments were not intended as an attack on any individual university. Despite the emollient words, there was protest by Durham University's vice-chancellor, Sir Kenneth Calman. He said: \"It is clear from some of the things being said by ministers that they have not been well briefed about the efforts that universities such as Durham have been making for a number of years.\" James Wright, the vice-chancellor of Newcastle University, said ministers who were critical of admissions policies were \"not really aware of the facts\". He pointed out that his university had offered a place to study medicine to Laura Spence, but that she had turned it down. \"I am unhappy with the way [ministers] are addressing the situation. \"We wouldn't be putting in all these efforts ourselves if we didn't think there was a problem to be addressed.

The shadow education secretary, Theresa May, said Mr Prescott was attacking a university a day. The Liberal Democrats' higher education spokesman, Evan Harris, adopted an attack from the left. \"It is breathtakingly hypocritical of senior cabinet ministers like John Prescott, Gordon Brown, David Blunkett and the prime minister - all of whom benefited from grants and free tuition - to refuse to own up to the difficulties caused by their government's abolition of maintenance grants and the imposition of tuition fees,\" he said.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If you liked the Dome, you will adore Expo 2000. In case you are unfamiliar with the concept, the jamboree, which opened in Hanover two days ago and runs until October 31, is the latest in a line of Universal Expositions stretching back to one held in London in 1851 - the Great Exhibition for which Crystal Palace was built. The best attended was the Osaka Expo of 1970, which drew 64 million people. The last, in Seville eight years ago, attracted only 41m, and the organisers of this one are aiming to do no more than match the Spaniards' tally, even though Hanover's catchment area is much more densely inhabited. </p> <p>The signs, in other words, are that this is a concept on the retreat, as might be expected in an age when people no longer need to go to a specific place to learn of the latest technological advances. There will be even less pretence in Hanover than there was in Seville that visitors are being shown the newest the age has to offer. </p> <p>For those of you who saw the last Universal Exposition, Hanover's will look reassuringly, or disappointingly, familiar. Many of the same elements will be there: the cable cars, the water walls, the 360-degree screens, and the daffy-looking mascot. This time round, he/she/it is called Twipsy and is meant to be a data carrier on the internet. </p> <p>The age group most likely to be thrilled by Expo probably begins at eight and goes up to around 14. Anyone under eight is unlikely to be up to the rigours of a visit that the organisers recommend should last at least three days. Indeed, they have set up a special kiddy park at which parents can leave children in the care of the Red Cross for DM5 (\u00a31.60) an hour. </p> <p>One of the most promising-sounding events is aimed directly at this pre-adolescent generation. A Fun Sports area has been created at which some of the world's leading experts will be on hand to teach the finer points of BMX biking, inline skating, rock-climbing and the like. For the slightly older, \"reluctant-teenager-on-holiday-with-mum-and-dad-for-maybe-the-last-time\", there will be an Expo disco with a capacity of 4,000. Entry will be free after midnight. </p> <p>What mum and dad themselves find to interest them will depend very much on their personal outlooks. There are three main elements at a Universal Exposition: a thematic area arranged by the hosts; the pavilions built by the participating nations and organisations, and a cultural programme. This last depends partly on the hosts and partly on the participants, who often bring in top-flight artists and entertainers for their national days. </p> <p>With 15,000 events, ranging from 20-minute mime shows to a cycle of performances of Goethe's 21-hour Faust, Expo 2000's cultural programme is certainly extensive. But the early indications are that the organisers will not be laying on as many big names as did the Spanish in 1992. </p> <p>Expo's PRs say there will be \"everybody from Shirley Bassey to Carlos Santana\", a phrase that seems to stop some way short of encompassing the cultural universe. Peter Brook, the Berlin Philharmonic, Pina Bausch's dance company and Stomp are among other offerings in a programme that puts the emphasis on \"crossover\". There will also be a film festival with showings every night throughout the five months the Exposition is open. </p> <p>How rich the cultural programmes of the individual nations will be is anybody's guess. There is always a hit-or-miss aspect to visiting an Expo. You can find yourself watching an unforgettable concert - or the Swiss Cream Cheese Producers' Yodelling Ensemble on an off day. </p> <p>The theme of Expo 2000 is \"Humankind, Nature and Technology\". So eco-consciousness is very much on the agenda. There will be no monster fireworks displays. Instead, water is to be shot 40 metres into the night sky and images projected on to it by laser. All the pavilions will be dismantled or recycled when the fair is over. Some will have been earmarked for a new purpose - for example, the Vatican's building is to be re-erected in Latvia (such details are meat and drink to the true Expo junkie). </p> <p>The Germans are planning to go one better than a mere 360-degree cinema experience and offer visitors what is billed as a 720-degree cinema experience. It apparently involves the same images taken from different angles being projected on to no less than nine screens. </p> <p>Britain's pavilion is a mystery. When I toured the site, there was an elegant, though scarcely original, steel-and-glass structure to which workers were attaching red, white and blue motifs. But the organisers said they had no idea what would go into it, and their promotional literature is reduced to noting that the pavilion has \"an interesting flexible interior, whereby interior walls can be moved to create different rooms and spaces\". </p> <p>The Finns have brought in part of a forest. The Icelandic pavilion will spout a geyser and the Venezuelan pavilion will be a replica of a sunflower. </p> <p>Arguably the most interesting of them all, though, will be that of Ethiopia where they plan to exhibit the remains of our earliest known forebear, \"Lucy\" (age: 3.2 million years). In case you were wondering what a country with a famine and a war on its hands is doing spending \u00a31 million flying the flag, the Ethiopians say all the money came from private sponsors and a German government subsidy. </p> <p>The only nation of note not there will be the United States, whose legislators have banned any further investment of public cash in such events. But then the US will be effortlessly represented anyhow. There will be 11 sites at which you can buy a Big Mac and it is a dollar to a sinking euro that this Greenest of Expos will end each day brimming with discarded Coca-Cola beakers. </p> <p><strong>What to see beyond the Expo gates</strong></p> <p>Have you never heard the saying \"See Hanover and die\"? Or the song \"My kind of town, Han-o-ver is\" ? No? Well, there are some very good reasons for that. </p> <p>The \"Messestadt\" or \"Exhibition City\", as it calls itself, has some beautiful gardens and a huge, splendid, artificial lake, the Maschensee. But, for the most part, it is an unexceptional place and few of the visitors who go there for Expo 2000 will want to extend their holiday for the sake of the city alone. </p> <p>That does not mean, however, that there are not good reasons for staying on in the vicinity. </p> <p>Imagine, for a moment, a town of cobbled streets lined with half-timbered houses. The houses lean into and away from each other at often bizarre angles. They have been built up in layers, with each storey overhanging the street at a more precipitous angle than the one below. They have steeply-pitched roofs and pastel-coloured facades. On the timbers, there are gilded inscriptions left behind by proud and pious, long-dead burghers. </p> <p>Just outside the centre, there is a park with a tiny ornamental lake. Nearby is a stately \"schloss\" with white walls, red roofs and its own theatre and chapel. </p> <p>Imagining such a town is as close as most people are ever likely to get, so many of its kind having been bombed to ruins between 1939 and 1945. Yet, 30 miles north of Hanover, it has survived. </p> <p>It is called Celle, and is less than an hour away by train from the Expo 2000 site. If you stay for a week, you'll have time to do the exposition thoroughly, look around Celle and then perhaps hire a car to explore the byways of the nearby countryside. </p> <p>The L\u00fcneburg heath is among the least spoilt areas of rural Germany, an expanse of barely undulating sandy terrain, interspersed with forests. The area is renowned for its honey, and you can some times catch the scent of it on the breeze, mingled with hints of conifer resins and aromatic plants. </p> <p>South of Celle, there is the remarkable 13th- century Cistercian convent of Wienhausen - a towering, ivy-clad, red-brick structure with a style all of its own. It is open to the public until 6pm. </p> <p>But stay on after the nuns have shut their doors and take a walk through the surrounding village, past the ancient wooden belfry, across the bridge over the mill stream to the half-timbered M\u00fchlengrund. This is a guest house-cum-restaurant-cum-pub where the Kollmann family brew their own beer on the premises. The beer comes cloudy, unfiltered and irresistible. </p> <p>Carry your drink out to the garden and savour it as you gaze out at the broad mill pond, smothered with lily pads. If you catch the muffled notes of the organ in the church over the water, you may even fancy you have gone to heaven. </p> <p>The other big tourist attraction in the area, about 13 miles north of Celle, is the site of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. But, then, that's Germany for you.</p> <p><strong>Best bars and caf\u00e9s</strong></p> <p><strong>Hanover</strong></p> <p> <strong> Harry's New York Bar</strong> Podbielskistrasse 145.

Anyone under eight is unlikely to be up to the rigours of a visit that the organisers recommend should last at least three days. Indeed, they have set up a special kiddy park at which parents can leave children in the care of the Red Cross for DM5 (\u00a31.60) an hour. One of the most promising-sounding events is aimed directly at this pre-adolescent generation. A Fun Sports area has been created at which some of the world's leading experts will be on hand to teach the finer points of BMX biking, inline skating, rock-climbing and the like. For the slightly older, \"reluctant-teenager-on-holiday-with-mum-and-dad-for-maybe-the-last-time\", there will be an Expo disco with a capacity of 4,000. Entry will be free after midnight. What mum and dad themselves find to interest them will depend very much on their personal outlooks. There are three main elements at a Universal Exposition: a thematic area arranged by the hosts; the pavilions built by the participating nations and organisations, and a cultural programme. This last depends partly on the hosts and partly on the participants, who often bring in top-flight artists and entertainers for their national days. With 15,000 events, ranging from 20-minute mime shows to a cycle of performances of Goethe's 21-hour Faust, Expo 2000's cultural programme is certainly extensive. But the early indications are that the organisers will not be laying on as many big names as did the Spanish in 1992. Expo's PRs say there will be \"everybody from Shirley Bassey to Carlos Santana\", a phrase that seems to stop some way short of encompassing the cultural universe. Peter Brook, the Berlin Philharmonic, Pina Bausch's dance company and Stomp are among other offerings in a programme that puts the emphasis on \"crossover\". There will also be a film festival with showings every night throughout the five months the Exposition is open. How rich the cultural programmes of the individual nations will be is anybody's guess. There is always a hit-or-miss aspect to visiting an Expo. You can find yourself watching an unforgettable concert - or the Swiss Cream Cheese Producers' Yodelling Ensemble on an off day. The theme of Expo 2000 is \"Humankind, Nature and Technology\". So eco-consciousness is very much on the agenda. There will be no monster fireworks displays. Instead, water is to be shot 40 metres into the night sky and images projected on to it by laser. All the pavilions will be dismantled or recycled when the fair is over. Some will have been earmarked for a new purpose - for example, the Vatican's building is to be re-erected in Latvia (such details are meat and drink to the true Expo junkie). The Germans are planning to go one better than a mere 360-degree cinema experience and offer visitors what is billed as a 720-degree cinema experience. It apparently involves the same images taken from different angles being projected on to no less than nine screens. Britain's pavilion is a mystery. When I toured the site, there was an elegant, though scarcely original, steel-and-glass structure to which workers were attaching red, white and blue motifs. But the organisers said they had no idea what would go into it, and their promotional literature is reduced to noting that the pavilion has \"an interesting flexible interior, whereby interior walls can be moved to create different rooms and spaces\". The Finns have brought in part of a forest. The Icelandic pavilion will spout a geyser and the Venezuelan pavilion will be a replica of a sunflower. Arguably the most interesting of them all, though, will be that of Ethiopia where they plan to exhibit the remains of our earliest known forebear, \"Lucy\" (age: 3.2 million years). In case you were wondering what a country with a famine and a war on its hands is doing spending \u00a31 million flying the flag, the Ethiopians say all the money came from private sponsors and a German government subsidy. The only nation of note not there will be the United States, whose legislators have banned any further investment of public cash in such events. But then the US will be effortlessly represented anyhow. There will be 11 sites at which you can buy a Big Mac and it is a dollar to a sinking euro that this Greenest of Expos will end each day brimming with discarded Coca-Cola beakers. What to see beyond the Expo gates Have you never heard the saying \"See Hanover and die\"? Or the song \"My kind of town, Han-o-ver is\" ? No? Well, there are some very good reasons for that. The \"Messestadt\" or \"Exhibition City\", as it calls itself, has some beautiful gardens and a huge, splendid, artificial lake, the Maschensee. But, for the most part, it is an unexceptional place and few of the visitors who go there for Expo 2000 will want to extend their holiday for the sake of the city alone. That does not mean, however, that there are not good reasons for staying on in the vicinity. Imagine, for a moment, a town of cobbled streets lined with half-timbered houses. The houses lean into and away from each other at often bizarre angles. They have been built up in layers, with each storey overhanging the street at a more precipitous angle than the one below. They have steeply-pitched roofs and pastel-coloured facades. On the timbers, there are gilded inscriptions left behind by proud and pious, long-dead burghers. Just outside the centre, there is a park with a tiny ornamental lake. Nearby is a stately \"schloss\" with white walls, red roofs and its own theatre and chapel. Imagining such a town is as close as most people are ever likely to get, so many of its kind having been bombed to ruins between 1939 and 1945. Yet, 30 miles north of Hanover, it has survived. It is called Celle, and is less than an hour away by train from the Expo 2000 site. If you stay for a week, you'll have time to do the exposition thoroughly, look around Celle and then perhaps hire a car to explore the byways of the nearby countryside. The L\u00fcneburg heath is among the least spoilt areas of rural Germany, an expanse of barely undulating sandy terrain, interspersed with forests. The area is renowned for its honey, and you can some times catch the scent of it on the breeze, mingled with hints of conifer resins and aromatic plants. South of Celle, there is the remarkable 13th- century Cistercian convent of Wienhausen - a towering, ivy-clad, red-brick structure with a style all of its own. It is open to the public until 6pm. But stay on after the nuns have shut their doors and take a walk through the surrounding village, past the ancient wooden belfry, across the bridge over the mill stream to the half-timbered M\u00fchlengrund. This is a guest house-cum-restaurant-cum-pub where the Kollmann family brew their own beer on the premises. The beer comes cloudy, unfiltered and irresistible. Carry your drink out to the garden and savour it as you gaze out at the broad mill pond, smothered with lily pads. If you catch the muffled notes of the organ in the church over the water, you may even fancy you have gone to heaven. The other big tourist attraction in the area, about 13 miles north of Celle, is the site of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. But, then, that's Germany for you.

I was visiting her at the time with Glenn and William. She hadn't seen Ted for 21 years, because of a row about a clock. She was adamant that she wanted to return to her own home. Ted said: \"You're being daft, Mam. You can't live on your own at the age of 95. If you won't go into a nursing home, you'll have to come and live with me and Eunice.\" A look of horror passed over her multi-wrinkled face. While Ted went to telephone Eunice, Mrs Wormington clutched at my sleeve. She said, \"Don't let him take me to live with him and Eunice. I'll be dead in a week. That Eunice is a miserable bugger - she's never been known to crack her face.\" When Ted came back, he said that Eunice was still resentful about the clock. Glenn announced, \"It's alright, she's comin' 'ome with us.\" I could easily have killed him. Friday, June 2 Mrs Wormington has been slagging off the Queen Mother. \"She's never done a hand's turn in her life,\" she said. \"No wonder she's always smilin'.\" She moves in with us tomorrow.

She has sometimes used masks and other disguises to remove the face that is our immediate visual clue to a person; it's as if she distrusts the face.

It's a hilarious, ludicrous image of ecstasy, as someone appears to go off their head in a public place. But it also has that quality of another person being absolutely there, and at the same time absolutely other, that is characteristic of great portraits. </p> <p>If that sounds too much, try a south Londoner, William Blake: \"The most sublime act is to set another before you.\" This portrait is an attempt to become, rather than to paint, another person.

The dancer, Gillian Wearing, under the vaulted glass roof, on the shiny pavement, has a look of intense seriousness on her face. She throws her hair about, shakes, gets down. She looks ridiculous, in a public place in broad daylight. She is not dancing to a Walkman, just to sounds in her head. Before making the video she practised dancing to some of her favourite music - Nirvana, Queen, Gloria Gaynor. </p> <p>In the course of the tape she changes style, moving to different imaginary sounds. In all that time no one comes up to her, no one stops her. They walk on by, looking contemptuous or indifferent. The piece multiplies mysteries. The other people, the ones walking by, become as mysterious as the dancer. Those old people in the background - who are they? That boy striding past in dark glasses - what is he thinking? This is simultaneously a portrait of an unnamed woman seen at the Royal Festival Hall, a self-portrait, and an image of what it is to be lost in a private rhapsody. </p> <p><strong> Did she like it?</strong> \"You don't expect to see something like that in Peckham,\" Wearing said. </p> <p><strong> Where is it?</strong> Southampton City Art Gallery, Civic Centre, Southampton (023-8083 2277) until Monday (returning in November). </p>",

Third, fourth, maybe up to a dozen now, each picking a separate chord, but holding the harmony. An oceanic shiver runs up my spine as a single voice peaks into a piercing, mesmeric solo. Siren. Demon lover. The call of the wild. Someone, some American writer I can't recall in this winter Yellowstone dark, described this eerie choral epiphany as \"the jubilation of wolves\". </p> <p>They are jubilant, the gray wolves out there in the waltzing snow. They came back to Yellowstone Park in 1995. Shipped in from Canada, resented by local farmers and ranch-holders, a battle was fought on their behalf through the federal courts and, just weeks before I set out across the States and the snows to find them, won the right to stay, to den and breed in the world's first and most popular national park. </p> <p>The gray wolf lived in Yellowstone as it did over much of North America and what is now the US for thousands of years. To native Americans and the Innuit people, they were brother and sister hunters, revered and celebrated in dance, dress and song. They featured positively in creation myths. The wolf is supremely indifferent to human beings, and yet from the cautious dance between wolf packs and human tribes the domestic dog (c anis familiaris) emerged probably some 15,000 years ago. Man and dog have been, for the most part, best friends ever since. Yet the wolf, to whom we owe setters and retrievers, deerhounds and wolfhounds, mutts, poodles and Pekinese, has been treated by most of humankind as an enemy to be hunted down and killed, or else pushed to the margins of barely habitable wilderness and into the imaginative extremes of myth, legend and fairy-tale. </p> <p>The farmers and ranch-owners of north-west Wyoming, the territory of Yellowstone Park, were up in arms over the reintroduction of the gray (or timber or tundra) wolf because they feared for their livestock. Crazy figures were barked about: each wolf, it was said in the case for the prosecution, would impose a cost of $1.8 million on local livestock keepers. The case for the defence counter-claimed: the Yellowstone wolves would cost the nation half the price of a US postage stamp per head per year. The truth was hard to pin down. At first, the wolves lost. There was an appeal. In December 1997, a federal judge in Wyoming ordered their removal. Over the following two years, the case for the wolf was promoted assiduously by Yellowstone Park rangers, by much of the US conservation lobby and by the dozens of wolf-dancing groups you'll find by typing \"wolf\" into your internet search engine. Before the Yellowstone snows melted this year, the wolves had won. </p> <p>A small step for wildlife supporters the world over, a giant leap for wolfkind. This is the first time wolves have lived on a regular basis this far south in the US since 1923 when, according to official records, the last wolf den was destroyed near Tower Falls, Yellowstone Park. Those last wolves were gunned down by the National Park Service, set up in 1916 to protect Yellowstone Park, but also to keep it safe and well-stocked for hunters in pursuit of the game that wolves fed on. Pumas were exterminated at much the same time. Although wolves prowled into the park until the 40s, they all but vanished for more than half a century. Today, many of the three million visitors who come to Yellowstone Park each year come in the hope of hearing and, if they're lucky, seeing a real live wolf. There are somewhere between 140 and 180 wolves living wild in Yellowstone today, as wary of those three million visitors as western people were once of the species canis lupus . </p> <p>In the light of my torch, as wolfish jubilation fades into a snow-muffled echo, I unpack the books I have brought with me, and read of the life and myth of the wolf. Despite its bad press over the centuries, the hunting peoples of the world have never had a quarrel to settle with the wolf; but those who settled, farmed and kept livestock have. Wolves are brilliant and stealthy hunters, preying on weak, old or lost sheep, deer, elks, bison, caribou. They are fast, lithe and strong, yet use their sharp intelligence - they are much brighter than dogs - to get food as readily as they can. Farms were always going to be an easy target, until the arrival of the gun. Although wolves do not normally attack or eat humans, their reputation for being big, bad and voracious went before them in fright history and folklore. The wolf represented the wildness from which humankind wanted to believe its gods had somehow rescued it. From the time humans began to settle and farm, the wolf was perceived as both a physical and psychological threat. </p> <p>Strangely, when I get to meet a wolf nose-to-muzzle, an Alpha male, his amber eyes looking into the grey-green of my own, equally cautious, equally shy, I can't help but be surprised by his size as well as his extreme beauty. Size, because this superb animal is much smaller than the imagination expects us to believe. But not that small. He is about 6ft long, a little less than 3ft to the shoulder, perhaps, and, I learn later, weighs about 120lbs. His chest is much narrower than many large dogs: he is streamlined in Nature's fashion. He can run for several hours at an easy 25mph, and can top 40mph in a sprint to the kill, which may be over a distance of anything from a 100 yards to three miles. He can leap vertically and jump up rocks with the agility of a cat. And, yes, he can dance. Although I didn't join them - I'm not a Hollywood star, sadly - I watched as a pack of wolves danced in the evening before setting off on a hunt. And, yes, they sing as they dance. It is a magic sight, and one that I thought belonged to fairy-tales and the kind of films that make me cry behind ice-cream cartons. (Sometimes with embarrassment, it has to be said.) </p> <p>My wolf looked right into my eyes and, if he didn't wag his tail - wolves rarely do compared with eager-to-please domestic dogs - he offered no threat. Far from it. As he turned to pad away on his huge paws (much bigger than a big dog's) and long, sinewy legs, silently and with the grace of a natural aristocrat, I called to mind snatches of Jack London's Call Of The Wild, one of the first books I took out of a public library. \"He had done this thing before, somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world, and he was doing it again now, running free in the open, the unpacked earth underfoot, the wide sky overhead.\" </p> <p>That was Buck, the half-wolf thinking in London's imagination, yet there is a Buck in most of us. And maybe a wolf. No matter how hard we try to get it out with Optrex, to wash it away it with new-formula Flash, to flush it through the odour-trapping u-bends of champagne-coloured lavatory basins, to erect every sort of conceivable barrier to keep the wolf from our door, the call of the wild is still there. It rings in the ear like tinnitus. Switch on the electric lights, spray Airwick around the room, put on some nice, civilised music, drench yourself in Mitsouko or CK1, shave your legs every day, marry a nice, safe person who seems as far from the wolf as Little Red Riding Hood thought herself, yet the wolf will still howl. In you, if not in someone else. </p> <p>What we have always feared in the wolf is the walk on the wild side that we yearn for, yet fear to tread. Today, even if it wanted to, the fur and blood wolf can do us little harm. It has been exiled from, extinguished in, many of its former homelands. In the US, its legally-approved return to Yellowstone Park means that it now roams silently, save for the howling, through the mountain fringes of Wyoming, a high-plains drifter in Idaho and Montana, as well as scratching out a fairly unmolested living in Alaska, parts of Canada, northern Minnesota, Isle Royale and Glacier National Park. Far from hearth and home. Protected at long last alongside other predators bedevilled by farmers and wimps - mountain lions, grizzly bears and coyotes - the wolf has taken up its time-honoured place in the natural order of things, culling the weak, the old and the ill from herds of deer, elk and bison. And bringing epic poetry back into epic landscapes. </p> <p> Not once in my sub-zero trek across Yellowstone did I expect to be threatened by a wolf. I had written this quote from Edward Hoagland's Red Wolves And Black Bears in my notebook: \"We know that the folklore was exaggerated, that generally wolves don't attack man, which is a relief, but we treasure the stories nonetheless, wanting the woods to be woods.\" Dark woods, secret woods, woods where wolves might lurk and howl in competition with banshees. Woods where teddy bears would not be having a picnic today or any other day. I was brought up not to trust people who don't like dogs, and not simply because dogs are best friends and don't lie about love, but because the only nasty dogs I have ever met have been made so by the kind of human beings you wish a big bad wolf of legend would come and gobble up. But that would be a crime. </p> <p>As for the Yellowstone wolves, they've been on trial legally and scientifically for crimes that they may or may not have committed against sheep and cattle. The original Canadian settlers were fitted-up with radio collars to see if and where they would settle, and whether or not they would attack livestock. The radio collars fall off eventually and, as each season passes, the wolves are increasingly free to follow their own secret, richly scented lives, free, too, from the prying eyes of humankind. </p> <p>Just for now, though, some of us have sought the privilege of knowing roughly where the wolves are and - as far as this is possible with such a shy animal - to meet, if not going so far as to dine, with them. The only creatures who feel confident enough to do this are the ravens who help guide wolves to the kill; to sick animals, for the most part. The wolves do the killing with suddenness and lightning speed, and while they scythe through the bone and muscle of their prey, the ravens get to peck away at the side-orders and relishes. Unwelcome dinner guests may include the smaller coyote and, sometimes, the very much smaller fox; wolves, however, will attack and kill both of these in certain circumstances, as they will members of rival packs who stray into their clearly-marked territory and show no sign of leaving when threatened. </p> <p>It's best not to sup with a wolf, not least because it will make mincemeat of a dish that you couldn't begin to tackle without a chainsaw and a cookbook. A wolf's 42 extremely large teeth are ideally suited to slashing and cracking through heavy bones and dense muscle. Their jaws can exert a pressure of 1,500lbs per square inch, twice that of a large dog. Diner, beware. Especially the Red Riding Hoods among you. </p> <p>Red Riding Hood was, of course, the sexual innocent, who allowed herself to be devoured by the big bad wolf on a day, presumably, when he wasn't trying to huff and puff and blow the little pigs' house down. The wolf was said, in legend, to be sexually predatory, as well as unpredictable and treacherous. My dictionary defines \"wolf\", aside from the obvious, as \"a voracious, grabbing, or fiercely cruel person or thing \", and as \"a man who habitually tries to seduce women\". It reminds me that men \"wolf-whistle\" after women walking past scaffolding, that \"lupa\", the Latin and Italian for wolf, signifies a prostitute, that a wolf-note is \"an unpleasant sound produced in some notes played on the violin\", that to \"cry wolf\" is \"to give a false alarm\". There are so many bad connotations attached to the name \"wolf\" that we seem to have met with the devil himself. And, if we look through a translation of a 12th-century bestiary made by T H White, this is just what some our forbears thought: \"The devil bears the similitude of a wolf, he who is always looking over the human race with his evil eye and darkly prowling around the sheepfolds of the faithful so that he may afflict and ruin their souls... its eyes shine in the night like lamps because the works of the devil are everywhere thought to seem beautiful and salubrious...\" </p> <p>But the wolf is not a sexual predator. In fact, for 10 months out of 12, it is effectively celibate. Packs - usually around a dozen animals, but occasionally as many as three dozen - celebrate their sexuality over a two-month period between April and June, when they den and produce cubs that are much-loved not only by their parents but also by the pack. Wolves are devoted parents. Mothers are spoilt by the pack, which brings them not only food (much of it freshly regurgitated, liquidised, baby-food-style, for the cubs) but toys, too. Wolves are playful. They play games of tag, Frisbee with bones, tugs-of-war: all these doubtless help to develop hunting skills, but no one seeing wolves in the wild will ever doubt that they enjoy playing as much as humans do. The two teenage males that loped alongside me for several hundred yards as I ski'd, accelerated at one point into a sprint, their tales wrapped across one another's tawny flanks. They were having a ball in the fresh fall of snow. </p> <p>Wolves may or may not mate for life. During most of the year, however, they live contentedly with one another - although there are occasional squabbles and fallings-out when lone wolves leave to find new mates and adopt a new pack. The affection that wolves show one another is quite magical compared with much human behaviour. It is, of course, humans who are sexually predatory, and humans who have unloaded their fears and inadequacies on the wolf. Just as minority races have been blamed and persecuted for war, pestilence, famine, unemployment and general malaise, so too the innocent and good-natured wolf. </p> <p>The ruthlessness with which the wolf was driven from Europe and then much of North America between, say, 1450 and 1950 was extraordinary. And the way in which we could even damn the wolf's peerless song - calling an ugly note a \"wolf note\" - shows just how deep the gap between our disinfected lives and the natural order had grown. Only the most gifted musicians, the greatest singers can match the near unearthly beauty of wolves in full song. Unearthly, not because they are out of tune with nature - few animals are so well adapted to the many habitats they have been forced to survive in and enjoy - but because they sing at their best when the moon is full and on nights when the stars, especially Sirius, shine their brightest, which in Yellowstone - away from the smoke of two-stroke snowmobiles and the plumes of steam shot up to as much as 1,000ft by 300 or so geysers - is very bright indeed. </p> <p>The full moon is also the time when lunatics bay and lycanthropics howl into the night sky, when werewolves prowl, banshees wail, witches are abroad and vampires flutter under eaves, hoping for the jugular. There are genuine cases of lycanthropy, in which victims go on all fours, howl, desire raw meat and lacerate themselves, but these are far rarer than reports of werewolves. Werewolves were believed to exist not only in the mind of Peter Cushing's professors and puritans in Hammer horror films, but by the clergy and faithful of medieval Europe and after. </p> <p>The last religious study treating werewolves as dangerous fact was written by the clerical scholar Montague Summers in 1961. \"A werewolf,\" he wrote, \"is a human being, man, woman or child (more often the first) who either voluntarily or involuntarily changes or is metamorphosed into the apparent shape of a wolf, and who is then possessed of all the characteristics, the foul appetites, ferocity, cunning, the brute strength, and swiftness of that animal.\" Werewolfery, he suggested, is either hereditary or acquired, a horrible pleasure born of the thirst to quaff warm human blood. The beast's appetites were \"depraved beyond humanity\", its greatest desire was to rut bestially, offering \"foul sacrifice\" to the \"Monstrous Goat who sat upon the throne of worship and adoration\". </p> <p>The werewolf has been a popular theme in horror novels and films since the late 18th century. From Bram Stoker to the world of celluloid nightmares - The Howling, An American Werewolf In London and beyond - this fear of the wolf, of the wild in us that might suddenly kidnap our rational mind, continues to haunt our most gothic dreams. </p> <p>Yet the real horror has been active in the minds and expressed in the acts of those who have adopted the satanic view of the wolf without understanding anything of the mind of the altruistic animal they adopt as a symbol. Most notorious of these was Adolf Hitler. To his niece and lover, Geli Raubal, he was Herr Wolf. His eastern command headquarters in the Silesian forest was the Wolfsschanze (wolf's lair), from where German forces were ordered to commit many of their greatest atrocities. Beware the wolf that's foe to man. </p> <p>Hitler was affected by the Nordic legends in which wolves played major roles. Perhaps he identified with Fenris, the giant wolf of destruction whose sister Hel, goddess of the underworld, was bound for aeons - kept in waiting in Hitler's terms - by a magic rope spun by dwarves (imperial and Weimar politicians) until unleashed at G\u00f6tterdammerung, the twilight of the gods, when the sun and moon were devoured by wolf giants. Fenris swallowed Odin, chief of the gods, before himself being slain. The world was consumed by fire, but reborn to a new (and hopefully better) human race. </p> <p>Curiously, though, there are counter legends through history that tell of the noble nature of the wolf. The most famous of these is, of course, that of Romulus and Remus and the founding of Rome in 753BC. The twins were born the sons of the god of war, Mars, and Rhea Silva, daughter of Numitor, king of Alba Longa. Exposed to die, they were suckled by a she-wolf and discovered and then brought up by the husband-and-wife peasants, Faustulus and Acca Larentia. Perhaps they would have done better staying with the wolf. Or, at least Remus might have. As Cain slew Abel, Romulus slew Remus. Far from being punished, he went on to found Rome, and when he died in 716BC he ascended into heaven in a chariot of fire sent by Mars and drawn by wolves. He then became the god Quirinus. Not bad for a wolf-suckled murderer, but whoever said the gods were fair? And the wolf? Well, she was probably nothing more and nothing less than a good-hearted \"lupa\", a lady of the night who may or may not have howled at the moon. </p> <p>More touching is Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, in which Mowgli, the naked man-cub is adopted by a pack of wolves. \"'Is that a man's cub?' said Mother Wolf. 'I have never seen one. Bring it here.' A wolf accustomed to moving his own cubs can, if necessary, mouth an egg without breaking it, and though Father Wolf's jaws closed right on the child's back not a tooth even scratched the skin as he laid it down among the cubs.\" Kipling drew Mowgli from stories of feral children supposedly brought up by wolves. There have been several cases, all rather dubious, but in some of our dreams at least wolves, who are model parents, would be a lot more fun and very much more caring than all too many of their human counterparts. </p> <p>There's something else, though, something more important. The wolf, as I always knew and now know better from looking into the infinite depths of those amber eyes, not only shares a kindred intelligence with us, but teaches us that it is possible to live a lively, playful, fully engaged and thoughtful life in tune rather than detached from nature. Our claim, as humans, to be somehow superior to nature has always been specious. \"A mountain with a wolf on it stands a little higher,\" wrote Edward Hoagland. And it does, just as a great engineer can improve a landscape with a beautiful bridge, working with the sweep, the curve, the torso of the landscape and not against it. The image of the bridge shows that we can have our rational-scientific world and respect nature. The wolf on the mountain, out there in the Rockies, in the Apennines and Spanish Pyrenees, represents a state of natural grace that we do not know or cannot obtain, yet yearn for in our bones. A wildness that we beat away from ourselves by persecuting the wolf. </p> <p>It has been extraordinary to sense just how hostile or plain fearful so many people are when the words \"wolf\" and \"reintroduction\" are mentioned. Recent discussions about the possibility of wolves being re-released into the Scottish highlands have been hampered not just by local livestock owners, but by those who seem to imagine that a walk across the glens in some lupine future would mean ramblers being torn to pieces by wild dogs absurdly craving the e-number blood of hikers. Or that conservationists are about to clone Sue, the star American Tyrannosaurus rex and set her test-tube offspring clumping through the heather. A wolf would be all but invisible to man in the wilderness of the Highlands. More wild animals are killed by socially ambitious dimwits with guns in Scotland than a sustainable number of wolves ever could, even if they were greedy, which they are not, or stupid, which they aren't, either. Just the thought that the wolf was out there would be enough to make the Highlands, special as they are, feel that bit closer to Arcady. </p> <p>There are wolves in the distant provinces of Siberia, China and India. There are wolves, in fact, in small numbers hiding from human beings wherever they can, in the interstices of the belching, farting, besmirched and fouled world we smugly believe is better than that of the wolf, which is so light on its feet that the only mark it leaves of its passing is the gentlest imprints of its big paws in the Wyoming snow. </p> <p>I sit in the snow and watch my gray wolf ripple into the forest. I won't move until the cold is too much to bear because I want him to stay in view, to imprint himself on my mind's eye, for as long as possible. He'll run if I move, and as he can hear me up to six miles away, pick up my scent from at least two, he'll know if I do. As he pads into the dark of the wolf woods, I imagine a time here when the Tukudika (sheep-eater) Indians were the only residents of what is now Yellowstone Park. Their ancestors were here for 12,000 years. In the 1870s, they were finally driven from their land so that president Ulysses S Grant could declare the world's first national park open, free from its wolf-loving indigenous people and, within half a century, of the wolf itself. </p> <p>I'm not saying life here was all that great for the Tukudika people. The Crow, Blackfeet, Shoshone and Bannock passed through only in the summer, like today's Winnebago-ed, baseball-cap wearing tourists. No, this was the empire of the wolf, which it shared happily with eagles, bald and golden, ouzels, osprey, magpies, trumpeter swans and Canada geese, bison, badgers, wolverines, red foxes, coyotes, yellow-bellied marmosets, ground squirrels, elk, deer and raven. With icicle-hung spruce and whitebark pine (a favourite snack for grizzlies), sagebrush, buttercups and Old Faithful, and all those other geysers, blowing superheated steam high into the Rocky-fringed sky. </p> <p>He must have rejoined the pack. It's time for me to join humankind. The cold has bitten through to the bone marrow. Just as I stretch up to go, the howling starts again. A choir not of devils, or of things that go bump in the night, but of angels. A hymn to the universe. I'm not an American or a tree-hugger, so I can't join in the howling. But I can mouth these words, known since age seven: \"Every man who is pure in heart/and says his prayers at night/could become a wolf when the wolfsbane blooms/and when the autumn moon is bright\". Or these, from Jack London, learned a year later: \"And when, on the still cold night, he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and wolflike, it was his ancestors, dead and dust, pointing nose and star and howling down through the centuries and through him\". Through man and wolf and the wolf in us</p>",

Protected at long last alongside other predators bedevilled by farmers and wimps - mountain lions, grizzly bears and coyotes - the wolf has taken up its time-honoured place in the natural order of things, culling the weak, the old and the ill from herds of deer, elk and bison. And bringing epic poetry back into epic landscapes. Not once in my sub-zero trek across Yellowstone did I expect to be threatened by a wolf. I had written this quote from Edward Hoagland's Red Wolves And Black Bears in my notebook: \"We know that the folklore was exaggerated, that generally wolves don't attack man, which is a relief, but we treasure the stories nonetheless, wanting the woods to be woods.\" Dark woods, secret woods, woods where wolves might lurk and howl in competition with banshees. Woods where teddy bears would not be having a picnic today or any other day. I was brought up not to trust people who don't like dogs, and not simply because dogs are best friends and don't lie about love, but because the only nasty dogs I have ever met have been made so by the kind of human beings you wish a big bad wolf of legend would come and gobble up. But that would be a crime. As for the Yellowstone wolves, they've been on trial legally and scientifically for crimes that they may or may not have committed against sheep and cattle. The original Canadian settlers were fitted-up with radio collars to see if and where they would settle, and whether or not they would attack livestock. The radio collars fall off eventually and, as each season passes, the wolves are increasingly free to follow their own secret, richly scented lives, free, too, from the prying eyes of humankind. Just for now, though, some of us have sought the privilege of knowing roughly where the wolves are and - as far as this is possible with such a shy animal - to meet, if not going so far as to dine, with them. The only creatures who feel confident enough to do this are the ravens who help guide wolves to the kill; to sick animals, for the most part. The wolves do the killing with suddenness and lightning speed, and while they scythe through the bone and muscle of their prey, the ravens get to peck away at the side-orders and relishes. Unwelcome dinner guests may include the smaller coyote and, sometimes, the very much smaller fox; wolves, however, will attack and kill both of these in certain circumstances, as they will members of rival packs who stray into their clearly-marked territory and show no sign of leaving when threatened. It's best not to sup with a wolf, not least because it will make mincemeat of a dish that you couldn't begin to tackle without a chainsaw and a cookbook. A wolf's 42 extremely large teeth are ideally suited to slashing and cracking through heavy bones and dense muscle. Their jaws can exert a pressure of 1,500lbs per square inch, twice that of a large dog. Diner, beware. Especially the Red Riding Hoods among you. Red Riding Hood was, of course, the sexual innocent, who allowed herself to be devoured by the big bad wolf on a day, presumably, when he wasn't trying to huff and puff and blow the little pigs' house down. The wolf was said, in legend, to be sexually predatory, as well as unpredictable and treacherous. My dictionary defines \"wolf\", aside from the obvious, as \"a voracious, grabbing, or fiercely cruel person or thing \", and as \"a man who habitually tries to seduce women\". It reminds me that men \"wolf-whistle\" after women walking past scaffolding, that \"lupa\", the Latin and Italian for wolf, signifies a prostitute, that a wolf-note is \"an unpleasant sound produced in some notes played on the violin\", that to \"cry wolf\" is \"to give a false alarm\". There are so many bad connotations attached to the name \"wolf\" that we seem to have met with the devil himself. And, if we look through a translation of a 12th-century bestiary made by T H White, this is just what some our forbears thought: \"The devil bears the similitude of a wolf, he who is always looking over the human race with his evil eye and darkly prowling around the sheepfolds of the faithful so that he may afflict and ruin their souls... its eyes shine in the night like lamps because the works of the devil are everywhere thought to seem beautiful and salubrious...\" But the wolf is not a sexual predator. In fact, for 10 months out of 12, it is effectively celibate. Packs - usually around a dozen animals, but occasionally as many as three dozen - celebrate their sexuality over a two-month period between April and June, when they den and produce cubs that are much-loved not only by their parents but also by the pack. Wolves are devoted parents. Mothers are spoilt by the pack, which brings them not only food (much of it freshly regurgitated, liquidised, baby-food-style, for the cubs) but toys, too. Wolves are playful. They play games of tag, Frisbee with bones, tugs-of-war: all these doubtless help to develop hunting skills, but no one seeing wolves in the wild will ever doubt that they enjoy playing as much as humans do. The two teenage males that loped alongside me for several hundred yards as I ski'd, accelerated at one point into a sprint, their tales wrapped across one another's tawny flanks. They were having a ball in the fresh fall of snow. Wolves may or may not mate for life. During most of the year, however, they live contentedly with one another - although there are occasional squabbles and fallings-out when lone wolves leave to find new mates and adopt a new pack. The affection that wolves show one another is quite magical compared with much human behaviour. It is, of course, humans who are sexually predatory, and humans who have unloaded their fears and inadequacies on the wolf. Just as minority races have been blamed and persecuted for war, pestilence, famine, unemployment and general malaise, so too the innocent and good-natured wolf. The ruthlessness with which the wolf was driven from Europe and then much of North America between, say, 1450 and 1950 was extraordinary. And the way in which we could even damn the wolf's peerless song - calling an ugly note a \"wolf note\" - shows just how deep the gap between our disinfected lives and the natural order had grown. Only the most gifted musicians, the greatest singers can match the near unearthly beauty of wolves in full song. Unearthly, not because they are out of tune with nature - few animals are so well adapted to the many habitats they have been forced to survive in and enjoy - but because they sing at their best when the moon is full and on nights when the stars, especially Sirius, shine their brightest, which in Yellowstone - away from the smoke of two-stroke snowmobiles and the plumes of steam shot up to as much as 1,000ft by 300 or so geysers - is very bright indeed. The full moon is also the time when lunatics bay and lycanthropics howl into the night sky, when werewolves prowl, banshees wail, witches are abroad and vampires flutter under eaves, hoping for the jugular. There are genuine cases of lycanthropy, in which victims go on all fours, howl, desire raw meat and lacerate themselves, but these are far rarer than reports of werewolves. Werewolves were believed to exist not only in the mind of Peter Cushing's professors and puritans in Hammer horror films, but by the clergy and faithful of medieval Europe and after. The last religious study treating werewolves as dangerous fact was written by the clerical scholar Montague Summers in 1961. \"A werewolf,\" he wrote, \"is a human being, man, woman or child (more often the first) who either voluntarily or involuntarily changes or is metamorphosed into the apparent shape of a wolf, and who is then possessed of all the characteristics, the foul appetites, ferocity, cunning, the brute strength, and swiftness of that animal.\" Werewolfery, he suggested, is either hereditary or acquired, a horrible pleasure born of the thirst to quaff warm human blood. The beast's appetites were \"depraved beyond humanity\", its greatest desire was to rut bestially, offering \"foul sacrifice\" to the \"Monstrous Goat who sat upon the throne of worship and adoration\". The werewolf has been a popular theme in horror novels and films since the late 18th century. From Bram Stoker to the world of celluloid nightmares - The Howling, An American Werewolf In London and beyond - this fear of the wolf, of the wild in us that might suddenly kidnap our rational mind, continues to haunt our most gothic dreams. Yet the real horror has been active in the minds and expressed in the acts of those who have adopted the satanic view of the wolf without understanding anything of the mind of the altruistic animal they adopt as a symbol. Most notorious of these was Adolf Hitler. To his niece and lover, Geli Raubal, he was Herr Wolf. His eastern command headquarters in the Silesian forest was the Wolfsschanze (wolf's lair), from where German forces were ordered to commit many of their greatest atrocities. Beware the wolf that's foe to man. Hitler was affected by the Nordic legends in which wolves played major roles. Perhaps he identified with Fenris, the giant wolf of destruction whose sister Hel, goddess of the underworld, was bound for aeons - kept in waiting in Hitler's terms - by a magic rope spun by dwarves (imperial and Weimar politicians) until unleashed at G\u00f6tterdammerung, the twilight of the gods, when the sun and moon were devoured by wolf giants. Fenris swallowed Odin, chief of the gods, before himself being slain. The world was consumed by fire, but reborn to a new (and hopefully better) human race. Curiously, though, there are counter legends through history that tell of the noble nature of the wolf. The most famous of these is, of course, that of Romulus and Remus and the founding of Rome in 753BC. The twins were born the sons of the god of war, Mars, and Rhea Silva, daughter of Numitor, king of Alba Longa. Exposed to die, they were suckled by a she-wolf and discovered and then brought up by the husband-and-wife peasants, Faustulus and Acca Larentia. Perhaps they would have done better staying with the wolf. Or, at least Remus might have. As Cain slew Abel, Romulus slew Remus. Far from being punished, he went on to found Rome, and when he died in 716BC he ascended into heaven in a chariot of fire sent by Mars and drawn by wolves. He then became the god Quirinus. Not bad for a wolf-suckled murderer, but whoever said the gods were fair? And the wolf? Well, she was probably nothing more and nothing less than a good-hearted \"lupa\", a lady of the night who may or may not have howled at the moon. More touching is Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, in which Mowgli, the naked man-cub is adopted by a pack of wolves. \"'Is that a man's cub?' said Mother Wolf. 'I have never seen one. Bring it here.' A wolf accustomed to moving his own cubs can, if necessary, mouth an egg without breaking it, and though Father Wolf's jaws closed right on the child's back not a tooth even scratched the skin as he laid it down among the cubs.\" Kipling drew Mowgli from stories of feral children supposedly brought up by wolves. There have been several cases, all rather dubious, but in some of our dreams at least wolves, who are model parents, would be a lot more fun and very much more caring than all too many of their human counterparts. There's something else, though, something more important. The wolf, as I always knew and now know better from looking into the infinite depths of those amber eyes, not only shares a kindred intelligence with us, but teaches us that it is possible to live a lively, playful, fully engaged and thoughtful life in tune rather than detached from nature. Our claim, as humans, to be somehow superior to nature has always been specious. \"A mountain with a wolf on it stands a little higher,\" wrote Edward Hoagland. And it does, just as a great engineer can improve a landscape with a beautiful bridge, working with the sweep, the curve, the torso of the landscape and not against it. The image of the bridge shows that we can have our rational-scientific world and respect nature. The wolf on the mountain, out there in the Rockies, in the Apennines and Spanish Pyrenees, represents a state of natural grace that we do not know or cannot obtain, yet yearn for in our bones. A wildness that we beat away from ourselves by persecuting the wolf. It has been extraordinary to sense just how hostile or plain fearful so many people are when the words \"wolf\" and \"reintroduction\" are mentioned. Recent discussions about the possibility of wolves being re-released into the Scottish highlands have been hampered not just by local livestock owners, but by those who seem to imagine that a walk across the glens in some lupine future would mean ramblers being torn to pieces by wild dogs absurdly craving the e-number blood of hikers. Or that conservationists are about to clone Sue, the star American Tyrannosaurus rex and set her test-tube offspring clumping through the heather. A wolf would be all but invisible to man in the wilderness of the Highlands. More wild animals are killed by socially ambitious dimwits with guns in Scotland than a sustainable number of wolves ever could, even if they were greedy, which they are not, or stupid, which they aren't, either. Just the thought that the wolf was out there would be enough to make the Highlands, special as they are, feel that bit closer to Arcady. There are wolves in the distant provinces of Siberia, China and India. There are wolves, in fact, in small numbers hiding from human beings wherever they can, in the interstices of the belching, farting, besmirched and fouled world we smugly believe is better than that of the wolf, which is so light on its feet that the only mark it leaves of its passing is the gentlest imprints of its big paws in the Wyoming snow. I sit in the snow and watch my gray wolf ripple into the forest. I won't move until the cold is too much to bear because I want him to stay in view, to imprint himself on my mind's eye, for as long as possible. He'll run if I move, and as he can hear me up to six miles away, pick up my scent from at least two, he'll know if I do. As he pads into the dark of the wolf woods, I imagine a time here when the Tukudika (sheep-eater) Indians were the only residents of what is now Yellowstone Park. Their ancestors were here for 12,000 years. In the 1870s, they were finally driven from their land so that president Ulysses S Grant could declare the world's first national park open, free from its wolf-loving indigenous people and, within half a century, of the wolf itself. I'm not saying life here was all that great for the Tukudika people. The Crow, Blackfeet, Shoshone and Bannock passed through only in the summer, like today's Winnebago-ed, baseball-cap wearing tourists. No, this was the empire of the wolf, which it shared happily with eagles, bald and golden, ouzels, osprey, magpies, trumpeter swans and Canada geese, bison, badgers, wolverines, red foxes, coyotes, yellow-bellied marmosets, ground squirrels, elk, deer and raven. With icicle-hung spruce and whitebark pine (a favourite snack for grizzlies), sagebrush, buttercups and Old Faithful, and all those other geysers, blowing superheated steam high into the Rocky-fringed sky. He must have rejoined the pack. It's time for me to join humankind. The cold has bitten through to the bone marrow. Just as I stretch up to go, the howling starts again. A choir not of devils, or of things that go bump in the night, but of angels. A hymn to the universe. I'm not an American or a tree-hugger, so I can't join in the howling. But I can mouth these words, known since age seven: \"Every man who is pure in heart/and says his prayers at night/could become a wolf when the wolfsbane blooms/and when the autumn moon is bright\". Or these, from Jack London, learned a year later: \"And when, on the still cold night, he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and wolflike, it was his ancestors, dead and dust, pointing nose and star and howling down through the centuries and through him\". Through man and wolf and the wolf in us",

Sometimes multiple page submissions get separated. This will ensure that if your CV is misplaced, the employer will have backup information regarding your address and telephone number. </p> <p>2) Address the letter to a specific person, and include their title. Finding a personal contact in the company is crucial to your chances of success - a person to write to rather than just addressing the letter to the employment department. Generic job letters suggest you have very little interest in the organisation or its needs. </p> <p>Some personnel officers receive up to 10,000 CVs in a year, so the least you can do is take the time to call the company and find out what their names is. Personnel managers admit that sometimes it's best to send a copy of your CV and cover letter to the manager of the position you are interested in. It's likely this person will have some say, if not the final say regarding whether you are considered, and ultimately hired. </p> <p>3) List the title of the job and how you learned about it in the introductory paragraph. If you were referred by someone, use their name. If you don't know anything about the positions the company has to offer, the best thing you can do is ask to learn something about them. You'll come across a lot more positively than those people simply asking for jobs. </p> <p>4) Be positive. \"Put yourself in the position of the recruiter who receives hundreds of speculative letters every week,\" says Simon Howard, author of Creating a successful CV (Dorling Kindersley). \"Try opening your letter with a positive statement. In order to get the reader's attention, it can be a good ploy to start with 'you' or 'your'. For example, 'Your company has an impressive reputation in the field of...' or 'You are one of a very few employers...'. The letter needs to describe the key aspects of your CV succintly and say why the recruiter should be interested in you. You must make a clear proposition and leave the reader in no doubt of your career objective.\" </p> <p>5) In the body paragraphs, let the person know you've researched their company and use bullet statements to prove you have what it takes to do the specific job they have available. </p> <p>6) Write in your own words. Make sure that your letter sounds like you, not like something out of a book. Your covering letter should be an accurate reflection of your personality. Employers are looking for knowledge, enthusiasm, and focus. </p> <p>7) Keep it short. Keep it simple and clean - not cluttered. Use no more than seven lines, and preferably five or fewer, per paragraph. Vary the sentence length. None of the sentences should be very long, but you don't want a staccato stream of very short sentences. One page is the maximum for letters. </p> <p>8) Close with a courteous 'thank you', but include a statement which leaves you open for a follow-up by phone. </p> <p>9) If you can't find any information about the company, the next best thing to do is ask for it. Requesting an in-house newsletter or annual report shows sincerity and interest. </p> <p>10) Proofread your letter for errors and tone before you send it.

And for those who decide not to join, at least they will always have the option. </p> <p>But is it better to join the family business straight from university? After all, if you're sure that's what you want, why waste time working elsewhere? Or is it better to get work experience in the big wide world first? </p> <p>Working in her father's manufacturing company during the school holidays and at weekends convinced Satbir Billen that she did not want to go into the family business. \"I enjoyed working there but I saw the hard work that was needed, the long, unsociable hours, the setbacks and the stress.

Satbir's views about working in the family business have changed since working in PR. </p> <p>\"I realised that to be successful in your career, even if you're working for somebody else, you still have to work the long hours and deal with stress. That's when I started to re-think my views about working for yourself: at least my father has reaped the rewards from being his own boss,\" she adds. </p> <p>\"My brother, Jatinder Singh Bhaura, joined the family business straight from university but he decided to leave after two and a half years.

      "body": "<br> <b>Address: </b>Levant, London <br> Something was most definitely up. The place was awash with critics, chefs, distinguished food writers and chroniclers of the social scene. Why, even I was in the company of Blossom, the distinguished restaurant commentator of our sister newspaper, The Observer, his wife, my wife, and two immensely informed eaters from America. I began to wonder if there was anyone dining in Levant that night who was what you might call a non-interested party. We all sat at our tables, wondering how the others were getting on, and how they'd express their experience in print. <p>The last time I had been to Levant, it hadn't been Levant at all, but Oceana, a restaurant of some ambition, style and substance that never quite hacked it in the public affections. That was then. Levant is now. The basement area has been modified, simplified and made immeasurably sophisticated and elegant. The London passion for things North African has moved on from the colour, swirl and dash of the carpet stalls of the souk to something more reminiscent of the austere beauty of the desert itself. </p> <p>Food, too, has moved on (if those are the words), to what is claimed is a kind of modified Middle Eastern cooking - the Levant is defined generally as \"the eastern Mediterranean and its shores\" (Chambers). The chef is definitely British. Having said that, the breads, pickles, moutabal, taramasalata, muhammra and the hummus, which were delivered to our table by a young man of rare charm, could have been distinctly and deliciously straight from a table in Jerusalem. </p> <p>From there on in it would seem the level of direct inspiration seemed to fluctuate. Clearly, the intention is not to produce \"authentic\" food of the Levant, which is just as well, as I am not in a position to comment learnedly on matters of authenticity. My grilled sardines, for example, could as well have been multi-purpose Mediterranean as from the coast between Tizi Ouzou and Beirut. They were as large as small herrings and notably well-cooked, but not remotely nationalised by any one culinary culture. </p> <p>Being six around the table, we gave the menu a pretty good run-through - some squid, coated, the menu said, in almonds, a nice conceit I thought; a ravioli lookalike called manti stuffed with chard and feta; braised spiced lamb with potatoes and chickpeas; roasted sea bass with red pepper and walnut sauce; a poussin ditto; roast kid; lamb kebab; spinach salad; rocket salad; and then, in the pudding department baklava, lemon semolina cake, almond-stuffed dates with clotted cream, and poached dried fruits with vanilla ice cream. </p> <p>I'd better say right off that it was a fairly disappointing experience, all told. It wasn't that the food was bad, or even badly cooked, but it lacked oomph, it lacked zip and zest, and, above all, it lacked spice. Spice, it seems to me, lies at the heart of Middle Eastern cooking: the dextrous use of turmeric, cumin, cinnamon, saffron, coriander, chilli and all the rest are, in many cases, what distinguishes the Lebanese version of a dish from the Syrian, or the Syrian from the Moroccan. Of the pointed, piquant use of spice there was no trace as far as I was concerned. It may be said, with some fairness, that I was beginning to show the symptoms of the Mother of All Colds, but I patiently questioned my fellows at the table, all of whom have more sensitive palates than I anyway, and they were equally baffled on the spice front. </p> <p>I have no particular beef with the reinvention of the cooking of whatever country, just so long as the finished article cries \"Eat me!\" in a commanding fashion. The food at Levant did not. For instance, my stew of lamb and chickpeas was a pleasant enough proto-peasant stew, but without distinguishing characteristics. The sea bream and the grilled poussin came in for a similar low level of enthusiasm. The manti were decent enough, but the pasta envelope was of the heavy-duty variety. </p> <p>While some dishes could have done with a touch more of the warm south, others could have done with less. If you are going to make a virtue of non-authenticity, then you have the excuse to trim a little fat off the roast kid. Obviously, if you are beside a wadi in the desert such refinements of butchery may get overlooked. You're not going to waste a good chunk of nice, wholesome fat under those circumstances. In Marylebone, London, it is another matter, however. The amount of fat was excessive. (To be fair, the majestic Jonathan Meades, dining at another table, embraced the notion of fat wholeheartedly. The kid had been fatty, he agreed, \"but it was very good fat\".) And the blanched spinach salad with pine kernels was simply inedible - bitter, claggy and beastly. </p> <p>The puddings were greeted with a little more praise, and so they should be, but they weren't enough in themselves to restore the sense of well-being that good dining should generate. This sense of blighted hope was intensified by a bill that reached \u00a3293, but it turned out that that was all our own fault. Two bottles of imperious Chteau Musar at \u00a328.50 each, two bottles of an impish Cassis at \u00a326.00 each, plus another \u00a335 on sundry other tipples before and during meant that booze accounted for roughly half the bill - \u00a3144.50 (and before you get huffy about the sum spent on that front, I'd remind you that we were entertaining eminent guests). So that left \u00a3148.86 on food, or a shade under \u00a325 a head, which isn't nearly as bad as the original total suggests. Indeed, by London standards, it would be more than reasonable if only the food had been as assured and as soothing as the service and decor.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A cabinet battle has broken out over tactics in the coming spending review with some ministers furious that their colleagues are briefing that public services are to receive a multibillion boost.</p> <p>They have been exasperated by headlines this week proclaiming that overall spending will rise by \u00a340bn in the third year, while capital spending on transport could rise by as much as \u00a3140bn over 10 years.</p> <p>Some ministers believe the public is now cynical about government promises of extra cash and privately warned yesterday that disillusionment with Labour will only deepen if ministers raise expectations of huge increases in next month's three-year spending review. They say that previous tactics of accumulating annual rises in order to arrive at an artificially boosted total had backfired.</p> <p>\"We are now doing the exact opposite of what we agreed we would do, which was to talk about money for investment,\" said one minister.</p> <p>Anger is being directed at the chancellor Gordon Brown with critics claiming he is playing a very hard game in private while letting his team brief that he will permit big spending increases in the third year of the spending review.</p> <p>There is special tension developing between the industry secretary Stephen Byers and Mr Brown.</p> <p>It is understood that the chancellor, already at odds with Mr Byers over the single currency and the minimum wage, has rejected the Department of Trade and Industry's spending bid.</p> <p>Mr Byers, after a difficult two months, is seeking a political rehabilitation, but is said to be angered at his treatment by the chancellor.</p> <p>Tensions are also rising over the bids being tabled by the education secretary David Blunkett for higher education spending.</p> <p>Although it is expected that education will get big overall rises in 2003-4, the third year of the spending review period, education officials are warning that ministers plan to cut the amount of money given for each university student by up to 3% - although the total is likely to rise because of the increase in the number of students. Any cut in spending per student would represent a substantial worsening of the present position.</p> <p>The Treasury is insisting such cuts are necessary to take account of the overall expansion of places. The government has set a target of an extra 100,000 students in higher education, including many more mature students.</p> <p>It is also understood that the Home Office is still battling to get a big enough rise to accommodate an increase in police numbers. One cabinet minister said yesterday: \"The review was supposed to be about modernisation and investment, but all the headlines are about telephone number spending increases. We need to dampen down expectations. People are not in the mood to hear about these kinds of numbers. We are in danger of forgetting every lesson we learnt from the previous spending review\".</p> <p>Briefing on figures is believed to be coming from both the Treasury and from ministers eager to proclaim their personal triumphs in their negotiations with the Treasury.</p> <p>It is understood that Mr Byers is taking a special interest in the presentation of the figures in the spending review. He and other modernisers are determined to ensure they are presented in the traditional annualised form, rather than accumulated year on year to give an unduly bloated figure.</p> <p>Mr Byers' officials say he has been told that in the previous spending review in 1998, Mr Blunkett, the then health secretary Frank Dobson and some Treasury civil servants protested over the presentation of \u00a340bn increases for health and education. The Treasury reached this figure by accumulating each annual rise.</p> <p>In retrospect, ministers regard the presentation as superficially attractive, but in the long term counter-productive since they raised expectations that have not subsequently been met.</p> <p>Some of the briefing reflects long standing personal tensions within the cabinet over Mr Brown's style and his determination to keep the Treasury in control of events. But it also reveals real tensions over the distribution of spending.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor Michael Portillo moved yesterday to capitalise on the latest headlines of big spending increases saying the government had lost the benefit of the doubt about these big spending increases.</p> <p>He said in a speech in Basildon: \"Less than a year and a half ago, the very same Labour ministers toured the very same television studios to talk about \u00a321bn and \u00a319bn which the first spending review would pour into health and education.</p> <p>\"It is because all these claims proved to be just hype the first time round that the same trick won't work again. If Labour can parade all this extra money, and expect people to be pathetically grateful, they demonstrate just out of touch they are.\"</p>",

They say that previous tactics of accumulating annual rises in order to arrive at an artificially boosted total had backfired. \"We are now doing the exact opposite of what we agreed we would do, which was to talk about money for investment,\" said one minister. Anger is being directed at the chancellor Gordon Brown with critics claiming he is playing a very hard game in private while letting his team brief that he will permit big spending increases in the third year of the spending review. There is special tension developing between the industry secretary Stephen Byers and Mr Brown. It is understood that the chancellor, already at odds with Mr Byers over the single currency and the minimum wage, has rejected the Department of Trade and Industry's spending bid. Mr Byers, after a difficult two months, is seeking a political rehabilitation, but is said to be angered at his treatment by the chancellor. Tensions are also rising over the bids being tabled by the education secretary David Blunkett for higher education spending. Although it is expected that education will get big overall rises in 2003-4, the third year of the spending review period, education officials are warning that ministers plan to cut the amount of money given for each university student by up to 3% - although the total is likely to rise because of the increase in the number of students. Any cut in spending per student would represent a substantial worsening of the present position. The Treasury is insisting such cuts are necessary to take account of the overall expansion of places. The government has set a target of an extra 100,000 students in higher education, including many more mature students. It is also understood that the Home Office is still battling to get a big enough rise to accommodate an increase in police numbers. One cabinet minister said yesterday: \"The review was supposed to be about modernisation and investment, but all the headlines are about telephone number spending increases. We need to dampen down expectations. People are not in the mood to hear about these kinds of numbers. We are in danger of forgetting every lesson we learnt from the previous spending review\". Briefing on figures is believed to be coming from both the Treasury and from ministers eager to proclaim their personal triumphs in their negotiations with the Treasury. It is understood that Mr Byers is taking a special interest in the presentation of the figures in the spending review. He and other modernisers are determined to ensure they are presented in the traditional annualised form, rather than accumulated year on year to give an unduly bloated figure. Mr Byers' officials say he has been told that in the previous spending review in 1998, Mr Blunkett, the then health secretary Frank Dobson and some Treasury civil servants protested over the presentation of \u00a340bn increases for health and education. The Treasury reached this figure by accumulating each annual rise. In retrospect, ministers regard the presentation as superficially attractive, but in the long term counter-productive since they raised expectations that have not subsequently been met. Some of the briefing reflects long standing personal tensions within the cabinet over Mr Brown's style and his determination to keep the Treasury in control of events. But it also reveals real tensions over the distribution of spending. The shadow chancellor Michael Portillo moved yesterday to capitalise on the latest headlines of big spending increases saying the government had lost the benefit of the doubt about these big spending increases. He said in a speech in Basildon: \"Less than a year and a half ago, the very same Labour ministers toured the very same television studios to talk about \u00a321bn and \u00a319bn which the first spending review would pour into health and education. \"It is because all these claims proved to be just hype the first time round that the same trick won't work again. If Labour can parade all this extra money, and expect people to be pathetically grateful, they demonstrate just out of touch they are.\"",

A report to be considered by the Methodists' annual conference in Huddersfield this month will ask them to banish the image of sex offenders as men in dirty macs and instead offer a role in the church to them and their families. In some circumstances, the report suggests informing only a select few churchgoers of a sex offender's identity - keeping it secret from the main congregation. The report says: \"What does the sex offender need? Acceptance, love, a place to worship and join in fellowship, comrades for the journey, and people who accept him as he is and commit themselves to supporting him in his attempt to live a new life.\" The church's working party which drew up the report suggests that although former offenders should not expect unconditional forgiveness or be allowed to hold any church office, they should be accepted and treated with respect. The move is likely to stir controversy at a time when paedophiles are in some cases hounded out of communities. The report says: \"Given the tendency on the part of the media to demonise paedophiles and make it very difficult for sex offenders to rebuild their lives ... we believe that the church has a significant role to play in offering them and their families pastoral support, to encourage their responsible involvement in church and society.\" It suggests offenders should be made known to a select and discreet group within any chapel, and be encouraged to pray and seek divine forgiveness. The working group chairman is Dick Jones, a minister in Nottingham and former president of the Methodist Conference. He said: \"We were concerned to get away from the idea that these are peculiar people in dirty macs. These are probably the most extensive guidelines drawn up by any church.\" In a survey of ministers, the working party found nearly one in five knew of sex offenders within their churches at some stage of their ministry - a proportion which the report says may well be an underestimate. Some 13% of ministers said they were aware of offenders in their current appointment, rising to 25 % in North Wales and 20% in north-west London. A Home Office study in 1995 suggested that 10% of sex offenders are convicted of a similar offence within five years and 22% are convicted of either a sexual or violent offence within the same period. The report suggests that a quarter of sex offenders attend church regularly, compared with 8% of the population as a whole.

      "body": "<p>It is 1944. Esther Mossel is walking with her father, holding his hand high above her head. She is six years old. There are many people lying about. They are all naked. She asks him, \"Why are they sunbathing?\" </p> <p>Her elder sister had been a sickly child, and long before they were sent to Bergen-Belsen, Esther could remember her lying bare under a sun-ray lamp, to get well again. </p> <p> Esther's father, Joseph, known as Yo, was a schoolmaster in Alkmaar, near the Dutch village of Heiloo where they lived. Her mother, Else, had trained as a lawyer. Esther's brother Ben was nine years older than her; her sister Yett seven years older. Yo and Else were Zionists and had set up the Jewish Kehila, or community, in Alkmaar. They were well-respected there. Hitler invaded Holland between May 10 and May 15, 1940 and the Mossels tried to escape at once to England. But the ports were already closed and they were forbidden to leave. With the co-operation of the Dutch police, the Germans had access to all registration - births, marriages, deaths, the electoral roll - so that every Jewish family could be easily located. A total of 105,000 Dutch Jews died in the Holocaust. </p> <p>Later that year, Jewish government employees and schoolteachers were stripped of their posts. Then Jewish children had to leave the state schools. For a year, Yo taught his son Ben, and Ben's friend Marjan Drukker, at home. On May 3 1942 came the edict forcing all Jews to wear the Star of David and, shortly after, all Dutch Jews were ordered to move to Amsterdam. </p> <p>The Mossels were fortunate enough to have an aunt there. They took one floor of her large house, Plantage Middellaan 3, opposite the Schouwburg Theatre. The Hortis and Artis (the botanical gardens, and the zoo) were just round the corner. It should have been a good place for children - if all public amenities had not been closed to the Jews. And the Schouwburg had turned into a collection-point as they were rounded up. </p> <p>The enforced displacement of the Jews to Amsterdam undid much of the accurate registration the German occupation had inherited. Although officially now concentrated in the city, it was possible for many families to go into hiding in rural Holland, or to foster their younger children in Aryan families. The Mossel's maid, Annie Duyfetter, remembers Esther being left with her in the country. Esther always insisted on wearing a hat: her parents must have impressed on her that she shouldn't uncover her head - her dark hair could have given her away among the predominantly blonde rural Dutch. </p> <p>One day she and Annie were crossing a bridge when the wife of a local Nazi collaborator stopped them, saying: \"I know you have a Jewish child in your house.\" Annie firmly claimed the little girl by her side was her niece from the south of Holland, but soon Esther was sent back to her parents. </p> <p>Fostering was perilous for both children and hosts. Marjan Drukker, Ben's friend, who had studied with Yo the year before, went into hiding with her parents. They were taken in by a Dutch farmer, Piet Kleibroek, of Warmenhuizen. They were betrayed and not one of either family survived. </p> <p>The Resistance placed each member of the family with a different host. Meyer, Yo's youngest brother, was taken in by watchmaker Kasperten Boom, 77, a devout Christian, in Haarlem. Meyer was hidden with his family in Ten Boom's watch shop at Barteljorisstraat 19, from May 1943 till February 1944, when they too were betrayed. Meyer and some of the others managed to stay hidden in an attic and after three days were moved to Friesland. Ten Boom died after two weeks' interrogation. His two daughters were sent to concentration camps: only one survived. </p> <p>Many children were moved from home to home secretly, by night. There are records of children passing through up to 26 hiding places. (After the war, legal battles were fought over 1,854 children; 1,540 were returned to single surviving parents; 87 were given to guardians; 365 children were never returned to their surviving Jewish families.) </p> <p>When the Mossels arrived in Amsterdam in May 1942, Yo began teaching maths at a school set up by the Jewish Council. It was a sad school because the children kept disappearing - a few into hiding, the vast majority to the camps. The streets were being cleared house by house. Informers were paid 6 or 7 guilders a head - about \u00a350 today. </p> <p>By the end of October, Yo's third brother Aaron, with his wife and their children, had also been rounded up. His second brother Jacques, with his wife and three children, was gone by the spring of 1943. On May 26 1943, the bell rang at Plantage Middellaan 3 for an insolently long time. Yo opened the door. A Dutch civilian in a brown suit and two Dutch policemen were standing there. They came in and sat down at the table while the family collected their belongings together. They had already packed. Esther remembers being dressed in multiple layers of clothing. She does not remember being frightened. </p> <p>They were deported by train to Westerbork, which had originally been established by the Dutch in 1938 as a reception camp for Jewish refugees from Germany. Conditions were relatively good, if crowded. By the beginning of 1942 there were some 1,600 prisoners. By the end of the year more barracks were built to house another 10,000 Jews and Gypsies. </p> <p>The camp was well-organised. There was a theatre, where Jewish artistes performed for the benefit of captors and prisoners. There was a social life. The children were kept busy - Esther remembers making origami and singing Jewish songs in a children's choir. Yo taught Hebrew, even though it was forbidden. </p> <p>Every Monday, a list of names would be read out, of those to be deported by train the following day for unknown destinations in the east. There was an atmosphere of dread. The whole week centred on the Monday roll-call: no-one wanted to leave. 107,000 Jewish prisoners were deported from Westerbork between July 1942 and April 1945, chiefly to Sobibor and Auschwitz. 5,000 survived. </p> <p>THE Mossels' turn came on January 11, 1944, when they were sent with 1,032 other Jews to Bergen-Belsen. It had been in operation since March 1943. Supposedly a preferential camp, the prisoners were not initially made to work, and forced labour was only partially introduced from 1944. The camp was divided into separate sections, including one for the Dutch - the Sternlager, in which prisoners wore their own clothes with the Star of David. This also contained an Infectiebarak, or isolation hospital, set behind barbed wire, which was run by Dr Siegfried Emmering (a survivor of the camps who lived to his nineties). Here Esther's sister Yett spent most of her time ill with tuberculosis. Jewish prisoners served as nurses in the hospital. They probably had no medicine, but slightly better food and cleaner conditions. </p> <p>Yo's brother Zadok, with his wife and two daughters, had also come from Westerbork by the same train, as did Joshua Birnbaum and his wife, Hennie, and six children. At Westerbork, Joshua had created an orphanage. In Bergen-Belsen, Esther was often looked after by the Birnbaums - she remembers them shaving off her hair to get rid of the ubiquitous lice, and burning her infested clothes. </p> <p>She also remembers having a brown coat, a small blue blanket which was her comforter, and a little bag in which she kept her belongings. Among these was a cotton-reel with which she did French knitting, using wool the grown-ups unravelled from worn-out clothes. She made yarmulkes (the Jewish skull-cap), and plaited reins to play at horses with the other children. </p> <p> Esther has a vivid memory of a group of very religious young Tunisian boys with peyess (the ritually uncut sidelocks). The children would refuse to eat camp food that was not kosher. That left them little but bread and water. They used to walk round the camp singing a song of rejoicing, so constantly that Esther can sing it to this day. They died of starvation very quickly. </p> <p>She remembers the long hours spent in appel [roll-call] in lines of five, being counted by the guards. Some were kind but others were brutal, particularly a woman guard nicknamed De Griet, who used to beat the prisoners viciously. One witness records her attacking Ben. Once when Else flung out some dirty water from cleaning the barrack, she was caught by De Griet and thrown into the bunker - thick walled, concrete, and very cold - for three days without food or water. At the end of that time Esther remembers others pointing Else out, telling her, \"That's your mother\". Esther couldn't get near. She was very sad for her - she looked so far away, like a person already in another world. </p> <p>Towards the end of the war conditions deteriorated fast as Bergen-Belsen received thousands of prisoners from other concentration camps. Between December 1944 and March 1945, when the Germans retreated, the camp population rose from 15,000 to 41,000. About 50,000 concentration camp prisoners and 30-50,000 prisoners of war died in Bergen-Belsen, of whom 35,000 died from starvation, epidemics and exhaustion in the camp's last months between January and April 1945. </p> <p>In 1945 the feast of Passover came unusually early, on March 29. Esther was at that time quartered with the Birnbaum family, who secretly baked Matzos and told her about the liberation of Jews from Egyptian slavery. Less than a week later, Esther stood by her mother's bedside on the lowest bunk. Else was very weak and thin. Esther remembers her skin hanging from her legs. Ben was standing by his mother's head, Yett at her feet. Ben said, \"Does Esther know?\" </p> <p>It was then that Esther learned her father had died on the first day of Pesach. That moment also proved to be the children's leave-taking from their mother. The next day the children and another 2,000 prisoners were put on a train at Celle. The adults had little doubt they were being taken to be exterminated. Those too ill to move, like Else Mossel, were left in the camp. </p> <p>For 13 days the train shuttled south and north between the German defence and the closing pincers of the Russian and Allied fronts. The train came to be known to the Dutch as De Dodentrein, the train of the dead. Between April 10 and April 22 alone, 139 died - many of the bodies were buried by the side of the railway tracks. Esther's childish memories, however, are very different. At Celle station she was re-united with her sister in a wagon set aside for the sick. There were seats and it was not as overcrowded as the rest of the train. She could lie and sleep. Out of the window above her she could see trees. </p> <p>There were many air-raids. Lying on the railway-embankment beside a young German soldier, she was surprised to see how pale and frightened he was. And one early morning, she remembers a man standing in the wagon doorway with a beautiful live cockerel in his arms. Later that day the Russians found them. It was April 25, 1945. They were not far from the village of Tr\u00f6bitz. </p> <p>Another 28 dead were taken out of the train and in Tr\u00f6bitz they continued to die. But for Esther it is a time of happy memories. Oom Zadok and Tante Annie, Yo's brother and wife, were there with their two children. Together with Ben and Yettie they lived in a house that had one German woman upstairs. Annie begged three matches, failed to light the large stove with one, succeeded with the second, and kept it burning till their departure many months later. </p> <p>She found a block of compressed tea in the larder and used it for barter. There was rhubarb growing in the fields which she cooked with rations of sweetened milk. They all made themselves sick with a tin of greasy meat from the larder. The children ran wild. Ben stole the Russian commandant's bicycle, and from a tree overlooking the bedroom watched a Russian soldier making love to the woman upstairs. Esther gorged herself on unripe fruit. Her seventh birthday was on July 24. Her aunt made a cake with the letter E in blackberries from the hedgerows of Tr\u00f6bitz. At the end of August the Russians transported two truckloads of Dutch survivors home. Annie still had her third match with her.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is 1944. Esther Mossel is walking with her father, holding his hand high above her head. She is six years old. There are many people lying about. They are all naked. She asks him, \"Why are they sunbathing?\" Her elder sister had been a sickly child, and long before they were sent to Bergen-Belsen, Esther could remember her lying bare under a sun-ray lamp, to get well again. Esther's father, Joseph, known as Yo, was a schoolmaster in Alkmaar, near the Dutch village of Heiloo where they lived. Her mother, Else, had trained as a lawyer. Esther's brother Ben was nine years older than her; her sister Yett seven years older. Yo and Else were Zionists and had set up the Jewish Kehila, or community, in Alkmaar. They were well-respected there. Hitler invaded Holland between May 10 and May 15, 1940 and the Mossels tried to escape at once to England. But the ports were already closed and they were forbidden to leave. With the co-operation of the Dutch police, the Germans had access to all registration - births, marriages, deaths, the electoral roll - so that every Jewish family could be easily located. A total of 105,000 Dutch Jews died in the Holocaust. Later that year, Jewish government employees and schoolteachers were stripped of their posts. Then Jewish children had to leave the state schools. For a year, Yo taught his son Ben, and Ben's friend Marjan Drukker, at home. On May 3 1942 came the edict forcing all Jews to wear the Star of David and, shortly after, all Dutch Jews were ordered to move to Amsterdam. The Mossels were fortunate enough to have an aunt there. They took one floor of her large house, Plantage Middellaan 3, opposite the Schouwburg Theatre. The Hortis and Artis (the botanical gardens, and the zoo) were just round the corner. It should have been a good place for children - if all public amenities had not been closed to the Jews. And the Schouwburg had turned into a collection-point as they were rounded up. The enforced displacement of the Jews to Amsterdam undid much of the accurate registration the German occupation had inherited. Although officially now concentrated in the city, it was possible for many families to go into hiding in rural Holland, or to foster their younger children in Aryan families. The Mossel's maid, Annie Duyfetter, remembers Esther being left with her in the country. Esther always insisted on wearing a hat: her parents must have impressed on her that she shouldn't uncover her head - her dark hair could have given her away among the predominantly blonde rural Dutch. One day she and Annie were crossing a bridge when the wife of a local Nazi collaborator stopped them, saying: \"I know you have a Jewish child in your house.\" Annie firmly claimed the little girl by her side was her niece from the south of Holland, but soon Esther was sent back to her parents. Fostering was perilous for both children and hosts. Marjan Drukker, Ben's friend, who had studied with Yo the year before, went into hiding with her parents. They were taken in by a Dutch farmer, Piet Kleibroek, of Warmenhuizen. They were betrayed and not one of either family survived. The Resistance placed each member of the family with a different host. Meyer, Yo's youngest brother, was taken in by watchmaker Kasperten Boom, 77, a devout Christian, in Haarlem. Meyer was hidden with his family in Ten Boom's watch shop at Barteljorisstraat 19, from May 1943 till February 1944, when they too were betrayed. Meyer and some of the others managed to stay hidden in an attic and after three days were moved to Friesland. Ten Boom died after two weeks' interrogation. His two daughters were sent to concentration camps: only one survived. Many children were moved from home to home secretly, by night. There are records of children passing through up to 26 hiding places. (After the war, legal battles were fought over 1,854 children; 1,540 were returned to single surviving parents; 87 were given to guardians; 365 children were never returned to their surviving Jewish families.) When the Mossels arrived in Amsterdam in May 1942, Yo began teaching maths at a school set up by the Jewish Council. It was a sad school because the children kept disappearing - a few into hiding, the vast majority to the camps. The streets were being cleared house by house. Informers were paid 6 or 7 guilders a head - about \u00a350 today. By the end of October, Yo's third brother Aaron, with his wife and their children, had also been rounded up. His second brother Jacques, with his wife and three children, was gone by the spring of 1943. On May 26 1943, the bell rang at Plantage Middellaan 3 for an insolently long time. Yo opened the door.

A police spokesman said they were simply enforcing the permit regime, intended to stop the entry of potential terrorists to Israel. But three Gazans who arrived at the beach with permits yesterday were brusquely told to leave the busier sections patronised by Jews and swim in the rocky and rubbish-encrusted bay near the twin city of Jaffa, which has an Arab majority. And off they meekly went. Other Palestinians do not leave so easily. In a strange game of beach roulette, some of the people arrested yesterday said they had been thrown out earlier but were determined to keep on coming. \"They said it was illegal for us to come here,\" said Firas, a computer science student at al-Quds University in Jerusalem. Arriving with seven friends in matching New York Yankee baseball caps, they were arrested near the dolphinarium before they could even set foot on the sand. \"But this is so unfair. The Israelis come to Jericho, they come to Ramallah, they come to Nablus. Nobody stops them. But we cannot go to the beach.\"",

The alert came as a bomb threat was phoned in to City of London police, causing the evacuation of offices in the Bishopsgate area of the financial district and the closure of Liverpool Street station for three hours. The call was a hoax but caused disturbance to businesses and commuters and traffic congestion. As officers from Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch began analysing debris from the high explosive device planted under Hammersmith Bridge, it emerged that ministers have assumed that a London-based cell of the Real IRA has been established. Ministers and security sources do not believe that the cell yet has the capacity to create serious damage in the capital but they do believe that the Real IRA is working closely with the Continuity IRA. While the two splinter groups number no more than 100 members and political supporters, it is believed they have the capacity to cause disruption. The groups are not believed to have the ability to create long-term physical damage either to the capital or the peace process. Ministers accept, however, that one strike such as that at Hammersmith Bridge will give the dissident republicans the political and military credibility to cause \"real chaos\" through further false alarms and bomb hoaxes. The blast on Hammersmith Bridge triggered a number of hoax calls including warnings that a device had been planted in the Dartford Tunnel in Kent, a part of the M25 orbital motorway, causing it to be closed for 35 minutes. \"There will be a lot of phone calls and warnings designed to cause maximum damage,\" the source said, adding that this could happen for weeks.

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, the head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said: \"I ask people that if they see a suspect package, to contact us on 999.\" He added there would be more high visibility policing in London in the wake of the bomb.

Hammersmith Bridge has been targeted twice before by terrorists, most recently in 1996 when the most powerful Semtex bomb ever used by the IRA on the mainland failed to go off. Tracking down the supposed new British-based cell will, according to sources, depend on the ability of the British security services and the Garda to inflitrate the dissident republican group and on the ability of the group itself to recruit from outside the known pool of sympathisers.

Well-placed sources within both companies suggested that merger talks were on, confirming developments on both sides of the Atlantic. The reports started in Minneapolis, headquarters of Northwest, although both companies would neither confirm nor deny the reports involving talks between Don Carty, chief executive of American, and John Dasburg, chief executive of Northwest. The story began to emerge after analysts said that they expected a new grouping following the announcement of the buy-out of US Airways last week by United Airlines, the world's largest airline. Shares in Northwest were up 20%, while American's fell by $1 to just over $28. Greg Overman, spokesman for the Allied Pilots' Associattion, said that an American Airlines board meeting had taken place this week, but a possible deal had not been mentioned. As well as flying to more than 150 cities worldwide, Northwest owns 13.5% of Continental, a small rival. American serves 180 cities overseas and has an extensive alliance with KLM, the Dutch carrier. Once United set its sights on US Airways, analysts had been waiting for a round of consolidation in the industry. In addition to a Northwest-American deal, analysts said a merger between Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines might be a marriage waiting to happen. A deal between Northwest and Texas-based American could face a host of obstacles, similar to those that may block the deal between United and US Airways, namely combining their workforces and their huge information technology networks. For the deal to get regulatory approval, Northwest would also have to sell off its 13.5% equity holding and 51% voting stake in Continental. The American Airlines-Northwest deal could have implications for British Airways which has been trying unsuccessfully to forge a link with AA for the past four years. Bob Ayling, BA's recently sacked chief executive, spent a large part of his career at BA attempting to bring about the deal. But both he and Mr Carty were thwarted by other large American carriers and by the regulatory authorities in both the UK and America. BA now has a new chief executive in Rod Eddington, who is trying to strengthen its operational base. Relations between BA and American Airlines remain cordial, but BA is concentrating on a link up closer to home. It is talking with KLM, in a move which would make it the biggest national carrier in Europe, providing it with a dual base at Heathrow and Schipol, near Amsterdam. Air France and the Spanish national carrier, Iberia, are also said to be involved in closer links. BA has a small stake in Iberia, showing the gradual interlocking of many of the large airlines.",

      "body": "<p>Hundreds of Zimbabwe's white farmers prepared to leave their land yesterday following Robert Mugabe's announcement of the seizure of 804 mostly white-owned farms for the resettlement of poor black farmers.</p> <p>\"I don't know how to even begin leaving my farm,\" said Jim Sinclair, a white farmer faced with eviction by early next month. \"I had reckoned it would take five months to wind up the farm, not a few weeks.\"</p> <p>He said he feared an increase in lawlessness. \"This gives carte blanche to anybody who wants to move onto the farms. Some of them are armed.\"</p> <p>Five white farmers have been killed since Mr Mugabe's supporters began invading farms three months ago.</p> <p>In 1980, as president of the Commercial Farmers Union, he encouraged white farmers to continue under majority rule. Now Mr Sinclair sees little hope for Zimbabwe's large-scale farming. \"This will tear the heart out of commercial agriculture,\" he said. \"It's the beginning of the end of the economy of this country.\"</p> <p>Other farming families have begun packing up valuables in fear that their property will be invaded immediately.</p> <p>\"Our biggest fear is that there will be an influx onto the farms by people who are just going to go shopping for land, livestock and equipment,\" said Colin Cloete, a CFU official. The group is setting up a programme to help farmers relocate their families, protect farm workers, move household goods and livestock.</p> <p>An extraordinary government gazette was published yesterday announcing the confiscations. Some of the farms involved are owned by black Africans, most of whom are critics of Mr Mugabe.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe's action will enable his government to take possession of farms covering nearly 2m hectares (5m acres), by the time of the election on June 24 and 25.</p> <p>\"The president has called for a fast-track kind of resettlement with no elaborate infrastructure,\" said Vincent Kwenda, the director of land resettlement. But critics claim that without redevelopment only subsistence farming will be possible on seized land.</p> <p>People will be moved onto the farms by the end of June, despite the fact that the farm owners have 30 days to lodge legal objections to the confiscations. The new land legislation, written by Mr Mugabe and enacted last week, gives farmers few grounds to contest the seizures.</p> <p>Far from praising Mr Mugabe's move, many black Zimbabweans are dismissing it as an election ploy that will be disastrous for the country's long-term stability.</p> <p>\"It is an election gimmick which will result in environmental damage and will speed up our economic decline,\" said John Makumbe, a political science lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe.</p> <p>\"The people will not get adequate infrastructure, financial support or training to cultivate the land productively. It is unfortunate that Mugabe is so scared of losing power that he will damage the environment and the economy just to stay in office.\"</p> <p>The new legislation states that Britain is obliged to pay for the land seized from the African people during the colonial period. If Britain does not pay, states the law, then the Zimbabwe government is authorised to seize the land without paying compensation.</p> <p>The British government had earmarked \u00a337m for much-needed land reform in Zimbabwe, but Mr Mugabe's current land grab will not qualify for the funds.</p> <p>\"Land reform in Zimbabwe can only really succeed if it is transparent and legal,\" said the British high commissioner, Peter Longworth, yesterday.</p> <p>\"We have always said we are prepared to participate in such a plan. We are aware, as are many others, that well managed land reform is an important factor for social stability.\"</p> <p>Other international donors are expected to shun Mr Mugabe's hurried land expropriations. Officials from the United Nations Development Programme and the president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, have attempted in recent days to broker a compromise deal to raise international funds to pay for the white-owned farms.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of Zimbabwe's white farmers prepared to leave their land yesterday following Robert Mugabe's announcement of the seizure of 804 mostly white-owned farms for the resettlement of poor black farmers. \"I don't know how to even begin leaving my farm,\" said Jim Sinclair, a white farmer faced with eviction by early next month. \"I had reckoned it would take five months to wind up the farm, not a few weeks.\" He said he feared an increase in lawlessness. \"This gives carte blanche to anybody who wants to move onto the farms. Some of them are armed.\" Five white farmers have been killed since Mr Mugabe's supporters began invading farms three months ago. In 1980, as president of the Commercial Farmers Union, he encouraged white farmers to continue under majority rule. Now Mr Sinclair sees little hope for Zimbabwe's large-scale farming. \"This will tear the heart out of commercial agriculture,\" he said. \"It's the beginning of the end of the economy of this country.\" Other farming families have begun packing up valuables in fear that their property will be invaded immediately. \"Our biggest fear is that there will be an influx onto the farms by people who are just going to go shopping for land, livestock and equipment,\" said Colin Cloete, a CFU official. The group is setting up a programme to help farmers relocate their families, protect farm workers, move household goods and livestock. An extraordinary government gazette was published yesterday announcing the confiscations. Some of the farms involved are owned by black Africans, most of whom are critics of Mr Mugabe. Mr Mugabe's action will enable his government to take possession of farms covering nearly 2m hectares (5m acres), by the time of the election on June 24 and 25. \"The president has called for a fast-track kind of resettlement with no elaborate infrastructure,\" said Vincent Kwenda, the director of land resettlement. But critics claim that without redevelopment only subsistence farming will be possible on seized land. People will be moved onto the farms by the end of June, despite the fact that the farm owners have 30 days to lodge legal objections to the confiscations. The new land legislation, written by Mr Mugabe and enacted last week, gives farmers few grounds to contest the seizures. Far from praising Mr Mugabe's move, many black Zimbabweans are dismissing it as an election ploy that will be disastrous for the country's long-term stability. \"It is an election gimmick which will result in environmental damage and will speed up our economic decline,\" said John Makumbe, a political science lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe. \"The people will not get adequate infrastructure, financial support or training to cultivate the land productively. It is unfortunate that Mugabe is so scared of losing power that he will damage the environment and the economy just to stay in office.\" The new legislation states that Britain is obliged to pay for the land seized from the African people during the colonial period. If Britain does not pay, states the law, then the Zimbabwe government is authorised to seize the land without paying compensation. The British government had earmarked \u00a337m for much-needed land reform in Zimbabwe, but Mr Mugabe's current land grab will not qualify for the funds. \"Land reform in Zimbabwe can only really succeed if it is transparent and legal,\" said the British high commissioner, Peter Longworth, yesterday. \"We have always said we are prepared to participate in such a plan. We are aware, as are many others, that well managed land reform is an important factor for social stability.\" Other international donors are expected to shun Mr Mugabe's hurried land expropriations. Officials from the United Nations Development Programme and the president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, have attempted in recent days to broker a compromise deal to raise international funds to pay for the white-owned farms. But Mr Mugabe rejected the imposition of any conditions on how the land reform should be carried out. The economic effects of Mr Mugabe's hasty land resettlement are expected to be disastrous. The properties confiscated comprise nearly a quarter of the country's large-scale farms. Zimbabwe's commercial farming sector provides 40% of the country's export earnings and is the largest single employer, supporting 2m. The seizures could also trigger a failure of Zimbabwe's commercial banks which have lent more than \u00a3431m to the farming sector. The Foreign Office minister, Peter Hain, last night described a visit to Zimbabwe today by the shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, as \"irresponsible\" given the country's present volatility.",

For years the county's many pasty makers have seethed as up-country bakers have routinely attached the label \"cornish\" to what they consider are inferior products. But now they are fighting back. Even if they cannot always agree on the ingredients of what one leading manufacturer has dubbed \"the original convenience food\", they are turning to Europe to help protect what is widely acknowledged to be one of Cornwall's most important industries. Provided they can demonstrate the \"cultural significance\" of a food that once formed the staple diet of cornish tin miners, trading standards officers hope they will be able to persuade European law makers to give the county's pasties the same protected status granted to products such as Rutland beer and Newcastle brown ale. The Cornish pasty campaign aims to build on Cornwall's success in persuading the EU to prohibit anyone describing their clotted cream as Cornish unless it is manufactured there. Sympathetic government officials in London have warned, however, that the pasty's application is likely to be a more complicated affair because the raw ingredients do not always come from within the county and there is no agreement on its definitive recipe or shape. Consumer watchdogs are now calling on Cornish people to help them in compiling a comprehensive history of the food, so as to help in supporting their case. Liz Carveth, Cornwall's trading standards marketing officer, said the application would need to show that the pasty is a uniquely Cornish invention that is an essential to the local economy. \"We are not trying to stop anyone calling a pasty a pasty,\" she said yesterday. \"But if they are going to call it a Cornish pasty let's make sure it is made here in Cornwall.\" The pasty is said to date back hundreds of years, and became well known as the staple food of the county's \"tinners\". Today, more than 3m pasties are produced in Cornwall every week. With an annual turnover of \u00a3150m, the industry supports some 3,000 jobs in processing and manufacturing.",

As they emerged they were set against a horizon dominated by the undulating white cliffs of Dover. As it was 60 years ago, the weather was near perfect for sailing and the wind moderate. The crests of the low, greenish-brown waves were turned silver by a warm late-spring sun.</p> <p>Among the hundreds watching the departure was Dunkirk veteran Bill Hinchliff, 81, who was rescued from the French sands after three days trapped by incessant enemy fire.</p> <p>Bearing witness yesterday brought back the horror that left only 60 of his battalion of 908 young men alive. \"It was the most scared I've ever been in my life. We were under enemy fire all the time, being shelled with Stukas coming down. I was petrified by the noise of them.</p> <p>\"We just buried ourselves in the sand. We couldn't go in the basements of the houses because there were the dead bodies of troops in there.\"</p> <p>After this anniversary, the Dunkirk Veterans' Association, defeated by ageing, will wind itself up. That fact added poignancy to yesterday's graceful commemoration by the Dunkirk little ships of the role that they played in rescuing so many.</p> <p>Eight hundred craft, some barely 30ft long, were involved in Operation Dynamo, which it was hoped would save at best 45,000 troops. Some carried soldiers all the way back, avoiding heavy enemy fire and minefields, but most ferried troops off the beaches to larger ships anchored further off shore. Their role was invaluable.</p> <p>The former TV presenter Raymond Baxter, 78, is honorary admiral of the Association of Dunkirk Little Ships, which masterminded the commemoration. Yesterday was his seventh voyage of pilgrimage to Dunkirk, which is held every five years. The first was in 1965.</p> <p>Sixty years ago his motor yacht, L'Orage, ferried bloody troops, 34 at a time, off the beaches and to safety. He said: \"It's a celebration of one of the two turning points of modern world history, the other one being D-Day. If Operation Dynamo had been a disaster it's highly probable that Britain would have sued for peace.\"</p> <p>Sailing towards Dunkirk yesterday, as 60 years ago, were yachts, motor cruisers, barges and a cockle boat. All flew the defaced flag of St George, which vessels involved in the rescue earned, on which the Dunkirk coat of arms sits in the middle of the Red Cross of St George.</p> <p><b> Little ships</b><br> One vessel was more than 100 years old, another sat barely 2ft out of the water.

      "bodyText": "Sixty years on from their finest hour, a flotilla of small boats yesterday made their passage across the English Channel in a pilgrimage to Dunkirk, honouring those who evacuated 338,000 British troops. The vessels came to commemorate what Winston Churchill called \"a miracle of deliverance\", when the cream of the British army, trapped on the beaches, were saved from capture by the Nazis. Just after 9.15am the first of 61 small boats eased out of Dover harbour. As they emerged they were set against a horizon dominated by the undulating white cliffs of Dover. As it was 60 years ago, the weather was near perfect for sailing and the wind moderate. The crests of the low, greenish-brown waves were turned silver by a warm late-spring sun. Among the hundreds watching the departure was Dunkirk veteran Bill Hinchliff, 81, who was rescued from the French sands after three days trapped by incessant enemy fire. Bearing witness yesterday brought back the horror that left only 60 of his battalion of 908 young men alive. \"It was the most scared I've ever been in my life. We were under enemy fire all the time, being shelled with Stukas coming down. I was petrified by the noise of them. \"We just buried ourselves in the sand. We couldn't go in the basements of the houses because there were the dead bodies of troops in there.\" After this anniversary, the Dunkirk Veterans' Association, defeated by ageing, will wind itself up. That fact added poignancy to yesterday's graceful commemoration by the Dunkirk little ships of the role that they played in rescuing so many. Eight hundred craft, some barely 30ft long, were involved in Operation Dynamo, which it was hoped would save at best 45,000 troops. Some carried soldiers all the way back, avoiding heavy enemy fire and minefields, but most ferried troops off the beaches to larger ships anchored further off shore. Their role was invaluable. The former TV presenter Raymond Baxter, 78, is honorary admiral of the Association of Dunkirk Little Ships, which masterminded the commemoration. Yesterday was his seventh voyage of pilgrimage to Dunkirk, which is held every five years. The first was in 1965. Sixty years ago his motor yacht, L'Orage, ferried bloody troops, 34 at a time, off the beaches and to safety. He said: \"It's a celebration of one of the two turning points of modern world history, the other one being D-Day. If Operation Dynamo had been a disaster it's highly probable that Britain would have sued for peace.\" Sailing towards Dunkirk yesterday, as 60 years ago, were yachts, motor cruisers, barges and a cockle boat. All flew the defaced flag of St George, which vessels involved in the rescue earned, on which the Dunkirk coat of arms sits in the middle of the Red Cross of St George. Little ships One vessel was more than 100 years old, another sat barely 2ft out of the water. It was this flotilla of wood, glue and nails that played a role so much greater than the sum of its parts in preserving this island in an hour rich only with darkness. Some boats nearly failed to make the pilgrimage. Shrapnel was discovered in the hull of Firefly when it was being repaired. Four years ago the Southern Queen was a day away from being put on a bonfire, such was its disrepair, when Phil Hammond rescued it to stop \"another part of our history being destroyed\". Since then he has restored the craft estimated to have saved 1,000 troops, spending more than \u00a310,000 to join yesterday's convoy. It went back into the water only 10 days ago. During the voyage Mr Hammond, 57, said: \"Coming across has been so emotional. I am very elated we could be part of the celebrations, but there is also a lump in my throat about what happened 60 years ago. We've been on board living history today.\" From a few hundred yards away these dots of history in the channel were guarded by HMS Somerset. It was needed, as to reach Dunkirk from Dover the flotilla had to cross shipping lanes in one of the busiest maritime areas in the world. They sailed at between four and six knots. Most tankers, which dwarf them, dropped anchor and stayed out of the convoy's way as a mark of respect. The flotilla at times stretched 1.9 miles long, becoming more compact when the danger from other vessels was at its greatest. HMS Somerset, a type 23 frigate, also ferried over Admiral Robert Timbrell, 80. As a 20-year-old acting sub-lieutenant he captained the yacht Llanthony, which with five Scottish trawlers saved 900 troops. The day before setting out he had been in naval school. Mr Timbrell had hoped to be reunited with the yacht, owned in 1940 by Lord Astor, but bad weather prevented it from reaching Dover in time. But watching the armada sailing across the channel yesterday brought back to him memories from the last century, of dead troops floating off Dunkirk, of the three trips he made in darkness at the wheel of his vessel. In the chaos, he, like other captains, had to decide how best to effect the rescue. Mr Timbrell, a Canadian from Nova Scotia, said that his role in the rescue was his finest hour. \"The Dunkirk evacuation for a 20-year-old acting sub-lieutenant, who dare I say successfully lifted 900 troops, was a major event in my life.\" Halfway across the channel the RAF paid its own tribute to the heroism of the little ships. Lone Spitfire The blue sky was pierced by a lone Spitfire coming out of the sun, which flew over the convoy as low as mast height. Sixty years ago that was how close German fighter planes were getting. After six hours, the first of the 61 vessels reached Dunkirk to waiting crowds. The cruiseboat Papillon limped in on one engine after its starboard engine failed two miles from Dunkirk. Its owner, Ian Gilbert, 49, an avionics engineer, spent \u00a320,000 to join this ride. It was a small price to pay, he said, to honour those who ensured liberty. \"The boat is a unique part of our heritage.

If only life was so much fun and secret reports always so entertaining. I can recall clearly an overnight trip to Norfolk where I addressed the local vicar and six people in a church hall in Lowestoft. I don't recall that any of them had links with the Fourth International - perhaps they were the secret contacts with Rudi Dutschke? But personally I have still never travelled to Berlin. The problem with a secret service and secret reports is that they enable people of limited vision to invent a world of actions and motivations without ever having to justify them to those affected. Does the term \"secret intelligence report\" indicate that the report is secret, or, as appears more likely, that the intelligence is not only a secret but a complete mystery? David Robinson Wellington New Zealand david.robinson@vuw.ac.nz \u0095 I was proud to be a \"frighteningly radical\" Young Liberal at the Grosvenor Square demonstration against the Vietnam War in 1968.

While I'm certain Barry, who even in his cups could tell a hawk from a handsaw, knew the prevailing winds at, say, Faber, were set against him, he did expect support from medium-size, regionally-based presses such as Bloodaxe and I know he was devastated when they rejected the manuscript of Ranter, arguably his finest work, partly on the grounds that it was too similar to Ken Smith's Fox Running.</p><p>This rejection was still a fresh sore when we met on a writing course run by the Arvon Foundation, where Barry was an intimidating tutor whose evangelical faith in poetry was matched by enthusiasms for Bob Dylan, boots and shoes, and certain 60s girl singers. (For a while we traded tapes of Marianne Faithful and Sandie Shaw.) As a result of this meeting I devoted the bulk of the autumn 84 issue of Slow Dancer magazine to his work and published Ranter in full in 1985. Better the devil you know, Barry might have said, except he would have forsworn the clich\u00e9.</p><p><BR>  <B>Chris Hall</B><BR>London<BR><A HREF=\" mailto:slowdancer@mellotone.co.uk>slowdancer@mellotone.co.uk</a></p>",

      "trailText": "<p>Interview Hans Snook and Graham Howe, chief and deputy chief executive, Orange</p>",
      "byline": "David Teather",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Hans Snook is almost too easy a target for lampooning. There he sits in his feng shui'd office with moustache, receding rockabilly hairdo and black Nehru shirt with an Orange motif in the middle that makes him look faintly like a vicar, joking about his fondness for colonic irrigation. </p> <p>I am sure it must be here somewhere. Either a mug or a sticker on his computer bearing the old saw: \"You don't have to be mad to work here ...\" - and without the slightest hint of irony. </p> <p>Snook's studied eccentricity is stamped on the image of the mobile telephone company which he has run since it launched in 1994. He literally wears his offbeat personality on his sleeve - those funky Orange cufflinks - his office has a large fishtank and some aria or other is blasting out when I arrive. </p> <p>Snook, though, clearly has his talents, not least one for survival. In the past few weeks he and his senior management team, led by Orange's deputy chief executive and finance director Graham Howe, have managed to emerge from three changes in ownership at the helm of a larger, stronger, independent company. </p> <p><strong> Serendipity's part</strong><br> </p> <p> The revival of fortunes has been an astonishing turnaround. Just eight months ago Orange was bought for some \u00a320bn by the German telecommunications and engineering company, Mannesmann, and Snook's hangdog expression at the presentation of the deal was enough to say he was none too happy. </p> <p>Snook the showman did not like play ing second fiddle to the rather dull Mannesmann chief executive, Klaus Esser. </p> <p>Snook, 52, says that serendipity has always played a large part in his life - and it was certainly good fortune that his larger British competitor Vodafone then bid for Mannesmann and won what had become an ugly takeover battle. </p> <p>Regulators demanded the subsequent divestment of Orange, and along came France Telecom with an offer of \u00a326bn - certainly one that was too good to refuse. </p> <p>If all goes according to plan, France Telecom's mobile businesses will be bundled in with Orange, and the combined operation will be refloated on the London, Paris and New York stock markets with Snook and his management team in the driving seat. </p> <p>The combined business will have around 20m subscribers, with 6m in Britain, 10m in France and the remainder in start-ups or joint ventures throughout Europe, Hong Kong and Israel. </p> <p>Snook concedes that if Vodafone had not intervened he would no longer be at Mannesmann. Cynically, he could afford not to be - that tendency to rely on good fortune paid off doubly in the Mannesmann acquisition, which converted to hard cash some \u00a345m worth of share options and long term incentives that Snook had in place. </p> <p>When Orange is floated once again - and a likely date for that is early next year - Snook and Howe will no doubt be awarded a fresh tranche of options which will swell their bank accounts further. </p> <p>\"With France Telecom we had a brief courtship; we're now engaged and we are going to be married,\" Snook says in his mid-Atlantic accent. </p> <p>\"With Mannesmann it was more of a shotgun wedding. It was very unlikley that we could have stayed part of Mannesmann.\" </p> <p>It was clear in the rapidly consolidating telecommunications market as long as a year ago that something had to happen to Orange. Its weaker British competitor, One2One, had just been snapped up by Deutsche Telekom and Orange had the choice of either making an acquisition or becoming the target of a predator itself. </p> <p>Snook recalls: \"At the time we were very close to buying E-Plus [the German mobile telephone company], so our board was ready for growth. </p> <p>\"They understood Germany and even Hutchison [Orange's then largest shareholder] was ready to dilute. Mannesmann then came in to talk to us. If we had done E-Plus it would have put a bit of a stretch on our financial resources. It would have been the right thing to do, and our shares would have rocketed. </p> <p>\"But look at the conditions of the Mannesmann offer: they were offering cash and shares. It was a good price and our shareholders wouldn't have had to worry about increased debt. Mannesmann had promised something similar to what France Telecom have indicated, but Klaus was not able to deliver those elements simply because the management structure in Germany didn't allow it.\" </p> <p>It also quickly became apparent that Snook and Esser were singing from different song sheets. \"We would actually give different answers on the platform - even though we had an agreed position; with Michel Bon, who runs France Telecom, we have an agreed position and we tell the same story.\" Esser, he adds, misjudged just how much Vodafone needed to do a deal with Mannesmann in order to retain its own independence. </p> <p>With typical self-assurance, he suggests that the Germans underplayed the Orange card during the hostile bid process. </p> <p><strong> Likely contender</strong><br> </p> <p> Snook was clear that he would not be lured into another deal unless it was on his own terms. Advisers to the company made it plain during the negotiations with France Telecom that, unless their demands were met, he and his management team would quit. Orange had wanted a demerger from Vodafone rather than being put up for sale. </p> <p>\"My concern was that Chris Gent [Vodafone's chief executive] would have liked to have sold Orange to a weaker competitor, and sucked a lot of cash out of that competitor and made it even weaker. </p> <p>\"Hopefully it would also be to a competitor that we didn't like, so a lot of senior management would leave. It would have been a triple win for Vodafone and I said that can't be allowed to happen, and if that does happen we are going to walk. </p> <p>\"We wanted a company that was public again. We knew we would have to move very, very fast and use the currency of our shares to either acquire companies after that, merge with companies or find a strategic investor - all we've done is reverse that position and got France Telecom in as a strategic shareholder up front, and when we float now we will be a much larger company.\" </p> <p>Howe adds that the company could possibly do its next deal ahead of flotation. Finnish mobile telephone company Sonera, KPN of Holland, and Bell South and MCI Worldcom from the US are mentioned as candidates. </p> <p>\"Because of our circumstances we know all these companies extremely well now, and if there is something possible we remain the more likely contender. We know who our management team would fit with and who our vision is aligned with. This won't be the end of the road.\" </p> <p>They shrug off any suggestions of possible culture clashes with France Telecom, which after all is still half owned by the French government. Its mobile business, which trades as Itineris, was- Snook says - born in competition and shares all the same entrepreneurial, youthful characteristics as Orange. </p> <p>Snook is often dubbed a visionary and his enthusiasm for the future development of mobile phone technology is admittedly infectious. One of his favourite fancies is an ear stud or lapel badge that will not only be a communications device but help to organise the wearer's life, reminding them of appointments and so on. </p> <p>Snook waxes lyrical about a hologram on his desk and says the company is investigating ways of using the technology which comes from a New York-based firm. Why not, for instance, have holographic projections of the management team at roadshows instead of the real thing? Unsurprisingly he cannot leave his phone alone and in between chomping on a toothpick he repeatedly checks his handset for incoming text messages. </p> <p>Snook refutes the suggestion that Orange follows the cult of his personality. Howe, dressed in a white version of Snook's eyebrow-raising corporate shirt, could have been deliberately trotted out to present the team and underline that this is not a one-man show. \"Hans's eccentricities are his alone,\" Howe adds. \"We are not all into colonic irrigation.\" </p> <p><strong> Corporate cult</strong><br> </p> <p> However, the intense admiration for Snook among colleagues and advisers means that many of his traits are repeated, without much charm, among others in the company. </p> <p>His favoured phrases - one is \"wirefree future\" - are used with depressing regularity. Press conferences are arranged on cramped double-decker buses painted orange (what a jape!) because the company likes to do things differently. Staff at Orange do not call you on their mobile phones, they call you on their \"Orange\", but do not appreciate jibes suggesting they verge on the Moonie-like. </p> <p>Snook's unconventional beginnings are well documented. Born in Germany to an English father and German mother, he grew up in Canada. At 35, he was backpacking in Asia with his Chinese wife when he took a job in a paging business in Hong Kong to raise funds for further travelling. He was convinced to stay, and that company was eventually bought by Hutchison Whampoa - which moved him to Britain for the launch of Orange. </p> <p>Howe, 39, was a fellow founding director and previously worked at Hutchison Telecom, First Pacific and Touche Ross management consultancy.

      "bodyText": "Hans Snook is almost too easy a target for lampooning. There he sits in his feng shui'd office with moustache, receding rockabilly hairdo and black Nehru shirt with an Orange motif in the middle that makes him look faintly like a vicar, joking about his fondness for colonic irrigation. I am sure it must be here somewhere. Either a mug or a sticker on his computer bearing the old saw: \"You don't have to be mad to work here ...\" - and without the slightest hint of irony. Snook's studied eccentricity is stamped on the image of the mobile telephone company which he has run since it launched in 1994. He literally wears his offbeat personality on his sleeve - those funky Orange cufflinks - his office has a large fishtank and some aria or other is blasting out when I arrive. Snook, though, clearly has his talents, not least one for survival. In the past few weeks he and his senior management team, led by Orange's deputy chief executive and finance director Graham Howe, have managed to emerge from three changes in ownership at the helm of a larger, stronger, independent company. Serendipity's part The revival of fortunes has been an astonishing turnaround. Just eight months ago Orange was bought for some \u00a320bn by the German telecommunications and engineering company, Mannesmann, and Snook's hangdog expression at the presentation of the deal was enough to say he was none too happy. Snook the showman did not like play ing second fiddle to the rather dull Mannesmann chief executive, Klaus Esser. Snook, 52, says that serendipity has always played a large part in his life - and it was certainly good fortune that his larger British competitor Vodafone then bid for Mannesmann and won what had become an ugly takeover battle. Regulators demanded the subsequent divestment of Orange, and along came France Telecom with an offer of \u00a326bn - certainly one that was too good to refuse. If all goes according to plan, France Telecom's mobile businesses will be bundled in with Orange, and the combined operation will be refloated on the London, Paris and New York stock markets with Snook and his management team in the driving seat. The combined business will have around 20m subscribers, with 6m in Britain, 10m in France and the remainder in start-ups or joint ventures throughout Europe, Hong Kong and Israel. Snook concedes that if Vodafone had not intervened he would no longer be at Mannesmann. Cynically, he could afford not to be - that tendency to rely on good fortune paid off doubly in the Mannesmann acquisition, which converted to hard cash some \u00a345m worth of share options and long term incentives that Snook had in place. When Orange is floated once again - and a likely date for that is early next year - Snook and Howe will no doubt be awarded a fresh tranche of options which will swell their bank accounts further. \"With France Telecom we had a brief courtship; we're now engaged and we are going to be married,\" Snook says in his mid-Atlantic accent. \"With Mannesmann it was more of a shotgun wedding. It was very unlikley that we could have stayed part of Mannesmann.\" It was clear in the rapidly consolidating telecommunications market as long as a year ago that something had to happen to Orange. Its weaker British competitor, One2One, had just been snapped up by Deutsche Telekom and Orange had the choice of either making an acquisition or becoming the target of a predator itself. Snook recalls: \"At the time we were very close to buying E-Plus [the German mobile telephone company], so our board was ready for growth. \"They understood Germany and even Hutchison [Orange's then largest shareholder] was ready to dilute. Mannesmann then came in to talk to us. If we had done E-Plus it would have put a bit of a stretch on our financial resources. It would have been the right thing to do, and our shares would have rocketed. \"But look at the conditions of the Mannesmann offer: they were offering cash and shares. It was a good price and our shareholders wouldn't have had to worry about increased debt. Mannesmann had promised something similar to what France Telecom have indicated, but Klaus was not able to deliver those elements simply because the management structure in Germany didn't allow it.\" It also quickly became apparent that Snook and Esser were singing from different song sheets. \"We would actually give different answers on the platform - even though we had an agreed position; with Michel Bon, who runs France Telecom, we have an agreed position and we tell the same story.\" Esser, he adds, misjudged just how much Vodafone needed to do a deal with Mannesmann in order to retain its own independence. With typical self-assurance, he suggests that the Germans underplayed the Orange card during the hostile bid process. Likely contender Snook was clear that he would not be lured into another deal unless it was on his own terms. Advisers to the company made it plain during the negotiations with France Telecom that, unless their demands were met, he and his management team would quit. Orange had wanted a demerger from Vodafone rather than being put up for sale. \"My concern was that Chris Gent [Vodafone's chief executive] would have liked to have sold Orange to a weaker competitor, and sucked a lot of cash out of that competitor and made it even weaker. \"Hopefully it would also be to a competitor that we didn't like, so a lot of senior management would leave. It would have been a triple win for Vodafone and I said that can't be allowed to happen, and if that does happen we are going to walk. \"We wanted a company that was public again. We knew we would have to move very, very fast and use the currency of our shares to either acquire companies after that, merge with companies or find a strategic investor - all we've done is reverse that position and got France Telecom in as a strategic shareholder up front, and when we float now we will be a much larger company.\" Howe adds that the company could possibly do its next deal ahead of flotation. Finnish mobile telephone company Sonera, KPN of Holland, and Bell South and MCI Worldcom from the US are mentioned as candidates. \"Because of our circumstances we know all these companies extremely well now, and if there is something possible we remain the more likely contender. We know who our management team would fit with and who our vision is aligned with. This won't be the end of the road.\" They shrug off any suggestions of possible culture clashes with France Telecom, which after all is still half owned by the French government. Its mobile business, which trades as Itineris, was- Snook says - born in competition and shares all the same entrepreneurial, youthful characteristics as Orange. Snook is often dubbed a visionary and his enthusiasm for the future development of mobile phone technology is admittedly infectious. One of his favourite fancies is an ear stud or lapel badge that will not only be a communications device but help to organise the wearer's life, reminding them of appointments and so on. Snook waxes lyrical about a hologram on his desk and says the company is investigating ways of using the technology which comes from a New York-based firm. Why not, for instance, have holographic projections of the management team at roadshows instead of the real thing? Unsurprisingly he cannot leave his phone alone and in between chomping on a toothpick he repeatedly checks his handset for incoming text messages. Snook refutes the suggestion that Orange follows the cult of his personality. Howe, dressed in a white version of Snook's eyebrow-raising corporate shirt, could have been deliberately trotted out to present the team and underline that this is not a one-man show. \"Hans's eccentricities are his alone,\" Howe adds. \"We are not all into colonic irrigation.\" Corporate cult However, the intense admiration for Snook among colleagues and advisers means that many of his traits are repeated, without much charm, among others in the company. His favoured phrases - one is \"wirefree future\" - are used with depressing regularity. Press conferences are arranged on cramped double-decker buses painted orange (what a jape!) because the company likes to do things differently. Staff at Orange do not call you on their mobile phones, they call you on their \"Orange\", but do not appreciate jibes suggesting they verge on the Moonie-like. Snook's unconventional beginnings are well documented. Born in Germany to an English father and German mother, he grew up in Canada. At 35, he was backpacking in Asia with his Chinese wife when he took a job in a paging business in Hong Kong to raise funds for further travelling. He was convinced to stay, and that company was eventually bought by Hutchison Whampoa - which moved him to Britain for the launch of Orange. Howe, 39, was a fellow founding director and previously worked at Hutchison Telecom, First Pacific and Touche Ross management consultancy. The two appear genuinely fond of each other. Certainly their achievements in launching and stewarding Orange are not in question - although suggestions that Snook came up with the name are wide of the mark. The company launched as the first recognisable consumer brand in mobile telephones, and with an iconic advertising campaign. It also challenged the way in which users were charged, introducing per-second billing. In recent months it has regularly topped the rankings for signing new customers. Snook's mantra is customer service - which, he will tell you at length, is the key to winning and, equally important, retaining customers. Endearingly, however, his evangelism slips at least once as he recounts the launch of Orange. \"We needed a brand with new values from Vodafone and Cellnet,\" before drifting off with a wince and noting, \"God, I'm starting to sound like Tony Blair.\"",

The New Millennium Experience Company, which runs the attraction, said just over 500,000 people visited the site last month, with an average 16,200 people passing through the turnstiles every day. The dome needs to attract an average of more than 20,000 people every day to reach the target which was brought down last month from a break-even figure of 10m visitors. When the \u00a3758m attraction opened to the public in January, the NMEC hoped to draw 12m people over the year. Last month's disappointing attendance figures - the worst since January - come after the NMEC was forced to seek a cash lifeline from the Millennium Commission, which has already given more than \u00a3500m to the beleaguered attraction. However, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, the NMEC's chief executive, was yesterday upbeat about the the dome's prospects of meeting its revised target. \"We are well on our way to achieving our new, realistic, target of 7m visitors,\" said Mr Gerbeau, who believes figures will be boosted by an influx of tourists and schoolchildren over the summer.

People who could have raised the alarm failed to do so, out of inertia, out of fear, or simply because, in the world which they moved in, the consultant was god.

But as the report also says: \"Rodney Ledward bears the greatest responsibility for the failures in his practice.\"</p> <p>The full truth of his disastrous reign in south Kent cannot even now be established. Not all his victims will have come forward: some are still too embarrassed to talk about the problems, like incontinence, with which they were left by his botching. The number of his victims probably runs into hundreds. In six cases, husbands blame him for the deaths of their wives. Not all the evidence which came before the Ritchie inquiry was hostile. Some patients recorded their gratitude for what he had done for them. Some pupils saluted his exceptional teaching skills. Some colleagues still say he was scapegoated. But all that fades when compared with the dreadful cata logue of Mr Ledward's malpractices: the apparently unnecessary operations on private patients; the equally needless hysterectomies for women in their twenties; the constant pressure on NHS patients to switch to his private practice; the frantic pace he worked at; the occasions when he turned up for operations apparently the worse for drink. And the blunders, the perforations of bladder and bowels - far more in a matter of years than a competent consultant could be expected to cause in a lifetime.</p> <p>There are people serving substantial prison sentences for inflicting less misery, pain and bodily harm than he did. Though he never admitted as much, and does not now, he must have known the risks he was running and the permanent damage he was doing to patients. It was not in the remit of the Ritchie inquiry, but on the face of this evidence it is hard to see why - unless his health would preclude it - there has been no sign yet of criminal proceedings. He has lost his career, and the secretary of state is urgently considering his NHS pension, but even the loss of that seems a quite inadequate price for what he has done. Medicine was too lenient with Mr Ledward. The law should not make the same error.</p>",

Not all his victims will have come forward: some are still too embarrassed to talk about the problems, like incontinence, with which they were left by his botching. The number of his victims probably runs into hundreds. In six cases, husbands blame him for the deaths of their wives. Not all the evidence which came before the Ritchie inquiry was hostile. Some patients recorded their gratitude for what he had done for them. Some pupils saluted his exceptional teaching skills. Some colleagues still say he was scapegoated. But all that fades when compared with the dreadful cata logue of Mr Ledward's malpractices: the apparently unnecessary operations on private patients; the equally needless hysterectomies for women in their twenties; the constant pressure on NHS patients to switch to his private practice; the frantic pace he worked at; the occasions when he turned up for operations apparently the worse for drink. And the blunders, the perforations of bladder and bowels - far more in a matter of years than a competent consultant could be expected to cause in a lifetime. There are people serving substantial prison sentences for inflicting less misery, pain and bodily harm than he did. Though he never admitted as much, and does not now, he must have known the risks he was running and the permanent damage he was doing to patients. It was not in the remit of the Ritchie inquiry, but on the face of this evidence it is hard to see why - unless his health would preclude it - there has been no sign yet of criminal proceedings. He has lost his career, and the secretary of state is urgently considering his NHS pension, but even the loss of that seems a quite inadequate price for what he has done. Medicine was too lenient with Mr Ledward. The law should not make the same error.",

      "bodyText": "The Anglican church in Canada is braced for bankruptcy, submerged by claims for damages for the alleged sexual abuse of native Canadians in its children's homes amounting to C$2bn (about \u00a3900m). Legal fees are rapidly eating into its reserves of C$10m, and attempts to persuade the government to bail it out have so far been unsuccessful. The government has even more cases of its own to deal with. The church's 26 residential homes, some of which had been operating since the 1820s, were closed in 1969, and church leaders have been apologising ever since for the way they were run as part of a heartless attempt to assimilate tribal youngsters into white culture by removing them from their families and training them in the white man's ways. This seems to have included not only emotional and physical abuse and neglect but also frequent sexual assaults. In a statement read out at church services this week, the Primate of Canada, the Most Rev Michael Peers, admitted that the church would not be able to survive in its current form. \"We are faced with litigation so costly as to change radically our structures and our life as a national church,\" he said. \"The legacy of the schools has been deeply wounding. We have an obligation and a will born of our desire to be just, to account for past injustice.\" The revelations of the spartan and loveless conditions in the homes and the traumas suffered by the children who were forced into them mirror similar allegations involving schools and homes run by churches across the world, from Ireland to Australia. The archbishop first admitted the Anglican church's culpability in an emotional statement to an Indian convention seven years ago. Angry Indians walked out as he said: \"I am sorry more than I can say that we were part of a system which took you and your children away from home and family, tried to remake you in our image, taking from you your language and the signs of your identity... that in our schools so many were abused physically, sexually, culturally and emotionally.\" The Canadian Anglican Journal, which carried a long report on the affair last month, quoted one of the first to receive a settlement, Ben Pratt of the Gordon Indian reserve at Punnichy, in Saskatchewan. Mr Pratt said: \"It's not like the money will make me happy or make me feel better, but I might as well get something for what those bastards did to me. \"Around here it's called arse money. It's supposed to be dirty.\" Mr Pratt is said to have received C$46,000 compensation for being repeatedly raped from the age of seven by William Starr, director of the residential home on the reservation in the 1960s, and later administrator of the school. Mr Starr was convicted in 1993 of sexually assaulting 10 boys under 14 between 1968 and 1984. At least 7,000 Indians have lodged cases, mostly against the government, although 1,600 of them cite the church as a co-defendant. The church's legal costs topped C$1.5m last year and already exceed C$150,000 this year. Duncan Wallace, bishop of the Saskatchewan diocese of Qu'Appelle, told the journal: \"If just 20 of the cases the church faces go the way the first one did, we will be bankrupt, there's no doubt about it.\" At the church's national executive council last month, Archbishop Peers said: \"There are those who say this is God's judgement that the church has lost its way. \"Maybe so, but the people being judged are from generations earlier... if bankruptcy becomes inevitable, we really are called to be the body of Christ Dead. \"Absolutely dead.

      "bodyText": "For the first time, the White House yesterday designated a \"dirty dozen\" kingpins of the international drugs trade, freezing their US assets and putting any companies which assist them under notice that they face millions of dollars in fines and other penalties. All 12 of the drugs bosses named by the Clinton administration yesterday are familiar enough figures in the global smuggling economy but there are doubts about the extent to which any of them currently has significant assets inside the US. The move's primary significance is as part of a renewed attempt by the US to target a network of businesses and individuals who can be linked to the so-called \"kingpins\" with a range of tough economic sanctions. The 12 were named in a letter sent by President Bill Clinton to the US Congress under the terms of the 1999 Drug Kingpin Designation Act, which establishes a global sanctions regime aimed against major international traffickers and their networks. Six of the 12 are Mexicans, some of whom are already under arrest in their home country. The remaining six include two from south-east Asia, both currently based in Burma, two from the Caribbean and two who are on the run in Nigeria. \"This dirty dozen are at the start of a growing process which targets the bad guys rather than continuing with nation-to-nation head-butting,\" said a congressional aide to one of the drafters of the legislation. The new law has been criticised by American civil liberties campaigners who warn that there is no effective redress for anyone who is wrongly designated under the act. Mexico has also complained that the act could be used as part of a political campaign against Mexican immigrants in the US. The Mexicans listed by Mr Clinton include two sets of brothers: the Tijuana-based Ramon and Benjamin Arellano-Felix, who run one of the most notoriously violent drugs operations in the Americas, and Jose de Jesus and Luis Ignacio Amezcua-Contreras, who control a Mexican-based metamphetamine cartel. Ramon Arellano-Felix is also currently on the FBI's \"10 most wanted\" list. Rafael Caro Quintero, who is currently in prison in Mexico, and Vicente Carillo Fuentes, the head of the Juarez drugs cartel, complete the Mexican section of the White House kingpin list. Also on the list are Chang Chi-Fu, more widely known as Khun Sa, and Wei Hsueh-Kang, both of whom are dominant figures in the south-east Asian drugs world and who both currently operate unhindered in Burma. Oluwole and Abeni Ogungbuyi are Nigerians who fled from the US more than a decade ago following their arrest on charges of smuggling heroin. The other two kingpins are Noel \"Zambo\" Heath and Glenroy \"Bobo\" Matthew, who come from St Kitts-Nevis and who are both wanted for extradition to the US on drugs charges which relate to their roles in Colombian cocaine cartels. The principal aim of the designation of the 12 suspects is to target US or US-owned banks and businesses which can be linked to the kingpins' operations. Under the Kingpin Act, these companies face fines of up to $10m (\u00a36.6m), with individuals liable for prison sentences of up to 30 years. A list of such businesses must be published later this year by the US treasury department under the terms of the new law. \"This action underscores our determination to do everything possible to fight drug traffickers, undermine their operations and end the suffering that the trade in illegal drugs inflicts on Americans and people around the world,\" the presidential press secretary, Joe Lockhart, said in a statement. \"If this tool didn't exist, even if you were under indictment you could do business with a bank. You cannot do that now,\" said Senator Paul Coverdell, a Georgia Republican who was one of the two principal authors of the law, along with Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat. \"We now have improved tools to deny these criminals their illicit profits and track them down, no matter where they may hide,\" the White House drugs \"tsar\", General Barry McCaffrey, said. Leaders of the 'dirty dozen' Wei Hsueh-Kang Believed to be in hiding in Burma, the Chinese-born Wei, also known as Prasit Chivinnitipanya, is head of the United Wa State Army, the most powerful heroin smuggling organisation in south-east Asia. Sentenced to death in his absence in Thailand in 1987, he has a $2m US price on his head. Chang Chi-Fu, also known as Khun Sa, the veteran drug baron and former leader of the Shan United Army now lives unhindered in Rangoon, having 'surrendered' to the Burmese regime in 1996.

      "bodyText": "Bill Clinton's valedictory European tour was marred yesterday by blunt public criticism that US plans to develop a controversial missile defence system could rekindle a global arms race and weaken Nato. The US president was in Aachen to receive the coveted International Charlemagne prize for European Unity but behind the compliments there was rising anger at plans for the so-called \"son of star wars\" scheme - a defence shield designed to protect the US from nuclear missiles. \"Of course, it is the sovereign right of our American allies to make the decision which they regard as necessary for their external security,\" the German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der said, after the two leaders discussed the issue on Thursday. \"However, as this issue could have an impact far beyond the United States, it is in the alliance's interest to deal with it in a spirit of friendship.\" Earlier this week the French president, Jacques Chirac, issued a similarly candid warning, asking: \"How do you convince [nations] to stop piling up new arms when more powerful countries say it's necessary to develop technologies that put hard-won strategic balances into question?\" The comments added to a rising chorus of concern from the US's European allies. Mr Clinton can also expect to encounter concern in Moscow today when he meets the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for the first time - but there were signs last night that an agreement could be reached. Mr Clinton's European tour, which ends in Ukraine, is expected to be his last before the presidential elections in November, unless he re-visits Northern Ireland. Earlier this week, at the biennial US-EU summit in Lisbon, he sidestepped unresolved transatlantic trade disputes over hormone-treated beef, bananas, and tax subsidies to promise worried Europeans that the controversial missile technology could be shared with \"civilised nations\". Washington says the multibillion dollar defence system is needed to shoot down rockets fired by rogue states such as Iraq and North Korea. Returning yesterday to European fears of US domination, Mr Clinton pledged to strengthen the transatlantic bond many believe has frayed in the post-cold war period. But Mr Schr\u00f6der stressed the importance of fledgling European defence efforts. These worry the US, which fears that complex EU arrangements will never produce a credible military force and may undermine Nato. Many Europeans feel that last year's Kosovo crisis underlined the urgency of creating autonomous defence forces, though more progress has been made on building bureaucratic structures than fighting capabilities. Mr Chirac also called for EU governments to push ahead with plans to create a 60,000-strong mobile force. In Moscow, meanwhile, Mr Putin told NBC television that the countries could develop the proposed missile shield together. While it remains unclear whether the US is prepared to share its interception technology, the Russian leader hinted that such an arrangement might produce a compromise. \"Such mechanisms are possible if we pool our efforts towards neutralising the threats against the US, Russia, our allies, and Europe in general,\" Mr Putin said. \"We have such proposals and we intend to discuss them with President Clinton.\" Signalling his good intentions in his Aachen speech, the US president urged Europeans to try to make Russia welcome. \"No doors can be sealed shut to Russia, not Nato's, not those of the European Union,\" he said. The EU's other task was to \"de-Balkanise\" the south-east of Europe and make it a full part of a united continent. Mr Clinton was the first American president to receive the Charlemagne prize, which has previously been awarded to Sir Winston Churchill, Konrad Adenauer and Tony Blair.",

Wednesday morning and the shock workers of Europe's financial capital flooded into mighty Euston only to learn that its underground station had been closed because of overcrowding. The wage slaves were advised to try Euston Square or Warren Street. The latter was also closed because of overcrowding but a notice advised \"customers\" to give Euston a go. Memo to Tube bosses: can we please have the upside of this time-machine trip (the pub on Sloane Square station, smoking carriages, proper red trains...)? </p> <p>\u0095 Things fall apart (2): Tuesday morning was no time to become a victim to fraud or embezzlement. Enemy action - or possibly a gremlin - knocked out the entire telephone system at Serious Fraud Office HQ in Elm Street, London, with even callers to Mama Doc's ultra-hush private line being told by a robotic phone company voice that no connection was possible.

NatWest customers have just found themselves in receipt of a letter asking them to fill in a questionnaire about standards of service from NatWest. The missive is signed by Tim Jones, chief executive of retail banking. Doubtless it was another head of retail banking, also called Tim Jones, who left NatWest shortly after Royal Bank of Scotland's successful takeover in March. Coming soon: the District Bank customer satisfaction survey. </p> <p>\u0095 On the satisfaction theme, Bayer, the venerable German medicines group, is going into battle against the anti-impotence drug Viagra with its own \"erectile dysfunction treatment\", Vardenafil. Presumably impotence medicines, as with 1950s nuclear bombers, have to have names beginning with V. Bayer expects to earn about \u00a3bn a year from this little potion, possibly as a result of synergies with another famous Bayer product, aspirin. Male customers can overcome their impotence and the women in their life can cure their headaches. </p> <p>\u0095 Elsewhere in the world of, er, adult relationships, distressing news for fans of the father of the modern market economy, Friedrich Hayek. We fed the great man's name into the computer and awaited a stack of useful information, courtesy of the web. Sad to say, the first eight places under \"Hayek\" have been bagged by someone called Salma Hayek, whose internet sites claim to specialise in material of the no-clothes-on variety. His/her idea of the \"road to serfdom\" is rather different from that of the late professor, whose own page is a sorry number nine. We clicked no further on the Salma front for fear of alerting the Gary Glitter investigation team. Far more wholesome is \"retired Judge Carolyn J Hayek\", of Washington State, who \"performs weddings throughout the Puget Sound area\". </p> <p>\u0095 Finally, Bank of England governor Eddie George's grace and favour pad in New Change, near St Paul's Cathedral, is threatened by the modern mania for cost effectiveness, we hear. The lease on the flat - scene of many a drama, not least Mr George's hasty return from a skiing trip in February 1995 to try to salvage something from the Barings debacle - may be terminated, it seems. What is the Bank boss to do - become a Big Issue salesman?</p>",

Coming soon: the District Bank customer satisfaction survey. \u0095 On the satisfaction theme, Bayer, the venerable German medicines group, is going into battle against the anti-impotence drug Viagra with its own \"erectile dysfunction treatment\", Vardenafil. Presumably impotence medicines, as with 1950s nuclear bombers, have to have names beginning with V. Bayer expects to earn about \u00a3bn a year from this little potion, possibly as a result of synergies with another famous Bayer product, aspirin. Male customers can overcome their impotence and the women in their life can cure their headaches. \u0095 Elsewhere in the world of, er, adult relationships, distressing news for fans of the father of the modern market economy, Friedrich Hayek. We fed the great man's name into the computer and awaited a stack of useful information, courtesy of the web. Sad to say, the first eight places under \"Hayek\" have been bagged by someone called Salma Hayek, whose internet sites claim to specialise in material of the no-clothes-on variety. His/her idea of the \"road to serfdom\" is rather different from that of the late professor, whose own page is a sorry number nine. We clicked no further on the Salma front for fear of alerting the Gary Glitter investigation team. Far more wholesome is \"retired Judge Carolyn J Hayek\", of Washington State, who \"performs weddings throughout the Puget Sound area\". \u0095 Finally, Bank of England governor Eddie George's grace and favour pad in New Change, near St Paul's Cathedral, is threatened by the modern mania for cost effectiveness, we hear. The lease on the flat - scene of many a drama, not least Mr George's hasty return from a skiing trip in February 1995 to try to salvage something from the Barings debacle - may be terminated, it seems. What is the Bank boss to do - become a Big Issue salesman?",

The greatest ambassador for Latin music in the 20th century, his impassioned style of Latin jazz, his high-energy drumming and delicate vibraphone playing attracted adoring audiences for decades in countries as far removed from Latin America as China and Japan, Russia and the UK. In home territories in South America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, his reputation was summed up by his singing partner of nearly 50 years, the queen to his king, Celia Cruz: \"Our world is in mourning because one of the souls of Latin music has died.\"</p> <p>Puente had never contemplated retirement. In February this year, he received his fifth Grammy - for the Mambo Birdland album - and was recently honoured by the US government on a postage stamp. His last concert in April was in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p> <p>Puente was a musician's musician, a composer, arranger and bandleader, and a showman. He had a childlike delight at jokes and teasing, and realised very early on the significance of giving a performance more than just musical. In the late 30s, while playing with the band of Cuban singer Machito, he dragged his timbales drum kit to the front of the stage and never went back into the shadows. From then on, his solos were instantly a star attraction.</p> <p>Ernesto 'Tito' Puente Jr, the son of a factory foreman, was born and raised in New York, though he spent a few years as a child with his family in Puerto Rico and remained devoted to the island and its culture for life. His music education - on piano - began in Manhattan, spurred on by his mother, who would secretly take 25 cents for the class from his father's coat pocket. With his younger sister Annie, he took up dancing, slick and neat as he would be all his life, and as he boasted later, one of the few bandleaders who could actually dance.</p> <p>As a teenager, he played timbales and piano in several Latin bands around town, and was heard by the newly arrived Cuban pianist and bandleader, Jos\u00e9 Curbelo. Joining up with Curbelo, Puente learned about band-leading and business before moving on to play with Machito, who was creating the template for Afro-Cuban jazz with his partner Mario Bauza.</p> <p>Puente's career was interrupted by the war - he served in the US Marines - but on his return he studied composition at the Juilliard School of Music and emerged to found his first band, the Picadilly Boys. By then, many Cuban musicians were in town, bringing with them an infectious and highly syncopated new dance called the Mambo; Puente was hooked. Within a couple of years, he was drawing vast crowds with performances in the Mecca of the dance, the Palladium Ballroom on 52nd Street, just along from the world famous bebop jazz club, Birdland.</p> <p>For Puente this was an opportunity to see at close quarters the arrangements of musicians such as Stan Kenton and Dizzy Gillespie, who also shared a passion for Cuban music. Thus began Puente's long connection with the American jazz scene, and the foundations were laid for some brilliant collaborations on future records.</p> <p>In his comprehensive biography, Tito Puente and the Making of Latin Music, Steven Loza compares Puente's significance in American music to that of Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. The 1997 tribute album Commemorating Tito Puente, 50 Years of Swing offers 50 tracks from all stages of his career, beginning with his first successful recording Que no, que no! in 1946, sung by his future rival for the title of Mambo King, Tito Rodriguez. As revealed on this fondly conceived box set, his range of musical styles and collaborators was exceptional: from the raucous brassy Americanised versions of Cuban rumbas, mambos and chachachas to Latin-jazz encounters with the leaders of the genre (Ray Baretto, Mongo Santamaria, pianists Charlie Palmieri, Hilton Ruiz and Michel Camilo) and also members of the American camp, George Shearing, Lionel Hampton, Woody Herman, and fellow vibraphonist Cal Tjader, to New York's more recent commercial salsa.</p> <p>The 1999 tribute song, El Cien (The Hundred - to commemorate his 100th album), is a textural delight, a flash-past of the most significant voices of salsa in the past few decades, including, of course, Celia Cruz, the most significant Latin singer of the century.</p> <p>Puente drew each new generation of musicians into the fold. His genuine interest in them and their ideas kept his own music fresh. Through his Tito Puente Foundation, he enabled poor Hispanic musicians to attend music college. By the 90s, he had become a mentor and unlikely icon for many young Latin hiphop crossover producers and musicians, including his son, the percussionist Tito Jr.</p> <p>Puente did not always approve of new trends and commercially motivated salsa; he certainly didn't feel any compulsion to praise them or conform to the car-chase, big band merengues which dominated the charts in the late 80s. He said - in a rare flash of irritation - that he would sooner stop playing than have to play them. But he was open to serious, committed changes, especially at the jazz end of the Latin music spectrum.</p> <p>Puente's repertoire of Latin jazz and salsa includes more than 100 albums and scores of singles. Individual songs are known worldwide and reappear in new guises. He reclaimed the timeless Oye Como Va from Carlos Santana who sowed the seeds of today's interest in Latin music when he gave it the electric Latin rock treatment at the Woodstock Festival in the 60s.</p> <p>Since then, the non-Latin population and America's mainstream media have woken up to his presence among them (a secret privately enjoyed in the Latino communities). His music became increasingly desirable and was used in film soundtracks and signature tunes (his friend Bill Crosby adopted a Puente song as his show's signature tune and appeared frequently on stage with him at the famous \"Latin Meets Jazz\" nights at New York's Village Gate club). In the movie of The Mambo Kings, Puente played a musician playing at the Palladium in the mambo heyday.</p> <p>In 1981, Puente visited London with his Latin Jazz Sextet - a streamlined, tight, inventive outfit which took the city by surprise. Backstage, Puente said he was amazed at the reaction and couldn't wait to come back. In 1984, he returned with his full band and Celia Cruz out front; it was an unforgettable night. This country's love affair with salsa was confirmed.</p> <p>Puente's death marks a new century in Latin music, but one which is grounded entirely in his music - and his mischievous and passionate personality.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Margie, two sons and a daughter.</p> <p>\u0095 Ernesto (Tito) Anthony Puente, musician, born April 20 1923; died May 31 2000</p>",

Now I'll have to walk to the all-night convenience store for a coldie.\" The Japanese are fond of their vending machines, which sell everything from fresh flowers to sex aids. The merchants' association agreed as long ago as 1994 to do something about illegal purchases of alcohol by the under-20s, but attempts to introduce a smart-card system to check the age of customers came to nothing. Rising adult drunkenness has added to the pressure: it is not uncommon to see smartly dressed men staggering along railway platforms or asleep in the gutter, and the media have focused on \"kitchen drinkers\" - alcoholic housewives. By itself, the vending machine ban is unlikely to have much of an impact: 24-hour convenience stores, which are almost as numerous as beer machines, often sell beer through the night, and beer and sake are available at station kiosks and takeaways. Off-licence owners want shops which sell to under-age drinkers to be penalised.",

A jury at the Old Bailey took just 10 minutes to find Eden Strang, 26, not guilty by reason of insanity on charges of attempted murder and assault after hearing he was in the grip of extreme paranoid schizophrenia. Eleven churchgoers were left seriously injured when Strang burst naked into the Sunday morning service at St Andrew's Roman Catholic Church in Thornton Heath last November after hearing voices telling him the worshippers were demons in human form. Psychiatrist Jonathan Vince told the court that Strang had probably been mentally ill for seven years and believed he could communicate with God through his computer. But his paranoid schizophrenia had gone largely unnoticed and he had failed to receive medical treatment. Dr Vince said Strang's illness had developed to such a degree that there was nothing else in his mind than that the whole world was full of demons out to destroy him and his family. He said it was \"quite extraordinary\" to find someone in a state of that disorder. \"He suffered from a defect in reasoning as a direct result of the disease of mind. \"I believe he was not able to appreciate what he was doing was wrong either morally or legally. He thought he and his family would be apocalyptically destroyed.\" Strang's victims suffered lasting injuries after he lashed out at them with the 3ft sword. Paul Chilton lost part of his hand and suffered permanent damage to his jaw when Strang attacked him. He spent seven hours on the operating table, and needed 40 pints of blood and 100 stitches to his face.

Not only is the prospect of endless speculation about election dates a complete turnoff, the electorate would simply not understand if the government held an election before it has served its full term.\"</p> <p>There has been widespread assumption that the election will be held next May, at the same time as county council elections. But senior Labour figures insist no detailed work has yet been done on election timing. It is possible that the government will wait until May 2002.</p> <p>Mr Wright's warning came as senior figures in the engineering union sounded a sceptical note over suggestions Mr Blair is willing to strike a deal with Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy on electoral reform, under which both will back the alternative vote.</p> <p>That would be a deep disappointment to Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, who published an official report last year recommending a form of top-up voting system designed to give a more proportional result.</p> <p>The AV system requires voters to name their candidates in order of preference, with the first candidate to get more than 50% winning.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat and Labour electoral reformers say it fails to produce a proportional result, but some Liberal Democrats claim it is the only system that will win the support of the Labour party.</p> <p>But the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, leading party sponsors of the First Past the Post Campaign, were hostile to the deal last night.

Tony Wright, the MP for Cannock Chase and chairman of the Commons public administration select committee, said last night: \"I hope the prime minister will kill off all speculation about an early election by saying that he intends the parliament to run its full term. \"We have a big majority and we rightly keep saying how long it takes to deliver the benefits of the programmes we are putting in place. Not only is the prospect of endless speculation about election dates a complete turnoff, the electorate would simply not understand if the government held an election before it has served its full term.\" There has been widespread assumption that the election will be held next May, at the same time as county council elections. But senior Labour figures insist no detailed work has yet been done on election timing. It is possible that the government will wait until May 2002. Mr Wright's warning came as senior figures in the engineering union sounded a sceptical note over suggestions Mr Blair is willing to strike a deal with Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy on electoral reform, under which both will back the alternative vote. That would be a deep disappointment to Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, who published an official report last year recommending a form of top-up voting system designed to give a more proportional result. The AV system requires voters to name their candidates in order of preference, with the first candidate to get more than 50% winning. Liberal Democrat and Labour electoral reformers say it fails to produce a proportional result, but some Liberal Democrats claim it is the only system that will win the support of the Labour party. But the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, leading party sponsors of the First Past the Post Campaign, were hostile to the deal last night. Political officer Tom Mann said: \"AV is known to punish the losers hard and does not create the consensus politics that some want.\"",

The NUT, the largest teaching union, rejected a vote by delegates at its conference in Harrogate at Easter to hold a ballot on strike action. But yesterday the union's alternative to the strike - to launch a joint campaign with another union against the government's plan - immediately hit the rocks. A spat developed between the union and its would-be partner the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers. Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NAS/UWT, demanded an apology from his NUT counterpart, Doug McAvoy, for what he called an \"outrageous accusation in his conference report that we were supporting the government on performance-related pay\". Mr de Gruchy said: \"There is no question of us giving consideration to a joint campaign unless he retracts that statement and issues an apology.\" Mr McAvoy had announced yesterday that a joint meeting would be held with the NAS/UWT on Tuesday, the day after the deadline for applications by classroom teachers for performance-related pay. Delegates at the conference had voted by a 60-40 majority to hold a ballot. But the executive believed the rank and file membership would vote no in a ballot. A survey of members produced a 30% response rate and only three out of five participating wanted a strike. A legal challenge in Wales to performance-related pay may also be successful.

They will then believe they are famous and have no need to break their banks. \u0095 In this space two weeks ago I addressed my visiting pest, the pedant, as \"chummy.\" A reader writes to inquire if I have any connection with Drogheda, the only place to his knowledge where the term is in common use. I find this astonishing. I had always thought the term was the stuff of daily banter from Lerwick to Looe and from Lurgan to Liskeard. I have no connection with Drogheda and have never set foot in the place, though I do know two things about it. (1) It isn't pronounced as spelled, but is made to rhyme, more or less, with embroider. (2) There used to be a peer of this name, who was big in culture. A rural psychiatrist writes : It is also an anagram of hog-dread, a condiction which afflicted the Shropshire peasantry between the years 1771 and 1803. Smallweed responds with cringing reverence : But of course. That explains everything.",

The scenery is bewilderingly lovely since it changes entirely every 100 yards, many of the villages are gorgeous, and the place is full of fabulous pubs whose signs indicate their desperation for you to sample their local ales and fresh seafood. </p> <p>Yet the council appears to have decided that there is no vista which cannot be improved by a caravan park, so as you're walking along a vertiginous cliff top, the sun sparkling on the foaming sea, gulls wheeling below you, Portland Bill shining in the distance, you suddenly come upon what might be an aerial view of the H-blocks of the Maze prison. </p> <p>Something else which continues to puzzle me is why petrol companies seem to have a complete dispensation from planning permission. Take Burton Bradstock, a village which looks as if it's copied from an Olde English jigsaw puzzle box, with flower -festooned thatched cottages from which you half expect to see a hedgehog in a pinny emerge with a basket of pegs. In the Anchor my son and I played bar skittles under the tutelage of a kindly gap-toothed and bearded local. It was idyllic. But just at the edge of the village is a hideous Texaco station, all huge red signs and today's prices in letters large enough to be read from Lyme Regis. </p> <p>Why is this? Is the assumption that motorists will drive for hours to immerse themselves in rustic beauty, but are too blind to see a filling station? If they can read the handwritten signs in windows saying: \"Dainty cream teas\" surely they can spot \"Texaco\" or \"Esso\" in letters less than three feet high? </p> <p>\u0095 Lunching in Cerne Abbas, under the great priapic giant, I read about how Radio 1 had just sacked Andy Kershaw, one of the most thoughtful, enterprising and humane broadcasters in the country. (Now there's a scandal Gordon Brown should worry about; I bet his Rochdale accent didn't help him.) On the way home, our daughter wanted the same station on the radio. </p> <p>We caught Chris Moyles, a man who makes Tony Blackburn sound like Professor Joad. It was drivel. You wanted to wipe the radio with a Kleenex. There was a long discussion about Denise van Outen's breasts. There was a shorter chat about how Mr Moyles (or a sidekick) wanted to see that appalling film in which All Saints appear naked. </p> <p>He and his friends had a vocabulary slightly larger than an intelligent chimp, though possibly smaller than some of the smarter dolphins. Things they approved of were \"nice\", \"good\", \"great\" or, if really admirable, \"the canine testicles\". As they droned on and on about nothing, saying nothing, filling up the empty airwaves with a greater vacuum, each record came as an intense but regrettably short relief. </p> <p>\u0095 Like Douglas Adams, the late Paul Jennings had a game in which he gave British place-names their real definitions, as opposed to the drearier ones propounded by etymologists (why does everything turn out to mean \"settlement\", or occasionally \"settlement by the oak trees\"?). To Jennings, Leeds meant \"a horse's nostrils\". Erith was what a philanderer did, as in the old phrase, \"man erith, woman morpeth\". There was headstrong, as in \"none of your bovey tracey ways here, miss!\" </p> <p>Jennings must have loved Dorset, where the true meaning of most village names leaps out at you, hardly requiring translation at all. Gussage St Michael, for instance, is clearly a pair of chain store knickers. When you have a hangover, you feel Duntish. Beer Hackett is an alcoholic scribbler who wrote the hard-hitting \"'Swelp Me, Guv\" column in the old News of the World.

      "byline": "Adrian Searle",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The Royal Armouries has an image problem. It is difficult to have a museum of weapons, of arms and armour, without it appearing to glorify war and death. There are plenty of people who revel in the hardware, who get a kick out of all this stuff. I find the place grim and chilling. </p> <p>For the past couple of years the Royal Armouries has been collecting and commissioning art as a corrective to this Boy's Own world of militaria, and an exhibition of the aquisitions, Warning Shots, opens today. The typography of the title - italics and caps -may be forced, the bullet-point issues clunking (\"Popular Culture - violence as portrayed by the mass media\"; and \"The impact of real or imagined violence on innocence and the child\") but the message is clear enough. Violence is bad. </p> <p>The exhibition is a roll-call of modern manners and strategems. In a nasty little video Chicago artist Tony Tasset gets himself shot in the chest again and again. He stands against a white wall and a shot rings out; he is thrown back and slides bloodily down the wall, smearing the whiplash cascades of red which have erupted around him. Called Squib, the work utilises movie techniques to simulate getting wacked, rubbed out, ventilated by a gun. It is unpleasant, but you watch all the same, over and over, to spot the mechanics of the stunt. This is a made-for -TV death. </p> <p>Across the gallery hangs a big colour photograph by Israeli artist Ori Gersht, a real shot of a wall in Bosnia. It is a pretty picture of an ochre painted wall in slanting sunshine, a spiral staircase climbing to a door in the middle of the picture. It is travel brochure stuff, except that the wall is pocked with bullet-holes, picked-out in the raking light. Nothing is actually happening, but there's menace here all the same. </p> <p>The catalogue (overdesigned, mendacious and uncertain how to pitch itself) talks about scars on the landscape bearing witness to psychological damage. It is difficult to disagree, or to escape the cliches. There's a hand-wringing element to all this, as though the artists were being used as sticking-plasters. </p> <p>The late Andrea Fisher's photograph - taken from a media photograph of a dead girl on the ground in Bosnia, is cropped to show a bit of her head, her hand clutching a purse, her hairband among the fallen leaves on the pavement. A real hairband, just like the girl's, sits on a plinth nearby. This, I think, is about the only instance where the trace of a victim appears in the whole museum. It is the more telling for its utter ordinariness. </p> <p>Originally, Christine Borland's installation The Quickening, The Lightening, The Crowning was intended to be placed inside the Armouries' permanent displays. Her museum cabinets, filled with a selection of guns handed in after the massacre at Dunblane, and leather-covered babies' skulls and maternal pelvises (used as demonstration models in hospital training), with a soundtrack that mixes foetal heartbeats and gunshots, would have been fitted seamlessly among all the other weaponry and with the Robert Hardy commentaries that waft through the halls. It is a brave commission but it would have been braver to insinuate it among the other displays.

      "bodyText": "The Royal Armouries has an image problem. It is difficult to have a museum of weapons, of arms and armour, without it appearing to glorify war and death. There are plenty of people who revel in the hardware, who get a kick out of all this stuff. I find the place grim and chilling. For the past couple of years the Royal Armouries has been collecting and commissioning art as a corrective to this Boy's Own world of militaria, and an exhibition of the aquisitions, Warning Shots, opens today. The typography of the title - italics and caps -may be forced, the bullet-point issues clunking (\"Popular Culture - violence as portrayed by the mass media\"; and \"The impact of real or imagined violence on innocence and the child\") but the message is clear enough. Violence is bad. The exhibition is a roll-call of modern manners and strategems. In a nasty little video Chicago artist Tony Tasset gets himself shot in the chest again and again. He stands against a white wall and a shot rings out; he is thrown back and slides bloodily down the wall, smearing the whiplash cascades of red which have erupted around him. Called Squib, the work utilises movie techniques to simulate getting wacked, rubbed out, ventilated by a gun. It is unpleasant, but you watch all the same, over and over, to spot the mechanics of the stunt. This is a made-for -TV death. Across the gallery hangs a big colour photograph by Israeli artist Ori Gersht, a real shot of a wall in Bosnia. It is a pretty picture of an ochre painted wall in slanting sunshine, a spiral staircase climbing to a door in the middle of the picture. It is travel brochure stuff, except that the wall is pocked with bullet-holes, picked-out in the raking light. Nothing is actually happening, but there's menace here all the same. The catalogue (overdesigned, mendacious and uncertain how to pitch itself) talks about scars on the landscape bearing witness to psychological damage. It is difficult to disagree, or to escape the cliches. There's a hand-wringing element to all this, as though the artists were being used as sticking-plasters. The late Andrea Fisher's photograph - taken from a media photograph of a dead girl on the ground in Bosnia, is cropped to show a bit of her head, her hand clutching a purse, her hairband among the fallen leaves on the pavement. A real hairband, just like the girl's, sits on a plinth nearby. This, I think, is about the only instance where the trace of a victim appears in the whole museum. It is the more telling for its utter ordinariness. Originally, Christine Borland's installation The Quickening, The Lightening, The Crowning was intended to be placed inside the Armouries' permanent displays. Her museum cabinets, filled with a selection of guns handed in after the massacre at Dunblane, and leather-covered babies' skulls and maternal pelvises (used as demonstration models in hospital training), with a soundtrack that mixes foetal heartbeats and gunshots, would have been fitted seamlessly among all the other weaponry and with the Robert Hardy commentaries that waft through the halls. It is a brave commission but it would have been braver to insinuate it among the other displays. That would give the gun-club visitors something to think about. Somewhere along the line, Warning Shots tries to cover too many bases, and pays lip service to too many issues. Faisal Abdu'allah's big photo-screenprints of a scary, gun-toting kid dressed in gangster-rap uniform don't really tell us anything much except that you don't want to meet this guy. Where's the deconstruction, I ask, where's the critique? Finally, future wars. Up in the collection is a speculative display of the weapons of the future, including a life-sized space cadet with a giant laser weapon, with a spoof label telling us about some war in a distant part of the galaxy.

They do so either by borrowing or by relying on parents. Starting life in debt or expense, even for supposed greater rewards later, is a disincentive, and is felt especially by the already least advantaged. It is therefore an irony that a government which is reintroducing a money obstacle, and with it a serious derogation from merit as the sole criterion, should focus on influence, under the disguise of the \"old school tie\" - a much diminished and ever-diminishing factor - as a political ploy.

By the way - while I am panting - the Concise Oxford Dictionary says, very mildly, that the expression \"start a hare\" means \"raise a topic of conversation\"; but Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable (revised edition, 1981) comes closer to the real meaning, in my opinion, by adding the usually relevant word \"irrelevant\" to the definition. The hare in this sense is a relative of the red herring. </p> <p>The column on Tuesday was about crime and punishment and it finished like this: \"...it doesn't matter a hoot how beastly you intend to be to villains if you don't collar them first. Mrs Beeton formulated the first law of criminology, albeit in a different context: 'First catch your hare'.\" </p> <p>This brought an immediate email from a reader who said, \"Actually, she didn't.\" Nowhere in the admirable works of Isabella Beeton, he maintained, is anything remotely similar to be found. Certainly there is nothing like it in the undated (perhaps 1930s) edition of Mrs Beeton's Family Cookery that I have before me, although she has a great deal to say about hares. She tells me, not how to catch one, but how, when they are in season from September to March, to select from the market a good, young one (\"The ears are tender and easily torn\"); advises me to hang it for about a week (depending on the weather) and not to paunch [disembowel] it until required for cooking. </p> <p>She tells me how to skin it - by hanging it from a hook so that both hands may be employed in the task. She instructs me in the preparation of jugged hare - a recipe that Auntie Win used on the farm at Hockliffe in my childhood - and gives the recipes for a wide variety of other hare-y dishes. But nowhere does she remind me that I must first catch the hare before I can cook it. </p> <p>So who did say it? Here is Brewer again: \"First catch your hare. This direction is generally attributed to Hannah Glasse, habit-maker to the Prince of Wales, and author of The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy (1747). Her actual directions are, 'Take your Hare when it is cas'd, [cased] and make a pudding ...etc' To 'case' means to take off the skin...\" </p> <p>The Oxford English Dictionary says, rather playfully, \"First catch your hare (ie as the first step to cooking him): a direction jestingly [my italics] ascribed to Mrs Glasse's Cookery Book [1747], but of much more recent origin.\" </p> <p>The Dictionary of National Biography, which says (correctly) that Mrs Glasse was the habit maker to the Princess - not the Prince - of Wales, fails to enlighten us: \"The attribution to Mrs Glasse of the proverb 'First catch your hare' has occasioned some discussion. The proverb is not found in her Art of Cookery, but her words, 'Take your hare when it is cased' may have suggested it.\" </p> <p>It should be said, perhaps, that simple instructions such as this (don't try to cook it with the skin on) were more Mrs Glasse's cup of tea than Mrs Beeton's. As Mrs Glasse herself said, \"If I have not wrote in the polite Stile I hope I shall be forgiven; for my Intention is to instruct the lower Sort.\" Do not be confused by the title of a recent edition of Mrs Glasse's book: First Catch Your Hare (details below). The book dismisses as a myth the attachment of the phrase to Mrs Glasse. </p> <p>Brewer asserts, \" 'First catch your hare,' is a very old phrase...\" then it points to a passage in \"the 13th century Bracton\". This is the work of the jurist Henry de Bracton, De legibus et consuetudinibus Angliae (On the Laws and Customs of England). But what Bracton says, as Brewer concedes, is \"It is commonly said that you must first catch your deer, when it is caught, skin it.\" Obviously we are not having that: a deer is not a hare. </p> <p> No, we come back to the OED's contention that the phrase is of much more recent origin than the mid-18th century of Mrs Glasse's book. The OED finds a reference in Thackeray's The Rose and the Ring, 1855: \" 'A soldier, Prince, must needs obey his orders: mine are . . . to seize wherever I should light upon him.'

      "body": "<p>On the very day that the Observer reported on its front page that the army is to train women soldiers for combat roles, ITV broadcast the first 90-minute instalment of a two-part drama about a woman officer in the British Army. It was appropriately called Rough Treatment, for the woman was brutally raped in a shower room by two fellow officers when they caught her making love with another officer. The officer she liked behaved almost as badly as the rapists by running away from the scene, leaving her to her fate, and then lying in court to get them acquitted. The second part of the drama, broadcast on Monday, was about the woman's fearsome revenge on these three repulsive men, two of whom had been expelled from their regiment in disgrace and were now doing rather well in business. </p> <p>Typically of British television dramas, Rough Treatment had a rotten script and a thoroughly unconvincing plot. But if it was doing anything, it seemed to be making a strong case against women being in the army at all. Even before the rape, the heroine's treatment by her male colleagues was far worse than any woman would have to bear in any other profession. She was resented for her soldierly courage and initiative, and therefore accused of just \"playing\" at being a soldier. She was referred to as \"a stuck-up bitch\" when she rejected sexual advances, and as \"a silly little tart\" when she succumbed to them. Still, on she soldiered, full of pride in her regiment and determination to succeed, slogging her guts out against all the odds, only to be rewarded with a double rape and an end to her military career. </p> <p>I don't think any woman wanting to join the army would pursue the idea any further after seeing this television film. But there are many women in the army already, and the question now is whether they should be allowed to brandish bayonets in the front line, just as their male comrades do. The Ministry of Defence has now decided to challenge the traditional wisdom of the armed services, that women should not engage in hand-to-hand fighting. It is putting them through a series of trials this year to test their strength, courage and psychological aptitude for the bloody work of combat. According to the Observer, they will be tested in both mixed-gender and all-women units to see how they fare. One aim is to study how men react to the presence of women on the battlefield. Then, within 12 months, a committee of experts will produce a report for the ministry entitled A Study Of Combat Effectiveness And Gender. </p> <p>If there are women seeking equal rights with men to kill and to be killed, I commend them for their courage, but I don't think it would be any fairer to pit women against men in battle than to have men and women play tennis against each other at Wimbledon. If women are to form their own combat units in the British army, there should be a new international convention to ensure that the enemy units they face should also be composed of women. Another option would be to leave all combat entirely to women, with each side committing itself in advance to accept the outcome without sending any men into battle. That would at least be fair, and it might also make war a little less brutal. </p> <p> At Wimbledon, of course, they also have the mixed doubles championship, and there are going to be the mixed-gender tests as part of this year's military trials. Considering all the fuss that was made about homosexuals in the armed services in the past, when military chiefs argued that their very presence threatened team discipline, I am surprised that this point hasn't yet been made with regard to women. Certainly, in Rough Treatment, the actress Daniela Nardini completely shattered team morale. Gay men and women are now welcome in the armed forces after winning a series of discrimination cases at the European Court of Human Rights, and the official line has become that they do not threaten team discipline unless they engage in overt displays of affection - the same principle that is applied to heterosexuals. </p> <p>But what of anti-gay prejudice in the ranks? This is likely to be a problem. Certainly it is a serious one in the US, where Private Barry Winchell was last year battered to death by a fellow private at an army base in Tennessee because he was thought to be gay. But was he? His lover was a nightclub performer called Calpernia Addams, a man who was in the process of becoming a woman. It may be that he loved her not as a man, but as the woman she/he wanted to be. Meanwhile, gay-rights activists have turned Barry Winchell into a martyr for their cause, but in doing so have had to insist that Calpernia is a man, which has caused her/him enormous distress. These gender issues are unbearably complicated.</p>",

The next stage was to pepper the schedule with young-wrinkly icons: Paul Merton, selecting his classic comedy archive (a clever move to keep both old and new audiences happy); then, on Saturday mornings, Jonathan Ross, a washed-up 80s know-all who magically reinvented himself as the professionally out-of-touch man, knowingly unable to name a single modern record on Never Mind the Buzzcocks. </p> <p>The result is a bizarrely radical station.

Kershaw is rumoured to have been offered a job at Radio 2 (as has Simon Mayo). His arrival would cement, depressingly for me, the fact that I am now officially a Radio 2 listener. It wouldn't even be an ironic thing any more. I'd simply be there. Here was a DJ whom I grew up with. In sacking him, Radio 1 is saying that da kidz don't want to know about the Senegalese nose-flute revolution any more (not even at three in the morning).

      "body": "<p>My husband and I work in offices 10 miles apart and in totally different industries. That's how we like it. Out to work, home to play. Private life and personal life firmly separated. That is the secret of success in both arenas - or so we thought. But, having talked to three couples, all of whom run highly successful design-retail businesses (and marriages, too, it appears), I see that the rules of separation that we consider so crucial to a happy relationship and satisfying career aren't always necessary.</p> <p>Judging from these people, the reason couples become business partners seems to have more to do with expediency than rigorous planning. One decides to fulfill his/her ambition to go it alone, and the other finds spously support soon leads to full-time involvement.</p> <p>Andrew Purves, one half of the couple who set up the smart contemporary furniture emporium Purves &amp; Purves, certainly has no romantic illusions about shared vision. \"I think quite often couples end up working together because, for one partner or the other, it's cheap labour.\" he says. \"You've got one household but double the input.\" (Pauline Purves, who has given her financial skills and buyer's eye cheaply from the start, takes this put-down very well.)</p> <p>Ros Sacher is similarly realistic. When her husband Jerry left Marks and Spencer to set up the all-American lifestyle shop Jerry's Home Store, she soon realised that, as it was going to take over his life, she'd better join the work-force, too. The position of public-relations officer was an obvious choice. \"Jerry comes back and unpacks his samples on the carpet,\" she says, \"so I see the stuff and, because he talks about it a lot, I know what's going on. I think that, in a small business, when you're very busy it would be difficult to brief a PR company to do the job. Also, we do have three children, so this is ideal. I can work from home and it can be as full- or as part-time as I want it to be.\"</p> <p>Phil Webb can sympathise. Not that long ago his wife, Victoria Suffield, seemed happy enough running an eclectic interiors shop - The Hambledon Gallery, in Blandford, Dorset - with her mother, while he did consultancy work from home. Then she decided \"it would be a laugh\" to put together a mail-order catalogue as a sideline that she could run out of the back of the shop. He should have spotted the danger signs and got himself a full-time job in the city. Within a year, the \"pet project\" had grown unmanageably large. Victoria was still very committed to the shop and didn't want to give it up, so either the catalogue, House, had to be shelved (life-long row fodder, or what?) or Phil had to give up consultancy and buckle down, too. Four years on, Phil is running the mail-order side from the barn in the garden while Victoria, who is also responsible for styling the catalogue and all the buying, is based at the new shop, The Hambledon, in Winchester.</p> <p>So how does it work? How do they all manage the pressures and irritations of shared work on top of the pressures and irritations of marriage and family life?</p> <p>Physical separation seems to be vital - none of these three couples actually works in the same place, if they can help it - as does a clearly defined job description. Ros Sacher does the PR and that's all. Victoria Suffield expects Phil to respect her buying and styling decisions, and in return keeps out of all matters relating to mail order. Pauline Purves sticks to the marketing and fights a natural instinct to interfere with matters on the shop floor - and she doesn't find it easy: \"Because we set up this business together, I feel really passionate about it and I find it very difficult to walk into the shop and not view it like my own sitting room. I'd like to be able to do this or that. But I mustn't do it because there is a management team.\"</p> <p>That's very laudable, adult behaviour, of course, but (and I'm hoping for some row revelations here) surely the fact that the marketing manager or buyer or managing director is also a spouse means professional conventions are sometimes forgotten in the heat of the moment? Surely sometimes one half of the team behaves in an irrational, domestic manner rather than a cool, professional one? Not at House or Jerry's Home Store, apparently - or at least, if they do, the Webb/Suffields and the Sachers are keeping quiet. The Purveses are a bit more forthcoming, admitting that occasionally they do have heated discussions that are \"a little more honest\" than they might be if they weren't married. But that's a far as they'll go. It's harmony all the way - apparently.</p> <p>Assuming that they can all keep petty disagreements about whose turn it is to do the shopping out of their working lives, can they keep work out of their private lives?</p> <p>On this one, two out of three couples fall down. Andrew Purves claims to have no trouble switching off when he comes home, and Pauline says they rarely talk about the business at all. But Ros and Jerry and Phil and Victoria admit that work knows no boundaries. \"The problem is,\" says Jerry, \"that we are a business that trades 363 days a year. Over the weekend, the stores ring their figures through to the house, and I visit the stores every weekend. It's a pressure of time, and I know it drives Ros mad, but sometimes the only time you have to discuss things is in the evening or at the weekend.\"</p> <p>It's the same with Webb and Suffield. They have a rule that they don't discuss work while the kids are awake, and that they don't work at the weekend, but in practice it doesn't quite work. The mail-order office is in the garden, so they can hear the phone ring if they're outside, and, while Phil may not actually answer it over the weekend, he does sneak in to collect the messages. \"Work never goes away,\" Victoria says, \"and I do resent it in a way. I love it, but I would also like to have a normal life.\"</p> <p>So what about benefits? Flexibility seems to be the biggest one. With at least a part of each business based at home, working and looking after a family (they all have three children) is relatively straightforward.</p> <p>And then there are the shopping opportunities. Jerry Sacher spent the entire interview lying in one of the two Jerry's Home Store leather recliners that furnish the study/ children's room (this may be a large house in a smart and fashionable bit of London, but it is very much a family home); and when I arrived, we had coffee around a large, zinc-topped table that I have often lusted over in the shop.</p> <p>You can play spot-the-stock in the Purves' incredibly light, three-storey apartment, too - although here you can also see the downside of working with furniture. \"At some stage, we're going to buy a sofa,\" Andrew says, surveying their almost-minimal sitting/dining room, \"but the idea of choosing something...\" The thought of shopping in his leisure time is so awful that he can't even finish the sentence. For now, they sit around the table (damaged stock on loan from the shop until they buy one of their own) or on the floor.</p> <p>I couldn't see much House stock in Phil and Victoria's rustic-with-an-urban-twist home (although from the dining-room window I spotted several hundred packing cases, debris from a delivery of their best-selling stone balls). But, apparently, you can see quite a lot of their furniture at the shops. Their dining table, for example, has been at the Winchester site since it opened - but, no, it's not for sale. \"I would do anything for money,\" laughs Victoria, \"but I won't sell the table.\"</p> <p>So would they recommend this working-marriage thing? Interestingly, no one quite answers the question but, judging from the success of their businesses, it must have something going for it - even if it is, as Mr Purves says, just high- quality labour for a minimal wage</p> <p><b>Contacts</b></p> <p>Purves &amp; Purves, 020-7580 8223 (<a href=\"http://www.purves.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.purves.co.uk</a>)</p> <p>Jerry's Home Store, 020-7581 0909 for branches</p> <p>House, 01725 552549 (<a href=\"http://www.housemailorder.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.housemailorder.co.uk</a>)</p>",

Grown-up, she earned acclaim for her role in Band Of Gold, and starred in Sunburn. Her voice features in The Miracle Maker, an animated film about the life of Jesus. What is your idea of perfect happiness? Gathering all the people I love on the island of Paros, dancing and sipping cool beers together. What is your greatest fear? Spiders. What is the trait you most deplore in yourself? I'm scatty, I lose things all the time. What is the trait you most deplore in others? Disloyalty. What is your greatest extravagance? Skincare - you can never have too many wrinkle creams. Where would you like to live? Sometimes Japan, sometimes New York, sometimes Paros. What do you most dislike about your appearance? My height - I'd like to be five inches taller (and blonde). What is your most unappealing habit? I'm impatient at times. What is your favourite smell? Christmas. What is your favourite word? Pickle. What or who is the greatest love of your life? My mum. Which living person do you most despise? I try not to despise anyone - but Roy Chubby Brown is really pushing me. Have you ever said 'I love you' and not meant it? No. What is your greatest regret? Not learning to drive. When and where were you happiest? On holiday with my family in 1998, our first holiday together - we just ate and laughed. How do you relax? A hot bath, meditation, a good romantic comedy, being smothered in face-pack. What would your motto be? Face the fear, and do it anyway. What keeps you awake at night? Clubbing. How would you like to be remembered? With an enormous statue in Trafalgar Square - I think there's room. What is the most important lesson life has taught you? We're not here long enough to mess around.",

This wine, like all those in this week's column, is available at Majestic Wine Warehouses, a company that more than one reader has beefed about due to its inflexible policy of selling only by the case or mixed case. Nevertheless, on the basis of the price and quality of certain of its bottles, Majestic can peddle a bargain as shrewdly as any. This merlot is wonderful, happy juice, parading leather, tannins, blackberries and plums, a hint of cinnamon, and a lingering finish. It rates 17 points and costs \u00a35.99 per bottle (as part of a mixed case of other wines), but if you buy two or more bottles you can pick it up for \u00a34.99. </p> <p>Pirramimma Cabernet Sauvignon 1998 (17 points, \u00a37.99, or \u00a36.99 for two bottles or more), from Australia, is intensely concentrated and deep, and has a lushly textured tightness that opens up deliberately and deliciously with stunning tannins. Pirramimma Petit Verdot 1997 (17 points, \u00a38.99, or \u00a37.99 for two bottles or more) really races over the tastebuds, sweeping all before it as it does so. It has a sullen spiciness at first, then the huge tannins arrive, and it's one long torrent of richness and depth. </p> <p>Chteau Flauguergues Cteaux du Languedoc 1998 (17.5 points, \u00a36.99, or \u00a35.99 for two bottles or more) is very elegant. The tannins and the fruit are deliciously melded and softened one into the other, and the finish is inspired. This is a very serious yet fun-to-drink wine. Chteau Trignon Ctes du Rhne Villages Sablet Ramillades 1998 (17.5 points, \u00a36.49, or \u00a35.99 for two bottles or more), meanwhile, has absolutely compelling richness and beautifully earthy tannins. The quintessence of elegant rusticity, it's a compelling performer from nose to throat: teasing, taut and tenacious. Domaine de Rodes Syrah Vin de Pays d'Oc 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a33.99, or \u00a33.49 for two bottles or more) has rousing richness, layered, earthy fruit and offers stunning value at the two-bottle price. </p> <p>Mas de Bressades Cabernet Syrah Vin de Pays du Gard 1998 (17 points, \u00a36.99, or \u00a36.49 for two bottles or more) presents irreproachable tannins linked to thrusting hedgerow fruitiness. Marvellous old world/new world marriage of styles (ie, softness and ripeness with character and backbone). Mas de Bressades Cuv\u00e9e Excellence Costi\u00e8res de Nmes 1998 (17.5 points, \u00a36.99, or \u00a36.49 for two bottles or more) has more eagerness on the finish than its cab/syrah brother, a tighter texture and a slightly more lingering, individual finish. </p> <p>Even more individuality is in evidence with Aglianico del Vulture 1997 (18 points, \u00a39.99), from Basilicata in southern Italy. It is a mineral-tinged treat, combining concentrated ripeness and the unique tang of the grape and the region. It is an altogether beautiful, confident, stunning mouthful. As is Valpolicella Classico Superiore Domini Veneti 1996 (17 points, \u00a36.99) The individuality stays the sane side of eccentricity while offering spice, cherries, leather, sweet blackberries, soft tannins and a hint of prune. </p> <p>Also from Italy, and to round things off on a high note, is Capitel Monte Olmi Amarone Tedeschi 1995 (17.5 points, \u00a318.49), which is a lot of money, but for a lot of wine. It is an outstandingly joyously quaffable wine of coal-mine depth yet dainty-finishing richness. It combines fennel, spiced plums, blackberries and savoury tannins. Available in very limited quantities at all branches, it is a wine for a special occasion.</p>",

The day would start with thick, heavy mist, and 7am was (and will for weeks remain) ideal for going into the garden.</p> <p>At that time, scents are heaviest on the air. You move from the orbit of one to the next, with scarcely a break between. Take, for instance, the incense rose, Rosa primula , which smells exactly of that. A few years ago, Fergus moved it from where it wasn't doing very well to where it is now extremely happy, but that happens to be eight or so metres from the nearest path, so it's become hard to catch a whiff of it.

Their scent is of stewed apples. If you prune them pretty hard each year, they will be making new growth right through the summer and into autumn, and it is the young foliage that gives off the strongest aroma.

The day would start with thick, heavy mist, and 7am was (and will for weeks remain) ideal for going into the garden. At that time, scents are heaviest on the air. You move from the orbit of one to the next, with scarcely a break between. Take, for instance, the incense rose, Rosa primula , which smells exactly of that. A few years ago, Fergus moved it from where it wasn't doing very well to where it is now extremely happy, but that happens to be eight or so metres from the nearest path, so it's become hard to catch a whiff of it.

      "body": "<p>Beep-beep, beep-beep. Beep-beep. In February this year, Sophie Oliveira, a 28-year-old TV researcher from Leeds, goes to watch a London performance by De La Guarda, the Argentine theatre company-cum-circus show that is said to \"challenge the boundaries between audience and performer\".</p> <p>During the show, a male performer walks into the audience and asks to borrow her mobile phone. She agrees. He makes a call, and then hands the phone back to her. Sophie, curious but apprehensive, sends a text message saying \"Who is this?\" to the number he's just dialled. The reply comes after the show, when she's in the pub; it consists, somewhat unhelpfully, of the words \"alright u tart?!\" It turns out to be the De La Guarda man; he'd called his own phone when he borrowed hers to store her number.</p> <p>\"how do u knw I'm a TART?\" types Sophie, who is up for a laugh.</p> <p>\"i cn sense it frm here. I like that in a woman\" replies the, er, charmer.</p> <p>\"hmmm... what else do u like in a woman?\" she taps - at which point I must draw a discreet veil over an exchange that went from textual to sexual into the small hours.</p> <p>\"Yes, I suppose you could call it text-sex,\" says Sophie, laughing. \"Actually, he did try to call me twice during it, but I just switched him off - I wouldn't have wanted to speak to him. Text-messaging is really different from talking... it's a completely different thing. Messages have got that kind of flirty thing...\"</p> <p>Beep-beep. In April, Mr Balil Patel, an IT consultant from Preston, thinks of an answer to a problem that has long vexed British Muslims. The problem concerns the sun; Muslims pray to Mecca when the sun rises and sets, but in Britain it's hard to tell when that happens, because there are few muezzins to alert you to it, it's often too cloudy to see the sun yourself, and you have a busy modern schedule to distract you. Mr Patel checks the sunset time in the morning paper, sets up a group-send on his mobile's messaging function, then, every evening, sends a warning text-message to his friends just before sundown.</p> <p>Beep-beep. During the campaigning for Zimbabwe's constitutional referendum in February, mobile-phone users opposed to Robert Mugabe send a \"VOTE NO\" text message to groups of random numbers. This is one of the few ways to get the anti-Mugabe message across in a mass medium, because opposition parties are little reported or misrepresented in state-controlled newspapers and television. After the referendum, Strive Masiyiwa, the chief executive of Zimbabwe's largest mobile phone network, has to employ bodyguards after he is attacked several times by Mugabe supporters.</p> <p>Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep. People who work in the mobile-phone industry are well-used to high levels of demand for their services, but they have never seen anything like the figures for text-messaging. From an initial total of 40 million in January 1999 - the first month that British users could send them from one network to another - the number of dinky, digital messages of up to 160 characters sent in the UK had risen to 360 million by this April, and May's figure is expected to top 500 million.</p> <p>In other countries, the figures are even higher: the Italians currently send twice the number of text messages that we do, and the Germans three times. The earth's population as a whole sent three billion text messages in December 1999 alone - the last month for which figures are available - and industry observers expect that figure to reach 10 billion by the end of this year.</p> <p>Those observers don't really know who is sending the messages, or what they're sending them for, but they estimate that 10% are work-related (managers telling their travelling salesmen about stock prices, for example, or engineers letting their warehouses know they're running low on components), while the other 90% are the titchy, thumbed-in and beamed-out bulletins, broadsides and billets-doux sent by the rest of us.</p> <p>The people at the companies that make the phones or run the networks are excited, bewildered, or both; none of them even imagined text messages becoming this popular, and a few thought they wouldn't catch on at all. Indeed, off the record, some people from the networks will tell you that they underestimated the demand so badly that they can't increase broadcast-capacity fast enough to keep up; they'll tell you that this is why your phone has been flashing those brain-bothering \"network busy\" messages so often in the past 18 months.</p> <p>They tend to explain the appeal in terms of practicality. Nokia's UK business development manager, Mark Squires, thinks it has got a lot to do with cost (you can send a text message anywhere for a trip-to-a-70s-sweetshop-sized 10p), and with what he calls the \"control factor\" (as in, you get to read it if, and when, you want).</p> <p>Ericsson's senior product manager, Colin Ellis, agrees. He also points out that they have made mobile communications accessible to the deaf for the first time, and adds that the popularity \"is also down to them being so discreet and personal; no one need know when you're sending or reading a text message, even if you're in a meeting. And you don't have to use the manual to learn how to do it. We've realised that however good a service is, if people have to read the manual in order to use it, it won't happen.\"</p> <p>But there seems to be something more than practicality about the appeal of text messaging: something that gives them that brown-paper-packages-tied-up-with-string quality, and qualifies them for life's range of small, good things. Text messages are like little sugar-rushes of contact, postcards for the people's cyberspace, the real reason God gave us both thumbs and the capacity for language (alright, alright, I know).</p> <p>What explains it is vague, and hard to pin down; part of it must be that they seem sent to solve so many of our modern manners-conundrums. Such as: what to do when you want to ask someone something without getting sucked into the pleasantries-and-gossip-vortex? Or when you're on the bus and can't wait, but wish to avoid \"I'M ON THE BUS\"-syndrome? Or when you wish to ensure that the forgetful friend you're phoning has the directions to your house written down correctly? There's also the way they pander to the deep-rooted, but rarely acknowledged, human love of making up stupid languages (\"Gr8 2 CU\", etc). And, of course, there's that \"kind of flirty thing\".</p> <p>It is not only anecdotal evidence that suggests people have created a new kind of non-contact foreplay with text-messaging. Last year, 44% of mobile-phone users questioned in a survey for Nokia said that text messages meant they told their partner they loved them more often; 53% used it to apologise after rows; and a saucy 18% suggested they might, ahem, \"make love\" later that evening.</p> <p>From different research, Orange has found that 64% of its customers think that text messages are \"a good way to flirt with people they'd like to know better\". Now, of course, both companies could just be talking up small surveys - it's a good story, after all - but Nokia has acted on its findings, compiling lists of ready-made romantic messages to be stored in phones, thus saving users the effort of making up their own (yes, I know, I know - tell them). And most mobile users will tell you that they like getting it in writing, particularly in those tricky early stages of a relationship.</p> <p>It is, perhaps, surprising that they appeal to men as much as women, given the former's poor reputation regarding regular declarations of affection. As Mark Squires says, in a strange moment of man-to-man intimacy with me at the Mobile Expo 2000 show in Birmingham's NEC, \"Somehow, you can say stuff like 'I love you' easier, can't you? A lot of men can't say it to their girlfriends because it makes them feel... soppy. But they can send it on text message. Men like this just the same as women. There haven't been many things like that, but we do find that, with the modern communications technology market, you can't look for those old divisions and values.\"</p> <p>It might only be because it combines the love letter with gadgetry, but the text message does appear to have encouraged men to write and call more; and, in this respect, it might just be carrying on the good work of its telephonic ancestors. Some commentators in the past have credited the universal adoption of the telephone with making men more willing to talk about their emotions. The emotionally inarticulate apparently find it easier to talk about their feelings if their friend is on the other end of a phone line, while they're in a room on their own; and being able to type it out and send it via radio masts now seems to be helping them feel positively at one with themselves and the world. Beep-beep, mate.</p> <p>Text-messaging's proper name is Short Message Service (commonly referred to as SMS), and you have the European Union to thank for it. In the early 80s, the EU's telephones department rather presciently decided that it needed a system that would work across all its national boundaries, and persuaded engineers from each member-country's major phone company to invent it. Despite the vast comedic potential of this arrangement, the engineers had, by 1992, created a form of radio communication called the Global System for Mobile Communication, or GSM.</p> <p>Because some of the engineers had heard of the internet, and thought that people might want to send messages to it with their phones, they built into the system a facility that allowed users to send a bit of text. The first SMS was sent from a PC to a mobile phone on the Vodafone network in Britain in early 1992, but its development seems to have been something of a just-in-case measure - the GSM engineers didn't even bother to work out how to return messages until after GSM had been put into operation in Europe in the early 90s.</p> <p>In Britain, SMS initially attracted little interest from the networks but, as the competition between them increased, they began half-heartedly promoting text-messaging as an added-value teaser to existing services. Because they would allow it only within their own network, however, it was next-to-useless for most people. The networks now say that technical hitches and difficulties with commercial agreements held them up in making it possible to text-message between them, but you get the impression that few people working there at the time thought SMS would be popular with the public. Some will admit that, originally, they thought mainly of using it to send information to their customers; a public predilection for sending silly 160-letter letters to each other wasn't the sort of \"projection\" that came up at strategy meetings.</p> <p>In Britain, Orange, Cellnet, Vodafone and Mercury One2One finally made it possible to use SMS across different networks in January 1999. Through winter and early spring, take-up was healthy but, in comparison with what was to come, unremarkable - 40 million a month between January and April.</p> <p>Then something started to happen that took the people at the networks by surprise. Pay-as-you-go mobile vouchers, which obviated the need for credit checks and direct debits from bank accounts, were bringing mobile phones to mass-ownership among under-18-year-olds, and for them text-messaging was ideal and instinctive. It was far cheaper than calling; it had a novelty value; it felt natural to a generation that had grown up with email, and you could use it when you weren't supposed to be sending messages, thus annoying adults and teachers alike (text-messaging in schools is now creating a dilemma for teachers; parents insist their children carry phones for personal safety, but the children use them for surreptitious digital-note-sending in lessons. Many schools ban them from desks during lessons, and one private school in Berkshire has just instituted a fine system for anyone caught texting in teaching-time).</p> <p>With pre-pay customers averaging three times more SMS-ing than others, the figures began to rise steeply, hitting 271 million in December. All the networks now agree that the youth market was the \"key driver\" in popularising SMS, and make deeply appreciative statements about \"young people\" and their \"non-technophobia\".</p> <p>\"We're going to see lots of SMS services becoming available,\" says Colin Ellis. \"It's all about the art of the possible. And because youth is all about pushing boundaries and experiment, young people are experts at the art of the possible.\"</p> <p>There used to be a joke in the industry that young people became so fond of SMS because, when they were in nightclubs, say, they found it easier to send and read a message than to hear someone speak. Then someone noticed that there really was a rise in use between 10pm and 2am on Friday and Saturday nights; they're still wondering about that.</p> <p>Whatever; however much, or little, text-messaging is being done on and around the dancefloor, it is clear that it has permeated British youth culture in, it has to be said, some fairly mirth-prompting ways. Pirate radio station DJs in London, for example, can be heard appealing over the airwaves for missives from the \"Text Message Crew\" (and, indeed, \"The Email Massive\"). Details of illegal squat parties are messaged through to caller groups. It was no surprise at all to find Orange sponsoring the 20th anniversary issue of The Face magazine in May this year, and registering its presence in the form of a 12-screen text message (from \"The Big O\") printed on a page.</p> <p>It's all very well bowing to the youth market but, of course, admitting that the kids know what's going on is just the modern, cool way of admitting that you haven't a clue. The truth is that we're in unmapped territory here, and no one knows what people will do with their mobeys. Everyone can see there's a lot of potential for mobile phones, but the industry is realising - partly because the text-message boom took it by surprise - that the psychology of mobile-phone use is unpredictable, and any commercial exploitation of SMS will have to take into account our, well, feelings towards them. From the little research that has been done, we know that we have a more personal, closer reaction to text messages received on a phone than to email on our PC, for example. And that people who message a lot feel unpopular (or, perhaps, suffer \"phoneliness\") if they don't receive any for a while, and will start sending until they get a response.</p> <p>On the other hand, my own research suggests that we don't like strangers invading our personal phone-space. In one week, I sent out 70 messages to numbers chosen at random. The messages were varied: a formal one (\"Hello. This is a msg sent at random by R Benson, a journalist writing abt txt msgs for the Guardian. If you would like to be interviewed abt txt msgs, pls reply\"); a jovial one, sent with a fictitious young friend (Hi!! We're messing about with our phone, we're sending msgs 2 people we don't know to see who's there! Pls reply, love rich and emma); a somewhat embarrassing sci-fi one (\"Is there anybody out there?\" - well, I thought that might catch an X-Files fan, or something); and a simple one (\"Hello stranger\"). I got just one reply, to a \"Hello stranger\". It seemed encouraging at the time, and I thought it might be rather interesting to interview a stranger via text message for this article; but unfortunately, our encounter amounted to the following:</p> <p>Me: \"Hello stranger\"</p> <p>Them (after 10 minutes): \"Well hello to you to\" (sic)</p> <p>Me: \"Thank u! I've been sending msgs 2 strangers to see how long t wd take to get a reply. u r the 1st! don't worry - I am sane. Richard\"</p> <p>Them (after 24 hours): \"Who are you\"?</p> <p>Me: \"My name is Richard Benson. I am a journalist writing a story about text messages. Would you like to be interviewed by text message for the story? It would be anonymous; no need to give names, etc. What do you think?\"</p> <p>Them: Nothing</p> <p>Me (after 24 hours): \"Umm, is that a 'no', then?\"</p> <p>Them: Nothing.</p> <p>And that was it. My conclusions: a) I am no better at chatting people up than I was at 15, b) text-messaging is probably not a good medium for meeting new friends, or for direct marketing, because c) although mobiles are good for concealing one's location and identity, it's still a bit spooky to get messages from someone you don't know.</p> <p>Nevertheless, you probably will be swapping them with strangers soon, because of technology that will allow you to buy things, look things up, and have information sent to you in text-message form. Cellnet's Genie service (which has signed up Balil Patel's mobile minaret) and a company called Sonera Zed are already working in this area (and if you don't think that sounds interesting, you should check their websites: they're good). You can already send graphics, and some networks will supply text-message Christmas cards this year, but that's nothing. In Finland, where the technology is more advanced, you can send a text message to a vending machine, which will deliver, say, a soft drink and put the charge on your phone bill; or order a plane ticket, which comes in the form of a text message, so all you have to do at the check-in desk is show your phone. You'll only have this until 2005, though; by then, \"more advanced data services\" and permanently open internet connections will probably edge it out.</p> <p>Will they have any lasting influence on us? Cd vwls dspr frm th lng'ge altgthr? Or could we end up with a two-tier language system, in which everyday English wd b abbreviated, + cd include numbers + l8rs 2gthr? History offers an interesting parallel that suggests that the answers to these questions could be a partial \"ys\".</p> <p>In the 18th century, a major programme of road-building led to improved transport and mail services throughout England. At the same time, developments in technology made it cheaper to manufacture printing presses, and they became more widely available. As a consequence, more people were able to travel, there was a new, widespread interest in printed communications, and letter-writing became increasingly popular; it even inspired a new literary genre in the epistolary novel, of which Samuel Richardson's Pamela remains the best-known example. All this had a direct impact on language, and the way people used it. The conventions of letter-writing (addresses in the top corners, Dear Sirs and Madams, and so on) were established, for example, and dictionaries were created to standardise spellings between different areas of the country.</p> <p>As the infamous media guru Marshall McLuhan pointed out, changing forms of communication tend to change the way we talk. Sometimes - see the blokes-and-phones theory - they can change the way we act and think, too. It's impossible to know what effect emails and text messages will have on us, but it is clear that they have instigated the biggest boom in \"letter\" writing for 200 years; and while we don't, yet, have a text-message novel, the tight, subject-less sentences and the reproduced emails in Bridget Jones' Diary have at least a touch of the digital missives.</p> <p>Mike Short, the chairman of the GSM Association's Mobile Data Taskforce, believes that text-messaging is part of a epoch-defining shift in the way we communicate with one another, a \"move from a verbal to a visual culture\", as he puts it. That seems a rather grand claim to make on its behalf, but then, if you're not sure what's happening, you might as well try to sound excited about it.</p> <p>The rest of us don't know so much about that, but will carry on using SMS because, of all the clever services and bits of information the techies find to give us, our favourites are the ones that let us talk to each other and make each other laugh. And because, as all good text-maniacs know, when you're dialling, the whole world :-)s with you. Beep-beep</p>",

In February this year, Sophie Oliveira, a 28-year-old TV researcher from Leeds, goes to watch a London performance by De La Guarda, the Argentine theatre company-cum-circus show that is said to \"challenge the boundaries between audience and performer\". During the show, a male performer walks into the audience and asks to borrow her mobile phone. She agrees. He makes a call, and then hands the phone back to her. Sophie, curious but apprehensive, sends a text message saying \"Who is this?\" to the number he's just dialled. The reply comes after the show, when she's in the pub; it consists, somewhat unhelpfully, of the words \"alright u tart?!\" It turns out to be the De La Guarda man; he'd called his own phone when he borrowed hers to store her number. \"how do u knw I'm a TART?\" types Sophie, who is up for a laugh. \"i cn sense it frm here. I like that in a woman\" replies the, er, charmer. \"hmmm... what else do u like in a woman?\" she taps - at which point I must draw a discreet veil over an exchange that went from textual to sexual into the small hours. \"Yes, I suppose you could call it text-sex,\" says Sophie, laughing. \"Actually, he did try to call me twice during it, but I just switched him off - I wouldn't have wanted to speak to him. Text-messaging is really different from talking... it's a completely different thing. Messages have got that kind of flirty thing...\" Beep-beep. In April, Mr Balil Patel, an IT consultant from Preston, thinks of an answer to a problem that has long vexed British Muslims. The problem concerns the sun; Muslims pray to Mecca when the sun rises and sets, but in Britain it's hard to tell when that happens, because there are few muezzins to alert you to it, it's often too cloudy to see the sun yourself, and you have a busy modern schedule to distract you. Mr Patel checks the sunset time in the morning paper, sets up a group-send on his mobile's messaging function, then, every evening, sends a warning text-message to his friends just before sundown. Beep-beep. During the campaigning for Zimbabwe's constitutional referendum in February, mobile-phone users opposed to Robert Mugabe send a \"VOTE NO\" text message to groups of random numbers. This is one of the few ways to get the anti-Mugabe message across in a mass medium, because opposition parties are little reported or misrepresented in state-controlled newspapers and television. After the referendum, Strive Masiyiwa, the chief executive of Zimbabwe's largest mobile phone network, has to employ bodyguards after he is attacked several times by Mugabe supporters. Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep. People who work in the mobile-phone industry are well-used to high levels of demand for their services, but they have never seen anything like the figures for text-messaging. From an initial total of 40 million in January 1999 - the first month that British users could send them from one network to another - the number of dinky, digital messages of up to 160 characters sent in the UK had risen to 360 million by this April, and May's figure is expected to top 500 million. In other countries, the figures are even higher: the Italians currently send twice the number of text messages that we do, and the Germans three times. The earth's population as a whole sent three billion text messages in December 1999 alone - the last month for which figures are available - and industry observers expect that figure to reach 10 billion by the end of this year. Those observers don't really know who is sending the messages, or what they're sending them for, but they estimate that 10% are work-related (managers telling their travelling salesmen about stock prices, for example, or engineers letting their warehouses know they're running low on components), while the other 90% are the titchy, thumbed-in and beamed-out bulletins, broadsides and billets-doux sent by the rest of us. The people at the companies that make the phones or run the networks are excited, bewildered, or both; none of them even imagined text messages becoming this popular, and a few thought they wouldn't catch on at all. Indeed, off the record, some people from the networks will tell you that they underestimated the demand so badly that they can't increase broadcast-capacity fast enough to keep up; they'll tell you that this is why your phone has been flashing those brain-bothering \"network busy\" messages so often in the past 18 months. They tend to explain the appeal in terms of practicality. Nokia's UK business development manager, Mark Squires, thinks it has got a lot to do with cost (you can send a text message anywhere for a trip-to-a-70s-sweetshop-sized 10p), and with what he calls the \"control factor\" (as in, you get to read it if, and when, you want). Ericsson's senior product manager, Colin Ellis, agrees. He also points out that they have made mobile communications accessible to the deaf for the first time, and adds that the popularity \"is also down to them being so discreet and personal; no one need know when you're sending or reading a text message, even if you're in a meeting. And you don't have to use the manual to learn how to do it. We've realised that however good a service is, if people have to read the manual in order to use it, it won't happen.\" But there seems to be something more than practicality about the appeal of text messaging: something that gives them that brown-paper-packages-tied-up-with-string quality, and qualifies them for life's range of small, good things. Text messages are like little sugar-rushes of contact, postcards for the people's cyberspace, the real reason God gave us both thumbs and the capacity for language (alright, alright, I know). What explains it is vague, and hard to pin down; part of it must be that they seem sent to solve so many of our modern manners-conundrums. Such as: what to do when you want to ask someone something without getting sucked into the pleasantries-and-gossip-vortex? Or when you're on the bus and can't wait, but wish to avoid \"I'M ON THE BUS\"-syndrome? Or when you wish to ensure that the forgetful friend you're phoning has the directions to your house written down correctly? There's also the way they pander to the deep-rooted, but rarely acknowledged, human love of making up stupid languages (\"Gr8 2 CU\", etc). And, of course, there's that \"kind of flirty thing\". It is not only anecdotal evidence that suggests people have created a new kind of non-contact foreplay with text-messaging. Last year, 44% of mobile-phone users questioned in a survey for Nokia said that text messages meant they told their partner they loved them more often; 53% used it to apologise after rows; and a saucy 18% suggested they might, ahem, \"make love\" later that evening. From different research, Orange has found that 64% of its customers think that text messages are \"a good way to flirt with people they'd like to know better\". Now, of course, both companies could just be talking up small surveys - it's a good story, after all - but Nokia has acted on its findings, compiling lists of ready-made romantic messages to be stored in phones, thus saving users the effort of making up their own (yes, I know, I know - tell them).

Mike Short, the chairman of the GSM Association's Mobile Data Taskforce, believes that text-messaging is part of a epoch-defining shift in the way we communicate with one another, a \"move from a verbal to a visual culture\", as he puts it. That seems a rather grand claim to make on its behalf, but then, if you're not sure what's happening, you might as well try to sound excited about it. The rest of us don't know so much about that, but will carry on using SMS because, of all the clever services and bits of information the techies find to give us, our favourites are the ones that let us talk to each other and make each other laugh. And because, as all good text-maniacs know, when you're dialling, the whole world :-)s with you. Beep-beep",

      "body": "<p>Soon after The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was published in 1979, Douglas Adams was invited to sign copies at a small science fiction bookshop in Soho. As he drove there some sort of demonstration slowed his progress. \"There was a traffic jam and crowds of people everywhere,\" he recalls. It wasn't until he had pushed his way inside that Adams realised the crowds were there for him. Next day his publisher called to say he was number one in the Sunday Times best seller list and his life changed forever. \"It was like being helicoptered to the top of Mount Everest,\" he says, \"or having an orgasm without the foreplay.\" </p> <p>Hitchhiker had already been a cult radio show and went on both television and the stage. It expanded into four more books that sold over 14m copies world-wide. There were records and computer games and now, after 20 years of Hollywood prevarication, it is as close as it's ever been to becoming a movie. </p> <p>The story itself begins on earth with mild-mannered suburbanite Arthur Dent trying to stop the council demolishing his house to build a bypass. It moves into space when his friend, Ford Prefect - some have seen him as Virgil to Dent's Dante - reveals himself as a representative of the planet Betelgeuse and informs Arthur that the earth itself is about to be demolished to make way for a hyperspace express route. They hitch a ride on a Vogon spaceship and begin to use the guide itself; a usually reliable repository of all knowledge about life, the universe and everything. </p> <p>Adams's creativity and idiosyncratic intergalactic humour have had a pervasive cultural influence. The phrase \"hitchhiker's guide to...\" quickly became common parlance and there have been numerous copycat spoof sci-fi books and TV series. His Babel fish - a small fish you can place in your ear to translate any speech into your own language - has been adopted as the name of a translation device on an internet search engine. He followed up his success with several other novels as well as a television programme, book and CD-rom on endangered species. He has founded a dot.com company, <a href=\"http://www.H2G2\" target=\"_new\">H2G2</a>, that has recently taken the idea of the guide full circle by launching a service that promises real information on life, the universe and everything via your mobile phone. </p> <p>Much of his wealth seems to have been spent fuelling his passion for technology but he has never really been the nerdy science-fiction type. He is relaxed, gregarious and a solidly built 2m tall. In fact, he has more the air of those English public schoolboys who became rock stars in the 1970s; he once did play guitar on stage at Earls Court with his mates Pink Floyd. In a nicely flash touch, instead of producing a passport-size photo of his daughter out of his wallet, he opens up his impressively powerful laptop, where, after a bit of fiddling about, Polly Adams, aged five, appears in pop video spoof featuring a cameo appearance by another mate, John Cleese. </p> <p>So this is what his life turned into; money, A-list friends, and nice toys. Looking at the bare facts of his cv - boarding school, Cambridge Footlights and the BBC - it seems at first sight no surprise. But his has not been an entirely straightforward journey along well-worn establishment tracks. </p> <p>Douglas Noel Adams was born in Cambridge in 1952. One of his many stock gags is that he was DNA in Cambridge nine months before Crick and Watson made their discovery. His mother, Janet, was a nurse at Addenbrooke's hospital and his father, Christopher, had been a teacher; he went on to became a postgraduate theology student, probation officer, and finally a management consultant, which was \"a very, very peculiar move\", claims Adams. \"Anyone who knew my father will tell you that management was not something he knew very much about.\" </p> <p>The family were \"fairly hard up\" and left Cambridge six months after Douglas was born to live in various homes on the fringes of east London. When Adams he was five his parents divorced. \"It's amazing the degree to which children treat their own lives as normal,\" he says. \"But of course it was difficult. My parents divorced when it wasn't remotely as common as it is now, and to be honest I have scant memory of anything before I was five. I don't think it was a great time, one way or another.\" </p> <p>After the break-up Douglas and his younger sister went with their mother to Brentwood in Essex where she ran a hostel for sick animals. He saw his by now compara tively wealthy father at weekends, which was a source of confusion and tension. To add to the complications several step-siblings emerged as his parents remarried. Adams has said that while he accepted all this as normal on one level he did, \"behave oddly as a result\", and remembers himself as a twitchy and somewhat strange child. For a time his teachers thought he was educationally subnormal, but by the time he went to the direct grant Brentwood Prep School he was regarded as extremely bright. </p> <p>The school boasts a remarkably diverse list of post-war alumni: Hardy Amies, the disgraced historian David Irving, TV presenter Noel Edmonds, home secretary Jack Straw and Times editor Peter Stothard were all there before Adams, while comedians Griff Rhys Jones and Keith Allen were a few years behind him. There are four old boys - two Labour and two Conservative - in the current House of Commons. In a scene which now seems rather incongruous in the light of Keith Allen's hard-living image, it was Adams who helped the seven-year-old Allen with his piano lessons. </p> <p>When Adams was 13 his mother remarried and moved to Dorset and Adams changed from being a day boy to a boarder. It appears to have been an entirely beneficial experience. \"Whenever I left school at four in the afternoon I always used to look at what the boarders were doing rather wistfully,\" he says. \"They seemed to be having a good time and, in fact, I thoroughly enjoyed boarding. There is a piece of me that likes to fondly imagine my maverick and rebellious nature. But more accurately I like to have a nice and cosy institution that I can rub up against a little bit. There is nothing better than a few constraints you can comfortably kick against.\" </p> <p>Adams ascribes the quality of his education to being taught by some, \"very good, committed, obsessed and charismatic people\". At a recent party in London he confronted Jack Straw on New Labour's apparent antipathy to direct grant schools, on the basis that it had done neither of them much harm. </p> <p>Frank Halford was a master at the school and remembers Adams as, \"very tall even then, and popular. He wrote an end of term play when Doctor Who had just started on television. He called it Doctor Which.\" Many years later Adams did write scripts for Doctor Who. He describes Halford as an inspirational teacher who is still a support. \"He once gave me 10 out of 10 for a story, which was the only time he did throughout his long school career. And even now, when I have a dark night of the soul as a writer and think that I can't do this anymore, the thing that I reach for is not the fact that I have had best-sellers or huge advances. It is the fact that Frank Halford once gave me 10 out of 10, and at some fundamental level I must be able to do it.\" </p> <p>It seems from the beginning he had a facility for turning his writing into cash. He sold some short, \"almost haiku-length\", stories to the Eagle comic and received 10 shillings. \"You could practically buy a yacht for 10 shillings then,\" he laughs. But his real interest was music. He learned to play the guitar by copying note for note the intricate finger-picking patterns on an early Paul Simon album. He now has a huge collection of left-handed electric guitars but admits that he's, \"really a folkie at heart. Even with Pink Floyd on stage I played a very simple guitar figure from Brain Damage which was in a finger-picking style.\" </p> <p>He grew up in the 60s and the Beatles, \"planted a seed in my head that made it explode. Every nine months there'd be a new album which would be an earth-shattering development from where they were before. We were so obsessed by them that when Penny Lane came out and we hadn't heard it on the radio we beat up this boy who had heard it until he hummed the tune to us. People now ask if Oasis are as good as the Beatles. I don't think they are as good as the Rutles.\" </p> <p>The other key influence was Monty Python. Having listened to mainstream British radio comedy of the 50s he describes it as an \"epiphanous\" moment when he discovered that being funny could be a way in which intelligent people expressed themselves - \"and be very, very silly at the same time\". </p> <p>The logical next step was to go to Cambridge university, \"because I wanted to join Footlights,\" he says. \"I wanted to be a writer-performer like the Pythons. In fact I wanted to be John Cleese and it took me some time to realise that the job was in fact taken.\" </p> <p>At university he quickly abandoned performing - \"I just wasn't reliable\" - and began to write self-confessed Pythonesque sketches. He recalls one about a railway worker who was reprimanded for leaving all the points open on the southern region to prove a point about existentialism; and another about the difficulties in staging the Crawley Paranoid Society AGM. </p> <p>The arts administrator Mary Allen, formerly of the Arts Council and the Royal Opera, was a contemporary at Cambridge and has remained a friend ever since.

Python member Graham Chapman had been impressed by some Footlights sketches and had made contact. When Adams went to see him he was asked, much to his delight, to help out with a script Chapman had to finish that afternoon. \"We ended up working together for about a year. Mostly on a prospective TV series which never made it beyond the pilot.\" Chapman at this time was \"sucking down couple of bottles of gin every day, which obviously gets in the way a bit.\" But Adams believes he was enormously talented. \"He was naturally part of a team and needed other people's discipline to enable his brilliance to work. His strength was flinging something into the mix that would turn it all upside down.\" </p> <p>After splitting up with Chapman, Adams's career stalled badly. He continued to write sketches but was not making anything like a living. \"It turned out I wasn't terribly good at writing sketches. I could never write to order and couldn't really do topical stuff. But occasionally I'd come out with something terrific from left field.\" </p> <p>Geoffrey Perkins, head of comedy at BBC television, was the producer of the radio version of Hitchhiker.

I got the job from an ad in the Evening Standard.\" Griff Rhys Jones did the same job for a while on Adams's recommendation. Adams recalls becoming increasingly depressed as he endured night shifts of sitting outside hotel bedrooms. \"I kept thinking this wasn't how it was supposed to have worked out\". At Christmas he went to visit his mother and stayed there for the next year. </p> <p>He recalls a lot of family worry about what he was going to do, and, while he still sent in the occasional sketch to radio shows, he acknowledges that his confidence was extremely low. Despite his subsequent success and wealth, this propensity to a lack of confidence has continued. \"I have terrible periods of lack of confidence,\" he explains. \"I just don't believe I can do it and no evidence to the contrary will sway me from that view.

You can't fix the weather - you just have to get on with it.\" So has that approach helped him? \"Not necessarily,\" he shrugs. </p> <p>Hitchhiker was the last throw of the dice, but in retrospect the timing was absolutely right. Star Wars had made science fiction vogueish, and the aftermath of Monty Python meant that while a sketch show was out of the question, there was scope to appeal to the same comic sensibility. </p> <p>Python Terry Jones heard the tapes before transmission and remembers being struck by Adams's, \"intellectual approach and strong conceptual ideas. You feel the stuff he is writing has come from a criticism of life, as Matthew Arnold might say. It has a moral basis and a critical basis that has a strong mind behind it. For instance John Cleese has a powerful mind but he is more logical and analytical. Douglas is more quirky and analytical.\" Geoffrey Perkins agrees but remembers there was little grand plan behind the project. \"Douglas went into it with a whole load of ideas but very little notion of what the story would be. He was writing it in an almost Dickensian mode of episodic weekly instalments without quite knowing how it would end.\" </p> <p>By the time the series was aired in 1978, Adams says he had put about nine months solid work into it and he had been paid \u00a31,000. \"There seemed to be quite a long way to go before I broke even,\" so he accepted a producer's job at the BBC but quit six months later when he found himself simultaneously writing a second radio series, the novel, the television series and episodes of Doctor Who. Despite this remarkable workload he was already building a legendary reputation for not writing. \"I love deadlines,\" he has said. \"I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.\" </p> <p>Success only added to his ability to prevaricate. His publishing editor, Sue Freestone, quickly realised that he treated writing as performance art and so she set up her office in his dining room. \"He needs an instant audience to bounce things off but sometimes this can weirdly backfire. </p> <p>\"There was a scene early in one book when he talked about some plates with, very definitely, one banana on each. This was obviously significant so I asked him to explain. But he liked to tease his audience and he said he'd tell me later. We eventually got to the end of the book and I had asked him again, 'OK Douglas, what's with the bananas?'. He looked at me completely blankly. He had forgotten all about the bananas. I still occasionally ask him if he has remembered yet but apparently he hasn't.\" </p> <p>The writer and producer John Lloyd had been a friend and collaborator with Adams since before Hitchhiker. He remembers the \"agonies of indecision and panic\" Adams got into when writing. \"We were on holiday in Corfu with three friends when he was finishing a book and he ended up taking over the whole house. He had a room to write in, a room to sleep in, a room to go to when he couldn't sleep and so on. It didn't occur to him that other people might want a good night's sleep and as well. He goes through life with a brain the size of a planet and often seems to be living on a different one. He is absolutely not a malicious person but when he is in the throes of panic and terror and unable to finish a book everything else pales into insignificance.\" </p> <p>However the work was dragged out, it was extremely popular. The books all became best-sellers and Adams was given an advance of over $2m by his American publishers. He wrote an hilarious spoof dictionary with John Lloyd, The Meaning Of Liff, in which easily recognised concepts such as the feeling you get at four in the afternoon when you haven't got enough done, were given the names of towns - Farnham being the perfect choice for this low-grade depression. In the late 80s he completed two spoof detective novels featuring Dirk Gently. </p> <p>For all his facility with humour, Freestone says she has been touched by how profoundly Adams's work has connected with some readers. \"In Hitchhiker all you have to do to be safe is have your towel with you,\" she explains. \"I heard about this woman who was dying in a hospice who felt she would be fine because she had her towel with her. She had taken Douglas's universe and incorporated it into her own. It embarrassed the hell out of Douglas when he heard about it. But for her it was literally a symbol of safety when embarking on an unknown journey.\" </p> <p>There are serious themes within his work. The second Dirk Gently novel can easily be read as being about people who are homeless, displaced and alienated from society. \"His imagination goes much deeper than just cleverness,\" says Freestone. \"The social criticism is usually buried by the comedy but its there if you want to find it.\" </p> <p>Having been through such a lean period, Adams worked constantly until the mid-90s, when he very deliberately applied the brakes. \"I had got absolutely stuck in the middle of a novel and, although it sounds ungrateful, having to do huge book signings would drive me to angry depressions.\" </p> <p>He says that he still thought of himself as a scriptwriter and only inadvertently found himself as a novelist. \"It sounds absurd but a bit of me felt cheated and it also felt as if I had cheated. And then there is the money cycle. You're paid a lot and you're not happy so the first thing you do is buy stuff that you don't want or need - for which you need more money.\" </p> <p>His financial affairs got into a mess in the 1980s, he says. He won't discuss the details but says that the knock-on effect was considerable, so that everyone assumed he was wealthier than he actually was. It is possible to track the movement of Adams's life even between series one and two of the radio show. In the first there were a lot of jokes about pubs and being without any money. The second had more jokes about expensive restaurants and accountants. </p> <p>\"I felt like a mouse in a wheel,\" he says. \"There was no pleasure coming into the cycle at any point. When you write your first book aged 25 or so you have 25 years of experience, albeit much of it juvenile experience. The second book comes after an extra year sitting in bookshops. Pretty soon you begin to run on empty.\" </p> <p>His response to running out of fuel was to attempt some \"creative crop rotation\". In particular his interest in technology took off, as did a burgeoning passion for environmental issues. In 1990 he wrote Last Chance To See. \"As is the way of these things it was my least successful book but is still the thing I am most proud of.\" </p> <p>The book began when he was sent to Madagascar by a magazine to find a rare type of lemur. He thought would be quite interesting but it turned into a complete revelation. His fascination with ecology led to an interest in evolution. \"I'd been given a thread to pull and following that lead began to open up issues to me that became the object of the greatest fascination.\" A link at the bottom of his emails now directs people to the Dian Fossey Trust, which works to protect gorillas, and Save the Rhino. Adams was also a signatory to the Great Ape Project, which argued for a change of moral status for great apes recognising their rights to \"life, liberty and freedom from torture\". </p> <p>He was a founder member of the team that launched Comic Relief, but he has never been a hair shirt sort of activist. The parties he held at his Islington home would feature music by various legendary rock stars - Gary Brooker of Procol Harum once sang the whole of Whiter Shade Of Pale, including all the abandoned verses - and were peopled by media aristocracy and hi-tech billionaires. Slightly less orthodoxly - for an enthusiastic, almost evangelical, atheist - he would also host carol services every Christmas. </p> <p>\"As a child I was an active Christian. I used to love the school choir and remember the carol service as always such an emotional thing.\" He adds Bach to the Beatles and the Pythons in his pantheon of influences, but how does this square with his passionate atheism? \"Life is full of things that move or affect you in one way or another,\" he explains. \"The fact that I think Bach was mistaken doesn't alter the fact that I think the B minor mass is one of the great pinnacles of human achievement. It still absolutely moves me to tears to hear it. I find the whole business of religion profoundly interesting. But it does mystify me that otherwise intelligent people take it seriously.\" </p> <p>This attachment to traditional structures, if not traditional beliefs, is carried over in the fact that his daughter, Polly, who was born in 1994, has four non-Godparents. Mary Allen is one of them and it was she who introduced Adams to his wife, the barrister Jane Belson. Allen says: \"In the early 80s Douglas was going through some writing crisis and was ringing me every day. I eventually asked him whether he was lonely. It seemed that he was so we decided he needed someone to share his huge flat. Jane moved in.\" After several false starts they married in 1991 and lived in Islington until last year, when the family moved to Santa Barbara. </p> <p>Adams says the initial move was harder than he expected. \"I've only recently understood how opposed to the move my wife was.\" He now says he would recommend it to anyone \"in the depths of middle age just upping sticks and going somewhere else. You re-invent your life and start again. It is invigorating.\" </p> <p>His role in his dot.com business fits into this sense of invigoration. His job title is chief fantasist. \"I've never thought of myself in the role of a predictive science fiction writer, I was never an Arthur C Clarke wannabe. The Guide was a narrative device for absorbing all those ideas that spark off the flywheel, but it has turned out to be a very good idea. But it's early days,\" he warns. \"We're still in a swimming pool and there is an ocean out there.\" </p> <p>Other new ventures are a novel - eight years late and counting - talk of a Dirk Gently film, the H2G2 web-site and an e-novel. \"I've been talking about how electronic books will come and how important they will be, and all of a sudden Stephen King publishes one. I feel a complete idiot as it should have been me.\" </p> <p>The film project has been \"20 years of constipation\", and he likens the Hollywood process to, \"trying to grill a steak by having a succession of people coming into the room and breathing on it\". He is surprisingly enthusiastic about this apparently antique art form. \"With new, more immature, technologies there is a danger in getting excited about all the ways you can push them forward at the expense of what you want to say. It is therefore rewarding to work in a medium where you don't have to solve those problems because it is a mature medium.\" </p> <p>After such a long fallow period he wisely notes that many of these new projects and ideas will fall by the wayside. \"But I've been out of the mainstream of novel writing for several years and I really needed to take that break. I've been thinking hard and thinking creatively about a whole load of stuff that is not novel writing. As opposed to running on empty it now feels like the tank is full again.\" </p> <p><strong>Life at a glance: Douglas Noel Adams </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> March 11 1952, Cambridge. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Brentwood school, Essex; St John's College, Cambridge. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> 1991 Jane Belson (one daughter, Polly, 1994). </p> <p><strong>Career: </strong>1974-8 radio and television writer; 1978 BBC radio producer. </p> <p><strong> Some scripts:</strong> The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy 1978 and 1980 (radio), 1981(television). </p> <p><strong> Games:</strong> The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy 1984; Bureaucracy 1987; Starship Titanic 1997. </p> <p><strong> Books: </strong> The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy 1979; The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe 1980; Life The Universe And Everything 1982; The Meaning Of Liff (with John Lloyd) 1983; So Long And Thanks For All The Fish 1984; Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency 1987; The Long Dark Tea-time Of The Soul 1988; Last Chance To See 1990; Mostly Harmless 1992</p>",

      "bodyText": "Soon after The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was published in 1979, Douglas Adams was invited to sign copies at a small science fiction bookshop in Soho. As he drove there some sort of demonstration slowed his progress. \"There was a traffic jam and crowds of people everywhere,\" he recalls. It wasn't until he had pushed his way inside that Adams realised the crowds were there for him. Next day his publisher called to say he was number one in the Sunday Times best seller list and his life changed forever. \"It was like being helicoptered to the top of Mount Everest,\" he says, \"or having an orgasm without the foreplay.\" Hitchhiker had already been a cult radio show and went on both television and the stage. It expanded into four more books that sold over 14m copies world-wide. There were records and computer games and now, after 20 years of Hollywood prevarication, it is as close as it's ever been to becoming a movie. The story itself begins on earth with mild-mannered suburbanite Arthur Dent trying to stop the council demolishing his house to build a bypass. It moves into space when his friend, Ford Prefect - some have seen him as Virgil to Dent's Dante - reveals himself as a representative of the planet Betelgeuse and informs Arthur that the earth itself is about to be demolished to make way for a hyperspace express route. They hitch a ride on a Vogon spaceship and begin to use the guide itself; a usually reliable repository of all knowledge about life, the universe and everything. Adams's creativity and idiosyncratic intergalactic humour have had a pervasive cultural influence. The phrase \"hitchhiker's guide to...\" quickly became common parlance and there have been numerous copycat spoof sci-fi books and TV series. His Babel fish - a small fish you can place in your ear to translate any speech into your own language - has been adopted as the name of a translation device on an internet search engine. He followed up his success with several other novels as well as a television programme, book and CD-rom on endangered species. He has founded a dot.com company, H2G2, that has recently taken the idea of the guide full circle by launching a service that promises real information on life, the universe and everything via your mobile phone. Much of his wealth seems to have been spent fuelling his passion for technology but he has never really been the nerdy science-fiction type. He is relaxed, gregarious and a solidly built 2m tall. In fact, he has more the air of those English public schoolboys who became rock stars in the 1970s; he once did play guitar on stage at Earls Court with his mates Pink Floyd. In a nicely flash touch, instead of producing a passport-size photo of his daughter out of his wallet, he opens up his impressively powerful laptop, where, after a bit of fiddling about, Polly Adams, aged five, appears in pop video spoof featuring a cameo appearance by another mate, John Cleese. So this is what his life turned into; money, A-list friends, and nice toys. Looking at the bare facts of his cv - boarding school, Cambridge Footlights and the BBC - it seems at first sight no surprise. But his has not been an entirely straightforward journey along well-worn establishment tracks. Douglas Noel Adams was born in Cambridge in 1952. One of his many stock gags is that he was DNA in Cambridge nine months before Crick and Watson made their discovery. His mother, Janet, was a nurse at Addenbrooke's hospital and his father, Christopher, had been a teacher; he went on to became a postgraduate theology student, probation officer, and finally a management consultant, which was \"a very, very peculiar move\", claims Adams. \"Anyone who knew my father will tell you that management was not something he knew very much about.\" The family were \"fairly hard up\" and left Cambridge six months after Douglas was born to live in various homes on the fringes of east London. When Adams he was five his parents divorced. \"It's amazing the degree to which children treat their own lives as normal,\" he says. \"But of course it was difficult. My parents divorced when it wasn't remotely as common as it is now, and to be honest I have scant memory of anything before I was five. I don't think it was a great time, one way or another.\" After the break-up Douglas and his younger sister went with their mother to Brentwood in Essex where she ran a hostel for sick animals. He saw his by now compara tively wealthy father at weekends, which was a source of confusion and tension. To add to the complications several step-siblings emerged as his parents remarried. Adams has said that while he accepted all this as normal on one level he did, \"behave oddly as a result\", and remembers himself as a twitchy and somewhat strange child. For a time his teachers thought he was educationally subnormal, but by the time he went to the direct grant Brentwood Prep School he was regarded as extremely bright. The school boasts a remarkably diverse list of post-war alumni: Hardy Amies, the disgraced historian David Irving, TV presenter Noel Edmonds, home secretary Jack Straw and Times editor Peter Stothard were all there before Adams, while comedians Griff Rhys Jones and Keith Allen were a few years behind him. There are four old boys - two Labour and two Conservative - in the current House of Commons. In a scene which now seems rather incongruous in the light of Keith Allen's hard-living image, it was Adams who helped the seven-year-old Allen with his piano lessons. When Adams was 13 his mother remarried and moved to Dorset and Adams changed from being a day boy to a boarder. It appears to have been an entirely beneficial experience. \"Whenever I left school at four in the afternoon I always used to look at what the boarders were doing rather wistfully,\" he says. \"They seemed to be having a good time and, in fact, I thoroughly enjoyed boarding. There is a piece of me that likes to fondly imagine my maverick and rebellious nature. But more accurately I like to have a nice and cosy institution that I can rub up against a little bit. There is nothing better than a few constraints you can comfortably kick against.\" Adams ascribes the quality of his education to being taught by some, \"very good, committed, obsessed and charismatic people\". At a recent party in London he confronted Jack Straw on New Labour's apparent antipathy to direct grant schools, on the basis that it had done neither of them much harm. Frank Halford was a master at the school and remembers Adams as, \"very tall even then, and popular. He wrote an end of term play when Doctor Who had just started on television. He called it Doctor Which.\" Many years later Adams did write scripts for Doctor Who. He describes Halford as an inspirational teacher who is still a support. \"He once gave me 10 out of 10 for a story, which was the only time he did throughout his long school career. And even now, when I have a dark night of the soul as a writer and think that I can't do this anymore, the thing that I reach for is not the fact that I have had best-sellers or huge advances. It is the fact that Frank Halford once gave me 10 out of 10, and at some fundamental level I must be able to do it.\" It seems from the beginning he had a facility for turning his writing into cash. He sold some short, \"almost haiku-length\", stories to the Eagle comic and received 10 shillings. \"You could practically buy a yacht for 10 shillings then,\" he laughs. But his real interest was music. He learned to play the guitar by copying note for note the intricate finger-picking patterns on an early Paul Simon album. He now has a huge collection of left-handed electric guitars but admits that he's, \"really a folkie at heart. Even with Pink Floyd on stage I played a very simple guitar figure from Brain Damage which was in a finger-picking style.\" He grew up in the 60s and the Beatles, \"planted a seed in my head that made it explode. Every nine months there'd be a new album which would be an earth-shattering development from where they were before. We were so obsessed by them that when Penny Lane came out and we hadn't heard it on the radio we beat up this boy who had heard it until he hummed the tune to us. People now ask if Oasis are as good as the Beatles. I don't think they are as good as the Rutles.\" The other key influence was Monty Python. Having listened to mainstream British radio comedy of the 50s he describes it as an \"epiphanous\" moment when he discovered that being funny could be a way in which intelligent people expressed themselves - \"and be very, very silly at the same time\". The logical next step was to go to Cambridge university, \"because I wanted to join Footlights,\" he says. \"I wanted to be a writer-performer like the Pythons. In fact I wanted to be John Cleese and it took me some time to realise that the job was in fact taken.\" At university he quickly abandoned performing - \"I just wasn't reliable\" - and began to write self-confessed Pythonesque sketches. He recalls one about a railway worker who was reprimanded for leaving all the points open on the southern region to prove a point about existentialism; and another about the difficulties in staging the Crawley Paranoid Society AGM. The arts administrator Mary Allen, formerly of the Arts Council and the Royal Opera, was a contemporary at Cambridge and has remained a friend ever since. She performed his material and remembers him as, \"always noticed even amongst a very tal ented group of people. Douglas's material was very quirky and individualistic. You had to suit it and it had to suit you. Even in short sketches he created a weird world.\" Adams says, \"I did have something of a guilt thing about reading English. I thought I should have done something useful and challenging. But while I was whingeing I also relished the chance not to do very much.\" Even his essays were full of jokes. \"If I had known then what I know now I would have done biology or zoology. At the time I had no idea that was an interesting subject but now I think it is the most interesting subject in the world.\" Other contemporaries included the lawyer and TV presenter Clive Anderson. The culture secretary Chris Smith was president of the union. Adams used to do warm-up routines for debates, not because of any political interest, \"I was just looking for any where I could do gags. It is very strange seeing these people dotted around the public landscape now. My contemporaries are starting to win lifetime achievement awards, which obviously makes one feel nervous.\" After university Adams got the chance to work with one of his heroes. Python member Graham Chapman had been impressed by some Footlights sketches and had made contact. When Adams went to see him he was asked, much to his delight, to help out with a script Chapman had to finish that afternoon. \"We ended up working together for about a year. Mostly on a prospective TV series which never made it beyond the pilot.\" Chapman at this time was \"sucking down couple of bottles of gin every day, which obviously gets in the way a bit.\" But Adams believes he was enormously talented. \"He was naturally part of a team and needed other people's discipline to enable his brilliance to work. His strength was flinging something into the mix that would turn it all upside down.\" After splitting up with Chapman, Adams's career stalled badly. He continued to write sketches but was not making anything like a living. \"It turned out I wasn't terribly good at writing sketches. I could never write to order and couldn't really do topical stuff. But occasionally I'd come out with something terrific from left field.\" Geoffrey Perkins, head of comedy at BBC television, was the producer of the radio version of Hitchhiker. He remembers first coming across Adams when he directed a Footlights show. \"He was being heckled by a cast member, and then he fell into a chair. I next came across him when he was trying to write sketches for the radio show Weekending, then regarded as the big training ground for writers. Douglas was one of those writers who honourably failed to get anywhere with Weekending. It put a premium on people who could write things that lasted 30 seconds and Douglas was incapable of writing a single sentence that lasted less than 30 seconds.\" With his dreams of being a writer crumbling around him Adams took a series of bizarre jobs including working as a chicken-shed cleaner and as a bodyguard to the ruling family of Qatar. \"I think the security firm must have been desperate. I got the job from an ad in the Evening Standard.\" Griff Rhys Jones did the same job for a while on Adams's recommendation. Adams recalls becoming increasingly depressed as he endured night shifts of sitting outside hotel bedrooms. \"I kept thinking this wasn't how it was supposed to have worked out\". At Christmas he went to visit his mother and stayed there for the next year. He recalls a lot of family worry about what he was going to do, and, while he still sent in the occasional sketch to radio shows, he acknowledges that his confidence was extremely low. Despite his subsequent success and wealth, this propensity to a lack of confidence has continued. \"I have terrible periods of lack of confidence,\" he explains. \"I just don't believe I can do it and no evidence to the contrary will sway me from that view. I briefly did therapy but after a while I realised it is just like a farmer complaining about the weather. You can't fix the weather - you just have to get on with it.\" So has that approach helped him? \"Not necessarily,\" he shrugs. Hitchhiker was the last throw of the dice, but in retrospect the timing was absolutely right. Star Wars had made science fiction vogueish, and the aftermath of Monty Python meant that while a sketch show was out of the question, there was scope to appeal to the same comic sensibility. Python Terry Jones heard the tapes before transmission and remembers being struck by Adams's, \"intellectual approach and strong conceptual ideas. You feel the stuff he is writing has come from a criticism of life, as Matthew Arnold might say. It has a moral basis and a critical basis that has a strong mind behind it.

She had taken Douglas's universe and incorporated it into her own. It embarrassed the hell out of Douglas when he heard about it. But for her it was literally a symbol of safety when embarking on an unknown journey.\" There are serious themes within his work. The second Dirk Gently novel can easily be read as being about people who are homeless, displaced and alienated from society. \"His imagination goes much deeper than just cleverness,\" says Freestone. \"The social criticism is usually buried by the comedy but its there if you want to find it.\" Having been through such a lean period, Adams worked constantly until the mid-90s, when he very deliberately applied the brakes. \"I had got absolutely stuck in the middle of a novel and, although it sounds ungrateful, having to do huge book signings would drive me to angry depressions.\" He says that he still thought of himself as a scriptwriter and only inadvertently found himself as a novelist. \"It sounds absurd but a bit of me felt cheated and it also felt as if I had cheated. And then there is the money cycle. You're paid a lot and you're not happy so the first thing you do is buy stuff that you don't want or need - for which you need more money.\" His financial affairs got into a mess in the 1980s, he says. He won't discuss the details but says that the knock-on effect was considerable, so that everyone assumed he was wealthier than he actually was. It is possible to track the movement of Adams's life even between series one and two of the radio show. In the first there were a lot of jokes about pubs and being without any money. The second had more jokes about expensive restaurants and accountants. \"I felt like a mouse in a wheel,\" he says. \"There was no pleasure coming into the cycle at any point. When you write your first book aged 25 or so you have 25 years of experience, albeit much of it juvenile experience. The second book comes after an extra year sitting in bookshops. Pretty soon you begin to run on empty.\" His response to running out of fuel was to attempt some \"creative crop rotation\". In particular his interest in technology took off, as did a burgeoning passion for environmental issues. In 1990 he wrote Last Chance To See. \"As is the way of these things it was my least successful book but is still the thing I am most proud of.\" The book began when he was sent to Madagascar by a magazine to find a rare type of lemur. He thought would be quite interesting but it turned into a complete revelation. His fascination with ecology led to an interest in evolution. \"I'd been given a thread to pull and following that lead began to open up issues to me that became the object of the greatest fascination.\" A link at the bottom of his emails now directs people to the Dian Fossey Trust, which works to protect gorillas, and Save the Rhino. Adams was also a signatory to the Great Ape Project, which argued for a change of moral status for great apes recognising their rights to \"life, liberty and freedom from torture\". He was a founder member of the team that launched Comic Relief, but he has never been a hair shirt sort of activist. The parties he held at his Islington home would feature music by various legendary rock stars - Gary Brooker of Procol Harum once sang the whole of Whiter Shade Of Pale, including all the abandoned verses - and were peopled by media aristocracy and hi-tech billionaires. Slightly less orthodoxly - for an enthusiastic, almost evangelical, atheist - he would also host carol services every Christmas. \"As a child I was an active Christian. I used to love the school choir and remember the carol service as always such an emotional thing.\" He adds Bach to the Beatles and the Pythons in his pantheon of influences, but how does this square with his passionate atheism? \"Life is full of things that move or affect you in one way or another,\" he explains. \"The fact that I think Bach was mistaken doesn't alter the fact that I think the B minor mass is one of the great pinnacles of human achievement. It still absolutely moves me to tears to hear it. I find the whole business of religion profoundly interesting. But it does mystify me that otherwise intelligent people take it seriously.\" This attachment to traditional structures, if not traditional beliefs, is carried over in the fact that his daughter, Polly, who was born in 1994, has four non-Godparents. Mary Allen is one of them and it was she who introduced Adams to his wife, the barrister Jane Belson. Allen says: \"In the early 80s Douglas was going through some writing crisis and was ringing me every day. I eventually asked him whether he was lonely. It seemed that he was so we decided he needed someone to share his huge flat. Jane moved in.\" After several false starts they married in 1991 and lived in Islington until last year, when the family moved to Santa Barbara. Adams says the initial move was harder than he expected. \"I've only recently understood how opposed to the move my wife was.\" He now says he would recommend it to anyone \"in the depths of middle age just upping sticks and going somewhere else. You re-invent your life and start again. It is invigorating.\" His role in his dot.com business fits into this sense of invigoration. His job title is chief fantasist. \"I've never thought of myself in the role of a predictive science fiction writer, I was never an Arthur C Clarke wannabe. The Guide was a narrative device for absorbing all those ideas that spark off the flywheel, but it has turned out to be a very good idea. But it's early days,\" he warns. \"We're still in a swimming pool and there is an ocean out there.\" Other new ventures are a novel - eight years late and counting - talk of a Dirk Gently film, the H2G2 web-site and an e-novel. \"I've been talking about how electronic books will come and how important they will be, and all of a sudden Stephen King publishes one. I feel a complete idiot as it should have been me.\" The film project has been \"20 years of constipation\", and he likens the Hollywood process to, \"trying to grill a steak by having a succession of people coming into the room and breathing on it\". He is surprisingly enthusiastic about this apparently antique art form. \"With new, more immature, technologies there is a danger in getting excited about all the ways you can push them forward at the expense of what you want to say. It is therefore rewarding to work in a medium where you don't have to solve those problems because it is a mature medium.\" After such a long fallow period he wisely notes that many of these new projects and ideas will fall by the wayside. \"But I've been out of the mainstream of novel writing for several years and I really needed to take that break. I've been thinking hard and thinking creatively about a whole load of stuff that is not novel writing. As opposed to running on empty it now feels like the tank is full again.\" Life at a glance: Douglas Noel Adams Born: March 11 1952, Cambridge.

They include lentils, chickpeas, kidney, haricot, fava and soya beans, black eye and marrowfat (mushy) peas, all valuable sources of protein, particularly if eaten in conjunction with grains or other carbohydrates (think couscous and chickpeas, rice and peas). They can also, of course, be sprouted. </p> <p>They are one of the oldest foodstuffs, going back to prehistoric times. Fava (broad) beans were used by ancient Egyptians; and lentils, according to the American food writer, Waverley Root, were cultivated in the gardens of King Merodach-Baladan in Babylon, though they appear not to have caused much excitement then, either. Root reports that the Greeks were particularly snooty about lentils: \"Some of their philosophers ate them ostentatiously to demonstrate that they were above worldly pleasures and self-indulgence.\" Hippocrates, apparently, prescribed lentils for liver ailments \"accompanied startlingly with slices of boiled dog\". The word cicer , the Latin for chickpea, was believed to have been derived from one of Roman orator Cicero's ancestors, who had a wart on his face shaped like a chickpea. </p> <p>Things weren't much better in the middle ages. Again according to Root's seminal work, Food, \"the lentil was not only looked down upon as a food unworthy of the solvent, it was also accused of being difficult to digest, and prone to inflame the stomach, weaken eyesight and engender nightmares\". And, according to Harold McGee, St Jerome went as far as to forbid them to the nuns in his charge on the grounds that \"in genitablibus titillationes producunt\". </p> <p>If you want to see pulses viewed more benignly, you have to look to some of the countries to which they eventually spread - Egypt, north Africa, via the Arabs to Spain, then on to South America, where fejoida (that meltingly delicious combination of smoky pork and black beans) is celebrated as the national dish of Brazil. In Spain and Italy, they're taken far more seriously. Look at the River Cafe cookbooks and you'll find sexy, soft-focus photographs of borlotti beans, combined with nothing but fresh herbs and top-quality olive oil. </p> <p>The beauty of beans and other pulses is their \"fantastic ability to soak up flavour\", says Jeremy Lee. \"Combine them with inexpensive cuts of meat such as ham hocks or shoulder of lamb, and you end up with something quite remarkable and splendid.\" They miraculously absorb fat, so that the overall dish seems not remotely greasy, and develop a smooth, silky texture that makes sensational soups and pur\u00e9es (particularly useful at this time of year, when old potatoes are well past their best). They can be cooked and reheated with impunity, kept in the fridge for a couple of days, and are just as useful a standby as a can. </p> <p>Most pulses, with the exception of split peas and lentils, need to be soaked beforehand, preferably overnight. Some books recommend as a short cut boiling them for five minutes, then leaving them to stand for an hour, but I'm not convinced the flavour is as good. You should then drain them, add fresh boiling water, then simmer for one to two hours, depending on the type of pulse (chickpeas generally take longer) and how fresh they are. Beans can get quite heavy and starchy if you don't use enough water. \"You need lots and lots of liquid, just like you do for pasta,\" says Lee. \"Too many people cram beans into the smallest pan imaginable.\" You can use ingredients such as garlic, bayleaves, sage and rosemary to intensify the flavour, but never add salt until they are cooked, otherwise it toughens them up. </p> <p>The key to getting the best out of pulses is to buy the current year's crop, harvested the previous autumn. Like many top London chefs, Lee buys his from Spanish foods importer Brindisa (020-7403 6932), which runs a regular stall in London's Borough Market. Such high-quality beans don't come cheap, however: the Rolls-Royce of the bean world, for instance, the Spanish Judion beans - they are large butter beans harvested individually from the pod - fetch \u00a39.40 a kilo, but that will do for several meals. \"As always, it's about quality,\" says Lee. \"Never buy things that have been hanging around on the back of the shelf.\" </p> <p>These days, of course, pulses are seriously sexy, especially on the restaurant front - there's hardly a menu that doesn't have a pulsating dish. And the praises of pulses as an essential component of your everyday, healthy Mediterranean diet are now quite as vociferous as the voices that condemned them in the past. </p>",

The word cicer , the Latin for chickpea, was believed to have been derived from one of Roman orator Cicero's ancestors, who had a wart on his face shaped like a chickpea. Things weren't much better in the middle ages. Again according to Root's seminal work, Food, \"the lentil was not only looked down upon as a food unworthy of the solvent, it was also accused of being difficult to digest, and prone to inflame the stomach, weaken eyesight and engender nightmares\". And, according to Harold McGee, St Jerome went as far as to forbid them to the nuns in his charge on the grounds that \"in genitablibus titillationes producunt\". If you want to see pulses viewed more benignly, you have to look to some of the countries to which they eventually spread - Egypt, north Africa, via the Arabs to Spain, then on to South America, where fejoida (that meltingly delicious combination of smoky pork and black beans) is celebrated as the national dish of Brazil. In Spain and Italy, they're taken far more seriously. Look at the River Cafe cookbooks and you'll find sexy, soft-focus photographs of borlotti beans, combined with nothing but fresh herbs and top-quality olive oil. The beauty of beans and other pulses is their \"fantastic ability to soak up flavour\", says Jeremy Lee. \"Combine them with inexpensive cuts of meat such as ham hocks or shoulder of lamb, and you end up with something quite remarkable and splendid.\" They miraculously absorb fat, so that the overall dish seems not remotely greasy, and develop a smooth, silky texture that makes sensational soups and pur\u00e9es (particularly useful at this time of year, when old potatoes are well past their best). They can be cooked and reheated with impunity, kept in the fridge for a couple of days, and are just as useful a standby as a can. Most pulses, with the exception of split peas and lentils, need to be soaked beforehand, preferably overnight. Some books recommend as a short cut boiling them for five minutes, then leaving them to stand for an hour, but I'm not convinced the flavour is as good. You should then drain them, add fresh boiling water, then simmer for one to two hours, depending on the type of pulse (chickpeas generally take longer) and how fresh they are. Beans can get quite heavy and starchy if you don't use enough water. \"You need lots and lots of liquid, just like you do for pasta,\" says Lee. \"Too many people cram beans into the smallest pan imaginable.\" You can use ingredients such as garlic, bayleaves, sage and rosemary to intensify the flavour, but never add salt until they are cooked, otherwise it toughens them up. The key to getting the best out of pulses is to buy the current year's crop, harvested the previous autumn. Like many top London chefs, Lee buys his from Spanish foods importer Brindisa (020-7403 6932), which runs a regular stall in London's Borough Market. Such high-quality beans don't come cheap, however: the Rolls-Royce of the bean world, for instance, the Spanish Judion beans - they are large butter beans harvested individually from the pod - fetch \u00a39.40 a kilo, but that will do for several meals. \"As always, it's about quality,\" says Lee. \"Never buy things that have been hanging around on the back of the shelf.\" These days, of course, pulses are seriously sexy, especially on the restaurant front - there's hardly a menu that doesn't have a pulsating dish. And the praises of pulses as an essential component of your everyday, healthy Mediterranean diet are now quite as vociferous as the voices that condemned them in the past.",

Whether for her own good or for ours is a moot point, and too frequently her detractors have confused cleverness with intelligence, or more particularly erudition. Her novels, which range from the elegant entertainments of recent years - Angels and Insects, The Matisse Stories, Elementals - to the massive ongoing project that takes in The Virgin in the Garden and Babel Tower, are fraught with complicated ideas, networks of references and endlessly proliferating interrelated symbols and images.</p> <p>Her most popular work, Possession, juxtaposed the vanities and concealments of modern academia with the \"discovery\" of a Victorian literary mystery, but it was also subtitled \"A Romance\" - a gesture towards the fact that while Byatt may lard her fictions with an enormous array of seemingly extraneous research material, her primary purpose is \"romancing\", or the telling of tales. </p> <p>Possession is partly a satire on the machinations of academia and the rise of the biography industry. The title and opening scenes of her latest novel prepare us for a similar sort of wheeze. Phineas G Nanson (along with Professor Ormerod Goode, Elmer Bole and Scholes Destry-Scholes, the latest in Byatt's long line of ripely named characters) may sound like a Victorian gentleman traveller, but he is deeply rooted in the modern world.</p> <p>We meet him in a seminar on critical theory in which Empedocles finds himself miserably yoked to Lacan; Frankenstein and Freud also make an appearance, with Foucault not far behind. Phineas, all of a sudden, decides he has had enough and must have things, facts, concrete substances. His life as a postmodern scholar is over, and he must find something else to do. </p> <p>His new research topic arrives immediately, partly through luck and partly through the vaguely sinister managing hand of place-names specialist Ormerod Goode, who directs Phineas towards Destry-Scholes's three-volume life of Victorian polymath Elmer Bole. To both modern scholars, Destry-Scholes's achievement is extraordinary: a masterpiece of objectivity, rigour and detachment that exists quite separately, as Phineas carefully points out to us, from the waves of Freudian biography that have since risen up to engulf - and obscure - the form. Phineas is most impressed by the absence of the biographer himself from the work and sets out, in tentative fashion, to research the life of Destry-Scholes, taking especial care to efface himself from the record of his findings. </p> <p>This is the conceit upon which Byatt bases the remainder of this short, exquisitely written novel. Everywhere Phineas looks, he finds both too much and too little. His preliminary researches into Destry-Scholes - which include him staring emptily and cluelessly at a terraced house in Pontefract - reveal only fragments: tantalisingly incomplete notes on the taxonomist Linnaeus, the statistician and eugenicist Francis Galton and the dramatist Ibsen.</p> <p>Each set of notes seems peculiarly connected, with a puzzling emphasis on mysticism and magic, on solitary and whimsical travelling, on the behaviour and classification of animals. Each problem sends Phineas pursuing a different line of enquiry, only to find himself stalled and halted, his \"true intellectual passion for coherence and meanings\" run ragged. All he can be sure of, and that not completely, are the events of his own life - the one thing that he means to keep out of his account. </p> <p>In this ludic scenario, Phineas's hitherto vacant life quickly becomes pregnant with new possibilities, thickening and quickening at every turn. He meets Fulla, a Swedish bee taxonomist who helps him out with Linnaeus and seduces him as they watch stag beetles jousting in Richmond Park. He begins an intense, silent relationship with the \"shockingly beautiful\" Vera Alphage, Destry-Scholes's niece, who takes him into her attic and shows him her uncle's suitcase, crammed full of curiosities (including a trepanning instrument, 366 randomly named marbles and a swathe of spooky composite photographs).</p> <p>He starts work at an alternative travel agent's called Puck's Girdle, encountering there a pair of hedonistic homosexuals who organise fantasy holidays on literary themes and a menacing customer who seems to want him to arrange a tour of paedophile snuff movies. His days become a tangle of indeterminacy, his nights a succession of rampant, stalking nightmares. And his biography of Destry-Scholes comes no closer to its starting point. </p> <p>Byatt has Phineas start his tale as an innocent and end it as a writer, his desperation for facts slowly giving way to his seduction by words. \"I was a failure as a semiotician, I do now see. I may be getting better at writing , now, when it is too late, but then I was slow, I did not read the signs,\" he admits, his tone becoming more conspiratorial as his descriptive writing becomes increasingly metaphorical and sensuous. By the end of the novel, Phineas has abandoned the idea of facts and given himself over to the lure of purple prose, to what Fulla calls \"inauthentic fabrics here suspended from authentic hooks\": indeed, his understanding of what constitutes authenticity has radically changed. </p> <p>So perhaps it would be more accurate to describe Byatt as a sly writer, a mischief maker who revels in the endless potential of pastiche. Possession was a particularly elaborate pastiche, and The Biographer's Tale, despite its comparative brevity, is hardly less cunningly contrived or skilfully executed. For all its obsession with facts, this novel is as much fairy tale as satire, and more dream-like than self-consciously erudite.</p> <p>We do not need Byatt to question the notion of literary purity for us, or to point out that a three-volume biography might be translated into a sketchy patchwork of supposition and confession, or to show us the web of fabrications that underpins all writing, fictional and non-fictional. But her exceptionally subtle understanding of these matters, combined with her densely patterned, beautifully weighted prose, make her a romancer we should be loath to do without.</p>",

Eamonn Sweeney's large, bold second novel sweeps us through four decades, from the 1960s to the recent past, by focusing on the intertwined lives of four men who both trigger and personify the tectonic changes in Irish politics and society, and are ultimately destroyed by them. </p> <p>Raised in a backwoods nowhere with recent memories of the War of Independence, each makes his stellar jump from the rut of rural poverty. Henry Caslin escapes the example of his ruined alcoholic father, betrayed by his wartime comrades, for entrepreneurial sobriety and political ambition; Jimmy Mimnagh leaves 16 siblings and the hearthside goat for London; Father Gerry Lee swells his village with pride when he goes to Rome to study for the priesthood; and Seamus McKeon, to please his printer father, becomes a reporter. This is the generation which grew up in thrall to the church and ended up in Dublin Four with \"the ABCDE people\" (who \"believe in Abortion, Buggery, Contraception, Divorce and Euthanasia\"). </p> <p>The photograph of the title is a seemingly incidental picture of the four at a dance, taken for the local rag; McKeon returns to it 40 years later in an effort to comprehend the private drama played out by the men on the canvas of public life. Through a combination of charisma and ruthlessness, Henry, \"a hobo whose oul fella was a drunk with a kiss-me-arse shop\", has, with Jimmy as his loyal fixer, risen to Taoiseach; McKeon's investigation of Father Lee's paedophilia and the Church's arrogant protection of its more dangerous sons impacts on the government and destroys Henry's career. </p> <p>As a framing device this snapshot is unnecessary, overtly artistic. But Sweeney's authorial control is such that the historical trajectory of his fictional characters' lives, the domino effect of their personal loves and hates, never seems forced. His novel is also an imaginative history of Fianna Fail; he studiously names no names, but slots his Henry with ease into the line of Taoiseachs dominated by \"The Party Founder\" - Eamonn de Valera - who \"made it impossible for the electorate to distinguish between country and Party\", the comfy and ineffectual \"Man With The Pipe\" (Jack Lynch) and the megalomaniac face of the new realpolitik, \"The Tough Guy\", whose gun-running background and corruption echo the scandals of Charles Haughey's political career. It's an ambitious gamble which pays off spectacularly. </p> <p>Similarly, the story of McKeon's pursuit of Father Lee allows Sweeney to dramatise the paedophilia scandal which has driven a schism between the Catholic church and the Irish state. (The church complains that the very term \"paedophile priest\" is proof of the media's anti-religious bias; Sweeney wryly observes that it has more to do with sub-editors' love of alliteration.) \"Try and stop this caper if you can at all\", the priest is told after his first little mishap, as the pattern of relocation from parish to unsuspecting parish and envelopes containing \"small gifts from the church\" begins. From the protectionism of the 1960s to the public outcry of the present, Sweeney never flinches in his portrayal of a man becoming a monster; his narrative voice is charged with psychological insight as well as righteous public anger. </p> <p>Sweeney also traces the encroachment of the North on what used to be called \"the Free State\". Henry crosses the border for the first time as a businessman happy to do a deal with other businessmen who happen to be Northern Protestants (\"the roads were very good... They probably did massive work on roads near the border out of spite\"). But even the address on the contract shows they are worlds apart: </p> <p>\" - No one calls it Londonderry. </p> <p>\"- No one I know calls it anything else. </p> <p>\" - Can you just change it on my copy of the contract. To Derry... I'm being reasonable. What about the Siege of Derry? It's the Siege of Derry ye won.\" </p> <p>Soon more than place names and points of honour are involved. With the dirty protests and hunger strikes of the 1970s, Sweeney identifies one of history's turning points: \"The young men with their shit and starvation had upped the ante and made sure that this story would have an end. There would be some kind of solution.\" </p> <p>As Taoiseach, Henry is involved in the first delicate brokerings of peace; he also oversees the decriminalisation of homosexuality because, as this good but practical Catholic observes, \"the guards have better things to do than go around arresting lads for riding each other\". In politics as in journalism, Sweeney teases out the personal whims and ambitions behind the turns of history. McKeon's most intimate hunger is for the front-page scoop, Henry's for a place in the history books; dazzled by the glare of the future, he is blinded to present danger and lays himself open to attack from those closest to him.</p> <p>As in many narratives of Irish history, at the heart of The Photograph lies betrayal from within. \"It was always your own side that gave it to you.\" This is a theme developed and writ large from Sweeney's dark first novel, Waiting for the Healer, in which a booze-soaked Irish emigrant returns to avenge his murdered brother and finds the killer not, as he assumes, in the sectarian struggle or criminal gang warfare, but within his own clan. </p> <p>The Photograph can, with its hindsight and fact/fiction tricksiness, godlike author and brisk, persuasive style, feel like teleology; it is history portrayed as progress, and also as individual tragedy, in a style speckled with farce. Sweeney has a huge tenderness for his flawed and ambitious protagonists, men left behind by the change they engender, as well as for his vast array of minor characters, brought into richly imagined life with a single sentence. \"Destruction is the best friend of the future\", observes Jimmy.

Stretching away on one side is the ragged arc of a rocky beach, while on the other a hefty limestone bulwark, known as the \"sea wall\" which keeps the writer's tiny whitewashed cottage from being swallowed up by the water.</p> <p>During the day, the landscape is as comfortlessly beautiful as only the West of Ireland can be. But as night begins to fall, it is difficult to escape the jittery feeling of being abandoned on the edge of the earth: \"For the first five or six years we lived here, there was no electricity,\" Healy says, \"so the feeling of isolation was even greater. At that time I was working in the town and by the time I got back here we would already have been plunged into dark winter nights. So, I would light candles and in the envelope of light, I would set about writing poetry.\" </p> <p>On first impression, Dermot Healy's appearance - white beard set against pink capillary-mottled skin - and his rugged way of life is suggestive of a Celtic Hemingway. And if there is a single strain running through his work, from the early collections of stories and poems to his novels The Goat's Song and Sudden Times, it would be that same notion of bristling physicality, not just of the Sligo landscapes that fill his books or even the punishing daily graft of the London building sites he often conjures up, but the essential physicality of language. </p> <p>In The Goat's Song, the story of Catholic writer Jack Ferris's literary quest to win back the love of a flighty Protestant actress, Catherine Adams, much of the narrative is a reconstruction of Catherine's entire life in words, executed with a literal immediacy. In Sudden Times, which deals with a young man's flight from London to Sligo to escape from resurgent events that nearly destroyed him, the plot is slimmed to its skeletal elements, but the language is still hard and real, laid down in lines on the page as if they were heavy, uneven rocks, a sea-wall to protect the characters and the reader from the relentless erosion of the future and the past. </p> <p>None of this is very surprising, given the un-writerly course of Healy's life. He was born in the village of Finea in the north western country of Westmeath in 1947 and moved at a young age to Cavan, a sleepy town close to the northern Irish border. A restless and rebellious student, Healy was expelled from school in his final year and fled a BA course in University College, Dublin after just a year, heading immediately for London: \"I went off and lived on me tod out by Heathrow, where I was working as a security guard. I lived there for two years in lodgings. I never saw anyone that I knew. I bought my first typewriter and started working away.\" </p> <p>This would begin a 15-year London odyssey through various casual jobs - including stints as a building site labourer, carpenter and house painter - and an equally varied selection of dwelling places: \"I lived for two years in a squat in Brixton,\" he says. \"There was a big hole in the ceiling but it was home and I enjoyed it. You were always meeting people from other places, which was great. You do tend to get quite a mixed bag of people in a squat.\" </p> <p>Throughout this time, Healy continued producing poetry and stories, but only secured a publisher after a lucky freelance gig: \"I rang up this publisher and they asked me what I was doing at the time. I told them I was a house-painter, so first of all they had me come round and paint the place. Only later did they consider my work and Banished Misfortune was published.\" </p> <p>Shortly after the publication of this first volume of short stories in 1982, Healy moved to Belfast where would stay for four years, beginning work on A Goat's Song. He then moved to Sligo, working at first on the fishing trawlers: \"You would go out at six in the morning and come back at nine in the evening, so there wasn't much time for writing.\" With the proceeds of his work, he bought the cottage where he now lives with his wife Helen, who works in a bank in Sligo. It was here that Healy completed A Goat's Song (1994), and wrote The Bend for Home (1996) and his current novel Sudden Times, books that have led Roddy Doyle to proclaim him Ireland's greatest writer. </p> <p>The total isolation and often complete solitude has become, for Healy, an important part of the creative process: \"I might be here on me own and I mightn't see anyone except herself [Helen] for weeks. If I've worked well, I go up to the pub at about half six to half seven, and have two pints. So the barman Mick would be the only other person I'd see that day. This could go on for months and months and months, without even so much as a trip into Sligo. It is the only way I can work.\" </p> <p>As always, he complements his the more contemplative side of his life with a strenuous regime of physical exertion. Though, at 52, Healy has had to scale down these activities a little, there is still a large vegetable garden to be tended, donkeys to be cared for and, of course, the sea-wall, which is under constant attack from the pounding forces of the Atlantic Ocean. \"It is a costly thing living here to fight the erosion. The sea is constantly threatening to cut into the coastline and sweep all this away. Every year we have to haul stones up here to repair the damage and plug the holes. It's a full-time job.\"</p>",

Jim Cirni's <strong> The Big Squeeze</strong> (Soho Crime, \u00a37.99), set down the grubby end of the mob, comes out of Damon Runyan sounding like Harvey Keitel in quadraphonic.</p> <p>After 20 years of slog, \"Dip\" Dippolito wants to settle down with his Jewish girlfriend; not as easy as it sounds. Cirni does grainy dialogue, fast, funny and full of good standoffs, and has a handle on everyday improbabilities. Also, he doesn't get cute, sticking to a style with a great sense of illuminated clich\u00e9 - \"He was a fat mess in a chair but still as tough as they come\" - and displaying a craft in which everything is nailed down. Hard to believe, but the author blurb lists his other job as accountant. He must write a great letter. </p> <p>In <strong> Other People's Rules</strong> (HarperCollins, \u00a39.99), Julia Hamilton penetrates that disaster zone known as the upper classes and gives them the withering treatment. Observation rather than narrative drives her story of social hypocrisy, with Hamilton alert to smugness - and its corollary, eating disorders - and \"the white noise of the upper class, a perpetual drone of loaded detail\". Toffs behaving badly is a safe bet; here a Thatcherite aristo fulfils the brief with his taste for teenage girls - including his daughter - generally lording it and getting away with murder. Although it is unlikely that a Catholic earl would also be grand master of the local Masonic lodge. </p> <p>Hard to say why Christopher Reich was drawn to set his story in Germany, 1945 - perhaps it was his name. <strong> The Runner</strong> (Headline, \u00a317.99) promises more than it delivers; the US occupation of Germany in the weeks after the war was far more surreal than Reich allows. His manhunt - ex-cop after nasty Nazi who murdered his brother, a priest - aspires to efficiency rather than achieving it. It is let down by Reich's penchant for over-revved verbs: examples from successive paragraphs include barrelled, careering, shooting, flooding, dashing, threw, coughed, sputtered, grasped, thrust, slammed. </p> <p>Perhaps it went wrong for Thomas \" Silence of the Lambs \" Harris when a clever Oxbridge professor declared that he was writing in the Gothic tradition, at which point the etiolated literary set thought it had better pay attention. Come <strong> Hannibal</strong> (Arrow, \u00a36.99), they duly praised. The funniest reading in this paperback edition are the puffs handed out by the review boys, clapping their hands while running to catch up.</p> <p>To them the book's appeal was its snobbishness, always an Achilles heel. Fine wines, bon vivant, a taste for the exquisite, a prep-school nastiness - reversion to Ian Fleming without the \u00e9lan - they fall for it every time. The perverse act of rehabilitation offered by Harris's \"monster turns hero\" line was either breathtaking or silly, depending on whether you bought the story. If you didn't, then compared to the lean sense of purpose Harris showed in Red Dragon, Hannibal seems grotesquely inflated, full of florid camp, notable chiefly for the willed preposterousness of its ending and interesting only for its bizarre destruction of a lucrative franchise. On reflection, best read as a rogue episode of Frasier minus the humour.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502347855,00.html\">Buy The Big Squeeze at BOL</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502395906,00.html\">Buy Other People's Rules at BOL</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502411657,00.html\">Buy The Runner at BOL</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502371281,00.html\">Buy Hannibal at BOL</a></p>",

Observation rather than narrative drives her story of social hypocrisy, with Hamilton alert to smugness - and its corollary, eating disorders - and \"the white noise of the upper class, a perpetual drone of loaded detail\". Toffs behaving badly is a safe bet; here a Thatcherite aristo fulfils the brief with his taste for teenage girls - including his daughter - generally lording it and getting away with murder. Although it is unlikely that a Catholic earl would also be grand master of the local Masonic lodge. Hard to say why Christopher Reich was drawn to set his story in Germany, 1945 - perhaps it was his name. The Runner (Headline, \u00a317.99) promises more than it delivers; the US occupation of Germany in the weeks after the war was far more surreal than Reich allows. His manhunt - ex-cop after nasty Nazi who murdered his brother, a priest - aspires to efficiency rather than achieving it. It is let down by Reich's penchant for over-revved verbs: examples from successive paragraphs include barrelled, careering, shooting, flooding, dashing, threw, coughed, sputtered, grasped, thrust, slammed. Perhaps it went wrong for Thomas \" Silence of the Lambs \" Harris when a clever Oxbridge professor declared that he was writing in the Gothic tradition, at which point the etiolated literary set thought it had better pay attention. Come Hannibal (Arrow, \u00a36.99), they duly praised. The funniest reading in this paperback edition are the puffs handed out by the review boys, clapping their hands while running to catch up. To them the book's appeal was its snobbishness, always an Achilles heel. Fine wines, bon vivant, a taste for the exquisite, a prep-school nastiness - reversion to Ian Fleming without the \u00e9lan - they fall for it every time. The perverse act of rehabilitation offered by Harris's \"monster turns hero\" line was either breathtaking or silly, depending on whether you bought the story. If you didn't, then compared to the lean sense of purpose Harris showed in Red Dragon, Hannibal seems grotesquely inflated, full of florid camp, notable chiefly for the willed preposterousness of its ending and interesting only for its bizarre destruction of a lucrative franchise. On reflection, best read as a rogue episode of Frasier minus the humour. Buy The Big Squeeze at BOL Buy Other People's Rules at BOL Buy The Runner at BOL Buy Hannibal at BOL",

Both books reveal an abiding impulse to dissect what Desai once called \"the web of [family] relationships, sticky and sweet, clinging and trapping\". But while these stories slyly take a scalpel to family ties that stifle as much as they sustain, they extend her range in intriguing directions, charting not only bitter confinement but also heady escape. </p> <p> Fasting, Feasting (now a Vintage paperback) casts a coolly ironic gaze at parallel symptoms of dysfunction erupting in provincial India and suburban America, from bride-burning to bulimia. Food is central, whether scarce and meanly rationed in a middle-class Indian home, or abundant yet rejected in the New England of eating disorders and obsessive keep-fit.</p> <p>The stories in Diamond Dust range across not two but three continents, tracking people on the move - whether exiled from India or Mexico to US campuses (where Desai has taught for years) or fleeing sweltering summers for the relief of Himalayan hills or the Cornish seaside. While mother figures ply long-departed sons with \"favourite\" childhood foods in vain attempts to rekindle waning bonds, gulfs of incomprehension and resentment open up as the migrants are transformed by their journeys. </p> <p>\"Winterscape\", like Fasting, Feasting, contrasts the strength of familial ties in north America and India, as Rakesh's \"two mothers\" visit him and his pregnant wife Beth in Toronto. Although Beth chafes against this invasion of \"two foreigners\" from her husband's past in Punjab, she gradually gains insight into the love that made Anu gift her own son to her widowed, childless sister Asha, Rakesh's mother and aunt swapping places. In \"Tepoztlan\", a nephew's return from Texas to a Mexican mountain village where \"ageing daughters looked after aged parents\" stirs an old claustrophobia, driving him to flee again a household of bitter complaint, \"shrouded and still\" as an empty parrot's cage. \"Ah, the gringo\", the locals mutter sarcastically. </p> <p>Amid exquisite descriptions of nature and evocation of atmosphere are the violence and rapacity that characteristically break the calm surface of Desai's fiction. In \"Royalty\", a leech-like character exploits the hospitality of friends, while in the title story a civil servant heads for tragedy over his fondness for his \"badmash\" pet dog, Diamond. There is also comedy, as in the story where a family bound for Simla gets stuck in a traffic jam, which may be no more than a ruse to deliver captive business to the myriad roadside vendors who materialise out of the dust.</p> <p>In one of the finest and most moving stories, \"Underground\", the focus shifts from a couple motoring in Cornwall to a widower, Bob, whom they disturb when they seek a room at his guest house. Their knock triggers memories of buying the hotel with his dying wife, and of his previous job in Iraq, where he found \"his voice raised, loudly, like a caricature, a cartoon of a British colonial\" at the enticing vision of a close-knit local family that excluded him. </p> <p>The final and most satisfying story in this collection returns to the subject of Desai's earliest fiction: the lone or isolated woman in India and the ambivalence of independence. In \"The Rooftop Dwellers\", Moyna, testing her wings as a \"working woman in the metropolis\", joins a Delhi community of single lodgers in adjacent barsatis or rooftop rooms. Her new landlords raise their eyes from mythological TV epics only to narrow them disapprovingly at their lodger (\"too young, too pretty, too unattached\"), yet her spirits lift as she savours a new freedom in her rooftop \"palace\", shaded by the canopy of a parrot-filled pipal tree. </p> <p>The tone marks a shift from Desai's previous fiction, which has tended to count the high price to women of claiming such freedoms. While Moyna's shunning of the shelter of family does subject her to the scrutiny and exploitation of landlords, gropers on buses, a lewd gallery of rooftop onlookers and an insolent servant boy who blasts out tapes he has stolen from her, the final note is one of triumph. While Fasting, Feasting ultimately affirms the comfort and endurance of family ties - however constraining - here the epiphany is one of escape. It is as though, training her eyes on a later generation of women than her own, Desai is finally able to celebrate a widening of the frontiers.</p>",

From Noah's Flood to the Vietnam War, he argues that sudden and unexpected meteorological calamities and our failure to predict them have changed the results of battles, leading indirectly to the fall of civilisations.

But was Durschmied really there when, on September 11, AD9, two Roman legionnaires whispered their fears to each other?

This is not popular science but science fiction - only without the science. </p> <p>In Floods, Famines and Emperors, Brian Fagan also takes an \"if only\" view of world history. However, by confining himself to a specific phenomenon he has produced a far more convincing account. El Nino is a periodic event during which upwellings of warm water in the Pacific give rise to savage storms, resulting in a huge rise in rainfall over some parts of the world and unexpected droughts in others. </p> <p>Fagan puts the current El Nino in a historical perspective, from the collapse of the Maya civilisation in Mexico to the 22nd century BC, when a great drought threatened to destroy the Egyptians. During years of plenty, the pharaohs had had the foresight to increase crop yields and store food; if only modern governments were so far-sighted. The account of recent El Ninos is one of greed, misallocated resources and the exploitation of land for short-term gain. The message may not be new, but it still bears repeating: we have learned nothing from history. </p> <p>The same lesson can be learned from Fire from the Mountain by Polly Pattullo, which tells of the effects of volcanic eruption on Montserrat. Until recently, if we had any image of Montserrat at all, it was of a sun-drenched island in a calm blue sea. Then, on the morning of June 25 1997, after almost two years of rumblings, the Soufriere Hills volcano finally blew its top. The next day, Montserrat and its people were front-page news. </p> <p>Pattullo traces the events leading up to the final eruption and its consequences. Although more than two thirds of the island's inhabitants left the area following the first stirrings of the volcano in 1995, many stayed put. Nineteen people died in the eruption, a relatively small number compared to other recent disasters. What kept Montserrat in the headlines was the bungling of the British government, and in particular the remarks of the secretary of state for overseas development, Clare Short. It was she who complained that the island's government wanted so much money, \"it will be golden elephants next\". Under any circumstances this would have been a serious gaffe. At a time when the volcano looked as though it was about to erupt again, it was a truly monumental one. </p> <p>Silver linings are few and far between, but this terrible event did bring forth a collection of songs, poetry and prose, including these lines by Howard Fergus: \"But volcano is boss man, only one in its class, man...\" A well-wrought miniature is often worth more than a sprawling canvas, a sonnet more revealing than a 1,000-page potboiler. So if you really want to find out about the way natural events can shape the course of history, read Fire from the Mountain.</p>",

It was she who complained that the island's government wanted so much money, \"it will be golden elephants next\". Under any circumstances this would have been a serious gaffe. At a time when the volcano looked as though it was about to erupt again, it was a truly monumental one. Silver linings are few and far between, but this terrible event did bring forth a collection of songs, poetry and prose, including these lines by Howard Fergus: \"But volcano is boss man, only one in its class, man...\" A well-wrought miniature is often worth more than a sprawling canvas, a sonnet more revealing than a 1,000-page potboiler. So if you really want to find out about the way natural events can shape the course of history, read Fire from the Mountain.",

The party had grown in mighty bounds to become the largest democratic political organisation on earth. The ball attracted all sides, the right wing represented by Edward Bernstein and the revolutionary wing by Rosa Luxemburg. The mood of the evening was triumphalist: the party was about to emerge into the century of great hope. Whatever the means of change, whether through parliament or revolution, it seemed obvious to all the guests that nothing could stop the relentless progress of social democracy and the benefits which it would shower on the whole human race. </p> <p>Less than a decade and a half later, the great hope disintegrated into unimaginable despair. The first world war, supported by the German social democrats and the British Labour Party, consigned millions of the young men of Europe to the charnel house. For a brief moment after the war, some of the optimism of that eve-of-century ball returned, only to be plunged into gloom in the 1930s, \"the dark valley\". The great hope vanished and in its place came slump, fascism, another war and the Holocaust. The rest of the century was haunted by the howling ghosts of the dark valley: every rise in unemployment, every attack on racial minorities, every slippage on the stock exchange, every censored broadcast sent out tremors of apprehension that what happened in the 30s might be coming again. </p> <p>Globalisation is usually presented as a modern phenomenon. The outstanding contribution of Piers Brendon's history is his presentation of the 30s as a decade in which each apparently independent part of the world depended on the others. The slump and the depression set off by the Wall Street crash in 1929 quickly enveloped Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.</p> <p>Brendon fits the story of what happened in each of these nations into an international pattern. Seasoned democracies such as the US, Britain and France, whose governments had won the war, somehow managed to survive the economic blizzard, but the effect on Germany, Japan and Italy was to replace democracy with a crazed fascist militarism which speedily degenerated into racist terror and imperialist aggression.</p> <p>In Spain, the elected government was toppled after a long and ferocious civil war set off by a fascist rebellion. As they drowned in what seemed an unstoppable right-wing tide, millions of victims and their sympathisers cast hopeful eyes towards what they were led to believe was a new socialist dawn in Russia. In fact the new dawn was by that stage a grotesque hoax, kept alive by merciless and mendacious propaganda.</p> <p>A consistent theme in this book is that official mendacity was common to all countries, whether or not their governments depended on votes. Everywhere those in power laid hold of the means of informing people - and informed them in terms opposite to the truth. In this process there was very little to choose between, for instance, the war propaganda of the Japanese government and British ministers' assumption that the purpose of the BBC and almost all the free press was to state and argue the ministers' case. </p> <p>Brendon tells his story kaleidoscopically, alternating his chapters country by country. Somehow he manages to get through his vast panorama without a moment's dullness; his characters come to life in a flurry of detail about their appearances and habits. He never takes refuge in blandness, the usual retreat of boring historians. </p> <p>And there is no comfort here for the mass of increasingly fashionable historians who surmise that there may, after all, have been something to be said for Hitler or Franco or Mussolini or Hoover or Chamberlain or Ramsay MacDonald. In Brendon's view, MacDonald's socialism was \"like Harris tweed in Bavaria\"; his \"cut the dole\" policy in 1931 was based on \"penalising the indigent for the failures of the opulent\". Lord Plymouth, who headed the British government's non-intervention committee for Spain, was a \"patrician nincompoop\", Ward Price of the Daily Mail \"an odious toady\". The young king Edward VIII \"sympathised with the poor but associated with the rich\"; the French foreign minister Georges Bonnet had \"the courage of his own lack of conviction\" and Randolph Churchill was \"not fit to be allowed out in private\". Although Brendon is the keeper of the Churchill archives at Cambridge, he is by no means sycophantic towards Randolph's celebrated father, Winston, who, he reminds us, was tremendously impressed by Italian fascism and by extremist militarism in Japan. </p> <p>But the strength of this book does not depend on such insights into its characters, nor on the flashes of literary criticism, for instance of George Orwell, Ernest Hemingway and Louis MacNeice. Rather, great chunks of this history rest on unfashionable opinions. The \"most fundamental cause\" of the great crash in the US, for instance, was \"financial inequalities\". Republican Spain was smothered \"by the poisonous tendrils of Stalinism\". And the key to understanding Stalin was not his association with the Russian revolution but his obsession with eradicating every vestige of that revolution in order, as Brendon puts it, \"to destroy every shred of left-wing opposition\". All these ideas shed new light into the gloomiest recesses of the dark valley. </p> <p>There are times when the author's obsession with detail distracts him from the central issues. The biggest question of all about the 30s is surely \"could Hitler have been stopped?\" Brendon explains how much his chancellorship owed to chance and intrigue. In the November 1932 elections only weeks previously, the Nazis lost 2m votes, and even after Hitler became chancellor, the electorate refused him the endorsement he confidently expected. He got the constitutional majority he needed by the subtle device of imprisoning all the elected communist deputies. But what Brendon almost completely ignores is the response of the communists and social democrats to the rise of fascism.</p> <p>Though their combined vote and their influence in the country was substantially greater than those of the Nazis, both sides - especially the communists - rigidly refused to form a united front against the fascists. The communists, who at one stage were getting 6m votes, renamed the social democrats \"social fascists\". So great was the sectarian divide in those crucial months before the deluge that the communists preferred even to link up and stage strikes with the fascists rather than campaign in the country and in the factories for a unified force against fascism. \"After Hitler, our turn\" was the boast of the communist leader Ernst Thalmann. </p> <p>After Hitler, as it happened, communists and social democrats were at last united - in the concentration camps. Brendon's refusal even to ask the question whether and how Hitler could have been stopped is reflected elsewhere in his book - for instance over the growth of fascism in Italy or the failure of the Popular Front government in France to go to the aid of republican Spain. Brendon might reply that his job is to tell history as it was, not as it might have been. But at least one of the virtues of such an authoritative and moving account is to arm us against any repetition of similar horrors in the future.</p>",

Radically, she suggests that the representational practices of drawing and painting were models for the performative fiction of courtiership - itself a disguised mode of political agency - and examines these ideas within the absolutist politics of the English court.</p> <p>Sprezzatura, Bermingham argues, prizes masculine grace and virtue and displaces the negative aspects of \"dissimulation\" on to women. She relates this trope of displacement to Elizabeth I's simultaneous concerns with controlling productions of her image and the suppression of aspects of her own body. This idea is extremely interesting, but the notion of sprezzatura is curious in relation to the laboured miniatures of Nicholas Hilliard, with their jewelled detail and stiff and hieratic poses. Graceful sprightliness is a more convincing attribute of Sir Anthony van Dyck, and Bermingham digresses from her discussion of drawing in the Stuart period for a close reading of his painting \"Charles I Hunting\" (circa 1635). </p> <p>Drawing was the private amateur pastime of the aristocratic connoisseurs or \"virtuosi\" attached to the court of Charles I. In the unsettled economic climate leading up to the Civil War, class distinctions were fluid and virtuosity was powerfully coded as a social signifier, requiring wealth, knowledge and sensibility. Bermingham contrasts this with a post-Civil War society in which the new virtuosity depended on intellectual attainments as much as wealth, encountered in many of the founding members of the Royal Society such as Sir Christopher Wren. Drawing, she proposes, served the development of empirical natural science. </p> <p>Very much at home in the 18th century, Bermingham discusses the role of landscape drawing in constructions of national identity and class. Boldly defining the landscapes of \"sense, sensibility and sensation\" rather than topographic, picturesque and naturalistic, she focuses on the moral, political and social values of types of landscape within the ideology of the aesthetic. The introduction of drawing into military schools, for example, happened at a time when there were military and agricultural imperatives for accurate maps. Meanwhile, the proliferation of drawing manuals which emphasised a repertoire of \"touches\" and differentiated strokes for varied foliage and tree shapes constituted an ideology of \"sensation\", of which Constable's Stour Valley landscapes are the supreme records. </p> <p>In the early 19th century, an era of feminised amateurism, aristocratic and middle-class girls were taught by a new class of peripatetic drawing masters, among them some artists of merit. Academician Angelica Kauffman provided images for uses such as the embellishment of furniture, and the products of Josiah Wedgwood constituted a new commercial aestheticisation of the home. The profound effects of all this on professional artists associated with the Royal Academy led to a \"remasculinisation\" of high art; Bermingham cites the angry outbursts of artists such as Benjamin Robert Haydon against crass commercialisation. There was a feminine critique, too: Mary Wollstonecroft and Hannah More warned women against the \"mischief\" of commercial consumption, joining William Hazlitt in his tirades against corruption of taste and female vulgarity. </p> <p>Bermingham constructs a welcome feminist reframing of 19th-century female artistic accomplishments within the domestic space. Not just useless activities for filling idle hours but skills tied to the marriageability of women, they sometimes conflicted with prevailing notions of feminine modesty, as suggested in readings from Jane Austen. Flower painting, a specifically women's art despised by the Royal Academy, created a huge literature of manuals printed with new technologies and allowed women a degree of professionalisation through the study of botany. </p> <p>The book concludes with a survey of female art education in the second half of the 19th century. In tracing the history of the government Schools of Design, Bermingham signals the end of the high period of the female amateur artist. She also retells the story of Fox Talbot's development of photography as a graphic art: Talbot's prophetic belief that photography would become the medium of the amateur very rapidly came true, causing drawing to lose its connection with everyday life and its place in the construction of a social self. Bermingham's well-argued conclusion is that realism thus became relegated to the style of the amateur. \"Modernism's indifference to nature, and amateurism's reverence for it, is not only an origin of avant-garde abstraction but of all those views of glowing sunsets that we associate with amateur art.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Amateur Artists and Drawing Masters 1600-1800 is at the British Museum until Sept 24.</p>",
