A circular structure walled with dry stone stands on Cat Cairn, a rocky outcrop overlooking Kielder Forest, Northumberland, a spot that feels as far from modern urban life as it is possible to get. To enter James Turrell's Skyspace you have to pass through a tunnel in the hillside, like the passages that led into the neolithic barrows once built in places like this. Crossing this threshold, you are invited to worship the sky. </p> <p>The Skyspace is a circular white-walled room with a bench round the circumference and a circular hole in the roof. The hole is like the pupil of an eye fixed unblinkingly on the heavens. You can sit, or better still lie, on the bench and watch the sky move across the aperture. Everything speeds up: you realise how fast things change when you concentrate on the same bit of sky. Clouds unravel. For a while - if you're lucky - the sky turns completely blue. </p> <p>It's impossible to see it as empty space. Instead you experience the illusion that the sky is a dome. This perceptual shift is called \"celestial vaulting\". Lying here, it makes you feel part of nature. Stumbling out of the Skyspace into a landscape of felled trees and mossy stones, you are more aware of the texture of light, the colours in the sky. </p> <p>Turrell was part of a group of artists who made installations with light and space in 1960s California. Since the 1970s he has been turning the Roden Crater, an extinct volcano in the Painted Desert outside Flagstaff, Arizona, into a labyrinthine system of Skyspaces receptive to light from different parts of the galaxy. Turrell is the last great American romantic artist, giving the viewer rhapsodic encounters with nature and the mystery of light. He proves that artists can still look at nature afresh. </p> <p>It's like a new religion - you can imagine a future in which James Turrell is venerated as the prophet of light and every community has its own Skyspace. Turrell has cited Maes Howe in Scotland, constructed 5,000 years ago and aligned to receive the light of the winter solstice, as an influence on the Roden Crater. Seeing his Skyspace in Kielder, you realise that what he really wants to do is take us back to the stone age. </p> <p> Details: 01434 220643. </p>",

So Stefanos Lazaridis has come up with an all-purpose setting onto which extra elements will be grafted to define each staging. But this is more than some neutral, background idea. Lazaridis's set confronts the audience as soon as they enter the auditorium; made of old scaffolding lashed together, it encloses the stalls with a walkway running the whole circumference of the auditorium at circle level, with ladders to higher platforms where the boxes would otherwise be and similar galleries surrounding the acting area. A spiral stairway leads upwards from the stage into the flies. </p> <p>For the opening show, director Keith Warner has used every level to come up with a wonderfully rich, psychologically penetrating and dramatically effective staging of Manon Lescaut that steadily tightens its focus, just as the opera does, on to the pair of doomed lovers. The galleries are thronged with the chorus in the opening act, observing and commenting upon the burgeoning love between Manon and des Grieux, and they follow her downfall in the second with equal relish. In the third the convicted women embarking on the prison ship to America are paraded around the auditorium on the walkway, derided by the chorus all the time. The distinction between audience and action, already blurred by the portrayal of the old rou\u00e9 Edmondo as a chorus figure, becomes hard to sustain, so that the final act played out between Manon and des Grieux in the wreckage of the set is all the more concentrated. </p> <p>Warner makes telling use of symbolism too. As the prelude is played, a masked figure, representing the corrupt world that will bring Manon's destruction, teases a young girl (Manon herself, presumably) with toys - a horse, a gilded mansion. When she is arrested as a prostitute at the end of the second act, Edmondo brutally stamps upon the house. In the final scene, as the lovers expire in the desert, Manon catches sight of her reflection and sees instead that young girl. They are simple gestures, yet wonderfully effective. The show is full of such careful details, which cumulatively bring this sometimes problematic drama to life. </p> <p>The main challenge is mapping the personality of Manon herself - an innocent virgin in the first act, transformed into a grasping opportunist in the second, yet changed again into a tragic heroine by the end. Nina Stemme manages that progression pretty convincingly, singing better and better as the evening went on. Martin Thompson's des Grieux is sturdily sung too. David Kempster's Lescaut is nicely ambivalent, Mark Richardson's Geronte an irredeemable old lecher, and John Graham-Hall's Edmondo a wonderful Voltairian portrait of total corruption. The chorus are brilliantly marshalled, and Paul Daniel conducts the score with increasing passion and certainty as the opera homes in on its tragic target.

Even though he never had to sign the Official Secrets Act, he says, he kept his counsel, \"based on my own principles and conscience.\" As a result, even his closest family were kept in the dark on all matters deemed top secret. \"I didn't tell them anything.

And I'd have to say: 'I can't really tell you.' I'm in the same situation now as most of my work is confidential and because we talk about work so much, there's an element of, well, what kind of conversations can you have?\" </p> <p>During the 10 years he served in the SAS, Neil Coleman could give no indication to his family when, where or for how long he'd be gone. \"It was stressful,\" he says. \"There were times in my life when nobody knew where I was - and when you went home everything could be hunky-dory or your wife could have left you.\" </p> <p>In a career marked by extreme danger - including helping to end the Iranian embassy siege in 1980 - the strain of not talking about work often manifested itself indirectly in his personal relationships, which suffered as a result. \"The nature of the job and the lack of communication obviously caused pressures with your wife, so in my job there was a high divorce rate.\" He even attributes part of the post-traumatic stress from which he still suffers to that specific job requirement. </p> <p>But there are things to be gained from an embargo on work-oriented coversation, argues Guy Fielding, a lecturer at Oxford University who has researched secrets, lies and interpersonal relationships. \"The flipside of this kind of secrecy is that these people could get some separation between the various aspects of their life,\" he says. \"They have to divide work life from family life and social life, which can give psychological benefit.\" </p> <p>Perhaps it is for this reason that Commander David Perfect had no qualms about being restrained from talking shop with family and friends during his 31-year career in the Royal Navy's submarine service. \"There were lots of times we couldn't talk about the job, but I didn't find it particularly hard. In fairness to the system, it was explained to everyone what you could or could not say, and everybody knew the ground rules. I could say, I'm going away at this time, I'm likely to be back at this time and this is the sort of area I'll be in.\" </p> <p>Navy bases provided an essential support network for his family in his absence, Perfect says. \"There were a lot of wives living together and they all had their own ideas about what we were up to. It didn't really matter whether they were right or wrong - it just helped.\" </p> <p>But by no means everyone who takes a vow of secrecy manages to muster so much self-control - and the consequences can be devastating, as history demonstrates, from the intrigues of Imperial Rome to the Profumo affair and beyond. Gordievsky admits it is a temptation to which even the most cunning of double agents is subject. \"I had a British lady friend and it was difficult not to share the circumstances of my job with someone I was that close to. We talked about her work more, but sometimes I did open up to her, which was a bit against the rules.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, Gordievsky says, the secretiveness imposed by a career in espionage may be equalled by the pressures towards confidentiality of the modern business world. \"It was hard, but sometimes I think it wasn't as hard as some of the pressures people have in business today,\" he says. \"They have obligations to the deals they strike - a lot feel they can't turn to anyone when they think things are wrong or corrupt.

      "body": "<p>It is hard to believe now but 12 months ago English cricket was lying in a tattered heap. A desperate World Cup, preceded by an undermining shabby scuffling over money, was followed by a humiliating defeat by a modest New Zealand side. England, unofficially anyway, were deemed to be the worst international team on earth. </p> <p>In that year since then the change round has been astonishing and when, on a gorgeous early autumn day, Nasser Hussain lifted the Wisden Trophy aloft on the Oval balcony it put the cap on the most compelling international season that this country has seen since the Ashes were turned round in 1981. </p> <p>How rosy is the garden really though, and in particular, are England beginning to achieve in spite of still, rather than because of, the system? Much has been made this season of the revamped two-divisional county championship and there is no question that August blues, where cricketers with nothing to play for wish their lives away, have been replaced by some admirable relegation and promotion scraps. Yet there is something imperfect in a championship that will see a third of each division promoted and relegated each year (imagine football's Premiership like that). </p> <p>Whatever the competitive edge, however, the standard of cricket remains disappointingly the same and will do so until a way is found of concentrating talent into fewer sides, so that the transition between domestic and international cricket is as seamless as possible. Regional cricket - six sides with county cricket providing the next tier equivalent to Australian grade cricket - has to be investigated. </p> <p>The standard of pitches both domestic and international remains at an all-time low, too. There is something wrong when matches are consistently finishing inside three days and in the case of Headingley in less than two. </p> <p>Then there is the dearth of spin bowling and the capacity to play it which will hold England back as a top-flight Test nation. They will be facing the three best spinners in the world - Saqlain Mushtaq, Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne - in the course of the next year and the difference between success and failure as a side could hinge on how well they are handled. England need to encourage youngsters to visit the academies of the subcontinent as part of their education. </p> <p>Yet England fortunes were nonetheless turned around with dramatic effect. Three series, Tests and one-day, were all won. Zimbabwe, a team of limited resource but resourceful, were no walkover. But at Lord's in their first Test in England they got stage fright and, although in the second Test they punched their weight and gave England a late scare, they had missed an opportunity. </p> <p>Next came the first two Tests against West Indies. In the opener, on yet another inferior Test strip at Edgbaston, England were trounced in three days and, in the eyes of the public, all the old doubts resurfaced. These were put firmly in their place by a stunning performance at Lord's where imminent defeat was transposed to victory in one of the most scintillating Tests seen. </p> <p>More success came in the triangular series and the wagon was rolling. Since then, when team uncertainties began to be eliminated, the side has not looked back and there is genuine hope of a successful winter in Pakistan and Sri Lanka and of a real tilt at the Ashes next summer. </p> <p>So why the transformation? The appointment of Hussain as captain, and then of the dispassionate Zimbabwean Duncan Fletcher as coach, has proved inspirational. Hussain is authoritative and up front, Fletcher the quiet, firm, understated bedrock to the England cause. Together, in South Africa last winter, they set out to identify the best players, not just technically but temperamentally, and to give them the best conditions in which to flourish. </p> <p>There was a nucleus to the side: Atherton, Alec Stewart, Darren Gough and Andy Caddick. Out of the South African winter had come Michael Vaughan's unflappable batting and, by chance, Craig White's genuine pace and swing. Dominic Cork returned for West Indies and immediately announced himself once more as a match-winner, while Marcus Trescothick justified Fletcher's judgment of his ability. </p> <p>Central contracts, while requiring review, ensured Gough, the player of the summer, and Caddick stayed fit and it was the controlled and continuous aggression of the pace quartet that won the summer. </p> <p>For now Hussain, Fletcher and their team deserve all the plaudits. But we need a sense of perspective. England are middling, no more than that, and the big boys are waiting. We need to be optimistic but realistic. The next twelve months will offer no easy ride. </p> <p>\u0095 The Yorkshire fast bowler Matthew Hoggard was yesterday named as the replacement for the injured Alan Mullally in England's one-day squad to play in Kenya, Pakistan and Sri Lanka this winter.</p>",

Yet there is something imperfect in a championship that will see a third of each division promoted and relegated each year (imagine football's Premiership like that). Whatever the competitive edge, however, the standard of cricket remains disappointingly the same and will do so until a way is found of concentrating talent into fewer sides, so that the transition between domestic and international cricket is as seamless as possible. Regional cricket - six sides with county cricket providing the next tier equivalent to Australian grade cricket - has to be investigated. The standard of pitches both domestic and international remains at an all-time low, too. There is something wrong when matches are consistently finishing inside three days and in the case of Headingley in less than two. Then there is the dearth of spin bowling and the capacity to play it which will hold England back as a top-flight Test nation. They will be facing the three best spinners in the world - Saqlain Mushtaq, Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne - in the course of the next year and the difference between success and failure as a side could hinge on how well they are handled. England need to encourage youngsters to visit the academies of the subcontinent as part of their education. Yet England fortunes were nonetheless turned around with dramatic effect. Three series, Tests and one-day, were all won. Zimbabwe, a team of limited resource but resourceful, were no walkover. But at Lord's in their first Test in England they got stage fright and, although in the second Test they punched their weight and gave England a late scare, they had missed an opportunity. Next came the first two Tests against West Indies. In the opener, on yet another inferior Test strip at Edgbaston, England were trounced in three days and, in the eyes of the public, all the old doubts resurfaced. These were put firmly in their place by a stunning performance at Lord's where imminent defeat was transposed to victory in one of the most scintillating Tests seen. More success came in the triangular series and the wagon was rolling. Since then, when team uncertainties began to be eliminated, the side has not looked back and there is genuine hope of a successful winter in Pakistan and Sri Lanka and of a real tilt at the Ashes next summer. So why the transformation? The appointment of Hussain as captain, and then of the dispassionate Zimbabwean Duncan Fletcher as coach, has proved inspirational. Hussain is authoritative and up front, Fletcher the quiet, firm, understated bedrock to the England cause. Together, in South Africa last winter, they set out to identify the best players, not just technically but temperamentally, and to give them the best conditions in which to flourish. There was a nucleus to the side: Atherton, Alec Stewart, Darren Gough and Andy Caddick. Out of the South African winter had come Michael Vaughan's unflappable batting and, by chance, Craig White's genuine pace and swing. Dominic Cork returned for West Indies and immediately announced himself once more as a match-winner, while Marcus Trescothick justified Fletcher's judgment of his ability. Central contracts, while requiring review, ensured Gough, the player of the summer, and Caddick stayed fit and it was the controlled and continuous aggression of the pace quartet that won the summer. For now Hussain, Fletcher and their team deserve all the plaudits. But we need a sense of perspective. England are middling, no more than that, and the big boys are waiting. We need to be optimistic but realistic. The next twelve months will offer no easy ride. \u0095 The Yorkshire fast bowler Matthew Hoggard was yesterday named as the replacement for the injured Alan Mullally in England's one-day squad to play in Kenya, Pakistan and Sri Lanka this winter.",

Good work by Giggs works the ball out into safety.<br> <strong>8</strong> Almost a goal for United when Giggs plays in Yorke on the edge of the area, but the striker drags his shot wide of the right stick.<br> <strong>10</strong> Kiev lob the ball over the United back line but are caught offside.<br> <strong>12</strong> Giggs finds Silvestre deep in the left, but his cross is into space and easy for Kiev keeper Shovkovsky.<br> <strong>13</strong> A very lively start to the game with Kiev dong a good job of closing United down and forcing them to give away possession. The surface looks heavy and both teams appear to have decided that a quick passing game is the key to a result.<br> <strong>15</strong> Some space for United as Giggs cuts in from the left, but Kiev clear again as he tries to find Yorke.<br> <strong>19</strong> Cole on the left area cuts the ball back for Beckham to rifle in a shot - blocked.<br> <strong>20</strong> Corner to United on the right, but it comes to nothing. Corner to United on the left and Shovkovsky loses sight of the ball before it is cleared.<br> <strong>24</strong> The quick passing game seems to be failing on the dodgy surface and Kiev both sides are finding it hard to hang on to possession.<br> <strong>25</strong> Free-kick to United just over the half-way line. The ball is worked quickly down the right and back for Cole to shoot from the edge of the area. The ball loops up from a deflection and Keane clashes with the keeper as tries to pick up the rebound.<br> <strong>27</strong> Shatskikh tries a shot from distance and is unlucky to see it go narrowly wide.<br> <strong>29</strong> Bialkevich comes close for Kiev when he gets away on the left, cuts inside and works the ball on to his right foot before shooting from just outside the area - Van Der Gouw does well to turn it wide of the far post. <br> <strong>33</strong> United enjoying the best of the possession and still look the more likely to score despite a couple of good chances from Kiev.<br> <strong>35</strong> United in control as Kiev are caught offside yet again.<br> <strong>37</strong> And caught again, although it lookd as though Irwin was playing him on. Lucky, as Irwin then went on to bring down the Kiev player inside the area. <br> <strong>40</strong> Giggs races away through midfield on the counter and finds Cole on the right.

Manchester United: 17-Raimond Van Der Gouw, 2-Gary Neville, 3-Denis Irwin, 5-Ronny Johnsen, 27-Mickael Silvestre, 7-David Beckham, 8-Nicky Butt, 9-Andy Cole, 11-Ryan Giggs, 16-Roy Keane, 19-Dwight Yorke. Referee: Kim Milton Nielsen (Denmark) 1 Kiev kick-off in a chilly stadium as United seek to build on their excellent start to this season's campaign. 2 Silvestre lobs the ball up the left flank as United seek to get an early advantage. Kiev reply with a run by Khatskevitch through midfield; he finds Bialkevich outside the area but Van Der Gouw gets there first. 4 Khaladze is brought down by Irwin 30 yards out on the right for a Kiev free-kick but it comes to nothing. 5 Referee Nielsen has a word with Demetradze after a late challenge on Silvestre. 7 United free-kick; Beckham takes from deep in midfield straight into the Kiev area, Kiev counter and United are caught short at the back when Shatskikh gets into the area. Good work by Giggs works the ball out into safety. 8 Almost a goal for United when Giggs plays in Yorke on the edge of the area, but the striker drags his shot wide of the right stick. 10 Kiev lob the ball over the United back line but are caught offside. 12 Giggs finds Silvestre deep in the left, but his cross is into space and easy for Kiev keeper Shovkovsky. 13 A very lively start to the game with Kiev dong a good job of closing United down and forcing them to give away possession. The surface looks heavy and both teams appear to have decided that a quick passing game is the key to a result. 15 Some space for United as Giggs cuts in from the left, but Kiev clear again as he tries to find Yorke. 19 Cole on the left area cuts the ball back for Beckham to rifle in a shot - blocked. 20 Corner to United on the right, but it comes to nothing. Corner to United on the left and Shovkovsky loses sight of the ball before it is cleared. 24 The quick passing game seems to be failing on the dodgy surface and Kiev both sides are finding it hard to hang on to possession. 25 Free-kick to United just over the half-way line. The ball is worked quickly down the right and back for Cole to shoot from the edge of the area. The ball loops up from a deflection and Keane clashes with the keeper as tries to pick up the rebound. 27 Shatskikh tries a shot from distance and is unlucky to see it go narrowly wide. 29 Bialkevich comes close for Kiev when he gets away on the left, cuts inside and works the ball on to his right foot before shooting from just outside the area - Van Der Gouw does well to turn it wide of the far post. 33 United enjoying the best of the possession and still look the more likely to score despite a couple of good chances from Kiev. 35 United in control as Kiev are caught offside yet again. 37 And caught again, although it lookd as though Irwin was playing him on. Lucky, as Irwin then went on to bring down the Kiev player inside the area. 40 Giggs races away through midfield on the counter and finds Cole on the right. He crosses for Beckham on the left but his chip into the area findds no-one. 41 United corner on the right, Beckham takes and Kiev clear. 42 Beckham finds G Neville on the right but the defender over-hits his cross and the move breaks down. Still very much a game of attack and counter-attack. 45 One extra minute to play as the first half draws to a close. Neither team choses to make much use of it. Half-time. Difficult conditions, but will be pleased with their performance so far. 46 Andy Cole shoots from 25 yards when he should not have been allowed the space - not enough purchase and it is saved easily. 48 Dmitrulin plays in Shatskikh just inside the area and his great first touch sees the ball fly off the crossbar - a lucky escape for United. 49 Strong start to the second half for Kiev as Shatskikh agains is the danger when he gets on the end of a deep cross into the six-yard box, but his header is way off the mark. 51 Shatskikh again as he gets away on the right, but his hopeful cross towards towards lone man Demetradze is hopelessly off target. 53 United yet to attack in this half,but now Beckham gets involved.

      "body": "<p><strong>Fuel blockade hits bookshops</strong></p> <p>If you go down to your local bookshop this week you may be in for a surprise. For bookshops are running out of books. The book trade's supply chain, hardly the swiftest animal on the planet, has been hit by the petrol blockades with a number of book distributors having to suspend their services in the wake of dwindling fuel supplies. Even with the blockades now over it has been reported that it could take up to three weeks for the situation to return to normal, meaning that long-forgotten backlist titles could soon be making an unexpected appearance at the front of bookshops. Students in particular could be affected by shortages, with local campus bookstores lacking the textbooks required to start the new term. </p> <p>For the book trade, which once paid a firm of consultants \u00a3100,000 to inform it that it was wasting \u00a3150m each year shifting books from one location to another, a product blockage during one of its peak selling seasons is the last thing it needs. Voices at trade body the Booksellers Association have been urging publishers to \"consider other methods of delivery\". Quite what they have in mind is anyone's guess. </p> <p><strong>The ups and downs of online publishing</strong></p> <p>This tangible tribulation could be yet another fillip for the virtual world, which has already been boosted by the news that Fay Weldon is publishing her latest book in digital format only, and that Agatha Christie's oeuvre is going online. </p> <p>Ms Weldon's book, entitled Woodworm or Love Among the Scientists, is being published in serial form weekly on the government website <a href=\"http://www.YouGov.com\">www.YouGov.com</a>. According to the site, Weldon's book is the first work to be serialised on the net as it is written: \"Others have published books on the internet, but this is being created exclusively for this site and published immediately each chapter is finished.\" Readers are also encouraged to send their comments to Weldon. The novel itself, which revolves around the scientific aspirations and jealousies of a female cosmologist, her husband who breeds \"sheep from the stem cells of unborn lambs\" and his friend who is \"involved with the genetic modification of tomatoes,\" kicked off this week.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Chorion, which owns the rights to Agatha Christie's vast body of work, has granted Penguin US the licence to publish 10 of her books in electronic format. Chorion, which also owns the rights to Enid Blyton's writing, believes this could be a significant future revenue stream. But it ain't necessarily so, not at least if the latest update on Stephen King's e-book experiment is to be believed. For King, the pioneering e-book advocate and sometime writer of horror books, appears to have run into trouble with his own e-book experiment. The writer, who has been selling his latest novel The Plant for $1 an episode on his website <a href=\"http://www.stephenking.com\">www.stephenking.com</a>, has reported a \"widening disparity between downloads and payments\" and has suggested that there has \"undoubtedly\" been some \"thievery and bootlegging going on\". He also suggests that readers have been downloading more than one version of the text to accommodate their different computer systems or e-books but paying for only one. According to King, this is like book buyers going to a bookstore to ask for free copies of a paperback or audio version of a book because they bought the hardcover. \"As simply as I can put it, you must pay for what you take every time you take it or this won't work,\" King admonishes. King has already stated that if fewer than 75% of downloads were paid for he would desist with the series. Whatever the merits of King's e-book experiment this is now a real possibility, and King risks disappointing his unusually devoted readers - a situation few authors could afford. </p> <p><strong>Terry Pratchett scorns the internet revolution</strong></p> <p>Another blow has been dealt to the e-book revolution by fantasy writer Terry Pratchett who, according to the trade website <a href=\"http://www.theBookseller.com\">www.theBookseller.com</a>, will not be going digital any time soon. </p> <p>Likening the internet to a \"whining Californian mall rat, forever demanding that the real world be redefined to suit its whims\", Mr Pratchett said that \"as things stand\" he would not be doing a Stephen King. Pratchett's latest novel, The Truth, is being published in November. It is to be hoped that book distributors have managed to refuel before then or the author of the Discworld series of books could find himself in for a road to Damascus-style digital reawakening. </p> <p><strong>WH Smith seeks synergy with Booker </strong></p> <p>One thing not worrying Pratchett is the Booker shortlist, due to be announced on October 5. Rumours over the identity of those authors who are likely to make it onto the shortlist have been in shorter supply than usual, but perhaps the field has become much wider than in previous years. Suggestions that the Booker could be dumbing down appear to have been confirmed with the news that WH Smith, purveyor of newspapers, sweets and airport fiction, is \"getting behind\" the prize like never before. The newsagent is to run its first ever in-store promotion for the award this year, with newly designed point-of-sale material. </p> <p>Perhaps WH Smith is hoping for a double whammy from the prize and believes that one of the books chosen for the shortlist could be from its own publisher, Hodder Headline. Indeed, this could be just the kind of synergistic link between the publisher and its parent that WHS chief executive Richard Handover might have hoped for when he paid \u00a3185m for it more than a year ago. Such synergies have been scarce so far within the group, leading some commentators to wonder about the logic behind the original purchase. Those dissenters may well have been joined this week by WH Smiths' new finance director John Warren. Earlier in the week Mr Warren attended a publishing party held by Hodder Headline, only to find that rival bookseller Waterstone's had been contracted to handle the event's book sales. Mr Warren might also like to take a look at Hodder Headline's new consumer website, <a href=\"http://www.madaboutbooks.com\"> www.madaboutbooks.com</a>, which prompts would-be book buyers to purchase their titles from two online bookshops, neither of which is <a href=\"http://www.whsmith.co.uk\">www.whsmith.co.uk</a>.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The huge growth in postgraduate degrees over the past decade has been accompanied by a shift towards vocational training, with courses and skills now much more focused on the needs of business. But there are increasing concerns that universities are being turned into training grounds for industry. </p> <p>Postgraduate education bears little resemblance to what it was 20 years ago. In that time there has been a 400% rise in student numbers and a radical change in the type of people engaged in postgraduate study, with much more part-time study and mature and overseas students. Major changes are taking place which will alter the postgraduate experience and reshape higher education. </p> <p>Postgraduate numbers have risen as people seek to gain further specific training and differentiate themselves in the job market. This means that postgraduate education now has a much more vocational slant to it. The changes are even impacting on research courses, with research and funding councils increasingly stressing the training elements of postgraduate life. </p> <p>Recent reviews by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) both of which have expanded or made explicit reference to training in postgraduate education. It is no longer seen as sufficient for someone to work on a specific piece of research; they must finish with a set of transferrable skills which can be applied not only in an academic context but in any work situation. </p> <p>The student progress files initiative takes this a stage further by introducing greater comparability and consistency into a student's record of achievement. These take the form of individual transcripts which are set to become much more comprehensive.

      "bodyText": "The huge growth in postgraduate degrees over the past decade has been accompanied by a shift towards vocational training, with courses and skills now much more focused on the needs of business. But there are increasing concerns that universities are being turned into training grounds for industry. Postgraduate education bears little resemblance to what it was 20 years ago. In that time there has been a 400% rise in student numbers and a radical change in the type of people engaged in postgraduate study, with much more part-time study and mature and overseas students. Major changes are taking place which will alter the postgraduate experience and reshape higher education. Postgraduate numbers have risen as people seek to gain further specific training and differentiate themselves in the job market. This means that postgraduate education now has a much more vocational slant to it. The changes are even impacting on research courses, with research and funding councils increasingly stressing the training elements of postgraduate life. Recent reviews by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) both of which have expanded or made explicit reference to training in postgraduate education. It is no longer seen as sufficient for someone to work on a specific piece of research; they must finish with a set of transferrable skills which can be applied not only in an academic context but in any work situation. The student progress files initiative takes this a stage further by introducing greater comparability and consistency into a student's record of achievement. These take the form of individual transcripts which are set to become much more comprehensive. This will enable students and employers to access a more detailed record of achievement which more fully reflects their educational experience. But a more significant part of this initiative for students will be the implementation of personal development plans. These will enable students at all levels to maintain a record of their achievements, goals and experience throughout their courses, and be a major contribution to empowering students in their education. Details of the Progress Files initiative are at www.qaa.ac.uk/ Yet there are worrying aspects to the vocational trends within higher education. Universities are under pressure to make their research, teaching and services more relevant to the broader society and economy. Although this is to be welcomed in principle, many fear that it would be counterproductive to turn universities into mere training grounds for business, industry and the economy. Universities serve a much broader range of functions than this, acting as reserves of knowledge and drivers of initiative, imagination and analysis for society as a whole. Faced with an ever more competitive environment, and persistent funding reductions, the sector is having to fight for its place in society as more than an education factory producing products for consumption by the economy. Proposals from the Conservative party in the past week to free universities by endowing them with funds and removing direct state funding seem to reinforce the idea of universities as no more than servants to the economy. The Conservative proposals say Britain's best universities used to be the best in the world. This is a disingenuous swipe at higher education in Britain as many of us still believe that British universities are the best in the world. Ideas such as these threaten to enhance elitism and reduce opportunity for the population which universities serve as public institutions. For those wishing to pursue an academic career the prospects are often bleak. Salary levels are depressed and for new lecturing staff the pressures to publish and take on extensive teaching responsibilities very quickly are immense.

      "body": "<p>The big news at the opening of the Liberal Democrat conference yesterday was asteroids.</p> <p>The MP for Montgomery, Lembit Opik, has been warning for ages about bodies from outer space hurtling into us, and now the Sainsbury task force scarily says he may be right. \"Opik vindicated\" was the headline on his press release (as opposed to \"Opec vindicated\" which was last week's story.) So when Mr Opik went in to watch Charles Kennedy speak on the petrol crisis, why wasn't he even wearing a crash helmet?</p> <p>Mr Kennedy's speech was tough, uncompromising, but balanced. On the one hand, he said, we had to make the environmental case for using less petrol. On the other hand, the price of petrol had to come down. His audience clearly agreed with both these assertions.</p> <p>\"We have to listen,\" he went on, \"as well as to lead. This week, let us listen as well as lead,\" which I took to mean: we must tell the people what to do, but we must do as they say. We must lead but we must also follow. We must demand coffee but must not be afraid to drink tea. We must sink our teeth into the red meat of power while simultaneously enjoying the vegetarian option ...</p> <p>Mr Matthew Taylor, grandly described as the \"shadow chancellor\", said the petrol protest was helped by mobile phones and the internet. Nowadays people could by-pass governments and make their own decisions. \"In the politics of the 21st century, politicians will need to be honest, because now the people have the power to keep them honest,\" he said.</p> <p>Fat chance, I thought, as I went off to the BT/Hansard Society stand which shows an MP's office in this excitingly honest future. They will wear special glasses which will project computer screens onto their eyeballs. They will conduct video surgeries. With tiny cameras they will also - and this is the really cool part - be able to interview themselves and put the results straight onto their website, so cutting out the middlemen, TV interviewers.</p> <p>They got me to record my views on the petrol crisis. When it was played back my voice sounded normal, but the image on the screen was delayed and cut up into jerky movements of half a second each, giving the impression that some incapable drunk had seized control of the site, which was fair enough, except not at 10.45 in the morning.</p> <p>But that's a minor hitch. MPs will have to resist the temptation to interview themselves blandly. \"I'm glad you asked me that question, and I'd like to reply in five ways...\" won't do.

      "bodyText": "The big news at the opening of the Liberal Democrat conference yesterday was asteroids. The MP for Montgomery, Lembit Opik, has been warning for ages about bodies from outer space hurtling into us, and now the Sainsbury task force scarily says he may be right. \"Opik vindicated\" was the headline on his press release (as opposed to \"Opec vindicated\" which was last week's story.) So when Mr Opik went in to watch Charles Kennedy speak on the petrol crisis, why wasn't he even wearing a crash helmet? Mr Kennedy's speech was tough, uncompromising, but balanced. On the one hand, he said, we had to make the environmental case for using less petrol. On the other hand, the price of petrol had to come down. His audience clearly agreed with both these assertions. \"We have to listen,\" he went on, \"as well as to lead. This week, let us listen as well as lead,\" which I took to mean: we must tell the people what to do, but we must do as they say. We must lead but we must also follow. We must demand coffee but must not be afraid to drink tea. We must sink our teeth into the red meat of power while simultaneously enjoying the vegetarian option ... Mr Matthew Taylor, grandly described as the \"shadow chancellor\", said the petrol protest was helped by mobile phones and the internet. Nowadays people could by-pass governments and make their own decisions. \"In the politics of the 21st century, politicians will need to be honest, because now the people have the power to keep them honest,\" he said. Fat chance, I thought, as I went off to the BT/Hansard Society stand which shows an MP's office in this excitingly honest future. They will wear special glasses which will project computer screens onto their eyeballs. They will conduct video surgeries. With tiny cameras they will also - and this is the really cool part - be able to interview themselves and put the results straight onto their website, so cutting out the middlemen, TV interviewers. They got me to record my views on the petrol crisis. When it was played back my voice sounded normal, but the image on the screen was delayed and cut up into jerky movements of half a second each, giving the impression that some incapable drunk had seized control of the site, which was fair enough, except not at 10.45 in the morning. But that's a minor hitch. MPs will have to resist the temptation to interview themselves blandly. \"I'm glad you asked me that question, and I'd like to reply in five ways...\" won't do. Voters will demand Paxman and Today-style confrontation. \"If you'll just allow me to answer the question\" people will shout at themselves. \"I told you, no questions about my private life!\" they will yell at themselves, before pulling off their mikes and staging an angry walk out from their own front room. After lunch we had the debate on civil partnerships, which include what is generally known as gay marriage. Predictably everyone was in favour, except those who felt that the motion didn't go far enough.

The degree of private ownership has become one of the main criteria by which donors and IFIs judge the extent of transition. Although the World Bank and others have recognised some of the failings of privatisation processes in transition countries, and their alarming social impact, privatisation continues to be pushed as a key policy. The Social impact of privatisation Although there have undoubtedly been some \"winners\" in privatisation processes, among both elites and small producers and traders in some countries, privatisation has contributed to the rapid growth of poverty in transition countries in the following ways: The majority in some countries have been dispossessed of assets they worked hard to build up. These assets are now concentrated in the hands of a small minority. In Kyrgyzstan, for example, \"property distribution worked in favour of a tiny 3 to 7 per cent of the population\" ; inequality has grown faster in Kyrgyzstan than most other countries in the world.

      "body": "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer is expected to sell its Brooks Brothers chain in America and rein in its European businesses under a new plan by Luc Vandevelde to reverse its continued decline. </p> <p>Mr Vandevelde, recruited as chairman with a \u00a32m golden hello in February, also tightened his grip on the retailer yesterday by wielding the axe in the boardroom. He is to flout standard City practice by combining his role as chairman with that of the chief executive after Peter Salsbury's resignation yesterday.</p> <p>Mr Salsbury was one of the last of the \"old\" M&amp;S executives on the board. He had worked at M&amp;S for 29 years and replaced Sir Richard Greenbury - who was also chairman and chief executive.</p> <p>Clara Freeman, UK stores and personnel director, and Guy McCracken, international retail director, have also resigned.</p> <p>The shake-out will cost more than \u00a31m in severance payments to the three executives, who resigned after the retailer admitted sales had fallen 1.2% in the 24 weeks to September 16 compared with the equivalent period last year. The falling sales figures, particularly in clothes rather than household goods and food, come as the retailer tries to kickstart its image with a new advertising campaign.</p> <p>The shake-up was prompted by plunging sales over the last six months despite the company's spending \u00a315m on a new image. The Belgian chairman and chief executive is expected to focus the 115-year-old household name, once famed for its knickers and good quality affordable clothes, on its domestic market. As well as Brooks Brothers it is expected to sell its European operations.</p> <p>Mr Vandevelde is also planning to change the format of M&amp;S's 297 British stores in a strategy which will be revealed next month when the group reports profits figures for the first half - forecasts for which were downgraded yesterday. Mr Vandevelde, who admitted the \"clock was ticking\" on his challenge to turn around the troubled chain, yesterday gave himself the next 18 months of his two year contract to complete his task.</p> <p>\"We need to step up the pace of change. We have to take a very close look at areas we feel may distract our organisational vision,\" he said. He refused to answer specific questions about the prospects for Brooks Brothers or Europe.</p> <p>While M&amp;S has started to change the look of three of its stores, improving the lighting and arranging the rows of clothes in a way associated with a department store, the retailer may introduce other styles of stores focused on certain ranges of items, such as women's wear or household items. Sales in the revamped stores in Leicester, London and Sutton in Surrey, provided one ray of light, showing a combined 16% rise in sales. The group is to announce another 22 of these stores, at cost of \u00a313m, before Christmas. But the extent of the task ahead of the retailer was reflected its shares yesterday, which rose only 2p to 212.5p.</p> <p>The long-rumoured management shake-up, which includes the recruitment of Roger Holmes from Kingfisher on a \u00a3425,000 salary as head of UK retail, was greeted with scepticism. Many industry experts believe the task of shaking off the practices of Sir Richard, the autocratic former chairman, will take years.</p> <p>One industry expert said the only reason the retailer, which faced an attempted bid by entrepreneur Philip Green nine months ago, was not being cited as a takeover target was because it was difficult to name a potential bidder.</p> <p>Mr Vandevelde expects to combine his two roles for the next 18 months though he admitted that he would groom a successor during that time. That is widely expected to be Mr Holmes, whose arrival date at M&amp;S is yet to be agreed. The fact he was not immediately named as chief executive-apparent prompted one source to say: \"Vandevelde has brought in a number two rather than a number one. It was a problem job no one wanted\".</p> <p>Mr Vandevelde dismissed criticism that the group now lacked enough expertise in the retail sector, where M&amp;S derives half its revenue. \"The best clothing talent was on the board five years ago. It didn't prevent it going wrong. We need management talent,\" he said.</p> <p>The search is also under way for a new director of IT and the food business. A replacement is needed for Robert Colvill, the finance director, who retires next year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is expected to sell its Brooks Brothers chain in America and rein in its European businesses under a new plan by Luc Vandevelde to reverse its continued decline. Mr Vandevelde, recruited as chairman with a \u00a32m golden hello in February, also tightened his grip on the retailer yesterday by wielding the axe in the boardroom. He is to flout standard City practice by combining his role as chairman with that of the chief executive after Peter Salsbury's resignation yesterday. Mr Salsbury was one of the last of the \"old\" M&amp;S executives on the board. He had worked at M&amp;S for 29 years and replaced Sir Richard Greenbury - who was also chairman and chief executive. Clara Freeman, UK stores and personnel director, and Guy McCracken, international retail director, have also resigned. The shake-out will cost more than \u00a31m in severance payments to the three executives, who resigned after the retailer admitted sales had fallen 1.2% in the 24 weeks to September 16 compared with the equivalent period last year. The falling sales figures, particularly in clothes rather than household goods and food, come as the retailer tries to kickstart its image with a new advertising campaign. The shake-up was prompted by plunging sales over the last six months despite the company's spending \u00a315m on a new image. The Belgian chairman and chief executive is expected to focus the 115-year-old household name, once famed for its knickers and good quality affordable clothes, on its domestic market. As well as Brooks Brothers it is expected to sell its European operations. Mr Vandevelde is also planning to change the format of M&amp;S's 297 British stores in a strategy which will be revealed next month when the group reports profits figures for the first half - forecasts for which were downgraded yesterday. Mr Vandevelde, who admitted the \"clock was ticking\" on his challenge to turn around the troubled chain, yesterday gave himself the next 18 months of his two year contract to complete his task. \"We need to step up the pace of change. We have to take a very close look at areas we feel may distract our organisational vision,\" he said. He refused to answer specific questions about the prospects for Brooks Brothers or Europe. While M&amp;S has started to change the look of three of its stores, improving the lighting and arranging the rows of clothes in a way associated with a department store, the retailer may introduce other styles of stores focused on certain ranges of items, such as women's wear or household items. Sales in the revamped stores in Leicester, London and Sutton in Surrey, provided one ray of light, showing a combined 16% rise in sales. The group is to announce another 22 of these stores, at cost of \u00a313m, before Christmas. But the extent of the task ahead of the retailer was reflected its shares yesterday, which rose only 2p to 212.5p. The long-rumoured management shake-up, which includes the recruitment of Roger Holmes from Kingfisher on a \u00a3425,000 salary as head of UK retail, was greeted with scepticism. Many industry experts believe the task of shaking off the practices of Sir Richard, the autocratic former chairman, will take years. One industry expert said the only reason the retailer, which faced an attempted bid by entrepreneur Philip Green nine months ago, was not being cited as a takeover target was because it was difficult to name a potential bidder. Mr Vandevelde expects to combine his two roles for the next 18 months though he admitted that he would groom a successor during that time. That is widely expected to be Mr Holmes, whose arrival date at M&amp;S is yet to be agreed. The fact he was not immediately named as chief executive-apparent prompted one source to say: \"Vandevelde has brought in a number two rather than a number one. It was a problem job no one wanted\". Mr Vandevelde dismissed criticism that the group now lacked enough expertise in the retail sector, where M&amp;S derives half its revenue. \"The best clothing talent was on the board five years ago. It didn't prevent it going wrong. We need management talent,\" he said. The search is also under way for a new director of IT and the food business. A replacement is needed for Robert Colvill, the finance director, who retires next year.",

      "bodyText": "A nun was today found guilty of four charges of cruelty against youngsters in her care at children's homes after a court heard that she had force fed and hit them with hairbrushes. Marie Docherty, 58, also known as Sister Alphonso, sat motionless in the dock as the jury returned the four majority guilty verdicts. Three other charges laid against her were found not proven by the nine women and six men, who deliberated for nine-and-a-half hours. Wearing a blue habit, Docherty sat with her head bowed as the courtroom heard the verdict, which came after a 26-day trial at Aberdeen Sheriff Court. Yesterday, the jury was directed by the sheriff to find her not guilty of 14 similar charges due to insufficient evidence and earlier in the trial, two other charges were dropped. Today, she was found guilty of cruel and unnatural treatment of Patricia O'Brien, who was struck against a radiator and punched and slapped repeatedly. She was also found guilty of the same charge relating to Helen Cusiter, who was force-fed and hit with a hairbrush. A charge of cruel and unnatural treatment of Jeanette Adams, who was also hit with a hairbrush and force fed, was also upheld by the jury. Docherty was further found guilty of the same charge against Grace Montgomery, who was force fed sweets and had soiled underwear thrown at her. All the charges related to the nun's time caring for children in Nazareth House children's homes in Aberdeen and Midlothian. One nun in the court's public gallery wept quietly and clutched rosary beads as the verdict was delivered. Sheriff Harris deferred sentence on Docherty until September 28 and called for a report on the nun's medical condition to be prepared before sentence. Docherty had collapsed earlier in the hearing and was found to be suffering from a heart condition after being examined at a private hospital, but she had insisted that the trial should continue. Cameron Fyfe, representing the four people in compensation claims against the Poor Sisters of Nazareth, said that they felt vindicated by the verdicts. He added: \"They are pleased because they have been vindicated to some extent, all along the order of the Catholic Church refused to believe them and had refused to accept that any abuse had taken place. \"Now that a jury has confirmed that some abuse did take place they take some pleasure in that.\" He said, however, there was still \"a long way to go\" in the victims' battles for compensation through the civil courts, but the verdicts had given them a boost.",

Delegates have gossiped about the party's good showing in today's Guardian poll and compared plans for campaigning for the next general election. The mood was cheerful, but also mixed scorn for the government's behaviour over the last week with anger at the tactics used by the petrol protestors. The party seems uncertain as to whether it is now time to make concessions to what seems to be overwhelming public demand for cheaper fuel. On the fringe, the day's most interesting events will come this evening, when former leader Paddy Ashdown breaks his almost complete silence since retiring as leader with a speech on globalisation, while Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore visits, presumably to explain why he cannot stand the party's policies. In the conference hall itself, debates have been going as party planners would wish. The key debate on law and order was led by Simon Hughes, the party's home affairs spokesman and runner-up to Charles Kennedy in last year's leadership contest. He called for the creation of a Community Safety Constabulary to support the police, as well as a 6,000 increase in police numbers. But the significant news was his announcement that Liberal Democrat peers will vote against the second reading of legislation restricting the right of people charged with certain offences to elect to be tried by jury. Hughes's attack on what he called \"this disgraceful and unjustified\" bill not only went down well with delegates, but means that the bill is almost certain to be defeated in the upper house. One attempt to push the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) Bill through Parliament has already been thwarted by peers worried about its effect on civil liberties. Earlier, Liberal Democrats gave a standing ovation to the general secretary of the TUC, John Monks. His speech stood out for its enthusiastic pro-Europeanism: stronger than he had offered at the TUC's own conference last week.

Research into non-drug interventions shows promising results for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), as well as support and education for patients and families, but little or no benefit from other interventions. </p> <p> <strong> Cognitive behavioural therapy</strong> </p> <p> CBT is offered by clinical psychologists for many mental health problems, but is not widely available for schizophrenia. It works by encouraging the patient to challenge patterns of negative thinking, which lead to distress, and to develop ways of thinking more positively. A review analysing trials of CBT for schizophrenia found that 20% fewer people relapse within 18 months when CBT is added to standard care, it improves symptoms such as hallucinations, and is well liked by patients. </p> <p> <strong> Cognitive rehabilitation</strong> </p> <p> This fairly experimental therapy uses tests to help people improve memory, attention and other aspects of thinking.

      "bodyText": "Drugs are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia but they are usually combined with some form of talking therapy. Research into non-drug interventions shows promising results for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), as well as support and education for patients and families, but little or no benefit from other interventions. Cognitive behavioural therapy CBT is offered by clinical psychologists for many mental health problems, but is not widely available for schizophrenia. It works by encouraging the patient to challenge patterns of negative thinking, which lead to distress, and to develop ways of thinking more positively. A review analysing trials of CBT for schizophrenia found that 20% fewer people relapse within 18 months when CBT is added to standard care, it improves symptoms such as hallucinations, and is well liked by patients. Cognitive rehabilitation This fairly experimental therapy uses tests to help people improve memory, attention and other aspects of thinking. Only small studies have been carried out, showing no clinical benefit. Psychodynamic/analytical therapy Most psychiatrists argue that psychoanalysis is unhelpful for schizophrenia. Some small, fairly old, studies of this approach show that psychoanalysis leads to people actually spending longer in hospital than medication and is even worse than doing nothing. Token economies Using tokens as rewards to attempt to change people's behaviour is another fairly old approach, although still used on some psychiatric wards. Limited research shows it can improve symptoms such as poor concentration, which even drugs rarely help. Education and support Various forms of support are usually offered to people suffering from schizophrenia and their families. Large studies show that providing support, information and coping strategies for individual patients reduces their risk of relapse. Providing families with similar support also reduces relapse rates. Other treatment There has been no useful research so far on the benefits of teaching life skills, to promote independent living, to people suffering schizophrenia.

A full-page portrait opposite a punchy think piece. Nothing unusual about that - the prime minister's sister-in-law is no shrinking violet - but what really did catch the eye was the ashtray, the packet of Marlboro Lights, the lighter and the swirling smug of bluewhite smoke, curling up and over her swollen Schiaparelli-pink belly. \"I can almost hear your gasps of disgust and your tuts of derision,\" wrote Booth, for yes, she is breaking the cardinal rule of political correctness: she is smoking while with child. </p> <p>The tone of Booth's piece was, of course, defiant. Women always used to smoke while pregnant - they say it did their children no harm. She smokes barely half a dozen a week - hardly a hanging offence. In fact, she said, her midwife was surprisingly sanguine about it, telling her: \"Oh don't worry too much, it's the heavy smokers we worry about.\" Lauren told how the kind of men who wouldn't give up their seat on the Tube for her would berate her about the \"fag\" in her mouth. All interesting points. </p> <p>Yet how profoundly shocking that picture was! And the headline -\"Puff Mummy\" - golly! What will wild Lauren (she also admits to the odd glass of wine) be up to next? </p> <p>Which is curious really, because a lot of pregnant women smoke in this country: around one in four of them. That's 150,000 women a year . These women continue to do so in the face of campaign after campaign on the evils of smoking. They will tell you that they are addicted; that smoking is one of their greatest pleasures; that they simply do not believe that the odd fag can really do that much damage to their child; that they have cut down, they are making an effort, at least; that their mother smoked while pregnant with them, for God's sake; that they smoked with their first child and he was fine... all the same interesting points that Ms Booth was making, really. </p> <p>It's just that, on the whole, we don't see these women: they tend to be the poorest among us and they don't get a picture spread in a magazine to explain why they are smoking while pregnant. All that is truly shocking about the Booth picture and article is that (a) we don't normally see pictures of pregnant women smoking and (b) she is a well-connected, middle-class young woman: the kind of girl who buys organic food and goes to yoga and totally freaks out and transforms every aspect of her life when she gets pregnant because It's The Biggest Thing That Ever Happened To Anyone. </p> <p>So how bad is it, smoking while pregnant? The answer is that if you smoke very little, there will probably be no detectable effect on your unborn child. That doesn't mean there won't be an impact on your child's health or development: it means any impact will probably be undetectable. </p> <p>With women who smoke heavily, the effects tend to be more obvious. Babies tend to be smaller. They are more at risk of deformities. They are more prone to asthma. They might be less clever. They are more likely to die in their cot. They are more prone to lung disease as adults... And, of course, the mother is more likely to miscarry. Another serious problem is that a woman who cannot quit while pregnant is unlikely to quit while breastfeeding or as her child grows up. </p> <p>It is true that many women smoke while pregnant and produce a healthy baby. The problem is that they'll never know if their baby might have been taller, or brighter, or, in the long-term, less susceptible to cancer. Ms Booth is not a criminal, she is simply taking a tiny risk with her baby's health. Some may dismiss her article as irresponsible but the fact is that she is an addict and, who knows, perhaps her words will have given some comfort to all the pregnant women out there who don't keep it down to six fags a week.

      "body": "<p> I was diagnosed with cancer in April 1998 while living in Westchester County, just north of New York, with my husband David. I was 30 years old and 18 weeks pregnant with our first child. The pregnancy had progressed normally up until then: I was enjoying being pregnant and, ironically, felt the healthiest I had ever felt. </p> <p>When breast cancer was diagnosed, I was initially told I should terminate my pregnancy (I would need surgery and, besides, if there had been considerable cancer spread I would need chemotherapy immediately). It became obvious that statistics for long-term life expectancy for women like me were not very good, mainly because by the time there is a diagnosis, the cancer is usually fairly advanced. </p> <p>Fortunately for me, I was referred to a consultant who specialises in cancer in pregnant women. He did not advise a termination, but instead suggested we wait until we had determined how advanced the cancer was. It turned out that there had been no spread to the lymph nodes; I was able to continue with the pregnancy and wait until after my baby was born to have chemotherapy. </p> <p>I'm very happy to say that Max survived six hours of surgery and was born four months later on August 17, 1998, five weeks prematurely, at Queen Charlotte's hospital, London. (We were relocated back there shortly after my surgery.) </p> <p>Having cancer forces you to deal with all sorts of issues, like writing your will and deciding where you want to be buried. Being pregnant and having cancer means you don't have the luxury of the colour scheme of the baby's nursery being the most crucial decision you make. You must think about the next 20 years and plan for your child's welfare, taking into account that you may not be around to oversee their maturity. I feel cheated that my pregnancy was not all baby showers and ribbons, but also feel fortunate that I now fully realise the awesome responsibilty of bringing a child into this world. </p> <p>Until a cure for cancer is found, it can return anytime, and next time I might not sail through the surgery and chemotherapy, leaving my son to grow up without a mother. Max has just started nursery and he cries when I say goodbye to him every morning. It pains me to think that one day I might not be coming back at the end of the day to pick him up. Who will console him then, when it is only his mother's embrace that will comfort him? </p> <p>I have been very lucky, so far at least, but I often wonder what would have happened to me if we'd been living in the UK at the time. Would the doctors here have been able to diagnose the cancer so early? Or because I do not fall into any of the supposed high risk groups, especially being so young and pregnant, would I have been turned away? </p> <p>Lack of resources in the UK means that the professionals work with their hands tied - they may be aware that there could be a problem but are unable to waste vital time and equipment on testing and treating people who may turn out to be red herrings. Bad luck if you happen to be a very unusual statistic like me. </p> <p>Fortunately, I wasn't in Britain - God bless America - and a whirlwind of referrals and second and third opinions followed my diagnosis. It was only a week after the diagnosis that I was admitted into the New York Cornell Hospital for a mastectomy. </p> <p>I don't want to be unfair about the standard of medical care in Britain, because since my return to London in August 1998, it has been fantastic. But am I just lucky? My doctor in New York used to work with my doctor in London, so I got referred to the best cancer specialist's list in this country. Professor Ian Smith and his team at the Royal Marsden are incredible - but what happens when your GP is not so well connected? Fewer women would die from breast cancer if they received the treatment they needed and deserved. Early diagnosis is vital. </p> <p>Having faced up to my own mortality I wanted to do something for my son, something that would make him proud. So I decided to compile a book, and contacted several women who I knew had also experienced cancer. These women took a giant leap of faith when they shared their experiences with me for the book, but women facing the same diagnosis can take comfort in the fact that others have been there before them and survived. I am certainly motivated and encouraged by their tremendous zest for living. When I started to research and write All Woman it was that very enthusiasm and positiveness that was missing in the media and how the media dealt with cancer and survivors. </p> <p>Indeed, in every article on cancer the word victim always appeared. I have come across many people who have experienced cancer and the only word that doesn't describe them is victim. They are courageous and wise, leaders and motivators, achievers and visionaries. They are a special group of people. Every cancer story is unique, yet a common thread bonds each of us together. When I was asked to share my thoughts and insights about cancer I thought, \"Easy, I've been there, seen it, done it - even written the book and got the T-shirt.\" However, it took a week of procrastination before I eventually sat down to write. </p> <p>Cancer, in any of its forms touches your life in so many unimaginable ways. Dealing with cancer or a life threatening illness makes you realise your own true strength. It is actually quite a blessing to know just how much you can tolerate. It is liberating to know that you can take on the world and win; that the human body is capable of such great renewal. Ignorance and fear of cancer gives it the power to destroy. Understanding, knowledge and trust in ourselves instills the power to heal. </p> <p>\u0095 Tania Farrell Yelland's book, All Woman, is published by Metro Books priced \u00a39.99, available in bookshops from September 21 or by calling the credit card hotine 0500 418419.Readers interested in raising funds for Breakthrough's breast cancer research can join the charity's \u00a31,000 Challenge by calling Paula Bennett on 020-7557 6611.</p>",

He has been very fat since I can remember, though our mother dates his weight gain from the removal of his tonsils at the age of five. </p> <p>Family photographs show a progression from normal stockiness at two, through childhood chubbiness, to frank fatness by 10. From then on, he is notably large in all but his wedding photographs. For the love of a good woman, Mo slimmed down. </p> <p>He still loves her and has three (slim) children with her. But the weight has piled back on, and now Mo is desperate. He has tried the lot: diets, counselling, swimming 50 lengths a night, jaw wiring and liquid-only diets. Now he wants an operation. A quick-fix, long-term, irreversible solution that will shift the blubber for ever. \"I'm 39 now and weigh about 140kg that I'll admit to. I'm finding it harder to move around now and that frightens me,\" says Mo. </p> <p>\"I had my jaw wired twice and lost around eight stone each time.

I react best to mechanical solutions but the jaw wiring was too short-term for me, which is why I'm considering surgery.\" </p> <p>Professor John Baxter is one of only a handful of surgeons in the UK who regularly performs obesity surgery.

There seems to be an attitude that obesity is a self-imposed condition caused by lack of self-control. But it is a metabolic disease, like diabetes, and needs treating.

If he opts for surgery he stands a one in 100 risk of dying as a result of the operation. If he remains as obese as he is now, he has only a one in seven chance of reaching his normal life expectancy and has a high probability of developing diabetes, joint pains, high blood pressure predisposing him to stroke and heart attacks, acid reflux, asthma and urinary incontinence. </p> <p>Dr Pierre Bouloux, consultant endocrinologist at the Royal Free Hospital in London, understands why people like Mo opt for surgery, but he sounds a note of caution. \"Surgery is no better or worse than wearing a tight belt round your midriff. In the fullness of time, surgery will be seen as rather barbaric as we develop better drugs to speed up energy expenditure or ways of modifying the gene defects that cause extreme obesity. It's unlikely we'll ever have one drug to suit everyone because there are at least 20 different genes involved, as well as differences in eating behaviour.\" Bouloux recommends a 650-calorie-a-day liquid diet of one litre of semi-skimmed milk, fresh orange juice and vitamins. </p> <p>He favours wiring the jaws so you can't eat solid food in the event that willpower alone is not enough. Drugs such as metformin, used to increase the body's sensitivity to insulin, and orlistat, which prevents the absorption of fat from the diet, can also be offered. </p> <p>But prof Baxter says the success rate after surgery is better than any of these measures. There are three main operations in current use; bypassing the stomach so that food isn't absorbed, putting a band round the stomach, or stapling across it to reduce stomach capacity drastically. </p> <p>Bypass surgery remains the gold standard, according to Baxter. But both bypass and stapling the stomach involve a major operation and a large incision. Banding the stomach by putting an inflatable band round the top of the stomach can be done by keyhole surgery. </p> <p>The band is inflated by injecting a small chamber which is implanted in the abdominal muscle. The staples or band reduce the volume of the stomach so that it can hold only tiny amounts at a time; overfill it and you vomit. \"If you cheat, you chunder,\" says New Zealand-born Baxter. </p> <p>The results are good; most will lose 60-70% of their excess weight, although Baxter warns that few ever reach normal weight. And 90% of a US series of patients followed up for 10 years managed to maintain their weight loss. \"There are some oddballs who liquidise Mars bars and so on and could out-eat any operation. But they are the exception,\" says Baxter. Most will lose over half their excess weight, but at a price. </p> <p>In a recent fiery editorial in the British Medical Journal, Baxter quoted a Swedish study comparing 2,000 obese patients treated with surgery with 2,000 treated with drugs. He says surgery has been shown to be overwhelmingly better than drugs in improving quality of life, curing diabetes, controlling high blood pressure, improving rates of employment and reducing costs to the health service. He asks why fewer than 200 operations a year are carried out in the UK and blames the lack of specialist training for surgeons in obesity surgery and society's ignorance and prejudice.

Baxter wants to see an obesity surgeon, supported by a team of specialist dieticians, psychologists, anaesthetists and nurses, in every large hospital in the country. </p> <p>The operations are not a quick fix. They represent a life sentence of never being able to eat normally, having to nibble at tiny morsels at family occasions and meals out with friends. It means forever forgoing the pleasures of a good meal.

      "bodyText": "Morris is my brother, affectionately known in the family as Mo. He has been very fat since I can remember, though our mother dates his weight gain from the removal of his tonsils at the age of five. Family photographs show a progression from normal stockiness at two, through childhood chubbiness, to frank fatness by 10. From then on, he is notably large in all but his wedding photographs. For the love of a good woman, Mo slimmed down. He still loves her and has three (slim) children with her. But the weight has piled back on, and now Mo is desperate. He has tried the lot: diets, counselling, swimming 50 lengths a night, jaw wiring and liquid-only diets. Now he wants an operation. A quick-fix, long-term, irreversible solution that will shift the blubber for ever. \"I'm 39 now and weigh about 140kg that I'll admit to. I'm finding it harder to move around now and that frightens me,\" says Mo. \"I had my jaw wired twice and lost around eight stone each time. But when the wires came off, I gradually regained the weight over a year or so. I react best to mechanical solutions but the jaw wiring was too short-term for me, which is why I'm considering surgery.\" Professor John Baxter is one of only a handful of surgeons in the UK who regularly performs obesity surgery. He is apoplectic in his rage over the paucity of options available to people like my brother. \"Between 1% and 2% of the UK population is seriously obese, with a body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in metres, squared) over 40.

I get blinding headaches, tummy bloating and cramps from time to time. My GP seems to put it all down to stress but did, reluctantly, refer me to an allergy clinic which apparently has a two-year waiting list. I can't afford to go private. What advice could you give me? </p> <p><strong> A</strong><br>One third of the entire British population think they have an allergy and many are in the same position as you in finding it hard to get specific advice. The UK Food Standards Agency reckons that probably only 10% of would-be allergy sufferers actually do have a provable allergy. Many of us are sensitive to particular foods which you find out by trial and error. I know I get headaches and tummy pains when I eat breakfast cereal. If I avoid it, I'm OK and when I try it again, the symptoms return. That's all the proof I really need and there's no test that could prove it more effectively. Food allergies tend to cause swollen lips, tightening of the throat, vomiting or a rash within a few hours of eating the culprit. Adults with a particular food allergy, as opposed to sensitivity, are usually all too aware of their allergy and avoid that food like the plague. </p> <p><strong> Male menopause</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Q </strong><br>Is there such a thing as the male menopause? Is there a test for it? I'm a 50-year-old man who is finding life very difficult at the moment. I seem to lack motivation, sex drive or enthusiasm for anything at work or at home. How can I find out more? </p> <p><strong> A</strong><br>Forgive me for being pedantic, but obviously there is no such thing as a male menopause because the word means the cessation of periods and you can't cease what you never started. However, there's no doubt that as men get older, muscle turns to fat and the hormone that drives virility, testosterone, becomes less rampant. A blood test to check testosterone doesn't usually give you useful information because you can have normal blood levels but become less responsive to the effects of testosterone. Failing responsiveness to testosterone is a gradual process and affects everyone differently and unpredictably. The loss of enjoyment in life that you are experiencing is more likely to be due to depression than hormonal changes and you may feel you'd like to explore this further with a sympathetic partner, friend or health professional. </p> <p><strong> Cataract cures</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Q</strong><br> I've just been to my optician and was shocked to learn that I have a cataract. I'm 72 and had been aware that my eyesight wasn't as sharp as it had been, but with new glasses I've been managing fine. Will I need an operation? </p> <p><strong> A</strong><br>Cataracts are a thickening of the lens of the eye which leads to gradual loss of vision. You don't need an operation unless you want one and you probably won't want one until the cataract starts to interfere with your daily life. The surgery itself is one of the success stories of our age. Complications are rare and the success rate extremely high. </p> <p><strong> Morning sickness</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Q</strong> I'm two months pregnant and I can't cope with the morning sickness. Mine actually lasts most of the day and is making me feel wretched. I don't want to take any drugs, but I don't think I can cope with this much longer.<br> </p> <p><strong> A</strong><br>Eat little and often, avoid the more whacky cravings like pickled eggs which might make anyone nauseous, and don't let yourself get too tired. Ginger helps some people. Acupuncture has been shown to help and is safe in pregnancy. Nausea can be a sign of a urinary infection so you could take a urine sample to your GP or midwife to be checked. </p> <p>\u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help. If you have a question for Dr Robinson, email drann@dircon.co.uk or write to her c/o The Health Editor, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.

But their attitude to drugs is something the government needs to consider as new \u00a31m cabinet office research into the needs of female and ethnic minority drug users gets under way. At present, most services are stuck in a 70s time warp focused on the white male heroin user. </p> <p>Erin O'Mara, 30, a drug user for more than 15 years and editor of drug users' magazine Black Poppy, laughs at the idea that a token \u00a31m from the government can plug the gaps in services for women. Nor does she believe it will change the entrenched attitudes of those who wield power over female drug users - the doctors who may or may not write them a prescription, the social workers who may or may not let them keep their kids, the rehab staff who may or may not throw them out on to the streets if they fail to meet often unrealistic targets. </p> <p>Dr Chris Ford, chair of the Methadone Alliance, says women's terror of having their children taken away if they continue to use drugs is still the main reason they don't come forward. \"One of my passions is making people realise that drug user can equal good parent.\" </p> <p>O'Mara has drawn up a wish list that includes better detox and rehab services, along with access to female drug workers, of which there is a nationwide shortage. Male workers can sometimes play the knight in shining armour to \"save\" a woman from herself while at the same time they may be exploiting the vulnerability of chaotic addiction by adding sexual tension, implicit or explicit. </p> <p>Drugs worker Gary Sutton recalls a pretty, blonde, 23-year-old who sought help with a heroin problem. \"She was young and attractive and had a job, so her male key worker decided she could be saved and gave her a prescription for detox drugs to wean her off heroin. In fact she wanted methadone to allow her to attain some stability and sort her life out. Without this, she relapsed and 'failed' the programme.\" </p> <p>This emphasis on passing the detox test as if it were a handful of GCSEs means women, particularly those with children, must passively accept an ever-reducing amount of prescription methadone from the NHS. Meanwhile they may be \"double scripting\" in the private sector because they can't function without drugs but know they must play the game and appear to cut down if they don't want to lose their children. One female heroin user, Lisa Davies, was so disenchanted with drug treatment services that last month she declined a community punishment for shoplifting to fund her habit and asked the court instead to send her to jail as she saw this as her only hope of getting clean and keeping her children. </p> <p> It's not only the professionals who rank drug users. There's a hierarchy within the community, too, with male aristocratic cocaine users at the top of the pyramid and female crack users in the gutter with the solvent abusers. </p> <p>\"A female drug user gains points from her male peers if she's young and attractive. Good earning power and the ability to keep her mouth shut if she gets busted by the police are also desirable attributes,\" Sutton says. </p> <p>Often a drug-using woman will have a dealer for a boyfriend, so is unlikely to access any services because she will be getting a regular supply. But in a mirror of the docile 50s housewife who was handed weekly housekeeping money by her officebound husband, the dominant man will often control his girlfriend's drug use. </p> <p>\"We call it powder power,\" O'Mara says. \"You sometimes see a 60-year-old drug dealer wearing an attractive 20-year-old on his arm like a handbag. She can't argue with him in case she doesn't get her fix that night. He decides when she's going to get her hit and holds it back if she is too sleepy to have sex with him.\" </p> <p>You very rarely see women dealers, according to Sutton. \"It's just too dangerous for them and they would be targeted by male gangs. Men have more drug career opportunities. Women's options are pretty limited - shoplifting or prostitution.\" </p> <p>O'Mara adds: \"When a couple are using drugs and get into debt with their dealer, the boyfriend tends to send his girl along to flutter her eyelashes at him. Next thing she knows she's giving him a hand job to cancel the debt and prevent the dealer from breaking her boyfriend's legs, and that's how it starts.\" </p> <p>With crack use, the lowest point can be hit extremely quickly, Sutton says. \"Crack is the only drug with which the high and the comedown are almost simultaneous. It stimulates an instant need for sex and once a woman's money has disappeared and her life becomes sex for crack in a crackhouse, there's even less chance of her escaping from the cycle.\" </p> <p>Sue Noot, clinical services coordinator for Thames Gateway NHS Trust Addiction Services, says women-specific issues around drug use have been ignored for too long. \"Women tend to get unhealthier more quickly than men. Their veins collapse faster, they are more likely to develop abscesses and one of the things some of them like about using drugs is that they lose weight. If they go into rehab and put it back on, they can get very depressed. Those who do stop using often relapse just before they have a period if they're suffering from PMT. This is almost never taken into account by services.\" </p> <p>O'Mara urges the government to listen to women. \"By choosing drugs, women are going against their socially prescribed role as selfless nurturers. Our behaviour is perceived as selfish, deviant and criminal. But we have the same needs and rights as others to be treated with care, understanding and dignity. Drugs tsar Keith Hellawell says that listening to users is a central plank of his 10-year strategy. Women need to speak up and the government must start listening.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The latest Guardian/ICM opinion poll published today gives the Tories a shock four-point lead and indicates that last week's petrol crisis has plunged Tony Blair into a deeper political hole than even the weekend polls suggested. It puts the Conservatives on 38% - up four points - and Labour on 34%, its lowest ICM rating since January 1992. The massive slide in Labour's fortunes - down 10 points on last month's 44% - is a bitter blow to the prime minister who might have expected to see some kind of recovery as the petrol began to flow back to the pumps over the weekend when the survey's fieldwork was done. But the detailed survey findings show that the government completely lost the argument over fuel prices. The poll also shows that the surprising political winners out of the fuel crisis are proving to be the Liberal Democrats who have made up as much ground as the Tories. The five point rise in their fortunes - from a static 17% - indicates that as many disaffected Labour voters regard Charles Kennedy's party as the next best thing to Labour as those who see the Conservatives as a credible alternative. It means the Liberal Democrats this week face their biggest political opportunity for more than a decade. The shock for Mr Blair is that the two polls published on Sunday - carried out by Mori and NOP - were taken towards the end of the storm on Thursday and Friday and he could have reasonably expected an almost instant recovery in his party's fortunes. But this third poll shows that Labour support fell further during the weekend as people reflected on the impact of the crisis on their lives. Even more worrying for Mr Blair is the fact that the details of the poll results show that the disaffection of former Labour voters is not confined to the petrol issue alone. Mr Blair's own personal rating has taken an even sharper dive. His approval rating as prime minister stood at plus two in July in the immediate aftermath of Gordon Brown's announcement of massive extra funds for health and education.

While Mr Blair's popularity once transcended party loyalties, it is now found only among core Labour voters - 69% of whom say he is doing a good job.

      "bodyText": "A \u00a3100m government scheme is published today to ensure that everyone has access to an NHS dentist by next year. Dentists will be offered new incentives to see NHS patients rather than carry out more lucrative private work. Around four million people in the UK do not have access to an NHS dentist, the British Dental Association claims. NHS dentists have become like gold dust around the country since dentists voted with their feet some years ago. Many opted to offer private services only while some offered to see young children on the NHS-on condition that their parents were seen privately. Some stalwarts continued to offer dental services on the NHS, but bemoaned the paperwork and, more worryingly, the inferior materials that they had to use when filling NHS teeth as opposed to private cavities. Now the government has woken up to the inevitable consequences; the nation's teeth are rotting, as those with the poorest dental hygiene struggle to find dental care they can afford. Four million people don't have access to a dentist at present and you can bet your bottom dollar that those are the four million who need it most. Dental checkups save expensive fillings and dental work; they are cost effective for the taxpayer and most of us would far rather let the dentist look in our mouths twice a year and have a quick scrape and polish, than have to suffer the drill. Preventive dentistry is a good thing, as are free, regular eye checks to screen for glaucoma in over 50s. But are all health checks worthwhile? You can definitely have too much of a good thing with some tests raising more anxiety than they are worth. An increasing number of companies now pay for their employees to have private health checks. And all GP surgeries offer a health check when you join a new practice. Pharmacies and health food shops offer all sorts of testing opportunities - instant pulse checks, blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes and bowel cancer kits. You can even send your hair off to private labs that claim to check for vitamin and mineral deficiencies. There is seemingly no end to the number of practitioners willing to take your money to check your health. But health checks that offer a standardised battery of tests may be ignoring the problems that you are most at risk of developing while offering other tests that don't give you useful information. To be useful to you, preventive tests and health checks need to be targeted to you as an individual. Everyone over the age of 20 benefits from a blood pressure check every five years; women on the pill or HRT and anyone whose blood pressure has been raised in the past or has a family history of heart disease should have it checked more regularly-say, annually. Blood tests for diabetes, high cholesterol, raised PSA indicating possible prostate cancer don't need to be carried out on everyone - the need and frequency of testing will depend on individual susceptibility to a condition. Specific screening for breast, cervical and bowel cancer is a good idea if you are at risk. The National Screening programmes offering breast and cervical cancer at regular intervals for all, regardless of their level of risk, are fairly crude ways of trying to pick up these diseases at a very early stage. In time, we are likely to be offered screening at intervals that reflect our level of risk. In all probability, low-risk women will be offered a smear every 10 years, and high-risk women every year. So yes, preventive tests can be useful but you need to ask your GP or medical adviser some specific questions; with my history, which tests should I have done and when? The ideal preventive medicine package is like a well made suit - all your measurements and requirements should be fully discussed, your vital statistics should be carefully recorded, and it should be tailor made to fit you and your needs. The worst sort of testing gives you meaningless results, false reassurance and unnecessary anxiety. No testing is better than bad testing.",

The \"part parlour game, part Domesday survey\", launched several months ago by Bob Geldof, drew 15,000 emails and postcards in the search for Britain's best words.</p> <p>In second place came quidditch, a word from the modern fairy tale of Harry Potter. This is the game played by the wizards and witches; it is similar to two existing English words, quiddity and quidnunc - but these never caught on.</p> <p>Between them, Walpole and JK Rowling pushed love into third place. The words peace and why tied for fourth place.</p> <p>A Greek-derived word cherished from school English lessons, onomatopoeia - an even longer tongue-twister than serendipity - took fifth place. It means words like hiss, buzz or bang whose sound imitates the action they describe. Its high placing will briefly lift the morale of teachers and school inspectors.</p> <p>Hope and faith were fifth and sixth, with charity nowhere.</p> <p>But it is perhaps the nine words at the bottom of yesterday's top words list that most tersely catch the mass millennial national mood.

      "bodyText": "Serendipity, that mellifluously long and happy noun has emerged as the nation's favourite word. The 18th century term, coined by the writer Horace Walpole for \"the faculty of making fortunate discoveries by accident\" - he had just read the Persian fairy tale, The Three Princes of Serendip - came top in a poll devised by the Word Festival of Literature, which starts next week at the Globe theatre, Bankside, London. The \"part parlour game, part Domesday survey\", launched several months ago by Bob Geldof, drew 15,000 emails and postcards in the search for Britain's best words. In second place came quidditch, a word from the modern fairy tale of Harry Potter. This is the game played by the wizards and witches; it is similar to two existing English words, quiddity and quidnunc - but these never caught on. Between them, Walpole and JK Rowling pushed love into third place. The words peace and why tied for fourth place. A Greek-derived word cherished from school English lessons, onomatopoeia - an even longer tongue-twister than serendipity - took fifth place. It means words like hiss, buzz or bang whose sound imitates the action they describe. Its high placing will briefly lift the morale of teachers and school inspectors. Hope and faith were fifth and sixth, with charity nowhere. But it is perhaps the nine words at the bottom of yesterday's top words list that most tersely catch the mass millennial national mood. They are football, muggle, hello, family, bollocks, compassion, fuck, home, Jesus, money. Among other also-rans in the competition was a nomination by the Men Behaving Badly scripwriter, Simon Nye, that appears to be dripping with the frustrations of a 1960s single-sex public school education: nipples. Barbara Windsor, the actress, failed to score with darling - meaning, she said, \"I can't for the life of me remember your name\". Kermit the Frog suggested Hi Ho for the same reason. The satirist and cartoonist Ralph Steadman lobbied for his new word entwangled, \"Combining entangled and entwined which suggests an amorous embrace between,\" he wrote. The most erudite celebrity nomination was forwarded by the pop singer Sting for the word laconic, \"an adjective derived from the Greek that originally described the people of Sparta who were famously taciturn and given to short pithy phrases. Cocktail banter was not big in Sparta\". The top 10 words chosen were: 1 serendipity 2 quidditch 3 love 4 peace = why 5 onomatopoeia 6 hope 7 faith 8 football = muggle = hello = family 9 bollocks = compassion = fuck = home 10 jesus = money \u0095 The Word Festival of Literature runs from September 23 at the Globe Theatre, Bankside, SE1. \u0095 The Word official website \u0095 Win tickets for The Word",

      "bodyText": "As tens of thousands of anti-globalisation protesters begin descending on the Czech capital for the International Monetary Fund/World Bank annual meeting which opens later this week, city officials say they feel as if they are preparing for war. Tear-gas equipment has been procured from Germany and water cannons that have not been used since the Velvet Revolution of 1989 have been brought out of the store-cupboard. Schools are to be closed, hospitals are stocking up with medicines to treat chemical weapon injuries and the post office says it cannot guarantee deliveries. Many of Prague's 1.2m citizens are planning to up and leave the city during the gathering, which takes place from September 19 to 28. Theatres that have only just reopened after the summer break are being forced to close, and staff at banks in the city have been warned to dress in casual attire so that they do not make themselves potential protest targets. ''We hope,'' said the 30-year old Czech Interior Minister Stanislav Gross, whose political future is dependent on the success or failure of the summit, ''that the biggest criticism they can levy at us is that we went over the top with our preparation. ''Only we'd rather be safe than sorry.'' But as hundreds of protesters - up to 25,000 are expected - found themselves being turned away at the border in the past few days, a spokesman for the Initiative Against Economic Globalisation (INPEG), an organisation preparing many of the protests, said the police approach reminded him of the communist era. ''This shows that police practices are getting back to how they used to be 15 years ago,'' Viktor Piorecky said. The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia announced its ''disgust'' that protesters were being banned from entering the country. ''Our party will ask the interior ministry to explain how Prague will secure people's freedom to speak out on the IMF,'' said a spokesman. A newspaper editorial ran: ''By limiting the freedom of other people, we are limiting our own freedom and this is the cost of our fear.'' Police say that they are well prepared for the planned mass demonstrations, marches, and plans to barricade state offices and high-profile businesses. ''Our main aim is to ensure that the conference can go on without delegates being affected by what's happening outside,'' said police president Jiri Kolar, who is coordinating the operation. Various \"hotspots\" have been identified by police where protesters are expected to gather in force. All of Prague's 22 branches of McDonald's are being viewed as prime targets for the demonstrators' wrath. Mr Kolar said that the police are prepared to tolerate non-violent protests, but he admitted that they had imposed tough document checks and car searches to keep ''undesirables'' out. This weekend, they face the added headache of having to keep an eye on protests against the activation of Temelin, an internationally-condemned, Soviet-designed nuclear power station in southern Bohemia, as well as the arrival of 15,000 music lovers for Prague's first WOMAD world music festival. The Czech police has faced criticism in recent years for the way in which it has handled May Day riots in Prague, during which windows of fast food restaurants and butchers' were smashed and several people were injured. To ensure they appear more accountable and responsible, they have accepted the presence of 100 volunteer legal observers who will report back to superiors if they violate human rights. A hotline has also been set up where people can report incidents of abuse of power. INPEG plans two non-violent counter summits on September 24 and 26. The latter, known in activist-speak as \"S26\", will be by far the biggest. Protesters will march from Prague's Namesti Miru (or Peace Square), to the summit's venue, the Congress Centre in the south of Prague. Under communism the centre was the Palace of Culture, and has been renamed and renovated at a cost of millions of dollars for this month's event. INPEG insists that it has nothing to do with a movement calling itself Destroy IMF, which tells protesters how to say ''Fuck off you fascist pig'' and ''where's the nearest McDonald's?'' in Czech. But the police say that the real ''acid test'' for them will be the first major protests on September 23. Then, Ludowik Zifcak, a former secret police officer who was jailed for 18 months in 1989 for abuse of public office during the protests in the run-up to the Velvet Revolution, will lead his extremist group, United Front. Zifcak represents one end of the spectrum of the extremists who will come to Prague. He has expressed his extraordinarily ambitious aim to bring together all sides in a common alliance against IMF and WB policies. ''We have started talks with Czech anarchists, skinheads and patriotic associations whose opinions are similar to ours,'' he said. He plans to hold demonstrations everyday between September 23 and 29. On the same day, Czech president Vaclav Havel will also attempt to unite all sides for a discussion group at Prague Castle. The man who has optimistically described the summit as ''a unique opportunity in the history of our country, and one that will possibly never be repeated,'' has invited 300 people from government, the IMF, World Bank and NGOs to discuss the issues of world poverty and globalisation. The discussion will be chaired by the UN commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, and will be attended by IMF executive director Horst Koehler, World Bank president James Wolfensohn and Ann Pettifor, director of the British organisation Jubilee 2000. It will be carried live, in Czech, on the internet at Praha 2000. Mr Havel's spokesman, Vladislav Spacek, also announced that the president was to take the bold step of delivering a speech at the opening of S26, thus endorsing what could turn into a full-scale riot, after protesters said that Prague 2000 would become \"Seattle 2\". Czech white supremicist groups have actually expressed their fear that they will become targets of violence for rival anarchist groups, whom they say will greatly outnumber them. Some far-right groups have even asked for police protection. Officials at the US Embassy in Prague, however, have expressed their private fear that better-resourced far-right groups from neighbouring countries, particularly Germany, could make a bee-line for Prague in the coming days. Czech-based skin-head groups such as National Resistance, National Alliance, the Patriotic Republican Party and Defence of the Nation, have lodged an application to hold a demonstration on September 23, on Letna Plain, in the north of the city. But already some of the 215 protest applications that have been lodged with the City Hall in Prague, look to be under threat. Miroslava Studenovska, the major of the Prague 4 Nusle district, where the summit venue is located, said that she had had no choice but to ban protests in the district and block off green areas. ''Instead we have established a coordination centre which will be in operation from now until early October. A free telephone number has also been made available to provide citizens with necessary information,'' she said. Those arriving in Prague yesterday from all over Europe were being given flyers in Czech, English, French, German and Spanish. \"Read before demonstrations'\", the leaflets said. The flyers list protesters' rights according to Czech law, inform them about the status of foreigners and offer useful telephone numbers. Fifteen thousand camping places have been made available for protesters at Strahov Stadium, a huge former communist monstrosity big enough to fit five football pitches, which, these days, is normally just home to a drive-in cinema. So far, 5,000 people have booked places for the temporary tent city via the internet. Others will stay at Dzuban campground in the north east of the city or in various squats dotted around Prague. On Saturday, journalists were informed just two hours before of the location outside Prague where demonstration management techniques were being practised. The boot camp, on a rundown farm, 30 miles outside Prague, has been home for the past few days of 250 activists, who have been taught how to behave in demonstrations, as well as the techniques of tree-climbing and samba. On Tuesday they will move to a secret location in Prague.",

However, all AOL users will have been offered the service by the end of November, according to Matt Peacock, director of corporate communications at AOL UK. \"It's going to be a fast roll-out. Now it all depends on BT to deliver its FRIACO promises. What happens from here on is down to BT,\" he said. The AOL Flat Rate is being offered as an alternative to AOL's \u00a39.99 subscription service, which does not include any free internet calls. It is thought that customers of CompuServe, the AOL-owned ISP aimed at businessmen, will be offered a similar FRIACO service in the near future. AOL would not provide figures for how many subscribers it expects to sign up to the service, or how many UK subscribers AOL has. However, the company said it would be able to connect \"hundreds of thousands\" to the Flat Rate service.",

It was the start of \"an important week in this campaign\", he admitted in a speech in Little Rock, \"a week that speaks to the aspirations and hopes of middle-class families all across the nation.\" The visit to the maternity ward kicked off a determined effort by the Republicans to regain control of the election agenda from Vice-President Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, who continues to extend his recent lead in the opinion polls, not just nationally but in many of the states that will decide the election. \"This is a very focused, more aggressive effort to let voters know where Governor Bush stands on the major issues of the day,\" his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, told reporters before the start of the latest campaign swing.

      "body": "<p>Channel 4's Big Breakfast reached a new low yesterday when it scored the lowest viewing figures of all five channels.</p> <p>Just 500,000 people were watching the Big Breakfast at the peak early-morning time of 8am yesterday, giving the channel 100,000 fewer viewers than Channel 5's children's programmes and 200,000 fewer than BBC2's Breakfast 24. At 8am the once-popular show had a share of just 9% of the viewers compared with 24% for BBC1's Olympic Grandstand and 29% for ITV's GMTV. The figures will prove an embarrassment to Channel 4, which had been hoping for better things from its return to the star line-up of Johnny Vaughan and Denise Van Outen. And it rather begs the question of how low the ratings will drop when the pair leave at the end of this year.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the BBC's increasingly odd scheduling of Castaway continues to baffle and deter viewers in equal measure. BBC1 broadcast the show for just 20 minutes last night at 8.40pm, putting it up against ITV's smash hit Who Wants to be a Millionaire. No prizes for guessing who won. Castaway attracted just 6.4m viewers while nearly twice that number (11.4m) were watching ITV.</p> <p>A special 40-minute episode of EastEnders also suffered from a clash with ITV. The much-vaunted arrival of the Slater family to Albert Square gave the show a ratings fillip, with 11.9m people tuning in to give BBC1 a 49% share. But the figures tailed off in the final 10 minutes, as the show went head to head against Who Wants to be a Millionaire.</p> <p>It was a good night all round for ITV. Almost all the 9.4m people who watched the first part of its thriller, My Fragile Heart, stuck with it for last night's conclusion, which attracted 9.2m viewers to give it a 41% share.</p> <p>The BBC's Olympic Games coverage continues to prove popular in spite of scheduling difficulties caused by the time difference. The Day Downunder, an hour-long round-up of the day's sporting highlights, attracted 4.8m viewers when it was broadcast at 7pm to give BBC1 a very respectable 22% share. And the late-night Olympic Grandstand attracted 2.1m viewers, to give BBC1 a 39% share of the viewing - by far the best performance of all five channels at that time.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Channel 4's Big Breakfast reached a new low yesterday when it scored the lowest viewing figures of all five channels. Just 500,000 people were watching the Big Breakfast at the peak early-morning time of 8am yesterday, giving the channel 100,000 fewer viewers than Channel 5's children's programmes and 200,000 fewer than BBC2's Breakfast 24. At 8am the once-popular show had a share of just 9% of the viewers compared with 24% for BBC1's Olympic Grandstand and 29% for ITV's GMTV. The figures will prove an embarrassment to Channel 4, which had been hoping for better things from its return to the star line-up of Johnny Vaughan and Denise Van Outen. And it rather begs the question of how low the ratings will drop when the pair leave at the end of this year. Elsewhere, the BBC's increasingly odd scheduling of Castaway continues to baffle and deter viewers in equal measure. BBC1 broadcast the show for just 20 minutes last night at 8.40pm, putting it up against ITV's smash hit Who Wants to be a Millionaire. No prizes for guessing who won. Castaway attracted just 6.4m viewers while nearly twice that number (11.4m) were watching ITV. A special 40-minute episode of EastEnders also suffered from a clash with ITV. The much-vaunted arrival of the Slater family to Albert Square gave the show a ratings fillip, with 11.9m people tuning in to give BBC1 a 49% share. But the figures tailed off in the final 10 minutes, as the show went head to head against Who Wants to be a Millionaire. It was a good night all round for ITV. Almost all the 9.4m people who watched the first part of its thriller, My Fragile Heart, stuck with it for last night's conclusion, which attracted 9.2m viewers to give it a 41% share. The BBC's Olympic Games coverage continues to prove popular in spite of scheduling difficulties caused by the time difference. The Day Downunder, an hour-long round-up of the day's sporting highlights, attracted 4.8m viewers when it was broadcast at 7pm to give BBC1 a very respectable 22% share. And the late-night Olympic Grandstand attracted 2.1m viewers, to give BBC1 a 39% share of the viewing - by far the best performance of all five channels at that time.",

Cricket was last an Olympic Sport in 1900, when Great Britain - well, the Devon County Wanderers - beat France. And if the Australians can't sneak it in as an exhibition sport, nobody can. </p> <p>We should be grateful at least that the Women's World Cup isn't being held in our country. Our last opening ceremony didn't exactly wow those punters who bothered to turn up. Tony Blair cut the ribbon on a drizzly grey day in May. Well at least he was a cricket fan. Well, at least his microphone worked. Well at least the fireworks went off. Well ... </p> <p>And maybe the world's women cricketers will have the ultimate honour. Australia wouldn't or couldn't persuade Don Bradman out of retirement to light the Olympic flame. But perhaps he can be tempted by a lower profile, but less commercial, gig. It would instantly transfer the eyes of the cricket world to New Zealand. Women's cricket would never have had it so good. Go on Don, do the decent thing.

And if, as Colette Dowling suggests in her new book The Frailty Myth, there is no reason that women cannot eventually run as fast as men, the attention paid to women athletes during the Olympics can only grow. Unfortunately England's women cricketers are unlikely to be able to participate. Cricket was last an Olympic Sport in 1900, when Great Britain - well, the Devon County Wanderers - beat France. And if the Australians can't sneak it in as an exhibition sport, nobody can. We should be grateful at least that the Women's World Cup isn't being held in our country. Our last opening ceremony didn't exactly wow those punters who bothered to turn up. Tony Blair cut the ribbon on a drizzly grey day in May. Well at least he was a cricket fan. Well, at least his microphone worked. Well at least the fireworks went off. Well ... And maybe the world's women cricketers will have the ultimate honour. Australia wouldn't or couldn't persuade Don Bradman out of retirement to light the Olympic flame. But perhaps he can be tempted by a lower profile, but less commercial, gig. It would instantly transfer the eyes of the cricket world to New Zealand. Women's cricket would never have had it so good. Go on Don, do the decent thing. Light our fire.

Ich verziehe mich dann mit einem guten Buch in mein Zimmer und lese den ganzen Tag \u00fcber. Das ist f\u00fcr mich auch Entspannung. Vielleicht sogar mehr, als irgendwo am Baggersee in der Sonne zu brutzeln. Urlaub in Deutschland ist ein Urlaub ohne Wettergarantie. W\u00fcrdet ihr es trotzdem machen? Helga: Klar, habe ich heuer ja bewiesen. Und ich w\u00fcrde das auch jederzeit wieder machen. Deutschland hat so viele sch\u00f6ne Ecken. Die sind auch super, wenn es mal regnet. Und so schlimm war es in diesem Jahr doch auch nicht. Klar, man erinnert sich an den nassen Juli. Aber der August hat doch alles wieder herausgerissen. Regina: Ich denke schon. Man f\u00e4hrt ja zum Beispiel auch nach England oder Schweden, obwohl man genau wei\u00df, da\u00df dort nicht immer die Sonne vom Himmel brennt. Aber darauf kommt es im Urlaub ja auch gar nicht an. Wenn ich wegfahre, will ich etwas sehen, will mich am\u00fcsieren und mich erholen. Und das kann man in Deutschland genauso, wie in einem anderen Land. Wenn man nat\u00fcrlich nur am Strand liegen will, mu\u00df man sich das vorher \u00fcberlegen . . . Thomas: Logisch. Ist eigentlich ohnehin schade, da\u00df man sich in fremden L\u00e4ndern oft weniger auskennt als in der eigenen Heimat. Ich habe mir vorgenommen, in den n\u00e4chsten Jahren ein Bundesland nach dem anderen abzuklappern und mir mal anzuschauen, wie es dort so ist. Au\u00dferdem habe ich bei Urlaub in Deutschland den absoluten Vorteil, da\u00df mich jeder versteht und ich mich nicht in einer anderen Sprache zurechtfinden mu\u00df.

      "bodyText": "Guinness has struck upon a novel solution to the age-old problem of warm beer - funding a pub entirely made from ice as a stunt to promote its Extra Cold beer. The 9sq metre pub, made from 20 tonnes of ice in conditions of minus 18 degrees Celsius, is licensed to sell real pints to punters and will be on display at the Broadgate Centre in central London today. Ice sculptor Jonathan Lloyd is unconcerned that within five hours his creation will be reduced to water: \"The fact that it melts is part of the magic.\" Guinness will use the \u00a3250,000 ice-pub - equipped with ice stools, an ice dart board and an ice pool table - to advertise its draught Extra Cold beer. A Guinness spokeswoman said today that if technology developed, Britons could one day see ice pubs around the country promoting the beer.",

He wants to discredit us by provoking us into action before the 60 days is up and then turn round and say 'I told you so'. But I would appeal to the British public to maintain calm and give the man the benefit of the doubt.\"</p> <p>Mr Williams, vice-chairman of the Farmers' Union of Wales, added: \"I hope at the end of the 60 days he will show he has listened and responded. Mr Brown is like a cornered animal at the moment and is very dangerous; let's ensure he still has an escape route.\"</p> <p>Len Johnson, a spokesman for the hauliers who blockaded the Shell terminal at Jarrow, criticised Mr Brown for rejecting the protesters' deadline.</p> <p>\"It is political suicide if he does not do anything within the 60 days. It was a serious gesture and it was well thought about before it was made,\" he said. \"I am sure action will be taken if nothing happens.

      "bodyText": "The farmer who spearheaded the first fuel tax protest today accused the chancellor, Gordon Brown, of trying to provoke further demonstrations. Brynle Williams, who headed the six-day stand-off outside the Stanlow oil refinery in Cheshire, was reacting to the chancellor's rejection of the deadline imposed by protesters. The 51-year-old farmer described the chancellor's comments as \"antagonistic\" while a spokesman for the hauliers who blockaded the Shell terminal, at Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, said Mr Brown would be committing \"political suicide\" should he fail to act within 60 days. Mr Brown's defiant stance came as members of the government's new fuel task force sat down again to try to thrash out an agreement on how to secure supplies of petrol - and as a new poll showed Labour's support on the slide. Mr Williams said from his sheep and cattle farm in Cilcain, near Mold, north Wales: \"Gordon Brown is a very very silly man for making such an antagonistic public statement. \"The chancellor is trying to provoke a confrontation by saying he won't stick to our 60-day deadline. He wants to discredit us by provoking us into action before the 60 days is up and then turn round and say 'I told you so'. But I would appeal to the British public to maintain calm and give the man the benefit of the doubt.\" Mr Williams, vice-chairman of the Farmers' Union of Wales, added: \"I hope at the end of the 60 days he will show he has listened and responded. Mr Brown is like a cornered animal at the moment and is very dangerous; let's ensure he still has an escape route.\" Len Johnson, a spokesman for the hauliers who blockaded the Shell terminal at Jarrow, criticised Mr Brown for rejecting the protesters' deadline. \"It is political suicide if he does not do anything within the 60 days. It was a serious gesture and it was well thought about before it was made,\" he said. \"I am sure action will be taken if nothing happens. It would be different if he said 'let's get round the table and talk about it' and explain why he can't do anything within the 60 days.\" Mr Johnson expressed scepticism at the chancellor's claims that he was listening to the farmers and hauliers. \"He said he was listening to us years ago, but we have been demonstrating for the past two years now,\" he said. They have been trying to keep us sweet but we are not going to stand for it any more. We are wise to them now.\" The chancellor reiterated his hardline stance in an interview with the Times published today, in which he said: \"We are not going to make decisions on the basis of deadlines such as this. We have a process that works: the pre-Budget report and then the Budget.\" In an apparent rebuke to those colleagues calling for the government to be more responsive, he added: \"People do not want governments taking decisions because of something that has happened one week and changing their mind the next week.\" Three sub-committees were today trying again to determine how to keep petrol and diesel supplies flowing after yesterday's first full meeting of the government's fuel task force failed to reach agreement on either threatened new legislation to compel oil companies to keep supplies moving or a \"memorandum of understanding\". The toll the fuel crisis has taken on the government was underlined by a Guardian ICM poll which showed the Tories pulling further ahead of Labour. According to the survey, two-thirds of people blame the government for petrol price rises, and nearly three quarters say Labour is not a listening government. Mr Blair's personal satisfaction rating has plummeted from plus two in July to minus 34 now - the lowest rating for a Labour leader since Neil Kinnock's nadir of popularity in March 1989.",

In the absence of any firm evidence on the state of Saddam's health and his family relations, it is wise to suppose that he remains as powerful as ever and in full command of his faculties. We should look for another motive that makes sense, at least in Saddam's own terms. The oil markets are in a delicate state and depend, more than at any other time, on the continuity of supplies from Iraq. Iraq's two local enemies - Saudi Arabia and Kuwait - are among those endeavouring to bring prices down. For each $1 drop in the price of a barrel of oil, the value of Iraq's production falls by around $2.5m a day. By engineering an atmosphere of crisis in the Gulf, Iraq can create jitters in the market and keep prices high. It's easy to do and, unless Saddam actually resorts to military force, there's no risk to Iraq. Iraq, just like Saudi Arabia, is in a position to move markets, and there have even been suggestions in the past - which are difficult to prove - that it has used this to profit from insider trading. Manipulating the oil price by means of a largely fictitious crisis would bring economic benefits to Iraq, but there may be scope to exploit the current situation further. One way would be to contrive an interruption in the supply of Iraqi oil (on which the US particularly depends). Saddam is often attracted by politically symbolic gestures, and the idea of imposing his own sanctions on the west, as retribution for the events of the last 10 years, would certainly appeal to him. It would also strike a chord with popular opinion in many parts of the Arab and Islamic world. Such a move would cause oil prices to soar even further, wreaking havoc in much of the industrialised world, and especially in the United States in the midst of a presidential election. At the moment, the world does not have enough readily-available spare production capacity to compensate for the loss of Iraqi oil, which currently amounts to about 2.5m barrels a day. But if Saddam wanted to do that he would have to do it soon: there is only a small window of opportunity before increased production from elsewhere replenishes the stockpiles. It would certainly be a huge gamble by Iraq, and western analysts have generally discounted the idea on the grounds that Saddam would simply be punishing himself by cutting off his only source of real income. It might not, however, be as costly for Saddam as it looks. The high oil prices of the last few months have given Iraq an unexpected cash windfall - possibly enough to see the country through two or three months of zero revenue without abnormal hardship. A second factor to bear in mind is that the Iraqi regime receives only about half of the total revenue from its oil production. Apart from the deductions for compensation, a further 13 per cent of the money goes directly to the Kurdish areas, and some towards covering UN administration costs. If Iraq announced that it was imposing oil \"sanctions\" against the US and others, but was prepared to supply to friendly countries directly (outside the oil-for-food programme), it would therefore only need to sell half of its current production to break even. It might not succeed in that, but any oil that it did sell directly would be worth twice as much as normal. There would certainly be supply difficulties because this would break the UN embargo, but countries desperate for oil might not take kindly to US attempts to intercept the tankers. The political effect would be to create further rifts in what remains of the international consensus over Iraq. If the ploy succeeded, sanctions and the oil-for-food programme would be shot to smithereens. There is no certainty that Iraq will try it, and Saddam may judge that the risks outweigh his frustration over sanctions. But he would be missing a trick if he did not think about it seriously, and so would the west, if it did not consider how it might respond. brian.whitaker@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "More than 70% of all motorists had enough petrol to keep on driving throughout last week's fuel crisis, today's Guardian/ ICM poll reveals. It shows that 29% of motorists - or about 23% of the adult population, when those who do not have a car are included - ran so low on petrol that they had to give up using their car. The ICM poll findings suggest that Tony Blair's real political problem is that the dissatisfaction among the key swing voters is not confined to the issue of petrol prices but runs much deeper. Some 71% now say they do not believe ministers when they claim to be a \"listening\" government and Tony Blair's own approval rating as prime minister has taken an even sharper dive that the 10-point slide in New Labour's share of the vote, with his personal ratings slumping from plus two in the early summer to minus 34 points now. In July, in the immediate aftermath of Gordon Brown's injection of extra funds for health and education, Mr Blair had a positive approval rating, with 44% saying he was doing a good job compared with 42% dissatisfied with his performance as prime minister. The survey shows that the petrol crisis has triggered a massive loss of personal confidence in Mr Blair. Only 29% of voters think he is doing a good job - the lowest for a Labour leader since Neil Kinnock in March 1989 - and 63% are unhappy with his performance in Downing Street. The only group to retain faith in Mr Blair's abilities are Labour voters - some 69% of whom say they think he is doing a good job. A majority of Labour voters do think Mr Blair's is a listening govern ment - but even one third of Mr Blair's loyal supporters disagree with this. The detail of the poll shows that the government has lost nearly every key argument during the petrol crisis. The attempts of ministers to explain the role of Opec and the oil companies in the petrol price rises completely failed to convince voters. Some 63% firmly blamed the government, 17% blamed Opec, and only 12% blamed the petrol companies. The argument that petrol prices should be high to encourage drivers to leave their cars at home for environmental reasons has also completely failed to have any impact. Only 20% agree with the idea of such anti-pollution taxes, and 76% say petrol prices should be cut because they need their cars. The findings about how many people had to give up using their cars during the last week because they did not have any petrol show that 23% of all adults had to stop using their car, 56% said they carried on driving, and the remaining 21% said they did not have a car. When those who do not have a car are excluded, the results show that 29% of motorists had to stop driving because they did not have petrol, but 71% were able to carry on motoring. However, the real anxiety for Mr Blair must be that this poll - the third in the last three days showing that the Labour lead has disappeared overnight - could indicate the beginning of the kind of seismic shift in the political landscape that crippled the Tories eight years ago when the pound was forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism. It might have been expected that Labour's recovery would have started as soon as the petrol began to be delivered to the pumps once again. That has not proved to be the case. Mr Blair is now in a bigger electoral hole than even the weekend polls indicated. \u0095 ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,055 adults aged 18 and over by telephone between September 15 and 17.

The TGWU, which represents the majority of employed tanker drivers and played a key role in helping to bring the blockades to an end, is preparing a dossier of evidence for Tony Blair, detailing company and police inaction or connivance with the anti-fuel tax protests. But Mr Morris, responding to suggestions that the government is planning legislation requiring oil companies to maintain fuel supplies, made clear that he had not been consulted and that his union would not tolerate any move to restrict the right to strike for tanker drivers. \"The government should investigate why existing legislation was not effective before they rush to implement new laws,\" he said.

Reports from the union's tanker drivers' representatives, Mr Morris said, raised a questions about the blockades by owner drivers and farmers, including: \u0095 Why had protesters been given the run of restricted areas at Immingham depot near Hull when unions had been refused access, as they had at Fawley, to represent members? \u0095 Why, when protesters first appeared at the Stanlow depot in Cheshire and TGWU members working for P&amp;O told managers they would work normally if they were given police escorts, was no such support given? \u0095 Why did police take no action over film of drivers being threatened at Stanlow - some were told by demonstrators that their pictures would be posted on the internet. Mr Morris said BP had instructed TGWU drivers last week not to take tankers out - this in an industry ruthlessly quick to make wage deductions if drivers failed to carry out their contractual obligations. \"Why did the companies not invoke their contractual rights in getting deliveries out? \"Why didn't they take out injunctions?

      "bodyText": "Government plans to respond to last week's sudden petrol drought by imposing a new legal duty on oil companies to maintain supplies met fierce resistance from the companies and unions last night. In an effort to quell union protests about a possible removal of the right to strike, the industry secretary, Stephen Byers, wrote to the TUC to reassure the unions that any legal duty to ensure continuous supply of petrol would be imposed on employers, and not on the tankers drivers or their unions. The petrol companies said the scheme was probably unworkable, adding they would not instruct their workforce to cross the protest lines if there was any perceived threat to their safety. They added many of the tanker drivers were not in their direct employment. The controversy arose after the first meeting of a task force of ministers, police and oil firms set up to prevent a repetition of last week's crisis. When asked if the fuel crisis will ever happen again, Jack Straw, the home secretary, replied: \"It is a very rash minister who says something will never happen again but what we are working on is a very significant reduction of the risk of this kind of disruptive action.\" Ministers have said they want to extend the powers in the Energy Act 1976 which gives the government the right to order or regulate the supply of crude liquid petroleum, gas and electricity. Under this act ministers can ask the courts to impose unlimited fines on gas and electricity companies that fail to meet requirements to maintain supplies. Cabinet ministers said the oil companies were being much more constructive than expected, but added a general legal duty would put extra pressure to rearrange the supply chain. However, some of the oil companies pointed out that if no legal duty is placed on tanker drivers to work, there is no effective leverage on the companies to supply petrol. A legal duty already exists on oil companies to keep a fixed level of oil reserves in Britain, or abroad under bilateral agreements with foreign governments. Mr Straw said prior to any legislation, likely to be included in the Queen's speech, the government and oil firms would draw up a non-legal memorandum of understanding setting out each side's duties and responsibilities. The task force is in the short term to be split into three sub-committees - the first covering the potential legal duties on petrol suppliers, a second covering the degree of coordination between the oil firms, the police and Whitehall, and a third ensuring that Whitehall is able to respond to any emergency better by guaranteeing supply to essential users. Ministers also want the task force to look at redistributing petrol supplies into local depots, ending the concentration of the entire reserves in a small number of refineries. The companies are also to be asked to look at bringing tanker drivers back into direct employment. At present many are sub-contracted, or self-employed. Mr Straw said he had received detailed reports from the task force about the level of intimidation received by the truck drivers. \"What is incontrovertible is the truck drivers did feel intimidated and that the oil companies themselves logged a series of incidents of intimidation.\" Downing Street admitted that it will not seek to impose its new laws before the 60-day deadline imposed by the hauliers for a cut in fuel duty. Ministers have been told the overspill session is already so full it could not contemplate introducing emergency legislation this autumn. Some of the leading figures in last week's ad hoc protest are expected to meet with the Road Haulage Association on Thursday to discuss tactics. Roger King, chief executive of the RHA, warned the government was very foolish to signal plans for emergency powers. It was setting a deadline to road hauliers by which they would have to take further action. The Liberal Democrats' leader Charles Kennedy accused the government of a lack of candour during the crisis which had undermined public confidence and challenged it to create a new fuel policy which is both fair and \"upfront\" about its environmental goals. In an emergency statement at the start of the Liberal Democrats' annual conference he urged ministers to freeze fuel taxes in real terms for five years; to use the VAT windfall gained through higher world prices to improve public transport; to ensure that the oil companies \"recognise their social responsibilities both in respect of pricing and security of supply\" or face punitive tax penalties; and to provide special help for car-dependent rural areas though tax breaks on petrol stations or better community transport. Mr Kennedy told delegates in Bournemouth that the mutual consent necessary to the workings of a \"fundamentally decent country\" like Britain's had come close to breaking down last week. Oil companies said that petrol was being delivered to almost all of their stations but panic buying had forced several to close again. An estimated 12 Jet stations had been forced to close a spokesman said. \"Everyone's running very hard to catch up and queues have certainly calmed down. Buying patterns are now edgy to normal.\" BP said it had opened 90% of its 1,500 stations but anticipated that several would be forced to shut again because deliveries were not meeting demand. However, a spokeswoman said that stations are now quieter than at the weekend.It estimated that stations would return to normal within two weeks. Shell expects to have all its 1,044 stations open today. Stationsreported \"extensive queuing\" despite 230 more trucks delivering fuel yesterday than is usual for a Monday, a spokesman said. Two thirds of Esso stations - the company with the most garages - are open.

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrats voted overwhelmingly for a change in the law to recognise gay partnerships yesterday - but sought to quench middle England fears by denying that they were advocating gay marriages. With a clear eye on wooing disillusioned Tory voters, Susan Kramer, the Liberal Democrats' unsuccessful London mayoral candidate, told delegates at the party's conference in Bournemouth: \"I do stress this is not a proposal for gay marriage. That is another debate.\" What the party was proposing was a \"civil partnership\" as applicable to heterosexual couples who chose to live together but not marry, as to gay and lesbian couples. Ms Kramer said the proposal would allow any two unrelated people over 16 in England and Wales the legal benefits afforded to married people in areas such as pensions, inheritance, tax and social security. She had met with initial opposition, but had cited the example of the gay partner of one of the Soho nailbomber's victims, who received no compensation , unlike the husband of another victim. People who \"call themselves middle England\" and who would not normally be advocates of gay rights had told her it was not fair. Other delegates sought to repair the potential damage to their courtship of the Tory vote - which saw them win the Romsey byelection in May - by headlines on \"gay marriages\". Baroness Sarah Ludford, MEP for London and head of the Liberal Democrat group in the European parliament, said it was right the \"landmark motion\" should not refer to gay marriages since it was important to recognise the \"genuine sensitivities\" of those who felt marriage was an institution which must have a \"reserved status\". Dr Evan Harris, MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, insisted the move was not about forcing, or even asking, Christians to marry somebody of the same sex. \"We are just asking them to allow other people the sort of equality and freedom that they would expect for themselves,\" he said. The motion - which was carried almost unanimously - calls for ministers to consult on a scheme for civil partnerships and makes the Liberal Democrats the first mainstream British party to advocate such a policy. William Hague emphatically rejected the idea of gay marriages last month after the Tory vice-chairman, Steven Norris, backed the deal. Labour has \"no firm proposals on this issue\", a spokesman said last night. But, while it may have appeared radical, one delegate, Sue Vincent from Reigate, condemned the motion for not going far enough. \"It entrenches discrimination against gay couples by not offering them the option of civil marriage. \"Heterosexuals have three options: marriage, cohabitation or civil partnership. Lesbian and gay couples will only have two options.\" But the vote was welcomed by the gay pressure group Stonewall, which said it hoped other parties would take note. Spokesman Sebastian Sands said he was \"very pleased\" the party had shied away from the phrase \"gay marriage\". \"We don't think the word marriage is helpful. It has connotations that are not appropriate. \"It's not the religious aspect that we think is important, it's the practical aspects - inheritance, pensions, succession of tenancy, and the credibility that relationships are given.\"",

Formally, the stewards' demand for a ballot has to be approved by the unions' leadership but Mr Simpson said a ballot was inevitable \"unless the company changes its position, and there's no indication that they will\". He added: \"If the stewards' unanimous recommendation is a reflection of the mood at the plant I'm sure we'll get a positive response.\" The world's second largest car maker wants to end production of the Fiesta at Dagenham in early 2002 and build a new Fiesta in Cologne, Germany. The unofficial walk-outs came amid suspicions that Ford wants to close the line sooner and had begun trying to shift staff to the engine plant. Ford said it had no plans to change the timetable. The group has tried to sugar the pill of closing the assembly line at its biggest British plant after 80 years by investing $600m in its engine plant and creating 500 jobs. Ford UK lost \u00a3119m before tax last year and its Dagenham plans are seen as a test of its determination to tackle chronic over-capacity in the European car industry. Sir Ken Jackson, AEEU leader and protagonist of no-strike agreements, has failed to persuade Ford executives to rescind their plans by switching production of Volvos from Belgium to Dagenham and Mr Simpson said the company's decision was \"unnecessary, unjustified and totally outside our written agreements [of 1997] with Ford to build a new Fiesta at Dagenham.\"",

      "bodyText": "Bob Geldof was yesterday awarded temporary care of the orphaned daughter of his former wife, Paula Yates, as the investigation into the television presenter's death continued. Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence, four, was made a ward of court at a high court hearing following an application by Geldof, and was last night staying with her three half-sisters. Yates, 40, was found dead in bed at her London home on Sunday morning. Yesterday a postmortem was unable to determine how she died, though friends dismiss suicide, believing she may have overdosed. Further toxicology and blood tests will be carried out to pinpoint what role, if any, drugs or alcohol played in her death. At the high court hearing Mrs Justice Hogg appointed the official solicitor to represent the interests of Tiger Lily, whose father, the Australian rock star Michael Hutchence, committed suicide in November 1997. Geldof and Yates had three daughters from their marriage, which ended in divorce after she left the former Boomtown Rats' frontman for Hutchence. A spokesman for the official solicitor said: \"Sir Bob Geldof has been awarded interim care of the child [Tiger Lily], until such time as further proceedings direct otherwise.\" If Geldof or anyone else applied for the right to bring her up, the official solicitor would investigate who would be best suited to care for her. The fact that courts are reluctant to move young children from their current carers and to split siblings will strengthen Geldof's hand if he applies to look after Tiger Lily permanently. Police confirmed that scientists were examining substances taken from the mews home in west London where Yates and Tiger Lily had lived for the past year. Scotland Yard refused to comment on reports that pills, vodka bottles and heroin were found in the house. The alarm was raised after a friend, Josephine Fairley, rang Yates on Sunday morning. It is believed Tiger Lily picked up the phone, prompt ing Ms Fairley to go round to the house. When she arrived, she found the front door had been opened, it is believed by the child. Police said Tiger Lily had been in the house on Saturday evening, but refused to say whether they would talk to her to see if she could shed any light on her mother's last hours. Hutchence's father, Kell, said he believed Tiger Lily was in \"good hands\" with Geldof. Speaking from his home in Australia, Mr Hutchence, 67, said: \"My heart goes out to Bob Geldof and to my little granddaughter, Tiger Lily, who I feel for so much at this tragic hour, but certainly we will see how things proceed and I will be guided by many factors in this matter.\" Mr Hutchence had tried to gain custody of Tiger Lily after newspaper reports that Yates was dating a one-time heroin addict, but yesterday he said: \"I only ever tried to get a temporary custody, if you can call it custody, which would just have been looking after Tiger when her mother was not well. \"I know that Paula had her ways and often we didn't agree, but God bless her, I never really thought it would come to this.

But he was educated in Warsaw, where his father was a functionary in the city courts, attending the Jan Zamoyski lyc\u00e9e and then Warsaw University, where he read law. On graduating in 1929, he took a job in the Polish ministry of agriculture, moving, in 1935, to trade and industry. He continued his intellectual interests, taking a university history course in his spare time.</p> <p>Giedroyc had tried his hand at publishing a student magazine, and in 1930, while still a civil servant, launched a periodical called The Rebellion Of Youth, which in 1936 changed its name to Polityka. It was a left-of-centre, anti-communist publication, which stirred up controversy with pieces by extremists of various hues, and showing an unfashionable interest in events in countries such as Lithuania and the Ukraine.</p> <p>When the Germans invaded Poland in September 1939, Giedroyc escaped to Romania, where he offered his services as private secretary to the Polish ambassador, and then as agent for Polish affairs at the British embassy. In March 1941, he left Bucharest for the Middle East, where he joined the Polish army, serving with the Highland Rifle Brigade in Libya and fighting at Tobruk.</p> <p>When his unit moved to Palestine, Giedroyc was given the job of publishing the Polish 2nd Corps journal. After a brief stint in the ministry of information of the Polish government in London, he returned to Rome, where, at the beginning of 1946, he embarked on a course that was to turn him into a living institution.</p> <p>Unlike many of his colleagues, who believed that tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States would lead to another war and liberate eastern Europe, Giedroyc was convinced that a long period of exile lay ahead. In the belief that Polish emigr\u00e9s would need literary and ideological sustenance, he opened a publishing house, which, in its first year, produced more than 30 books, mostly classics. In June 1947, he also launched a periodical, Kultura, which became the most important Polish publication of its kind - and remained so until his death.</p> <p>Later that year, Giedroyc moved the whole enterprise to Maisons-Laffitte, near Paris, where an aristocratic wellwisher had helped him acquire a large, and once handsome, suburban villa. In this improbable setting, Giedroyc got down to work in earnest on Kultura, a thick monthly packed with essays, narrative and polemic. He was assisted by Zygmunt Hertz and his wife, Zofia - he a sensible Sancho Panza to the quixotic Giedroyc, she the tireless copy editor and cook - and supported by the bohemian aristocratic painter, Jozef Czapski. Early editorial meetings tended to be held in the kitchen, the only warm room in the house, but the literary results were astonishing.</p> <p>Kultura provided a forum for the many Polish writers whom the war, or subsequent political events, had left stranded around the world, cut off from their readership and their raison d'etre. It thus gave back a voice to the likes of Witold Gombrowicz, Czeslaw Milosz and Gustaw Herling-Grudzinski. Giedroyc also kept in touch with writers still in Poland, printing works they could not get past the communist censors. Maisons-Laffitte soon became an international nerve-centre through which Polish literary life pulsated.</p> <p>Given Giedroyc's long-standing interest in areas east of Poland, and his sense of solidarity with the peoples of other countries under Soviet domination, it was not long before he began publishing the works of Russian and other east European writers, and his imprint began to sneak its way into the Soviet Union.</p> <p>In 1953, Giedroyc began publishing books again, producing some 500 titles over the next four decades; these tended to be new works by living authors, including Siniavsky and Solzhenitsyn, as well as major Polish writers. In 1962, he launched the twice-yearly Historical Notebooks, devoted to publishing source material and testimonial accounts of events in eastern Europe, which proved a vital source of information on what was going on.</p> <p>Life at Maisons-Laffitte was a daily struggle against bankruptcy. The quest for funds was not helped by Giedroyc's almost obsessive independence.

      "bodyText": "It has been said of the publisher Jerzy Giedroyc, who has died aged 94, that he saved Polish literature from extinction during his country's long night of communism, and even if the claim is a little exaggerated, few Poles would quibble. He was born in a town known as Minsk Litewski when it was part of Poland, and as Mensk, now that it is the capital of Belarus. But he was educated in Warsaw, where his father was a functionary in the city courts, attending the Jan Zamoyski lyc\u00e9e and then Warsaw University, where he read law. On graduating in 1929, he took a job in the Polish ministry of agriculture, moving, in 1935, to trade and industry. He continued his intellectual interests, taking a university history course in his spare time. Giedroyc had tried his hand at publishing a student magazine, and in 1930, while still a civil servant, launched a periodical called The Rebellion Of Youth, which in 1936 changed its name to Polityka. It was a left-of-centre, anti-communist publication, which stirred up controversy with pieces by extremists of various hues, and showing an unfashionable interest in events in countries such as Lithuania and the Ukraine. When the Germans invaded Poland in September 1939, Giedroyc escaped to Romania, where he offered his services as private secretary to the Polish ambassador, and then as agent for Polish affairs at the British embassy. In March 1941, he left Bucharest for the Middle East, where he joined the Polish army, serving with the Highland Rifle Brigade in Libya and fighting at Tobruk. When his unit moved to Palestine, Giedroyc was given the job of publishing the Polish 2nd Corps journal. After a brief stint in the ministry of information of the Polish government in London, he returned to Rome, where, at the beginning of 1946, he embarked on a course that was to turn him into a living institution. Unlike many of his colleagues, who believed that tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States would lead to another war and liberate eastern Europe, Giedroyc was convinced that a long period of exile lay ahead. In the belief that Polish emigr\u00e9s would need literary and ideological sustenance, he opened a publishing house, which, in its first year, produced more than 30 books, mostly classics. In June 1947, he also launched a periodical, Kultura, which became the most important Polish publication of its kind - and remained so until his death. Later that year, Giedroyc moved the whole enterprise to Maisons-Laffitte, near Paris, where an aristocratic wellwisher had helped him acquire a large, and once handsome, suburban villa. In this improbable setting, Giedroyc got down to work in earnest on Kultura, a thick monthly packed with essays, narrative and polemic. He was assisted by Zygmunt Hertz and his wife, Zofia - he a sensible Sancho Panza to the quixotic Giedroyc, she the tireless copy editor and cook - and supported by the bohemian aristocratic painter, Jozef Czapski. Early editorial meetings tended to be held in the kitchen, the only warm room in the house, but the literary results were astonishing. Kultura provided a forum for the many Polish writers whom the war, or subsequent political events, had left stranded around the world, cut off from their readership and their raison d'etre. It thus gave back a voice to the likes of Witold Gombrowicz, Czeslaw Milosz and Gustaw Herling-Grudzinski. Giedroyc also kept in touch with writers still in Poland, printing works they could not get past the communist censors. Maisons-Laffitte soon became an international nerve-centre through which Polish literary life pulsated. Given Giedroyc's long-standing interest in areas east of Poland, and his sense of solidarity with the peoples of other countries under Soviet domination, it was not long before he began publishing the works of Russian and other east European writers, and his imprint began to sneak its way into the Soviet Union. In 1953, Giedroyc began publishing books again, producing some 500 titles over the next four decades; these tended to be new works by living authors, including Siniavsky and Solzhenitsyn, as well as major Polish writers. In 1962, he launched the twice-yearly Historical Notebooks, devoted to publishing source material and testimonial accounts of events in eastern Europe, which proved a vital source of information on what was going on. Life at Maisons-Laffitte was a daily struggle against bankruptcy. The quest for funds was not helped by Giedroyc's almost obsessive independence. He would not espouse any single literary set, and frequently annoyed his contributors by publishing material by writers of opposing literary cliques. Nor would he toe any political line, and his contacts with writers living in communist Poland annoyed the London government in exile, which boycotted everything from behind the Iron Curtain. But the quality of his publications spoke for him, as did his dedication to the cause, and a steady trickle of donations, most of them pathetically small sums eked out of desultory pensions, helped to keep the enterprise afloat. This, in itself, was an extraordinary achievement; many other emigr\u00e9 publishing ventures collapsed in heaps of heavily-accented newsprint. Loathed and denounced by the Polish and Soviet governments, which even leaned on the French authorities to close down his venture, Giedroyc was idolised by the Polish intelligentsia, and by many Russians, Byelorussians, Ukrainians and Lithuanians. He was a member of the editorial committee of the Russian dissident publication Kontinent, and an adviser to other groups, who treasured his experience and judgment. Giedroyc was, in many ways, an unlikely hero in Polish terms, and, for all the cloak-and-dagger stuff involved in spiriting manuscripts, microfilms and books in and out of the Soviet bloc, there was nothing flamboyant about this poised, self-possessed chain-smoker.

He surprised all but his closest friends when, following the victory of 1989, he refused to return to Poland and declined all official honours. He knew he needed no distinction.

As a result, it can undermine the message that all South Africans must take precautions to avoid infection.\"</p> <p>When Mr Mbeki spoke immediately afterwards, he made only a fleeting reference to Aids as a cause of people being unable to work.</p> <p>The unions' criticism comes on the heels of a confidential memorandum written by the ANC's own health committee and addressed to Mr Mbeki and his health minister, saying HIV causes Aids and that they must publicly acknowledge this.

      "bodyText": "The South African government's most powerful ally - the country's trade union confederation Cosatu - has accused President Thabo Mbeki of causing confusion and costing lives by questioning the link between HIV and Aids. Mr Mbeki was forced to listen impassively yesterday while trade unionists at the annual meeting of the Congress of South African Trade Unions loudly applauded their leader, Willie Madisha, as he condemned the president on an issue that is causing as much friction between the unions and government as economic policy. \"The current public debate on the causal link between HIV and Aids is confusing,\" said Willie Madisha. \"For Cosatu, the link between HIV and Aids is irrefutable and any other approach is unscientific and unfortunately likely to confuse people. As a result, it can undermine the message that all South Africans must take precautions to avoid infection.\" When Mr Mbeki spoke immediately afterwards, he made only a fleeting reference to Aids as a cause of people being unable to work. The unions' criticism comes on the heels of a confidential memorandum written by the ANC's own health committee and addressed to Mr Mbeki and his health minister, saying HIV causes Aids and that they must publicly acknowledge this. The committee said \"we do not have the luxury of fiddling whilst the masses are dying\". Mounting anger and dissent within the ruling party, the unions, the medical profession and among large numbers of ordinary black people over Mr Mbeki's questioning of conventional scientific thought has forced the government on to the defensive. It has moved to quell criticism with a series of adverts \"clarifying\" the president's views. They say that Mr Mbeki has never denied a link between HIV and Aids but that he does not attribute immune deficiency exclusively to the virus, that poverty is also a primary factor, and that drugs are not the only response. The president's critics accuse him of playing with words and undermining years of Aids education. His government has used these \"doubts\" to justify withholding drugs from HIV positive people, including pregnant women, they say, adding that scientists have long recognised that ill-nourished poor people with weak immune systems may succumb to HIV more swiftly but that has little to do with the cause of Aids.

The captain and three senior crew members of the 100,000 tonne Matco Clyde oil tanker had been drinking for almost five hours in a pub in Macduff, Aberdeenshire, when they attempted to return to their ship. The tribunal, being held in Eastleigh magistrates court, Hampshire, heard that the group, led by Captain Clive Mottram, 54, from Southampton, had arrived in the Macduff Arms at noon on March 23. Mottram had anchored 13 miles off the coast of the fishing town and, along with chief engineer John Blamires, from Buxton, Derbyshire, and two other senior crew members, had decided to take a boat into Macduff for an afternoon's drinking session. The group drank heavily until, shortly before 5pm, they received a call from the tanker urging them to return because of the worsening weather. Belinda Bucknell QC, representing the maritime and coastguard agency, told the tribunal that Mottram had consumed between six and seven pints and all four crew members were drunk. Despite this, they left Macduff for the tanker while a storm brewed. \"As they attempted to steer their craft from the harbour back to the Matco Clyde, they collided with the east harbour wall, scraping 50ft along the breakwater,\" Mrs Bucknell said. While concerned local people looked on, Mrs Bucknell said, the crew smashed their single-engine rig into the wall once more. The bystanders urged the crew to return to the harbour, but they responded with \"an obscene gesture\". Fearing for the crew's safety, the Macduff harbourmasters alerted coastguards. The crew had a 13 mile journey back to the tanker, but within six miles their boat ran out of petrol and was swamped. At around 7pm, a Royal Navy helicopter managed to locate the stricken boat by the lights on the crew's lifejackets. The helicopter sent down a winch man to airlift the four to safety, but, Mrs Bucknell said, he arrived to find one of the crew slumped drunkenly over the wheel. The tribunal heard that the semi-conscious crewman was believed to have been the captain - and another crew member was similarly inebriated. As the crew were thought to be drunk, the helicopter pilots refused to return them to the Matco Clyde and, instead, took them to their base at Lossiemouth. They were questioned by police and Mottram and Blamires were charged with serious negligence and misconduct under the Merchant Shipping Act. Mottram's solicitor, Stephen Kilelea, said that as a result of the incident his client had been dismissed by Mobil, the tanker owners, after more than 25 years' service. But Mr Kilelea said his client had not been drunk and had not consumed the quantities of alcohol suggested by the MCA. He said Mottram had shown symptoms of alcohol abuse, but was actually suffering from a mix of hypothermia and low blood sugar.

But the grand forum of the nation - parliament - was extinguished in the late crisis from the debate. Parliament was on two and a half months' holiday. And even if it had not been, it might not have made very much difference. Events like last week's make the great buildings on Parliament Square seem like a kind of echoing museum. Politics, the Liberal treasury spokesman Matthew Taylor told the party assembly yesterday, was much scarier, more energetic, in your face, fast, awkward, difficult, hi-tech: frightening and seductive. And instantly responsive, in a way the official system is not. It will have to learn to live with them. So the hour and a half the Liberal Democrats spent yesterday discussing our institutions was no mere backwater issue. Disaffection has always been an engine of political and constitutional change. Maybe it could be again.</p> <p>The Lib Dems did a lot, in terms of commitments, to change the face of Britain in their 90 minutes.

      "bodyText": "In the Rose and Crown and the Safeway, on the high street corner and the village green, and especially in the petrol queue people talked of little else. But the grand forum of the nation - parliament - was extinguished in the late crisis from the debate. Parliament was on two and a half months' holiday. And even if it had not been, it might not have made very much difference. Events like last week's make the great buildings on Parliament Square seem like a kind of echoing museum. Politics, the Liberal treasury spokesman Matthew Taylor told the party assembly yesterday, was much scarier, more energetic, in your face, fast, awkward, difficult, hi-tech: frightening and seductive. And instantly responsive, in a way the official system is not. It will have to learn to live with them. So the hour and a half the Liberal Democrats spent yesterday discussing our institutions was no mere backwater issue. Disaffection has always been an engine of political and constitutional change. Maybe it could be again. The Lib Dems did a lot, in terms of commitments, to change the face of Britain in their 90 minutes. They replaced the Lords with an elected senate, kicking the bishops out. They gave us a real Freedom of Information Bill, strengthened the select committee system, cut the number of ministers, and pushed devolution further. Then gleefully grasping a proffered amendment, they revoked the Act of Settlement to allow the monarch to belong to any religion (or none) and barred the head of state from holding any high position in any particular church, thus disestablishing the Church of England.

There was no way Granada was going to go back to being the hotch-potch of businesses it was ten years ago.\"",

In most cases the corporations involved are not keen to publicise their practices, and nor are the victims, anxious to avoid further stigmatisation.

      "bodyText": "The US equal employment opportunities commissioner, Paul Miller, has called for tougher safeguards for workers against genetic discrimination after it emerged that hundreds of people have already lost their jobs or insurance protection as a direct result of advances in genetic screening. \"Just as it is illegal to refuse to hire an individual because of their race or gender, it should be illegal to make job decisions based solely upon genetic information without considering that person's ability to do the work,\" Mr Miller wrote in an article in the University of Maryland's Journal of Health Care Law &amp; Policy. \"It is simply bad science for an employer to use the presence of a predictive genetic trait or marker to make workplace decisions, because those traits cannot predict how well that person will succeed in the workplace.\" Civil rights activists are growing concerned that if such Orwellian practices develop at the same pace as the race to decipher the human blueprint they could create a \"genetic underclass\" considered unemployable because of the chemical codes they carry inside them. 'Flaws' cost jobs In a recent survey carried out by the Shriver centre for public health in Massachusetts, doctors and genetic testing centres reported 582 cases of people who were turned down for jobs or health insurance because of \"flaws\" discovered in their genes. Another watchdog organisation, the Council for Responsible Genetics (CRG), says it has documented more than 200 cases of genetic discrimination by employers. Researchers believe these figures are the tip of an iceberg. In most cases the corporations involved are not keen to publicise their practices, and nor are the victims, anxious to avoid further stigmatisation. In the cases cited by the genetics council the victims are not referred to by their full names. They include Kim, a social worker, who mentioned at a staff workshop that her mother had died of Huntington's disease, giving her a 50% chance of developing the potentially fatal genetic condition. A week later she was dismissed. In another case a 40-year-old woman with an exemplary employment record agreed to take part in a genetic research survey and tested positive for BRAC1, a gene linked to some breast and ovarian cancers. Despite having preventive surgery she lost her health insurance and then her job. Mr Miller is calling for new federal legislation to close the legal loopholes that allow employers and insurance companies to gain access to genetic information on prospective employees and use that information in hiring and firing. An attempt to get Congress to pass an anti-discrimination law - led by the Democratic leader in the Senate, Tom Daschle - has been blocked by the opposition of the insurance industry and the corporate lobby in Washington. Watching the bill being shelved until next year at the earliest, the senator warned: \"We simply cannot afford to take one step forward in science while taking two steps backwards in civil rights.\" The scientists leading the race to decode the human genome - like the physicists before them who first split the atom - also know the dangers that are inherent in their mission. As the first draft of the human genome map was unveiled to a great fanfare in June one of its principal authors, Francis Collins, director of National Human Genome Research Institute, said: \"Already, with but a handful of genetic tests in common use, people have lost their jobs, lost their health insurance and lost their economic well-being due to the unfair and inappropriate use of genetic information.\" Records unprotected Recent research has found that the fear of future discrimination can be as damaging as discrimination itself, as people forgo screening for potentially treatable conditions for fear the information will be used against them in the future. A study by Georgetown University in Washington found that fear of discrimination has led one in 10 people at risk deciding against testing for genetic traits linked to cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, colon cancer and other conditions with a hereditary link. The US department of labour has found that many women are avoiding breast cancer screening because they believe a positive finding would go on their medical records and become available to employers or insurers. Their fears are justified in an unregulated market, where medical data are often treated as a tradable commodity, bought and sold by medical centres and insurance companies.

The danger was lest the engineer who fired the petard should be blown up [into the air = hoist, OED] by the explosion.\" Petard, probably from the French, p\u00e9ter, break wind.

The system is designed to stop a train if it passes a signal at red.</p> <p>Ian Burnett QC, counsel to the inquiry into railway safety, said the latest reports showed that \"the accelerated timetable agreed at the end of last year is not being met\".</p> <p>He said: \"Whether the slippage is yet sufficient to compromise the accelerated timetable is not clear.\"</p> <p>Mr Burnett also told yesterday's opening session of the inquiry that a further 100 passengers would be killed in the next 24 years due to the same errors which triggered the Paddington and Southall crashes in west London.</p> <p>Railtrack agreed later that the \u00a3400m installation programme, to which it has committed \u00a3370m, had fallen behind.

      "bodyText": "Railtrack's installation of a new train safety system, ordered by John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, after the Paddington rail disaster last October, is already falling behind schedule, a public inquiry was told yesterday. More than 700 key signals controlling track junctions should have been fitted with the train warning protection system (TPWS), but only 550 have been completed. The system is designed to stop a train if it passes a signal at red. Ian Burnett QC, counsel to the inquiry into railway safety, said the latest reports showed that \"the accelerated timetable agreed at the end of last year is not being met\". He said: \"Whether the slippage is yet sufficient to compromise the accelerated timetable is not clear.\" Mr Burnett also told yesterday's opening session of the inquiry that a further 100 passengers would be killed in the next 24 years due to the same errors which triggered the Paddington and Southall crashes in west London. Railtrack agreed later that the \u00a3400m installation programme, to which it has committed \u00a3370m, had fallen behind. But it would soon begin to make up the difference and fit 11,000 signals by the end of 2002. Critics of Railtrack say that its programme is far too ambitious and that it is beginning to admit privately that it cannot keep to this schedule. The fitting may take at least a further three years. Health and safety executive officials say they are also concerned at Railtrack's slow progress, although they are prepared to wait and see if the fitting of TPWS can be stepped up. The HSE would not hesitate to use statutory powers to enforce the timetable. The system has been strongly criticised as a cheap alternative, and not very effective for trains travelling at more than 70mph. Before the inquiry began yesterday, survivors and relatives from both the Paddington and Southall train crashes, in which a total of 38 people died, called for TPWS to be scrapped and replaced with the more efficient, but much more expensive Automatic Train Protection. Implementation of ATP, which would stop any train at any speed if it passed through a signal at danger, was abandoned by the last government because it would have cost \u00a3700m. At today's prices, it would cost almost \u00a32bn, and both the government and the rail industry are hesitant about it. Louise Christian of the Southall and Ladbroke Grove solicitors' group, which represents a large proportion of those killed in both rail crashes, said: \"We will not put up with a second-rate system. Nobody is going to understand when there is another crash and it is learned that ATP was not fitted.\" Comparing ATP with TPWS was like comparing a \"computer with a manual typewriter. ATP is in operation throughout Europe. Why should we be saddled with a system which is not failsafe?\" The rail unions want the government to back the introduction of ATP but were overruled by Mr Prescott at the Labour national forum and may be banned from speaking on the issue at next week's party conference. Yesterday's joint inquiry is being chaired by Lord Cullen and Professor John Uff, in charge respectively of the two previous public inquiries into Paddington and Southall. A report will be published early next year.",

Bottom line is, 'e should not stand aht. They won't 'esitate to kick 'is 'ead in.\" The best way to stop your head being kicked in is to shave your hair off. That done, Alex looked like one of those small, bald aliens who used to turn up in Star Trek wearing nighties. He knew how Caesar conquered Gaul and how to whack a cricket ball but not how to chuck out a drunk. \"I've done a lot of rowing.\" \"That'll be 'andy\" said Tony drily. \"You can 'it 'em with the oars.\" A kick-boxing bout with Tony's girlfriend, Bernice, did not impress the bookies. \"'E's lucky to 'ave 'is testicles.\" At RADA, Alex was coached in talking common. \"The word fuck is desperately important to all Londoners. Fuck you, fuck me, fuck off! Lengthen the vowel. Let the breath be the impetus. Farkin' 'ell! Don't smile! Mean it.\" In grammar: \"I was, you was, she was, they was.\" And deportment: \"Think monkey.\" After a month's training, Alex was one of several bouncers at the Hippodrome on the night of the England v Germany match and the head of security failed to spot the imposter (\"Nah! Honestly?\") Tony was much moved. \"It's like seeing your kid walk and talk for the first time, innit? Very proud. Very proud. But he should be proud of himself too.\" The kid, waving goodbye at Paddington, said \"I'm not going to cry, because I'm a hard doorman. Five weeks ago I'd have cried because I made good mates here. Very, very, very good mates indeed. I feel very, very deeply moved and privileged to have come across such kind and generous people. Generous with their hospitality and their acceptance of me. I've been completely overwhelmed by it and I'm going to keep in contact with absolutely everybody.\" You liked the whole farking lot of them. The Cops (BBC 2) is brilliant drama pretending to be documentary. The camerawork looks epileptic, the dialogue sounds improvised, the acting is extraordinarily ordinary. It makes you work. I follow it like an eager dog, nose turning this way and that, not catching every word. But quivering.",

      "body": "<p>For those too young to remember, \"protest and survive\" was a slogan that peace campaigners adopted in the 1980s, after the Thatcher government published an absurd pamphlet entitled Protect and Survive advising what to do in a nuclear attack. It was the historian and activist EP Thompson who coined the pun, I seem to remember, for a book of political essays. Protest and Survive is also the title of a new show at London's Whitechapel Gallery about history and its use; the curators say they want to recover \"the political voice that is forever glossed over\" in art from the 1960s to today. </p> <p>Thompson was a romantic British socialist, a student of both Marx and William Morris, who argued in books such as The Making of the English Working Class that popular actions in the past, from bread riots to the poetry of William Blake, can be understood as expressions of a common culture of protest. Thompson was trying to find a common thread in the disparate strands of radicalism; in his day this meant finding a link between CND and the working class. In our day it means finding coherence in the diverse protest movements against the global economy. And in this exhibition it means trying to tie together threads of disparate fury in the art of the past 30 years. </p> <p>So what are they protesting against? What have you got? There's everything here: Gustav Metzger attacking the global economy with his proposal for a monument to the environment composed of rank upon rank of cars, and cartoonist Robert Thompson's flat-capped northerner telling his son as they contemplate smoking factories, \"One day son, all this will be art galleries.\" Then there's 1970s conceptual artist Cosi Fanni Tutti hiring herself out as a model and stripshow dancer in protest against... something, and the Conspiracy Paintings of David MacDermott and Peter MacGough, attacking abstract expressionism as a CIA front and fingering Aids as \"a manipulation of information for purposes of genocide and control, using street drugs and pharmaceuticals to murder and steal property\". </p> <p>This is a raggle-taggle collection of relics, featuring an ill-assorted army of 1970s hippies and skinheads. Whatever it was that made the Austrian artist Valie Export lie motionless in the street in 1972, I'm against it. I'll sign a petition against it. Just don't make me look at any more art relics. There's right-wing protest too, with Gilbert and George's picture of a bomber-jacketed Cocky Patriot (1980) standing between two union flags sewn on the buttocks of a pair of jeans. The homoeroticism complicates the far-right politics - but not enough for my liking. Gilbert and George have become so revered as godfathers of the new British art that young artists and curators now think they can see through their explicit hard right affinities to what they imagine is a core of queer radicalism. But G+G are flamboyantly, unrepentantly right-wing. At a recent public appearance at Tate Modern they confirmed that not only do they still love Margaret Thatcher, \"we even like William Hague\". </p> <p>What is missing from most of this art is analysis. Protest - what does that mean? It can be utterly incoherent and reactionary. \"No Derv for Paediatrician Pervs\", \"We Want Something or Other and We Want it Now!\" as the placards said in Steve Bell's cartoon on the fuel protest in last Thursday's Guardian. Karl Marx pointed out a long time ago that radical romanticism is a waste of time: if you want to change the world, you must first understand it. </p> <p>The best art here attempts to do that. Richard Hamilton's Treatment Room (1984) is an NHS operating theatre with creepy white and military green walls. There's a sink for the professionals to wash their hands after administering treatment. They work at a glass-windowed booth, flicking switches and watching the dials on an electronic control panel. The patient lies on a thin mattress and looks up at a screen with images of Margaret Thatcher speaking. </p> <p>This is a great political work of art because it is witty and does more than protest. Hamilton is an ironist with an acute feeling for history. He loves technology, and even in this study in terror there's a perverse enjoyment. As in his famous collage, Just What Is It That Makes Today's Homes So Different, So Appealing? (1956) - made as a poster for the exhibition This Is Tomorrow at this same gallery almost half a century ago - Hamilton uses an interior as an image of modern life. It is a room that exerts power over anyone who enters it. We are helpless before this historical juggernaut. In the end, we all submit to the treatment. </p> <p>However, while Treatment Room lingers in the mind, much of the art here doesn't. The style of the exhibition is deliberately anti-aesthetic. In a reaction against glitzy contemporary art shows, this one sets out to make you think. So you have to read a lot of words. The conceptual artist Steven Willats's contributions - early 1980s text and archive pieces in which witnesses describe post-punk subcultures - are mostly words. Only when you get to the end of his texts do you realise they weren't worth reading. Jo Spence's remodellings of photo history and medical history were also done largely in words. This is in the tradition of conceptual art, which was born in the late 1960s out of a suspicion of the image: artists who wanted to attack capitalism believed words were more honest than pictures. They thought they were continuing the Dadaist anti-art tradition, but the Dadaists discovered that images could be a form of political power: some of the most powerful images of the 20th century are German Dadaist John Heartfield's anti-Nazi photomontages. I wanted something like that here, something to bite into memory. </p> <p>Protest and Survive identifies politics in contemporary art with a suspicion of the aesthetic. This reflects the mood of young art in London. Artists and curators emerging in the wake of the Hirst generation are wary of making shiny, visually striking things to go in galleries. They see themselves as infinitely more serious. Politics is suddenly a word to conjure with. Artists want to be conceptual Marxists, like the 1970s group Art&amp;Language. </p> <p>But art is a symbolic practice. Artists create images, and images have political meanings - ones the artist might not predict. The most potent political works of the past few decades - like the great political art of the past from Goya to Guernica - deploy devastating images. This show could have included Andy Warhol's electric chairs, Ed Keinholz's Portable War Memorial, Chris Burden's Shoot, Joseph Beuys' Tramstop. </p> <p>Instead we get art whose sense of its own impotence cannot be concealed. Giorgio Sadotti's installation One...Two... (1993), consisting of a set of drums, guitars and amplifiers apparently just left by a band rehearsing in a garage, is melancholic. The catalogue links it to anarcho-skinhead writer Stewart Home's definition of revolution as \"one, two, three, four\" and it seems intended as an image of action. But it doesn't feel like that: it feels feeble, leftover, marginal. On the wall nearby is a painting by art collective Bank of a dismal factory landscape modelled on LS Lowry. \"Would you be worried if one of these northerners ceased to exist?\" asks a poster with the same Lowry stick figures. This is a pretty good joke. But it smacks of what political activists used to call defeatism. </p> <p>I think we are approaching the core of the exhibition's oddness. One of the curators is Matthew Higgs, founder at the age of 14 of a fanzine for Joy Division, a band not noted for their revolutionary optimism. The other is Paul Noble, inventor of Nobson Newtown, a scary imaginary town whose Nobslums and Nobjobclub he draws with meticulous despair. What a pair of miseries. This exhibition claims to revive the art of protest, but it is really an act of mourning. The problem with all the disjointed protests it brings together is that you never feel they are tangible or present. They happened; we pore over the relics. </p> <p>The curators should have read their EP Thompson. For Thompson there is no future without art. Culture is not the enemy; it is what we need to give us common purpose and strength. Symbols, narratives and argument are the resources Thompson believed were necessary if we were to protest and survive. This exhibition distrusts symbols, repudiates narrative. It contrasts unfavourably with the exhibition that beat all these new political art shows to it and did it better - Unconvention, curated by the artist Jeremy Deller last year at Cardiff's Centre for the Visual Arts (which, incidentally, has just been closed down by Cardiff's city council). </p> <p>Unconvention had an infectious enthusiasm to it, and a belief in art, culture and the human spirit, whether expressed in pop music, Jackson Pollock (both were in the show), or activism. It made you hopeful. Deller's contribution to Protest and Survive is funny and poignant, too: he shows a series of snapshots of Bozo the Clown, a middle-aged man in full clown makeup, wandering round the futuristic exhibits at Hanover's Expo 2000. The piece is called Has the World Changed, or Have I Changed? </p> <p>However, the real star of Protest and Survive is the Turner-shortlisted photographer Wolfgang Tillmans, who saves the show which he publicised as guest editor of the Big Issue. At the far end of the highest gallery at the Whitechapel he is given a long wall to create one of his free, collagistic installations of his own pictures mixed up with news headlines, magazine pictures and other stuff. Tillmans is anything but a conceptual artist. He's relaxed with making images, seeming to chance on them without thinking. And yet his montage of momentary glimpses of things, from rock festival crowds to an operating theatre to young soldiers, adds up to an image of living today, trying to protest and survive. It's poetic rather than rational, and all the better for it. At the centre of Tillmans's installation is a huge blown-up colour image of a sandcastle whose foundations are being lapped by the sea. A beautiful green wave flows towards the already tottering turrets. It makes you think of walls crashing down. </p> <p>\u0095 Protest and Survive is at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London E1 (020-7522 7878), till November 12.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I rarely watch sitcoms. I was also extremely rude about Robert Lindsay's Richard III two years ago, comparing his performance for the Royal Shakespeare Company to Ken Dodd capering before a Palladium audience.

Kitted out in naval officer's uniform for a new Hornblower series shooting at Pinewood, Lindsay explained what lured him into six episodes of My Family. </p> <p>\"It all started when Fred Barron, the man behind The Larry Sanders Show and Seinfeld, came to stay over Christmas.

Actually, it's not a bad problem to have and is perfectly soluble. Thelma Holt has approached him to play Archie Rice in Osborne's The Entertainer, a part that requires both classical discipline and vaudevillian expertise.

      "bodyText": "Yugoslavia began trying western leaders yesterday for their part in the Nato bombing of Yugoslavia last year, accusing them of crimes against humanity and violating the country's territorial sovereignty. The trial is expected to end immediately before Sunday's presidential and general elections with sentences of 15-20 years on Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, the former Nato secretary general Xavier Solana and European commander General Wesley Clarke, among others. As President Slobodan Milosevic's re-election campaign gathered pace before polling day, his anti-Nato rhetoric found an echo in the trial. A row of 14 empty chairs was set opposite the panel of judges in Belgrade's palace of justice, each seat labelled with the name of the person charged in absentia. It took three hours to read the charges accusing them of crimes against humanity, initiating an aggressive war, using illegal weapons such as cluster bombs, and violating the territorial sovereignty of Yugoslavia. The prosecutor read out the names of 503 civilians, 240 soldiers and 147 police officers whom he said were killed during the bombing. At the weekend three members of the student-based resistance movement Otpor, were jailed for 10 days for spraying graffiti on walls in the capital. Their lawyer, Biljana Kajganic, said the trial in the Belgrade police headquarters in was \"incorrect\" and she would appeal against the verdict. The latest poll shows Mr Milosevic with 27% and Mr Kostunica with 32% of the vote. But 30% of the electorate have not yet decided or say they will not vote. In a further sign of jitters, the state newspaper Politika carried a vitriolic attack on the presidential opposition chal lenger Vojislav Kostunica. One analyst in Belgrade said he believed the article, which portrays Mr Kostunica as a serial adulterer and a liar, could sway many voters. The Nato show trial was dismissed by a western diplomat as \"a pre-election stunt\". But it plays to a campaign by the Milosevic regime which has exploited the incomprehension and anger felt by many people toward Nato and the west. State newspapers and television carried long items from the trial and are expected to report vivid testimony and show gruesome pictures of the damage inflicted on civilians. One of the crimes against civilians with which the western leaders are charged is the bombing of the state television station RTS. Testimonies were read, including that of a desk editor who spoke of the smell in the building. \"I found two men who were completely bloody,\" he said. \"The smell and the smoke was pervasive. I had blood dripping from my legs.\" The evidence was accompanied by footage of burned bod ies under collapsed masonry. The public reaction to the trial will become clear in the coming days. Zanka Stojanovic, who lost her 26-year-old son Nebojsa in the RTS attack, said she blamed Nato and Mr Milosevic. \"We are accusing Nato leaders and domestic politicians as the ones who are responsible for this,\" she said. \"Our people were not good diplomats and to let such a terrible thing happen at the end of the 20th century is a shame for human kind.\" But she took no comfort from the trial: \"It is a circus theatre.

The Lady's Slipper usually lives for more than 100 years, so it takes its time about these things. </p> <p> <b> And it didn't feel the urge to \"go forth and multiply\" at any stage? </b><br> Wrong type of bees, apparently.

      "bodyText": "AKA: Cypripedium calceolus; Britain's rarest wild flower. How rare exactly? Even a French chef would be impressed. What sort of brute would want to destroy such a symbol of innocence and beauty? It seems those pesky Victorians couldn't keep their plant-collecting fingers off the pretty little flower, and it was declared extinct in 1917. But on the third day it rose again? It's not a rose, it's an orchid. Please pay attention. You know what I mean. Oh all right. In 1937, a lone Lady's Slipper was found growing in the wild at an undisclosed location in the north of England. And you're telling me that no stray rambler or rare-orchid collector has felt the urge to pick it during the intervening time? The lone Lady's Slipper has been in the guardianship of English Nature since its discovery. In the summer months, when it flowers, there has been a round-the-clock watch to protect it from thieving paws. So what has it been doing for the past 64 years? Oh, y'know, growing. The Lady's Slipper usually lives for more than 100 years, so it takes its time about these things. And it didn't feel the urge to \"go forth and multiply\" at any stage? Wrong type of bees, apparently. The troops from Kew Gardens were drafted in to do some manual pollination, and a seed was germinated in 1987 and planted in the countryside in 1989. So what's happened now? It has flowered. What? Petals and everything? Yup. And how would I recognise this lesser-spotted bloom? In his book Britain's Wild Flowers, Peter Marren described the flower thus: \"A golden clog or slipper held in the grasp of four purple banners... It looks like some archetypal jungle plant, or the sort of thing a Romantic poet might invent after a session on the opium.\" You can't miss it. Not to be confused with: The giant panda.",

Besides, it is also an elite that controls New York publishing, if perhaps a slightly less homogeneous one. The New York Times, it is true, is rigorous about assuring a lack of connection between reviewer and reviewed. And generally, America is a more think-positive place: the guilty pleasure of reading a review that annihilates an author is not one indulged so frequently there. American editors will encourage criticism to be well grounded and are less inclined to allow general character assassination than here. </p> <p>For anyone new to London's literary conversation, whether it's taking place in print or between two Chardonnay drinkers at a book launch, the obsession with writers' tiffs does seem baffling.

Under targets set by the David Blunkett, the education secretary, authorities will be expected to hand over at least 90% of their education budget to schools. But the green paper proposals, to be unveiled by the local government minister Hilary Armstrong, are expected to be received as a \"curate's egg\" by head teachers. It falls short of satisfying calls from the National Association of Head Teachers and the Secondary Heads' Association for a national funding formula for schools. Under the proposals, councils will still be able to switch money between the different elements of the education budget, or out of the budget altogether. But the green paper will hold out the option of ringfencing the money in the future if councils do not obey government guidelines. The cash each council is expected to spend on education will be calculated on the basis of a simplified formula. There will be a flat rate, per-pupil spending, and two top-up elements: deprivation, and difficulty in recruiting and retaining teachers. Ministers believe the formula will enable communities to hold councils to account if they fail to hand over the money expected. Mr Blunkett has promised that any new formula will involve a \"levelling up, not down\". It will seek to address the persistent complaints of teachers in about 40 or so council areas which receive significantly less funding per pupil than other similar areas. But the system would ensure that blame continues to be shared with local councils if schools feel pressure from books shortages, for instance. Sources familiar with negotiations in Whitehall say Mr Blunkett pressed for a more radical separation of budgets, but was opposed by by John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, and by the Treasury.

She was also convicted of common assault for attacking his wife, Heather Dickson, a former nurse aged 39, in their garden in Greater Manchester last December, calling her a \"wicked slut\".</p> <p>Passing sentence yesterday, John Corless, assistant recorder, said to Dickson: \"It's a very sad day to find you in this dock, particularly given the nature of the offences you've committed.\"</p> <p>She had admitted before magistrates in Stockport that she had struggled to come to terms with her divorce from her husband of 20 years. She became upset when he remarried in February last year.</p> <p>In December a restraining order was imposed on her for \"longstanding disgraceful behaviour\", but four days later she called at her ex-husband's home.</p> <p>When Heather Dickson reminded her of the order, Dickson pulled her to the ground, punched her in the head, kicked her, and said: \"This is my husband and my children's house, and I want to be here.\" Mrs Dickson told magistrates: \"She said I was sleeping with her husband and that I was a slut. I was in shock.\" She said that she had met her husband in 1998, \"probably four years after his separation\".</p> <p>In court, representing herself, Dickson alleged that her rival's injuries had been caused by the surgeon. She said he liked to beat women.</p> <p>Magistrates heard how Dickson returned a note to the surgeon in which he had suggested dates for her to have access to their son. It was smeared with excrement and said: \"I have wiped the dog's bottom on this missive, which is all it's good for. Do not ever dictate to me again.\"</p> <p>Dickson, who spent six years in a psychiatric unit after her marriage collapsed, cross-examined her ex-husband, dismissing the letter as a joke and inquiring whether he had lost his sense of humour. He replied: \"I don't recall much laughter in my marriage. I would accept my sense of humour is limited in this family situation.\" He told magistrates that despite the restraining order his ex-wife had called him on his mobile and launched a barrage of abuse, including a local poster campaign bearing false allegations about his private life.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The former wife of a leading surgeon was put on probation for three years yesterday after stalking him and his new wife, sending him excrement in the post and distributing malicious posters near his home. Julia Dickson, 48, of Stockport, left the crown court at Manchester yesterday after three months on remand. At an earlier hearing she was convicted of four times breaching a restraining order by contacting the surgeon, Alan Dickson, 50. She was also convicted of common assault for attacking his wife, Heather Dickson, a former nurse aged 39, in their garden in Greater Manchester last December, calling her a \"wicked slut\". Passing sentence yesterday, John Corless, assistant recorder, said to Dickson: \"It's a very sad day to find you in this dock, particularly given the nature of the offences you've committed.\" She had admitted before magistrates in Stockport that she had struggled to come to terms with her divorce from her husband of 20 years. She became upset when he remarried in February last year. In December a restraining order was imposed on her for \"longstanding disgraceful behaviour\", but four days later she called at her ex-husband's home. When Heather Dickson reminded her of the order, Dickson pulled her to the ground, punched her in the head, kicked her, and said: \"This is my husband and my children's house, and I want to be here.\" Mrs Dickson told magistrates: \"She said I was sleeping with her husband and that I was a slut. I was in shock.\" She said that she had met her husband in 1998, \"probably four years after his separation\". In court, representing herself, Dickson alleged that her rival's injuries had been caused by the surgeon. She said he liked to beat women. Magistrates heard how Dickson returned a note to the surgeon in which he had suggested dates for her to have access to their son. It was smeared with excrement and said: \"I have wiped the dog's bottom on this missive, which is all it's good for. Do not ever dictate to me again.\" Dickson, who spent six years in a psychiatric unit after her marriage collapsed, cross-examined her ex-husband, dismissing the letter as a joke and inquiring whether he had lost his sense of humour. He replied: \"I don't recall much laughter in my marriage. I would accept my sense of humour is limited in this family situation.\" He told magistrates that despite the restraining order his ex-wife had called him on his mobile and launched a barrage of abuse, including a local poster campaign bearing false allegations about his private life.",

It found a breakdown of communication between agencies responsible for the care of Daniel Joseph, a deaf 18-year-old, who inflicted 50 injuries on Carla Thompson during a prolonged attack at her home in Tulse Hill, south London, in January 1998. The inquiry, chaired by the barrister Jane Mishcon, said Joseph was as much a victim of the tragedy as Mrs Thompson and her neighbour Agnes Erume, who was left permanently injured by the attack. Joseph pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was detained indefinitely at Broadmoor top security hospital. The report identified special problems for deaf people with mental health problems who cannot be properly assessed without the presence of signing interpreters. It said the National Deaf Service (NDS) had the main responsibility for planning Joseph's care after he left its psychiatric unit in August 1997. Lack of appropriate contingency plans for his aftercare \"fell short of good clinical practice\" and the service's lack of resources made it \"impotent to go in and assess his mental state in a time of emergency\".

Joseph, who was six feet seven inches tall and described as \"extremely strong\", was obsessed with WWF fights and had dreams of becoming a wrestler. Ms Mischon said: \"I feel that WWF had quite an important part to play in this tragedy. If one considers the particular brutality of the attack, one can see similarities. Some of the extreme actions of the attack did mirror what we know are the choreographed and the not-real actions of the wrestlers. To someone like Daniel, those actions seem very, very real.\" The inquiry criticised reports in the media, including the Guardian, for suggesting the homicide was \"yet another homicide by a psychiatric patient who had been disturbed and violent for some time.\" There was \"no evidence that the homicide could have been reliably predicted, even the day before it happened.\" The teenager did not have a serious mental disorder when he discharged himself from hospital in August 1997. Mrs Thompson took him as a lodger and persuaded him to stop taking his medication and rely on the power of prayer. Joseph was being \"protected from the professionals by well-meaning but misguided friends\" who thwarted attempts by the authorities to assess his mental state. A joint statement by the health authorities and the trust responsible for the NDS said: \"We accept the panel's findings that Daniel's care after he moved to Carla Thompson's flat was deficient and that a joint agency aftercare plan, with clear identification of roles and responsibilities, was lacking. \"With the benefit of hindsight we can all see that intervention ... might have prevented the death of Carla Thompson and the severe injuries to Agnes Erume. But hindsight is not the same as prediction.\" Joseph's mother Claudette said: \"He is very, very sorry for what happened and I am sorry. It is so sad. He loved Carla. He was a very, very sick boy. Carla helped Daniel in all his needs but she stopped him taking his medication because she thought it would zombify his body.\" Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of Sane, the mental health charity, said the report confirmed evidence of a confusion of responsibilities.",

      "body": "<p>It appears that a special effort is to be made to defeat adult illiteracy, after the shock revelation that one in five adults has poor literacy. And about time too. Adult illiteracy is one of the scourges of our time. Every day teachers are faced with alarming examples like this: </p> <p>\"For potential sources of evidence: schemes of work and policies; lesson plans; Ofsted grades and feedback from observation; presentations given; use of ICT to extend pupil resources/e-mail/internet; active membership of subject associations/ liaison groups/professional association committees; qualifications obtained; command of national curriculum.\" </p> <p>A nation where people can grow to adulthood and still write meaningless drivel like this is clearly a nation in desperate need of a campaign against adult illiteracy. This particular example comes from the instructions accompanying the long form that schoolteachers had to fill in if they wished to be considered for \"crossing the threshold\" and getting paid a little more money.

      "bodyText": "It appears that a special effort is to be made to defeat adult illiteracy, after the shock revelation that one in five adults has poor literacy. And about time too. Adult illiteracy is one of the scourges of our time. Every day teachers are faced with alarming examples like this: \"For potential sources of evidence: schemes of work and policies; lesson plans; Ofsted grades and feedback from observation; presentations given; use of ICT to extend pupil resources/e-mail/internet; active membership of subject associations/ liaison groups/professional association committees; qualifications obtained; command of national curriculum.\" A nation where people can grow to adulthood and still write meaningless drivel like this is clearly a nation in desperate need of a campaign against adult illiteracy. This particular example comes from the instructions accompanying the long form that schoolteachers had to fill in if they wished to be considered for \"crossing the threshold\" and getting paid a little more money. It stood by itself in a box on the page, in bold type, as though it were screaming for help. A few paragraphs on there was another such box, and then another, each more meaningless and impenetrable than the last. Worst of all was this injunction to teachers filling in the form: \"Bullet points are preferable to extended prose.\" Bullet points, generally, are nothing more than a means of avoiding the awkward necessity to write coherent prose, and they are used by people who either have nothing to say, or do not have the skill to say it. Take, for example, this desperate but unsuccessful attempt to communicate: \"Key skills can significantly improve a student's \u0095 motivation \u0095 progression \u0095 achievement \u0095 employability.\" This comes from a leaflet put out by the government to launch its campaign for key skills, one of which, ironically, is literacy.

      "body": "<p>The Sydney 2000 Olympics are good news for Australian school kids. Their spring holidays have been made a week longer so they can enjoy the excitement free from their studies. Sport is taken seriously \"down under\" and this is no ordinary sporting event. Those children will be old men and women when an Australian city next hosts \"the Games\". It was 1948 when they were last held in Britain. </p> <p>By now the competition is in full swing - 10,200 athletes from 200 countries after 302 gold medals for events in 28 sports. But are the Olympics in good shape? </p> <p> <strong> What are the Olympic Ideals?</strong> </p> <p> The Olympics were first held in Greece in 776 BC. It was a rule that, while The Games were in progress, fighting between rival Greek cities was to stop. \"The Sacred Truce\" idea was revived by Baron Pierre de Coubertin when he created the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. He hoped that the modern Olympics would be a force for good, with sports being practised \"in friendship, solidarity and fair play.\" </p> <p> <strong> Have the Games been taken over by big business?</strong> </p> <p> The linked circles on the Olympic flag represent the five main continents in harmony. It is not only a famous symbol but also an internationally recognised \"logo\". Big companies will pay for the right to include it on their products' packaging by becoming official sponsors. They hope to share in the prestige that the Games attract and like to be linked to top sporting achievement. The worry is that the IOC is too motivated by money and that some companies such as Coca Cola and McDonalds are the wrong \"backers\" for something associated with health and fitness. </p> <p> <strong> Who else benefits from the Games?</strong> </p> <p> The other winner is Sydney. 1.3 million tourists are there for the Olympics and a further 22 million people may travel to Australia over the next four years thanks to the current publicity. </p> <p>Such benefits encourage cities to make huge efforts persuading the IOC that they should host The Games. Suspicions exist that some of the tactics they resort to are unfair. Recently, a scandal involving gift-giving by Salt Lake City in America as part of its bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics led to the resignation of 10 IOC officials. </p> <p> <strong> Is anyone missing out?</strong> </p> <p> Many of the 400,000 Aborigines (2% of Australia's population) feel very excluded. Pride in Aboriginal athletes such as 400m runner Cathy Freeman does not lessen the pain caused by ongoing discrimination. To be an Aborigine is usually a guarantee of poverty, poor health, imprisonment and early death. Up to the 1960s there was a policy of forcibly taking those Aboriginal children with lighter skins away from their parents so they could be raised as \"whites\". </p> <p> <strong> Should politics be kept out of the Olympics?</strong> </p> <p> Perhaps, but because of their high international profile, the Olympics have often been used politically. This has not always been negative. This year, the teams from North and South Korea - nations at war for the last 50 years - marched under a special unity flag. </p> <p> <strong> What about the drugs problem?</strong> </p> <p> The Olympic motto is \"Citus, Altius, Fortius\" and to be faster, higher or stronger, some athletes turn to drugs. To stop them, each IOC country tests their athletes. But ensuring all nations apply the same standards is hard - America and Britain have been accused of being too lenient. Doubts also exist about the accuracy of the tests. One of the banned drugs, Nandrolone, occurs naturally in the body and some foods. </p> <p>Athletes risk their health by taking drugs. Anabolic steroids, which promote muscle development, can cause cancer and heart attacks. </p> <p> <strong> So are the Olympics becoming meaningless?</strong> </p> <p> \"Definitely not,\" says Phillip Pope of the British Olympic Association. \"To get to the Olympics at all is a huge achievement and there are dozens of athletes who train doggedly while maintaining other careers and caring for families. Many Olympic sporting heroes never become famous.\" </p> <p> <strong> Web links:</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 The British Olympic Association website includes valuable teaching resources: <a href=\"http://www.olympics.org.uk\">www.olympics.org.uk</a><br></p> <p> \u0095 The official Olympics site has an excellent archive of news stories: <a href=\"http://www.olympics.com\">www.olympics.com</a> </p> <p>\u0095 For a discussion of the treatment of Aboriginal people in Australia, see the article \"From The Dreaming to the Dole\": <a href=\"http://www.sydney.indymedia.org\">www.sydney.indymedia.org</a> </p> <p>\u0095 First Edition is a current affairs series for schools on C4 presented this week by Jon Snow and produced in association with Guardian Education.

      "bodyText": "The Sydney 2000 Olympics are good news for Australian school kids. Their spring holidays have been made a week longer so they can enjoy the excitement free from their studies. Sport is taken seriously \"down under\" and this is no ordinary sporting event. Those children will be old men and women when an Australian city next hosts \"the Games\". It was 1948 when they were last held in Britain. By now the competition is in full swing - 10,200 athletes from 200 countries after 302 gold medals for events in 28 sports. But are the Olympics in good shape? What are the Olympic Ideals? The Olympics were first held in Greece in 776 BC. It was a rule that, while The Games were in progress, fighting between rival Greek cities was to stop. \"The Sacred Truce\" idea was revived by Baron Pierre de Coubertin when he created the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. He hoped that the modern Olympics would be a force for good, with sports being practised \"in friendship, solidarity and fair play.\" Have the Games been taken over by big business? The linked circles on the Olympic flag represent the five main continents in harmony. It is not only a famous symbol but also an internationally recognised \"logo\". Big companies will pay for the right to include it on their products' packaging by becoming official sponsors. They hope to share in the prestige that the Games attract and like to be linked to top sporting achievement. The worry is that the IOC is too motivated by money and that some companies such as Coca Cola and McDonalds are the wrong \"backers\" for something associated with health and fitness. Who else benefits from the Games? The other winner is Sydney. 1.3 million tourists are there for the Olympics and a further 22 million people may travel to Australia over the next four years thanks to the current publicity. Such benefits encourage cities to make huge efforts persuading the IOC that they should host The Games. Suspicions exist that some of the tactics they resort to are unfair. Recently, a scandal involving gift-giving by Salt Lake City in America as part of its bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics led to the resignation of 10 IOC officials. Is anyone missing out? Many of the 400,000 Aborigines (2% of Australia's population) feel very excluded. Pride in Aboriginal athletes such as 400m runner Cathy Freeman does not lessen the pain caused by ongoing discrimination. To be an Aborigine is usually a guarantee of poverty, poor health, imprisonment and early death. Up to the 1960s there was a policy of forcibly taking those Aboriginal children with lighter skins away from their parents so they could be raised as \"whites\". Should politics be kept out of the Olympics? Perhaps, but because of their high international profile, the Olympics have often been used politically. This has not always been negative. This year, the teams from North and South Korea - nations at war for the last 50 years - marched under a special unity flag. What about the drugs problem? The Olympic motto is \"Citus, Altius, Fortius\" and to be faster, higher or stronger, some athletes turn to drugs. To stop them, each IOC country tests their athletes. But ensuring all nations apply the same standards is hard - America and Britain have been accused of being too lenient. Doubts also exist about the accuracy of the tests. One of the banned drugs, Nandrolone, occurs naturally in the body and some foods. Athletes risk their health by taking drugs. Anabolic steroids, which promote muscle development, can cause cancer and heart attacks. So are the Olympics becoming meaningless? \"Definitely not,\" says Phillip Pope of the British Olympic Association. \"To get to the Olympics at all is a huge achievement and there are dozens of athletes who train doggedly while maintaining other careers and caring for families. Many Olympic sporting heroes never become famous.\" Web links: \u0095 The British Olympic Association website includes valuable teaching resources: www.olympics.org.uk \u0095 The official Olympics site has an excellent archive of news stories: www.olympics.com \u0095 For a discussion of the treatment of Aboriginal people in Australia, see the article \"From The Dreaming to the Dole\": www.sydney.indymedia.org \u0095 First Edition is a current affairs series for schools on C4 presented this week by Jon Snow and produced in association with Guardian Education.

Ministers say they must have a credible analysis of the workforce and its recruitment and retention problems before they can deploy the extra \u00a350m pay initiative to reward high-calibre teachers. The DfEE is part-paying for an exhaustive 18-page questionnaire drawn up by the sector's employers' organisation, the Association of Colleges, and its five trades unions, to go out to all colleges. Meanwhile another survey conducted for the Commission for Black Staff in Further Education has found that only around 3% of lecturing staff and just two principals in a sector approaching 450 colleges, are black. \"If you are black and seeking a career in further education, it is hard to get in - and very hard to get on,\" said a spokeswoman. Jocelyn Prudence, the AoC's director of employment policy, said: \"There is widespread concern about recruitment problems. The survey hopefully will provide urgently needed information.\" Among other topics, the questionnaire, to be returned by October 31, asks how many full- and part-time employees, and how much money each college spends on agency staff.",

With other leading members of the community, he raised money to set up a number of vocational schools where impoverished Jews could learn the trades that would help them survive. ORT - or the Organisation for the Distribution of Artisanal and Agricultural Skills among Jews - was born, and before long it became an indispensable component of Jewish life in Russia.

Yet ORT continued to provide training to Jews in the Soviet Union until Stalin's purges of 1937 led to it closing its Russian operations for the next 50 odd years. Elsewhere in Europe it carried on in an increasingly dangerous climate. Wherever Jews met with discrimination, the organisation provided them with the means to fend for themselves. Somehow it operated in Berlin right up until the 1940s and remarkably carried on running courses in ghettos and camps in Nazi-occupied territory even as the Holocaust was in full swing. </p> <p>As European Jews fled to places as far as Shanghai and Santiago, ORT followed, setting up centres where refugees could learn skills that would allow them to earn a living. By the end of the second world war the organisation had become global, shadowing the diaspora to the New World and, of course, to the new state of Israel. </p> <p>Argentina was just my first stop, before Uruguay, America, France, Russia and Israel, now the main focus of ORTs attentions, with 80,000 students in 140 schools, universities and technical colleges.

Whereas the workings of schools have gradually gained higher profile in the media, further education has been regarded as a backwater.

By 1997, women principals in colleges numbered 81 (17%) compared with 13 (3%) in 1990. </p> <p>So have conditions improved for women staff in colleges as their star has risen in the last decade? If one considers workload the answer has to be a negative. Women managers in the sector are found mainly at the lower levels (e.g. curriculum management, human resources and student services) where they make up some 60% of the workforce. </p> <p>Since colleges became independent corporations in 1993 it has been at the lower levels of management that the screw has been turned when it has come to making financial savings. There have been roughly 25,000 redundancies from a full-time work force of 135,000 but there has been a huge increase in the numbers of students. </p> <p>This has boosted workloads and those bearing the brunt of these increases have been the women who have taken up many of these middle management posts. </p> <p>Farzana Shain of the Department of Education at Keele University believes that middle managers in colleges perform \"dirty work\". From the statistics on work allocation in colleges Shain concludes: \"Middle management emerges as a key site wherein tensions, stress and examples of bullying behaviour proliferate. This suggests that crisis and stress are increasingly being pushed further down the line to where the majority of the women recruited to management positions since 1993 are located.\" </p> <p>Stress is being piled on as work like budgeting, planning and auditing is passed down without any commensurate reduction in teaching loads. </p> <p>The \"feminisation\" of the sector replicates what has happened in some other professions such as nursing and school teaching. Feminisation takes place when the status of a profession is reduced, there is a decline in pay in real terms, conditions of service get worse and men reject it as an enticing option. </p> <p>Another factor likely to increase the number of men leaving the sector has been government interference in what is taught in college lecture rooms. </p> <p>For some people the exodus of male managers from the sector is not necessarily a bad thing, as Pam Cole of the Department of Educational Studies at Sheffield University discovered when interviewing senior men and women managers in colleges. </p> <p>One male principal found that women staff in their 40s were much more energetic and committed than men. This view was supported by a woman second tier manager who reported that \"There are a lot of dynamic women in their 40s, whilst many men feel that they have done it, got the T-shirt and no longer need to make the effort.\" </p> <p>So, will the feminisation of management in colleges bring about a change in their culture? The jury is still out on this question, but the omens are not encouraging. </p> <p>Rosemary Deem of Lancaster University and her colleagues believe that there is no guarantee that further education colleges will become better places in which to work as a result of the increase in women managers. They are of the opinion that some male managers may adopt a more parenting approach and have greater sensitivity to the feelings of employees. On the other hand, after interviewing college managers they believe: \"Some female managers may choose to adopt aggressive and status/hierarchy-driven approaches to their work. </p> <p>\"We certainly saw signs of this in a few of our female interviewees, notably those who were particularly willing to embrace enterprise and business cultures and take on macho management.\" </p> <p>Farzana Shain echoes this worry as a result of her research findings. \"At first sight there would appear to be a shift towards more feminised styles of management. However, a clear analysis reveals that despite being adopted by many women and some men, this way of managing has not replaced the masculine competitive values that underpin policy and practice in the further education sector.\" </p> <p>Perhaps in the dog-eat-dog climate that has evolved between colleges since 1993 a masculine approach is needed to ensure survival. The market economy may mean that a feminine approach to management is doomed to failure; which is a pity because, as lecturers will confirm, many of our present day colleges are not pleasant places to work in.</p>",

Another factor likely to increase the number of men leaving the sector has been government interference in what is taught in college lecture rooms. For some people the exodus of male managers from the sector is not necessarily a bad thing, as Pam Cole of the Department of Educational Studies at Sheffield University discovered when interviewing senior men and women managers in colleges. One male principal found that women staff in their 40s were much more energetic and committed than men. This view was supported by a woman second tier manager who reported that \"There are a lot of dynamic women in their 40s, whilst many men feel that they have done it, got the T-shirt and no longer need to make the effort.\" So, will the feminisation of management in colleges bring about a change in their culture? The jury is still out on this question, but the omens are not encouraging. Rosemary Deem of Lancaster University and her colleagues believe that there is no guarantee that further education colleges will become better places in which to work as a result of the increase in women managers. They are of the opinion that some male managers may adopt a more parenting approach and have greater sensitivity to the feelings of employees. On the other hand, after interviewing college managers they believe: \"Some female managers may choose to adopt aggressive and status/hierarchy-driven approaches to their work. \"We certainly saw signs of this in a few of our female interviewees, notably those who were particularly willing to embrace enterprise and business cultures and take on macho management.\" Farzana Shain echoes this worry as a result of her research findings. \"At first sight there would appear to be a shift towards more feminised styles of management. However, a clear analysis reveals that despite being adopted by many women and some men, this way of managing has not replaced the masculine competitive values that underpin policy and practice in the further education sector.\" Perhaps in the dog-eat-dog climate that has evolved between colleges since 1993 a masculine approach is needed to ensure survival. The market economy may mean that a feminine approach to management is doomed to failure; which is a pity because, as lecturers will confirm, many of our present day colleges are not pleasant places to work in.",

      "body": "<p>Peter Snow was perturbed. Here he was, about to chair a public debate between journalists, scientists and social scientists. The topic was the vexed relationship between science and the media, and the focal point was a report I had written on scientific communication. But the editor due to defend the press - Rosie Boycott of the Express - had failed to turn up. </p> <p>The report's central charge is that after more than a decade of expensive \"public understanding of science\" programmes, scientists still don't know or care how the media work. And they don't show much sign of understanding how public opinion works either. If science is to make progress in this area, I argue, it needs to pay more attention to social science - a proposition as welcome as an animal rights protester in the lab. </p> <p>The view that science is in trouble with the public is establishment wisdom. BSE, the public revolt over GM foods and medical scandals have all undermined trust in scientists. According to a Mori poll for the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee, which published an important report on science and society earlier this year, fewer than one in five of us are willing to take the word of a \"government scientist\". Independent scientists fare better, but not as well as they used to. </p> <p>The Lords report concluded that \"public unease, mistrust and occasional outright hostility are breeding a climate of deep anxiety among scientists\". It urged a series of remedies, including dropping the label \"public understanding of science\" - which, it argued, smacks of a lost age when scientists said most problems associated with scientific advances were the result of public ignorance. </p> <p>Today such a simple view of the problem is difficult to uphold. Social scientists who analyse the GM controversy or, say, the story of nuclear power, say the difficulties arose because scientists and politicians cut themselves off from opinion and insights outside their circle. Social science argues for a more interactive process of communication between scientists and the public, and for a more open process of negotiation. </p> <p>None of this has discouraged scientists from continuing to talk as if their difficulties with public opinion are primarily to be blamed upon an over-excitable and dumbed down mass media. So far as scientists are concerned, the media form a distorting lens designed to obscure the passage of truth and rational argument. </p> <p>Sir Robert May, the government's chief scientist, was arguing this line just the other day, reprimanding an interviewer on Radio 4's Today programme for taking such a strong interest in Ed Hooper's theory that HIV was transferred to humans as a result of scientific error. The Hopper hypothesis is presumably one of those \"quixotic minority\" views the Royal Society, no less, warns journalists against in the editorial guidelines it has asked the Press Complaints Commission to adopt as part of its editorial code. The Lords Committee recommended that the PCC agree to this dangerous text. </p> <p>The idea that science will prosper by evading controversy or depleting the diversity of viewpoints is surely deeply misguided, if not undemocratic. It arises from the enduring fallacy that scientists can or should be able to control the terms on which the public gets information about science. If this were ever possible, it is surely no longer so in a world of instant, ubiquitous and inter-active media. </p> <p>Equally, the \"distorting lens\" view of the media ignores work by social scientists on the complex meanings of media texts, and their social, historical, political and economic context. For example, a research report written for the House of Lords Committee analysing the GM affair would have us believe that newspapers can be plausibly divided into \"campaigning newspapers\", which tend to distort for effect, and \"reporting newspapers\", which give us things straight. </p> <p>What struck me about the coverage of GM was the way that some of the papers which campaigned most stridently - the Daily Mail for example - also provided large quantities of reasonably well-balanced information and opinion. Equally, it isn't hard to spot the loaded cultural assumptions engraved into every word of that most sober of \"reporting\" newspapers, the Financial Times, which published a leading article on GM food contrasting the relative attractions of \"intellectual barbarism and measured progress\". </p> <p>Likewise when scientists write about the media in specialised journals, they tend to operate upon the assumption that their own work is \"objective\" and unaffected by special interest or cultural context. So far as medical scientists are concerned, the Sun tells you lies, the Lancet tells you the truth. Journalists are slaves of cynical commercial systems, scientists independent truth-tellers. </p> <p>To judge by the debate that Rosie boycotted, however, the scientists may be regrouping for reflection on these matters. Dr Chris Exley, a chemist from Keele University, had been nominated by the British Academy to respond to the report. He said that most of the problems in science communication should be laid at the door of scientists.

      "bodyText": "Peter Snow was perturbed. Here he was, about to chair a public debate between journalists, scientists and social scientists. The topic was the vexed relationship between science and the media, and the focal point was a report I had written on scientific communication. But the editor due to defend the press - Rosie Boycott of the Express - had failed to turn up. The report's central charge is that after more than a decade of expensive \"public understanding of science\" programmes, scientists still don't know or care how the media work. And they don't show much sign of understanding how public opinion works either. If science is to make progress in this area, I argue, it needs to pay more attention to social science - a proposition as welcome as an animal rights protester in the lab. The view that science is in trouble with the public is establishment wisdom. BSE, the public revolt over GM foods and medical scandals have all undermined trust in scientists. According to a Mori poll for the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee, which published an important report on science and society earlier this year, fewer than one in five of us are willing to take the word of a \"government scientist\". Independent scientists fare better, but not as well as they used to. The Lords report concluded that \"public unease, mistrust and occasional outright hostility are breeding a climate of deep anxiety among scientists\". It urged a series of remedies, including dropping the label \"public understanding of science\" - which, it argued, smacks of a lost age when scientists said most problems associated with scientific advances were the result of public ignorance. Today such a simple view of the problem is difficult to uphold. Social scientists who analyse the GM controversy or, say, the story of nuclear power, say the difficulties arose because scientists and politicians cut themselves off from opinion and insights outside their circle. Social science argues for a more interactive process of communication between scientists and the public, and for a more open process of negotiation. None of this has discouraged scientists from continuing to talk as if their difficulties with public opinion are primarily to be blamed upon an over-excitable and dumbed down mass media. So far as scientists are concerned, the media form a distorting lens designed to obscure the passage of truth and rational argument. Sir Robert May, the government's chief scientist, was arguing this line just the other day, reprimanding an interviewer on Radio 4's Today programme for taking such a strong interest in Ed Hooper's theory that HIV was transferred to humans as a result of scientific error. The Hopper hypothesis is presumably one of those \"quixotic minority\" views the Royal Society, no less, warns journalists against in the editorial guidelines it has asked the Press Complaints Commission to adopt as part of its editorial code. The Lords Committee recommended that the PCC agree to this dangerous text. The idea that science will prosper by evading controversy or depleting the diversity of viewpoints is surely deeply misguided, if not undemocratic. It arises from the enduring fallacy that scientists can or should be able to control the terms on which the public gets information about science. If this were ever possible, it is surely no longer so in a world of instant, ubiquitous and inter-active media. Equally, the \"distorting lens\" view of the media ignores work by social scientists on the complex meanings of media texts, and their social, historical, political and economic context. For example, a research report written for the House of Lords Committee analysing the GM affair would have us believe that newspapers can be plausibly divided into \"campaigning newspapers\", which tend to distort for effect, and \"reporting newspapers\", which give us things straight. What struck me about the coverage of GM was the way that some of the papers which campaigned most stridently - the Daily Mail for example - also provided large quantities of reasonably well-balanced information and opinion. Equally, it isn't hard to spot the loaded cultural assumptions engraved into every word of that most sober of \"reporting\" newspapers, the Financial Times, which published a leading article on GM food contrasting the relative attractions of \"intellectual barbarism and measured progress\". Likewise when scientists write about the media in specialised journals, they tend to operate upon the assumption that their own work is \"objective\" and unaffected by special interest or cultural context. So far as medical scientists are concerned, the Sun tells you lies, the Lancet tells you the truth. Journalists are slaves of cynical commercial systems, scientists independent truth-tellers. To judge by the debate that Rosie boycotted, however, the scientists may be regrouping for reflection on these matters. Dr Chris Exley, a chemist from Keele University, had been nominated by the British Academy to respond to the report. He said that most of the problems in science communication should be laid at the door of scientists. Scientists needed to communicate more clearly and engage with alternative perspectives. Professor Steven Rose, director of the Brain and Behaviour Research Group at the Open University, went further. He argued that commercialisation was leading to \"science conducted by megaphone\", with the risk that those scientists most skilled at shouting most loudly would acquire the most influence, regardless of the quality of their work or the independence of their position. The sharpest charge made in the debate was that too many scientists are willing to mislead the public about their work, in pursuit of acclaim or money. Professor Brian Wynne, a scientist turned social scientist from Lancaster University, argued that most science bestsellers were about \"science without consequences\". He said it was the type of science that confronts people in their daily lives which generates real controversy and demands a more consultative approach to decisions based on scientific discoveries. Lord Jenkin, who chaired the House of Lords inquiry, reported strong resistance in scientific circles to his committee's recommendation that the term \"public understanding of science\" be abandoned in favour of the more open \"science and society\". The next test will come in the government's delayed response to the Jenkin report; not least because ministers are often as keen as scientists on the \"media hysteria\" account of science's difficulties with the public. The government should realise that if it does dismiss the Jenkin report, it will align itself with a diminishing and out-of-touch scientific elite. Many younger scientists hold the basic democratic assumption that science should be challenged by citizens on non-scientific grounds, and see the media as a vital, if sometimes boorish, part of that process. 'Everyone is going to try to talk up their area' Interviews by Lee Elliot Major It is a pity Ian Hargreaves does not offer any substantive evidence counter to the points I made in a BBC online debate -that decision makers at the BBC are temperamentally, because of their background, anti-science. One of the mistakes the media make is assuming that to make science interesting, even newsworthy, it has to be packaged in a particular way, emphasising presentation over substance. The kind of science story that attracts attention is often associated with a virtual cult of personality of celebrities. Alleging that scientists misinform the press imputes a Machiavellianism to scientists that is hard to support. I find it hard to believe that there are Max Cliffords in the scientific world plotting to get prions onto the front page of the Sun. Michael Rennie Symers Professor of Physiology, University of Dundee More than half of people polled quite reasonably say that the pace the modern science is such that you cannot trust the government's regulatory machine to keep up with it. It is factually untrue to say that scientists get a bad press. Science is a discipline practised by human beings, not very different from any other human beings, and it is not surprising that among them there are many people who are extremely ambitious, and are not beyond using manipulation of the media for the purpose of heightening the sense of excitement about what they have done. I wouldn't say anyone does so with deliberate dishonesty, but some people let their enthusiams run away with them. Sir Bob May the government's Chief Scientific Adviser Scientists are at least 95% to blame for the bad press they attract. Everyone is going to try to talk up their area, but why is that such a problem? Peter Cotgreave director of save british science Ian Hargreaves is a member of the board of Greenpeace.

Prices vary considerably from region to region; in the most recent NUS survey for 1998/9, the average rent for a self-contained single room in Wales was \u00a338.49 per week, while the figure for London was \u00a355.14.

In theory, the deal cuts well for every one concerned. The university gets to hang on to its hard-pressed cash reserves, the builder gets a near-guaranteed income on its properties and the students benefit from the expertise of a company with up-to-date know-how in student accommodation.

Some students complain about poor-quality furniture, cramped amenity space, promised yet non-existent security guards and rents that are well over the odds. Southampton Institute was caught out charging its students a 20% premium to allow for periods of non-occupancy. Mark Allen, the director of UPP, the largest of the university PFI operators, which handles more than 3,600 student rooms at Manchester, Reading, Plymouth and Luton universities, believes all such practices are now a thing of the past. \"We set the rents in consultation with the universities,\" he says, \"and if we don't price ourselves competitively, we end up with empty rooms.

      "body": "<p>Christopher Fletcher was amazed when he came down to breakfast one morning to find his 14-year-old son Mark in floods of tears, begging not to be sent to school that day. His amazement turned to shock and rage when he found out that some of his son's classmates had set up a web page devoted to Mark. Posted on the site was a variety of abuse and taunts. It had already been seen not only by the pupils in Mark's class, some of whom had accessed it via the computers at their school, but by other children in the area, one of whom had phoned to alert Mark. </p> <p>Christopher already knew that there had been problems in Mark's class and that boys had been picking on each other throughout the year; but he had thought that the situation had been resolved. He was horrified to find that the extremely public humiliation via techno-bullying was the culmination of a sustained campaign directed against his son. </p> <p>\"The internet may be a wonderful thing, but this was just evil; it wasn't a game, it wasn't schoolboy banter, it was a very nasty, public, personal attack,\" he says. \"The page said he was fat, gay, had no friends - and plenty more like that. The site had been accessed via the school computers during the lunch-hours, it had been seen by most of his class, by his peer group, and he was extremely upset.\" </p> <p>The site has been taken down now, as far as Christopher knows; but the damage has been done. \"It's very worrying, because there's no control at all over what goes up on the web.\" </p> <p>It is the first case of this particular kind of techno-bullying that Hereward Harrison, director of policy at Childline, has come across; but, sadly, he's not surprised. \"Young people are very inventive,\" he says. \"We have heard of instances of using text messages on mobile phones to bully other children. The technology for this kind of behaviour is there now, and bullies are turning it to their own ends.\" </p> <p>Similarly, Susan Littlemore, communications director at Parentline Plus, a charity that runs a free help and information service on all aspects of parenting, is concerned but hardly amazed at the emergence of techno-bullying. \"Kids are very ingenious in the ways that they bully each other. Technology is moving on and children today are extremely computer-literate; I should think that any technological framework that's set up to stop children saying horrible things online will quickly be circumvented.\" </p> <p>So what can be done to help children who find themselves in a similar situation to Mark Fletcher? Hereward Harrison says that dealing with techno-bullying starts with gathering evidence and getting adult help. The first step he recommends is to keep a detailed diary of what's happening, including any abusive emails or downloaded web pages, and show it to a parent or teacher. \"Making the situation public is very positive when it comes to bullying. Then you need to set up a meeting between parents, school and the young person themselves, and formulate a plan of action; if necessary go to school governors, or the local education authority. In some cases the intervention of the police has been very effective.\" </p> <p>But when Christopher Fletcher approached his son's school, he found that getting help was not easy. \"They first said that because the site hadn't been concocted on school equipment, it was nothing to do with them. When I pointed out that it had been accessed from school computers, they were more interested. I had a letter from the head saying he had spoken to the boys concerned, but the overall tone was one of 'boys will be boys'. \" </p> <p>Fletcher was sufficiently incensed by this cavalier approach to seek legal advice. \"What the school took some time to appreciate was that Mark has been libelled. It's like putting up a sign on a roundabout that everyone can read. We're entitled to sue for libel on his behalf. I am going to tell the school that if it happens again, we will be suing - taking out injunctions against the parents of the boys concerned, impounding their home computers, and, if school computers were used, impounding those too.\" </p> <p>Christopher Fletcher may not be so far off the mark in thinking about the legal implications of techno-bullying. In April of this year, a professor at the City College in San Francisco launched a libel lawsuit over allegations made by students on a website that he is \" racist and mentally ill\". Daniel Curzon Brown describes the site as \"evil\" and claims that the attacks had made him \"depressed and afraid\". He is currently suing the company that runs the website. </p> <p>According to Susan Littlemore, schools don't always do all they can to help bullied children in more conventional situations, let alone ones aggravated by the use of technology. She says that many parents are let down by teachers, even when their child has been bullied to the end of his or her tether. \"Parents are often surprised by how long their child has managed to conceal the issue, and when the parents find out, it's often an extreme situation by then. Not only is the child disturbed, but the parents are extremely distressed.\" </p> <p> When it comes to techno-bullying, says Littlemore, \"the argument isn't about creating a sterile environment where abuses can't happen, because that's probably impossible\". The way forward, she says, is for schools to set up an anti-bullying policy. \"We are finding this isn't happening. Parents with legitimate concerns who approach their child's school aren't being heard. Getting parents involved is essential. It's easy for those who are delivering education to focus solely on education, which is why parents need to become involved and voice their concerns.\" </p> <p>Teachers, however, would argue that they are beleaguered enough already without adding to their workload. \"It's impossible for teachers to police what's happening outside school - it's difficult enough inside,\" says a spokeswoman for the National Union of Teachers. \"If the teachers are aware of bullying, they can do something about it, but bullied children are often very secretive. Teachers can't see what children are doing on their computers at home; they can't monitor pupils' private lives. That is where parents come in.\" </p> <p>She recommends keeping home computers in shared spaces. \"If the computer is in the living room then you can see on a regular basis as you pass by what your child is doing.\" The computer shouldn't be hidden away in the child's bedroom, she says. \"If the parents of the children involved in this particular case had known what their children were doing, they might have been able to put a stop to it. Parents must monitor home use.\" </p> <p>Littlemore isn't so sure. \"Whenever a community is set up, that community has responsibilities. Schools need to take that on board. When schools say they don't know what to do about bullying or it's not up to them to deal with it, the parents are stuck in the middle - it's very unpleasant.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Next month Parentline Plus is launching an anti-bullying initiative for parents; for more information call their free helpline on 0808 800 2222 (textline 0800 783 6783) or visit <a href=\"http://www.parentlineplus.org.uk\">www.parentlineplus.org.uk</a></p>",

In April of this year, a professor at the City College in San Francisco launched a libel lawsuit over allegations made by students on a website that he is \" racist and mentally ill\". Daniel Curzon Brown describes the site as \"evil\" and claims that the attacks had made him \"depressed and afraid\". He is currently suing the company that runs the website. According to Susan Littlemore, schools don't always do all they can to help bullied children in more conventional situations, let alone ones aggravated by the use of technology. She says that many parents are let down by teachers, even when their child has been bullied to the end of his or her tether. \"Parents are often surprised by how long their child has managed to conceal the issue, and when the parents find out, it's often an extreme situation by then. Not only is the child disturbed, but the parents are extremely distressed.\" When it comes to techno-bullying, says Littlemore, \"the argument isn't about creating a sterile environment where abuses can't happen, because that's probably impossible\". The way forward, she says, is for schools to set up an anti-bullying policy. \"We are finding this isn't happening. Parents with legitimate concerns who approach their child's school aren't being heard. Getting parents involved is essential. It's easy for those who are delivering education to focus solely on education, which is why parents need to become involved and voice their concerns.\" Teachers, however, would argue that they are beleaguered enough already without adding to their workload. \"It's impossible for teachers to police what's happening outside school - it's difficult enough inside,\" says a spokeswoman for the National Union of Teachers. \"If the teachers are aware of bullying, they can do something about it, but bullied children are often very secretive. Teachers can't see what children are doing on their computers at home; they can't monitor pupils' private lives. That is where parents come in.\" She recommends keeping home computers in shared spaces. \"If the computer is in the living room then you can see on a regular basis as you pass by what your child is doing.\" The computer shouldn't be hidden away in the child's bedroom, she says. \"If the parents of the children involved in this particular case had known what their children were doing, they might have been able to put a stop to it. Parents must monitor home use.\" Littlemore isn't so sure. \"Whenever a community is set up, that community has responsibilities. Schools need to take that on board. When schools say they don't know what to do about bullying or it's not up to them to deal with it, the parents are stuck in the middle - it's very unpleasant.\" \u0095 Next month Parentline Plus is launching an anti-bullying initiative for parents; for more information call their free helpline on 0808 800 2222 (textline 0800 783 6783) or visit www.parentlineplus.org.uk",

      "body": "<p>\"I haven't not enjoyed anything at the school, only that I wish school could end later than 3.15pm because I really enjoy learning about things and I also get to be with my friends.\" This is a year six pupil, aged 10, talking about life at West Kidlington Primary School in Oxfordshire. Another year six child suggested that a way of improving the school would be to make playtime shorter and spend more time in class. </p> <p>The reason for this surprising enthusiasm is a programme implemented by Neil Hawkes, headteacher at Kidlington for seven years and now senior education adviser with Oxfordshire County Council. His \"values education\" policy goes way beyond the three Rs. Each month, the school concentrates on a particular value, which could be honesty, respect, tolerance or happiness. The theme is taken up in every classroom lesson: did Henry VIII respect his wives? Subjects that aren't an obvious forum are pulled in as well: an arts class focusing on caring gave the children the task of drawing their hands, but alongside the sketching they were asked to think about what their hands could be used for, and before they put pencil to paper there was a lively discussion on the whole issue. </p> <p>Young children are introduced early to the idea of abstract concepts and, most importantly, trying to understand how others tick (What makes you happy? What makes other people happy?). A year five child, aged nine, who had been studying the concept of simplicity, said: \"Simplicity is beautiful. It means staying in the present, economy, using resources wisely, not wasting things, not being careless, giving time to your friends.\" A response that wouldn't shame someone twice his age. </p> <p>The themes are also addressed in the playground, the dinner hall and the staff room. For example, a child is not told off in public. If there is a problem, they are taken aside, which shows respect from the teacher. In general, the principle is practising what one preaches rather than a \"do as I say, not as I do\" credo. At dinner time, a teacher will show what is expected by praising a quiet group rather than criticising a noisy one - the over-excited children calm down as if by magic. The emphasis, says Hawkes, is as much on implicit teaching as explicit teaching. </p> <p>The core of the values system came from the experience of a long and varied teaching career, including stints as headteacher and school inspector. \"I kept on looking at the society round me and I thought something should be happening in our schools to make everything more civilised,\" says Hawkes. \"I'm very disturbed by violence and anti-social behaviour and I wanted to see if a school could effect a qualitative change in pupils by thinking about values.\" These values could equally be called virtues or principles, he says: they are basically the tenets that guide civilised behaviour, the fundamental building blocks of cultures and societies worldwide. </p> <p>The success of the pilot scheme at West Kidlington is not, Hawkes insists, based on any kind of fluffy notion of \"Let's all just be nice to each other\". \"It's not a cuddly-cuddly soft approach,\" he says. \"It's highly disciplined and extremely focused.

      "bodyText": "\"I haven't not enjoyed anything at the school, only that I wish school could end later than 3.15pm because I really enjoy learning about things and I also get to be with my friends.\" This is a year six pupil, aged 10, talking about life at West Kidlington Primary School in Oxfordshire. Another year six child suggested that a way of improving the school would be to make playtime shorter and spend more time in class. The reason for this surprising enthusiasm is a programme implemented by Neil Hawkes, headteacher at Kidlington for seven years and now senior education adviser with Oxfordshire County Council. His \"values education\" policy goes way beyond the three Rs. Each month, the school concentrates on a particular value, which could be honesty, respect, tolerance or happiness. The theme is taken up in every classroom lesson: did Henry VIII respect his wives? Subjects that aren't an obvious forum are pulled in as well: an arts class focusing on caring gave the children the task of drawing their hands, but alongside the sketching they were asked to think about what their hands could be used for, and before they put pencil to paper there was a lively discussion on the whole issue. Young children are introduced early to the idea of abstract concepts and, most importantly, trying to understand how others tick (What makes you happy? What makes other people happy?). A year five child, aged nine, who had been studying the concept of simplicity, said: \"Simplicity is beautiful. It means staying in the present, economy, using resources wisely, not wasting things, not being careless, giving time to your friends.\" A response that wouldn't shame someone twice his age. The themes are also addressed in the playground, the dinner hall and the staff room. For example, a child is not told off in public. If there is a problem, they are taken aside, which shows respect from the teacher. In general, the principle is practising what one preaches rather than a \"do as I say, not as I do\" credo. At dinner time, a teacher will show what is expected by praising a quiet group rather than criticising a noisy one - the over-excited children calm down as if by magic. The emphasis, says Hawkes, is as much on implicit teaching as explicit teaching. The core of the values system came from the experience of a long and varied teaching career, including stints as headteacher and school inspector. \"I kept on looking at the society round me and I thought something should be happening in our schools to make everything more civilised,\" says Hawkes. \"I'm very disturbed by violence and anti-social behaviour and I wanted to see if a school could effect a qualitative change in pupils by thinking about values.\" These values could equally be called virtues or principles, he says: they are basically the tenets that guide civilised behaviour, the fundamental building blocks of cultures and societies worldwide. The success of the pilot scheme at West Kidlington is not, Hawkes insists, based on any kind of fluffy notion of \"Let's all just be nice to each other\". \"It's not a cuddly-cuddly soft approach,\" he says. \"It's highly disciplined and extremely focused. It makes great demands on the staff, who have to be very consistent, and they have been splendid and backed me 100%.\" This is reflected in the school's academic results: although 30% of the pupils have educational difficulties, in the latest round of SATs over 90% of pupils at key stage 2 (ages seven to 11) achieved level four or above. Attendance has improved, too; days off during term through illness are \"negligible\", says Hawkes. Other advantages are less quantifiable; pupils, parents and visitors talk about a \"special\" atmosphere. Ellen Gardner, whose four children all attend the school, particularly enjoys the assemblies - a key part of the values scheme, says Hawkes. \"It's amazing how they get that many kids in that hall and they're so quiet,\" says Gardner. \"I notice that no one drags their feet when they're walking in, they stand nice and straight, their heads high.

      "body": "<p>Vanisha Chohan is 11 years old. This morning, she will sit by her window and watch her friends go past in their brand new uniforms. Tonight, they will phone her and tell her all about their new friends and teachers. Nearly three weeks into their first term of secondary school, they are beginning to settle in. </p> <p>Vanisha does not go to school. It's not that she doesn't want to - she is not ill, or a truant. Nor is hers some middle-class protest - her parents are not keeping her at home because she didn't get into the school of her choice. When the school year began Vanisha didn't start because she couldn't. She had no school to go to. </p> <p>Her parents put her name down for three local schools in the normal way, but Vanisha did not get into any of them. In fact the only school that has offered her a place - last week, after her mother made a great deal of fuss - is more than and hour an a half's journey away in Croydon. </p> <p>How can this happen? Surely every child has a right to an education in a school within a reasonable distance of their home? Mrs Chohan thought so, too: \"I am at a complete loss. We applied to the schools nearest to the house because I thought that those living nearest got priority. We live on the edge of Lambeth, but our nearest schools were all in Croydon. When we failed to get into any of them I was told that I should have applied to Lambeth in the first place. So I contacted Lambeth, who told me they couldn't help - all their schools were full.\" The appeals process got her nowhere, \"So I went further afield to try and find a school that Vanisha could travel to, but she didn't get into those either.\" </p> <p>Vanisha is one of an unknown number of children who, several weeks into the school year, remain \"unplaced\". While the Department for Education was unable to give any precise figures, and Lambeth could make no comment, there are definitely others. </p> <p>At the beginning of the summer, the London borough of Camden, for example, had 73 \"unplaced\" children - a higher number than ever before. When the parents of the children contacted Camden's education department they were told to take places available in schools outside the borough in Brent, Westminster, Hackney and Barnet. </p> <p>Now, three weeks into the school year, 15 still have no secondary school to go to according to the borough's own figures. But these figures don't include children like 11-year-old Eva Oddi, one of the original 73 whose mother has now sent her to a fee-paying college as a stopgap. \"It is not a long-term solution,\" says her mother, Polly Stringer. \"It not financially viable for us and it's not the kind of social mix that Eva feels comfortable in and is used to.\" </p> <p>Where Mrs Chohan was told that her failure to apply to schools in her borough was her mistake, Mrs Stringer was told the exact opposite. Her mistake, apparently, was to apply only to schools in Camden. Both parents feel bewildered. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Vanisha's mother leaves her daughter at home alone. She tells her not to answer the door to anyone, and rings her on the hour to make sure she is alright. In between phone calls, she is desperately worried. </p> <p>Vanisha is just desperate: \"I really liked school. Maybe my SATs results were not good enough for anyone to want me. I am so bored and if I try to imagine the days ahead there is nothing. Just a blank.\" </p> <p>Like Vanisha, Eva finds it difficult to cope with continued rejection. \"There was such a big build up during the last year of primary school,\" she says. \"All my efforts were a waste of time. When my friends were going to open days welcoming them into their new schools, I was left thinking, Why me? But I do know there are others in the same position. </p> <p>\"One boy I know still has nowhere to go, and Mum saw him hanging around outside our old primary school yesterday because he was so bored. I hope that I find a place soon. I am in a class with 9-year-olds at the moment. I miss my own age group.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Education confirmed that each child has a legal and democratic right to be educated and added that, \"The responsibility for that education lies with the education department of the borough within which the child lives and is educated.\" </p> <p>In practice, the exact nature of that responsibility appears open to debate. All local education authorities (LEAs) have secondary school places for the number of children that go to primary schools within the borough. However, thanks to the \"Greenwich judgment\" of 1989, children who live close to the school but in another borough or who have siblings at the school take priority over those simply living and already being schooled there. </p> <p>When questioned about the \"unplaced\" of Camden, councillor Stephen Hocking cited the Greenwich judgement, adding: \"it is unfortunate that we have a number of good schools which are right on the borough borders\". Camden council believes they have fulfilled their legal responsibility to Eva and the others by making it clear to each parent that there was a place open to them somewhere, albeit miles away in another borough. </p> <p>A Camden spokesman said, \"By finding a school that was able to educate the individual child we are enabling that child to find a school place. If the parents choose not to send their child to these schools then it is difficult to know what we can do.\" </p> <p>However, Russell Clarke, the deputy secretary of the Secondary Heads Association (SHA) says that the Greenwich judgment does not absolve the responsibility of a local authority to educate the children within the borough. \"The 1944 Education Act states that all children from the age of 5 until 16 should be educated,\" he says. \"That surely means that there must be a school for that child to go to. If local authorities are given resources by the government to educate the children in their area, and if they are failing to do that, then it certainly raises enormous political questions.\" </p> <p>But even if one accepts Camden's interpretation of the Greenwich judgment, that would only explain Eva's predicament. What about Vanisha's? Surely, according to the Greenwich judgment, Vanisha should have been schooled at her nearest secondary school rather then being told that she should have chosen schools further away but in her borough first? </p> <p>\"The admissions policies of the local authorities are very confusing and vary from borough to borough,\" explains Margaret Morrissey of the Parent Teachers Association. \"I have all the leaflets and I still find it hard to know what individual admissions policies will be each year. They are interpreted differently by different schools and they change from year to year.\" </p> <p>A confusing situation is made worse by the fact that many parents now \"shop around\" for the best school they can find. \"There is a direct conflict between parents being allowed to choose and the LEA's obligation to educate those within the borough,\" says Morrissey. \"It used to work itself out. Over the last few years it has got much worse.\" </p> <p>It certainly has, says the mother of another child who is cycling up and down the street instead of starting school. She is anxious not to be named because she feels that she has already made so much fuss and it has not helped her get a secondary place for her son, but says: \"I know of a number of cases in which people pretended to split up and the father rented accommodation near the school and then moved back home as soon as they had got one child in. Others have swapped houses with grandparents for a while. Parents will do anything to get their child into a good school, and my child has to suffer. I was offered schools miles outside the borough but I don't want my son travelling to get to a school that we know nothing about, and that none of his friends go to. It makes a mockery of the idea of local schools and makes me resent paying my council tax.\" </p> <p>Graham Lane, the chairman of the Local Government Association's education committee, has a simpler explanation: \"There are simply not enough schools to educate children whose numbers are being swelled all the time by asylum seekers and the increased mobility of families. Our schools are full.\" </p> <p>It seems, then, that a combination of factors are to blame for the \"unplaced\": confusing admissions policies; parental choice; parents bending rules to secure a place at their first choice school; and a need for more schools to educate a growing population. </p> <p>All of which does not help children like Eva and Vanisha. As Russell Clarke of the SHA says, \"missing the graduation into a secondary school will be highly damaging to the individual child. I should think that it would be terrible to feel left out of something you had to come to anticipate and expect.\" </p> <p>He recommends taking legal advice and contacting the child's local MP but above all taking each case to the secretary of state who holds the ultimate responsibility to educate every child. \"All I know is that if a child of mine had been let down like this I would create one hell of a stink.\"</p>",

He seemed to recognise places he had not seen for more than 50 years, people at the reunion said.</p> <p>The visit to the village near the Ukrainian border fitted a key piece to a puzzle which began in the summer when Hungary learned of a soldier who had been held for 50 years in a Russian psychiatric hospital and whose identity was uncertain.</p> <p>His return, and the investigation by military and medical experts to establish his identity, has since gripped the country.</p> <p>The latest revelations have come as a blow to the 82 families who had claimed him as their missing relative - about 600,000 Hungarians were taken to the Soviet Union as prisoners during and after the second world war.</p> <p>Andras Veer, director of the Hungarian national psychiatry and neurology institute, said experts managed to track down the relatives from the old man's fragmented memories.</p> <p><strong> Captured</strong></p> <p> \"He told us in which village he worked as a blacksmith's apprentice, where he was born and where he went to school, even the name of his teacher,\" Mr Veer said. That led to a number of tiny villages near the town of Nyiregyhaza, and then to Sulyanbokor, a village of about 40 farmsteads.</p> <p>\"He remembered lots of things, including names, and we also have the documents proving when he disappeared - everything,\" Janos Toma said.</p> <p>Janos was only seven, and Anna one, when Mr Toma, then 19, was captured by the Soviet army in the autumn of 1944.

      "bodyText": "The mystery of the identity of the second world war soldier who returned to his native Hungary five weeks ago after 55 years of captivity in Russia appears to have been solved. Andras Toma - not Andras Tamas, as he was previously thought to be - was reunited with his brother and sister in the small village of Sulyanbokor, eastern Hungary, on Saturday morning. Only DNA tests will prove they are related, but there seems to be little doubt in the minds of the doctors and military officers who have been caring for him since his return. \"Everyone in the room wept, including me,\" said Colonel Laszlo Erdos, head of the defence ministry team which has been researching the PoW's past, as Mr Toma, 75, embraced his brother Janos and sister Anna. \"He looks exactly like our late father,\" his sister said. Mr Toma was then taken to his old school, where he met former classmates. He seemed to recognise places he had not seen for more than 50 years, people at the reunion said. The visit to the village near the Ukrainian border fitted a key piece to a puzzle which began in the summer when Hungary learned of a soldier who had been held for 50 years in a Russian psychiatric hospital and whose identity was uncertain. His return, and the investigation by military and medical experts to establish his identity, has since gripped the country. The latest revelations have come as a blow to the 82 families who had claimed him as their missing relative - about 600,000 Hungarians were taken to the Soviet Union as prisoners during and after the second world war. Andras Veer, director of the Hungarian national psychiatry and neurology institute, said experts managed to track down the relatives from the old man's fragmented memories. Captured \"He told us in which village he worked as a blacksmith's apprentice, where he was born and where he went to school, even the name of his teacher,\" Mr Veer said. That led to a number of tiny villages near the town of Nyiregyhaza, and then to Sulyanbokor, a village of about 40 farmsteads. \"He remembered lots of things, including names, and we also have the documents proving when he disappeared - everything,\" Janos Toma said. Janos was only seven, and Anna one, when Mr Toma, then 19, was captured by the Soviet army in the autumn of 1944. He spent his 20th birthday in a prisoner of war camp east of Leningrad, where Soviet medical records first mentioned him, under the name Andras Tamas, in January 1945. In 1947, as the camp closed, he was transferred to a mental hospital. He had learned only a few Russian words and he barely communicated with the world in the next 53 years. Sulyanbokor, where he grew up and where his brother and sister still live, is about 10 miles west of Nyiregyhaza, the county capital. It is a flat landscape, part of the \"bush-world\" as it is known locally - where the word bokor, meaning bush, is added to every farm name. He is believed to have served an apprenticeship as a blacksmith there before being conscripted into the Hungarian army. He probably took part in the joint German/Hungarian defence of Nyiregyhaza. His father also fought in the war. Sitting in a doctor's room at the institute of psychiatry in Budapest, which has been his home since he returned to Hungary, Mr Toma seemed both lost in his memories and alert to what was going on around him. He spoke all the time, prompted by Col Erdos, who acts as his \"interpreter\". He has no teeth - new ones are being fitted this week - and his pronunciation of often old-fashioned Hungarian, dotted with occasional Russian, is hard to follow. Researchers were led to the \"bush-world\" near Nyiregyhaza by Mr Toma himself. He began to mention the names of places and relatives. As I sat with him, Col Erdos gave him a gift of palinka - Hungarian plum brandy - distilled close to where he was born. Mr Toma sniffed the bottle approvingly. \"Not like that foreign stuff you tried on me the other day,\" he joked - he speaks so much of alcohol his carers offered him a small glass of whisky last week. Amid the flood of his memories it is almost impossible to direct his line of thought. He speaks one moment of a church, then of taking part in the construction of a building, the next moment of the roar of cannon during battle. And, increasing the problems confronting researchers, he refuses to write anything down, and shows no sense of time in his recollections. The church could have been one of the Protestant establishments which dot the landscape of eastern Hungary - most Hungarians are Catholic.

He often mentions a \"five pengo photograph\", perhaps one taken of him in his new uniform before he was taken off to fight. He also frequently mentions scenes connected with his work as a blacksmith, shoeing the cavalry officers' horses. Now that his identity is almost certain, the remaining missing pieces of his past should be easier to find. Janos, a retired farmer, is cautious: \"We're sure he is ours, but we're not saying any more until the tests prove it.\" That could take two weeks. Many of the wartime Hungarian prisoners were civilians, rounded up on the streets by the conquering Russian army and transported east in cattle-trucks to rebuild the Soviet Union. One in three of them died of cold, disease, and malnutrition. The last mass returns took place in 1954.

On either side of the shark-infested divide lie totally different identities - one individual and competitive, the other collective and easygoing. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the treachorous waters between Havana and Miami have provided the setting for the climactic dramas of recent Cuban history: the mass boatlift of 1980, the shooting down of exile pilots by the Cuban Air Force in 1996, and, of course, the discovery at sea last November of a five-year-old shipwreck survivor called Elian Gonzalez. </p> <p>The same patch of ocean is also the setting for the pivotal scene in Outcast, a new novel by the Cuban writer, Jos\u00e9 Latour, which uses crime fiction to portray the two poles of the Cuban experience as a stark and somewhat depressing choice: a repressive economic failure on one side of the Straits, and a sleazy underworld on the other. Halfway between the two, Outcast's anti-hero, a Havana schoolteacher named Elliot Steil, finds himself cast into the waters and forced to survive in the eddying currents. </p> <p>Outcast was first discovered by a small New York art-house publisher called Akashic Books, but now it is about to hit the big time. Rights have been bought by a string of European publishing giants, and by Harper Collins in the US and the UK, where it is due to be published next year. Hollywood is interested in the film rights. The book will soon be too internationally visible for the Cuban government to ignore, and what happens to Latour now will be a measure of how far the regime has gone towards relaxing its cultural vigilance. </p> <p>In the circumstances, it is an extremely brave book. It contains the most unflinching depiction of life under Fidel Castro to have emerged from Cuba for years - an insider's account of survival through the poverty-stricken \"Special Period\" of the early 90s. But it casts an equally cold eye on the corruption-riddled world of the Cuban-American exiles in Miami. </p> <p>In his family's modest Havana apartment where he lives with his wife and two children, the 60-year- old author, a former civil servant at the Cuban ministry of sugar, waits to see what will happen next. He seems more amused than anxious. </p> <p>\"If I spent my time worrying about what they [the government] thought, I would never write another word,\" Latour says. However, he thinks the days are past in Cuba when a writer like himself would routinely be thrown in prison. </p> <p>\"If I had written this book in the 70s, I would have been sent to jail. The problems were the same, but the intolerance was much more severe,\" he argues. The government, however, is still inclined to lock up the occasional dissident, and Latour's writing does appear to test the limits of its supposed new-found tolerance. </p> <p>His last crime novel, The Fool, was the tale of a couple of corrupt Cuban intelligence agents who arrange to launder Colombian drug money through sugar deals on the the New York Stock Exchange. His Cuban state-run publishers would not touch it, but Latour is entirely unrepentant: \"They are the ones who close their eyes to reality. In the 1980s all Cubans learned that in real life several persons in top positions were convicted for different crimes, like embezzlement of government funds and drug smuggling,\" he says. \"So why should Cuban crime literature avoid dealing with our problems? I refuse to practise self-censorship. I have the right to write what I want.\" </p> <p>For several months this year, the big billboard's near Latour's house were filled with the angelic face of little Elian, the Cuban martyr. Latour - like practically everyone on the island, whatever their political beliefs - was outraged by the machinations of the Miami exiles in their attempts to keep the boy away from his father. It was a rare rallying point in cynical times, and the party made the most of it. But now Elian is home, and the regime is struggling to keep the momentum of popular fervour going. Elian's face has now been replaced by a slogan in red on white: \"ABAJO LA LEY DE AJUSTE CUBANO\" (DOWN WITH THE CUBAN ADJUSTMENT ACT). It refers to the US legislation that offers Cubans the prospect of citizenship if they can make it to dry land. If they are caught in the open sea, they can be returned to Cuba. Havana blames the act for luring so many ambitious or desperate Cubans into the Florida Straits on no more than rafts and car inner tubes. But as rallying calls go, it somehow lacks Elian's human intensity. </p> <p>Latour can only sigh in exhaustion at the party's new mobilising strategy. \"The problem with Cuba now is that there are a thousand who believe we should keep up this crazy fervour struggling against American laws, but there are 10 million who don't,\" he says. \"But this tiny minority will prevail because their thinking is in line with the government. Most people are sick and tired with ideological issues.\" </p> <p>Elliot Steil, the hapless social outcast of Latour's new book, has hitherto been too attached to the good things about Cuba (\"the kindness inherent in most people was baffling; race relations were harmonious, the lifestyle easygoing and romantic, the women beautiful, the climate great\") to seriously consider trying to emigrate or floating to Florida on a raft. But then a mysterious American turns up, offering to facilitate Steil's flight to the US, in honour of a promise he once made to the schoolteacher's late father. </p> <p>But the apparent saviour turns into his nemesis on the open sea. The secret of the stranger's identity and his reasons for wishing Steil dead can only be found in Miami, where he washes up, a bedraggled survivor. </p> <p>Back in Havana, Outcast's success has brought Latour all manner of excitement, but some absurd new complications at the same time. He pulls out a movie contract. The studio is keen but there is a problem with sanctions. They can't pay a Cuban, even if that Cuban is an independent-minded man like Latour. The lawyers are looking at the situation. Latour can only laugh. There is probably trouble brewing for him in Havana, but he cannot bring himself to make the crossing so many others dream about, and become an American.</p>",
