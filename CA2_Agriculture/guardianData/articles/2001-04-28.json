The former Leeds United manager was old-fashioned enough to believe Tottenham Hotspur a bigger club, while the present one was perceptive enough to prove him wrong. </p> <p>O'Leary does not put it quite as starkly as that, but is almost as succinct in his analysis. 'When George Graham left he felt Leeds was a top-10 sort of team,' O'Leary said. 'I thought we could be top-three, and tried to drive us on a bit. I wanted us to make a name for ourselves around Europe. The trouble was I could only afford to buy David Batty that year, but I knew I had three or four kids I could put in the first team, and that was like getting several new players.' </p> <p>There can be little doubt which manager saw the future most clearly, and with Leeds in contention for another top-three finish and carrying the flag for English football in the Champions League semi-finals on Wednesday, small wonder O'Leary is being linked with some of the biggest jobs at home and abroad. What Leeds have achieved in the past two years is all the more remarkable because they refuse to compete with the eye-watering salaries on offer at Old Trafford or Anfield, and have built a team to take on the might of Europe with something approaching parsimony. </p> <p>Yes, Rio Ferdinand was a splash at \u00a318 million, but a large proportion of that outlay has been recovered from continued success in Europe, and the young England international was never exactly a gamble. As Dominic Matteo said this week, people have stopped talking about Ferdinand's fee and started to concentrate on how well he has been playing. </p> <p>Leeds obviously felt they needed to make a statement like breaking the transfer record to demonstrate ambition to both supporters and players but, whereas Manchester United can just go out and buy a Ruud van Nistelrooy as a sort of comfort purchase to banish their end-of-season blues, O'Leary is obliged to count the pennies. Robbie Keane has just been signed, but Leeds had to sell Matthew Jones and Darren Huckerby to raise the money. 'We cannot compete with Manchester United financially,' O'Leary said flatly. 'We have to have a slightly different agenda. All our signings have to work - we can't afford players coming here for a swansong, we just want lads who are hungry to do well. We also want to put value into players, so when they leave they are worth more.' </p> <p>Most managers would say the same, perhaps, but it is worth bearing in mind that Matteo, who fits the above bill perfectly and is already worth more than the \u00a33.75m Leeds paid for him, said he came to Leeds because he wanted to improve. You don't hear many Liverpool players saying that, but Matteo has achieved everything he set out to do. As Liverpool only traded him because they were keen to buy the inconsistent Christian Ziege, it leaves O'Leary's judgment looking a tad sharper than that of his friend G\u00e9rard Houllier. </p> <p>Consider also that Keane, with no shortage of offers after he fell out of favour at Inter Milan, actually chose Leeds in spite of the fact that at the time they couldn't afford him. 'Inter were very good about it,' O'Leary said. 'They didn't have to sell Robbie to us, but because he had expressed the desire to join us they let us put a million down and gave us time to find the rest.' </p> <p>Keane is cup-tied for Wednesday's first leg against Valencia, having foolishly imagined Inter would go further in the Champions League than Leeds, but even that could prove a blessing, since to tamper with the team at this stage might upset the closeness and chemistry which has brought O'Leary's side so far. </p> <p>'Good play has got us here, but there is a good spirit and a special camaraderie too,' O'Leary said. 'Naturally we are all enjoying it, but the great thing from my point of view is that we are learning all the time as well. We will have learned from the last match, against Deportivo, for instance. We got out of jail a bit there, but after a game like that you have a better idea of what to expect next time. I'm especially pleased to be in a semi-final again after what happened last year. We didn't learn anything from playing Galatasaray. Everything just went flat because of the tragedy. We came home and started dealing with funerals and so on, and quite rightly no one gave a thought to the football.' </p> <p>No one was giving much of a thought to Leeds' European ambitions this season either, when they kicked off Group H with a 4-0 thrashing in Barcelona. They might have struggled in that group had not a last-minute mistake by the Milan goalkeeper gifted them an unexpected three points in their first home match, but from then onwards, with players returning and confidence soaring, Leeds have been writing their own scripts. </p> <p>'I suppose that might have been a turning point, but as far as I am concerned everything has been a bonus since that very first qualification game against 1860 Munich,' O'Leary said. 'We had such a mish-mash of a team out that night, with Gary Kelly and Lucas Radebe playing in midfield, that I thought if we could get through this we could get through anything.' </p> <p>So it has proved, with the exception of the Nou Camp. 'That was the only place we were totally overwhelmed,' O'Leary said. 'But then we had seven players missing, so what could we expect but a spanking?' </p> <p>The experience did not appear to cause lasting damage and, after escaping from the first group stage Leeds even began to fancy themselves by the second. 'We had already passed a target,' O'Leary explained. 'I set the players goals. I kept telling them that Arsenal's fabulous Double-winning side, with all its World Cup winners, had never managed to get out of the first group in two attempts. The challenge was to do what Arsenal had never done, and we cracked it first time. After that I thought the biggest turning point was the home game against Anderlecht. We weren't playing particularly well, they scored first, but we managed to haul ourselves back and take three points. I knew we were making progress then. I take great pride in being in the semi-finals, especially as we are the only English team left. I'd love one or two more for company, but there's a satisfaction in being the last.' </p> <p>Leeds have last year's beaten finalists for company instead. 'I watched them last season and was really excited, I thought they were fantastic,' O'Leary said. 'I hoped they would win, but they ran into a really great team in the final. The Spanish league is excellent, and maybe Valencia are a bit like us. Not as rich or as famous as Real or Barcelona, but a hard-working team capable of playing good football.' </p> <p>Valencia may be industrious, but few teams have had as hard a season as Leeds. This fairytale comes at a cost. 'We have all stuck together, but it feels like we've been bogged down for months and months,' O'Leary said. 'I'm excited but tired, more mentally tired than anything. Personally I can't wait for the season to finish - it's been a flaming nightmare.'</p>",

A reminder, if it be needed, that Keane will retaliate and should anyone be foolish enough to enter into a cycle of violence with him he will have the final word. </p> <p>So it was not entirely surprising that Keane did not apologise for the dreadful tackle. One suspects he says sorry rarely, if at all. And he certainly wasn't going to start by putting on a fake show of remorse for something that was so clearly premeditated. Nor was his capo, Sir Alex Ferguson, going to wade in and do the apologising for him. He responded in the time-honoured fashion by saying he had seen nothing. And if the questioning had continued he would have called in his lawyers. </p> <p>Thus it is that an assault that should have been met with a hefty punishment, a period of contrition from Keane, and a diminution in Keane's power base has instead led to a consolidation of his position. Ferguson will publicly criticise Beckham for missing training to stay at home with baybee but he won't say a word against the golden boy. </p> <p>Ferguson knows that Keane is the best midfielder in Europe. Ferguson is aware that the only season they failed to win the Premiership recently was the one that Keane missed because of the injury after his tangle with Haaland. Ferguson is certain that the only player he needs above all others for a successful final season is Keane. He would be prepared to let Giggs, Beckham or Cole go; at a stretch, let all three go, as long as Keane stayed. He is the numero uno , without whom the others can't parade their fancy tricks and fluent touches. </p> <p>And now Keane knows how strong his position is. He is first among equals and quite happy to start slagging off his inferiors. In the past week he has called them complacent, criticised them for their weakness for celebrity and their showbiz lifestyles, and claimed that P45s are on their way. </p> <p>In response, an unnamed team-mate was quoted as saying: 'The lads were livid. It is like Roy has become a law unto himself, they were all talking about it at breakfast.' Ooh er, missus. Keane must be terrified. All of them, drinking their lattes, reading OK! and saying: 'I'm livid I am.' And did any of them say it to his face? Would you? </p> <p>He has good grounds for his frustration. For long periods of the game in Munich he was carrying the whole team. He was desperate to prove that they could beat Bayern with him in the team. He was desperate to win a European Cup Final. And his team-mates let him down. And if they do that some of them will have to go. No argument. No debate. Europe is the priority. </p> <p>And after they have won the European Cup again in Keane's perfect world the Republic of Ireland would meet England in the 2002 World Cup Final. Keane v Beckham, Keane v Scholes, Keane v Butt, Keane v Cole, Keane v G Neville, Keane v P Neville. He would take them all on one after the other and consecutively like a chess grandmaster moving from table to table to squish inferior opponents. And the frightening thing is that he would probably win. </p> <p>He has been the pre-eminent footballer in the English League for the past decade, the only one to play for arguably the two best managers of all-time, Ferguson and Brian Clough. And one sideline of the Haaland incident and the internal spat that followed it has been Cloughie wading in to rollock Ferguson for not keeping Keane under control and creating the problem by his lenient approach to past offences. Perhaps so. But Cloughie didn't spend much time publicly slagging off Kenny Burns or whoever else was entrusted with the role of enforcer. Clough, of all people, knows Keane's value. And he knows even better that it is in his best interest to stir the unrest, because if Ferguson wins the European Cup again, he will have fair claim to have been an even greater manager than Clough.

      "body": "<p>Nobody knows how good he is. Ruud van Nistelrooy, the British game's most expensive player ever, has played perhaps six matches in his career against top-class teams. The \u00a319 million Manchester United paid for him must be a gamble. Still, from his seven years in Dutch professional football, one can deduce something. </p> <p>The first thing to say is that \u00a319 million is not what it was a year ago. Last spring, when United bid a similar figure, it was the price of guaranteed success. That was in the days when it looked as if the transfer system might be abolished, before Luis Figo went for \u00a336 million, and before the latest munificent Sky contract that made the previous one look like something out of Albanian football. Today, \u00a319 million is the price of a punt. </p> <p>When Van Nistelrooy arrives at United he will be 25, middle-aged for a striker, yet he is still quite unproven. Born by magical coincidence on the same day as Patrick Kluivert (1 July, 1976), he hasn't a quarter of Kluivert's cv. By the summer of 1995, when Kluivert had scored the winning goal in the Champions League final, Van Nistelrooy's career amounted to three goals in 17 games for FC Den Bosch. Euro 2000 should have been his stage, but he spent it nursing his torn knee ligament at a clinic in Vail, Colorado. (He watched the matches on satellite television, and touched the Dutch nation by cheering Holland's goals in the manner of an eight-year-old fan, waving his crutches frantically in the air, conduct that most Dutch internationals would have considered quite non-U.) </p> <p>Van Nistelrooy has a monstrous scoring record, 60 league goals in his previous two seasons for PSV, but then that is in what Brian Clough liked to call the Mickey Mouse League. Take the striker's two hat-tricks against Ajax in the 1999-2000 season: for one goal in the Amsterdam Arena, he ran through the entire Ajax defence without once being tackled, and after his second hat-trick, in Eindhoven, he said he hadn't played well. This is not like playing Bayern Munich. </p> <p>Nor has his play quite recovered since his return from injury in March. He does not yet look sharp. He has five goals in eight games, a mediocre return for him, and his goal as a substitute for Holland against Cyprus on Wednesday, his second in 11 internationals, followed numerous misses. The medics say he has made a full recovery - 'You have a fine knee,' Manchester United's doctor told him last week - but Van Nistelrooy himself will probably only believe it when he sees it. </p> <p>Yet the view in Holland is that he is, in local football parlance, 'a real one'. Van Nistelrooy has the directness of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink combined with something of the touch of Kluivert. He may be the most all-round centre-forward since Gabriel Batistuta.

      "bodyText": "Nobody knows how good he is. Ruud van Nistelrooy, the British game's most expensive player ever, has played perhaps six matches in his career against top-class teams. The \u00a319 million Manchester United paid for him must be a gamble. Still, from his seven years in Dutch professional football, one can deduce something. The first thing to say is that \u00a319 million is not what it was a year ago. Last spring, when United bid a similar figure, it was the price of guaranteed success. That was in the days when it looked as if the transfer system might be abolished, before Luis Figo went for \u00a336 million, and before the latest munificent Sky contract that made the previous one look like something out of Albanian football. Today, \u00a319 million is the price of a punt. When Van Nistelrooy arrives at United he will be 25, middle-aged for a striker, yet he is still quite unproven. Born by magical coincidence on the same day as Patrick Kluivert (1 July, 1976), he hasn't a quarter of Kluivert's cv. By the summer of 1995, when Kluivert had scored the winning goal in the Champions League final, Van Nistelrooy's career amounted to three goals in 17 games for FC Den Bosch. Euro 2000 should have been his stage, but he spent it nursing his torn knee ligament at a clinic in Vail, Colorado. (He watched the matches on satellite television, and touched the Dutch nation by cheering Holland's goals in the manner of an eight-year-old fan, waving his crutches frantically in the air, conduct that most Dutch internationals would have considered quite non-U.) Van Nistelrooy has a monstrous scoring record, 60 league goals in his previous two seasons for PSV, but then that is in what Brian Clough liked to call the Mickey Mouse League. Take the striker's two hat-tricks against Ajax in the 1999-2000 season: for one goal in the Amsterdam Arena, he ran through the entire Ajax defence without once being tackled, and after his second hat-trick, in Eindhoven, he said he hadn't played well. This is not like playing Bayern Munich. Nor has his play quite recovered since his return from injury in March. He does not yet look sharp. He has five goals in eight games, a mediocre return for him, and his goal as a substitute for Holland against Cyprus on Wednesday, his second in 11 internationals, followed numerous misses. The medics say he has made a full recovery - 'You have a fine knee,' Manchester United's doctor told him last week - but Van Nistelrooy himself will probably only believe it when he sees it. Yet the view in Holland is that he is, in local football parlance, 'a real one'. Van Nistelrooy has the directness of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink combined with something of the touch of Kluivert. He may be the most all-round centre-forward since Gabriel Batistuta. He is two-footed, can head, runs all the time, and would not be a Dutch footballer if he couldn't read the game. And then there is the passion. With his long dark hair, his habit of crossing himself on the pitch, and his existential desire to score, Van Nistelrooy appears more Latin American than Dutch. Wim Kieft, himself a very decent striker for Holland, wrote in the Dutch magazine Voetbal International : 'J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann aside, I've never seen a striker with such a will to win duels, who has such feeling for space, is always moving, makes 44 movements before getting the ball or tries to get behind his opponent. It drives the defender mad.' Johan Cruyff adds in the same magazine: 'Especially technically Van Nistelrooy has a lot to learn.' But then Cruyff thinks Kluivert's technique is merely 'reasonable'. Kluivert himself is his lost twin's greatest fan, singling him out among the legion of Dutch strikers as the one he longs to play with.

      "byline": "Bill Bradshaw",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Chances are you won't have heard of Shaun Murray. Or if you have, you may have forgotten him. Murray was going to be the next big thing as the finest young footballer of his generation and the most gifted Geordie since Bobby Charlton. He played in the same Northumberland side as Alan Shearer when no one had heard of Shearer.</p> <p>Murray was the star, the hub of England Schoolboys' midfield. Just like Michael Owen a decade later, the world was at Murray's feet. And so were the offers from clubs desperate to sign him. So desperate that they offered deals that flouted all the rules. All that could be legitimately be offered in the mid-Eighties, when Murray was a schoolboy sensation, was a bog-standard two-year apprenticeship. He was offered more - much, much more. </p> <p>Last week BBC1 screened Football's Dream Factory about the current illicit candy on offer to today's generation of talented teenies. Murray could have written the script - a better script. Now, at 31, when contemporaries such as Shearer are facing the prospect of finishing in the game, the one-time wunderkind has just joined Conference club Kettering on loan from Notts County. </p> <p>On the face of it, his dream is all but over and a rude awakening perhaps all that remains. It was very different 16 years ago. At the time his father was on strike, a colliery worker in the North-East caught up in the middle of the bitter miners-versus-Thatcher strife of 1984-85. And certain clubs were throwing mouth-watering offers at the prodigy. Shades of Billy Elliott, but for London dance academies read Spurs followed keenly by Manchester United and Ipswich, to name but three.</p> <p>'I would have loved to have signed for Newcastle,' Murray told me at his detached home near Nottingham. 'But they weren't offering anything - only the absolute minimum two-year apprenticeship. I did listen to what Newcastle had to say. 'Jack Charlton was manager and he told me the way he liked to play - \"one-twos with God\" - and it was obvious I wasn't going to be going there. I had people coming up to me all the time with offers, not just scouts who I knew, but others who I'd never met. I left it all to my dad and tried to concentrate on the game.' </p> <p>Even after a decade and a half, literally a lifetime for a player, Murray is reluctant to be specific but he concedes that both United and Spurs made lucrative offers - and far beyond what was legitimate. Spurs courted him, had him down for weekends when he could train with the first team and play with the youth side. He was sold, almost literally, on White Hart Lane. 'Manchester United offered more', he says. 'but I went for Spurs.' There was talk on the football grapevine of \u00a3100,000 for signing which brings a shake of the head but not a complete denial. 'I didn't get that sort of money for signing at 16,' he says. 'It was all in the contract. I only had to be a YTS trainee for six months and then I'd be guaranteed a pro deal until I was 21 - five years. And there were signing-on fees if I stayed. I didn't have to sweat and worry about finishing a two-year apprenticeship at 18 and wonder whether or not I'd get offered full professional terms. It was all sorted out when I signed.' Any extra goodies? 'My dad got a car, which was very nice at the time,' he says. 'And I got a \"lumper\" - a brown envelope with a wad of cash inside.' And so that was that. England's finest schoolboy talent was on the road to still more fame and even bigger fortunes. Except that it never happened. </p> <p>Two years later and the kid they all wanted was knocking on manager Terry Venables' door. Not to find out if he'd get a pro contract - that was already set in stone - but to ask why he wasn't in a first-team squad. 'I saw other youngsters getting a chance but not me,' Murray says. 'I was upset. I thought, \"That should be me.\" I cringe to think of it now. These days youth players never speak to a manager, let alone demand to know why they're not in the first team. 'Part of it was that I was quite big for my age at 14 and 15. After that, I didn't grow much while my contemporaries kept on getting bigger. I don't think I suffered because I was in a comfort-zone of not having to battle for a pro deal with the other trainees. It's just that I was not so outstanding as I got older and the expected move into the first team didn't come.' The next call was from agent Eric Hall. He told Murray that Portsmouth were keen to sign him. 'I didn't know than that Eric Hall was a pal of Terry Venables,' he says. 'Nor did I know that Terry was big pals with Portsmouth chairman Jim Gregory. I agreed to sign but never the got the money I should have done from either end. I think I got stitched up a bit there.' </p> <p>And that was Murray's last real tilt at fame. He had never made Spurs first team yet the club pocketed a \u00a3100,000 fee from his sale in 1989 - perhaps recouping their investment. A successful spell at Pompey could have seen him shooting for the moon again, but it brought him only occasional first-team football and ultimately desperate heartache under manager Jim Smith, prompting him to consider 'packing in the game and heading back home to Newcastle'. Instead he was rescued in 1993 by league new boys Scarborough. He started enjoying his football again and when chairman Geoffrey Richmond went to Bradford, he took Murray with him. There he stayed for four years, helping them to Division One, before a move to Sam Allardyce's Notts County. The dreams of glory and big money, however, were long gone. </p> <p>'I was just earning a living,' Murray says. Now Allardyce is at Bolton and County have a different manager, Jocky Scott. He is the latest to question Murray's ability to impose himself on a game. So he now trains twice a week - the non-leaguer's staple - and plays in Kettering's shop window. 'I'm doing a favour to Carl Shutt, the manager who's a pal from my Bradford days. And he's doing me a favour,' is how Murray sees it. 'I think I can still do a job at a decent level and I want to play until I'm 35. Unlike the top players today, I can't afford not to work. I'll have to get some sort of job after I finish.' Murray's now building for that future with his wife, Julie, and sons Sam, five, and three-year-old Danny.</p> <p>How would he react if either boy showed promise as a player? 'I'd not mind them following me - but Julie's dead set against it,' he says. He is remarkably free of bitterness or envy. Does he have any regrets ? 'No, not really. I did my best. I don't think I've been a failure because you can be out of this game with one injury, can't you? I've had a good career and at 31 I'm still playing. It's just that my career hasn't matched some of the expectations when I was a very good young player. I remember my Mum saying when I was going to Spurs, \"You've made it, son.\" Even at 15 I tried to tell her that I hadn't. So many things can happen.' And money. </p> <p>Was he or his family seduced by the money on offer? And what advice would he give to today's kids being chased by scouts and agents? He considers. 'I think if the money is there, you have to take it. Advice other than that is hard but I'll tell you this, I took out four endowment plans pushed at me by an agent when I was 19. I wondered what the hell I was doing, but now they'll set me up with a nice little nest-egg. I'd tell kids today to do the same. 'I'd also tell youngsters to be level-headed. If you appear to have it all at 15, don't expect it to happen. You have to make it happen. As for money, you really do have to take it. The next game could be your last.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>The rumours and accusations three years ago, Italian football's doping scandal is now for real and no one knows where it is going to end. Drugs cases are already impacting on the title race. Tonight, third-placed Lazio take on city rivals and league leaders AS Roma in a crucial derby but they do so without their Portuguese international defender Fernando Couto, who was suspended on Friday, six days after a counter-analysis confirmed that he had tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone. Juventus's Dutch international midfielder Edgar Davids is waiting for the counter-analysis on his positive test - should it be positive he too will be suspended pending a ban. Davids and Couto can expect the same 16-month bans handed out to Perugia players Cristian Bucchi and Salvatore Monaco and would then miss the World Cup finals should their countries qualify.</p> <p>In total there are now eight players from Serie A and B who have tested positive for nandrolone this season and while all protest their innocence, reports suggest as many as 40 other post-match tests have been close to the limit. For the players the positive samples could be the result of anything, just not nandronlone. It has been argued that athletes can test positive for the steroid due to dehydration or by strenuous training and suggested that legal vitamin supplements could have been contaminated. Lazio captain Alessandro Nesta even claimed he is now 'afraid to drink a glass of water'. </p> <p>Gianmartino Benzi, professor of pharmacology at the University of Pavia, who has a 30-year involvement in the issue of doping and sport has has heard all the excuses before. 'This is the usual answer of course - \"it is a mistake\", \"it is not me\". But the use of steroids in football is probably exactly the same as it is in other sports,' he told The Observer . The sudden emergence of positive doping results in Italy may be explained absence of testing in the past argues Benzi. Although steroids were outlawed by the International Olympic Committee in 1975, Italian football did not begin effectively testing for them until 1999, leaving plenty of scope for abuse.</p> <p>Benzi is dismissive of the arguments that player's samples could be pushed over the limit by other factors than drugs, 'It is not a question of two milligrams or three milligrams. For me with Nandrolone it is a question of yes or no.'

      "bodyText": "The rumours and accusations three years ago, Italian football's doping scandal is now for real and no one knows where it is going to end. Drugs cases are already impacting on the title race. Tonight, third-placed Lazio take on city rivals and league leaders AS Roma in a crucial derby but they do so without their Portuguese international defender Fernando Couto, who was suspended on Friday, six days after a counter-analysis confirmed that he had tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone. Juventus's Dutch international midfielder Edgar Davids is waiting for the counter-analysis on his positive test - should it be positive he too will be suspended pending a ban. Davids and Couto can expect the same 16-month bans handed out to Perugia players Cristian Bucchi and Salvatore Monaco and would then miss the World Cup finals should their countries qualify. In total there are now eight players from Serie A and B who have tested positive for nandrolone this season and while all protest their innocence, reports suggest as many as 40 other post-match tests have been close to the limit. For the players the positive samples could be the result of anything, just not nandronlone. It has been argued that athletes can test positive for the steroid due to dehydration or by strenuous training and suggested that legal vitamin supplements could have been contaminated. Lazio captain Alessandro Nesta even claimed he is now 'afraid to drink a glass of water'. Gianmartino Benzi, professor of pharmacology at the University of Pavia, who has a 30-year involvement in the issue of doping and sport has has heard all the excuses before. 'This is the usual answer of course - \"it is a mistake\", \"it is not me\". But the use of steroids in football is probably exactly the same as it is in other sports,' he told The Observer . The sudden emergence of positive doping results in Italy may be explained absence of testing in the past argues Benzi. Although steroids were outlawed by the International Olympic Committee in 1975, Italian football did not begin effectively testing for them until 1999, leaving plenty of scope for abuse. Benzi is dismissive of the arguments that player's samples could be pushed over the limit by other factors than drugs, 'It is not a question of two milligrams or three milligrams. For me with Nandrolone it is a question of yes or no.'

Not until Walter Smith stressed the urgency of the situation and made a tactical reshuffle at half-time, did Everton inject a cutting edge into proceedings. Within a minute of the restart, Everton were level, after 62 minutes, they led. Ferguson finally converted one of the plethora of Everton chances when he placed Kevin Campbell's flick-on from Michael Ball's long throw through Gary Walsh's legs from six yards. The second goal, a clean left-foot Alexandersson strike from eight yards was the result of neat approach play and a cross from Scot Gemmill. Either side of that goal, Steve Watson conceded penalties, first for tripping Carbone, then for handling. In the 54th minute Robbie Blake's attempt was well saved by Paul Gerrard low to his right, 11 minutes later Carbone took over penalty responsibilities only to shoot high over the bar. 'It's been a difficult season for everybody,' said manager Walter Smith. 'I'm just glad we're not involved on the last couple of Saturdays.' So, too, one senses is Jim Jefferies.",

This is what you will do and how you will do it.\" If you split the jobs, each will say \"Such and such is a good fellow and he must be kept\".

'He has got to the position of three strikes and you are out,' said Manning. 'If he can't pull it off, he will have to exit stage left. That may put him in a compromising mood.' </p> <p>While jobs will inevitably go, neither side is presenting the deal as a cost-cutting option. Analysts are pencilling in relatively minor cost savings - Simon Samuels at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, for example, thinks that they could eventually reach \u00a3320m, or 11% of total costs, similar to that promised by Lloyds for Abbey but well below what BoS thought it could squeeze out of NatWest. He is more pessimistic on revenues, forecasting just an extra \u00a3250m - although others, such as James Alexander at Commerzbank, estimates a much more generous \u00a3900m. </p> <p>The leaking of the deal prompted the predictable round of speculation about rival bidders who might make it third time unlucky for Burt.

BoS and Halifax would surely argue that a takeover by Barclays was just an attempt to stop them creating one. </p> <p>The RBS is mooted as a bidder for Halifax after Fred Goodwin, its chief executive, expressed an interest in mortgage lenders at the bank's results presentation earlier this year.

Although less well-off people may not shed tears on your behalf, you do have a fair gripe. </p> <p>Many employees are considering taking out a stakeholder pension rather than making Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) through their company scheme. This is because when they come to retire, they can take a quarter of their stakeholder fund in the form of tax-free cash - but there is no tax-free cash from an AVC plan, which must be used to purchase an annuity. </p> <p>In fact, some people in this situation will still be able to take out a stakeholder. To do this, they need to have some self-employed income which will meet the Inland Revenue's definition of a trade under Schedule D. The Revenue confirms that even 'if the employee has Schedule D income of only \u00a31, they can make contributions up to the earnings threshold, of \u00a33,600 (less tax relief of 22 per cent)'. </p> <p>This fits in with the basic stakeholder design, which allows people with no earnings to set up a plan. </p> <p>The limitation for people in this situation is the earnings cap - currently \u00a395,400. This means that your total pension contributions would be limited to a certain percentage of your earnings up to this threshold. The percentage depends on your age and ranges between 17.5 and 40 per cent. </p> <p>Tom McPhail of independent financial adviser Torquil Clark thinks this route will prove useful to many senior managers who have the spare cash to make use of it. But he warns: 'Make sure you can reasonably enter your self-employed income on your tax return.' He suggests that even if Mrs Bloggs picks strawberries one day and her husband cleans the neighbour's car a couple of times, this could count for self-employed income. </p> <p>However, asked about this, the Revenue replied: 'Mrs Bloggs picking strawberries and Mr Bloggs washing cars twice a year would not amount to a trade. To be classified as a trader, a person must usually be involved in a series of transactions occurring in not-too-great intervals of time and showing habitual and continuous activity.' </p> <p>So, to avoid disputes, you may want to ensure that your strawberry picking is frequent and regular, your car- cleaning really is a business, or your freelance lecturing is a sustained activity. 'Documentary evidence is very useful - keep all your receipts and invoices,' says McPhail. </p> <p>Higher-rate taxpayers do particularly well out of the stakeholder. They will get 40 per cent relief on the maximum gross contribution in a year of \u00a33,600. Although they will have to claim some of the relief back through their tax return, a \u00a33,600 contribution will cost them just \u00a32,160. (This assumes, they have enough earnings to give them 40 per cent relief on all the \u00a33,600. Someone who is just above the 40 per cent threshold of \u00a333,935 will get 40 per cent relief on contributions above the threshold and 22 per cent below.) </p> <p>Ian Johnson, of accountant Grant Thornton, thinks this approach to the stakeholder pension is fine for a higher-rate taxpayer - but that basic-rate taxpayers who are already paying into an occupational scheme may not want to invest so much in pension planning. 'You may be better off putting the money into an Individual Savings Account because it is more accessible,' he says. </p> <p>The earliest that people can usually withdraw money from a pension plan is at 50, but money can be taken from Isas at any time.</p>",

Although they will have to claim some of the relief back through their tax return, a \u00a33,600 contribution will cost them just \u00a32,160. (This assumes, they have enough earnings to give them 40 per cent relief on all the \u00a33,600. Someone who is just above the 40 per cent threshold of \u00a333,935 will get 40 per cent relief on contributions above the threshold and 22 per cent below.) Ian Johnson, of accountant Grant Thornton, thinks this approach to the stakeholder pension is fine for a higher-rate taxpayer - but that basic-rate taxpayers who are already paying into an occupational scheme may not want to invest so much in pension planning. 'You may be better off putting the money into an Individual Savings Account because it is more accessible,' he says. The earliest that people can usually withdraw money from a pension plan is at 50, but money can be taken from Isas at any time.",

In some cases it may be at the root of real financial hardship. </p> <p>Relentless pleading by children for particular items is contributing to family debt problems, says Paul Millins, general manager of the National Debtline. 'Pester power is becoming one of the reasons that a household budget goes into the red. It is a particular issue for those on lower incomes because their children go to school and want the same clothes, games, computers and what-have-you as everyone else. The parents can't seem to say no to the request. So they fulfil them, even though they don't really have the means to do so.' </p> <p>But this pressure is not the preserve of the poor. Millins points out that even parents with higher incomes are putting costly kids' products on to their credit cards only to find, later on, that they can't always meet the repayments. </p> <p>Eileen Jones, founder of the charity PositiveParenting.org, says that regardless of class, 'the commercial focus on children has led some people into money troubles'. </p> <p>Rebecca Thomas, a trained social worker and mother of three, agrees. She takes a 'firm but fair' approach to her children, telling them 'very clearly' what they can and can't have and coming up with a compromise where appropriate. But she admits: 'It can still be very difficult to simply say, \"No, we can't afford that\". </p> <p>'Children are no longer content with just teddies or dolls or footballs. Now they not only want more, they want more expensive things, and those things have got to be the \"right\" brand.' </p> <p>Psychologists and retailers agree that children's demands depend on several factors, not least their age. The accepted wisdom is that the older they get, the more expensive they become. </p> <p>Jamie, a 12-year-old from Wales, has a personal wish list of kit worth several hundreds of pounds. It includes a colour Game Boy, a DVD player, Play Station 2, all the Pok\u00e9mon cards, the James Bond Thunderball and tickets to see Liverpool play Manchester United. </p> <p>But haven't children always wanted particular things and done their best to get them? Is pester power really new? Yes, says the 18-month-old National Family and Parenting Institute, which claims that the pressure for purchase has become greater. </p> <p>It is perhaps no coincidence that a conference called Kids 2001 will be held next month aimed at companies keen to capitalise on what has become known as the 'playground market'. </p> <p>The value of this is impossible to estimate, according to Peter Lancaster, joint managing director of the youth market consultancy Teenzworld. 'It runs into billions and billions of pounds. It is astronomical.' And, he says, it's going to get bigger. </p> <p>Marketing professionals admit they have only recently started to milk its potential. Nic Jones, who has long worked with leading international children's brands, says: 'Five or 10 years ago if a company had a kids' product in their portfolio they wouldn't really take it seriously. Now they take it very, very seriously.' </p> <p>This summer, Jones will launch his own brand. <a href=\"http://www.Pesterpower.com\">Pesterpower.com</a> will invite children aged between seven and 12 to fill out their own wish list, which will be sent off to their parents. This is one of several sites being launched directly at children's spending behaviour. </p> <p>As for teenagers, there is <a href=\"http://www.Teenfront.com\">Teenfront.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.Worldpop.com\">Worldpop.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.Gameplay.com\">Gameplay.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Mykindaplace.com\">Mykindaplace.com</a> - most featuring big name sponsorship. Shopping on these sites is becoming easier for young people with the introduction of payment systems that don't require a credit card. </p> <p>On <a href=\"http://www.Uksmart.co.uk\">Uksmart.co.uk</a>, for example, visitors pay with a type of token available from Post Offices. They simply quote the number on the token and away they go. As the site's splash page declares: 'Age is no barrier'. </p> <p>But all this is about 'empowering children', not harassing parents, says Nic Jones. He insists that websites like his are 'a way of children expressing their identity and their own opinion. It gives them a voice.' </p> <p>Others may disagree, but to date it is not the web that is the main focus of parental ire, but TV advertisements. 'They are pernicious,' says Mike Jempson, director of the media ethics charity PressWise. 'Their message is, \"If you haven't got this product, you are abnormal\". This is designed to get kids to pressurise their peers and parents.' </p> <p>Not so, insists Adrian Furnham, professor of psychology at University College, London. He analysed 20 international studies of children as consumers and has published a report called 'Children and Advertising: the allegations and the evidence'. In it he concludes that the cause of pester-power is not advertising but 'irresponsible parenting'. </p> <p>Furnham says what is needed to combat it is an 'authoritarian' approach, where rules are established, expectations are managed and decisions are explained, all with the child's point of view kept in mind. </p> <p>Mother of four Sue Jupp, aspires to this and claims to get it right most of the time. 'It is very easy to respond to a child's immediate request, especially when you know they want it so they can fit in with everyone else, but you just have to set boundaries,' she says. </p> <p>'If there is something they are particularly keen on, they have to work towards it, doing extra jobs around the house to earn the extra money to pay for it.' </p> <p>Rebecca Thomas thinks that doing anything else sets a bad example, especially in households where money is tight. </p> <p>Thomas says: 'Kids need to learn the value of things. If they just get whatever they want whenever they want, even if it means mum and dad are going into debt to pay for it, then what are we teaching them about money management?' Some might ask what are the parents teaching themselves? </p> <p>So how do you fight pester power? Best-selling author Elizabeth Hartley Brewer offers these tips: </p> <p> \u0095 Give regular pocket money, and stick to the limit. This encourages children to learn a sense of value. </p> <p> \u0095 Show them how to collect their 'wants' over two or three weeks, so they can prioritise them. </p> <p> \u0095 Put the waiting back. It's amazing how the 'must have now' soon fades in urgency. </p> <p> \u0095 Ask for a contribution towards the cost of expensive items. </p> <p> \u0095 Wherever possible, buy online, so your children can't be seduced by displays. </p> <p> \u0095 When you go shopping, be very clear what it is for. This makes it easier to stay firm. </p> <p> \u0095 If you decide to buy something, don't do it to assuage guilt: love shouldn't be measured by price tags. </p> <p> \u0095 Don't be frightened to say no. Children can learn that family and real friends don't judge by possessions. It is who they are inside that matters. </p> <p> Elizabeth Hartley Brewer has written 'Positive Parenting', 'Self-Esteem for Boys,' and, 'Self-Esteem for Girls'.</p>",

It includes a colour Game Boy, a DVD player, Play Station 2, all the Pok\u00e9mon cards, the James Bond Thunderball and tickets to see Liverpool play Manchester United. But haven't children always wanted particular things and done their best to get them? Is pester power really new? Yes, says the 18-month-old National Family and Parenting Institute, which claims that the pressure for purchase has become greater. It is perhaps no coincidence that a conference called Kids 2001 will be held next month aimed at companies keen to capitalise on what has become known as the 'playground market'. The value of this is impossible to estimate, according to Peter Lancaster, joint managing director of the youth market consultancy Teenzworld. 'It runs into billions and billions of pounds. It is astronomical.' And, he says, it's going to get bigger. Marketing professionals admit they have only recently started to milk its potential. Nic Jones, who has long worked with leading international children's brands, says: 'Five or 10 years ago if a company had a kids' product in their portfolio they wouldn't really take it seriously. Now they take it very, very seriously.' This summer, Jones will launch his own brand. Pesterpower.com will invite children aged between seven and 12 to fill out their own wish list, which will be sent off to their parents. This is one of several sites being launched directly at children's spending behaviour. As for teenagers, there is Teenfront.com, Worldpop.com, Gameplay.com and Mykindaplace.com - most featuring big name sponsorship. Shopping on these sites is becoming easier for young people with the introduction of payment systems that don't require a credit card. On Uksmart.co.uk, for example, visitors pay with a type of token available from Post Offices. They simply quote the number on the token and away they go. As the site's splash page declares: 'Age is no barrier'. But all this is about 'empowering children', not harassing parents, says Nic Jones. He insists that websites like his are 'a way of children expressing their identity and their own opinion. It gives them a voice.' Others may disagree, but to date it is not the web that is the main focus of parental ire, but TV advertisements. 'They are pernicious,' says Mike Jempson, director of the media ethics charity PressWise. 'Their message is, \"If you haven't got this product, you are abnormal\". This is designed to get kids to pressurise their peers and parents.' Not so, insists Adrian Furnham, professor of psychology at University College, London. He analysed 20 international studies of children as consumers and has published a report called 'Children and Advertising: the allegations and the evidence'. In it he concludes that the cause of pester-power is not advertising but 'irresponsible parenting'. Furnham says what is needed to combat it is an 'authoritarian' approach, where rules are established, expectations are managed and decisions are explained, all with the child's point of view kept in mind. Mother of four Sue Jupp, aspires to this and claims to get it right most of the time. 'It is very easy to respond to a child's immediate request, especially when you know they want it so they can fit in with everyone else, but you just have to set boundaries,' she says. 'If there is something they are particularly keen on, they have to work towards it, doing extra jobs around the house to earn the extra money to pay for it.' Rebecca Thomas thinks that doing anything else sets a bad example, especially in households where money is tight. Thomas says: 'Kids need to learn the value of things. If they just get whatever they want whenever they want, even if it means mum and dad are going into debt to pay for it, then what are we teaching them about money management?' Some might ask what are the parents teaching themselves? So how do you fight pester power? Best-selling author Elizabeth Hartley Brewer offers these tips: \u0095 Give regular pocket money, and stick to the limit. This encourages children to learn a sense of value. \u0095 Show them how to collect their 'wants' over two or three weeks, so they can prioritise them. \u0095 Put the waiting back. It's amazing how the 'must have now' soon fades in urgency. \u0095 Ask for a contribution towards the cost of expensive items. \u0095 Wherever possible, buy online, so your children can't be seduced by displays. \u0095 When you go shopping, be very clear what it is for. This makes it easier to stay firm. \u0095 If you decide to buy something, don't do it to assuage guilt: love shouldn't be measured by price tags. \u0095 Don't be frightened to say no. Children can learn that family and real friends don't judge by possessions. It is who they are inside that matters. Elizabeth Hartley Brewer has written 'Positive Parenting', 'Self-Esteem for Boys,' and, 'Self-Esteem for Girls'.",

Boothby was involved in the thriving literary community of Lichfield in Staffordshire, the birthplace of Samuel Johnson.

Boothby's relaxation is an act of intimacy with the viewer. He has nothing to hide or hold back. He is as pure as a rustic stream, not in society but in nature that is, he rejects the formal and indirect relationships of cultivated modern life in favour of a direct and authentic act of communion, as if this were the Golden Age and we were all shepherds together. As if his pose did not make this plain enough, in an untamed woodland with open country and the glowing sky behind him, he holds a work by Rousseau, whose arguments for simple living and a return to nature shook 18th-century Europe and were holy writ for the French Revolution. </p> <p>People read a lot in 18th-century art. Reading is an image of introspection, and Rousseau was a man dedicated to promoting feeling and sensitivity through books. The edition of Rousseau on which Boothby rests his gloved hand - presumably the book he himself published - is a sensual object, bound in calf skin, a book not of hard facts but tender emotions. Through this book we are invited to see the landscape itself as loving and meaningful, a place to dream and escape the shallow world of the city. </p> <p>Yet if Brooke Boothby is an early Romantic, he is not any kind of savage, noble or otherwise. He is a gentleman, fashionably dressed in broad-brimmed hat, ruffled collar and elegant suit.

      "body": "<p>European airlines are expected to allow customers a 24-hour cooling-off period after booking flights, when they will be able to cancel without losing money. </p> <p>Though the move will apply only to flights booked direct, rather than through travel agents, it will allow consumers to hang on to a seat while they continue shopping around for a lower fare, increasing pressure on airlines to offer them the cheapest deal in the first place. </p> <p>It is part of a new voluntary code of practice, agreed by scheduled and charter carriers from 38 countries, which is due to be unveiled early next month at a meeting in Lisbon. It includes other advances for consumers, not least a promise to respond to complaints within 28 days. But in other respects it threatens to be a damp squib, watered down by airlines terrified of committing themselves too far. </p> <p>And while major UK airlines have said they will comply with it as soon as it is generally agreed, some others may choose not to implement parts of it - or simply ignore it altogether. </p> <p>For example, while it looks likely that airlines will agree to offer the lowest available fare, they will continue to insist that they cannot do so unless travellers first provide them with a proposed departure date. Simon Evans, industrial affairs adviser for the British watchdog Air Transport Users Council, says: \"We would much rather they promised to come up with their best offer over a period of weeks, say, for passengers who are flexible, and just want to travel when they can get the cheapest deal.\" </p> <p>Passengers whose luggage goes astray will be promised that it will be delivered to them within 24 hours of the bags' arrival at their final destination, though in practice this usually happens already, and efforts will be made to speed up refunds for unused tickets, so people using credit cards will get their money back within seven days and those paying by cheque or in cash will have to wait no more than 20 days. </p> <p>The airlines are believed to have agreed to seek travellers who are prepared to give up their seats voluntarily on overbooked flights and travel later, rather than just bumping passengers. Some do this already. But, while it seems unlikely that anyone would volunteer unless there was something in it for them, there appears to be no commitment to pay compensation. </p> <p>And although airlines will agree to provide \"appropriate assistance\" for passengers delayed at airports for more than two hours, which means handing out refreshment or meal vouchers, this clause in the code also includes a get out - they will do so only if local conditions allow. </p> <p>The code is based broadly on the one launched just over a year ago by the US airlines in an attempt by to head off a government crackdown on service standards.

      "bodyText": "European airlines are expected to allow customers a 24-hour cooling-off period after booking flights, when they will be able to cancel without losing money. Though the move will apply only to flights booked direct, rather than through travel agents, it will allow consumers to hang on to a seat while they continue shopping around for a lower fare, increasing pressure on airlines to offer them the cheapest deal in the first place. It is part of a new voluntary code of practice, agreed by scheduled and charter carriers from 38 countries, which is due to be unveiled early next month at a meeting in Lisbon. It includes other advances for consumers, not least a promise to respond to complaints within 28 days. But in other respects it threatens to be a damp squib, watered down by airlines terrified of committing themselves too far. And while major UK airlines have said they will comply with it as soon as it is generally agreed, some others may choose not to implement parts of it - or simply ignore it altogether. For example, while it looks likely that airlines will agree to offer the lowest available fare, they will continue to insist that they cannot do so unless travellers first provide them with a proposed departure date. Simon Evans, industrial affairs adviser for the British watchdog Air Transport Users Council, says: \"We would much rather they promised to come up with their best offer over a period of weeks, say, for passengers who are flexible, and just want to travel when they can get the cheapest deal.\" Passengers whose luggage goes astray will be promised that it will be delivered to them within 24 hours of the bags' arrival at their final destination, though in practice this usually happens already, and efforts will be made to speed up refunds for unused tickets, so people using credit cards will get their money back within seven days and those paying by cheque or in cash will have to wait no more than 20 days. The airlines are believed to have agreed to seek travellers who are prepared to give up their seats voluntarily on overbooked flights and travel later, rather than just bumping passengers. Some do this already. But, while it seems unlikely that anyone would volunteer unless there was something in it for them, there appears to be no commitment to pay compensation. And although airlines will agree to provide \"appropriate assistance\" for passengers delayed at airports for more than two hours, which means handing out refreshment or meal vouchers, this clause in the code also includes a get out - they will do so only if local conditions allow. The code is based broadly on the one launched just over a year ago by the US airlines in an attempt by to head off a government crackdown on service standards. While it represents a leap forward for air passengers who, until recently, enjoyed remarkably few consumer rights, the American experience does not give grounds for huge optimism. Reports suggest most consumers there feel that airlines have yet to live up to their promises. However, the new code is not the only improvement promised for air travellers. Following pressure from the Office of Fair Trading, the International Air Transport Association, which represents most of the world's leading carriers, has agreed to recommend its members change their conditions of carriage. Previously, passengers with advance purchase or other non-refundable tickets who were prevented from flying by unavoidable circumstances would have lost their money. Now they will be able to get a voucher which they, or someone else, can trade in for a future flight. Even this conces sion comes with a caveat, however. The agreement speaks of \"force majeure\", which normally means events that are not covered by travel insurance. Will airlines cough up if passengers cancel for reasons that could have been insured against? The OFT says there is nothing in the deal to suggest they won't. Other observers are not so convinced.",

      "body": "<p>While Southern Europe is unlikely ever to lose its holiday appeal, a sophisticated crowd are increasingly heading north, attracted by good design, jaw-dropping scenery, a friendly atmosphere and a distinctly positive attitude to partying. </p> <p>Reykjavik has won a well-deserved reputation for its funky bars, clubs and other-worldly feel. Yet it is only one of a number of cities booming with new-found confidence. There, exuberant, well- educated and youthful populations enjoy life amid excellent design and architecture and, during the summer, almost endless sunny days. Here is our list of the five brightest northern stars. </p> <p><strong>St Petersburg</strong></p> <p> After the 1917 revolution, Peter the Great's baroque capital was relegated to a provincial city, but with the collapse of the Soviet Union, it began to claw back its status and now easily rivals Moscow in terms of cultural appeal. There's a great summer performing arts festival - the Harms Festival - as well as Russia's wildest and most innovative live music/club scene. </p> <p> <strong> What to see: </strong> The Hermitage, housed in the sumptuous Winter Palace, is one of the world's great art collections and must not be missed. You should also take a boat cruise down the Neva. </p> <p> <strong> Where to eat: </strong> The popular Durak - the Idiot - provides authentic gloomy 19th- century Russian decor that conjures up Dostoevsky's time and serves excellent borscht, rustic rye bread and chilled vodka. Kavkaz offers Georgian cuisine. </p> <p> <strong> Nightlife: </strong> Many of the more interesting nightspots spring up and then close rapidly. Look in Friday's English- language St Petersburg Times for up-to-date listings. Long-standing favourites include Griboedov, housed in a bomb shelter and one of the coolest places around, and Manhattan for smooth, intellectual jazz. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay: </strong> In order to get a visa, you must have a hotel booking. All-inclusive package deals offer the best value - try Russia House on 020-7407 3558. Otherwise try the luxurious Hotel Astoria (+7 312 2105757) in the city centre. \u00a3150+.</p> <p><strong>Helsinki</strong></p> <p> In summer, the city is a joyful mix of parks, open-air bars/ caf\u00e9s, public art, great architecture and almost endless sunshine. And, at any time of year, you'll be greeted by one of the hardest drinking and partying cities in Europe,. </p> <p>The Russian influence still looms large, particularly in the area around the cathedral at Senate Square, a pretty neoclassical quarter modelled on St Petersburg. However, most of Helsinki's architecture is thoroughly modern. The Finns have a real appreciation of design and form, which has led to some of the north's sleekest new buildings from Alvar Aalto's sweeping curves of Finlandia Hall and the post-modern Kiasma. </p> <p> <strong> What to see: </strong> The exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art at Kiamsa are a bit hit-and-miss, but the building is fantastic. Also take a day-trip to Suomenlinna, an odd inhabited island fortress. </p> <p> <strong> Where to eat: </strong> Try fantastic - and expensive - Russian cuisine at Bellevue, behind the Orthodox Uspenski Cathedral. The Lapp restaurant serves saut\u00e9ed reindeer. </p> <p> <strong> Nightlife: </strong> Moskva bar has great retro-Soviet chic, Saunabar mixes essential sounds with steamy saunas, and Tori spins chilled-out jazz-funk and serves great food. For serious drinking, head to Corona or, for legendary tango dancing, Vahna Maestro. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay: </strong> The new swish Scandic Hotel Simonkentta (+385 9 68380) is perfectly positioned, and some rooms even have their own sauna. \u00a360-\u00a3200. </p> <p><strong>Aarhus</strong> </p> <p> The Danish second city has a massive student population giving the place a zesty and friendly atmosphere along with the country's most vibrant live-music scene - many of Denmark's top acts originate here. </p> <p>The compact city centre has recently undergone massive renovation, and the bustling waterfront area, Vadestedet, is full of bars, restaurants and caf\u00e9s spilling out into the long summer nights. The Latin Quarter has a string of designer outlets, including Munthe + Simonsen - Helena Christensen's favourite - and one of Denmark's few boutique hotels. And, if you just want to get some fresh air, nearby blue-flag beaches, parks and woodlands provide a great counterpoint. </p> <p> <strong> What to see: </strong> The Art Museum houses a fine collection of Danish art, including Asger Jorn's dramatic abstracts. Den Gamle By is a collection of medieval housing from around the country turned into a living museum. </p> <p> <strong> Where to eat : </strong> Emmerys provides great organic cakes, coffee etc in a simple Scandinavian atmosphere. Poeme offers excellent fusion food. </p> <p> <strong> Nightlife: </strong> Voxhall hosts the underground live acts, while Casablanca is for a more refined and chilled crowd. Head for Vadestedet for bar crawling. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay: </strong> Guldsmeden (+45 8613 4550) is a friendly boutique hotel right in the city centre. The rooms are simple and elegant. Some have four-poster beds. \u00a360plus. </p> <p><strong>Oslo</strong> </p> <p> For hundreds of years, Oslo - or Christiania as it used to be known - was a far-flung outpost of the Swedish and Danish empires. Since independence at the start of the 20th century, it has struggled to shake off its provincial chains and finally become the sophisticated capital of one of the world's richest and best-educated countries. </p> <p>Like most northern cities, Oslo comes alive during the summer months. A stroll down the main thoroughfare, Karl Johans Gate, reveals a bustling city filled with caf\u00e9s and street performers while statues of figures such as Ibsen remind you of the depth of Norwegian culture. Drifting past the twin modernist brick towers of the R dhus - city hall - leads to Aker Brygge, a collection of excellent waterfront bars, restaurants and caf\u00e9s. Nearby, you can take a ferry to the numerous wooded islands scattered around Oslofjord. </p> <p>Oslo's nightlife doesn't really get going until about 11pm, but when it does it's a serious party town with many bars staying open till 4am. The Norwegians are a hospitable bunch who generally speak perfect English, and with virtually no crime this has to be one of Europe's most user-friendly capitals. </p> <p> <strong> What to see: </strong> The open-air sculpture park devoted to the work of Gustav Vigeland and the Munch Museum are must-sees, while the ski jump/ museum and surrounding woodlands of Holmenkollen make for a good day-trip. </p> <p> <strong> Where to eat:</strong> Det Norske Hus serves excellent reindeer and salted cod, while the groovier Sjakk Matt offers inexpensive Mediterranean-inspired grub. </p> <p> <strong> Nightlife: </strong> Jazid focuses on bigbeat, jungle and underground techno, while Head On serves up smoother soul and hip-hop. For a beery night in fashionable surroundings, try Barbeint or the Beer Palace. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay: </strong> Noble House Hotel (+47 23 10 72 00), cool modernist decor and a fantastic central position. \u00a380+. </p> <p><strong>Riga</strong></p> <p> With a population approaching one million, the Latvian capital is the Baltic's biggest and most cosmopolitan city. Celebrating its 800th birthday this year, it was a wealthy trading post between the West and Russia before being occupied by the Nazis and then the Soviet Union. It regained its independence in 1991 and is once again rebuilding ties with the West. </p> <p>The nightlife provides plenty of options from the coolest clubs to the downright sleazy. If you just want a romantic evening stroll, head for Bastejkalns park and the surrounding boulevards. Just outside the western fringes of the city, there's a string of beach resorts backed by pine forests. There, you'll also find some hedonistic nightclubs, outdoor bars and more examples of well-preserved early modern architecture. </p> <p> <strong> What to see: </strong> Just behind the bus station, the covered market housed in five old Zeppelin hangars is a phenomenal sight. The 12th-century cathedral is worth a visit and also houses a history museum. </p> <p> <strong> Where to eat: </strong> Staburags provides a feast of Latvian cuisine in a labyrinth of oak-furnished rooms. Nostalgija serves Russian food amid pure retro-Soviet chic. </p> <p> <strong> Nightlife: </strong> DECO has great furniture and cocktails, Aligators trades on tacky Americana and rock'n'roll while Groks Stacija plies techno in a strange underground station set. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay: </strong> Konventa Seta (+371/7087501) is set in a complex of nine medieval buildings equipped with all mod cons. \u00a345.</p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's world</strong></p> <p><a href=\" http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/countries/story/0,7451,479478,00.html\">Walking on sunshine</a><br> Author Chris Stewart kicks off our Tomorrow's World special with a hike through some of Europe's most spectacular country - in southern Spain</p> <p><a href=\" http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/countries/story/0,7451,479548,00.html\">Basque it</a><br> The glitterati head for nearby Biarritz.

      "body": "<p>I came to Hawaii because I couldn't write any more; within a year I had a new life. I was sitting in the bar of an 80-room rat-nibbled hotel at the seedy end of Waikiki chatting to the owner, Buddy Hamstra. </p> <p>\"What would you call the bar?\" he asked. </p> <p>\"Paradise Lost,\" I quipped. </p> <p>\"I like that,\" he returned. \"Howdya like to be resident manager?\" </p> <p>I kept Room 409 empty, because the sounds of raucous sex coming from above kinda got me in the mood. It did the same for Sweetie, the 27-year-old daughter of local Whyan good-time girl Puamana. Our afternoon lovemaking graduated to a marriage, and a child - the precocious Rose. Strange thing, though. It turned out the guy in Room 509 wasn't fucking; he was carving his coffin. </p> <p>The hotel was crammed with losers, hustlers and hookers. Madam Ma, the island's gossip columnist, used to drink there. In between sightings of Jack Lord, she was never that nice to Rose. Changed her tune when her son, Chip, murdered his gay lover when he found him raping his mom. Only it wasn't rape as Madam Ma was having a scene with her son's lover behind his back. Kinda nice Whyan symmetry. </p> <p>Buddy was getting lonely. \"I need another wife,\" he said, before flying to Manila to get Pinky. On his return he went missing presumed drowned, and we all gathered in his lawyer's office. \"Hi,\" he grinned, \"I'm back.\" Buddy sure kept Pinky on her toes. </p> <p>The locals used to mock my reading. Except one. Leon Udel was Henry James's biographer.

      "bodyText": "I came to Hawaii because I couldn't write any more; within a year I had a new life. I was sitting in the bar of an 80-room rat-nibbled hotel at the seedy end of Waikiki chatting to the owner, Buddy Hamstra. \"What would you call the bar?\" he asked. \"Paradise Lost,\" I quipped. \"I like that,\" he returned. \"Howdya like to be resident manager?\" I kept Room 409 empty, because the sounds of raucous sex coming from above kinda got me in the mood. It did the same for Sweetie, the 27-year-old daughter of local Whyan good-time girl Puamana. Our afternoon lovemaking graduated to a marriage, and a child - the precocious Rose. Strange thing, though. It turned out the guy in Room 509 wasn't fucking; he was carving his coffin. The hotel was crammed with losers, hustlers and hookers. Madam Ma, the island's gossip columnist, used to drink there. In between sightings of Jack Lord, she was never that nice to Rose. Changed her tune when her son, Chip, murdered his gay lover when he found him raping his mom. Only it wasn't rape as Madam Ma was having a scene with her son's lover behind his back. Kinda nice Whyan symmetry. Buddy was getting lonely. \"I need another wife,\" he said, before flying to Manila to get Pinky. On his return he went missing presumed drowned, and we all gathered in his lawyer's office. \"Hi,\" he grinned, \"I'm back.\" Buddy sure kept Pinky on her toes. The locals used to mock my reading. Except one. Leon Udel was Henry James's biographer. He knew who I was and I knew who he was. \"I feel like Rimbaud,\" I moaned. \"Know how you feel,\" he replied. \"You should try writing some short stories.\" I began to hear voices. \"You're a failure.\" \"Just another middle-aged howlie who married a local.\" \"What's it matter if they're real or not?\" argued Sweetie. \"It's the truth.\" \"Keep on going,\" said Udel. \"Deep down, you're a genius.\" Buddy had an experimental op to help his breathing, but couldn't quit the vodka and cigars.

      "body": "<p>When I was a child, I used to visit Vilnius a lot in my imagination. Other kids were probably transported to more exotic locations, but I was always drawn to the birthplace of my father. In reality, it took me 39 years to get there. And when I did go, it wasn't on a mission to discover my roots. I simply went to satisfy my curiosity. </p> <p>The things I knew about the place could be written on the back of a postcard in a child's handwriting. I knew that it was sometimes cold enough for your spit to freeze before it hit the ground; that people fished for eels through holes they cut in the ice; and that they kept warm by eating livid-looking bowls of soup made out of beetroots. In summer, though, it was hot enough for the soup to be served cold. </p> <p>Listening to my father's stories as I grew up, it never occurred to me that Vilnius could be a city, let alone the capital of Lithuania. I knew it better as Wilno, a Polish town since 1920, the place where my dad was born in 1932 and where he lived for the first few years of his life until my grandparents were evicted from their smallholding by Red Army soldiers in the early 1940s. Wilno then became Vilna, it was swallowed up by the Soviet Union and any discussion beyond that point would see my father's eyebrows descending as heavily as the Iron Curtain. </p> <p>It certainly never occurred to me that it might be somewhere I would one day consider going for a weekend break. It's not an obvious contender, after all. And it came as a bit of a shock to discover that it was not, as I had imagined, a grey Soviet city jerry-built on top of someone else's ruins. Here instead was a bright, clean and colourfully-restored old town with cobbled streets and a castle perched on top of a hill, a Unesco World Heritage site separated by a river from the utilitarian tower blocks of the new town. </p> <p>Many of the buildings have been painted pink and blue and green and yellow, and the atmosphere is much lighter and warmer than you could reasonably expect for a place that only gained its independence 10 years ago and that saw the last Soviet troops leave as recently as 1993. </p> <p>You will be hard-pressed to hear another English accent in Vilnius. The occasional American drawl from a member of the returning diaspora maybe - the Lithuanian president, Valdas Adamkus, counts himself among their ranks. But unlike Prague, say, Vilnius is not yet overrun with tourists. As a result, there's a genuine feeling of discovery when you walk around recently-restored buildings in the miraculously-preserved old town. </p> <p>In the central market, Belorussians with faces the shape and colour of beetroots sit by their meagre piles of potatoes or carrots. And 20 minutes' drive out of Vilnius, I did see men fishing on a frozen lake, looking like garden gnomes, with the magnificent castle of Trakai towering behind them. Further on, a haystack came wobbling up the opposite side of the road towards us - the driver perched on top of the load and linked to the carthorse by two impossibly long reins. In Lithuania, the echoes of the past are never too far away. </p> <p>It's like lifting the lid on a box of treasure that has been forgotten about for more than half a century. You can still find churches that would have been \"exploded\" by Stalin and his henchmen had the Lithuanians not been quick to turn them into museums. The stunning neoclassical cathedral was an art gallery for 32 years, but also had $10 million worth of religious artefacts hidden from the Soviets within its walls; and the baroque Church of St Casimir survived, ironically, as the museum of atheism. In all, 21 churches escaped Stalin's purges, including a gothic masterpiece, the Church of St Anne's. When Napoleon saw St Anne's, as he marched towards Russia, he was so impressed he said he wanted to take back to France in the palm of his hand. </p> <p>The three saints on the roof of the cathedral did not, however, survive Soviet destruction and were only replaced in 1996 after a 46-year absence. Now they look over the stebuklas (miracle) tile, the spot between the cathedral and the bell tower from where in 1989 a human chain of two million Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians stretched over 650km to Tallinn to protest against Soviet rule. People now come to make a wish on the square at which the miracle of freedom was born. </p> <p>The novelty of this freedom perhaps explains why the streets can still be spookily deserted at night. But you'll find the bars and basement clubs busy until the small hours pumping out danceable music and serving drinks at prices that won't stop you in your tracks: around \u00a31 for a pint of local lager and \u00a31.50 for a cocktail. </p> <p>Or, if you're feeling more sophisticated, you can secure the best seats at the opera for around \u00a36, and follow it with a traditional Lithuanian meal for two with wine at Zemaiciu Smukle for around \u00a320. For this, you can get a bowl of delicious beetroot soup, and a mixed grill of beef fillet, pork ribs, salmon, baked potatoes and courgettes plus a bottle of very drinkable Chilean red. </p> <p>Odd then that we should choose to spend an evening drinking Russian \"champagne\" at 60 pence a glass served by waitresses dressed in Russian sailor outfits in a bar decked out with Lenin memorabilia. You'd think it would leave a bad taste in the mouth, but the style of Naktinis Vilkas (The Iron Wolf) is intentionally kitsch, almost mocking. </p> <p> The following morning, though, sobriety returns in the form of the KGB Museum or, to give it its proper title, the Museum of Genocide Victims, which is around the corner from the bar. Here you can rent an audiophone and tour the cells where, between 1958 and 1987, thousands of Lithuanians were detained, interrogated, tortured and executed. Many who entered this building were subsequently deported to the gulags in Siberia. </p> <p>It is a relief to be back on the main street of Gedimino again. We fortify ourselves with coffee and cake in a caf\u00e9 opposite the square over which a giant statue of Lenin presided, but which was ceremonially removed by crane in 1991 when the Soviets finally gave up the ghost of trying to impose their will on the people. Now the 20ft tall icon - minus the thumb on his outstretched hand - has come to rest in the Soviet Sculpture Memorial Park two hours south-west of Vilnius in the town of Grutas. </p> <p>More than 60 statues and busts of former Soviet despots are on display in a place that is being billed as Stalin World, a theme park said to recreate the atmos phere of the gulags, with a cattle truck at the entrance, guard towers overlooking the statues and patriotic songs playing over loudspeakers. </p> <p>The park is owned by Viliumas Malinauskas, who bought all the statues and busts that were junked across Lithuania after independence. It officially opened on April 1, costs \u00a31 to enter and there's a caf\u00e9, a children's play area and even a little zoo. But this is no theme park. Instead, you will find an extraordinary collection of ideological sculptures presented with thoughtful biographies. There's also an excellent information centre stocked with badges, busts, portraits and pamphlets from the Soviet era. The only bizarre sight is seeing Lithuanians draping themselves over these symbols of repression to have their photographs taken. </p> <p>On my final morning, I visit Adakris Marcinkus at his apartment set in a cobbled square in the old town. A former film director now in his seventies, Adakris offers B&amp;B to tourists in his home. They come mostly from the US, Sweden and Norway, and he tells me how pleasant it is just to be able to hear different languages being spoken again after so many years of listening purely to Lithuanian and Russian. His eyes light up when he describes the restoration of colours to buildings that had long lain under a thick layer of Soviet grime. </p> <p>Adakris could only be a few years older than my father. His earliest memories would be of a similar place. And, although I had not come looking for the land of my father, it felt almost as though I had stumbled across it sipping coffee and listening to the stories of this elderly gentleman in his apartment off a cobbled courtyard in the heart of old Vilnius.</p> <p><strong>Where to eat, drink and party in Vilnius</strong></p> <p><strong> Lunch</strong></p> <p><strong> Mano Kavine </strong><br> Boksto 7 Ave.<br> Cost: \u00a33. </p> <p>Hidden away off the Town Hall Square, this fresh and funky caf\u008e offers the best salads in Vilnius.

And it came as a bit of a shock to discover that it was not, as I had imagined, a grey Soviet city jerry-built on top of someone else's ruins. Here instead was a bright, clean and colourfully-restored old town with cobbled streets and a castle perched on top of a hill, a Unesco World Heritage site separated by a river from the utilitarian tower blocks of the new town. Many of the buildings have been painted pink and blue and green and yellow, and the atmosphere is much lighter and warmer than you could reasonably expect for a place that only gained its independence 10 years ago and that saw the last Soviet troops leave as recently as 1993. You will be hard-pressed to hear another English accent in Vilnius. The occasional American drawl from a member of the returning diaspora maybe - the Lithuanian president, Valdas Adamkus, counts himself among their ranks. But unlike Prague, say, Vilnius is not yet overrun with tourists. As a result, there's a genuine feeling of discovery when you walk around recently-restored buildings in the miraculously-preserved old town. In the central market, Belorussians with faces the shape and colour of beetroots sit by their meagre piles of potatoes or carrots. And 20 minutes' drive out of Vilnius, I did see men fishing on a frozen lake, looking like garden gnomes, with the magnificent castle of Trakai towering behind them. Further on, a haystack came wobbling up the opposite side of the road towards us - the driver perched on top of the load and linked to the carthorse by two impossibly long reins. In Lithuania, the echoes of the past are never too far away. It's like lifting the lid on a box of treasure that has been forgotten about for more than half a century. You can still find churches that would have been \"exploded\" by Stalin and his henchmen had the Lithuanians not been quick to turn them into museums. The stunning neoclassical cathedral was an art gallery for 32 years, but also had $10 million worth of religious artefacts hidden from the Soviets within its walls; and the baroque Church of St Casimir survived, ironically, as the museum of atheism. In all, 21 churches escaped Stalin's purges, including a gothic masterpiece, the Church of St Anne's. When Napoleon saw St Anne's, as he marched towards Russia, he was so impressed he said he wanted to take back to France in the palm of his hand. The three saints on the roof of the cathedral did not, however, survive Soviet destruction and were only replaced in 1996 after a 46-year absence. Now they look over the stebuklas (miracle) tile, the spot between the cathedral and the bell tower from where in 1989 a human chain of two million Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians stretched over 650km to Tallinn to protest against Soviet rule. People now come to make a wish on the square at which the miracle of freedom was born. The novelty of this freedom perhaps explains why the streets can still be spookily deserted at night. But you'll find the bars and basement clubs busy until the small hours pumping out danceable music and serving drinks at prices that won't stop you in your tracks: around \u00a31 for a pint of local lager and \u00a31.50 for a cocktail. Or, if you're feeling more sophisticated, you can secure the best seats at the opera for around \u00a36, and follow it with a traditional Lithuanian meal for two with wine at Zemaiciu Smukle for around \u00a320. For this, you can get a bowl of delicious beetroot soup, and a mixed grill of beef fillet, pork ribs, salmon, baked potatoes and courgettes plus a bottle of very drinkable Chilean red. Odd then that we should choose to spend an evening drinking Russian \"champagne\" at 60 pence a glass served by waitresses dressed in Russian sailor outfits in a bar decked out with Lenin memorabilia. You'd think it would leave a bad taste in the mouth, but the style of Naktinis Vilkas (The Iron Wolf) is intentionally kitsch, almost mocking. The following morning, though, sobriety returns in the form of the KGB Museum or, to give it its proper title, the Museum of Genocide Victims, which is around the corner from the bar. Here you can rent an audiophone and tour the cells where, between 1958 and 1987, thousands of Lithuanians were detained, interrogated, tortured and executed. Many who entered this building were subsequently deported to the gulags in Siberia. It is a relief to be back on the main street of Gedimino again. We fortify ourselves with coffee and cake in a caf\u00e9 opposite the square over which a giant statue of Lenin presided, but which was ceremonially removed by crane in 1991 when the Soviets finally gave up the ghost of trying to impose their will on the people. Now the 20ft tall icon - minus the thumb on his outstretched hand - has come to rest in the Soviet Sculpture Memorial Park two hours south-west of Vilnius in the town of Grutas. More than 60 statues and busts of former Soviet despots are on display in a place that is being billed as Stalin World, a theme park said to recreate the atmos phere of the gulags, with a cattle truck at the entrance, guard towers overlooking the statues and patriotic songs playing over loudspeakers. The park is owned by Viliumas Malinauskas, who bought all the statues and busts that were junked across Lithuania after independence. It officially opened on April 1, costs \u00a31 to enter and there's a caf\u00e9, a children's play area and even a little zoo. But this is no theme park. Instead, you will find an extraordinary collection of ideological sculptures presented with thoughtful biographies. There's also an excellent information centre stocked with badges, busts, portraits and pamphlets from the Soviet era. The only bizarre sight is seeing Lithuanians draping themselves over these symbols of repression to have their photographs taken. On my final morning, I visit Adakris Marcinkus at his apartment set in a cobbled square in the old town. A former film director now in his seventies, Adakris offers B&amp;B to tourists in his home. They come mostly from the US, Sweden and Norway, and he tells me how pleasant it is just to be able to hear different languages being spoken again after so many years of listening purely to Lithuanian and Russian. His eyes light up when he describes the restoration of colours to buildings that had long lain under a thick layer of Soviet grime. Adakris could only be a few years older than my father. His earliest memories would be of a similar place. And, although I had not come looking for the land of my father, it felt almost as though I had stumbled across it sipping coffee and listening to the stories of this elderly gentleman in his apartment off a cobbled courtyard in the heart of old Vilnius. Where to eat, drink and party in Vilnius Lunch Mano Kavine Boksto 7 Ave. Cost: \u00a33. Hidden away off the Town Hall Square, this fresh and funky caf\u008e offers the best salads in Vilnius.

      "body": "<p>The first odd thing about Socotra was the airport terminal. There wasn't one. Or rather, there were concrete stumps and wooden scaffolding rearing out of the shrimp-coloured earth. The outgoing passengers stood just off the runway in an arc of breezy cotton, supervised by thin soldiers in peach-and-spinach camouflaged kit. Behind them was a double row of sagging 4x4s. </p> <p>As we stood waiting for our bags to be unloaded, the 4x4 people scurried across the dust to grab the green bouquets of qat that the dealers had brought in from Yemen, the narcotic sheathed in three-feet tubes of palm fibre to keep it fresh. This is going to be different, I thought, sweating. </p> <p>Socotra, 74 miles long by 22 wide, fell off the mega continent Gondwana 140 million years ago. The ancestors of the qat-chewers, shipwrecked sailors or refugees from Africa (170 miles to the west) or Arabia (300 miles north), arrived here, maybe 5,000 years ago. Since then progress has been leisurely. The inhabitants - 30,000 or 75,000, no one seems quite sure - survive by fishing and cattle herding. A great many still live in caves. Up to 1990, they ran a purely barter economy. A recent report found that ailing islanders frequently tried to cure themselves by laying hot metal bars on their skin. In this context, even half an airport terminal seemed a significant advance. </p> <p>A dark, long-haired figure wearing a sarong and \"US Embassy, Yemen\" T-Shirt sauntered out of the crowd. Ferdinando was a former Italian Olympic horseman who had veered into the Indian Ocean leisure industry. \"I came two years ago and I stayed,\" he shrugged. The Yemeni authorities have decided their island's almost blissful state of innocence is ripe for exploitation. A British company, funded by the World Bank, has drawn up a 10-year tourist develop ment plan. Ferdinando had become the front man for one of Socotra's first holiday ventures. His business partners include the nephew of the Yemeni president. </p> <p>We climbed into a 4x4 and were catapulted along a crude, bulldozed track. Through the windows, we saw more pink rock topped by swollen-trunked shrubs crowned with what looked like dropping broccoli buds. </p> <p>\"Cucumber trees,\" declared Ferdinando. Cucumbers? On trees? But the cucumber trees swept past, to be replaced by rickety-looking stone huts, thatched with bleached palm leaves. In the front seat Ferdinando craned forward, shielding his eyes against the sun. He was hunting for a village that could be converted into a tourist camp, he explained. </p> <p>We crashed to a stop. If Socrata's first hotel (there already is a guest house) looked like a barracks, that was because it was one, or had been before conversion by Ferdinando's colleagues. It had 10ft-high armoured doors, white painted concrete walls, no hot water, and no electricity for part of each night. One evening we met a goat scampering down the hall. Still, it was correct, in its stark practicality. The hotel was one of only half-a-dozen two-storey buildings in Hadiboh, the very humble capital composed of flat-roofed, mud brick dwellings; anything less fundamental would have been a culture shock to Hadiboh's 2,000 hard-pressed citizens. </p> <p>The first written reference to Socotra, by an anonymous Greek Sailor in 60AD, noted that the inhabitants traded in tortoise shells and cinnabar trees and cooked with lizard oil. Tourism hopes are pinned on the island's still exotic bio-diversity. The United Nations is already halfway through a $5m conservation programme. At a spartan compound surrounded by cardboard-chewing goats, a weary Sudanese, Dr Salah Hakim, handed over a collection of scientific papers. </p> <p>The dossier read like Sindbad's mystic Isle of Serendib where \"rare plants grow abundantly, with cedar trees and cocoa palms\". Socotra has 273 botanically unique species. It also has the world's greatest variety of frankincense trees (seven). The red sap of the endemic Dragon Blood tree was prized by gladiators for its antiseptic and cosmetic properties. The Socotran aloe is farmed over the Middle East for its healing powers. Although the Socotran crocodile has gone the way of all flesh, the island still boasts 21 types of reptile, six birds and 113 insects found nowhere else. </p> <p>The only sad news concerned the sharks, which were now being plundered with impunity by rapacious Pakistani and Chinese fishermen, Dr Hakim claimed. There may be a geo-temperamental factor here. Ferdinando, a diving specialist, claimed Socotran fish were less nervous (and bigger) than any others. </p> <p>Certainly what was good for fishermen could be good for tourism: Ferdinando boasted he had already identified 10 sub-sea exploration sites, including a 1990 wreck. The next day, we jumped overboard from a shark-hunter's 25ft canoe. The fish were certainly prolific and, as far as anyone could tell, relaxed. </p> <p> Inland had another kind of magic. The Hagier mountains in the east are rich with red oxide and rear up from dried wadi beds in shaded dabs of aubergine and ginger. We lurched wildly in two 4x4s past groves of date palms and clusters of semi-derelict native huts. </p> <p>\"Something like this, exactly what I want,\" Ferdi nando cried. One of Dr Hakim's UN reports had described the higher ground as ideal for coffee-growing, but all we saw were shattered rocks and a cobweb of spindly shrubs in which young goats twitched like flies. The driver told us that an entrepreneur had tried to grow qat here, but gave up when it was stolen in the night. </p> <p>Dragon Blood trees sprouted like giant emerald mushrooms along the skyline. Below them, the spindly branches of the Socotran fig wriggled from a trunk that resembled a deflated barrage balloon. A column of Bedouin tugging fawn camels lurched past us. </p> <p>The jeeps jolted up a track and finally stopped before a cave where two Socotran families lived. It was about 200 yards wide and 100 deep, and subdivided here and there by low walls of limestone rock and sticks from which clothes and lamps dangled. Eighty feet above us, white-feathered Egyptian vultures drifted in between gnarled, water-dripping stalactites. I felt eerily as if I had strayed into some museum diorama. </p> <p>We were received courteously by a spry, treacle-faced figure in white cotton trousers whose hair had been stained tangerine with henna. He handed around glasses of tea and said he owned 10 camels and five goats. He was called Aissa and seemed shrewd and quite at ease. In the background, brightly-shawled women and children gazed, mutely, from behind their stone partitions. Aissa agreed to pose for photographs, provided his family were excluded, and stretched out like a pasha on the cave floor. Indeed, once you had swallowed the concept, a warm, roomy cave with fine views over the Indian Ocean had much to recommend it. I wondered how long this neo-prehistoric existence would survive. </p> <p>That evening we went to a shisha den and, for 15p each, lounged with 40 tawny islanders on cheap blue cushions, drawing strawberry molasses fumes from a gilded water pipe. On the last night, we stretched out on the barracks roof watching acrobatic goats slither over lorry bonnets. Two fireworks whirled pink and green across the sky like modern djinn, telling Moslems they could break their fast. </p> <p>Would sophisticated Europeans go for this delightful chaos, I wondered. Probably they should, I thought, before it is changed for ever.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.summer-yemen.com\">Summer</a> offers botanical, birdwatching, diving and general exploration holidays on Socotra for around \u00a3400pp per week between November and May. The price includes half-board accommodation, transport and guiding but not the air fare. For independent travellers, half-board at the Summer Hotel costs \u00a326 for a double room, less for singles; jeep hire is \u00a346 a day, cross-country camels \u00a313. Yemen airways (020-7491 7186) has two flights a week between Gatwick and Sana'a. Prices vary according to season, but a return flight between the UK and Socotra will cost well under \u00a3500.</p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's world</strong></p> <p><a href=\" http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/countries/story/0,7451,479478,00.html\">Walking on sunshine</a><br> Author Chris Stewart kicks off our Tomorrow's World special with a hike through some of Europe's most spectacular country - in southern Spain</p> <p><a href=\" http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/countries/story/0,7451,479548,00.html\">Basque it</a><br> The glitterati head for nearby Biarritz.

Tourism hopes are pinned on the island's still exotic bio-diversity. The United Nations is already halfway through a $5m conservation programme. At a spartan compound surrounded by cardboard-chewing goats, a weary Sudanese, Dr Salah Hakim, handed over a collection of scientific papers. The dossier read like Sindbad's mystic Isle of Serendib where \"rare plants grow abundantly, with cedar trees and cocoa palms\". Socotra has 273 botanically unique species. It also has the world's greatest variety of frankincense trees (seven). The red sap of the endemic Dragon Blood tree was prized by gladiators for its antiseptic and cosmetic properties. The Socotran aloe is farmed over the Middle East for its healing powers. Although the Socotran crocodile has gone the way of all flesh, the island still boasts 21 types of reptile, six birds and 113 insects found nowhere else. The only sad news concerned the sharks, which were now being plundered with impunity by rapacious Pakistani and Chinese fishermen, Dr Hakim claimed. There may be a geo-temperamental factor here. Ferdinando, a diving specialist, claimed Socotran fish were less nervous (and bigger) than any others. Certainly what was good for fishermen could be good for tourism: Ferdinando boasted he had already identified 10 sub-sea exploration sites, including a 1990 wreck. The next day, we jumped overboard from a shark-hunter's 25ft canoe. The fish were certainly prolific and, as far as anyone could tell, relaxed. Inland had another kind of magic. The Hagier mountains in the east are rich with red oxide and rear up from dried wadi beds in shaded dabs of aubergine and ginger. We lurched wildly in two 4x4s past groves of date palms and clusters of semi-derelict native huts. \"Something like this, exactly what I want,\" Ferdi nando cried. One of Dr Hakim's UN reports had described the higher ground as ideal for coffee-growing, but all we saw were shattered rocks and a cobweb of spindly shrubs in which young goats twitched like flies. The driver told us that an entrepreneur had tried to grow qat here, but gave up when it was stolen in the night. Dragon Blood trees sprouted like giant emerald mushrooms along the skyline. Below them, the spindly branches of the Socotran fig wriggled from a trunk that resembled a deflated barrage balloon. A column of Bedouin tugging fawn camels lurched past us. The jeeps jolted up a track and finally stopped before a cave where two Socotran families lived. It was about 200 yards wide and 100 deep, and subdivided here and there by low walls of limestone rock and sticks from which clothes and lamps dangled. Eighty feet above us, white-feathered Egyptian vultures drifted in between gnarled, water-dripping stalactites. I felt eerily as if I had strayed into some museum diorama. We were received courteously by a spry, treacle-faced figure in white cotton trousers whose hair had been stained tangerine with henna. He handed around glasses of tea and said he owned 10 camels and five goats. He was called Aissa and seemed shrewd and quite at ease. In the background, brightly-shawled women and children gazed, mutely, from behind their stone partitions. Aissa agreed to pose for photographs, provided his family were excluded, and stretched out like a pasha on the cave floor. Indeed, once you had swallowed the concept, a warm, roomy cave with fine views over the Indian Ocean had much to recommend it. I wondered how long this neo-prehistoric existence would survive. That evening we went to a shisha den and, for 15p each, lounged with 40 tawny islanders on cheap blue cushions, drawing strawberry molasses fumes from a gilded water pipe. On the last night, we stretched out on the barracks roof watching acrobatic goats slither over lorry bonnets. Two fireworks whirled pink and green across the sky like modern djinn, telling Moslems they could break their fast. Would sophisticated Europeans go for this delightful chaos, I wondered. Probably they should, I thought, before it is changed for ever. Way to go Summer offers botanical, birdwatching, diving and general exploration holidays on Socotra for around \u00a3400pp per week between November and May. The price includes half-board accommodation, transport and guiding but not the air fare. For independent travellers, half-board at the Summer Hotel costs \u00a326 for a double room, less for singles; jeep hire is \u00a346 a day, cross-country camels \u00a313. Yemen airways (020-7491 7186) has two flights a week between Gatwick and Sana'a. Prices vary according to season, but a return flight between the UK and Socotra will cost well under \u00a3500.

      "body": "<p>Most people haven't a clue where or what the Alpujarra is; to have heard of it, you need to have read Gerald Brenan's South from Granada or the turgidly romantic 19th-century travelogue by Pedro-Antonio de Alarc\u00f3n - or indeed my own book. The only quotable quote about the place comes from Fernando of Arag\u00f3n: \"I'd rather a grave in Granada,\" he quipped, \"than a palace in the Alpujarra.\" </p> <p>Still, through one means and another, I came to know the Alpujarra 14 years ago and, having seen it, made up my mind to live in it, which I've been doing ever since. </p> <p>The Alpujarra is the system of hills and valleys that make up the southern slopes of the Sierra Nevada in Andaluc\u00eda. As an area for walking, it is difficult to beat: sunshine is constant, and the beauty and variety of the landscape, the character of the villages and the richness of the botany are a real delight. </p> <p>The Alpujarra starts at what is known as the Granada coast. From here, you can head up into the hills of the Contraviesa, the long counterscarp of the Sierra Nevada. The hills are cloaked in Mediterranean maquis, lavenders, thymes, sages, rosemary, genista, asparagus and pines. The Contraviesa botany reaches its crescendo around the pretty village of Polopos, set in a bowl of hills overlooking the sea. Polopos produces a wine that is unaccountably famous locally. It also has a particularly delightful little guest-house and restaurant - la Posada. </p> <p>Nobody goes walking on the Contraviesa; it's too hot and dry in summer, but in spring it's a feast of flowers, and from the old ways that follow the contours from village to village, there are unforgettable views of the high mountains and the sea. Apart from Polopos, there's Sorvil\u00e1n and Rubite, unspoilt and baking in the spring sunshine, and at Haza del Lino there's a restaurant, el Paso del Jabal\u00ed, which specialises in wild boar. </p> <p>The southern side of the Contraviesa is covered in vines. The wine that is produced here, costa, is believed by locals to be the only wine on earth worth drinking. This is, in fact, far from the truth; until now costa has been a dismal brown wine with a bouquet that puts you in mind of wet dogs. </p> <p>It needn't be so though. Over to the east, near Murtas, are the vineyards of Barranco Oscuro. Manolo Valenzuela claims his vineyard is the highest in the world so close to the sea, a fact that gives his wines inestimable advantages. He produces a wine known as 1368 - the altitude of the vineyard - and a number of other whites, reds and ros\u00e9s, as well as a delicious cava, a worthy rival to good Champagne. His wines are so good, and now so sought after that it's often difficult to get hold of them. </p> <p>Manolo, who is a man mad for winemaking, bursting with energy and passion, is now spreading his outrageous ideas of hygiene and consistency among the more traditionally-entrenched local producers. The results promise to be good. </p> <p>This is the New Alpujarra. Twelve years ago, the region was a forgotten backwater, stagnant and brown like its wine. Now, little by little, it is being shaken from its sloth by imaginative and energetic dreamers. And it's often in the manifestations of this change that the pleasure and excitement of the area lies. In the wake of the innovators comes the rural tourism, and it's doing just what rural tourism ought to do, injecting the influences, the ideas and the cash right where they are needed rather than passing them through unwieldy, organisations. </p> <p>From the almonds and vines of the high slopes, you could drop down the north side of the Contraviesa to the valleys of the Guadalfeo river. Here you can wander among the fertile vegas watered by the river. Oranges and lemons fill the air with their scent in April, May and June, and there are bananas and avocados and even custard apples at this level. Or you can walk in the riverbeds among the canebreaks and the tamarisk with its odd scent of burnt raspberry jam, to the singing of frogs, nightingales and golden orioles. From \u00d3rgiva, the main town of the Alpujarra, you could walk in a day all the way up to the beautiful Alquer\u00eda de Morayma, another fine example of new Alpujarra. </p> <p>The Alquer\u00eda de Morayma, near C\u00e1diar, is the creation of another inspired Alpujarre\u00f1o, Mariano Cruz. Mariano bought a ruin of a wayside inn and rebuilt it with all the beauty and none of the squalor of 200 years ago. Here you can eat well, stay in exquisite rooms, swim in the pool, go walking, riding or engage in one of the many pursuits organised by the hotel. </p> <p> At about 1,000m, you leave the citrus and olive zones and enter the chestnut woods and cherry orchards of the high villages. Up here, too, the flora is dazzling in its richness and variety. There are ancient paths, mule roads, engineered by sorcery and arts long forgotten, their stone cut steps and walls leading you effortlessly up seemingly impossible hills. In the spring months and early summer it's like walking through an endless herbaceous border. </p> <p>The Sierra Nevada is known for the richness of its flora. A richness that is a result of the different geographical influences that bear on the Sierra Nevada - Atlantic, Mediterranean, North African, European and Alpine. Even when the spring flowers have withered away, there are still the summer plants - the lavenders, thymes, various brooms with their sweet-scented yellow flowers, thorny wild asparagus, lavateras, cistus, wild pistachios, mountain ash, holm-oak and hollies, phlomis and vile-smelling rue. The smell of it all is almost overpowering and when you come down out of the scrub, your trousers smell sweet with rosemary and thyme. </p> <p>There are creatures, too, to delight the foot-traveller - Swallowtail butterflies, small blues, orange tips, hosts of them. There are ibex everywhere, a fine sight as they dance gracefully across sheer rockfaces, their young skip ping behind. There are boars, too, lurking timidly in the undergrowth by day, ready to ravage the potatoes and maize at night. Then there's bats at sunset, and hoopoes, too, and kestrels and rollers and Bonelli's eagles and vultures and at dusk the sky is full of bee-eaters like rainbow parrots when the sun catches their wings. Higher up, above the tree-line, live the solitary desperadoes of the animal kingdom, the ravens and choughs and a curious high mountain beetle. </p> <p>You can stay in the villages or in outlying cortijos - there's a proliferation of guest-houses and country hotels. in Mairena, in the quieter but equally beautiful Eastern Alpujarra, close to Gerald Brenan's Yegen, there's the enchanting Las Chimeneas run by an English couple. a little more opulent is Prado del Toro above Pitres, where you stay in the most beautiful neo-moresque rooms deep in the countryside above the village. similarly, above Capileira, there's Catifalarga, where you can enjoy concerts on summer nights beneath the stars. </p> <p>Alpujarran gastronomy is, to be truthful, not among the world's best, but things are on the move here, too. El Jard\u00edn in Pitres serves vegetarian food but it's good, and the setting and ambiance are spectacular. A similar treat is Jean-Claude's L'Atelier in Mecinilla, and the better products of the pig are to be had at La Forja in Trev\u00e9lez. </p> <p>In Lanjar\u00f3n, you can eat good fish at la Marisqueria, and in \u00d3rgiva you could do worse than la Almazara or Ram\u00f3n's Mirasierra. In Bubi\u00f3n, you can sip mint tea and nibble Arab pastries while you fool around on the internet in the neo-andalusi Cybermonf\u00ed tea-house. </p> <p>If you're desperate to go for a walk - and you may be by now - you could be in Malaga in two and a half hours from London, and within another two hours, you're deep in the mountains.</p> <p><strong>'The most beautiful walk in the Alpujarra'</strong></p> <p>\u00eb don't know why I'm telling you this; it's a sure way to louse up a favourite walk. But it would be wrong in a way not to share it. After all, it isn't mine . . . </p> <p>There are countless beautiful walks in the Alpujarra, but it's hard to beat the Carihuela de Mecina Fondales for flowers, vistas, atmosphere and the beauty of the path itself.</p> <p>You could start in Fondales, deep down in the gorge of the R'o Trev\u008elez. Wind your way down to the bottom of the village and leave through the covered wash-house. The path cuts steeply down through a poplar and chestnut wood, and finally down to what is known as the Roman bridge. Cross the bridge and follow the path uphill.</p> <p>There follows about 45 minutes of gentle climbing on an ancient rock-built road that curls and twists among the crags and pinnacles of the river gorge. Steep stone steps lift you easily up the more dramatic bits, while on the gentler gradients the path passes between banks of flowers. It's difficult to believe you're not walking through a cultivated garden. Savour this, because there are not many paths quite like it anywhere.</p> <p>At the top, you are rewarded with magnificent views of the mountains receding to the west and of the villages on the other side of the gorge with the Sierra Nevada in the background.</p> <p>You could turn and go back the way you came; it looks different from the other direction - or you could turn east along the wide track cut into the hillside. About 40 minutes along here, through a forest of pine, spruce and holm oak, you come to a bulldozed track leading back down into the gorge, opposite a little huddle of mineworkers' cottages. Follow this down to the river by another beautiful ancient way of steep rock-cut steps. Cross the river by the ancient hydro-electric station of Ferreirola - turn of the century and the first one in the province of Granada - and take the steady ascent back towards the west.</p> <p>Twenty minutes among lush agricultural terraces brings you to the lovely village of Ferreirola (several excellent guesthouses: <a href=\"http://www.nevadensis.com\">www.nevadensis.com</a>) and from Ferreirola, it's but 20 minutes back through the woods to Mecina.</p> <p>\u0095 Chris Stewart's Driving Over Lemons is published is published by Sort Of Books at \u00a36.99.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p>Chris Stewart guides for <a href=\"http://www.andalucian-adventures.co.uk\">Andalucian Adventures</a> (01453 834137), which offers guided walking holidays in the Alpujarra with selected departures in spring and autumn.

You could turn and go back the way you came; it looks different from the other direction - or you could turn east along the wide track cut into the hillside. About 40 minutes along here, through a forest of pine, spruce and holm oak, you come to a bulldozed track leading back down into the gorge, opposite a little huddle of mineworkers' cottages. Follow this down to the river by another beautiful ancient way of steep rock-cut steps. Cross the river by the ancient hydro-electric station of Ferreirola - turn of the century and the first one in the province of Granada - and take the steady ascent back towards the west. Twenty minutes among lush agricultural terraces brings you to the lovely village of Ferreirola (several excellent guesthouses: www.nevadensis.com) and from Ferreirola, it's but 20 minutes back through the woods to Mecina. \u0095 Chris Stewart's Driving Over Lemons is published is published by Sort Of Books at \u00a36.99.

      "body": "<p>The US Forestry Service's idea of a good holiday home is a single-room cabin with no running water, a view across half of America and no neighbours for tens of miles in any direction. To get there, you may have to walk or ski through forests, you'll need to know what to do should you encounter a bear, and you'll have to bring all your food, bedding, water and beer on your back. In short, it's the sort of place Jack London would have felt at home. </p> <p>Surprisingly, lots of Americans appear to feel the same and many Forestry Service cabins are rented out year-round to outdoor types looking for something that sits at the very end of the road less travelled. </p> <p>The service has hundreds of properties scattered throughout some of the most spectacular and unspoilt landscapes in North America. They were built in the first half of the 20th century as lookout cabins and towers, guard stations or work centres in remote forest and mountain locations, but in recent years their use by the service has declined, so many are now rented out to people wanting to get as far away from it all as possible. </p> <p>The lookout cabins and towers in particular are great if you're after a cheap room with a stunning view, the view being their raison d' \u00eatre. In the past, Forest Service employees would spend entire summers alone in these cabins, scanning the horizon for the first signs of smoke that indicated a forest fire. </p> <p>To use the Forestry Service's own terse description, their cabins are \"rustic and primitive\". They all come with bunks (but not necessarily mattresses), a stove, propane cooker, tables and chairs - but that's about it. The chemical toilet may be more than 100 yards away in the woods; you'll need to bring your own drinking water (and it's surprising how much a person uses in a day, and how heavy it is); you'll have to chop your own firewood; and, thank God, mobile phones generally don't work in these necks of the woods. </p> <p>Such basic accommodation means that cost isn't a consideration - the cheapest cabins are around $20 a night and sleep four, and even an eight-person unit will only set you back $50-$60 a night. </p> <p>When I stayed at West Fork Butte Lookout Cabin, 6,000ft up in the Bitterroot Mountains of north-west Montana, my biggest concern was whether I should prioritise water over beer in terms of the liquids that I'd be lugging to my lodgings. But that was before I'd realised I could drive to within half a mile of the cabin. </p> <p>West Fork Butte wasn't the classic lookout tower on top of a rickety timber frame (although these can also be rented, and involve scaling a ladder or wooden staircase and scrambling through a trapdoor). My accommodation was a 14ft by 14ft timber structure perched on top of bare rock slabs and secured with steel hawsers bolted into the rock. </p> <p>Inside were two squeaky bunks, a stove, a cooker and a chair; outside, through huge windows, a view across the blue ridges of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, rolling west into Idaho, snow patches still visible on the summits, although it was summer. I couldn't see a road or a building in any direction, and all that could be heard was the soughing of a warm wind from the south, the creak of the trees in the wind and the clink of rocks as chipmunks scittered around under the cabin. This was a place where you could really feel alone, even if your car was only half a mile away. </p> <p>The visitor's book was full of glowing comments on the great views, proximity of nature and often God. </p> <p>Had I been a real fire lookout man, I'd have had work to do that evening, as a purple mass of cloud to the south began spitting lightning down into the forests below - I found out the next day that this was one of the storms that was responsible for the huge wildfires that burnt throughout the region last summer. </p> <p>There is actually quite a lot you can do at a lookout cabin besides admiring the view, reading books and writing postcards. There's the wildlife to watch, for starters. The chipmunks living outside are cute, but are to be discouraged as they can pass on diseases. I suppose bears and mountain lions ought to be discouraged, too - this is grizzly as well as black bear territory - and there are deer and birds as well. There's no end of trails to walk or bike if you have a good map, and some cabins are close to mountain lakes, where you can swim or fish. And, if you're so minded and have the licence, you could go out and shoot something. </p> <p>There's also work to be done - if you use firewood, you're expected to cut more for the next visitors; the cabin should be cleaned before you leave; and all rubbish must be \"packed out\". </p> <p>Evening was the best time at the cabin - a basic meal cooked on a basic stove and a warm beer (no fridge, no ice) may not appeal to more refined palates, but the liberating sensation of being totally alone on top of a mountain in a landscape way more remote than anything Britain has to offer more than made up for the food. And I like baked beans anyway. </p> <p>In winter, the cabins are popular with cross-country skiers, and I imagine it must be an equally wonderful experience to sit on top of an isolated, snowy mountain with a few friends, a fire roaring in the stove, skis propped outside and a glass of whiskey in your hand. According to the visitors' book at West Fork Butte, plenty of people had spent Christmas or New Year up there. </p> <p>Whether I'd go and eat my Christmas pud at West Fork Butte, I'm not sure. But if you're looking for a summer weekend out in the American wilderness, a lookout cabin has a lot going for it.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p>For details of staying in US Forest Service cabins and lookout towers, contact <a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/\">USDA Forest Service</a>, Recreation, Heritage and Wilderness Resources, PO Box 96090, Washington DC, US 20090-6090 (tel: 001 202 205 1706). Advance reservations of a week or more may be required, and some cabins have a maximum stay of three days.

But that was before I'd realised I could drive to within half a mile of the cabin. West Fork Butte wasn't the classic lookout tower on top of a rickety timber frame (although these can also be rented, and involve scaling a ladder or wooden staircase and scrambling through a trapdoor). My accommodation was a 14ft by 14ft timber structure perched on top of bare rock slabs and secured with steel hawsers bolted into the rock. Inside were two squeaky bunks, a stove, a cooker and a chair; outside, through huge windows, a view across the blue ridges of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, rolling west into Idaho, snow patches still visible on the summits, although it was summer. I couldn't see a road or a building in any direction, and all that could be heard was the soughing of a warm wind from the south, the creak of the trees in the wind and the clink of rocks as chipmunks scittered around under the cabin. This was a place where you could really feel alone, even if your car was only half a mile away. The visitor's book was full of glowing comments on the great views, proximity of nature and often God. Had I been a real fire lookout man, I'd have had work to do that evening, as a purple mass of cloud to the south began spitting lightning down into the forests below - I found out the next day that this was one of the storms that was responsible for the huge wildfires that burnt throughout the region last summer. There is actually quite a lot you can do at a lookout cabin besides admiring the view, reading books and writing postcards. There's the wildlife to watch, for starters. The chipmunks living outside are cute, but are to be discouraged as they can pass on diseases. I suppose bears and mountain lions ought to be discouraged, too - this is grizzly as well as black bear territory - and there are deer and birds as well. There's no end of trails to walk or bike if you have a good map, and some cabins are close to mountain lakes, where you can swim or fish. And, if you're so minded and have the licence, you could go out and shoot something. There's also work to be done - if you use firewood, you're expected to cut more for the next visitors; the cabin should be cleaned before you leave; and all rubbish must be \"packed out\". Evening was the best time at the cabin - a basic meal cooked on a basic stove and a warm beer (no fridge, no ice) may not appeal to more refined palates, but the liberating sensation of being totally alone on top of a mountain in a landscape way more remote than anything Britain has to offer more than made up for the food. And I like baked beans anyway. In winter, the cabins are popular with cross-country skiers, and I imagine it must be an equally wonderful experience to sit on top of an isolated, snowy mountain with a few friends, a fire roaring in the stove, skis propped outside and a glass of whiskey in your hand. According to the visitors' book at West Fork Butte, plenty of people had spent Christmas or New Year up there. Whether I'd go and eat my Christmas pud at West Fork Butte, I'm not sure. But if you're looking for a summer weekend out in the American wilderness, a lookout cabin has a lot going for it. Way to go For details of staying in US Forest Service cabins and lookout towers, contact USDA Forest Service, Recreation, Heritage and Wilderness Resources, PO Box 96090, Washington DC, US 20090-6090 (tel: 001 202 205 1706). Advance reservations of a week or more may be required, and some cabins have a maximum stay of three days. The Forestry Service discourages children under 12 from staying in lookout towers, and if you're travelling in winter, you should check on local weather conditions.

      "body": "<p>An unprecedented collaboration betweeen national and regional museums and galleries will result in a festival celebrating six centuries of British art and design, from medieval furniture to the fashion creations of John Galliano, next autumn and winter.</p> <p>Their customary internecine warfare has been suspended, and the museums in London, Liverpool and Edinburgh have come together to create and market the six-month British art season, which will also be launched in New York and Paris in the coming months.</p> <p>The project was greeted yesterday with a sigh of relief by the arts minister Alan Howarth.

Their customary internecine warfare has been suspended, and the museums in London, Liverpool and Edinburgh have come together to create and market the six-month British art season, which will also be launched in New York and Paris in the coming months. The project was greeted yesterday with a sigh of relief by the arts minister Alan Howarth. 'It will refute the heresy, which has been spreading like a virus, and demonstrate that Britain is not a land simply ridden with pestilence and desolation but a land containing the greatest beauties, natural and artistic,' he said. The exhibitions will feature everything from contemporary sculpture and fashion to an exhibition of pastoral landscapes on banknotes at the British Museum. The sculptor Tony Cragg will get one of the most spectacular outdoor spaces in London, the restored riverside terrace at Somerset House, for a free exhibition of new work. Rachel Whiteread will mount her first major solo show, in London, and in Edinburgh where she is creating a new piece, a cast of the space beneath a mortuary slab in a historic graveyard. Exhibitions of painting and prints, sculpture and photographs, fashion and furniture will be mounted at museums including the V&amp;A; the Design Museum, which will examine John Galliano's work at the couture house Christian Dior; the Royal Academy, a restrospective of Frank Auerbach; the Dulwich Picture Gallery; and the Scottish National Galleries of art and photography. The British Museum will hold an exhbition marking the centenary of Stanley William Hayter, a British-born painter who moved to Paris and later New York, and became one of the most influential print makers in the world. At the National Portrait Gallery, Painted Ladies will feature portraits by Lely of some of the beauties of the court of Charles II. The season will coincide with a string of lottery-funded museum openings and extensions, including Tate Britain's centenary development, which will increase the gallery space at Millbank by over a third; the new British Galleries at the V&amp;A which will bring together 3,000 objects and five restored period rooms; and the Handel museum in his London house. The final opening will be in February, at the Museums and Galleries of Merseyside, where staff are still in shock after the recent suicide of their founding director, Sir Richard Foster. His massive development project, which attracted the largest ever heritage lottery museum grant of over \u00a323m, will come to fruition with the reopening of the Walker Art Gallery, the classical temple in the heart of the city, with the first major study of the 18th-century art of George Romney.",

      "body": "<p>Eva Hoffman stands at the lectern at the Sheldonian theatre at Oxford University like a bird drinking. Her head dips down in sharp, refreshing pecks to the manuscript in front of her. She stands as she writes, poised high above sentimentality or excess. Malcolm Bowie, professor of French at Oxford, compares her to Primo Levi. It is difficult to imagine higher praise for a writer. She was born in 1945 in Cracow. Her parents had survived the Holocaust by hiding in a bunker in the Ukrainian forest; they then hid for a further year among hay bales in an unheated barn, concealed by a mute peasant. When Hoffman was 13, the family emigrated to Vancouver without a word of English: a city on the opposite side of the world in every sense. </p> <p>Everything changed. Her father, Boris Wydra, was, she writes, almost overthrown by the order and predictability he found there, like a sailor whose legs betray him on the dockside. But she and her sister, Alina, who is three years younger, somehow found their balance in the New World. She gave up her ambition to be a concert pianist and, aged 19, emigrated again to Texas, before moving to New York, where she became what she had discovered she wanted to be - a metropolitan intellectual. </p> <p>Nowadays she lives in Hampstead, in London - \"halfway between Manhattan and Cracow\" - just down the road from the Freud museum. She commutes to her job in the US - she is visiting professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology - and has taught creative writing at the University of East Anglia. Yet this life of free-floating sophistication is rooted in her extraordinary understanding of the confined and tangle-rooted cultures of eastern Europe. Hoffman's mother, Maria, though she survived the unimaginable privations and dangers of the war, never ran or swam in her entire life. Respectable girls from a religious Jewish background could not do so. This was so ingrained that Maria Wydra did not bother to mention it until the subject came up when her daughter was 20. \"Every immigrant,\" says Eva Hoffman, \"becomes a kind of amateur anthropologist.\" </p> <p>Everything is strange to the eye of a stranger. What makes her extraordinary as a writer is that she can recapture the sense that life must be constantly made understandable, yet will never become familiar. This trick is most subtle when she writes about things we already think we understand: Polish anti-semitism in Shtetl, her history of a settlement on the borders of Poland and Belarus; and in Exit into History, the aftermath of the Velvet Revolutions. In both cases, she looks at the fine detail of people's lives and waits until they appear before the reader, as serious, knotty and untranslateable as we appear to ourselves. </p> <p>Roy Foster, professor of modern history at Oxford, says: \"She writes about ethnic or racial relations, which are sometimes treated in a very simplistic way, and she makes it clear how complicated they are.\" </p> <p>She understands that everyone is on someone else's periphery: when, in Shtetl, she visits the market in a small town in eastern Poland, where the Jews were exterminated, she sees: \"Ruddy-faced farmers in sheepskin coats with high leather boots . . . stomping their feet in the snow for warmth. I observe them with a double vision. They are rough-and-ready looking men, huddling in small groups, exchanging idle remarks. That is all. But in post-Holocaust ethnography, they have come to be seen as allegories of anti-semitism. In their faces, if you look at them a certain way, nothing but this essential hatred can be discerned.\" </p> <p>But she flips the mirror so that she shares their intolerance. \"The way, undoubtedly, that to some of them a Jew was a pure type, of greed, cleverness and manipulativeness. I know that there may be some truth to the Polish stereotype: that in some of their hearts, anti-semitism sprouts. But I also know that, on both sides, these are reductions, pure, simple and sometimes very dangerous.\" </p> <p>Her picture of the complexities of the Holocaust grows out of family experience. Her parents were betrayed several times by Gentile peasants to the Germans who would have killed them, as all their relatives were killed. But they also survived because of the bravery and self-sacrifice of other peasants - who would themselves have been killed had the Wydras been discovered. And Hoffman's aunt and niece were betrayed to their deaths by other Jews. This is why she is able to say: \"An injunction to remember can become an injunction not to think, not to grapple with the past: such an injunction seems to me to verge on bad faith.\" In other words, a facile and distorted memory is almost a greater insult than simply forgetting. No wonder Foster sees in her an example to be followed by everyone who writes Irish history. </p> <p>He likes her, too: \"She has a compelling personality. Charming would be the wrong word - but I have seen her in a long and very absorbed conversation with Isaiah Berlin [the late philosopher] the first time they met. Obviously he was a great charmer, but she was exerting her own compulsion, too, on him.\" </p> <p>Much of her historical writing is concerned with the intricacies of individual memory, as a guard against the blurring sweeps of collectivism. Her own memory, as revealed in the autobiographical Lost in Translation, has a most extraordinary vividness and purity. Her childhood, sealed off as it was by exile and loss of language, re-emerges in a continuous present, full of all the small anchoring details that make our surroundings real. When they reach Vancouver, she cannot believe that lavatory paper comes in different colours. </p> <p>In Cracow they had been happy without any of that. \"I didn't know I was economically deprived. There were so many things that are important for a child. There was a sense of community and solidarity and neighbourliness because of the terrible times that everyone had been through. The barriers were lower between people. And as a child I was not overstimulated. There was human intimacy, but also a lot of space to muse, to play and to imagine.\" </p> <p>In Cracow, her parents had been happy. They had lost their families, their religious faith, their trust in any institution. But they had survived. They were among people who had also suffered and were making the best of a new world; soon they emerged towards the top of the new society. The Wydras might have had only three rooms in their flat, but there was a maid who slept in the kitchen - a Jew who had been a servant in the house of the peasants who had sheltered them, though they had not known then that she was Jewish. </p> <p>Boris Wydra made his living hustling and trading, seldom legally - to break communist laws was a patriotic act in Poland. But he managed to accumulate enough money for his family to have a middle-class life, with restaurant meals and concerts and piano lessons for his daughters: he even obtained a Russian motorbike in 1956: the magnitude of this achievement is reflected in the fact that no one they knew owned any sort of motorised vehicle, let alone a car. The traffic on the cobbled streets consisted of trams and horse-drawn carts, \"although in the busiest parts of the city there are occasionally several cars in a row, which seem to tear by at enormous speeds\". </p> <p>But the real distance of this past comes out in its pictures of femininity. Her mother did not just avoid running because it was ill-bred. She also had, writes Hoffman, a peasant's \"ancient notion - which came from centuries of hard labour - that the ideal state of life is getting enough rest . . . laziness shows a certain luxuriance of character, the eroticism of valuing your pleasure. 'You know, Ormianska calls the maid from the kitchen to get her matches, which are lying 10 centimetres away from her', my mother says, half in criticism, half in admiration. Such egotism is at the heart of feminine power, which consists in the ability to make others do things for you, to be pampered.\" </p> <p>Her friend, the novelist Lisa Appignanesi, says: \"The Poles, like the British, have internalised an ideal aristocracy and this comes through very clearly in Eva's work. The importance given to music, the sense of being cultivated. Jews carried that as well. They carried it into the countries where they went - the women wore gloves, I mean, everyone wore gloves. My mother had, like, 100 pairs.\" </p> <p>Appignanesi, although another Polish Jew, whose parents emigrated to Canada when she was two, does not have Hoffman's keen sense of Polish life as a living undercurrent to all other possible ways of living. Hoffman says: \"I am interested in how we are constructed by language and by culture. There is some kind of dialectic going on, but we can never grasp what it is that engages with language.\" </p> <p>The great dislocation which made this process visible to her was emigration and the change of language. But after seeing it in her own life, she sees elements of the process everywhere. Her book Exit into History is really an account of how people coped with being exiled into the future at the end of the Cold War. Shtetl is in some ways an account of an emigration that never was; and of the way in which Jews and Christians were never forced to come to terms with each other as living complicated beings, in need of translation, until it was too late. They lived side by side as strangers until catastrophe overwhelmed them both. The Jews, of course, were more thoroughly overwhelmed, but though others escaped with their lives, they were still forced to flee. When Hoffman and her sister finally visited Zalosce, the small town near Lvov where their parents came from, they found three Jews living there, of whom one, she says, was a \"public\" Jew. But Jews were not the only people to have disappeared. Zalosce had in 1939, when it was part of Poland, been one third Polish, one third Ukrainian and one third Jewish. Today there are three Poles left, to go with the three Jews. </p> <p> Indeed, Hoffman was hardly aware of her own Jewishness until she was seven or more. Most of her Cracow childhood was unaffectedly Polish. Michael Ignatieff, who has known her for 30 years, since they were at Harvard together, says: \"She doesn't shut off any side of her. Most people who are Polish-Jewish decide to be one or the other. She has decided to be both.\" </p> <p>Now Hoffman sees that her father was a shtetl trader, one of a long line of Jews who had made their livings in the markets of eastern Europe for centuries. In Vancouver, he started a business selling second-hand furniture, which eventually prospered. But he never really adjusted to life in Canada. \"My father was fantastic at coping with crises and with dangerous situations and I think he was very flummoxed by the quiet orderliness of the world he came into.\" </p> <p>In Poland, Hoffman's recognised gifts had been musical, not literary. She was to have been a concert pianist and there is still a Bechstein grand in her Hampstead house. \"I would find it very hard to live without a piano,\" she says. \"At the moment I am reading my way through all the Beethoven sonatas, even though I have played most of them. Otherwise, I play for myself the classical Romantic repertoire - Chopin, Schumann.\" </p> <p>She gave up on a musical career because she felt she would never reach the top. \"There are so many peerless pianists and the repertory has been recorded at a super level 20 times over. I could have been good but I didn't think I had anything to add to that.\" </p> <p>Emigration disrupted her piano studies to some extent, though in Vancouver her Russian piano teacher was the first real friend she made there. At 19, she decided to go to Rice University in Texas, 2,000 miles away, to study literature. \"It was the only private university in the States which would pay my tuition fees: It was supposed to be very good. I had no larger picture. But it turned out to be a very good school. Of course, it was another planet to move to.\" </p> <p>As part of the difficulties of an immigrant, she points out that when taken to college football games, she never knew where the ball was. She literally could not see it. You might expect her to be puzzled by the discovery that in Canada there are bedrooms for everyone, or by the terrors and rituals of dating in the early 1960s - why would anyone try to impress a girl by taking her to a drive-in hamburger joint? But the difficulties she had at football games are more illuminating. </p> <p>\"I witness rituals as arcane as Aztec ceremonies - elaborate ceremonies of floodlit cheerleading, collective genuflections to a large stuffed owl, which is the university's mascot, and once a near riot which starts up when an umpire's decision provokes streams of boys from both warring camps to run down the bleachers with the full intention of attacking each other - only to be stopped dead when the Rice band strikes up the national anthem. It is their respect for the law which astonishes me as much as all their bloodlust.\" </p> <p>In fact, she sees almost everything on the football field except the ball. If the game makes no sense, you have no idea what the ball should be doing, nor where it might be. Hence it remained invisible to her in all her years at university in Texas. All she could see were oddly dressed men, running around shouting. </p> <p>Yet she persisted with arcane aspects of US culture. It is part of the promise of America that all immigrants will get there in the end. From Rice, she travelled another 1,000 miles, north to Harvard, where she took a doctorate in English, after deciding not to study music at Juilliard. She married a fellow student, changing her name from the tricky \"Wydra\" to the thoroughly American \"Hoffman\", and kept the name when she left him after seven years. He got his PhD and went into advertising, where he prospered. They had no children and she has not married again. </p> <p>By the time of the divorce, she had decided she had no vocation as a full-time academic. She wanted to be a New York intellectual: to be a critic of culture, not just literature and to help form the opinions of people who really mattered in New York - which, as every New Yorker knows, is the centre of the universe - as well as going to all the smart parties. </p> <p>But she was finding success elusive. She had, she says, none of the pain and active discrimination that earlier immigrants experienced - it is hardly a disadvantage, if you want to be a New York intellectual, to have started off as a Polish Jew. Within the limits of her ability and ambition, she could go anywhere she wanted. \"The only joke is that there's no there when you get there.\" </p> <p>She discovered psychoanalysis, which she took, and still takes, very seriously. Perhaps it supplied a way of trying to find that core of human personality which seems so elusive when moving from culture to culture. She worked in the features department of the New York Times, in \"ideas and trends\" and \"arts and leisure\". \"I was accompanied still at that point by a great deal of immigrant anxiety: whether anyone would want me, or would give me a job - all of that.\" A down-dragging grin stabs at the corner of her mouth when she says this. \"I started doing some essayistic, journalistic writing.\" </p> <p>Then she returned to Poland, to try and rediscover where she had come from and the language which once she had spoken. </p> <p>\"Poland had really obliged by staying really static\", she says, conscious of the irony. Her successful friends now had cars, but communism had slowed the pace of change in most of the city. She found that her past had been conveniently relocated to a foreign country a manageable plane ride away; and so she wrote Lost in Translation. It was praised enormously from the moment of publication in 1989. Czeslaw Milosz called it \"graceful and profound\", an opinion which is worth having from a man whose memoirs of his own Lithuanian-Polish childhood had helped to win him the Nobel prize. Americans seem to have taken it as a story of how one becomes a successful American; outsiders as a story of how to keep your distance from the country. Foster says: \"It is one of those books you keep on giving to people.\" </p> <p>What makes it astonishing for a first book in a second language is the immediate, natural tone. She has brought to writing something of the same freshness that springs from the sort of unending discipline a classical pianist needs. It comes as a shock to discover that someone who writes English with such liquid and transparent grace has a pronounced Polish-American accent. </p> <p>Her next book, Exit into History, was not a history of the revolutions in eastern Europe, but an examination of how particular lives had been changed by them. Some were friends of hers, but the most remarkable passages concerned former communists. The good ones tended to have been imprisoned. They had at least suffered for their beliefs, and so had their parents, at a time when communism was a faith full of hope. One story concerns a friend of Hoffman's generation who was imprisoned by the communists in 1968. Because the woman's father was a high-ranking communist, she was offered a pardon if she made an apology. Her father was allowed to visit her, and told her how he had been imprisoned as a communist by the pre-war Polish government, and had been offered an amnesty if he would disavow communism. He was then visited - the chain goes back into history - by his own father, who told him: \"As you know, I am not a communist. I don't agree with you. But as for mercy, we don't plead for it.\" </p> <p>So the friend knew what to do, and served her sentence out. Courage and style, Hoffman sees, have a value which quite outlasts the causes that they serve. </p> <p>She did not really suffer under communism. One of the reasons she did not move back to Poland, when it became possible, was that, \"My generation in Poland had such a shared experience of coming through things of history and I would be partially an outsider to that.\" None the less, her magnanimity towards the communists is astonishing. The true believers appear to her more comic than anything else, in their sudden dispossession. When they ruled the country, they were \"Them\" with a capital T. Robbed of their power, knocked down to a dismissive lower case, she still finds in the best of them some dignity. One Polish communist, aged 84, \"puts me incongruously in mind of a minor character in one of Tolstoy's novels - an outmoded Enlightenment rationalist who has outlasted his time, and who continues to putter in his private laboratory, ignoring the world which has overtaken him, performing his pointless scientific experiments with great clarity of mind and sturdy cheerfulness\". </p> <p>It is entirely characteristic of Hoffman to find \"sturdy cheerfulness\" a virtue in a man who had been on the side of great wickedness. She has less time for the bad communists, the ones who worked the system just because it was the system, and were just as happy to adapt to capitalism when that was called for. One was the man who had censored the films of the Polish director Krzystof Kieslowski. He believed, by the end, that he was on the side of the people he censored; that by cleverness and disdain for the rules he operated he was really helping the artists. In fact, starting from socialist realism, he had reached flawless postmodern conclusions. \"I can interpret anything in the way I want. I can make anything mean one thing and its opposite. Because, in literature, anything can mean anything.\" This man has become a publisher, where he is disgusted by the inefficiency and lack of enterprise among his colleagues in the private sector. </p> <p>All these things Hoffman records with a sympathy that is like the heat in August: it sinks in, resistlessly, until it permeates everything; but is qualified by an acerbic sobriety which is the flipside of Polish romanticism, so you don't feel at the end like forgiving the people she describes. It would be a kind of impertinence. </p> <p>The same quality informs Shtetl, her history of a small town similar to the one her parents came from. She will not yank on heartstrings, even when she has exposed them. Bowie says: \"There is a terrific lot of Holocaust writing and, though there are very few charlatans, American Jewish friends I talk to about this sometimes express unease about the industrialisation of memoirs. She is someone astonishingly free of all that. The person she reminds me most of is Primo Levi - she has that same quality of being able to talk very directly about things that other people shrink from or become melodramatic about. This is not exactly a literary success; it feels like being in the presence of a very powerful moral force\" </p> <p>In 1993, Hoffman finally moved to England. Ignatieff thinks the decision is a tribute to her character: \"She came to England absolutely cold, knowing hardly anyone, and made herself into a success, just as she had been in the US.\" </p> <p>But, he says, her character has stayed almost the same in the three decades he has known her. \"She has a very characteristic voice. She is steady. I like that in her. She sees what she sees very clearly, with no mucking about. She has very good political and moral judgment, which is extremely rare in highly intelligent people. It's hard to believe that anyone so warm can be so self-contained.\" </p> <p>Surely she uprooted and came to London for love. \"I wish I could say so but it's not the case. I wanted to be in Europe. There was always for me a fruitful tension about being in America, but I found I didn't want quite so much tension.\" </p> <p>At the time, she was studying psychoanalysis seriously. She had been introduced to the work of Freud in the 1980s when her reading group in New York chose one of his books. Then she was analysed in New York and in London started a training analysis, with a view to setting up in practice herself. \"I thought I would see four patients every morning and write every afternoon,\" she says, and laughs at the ambition of the plan. </p> <p>\"Her natural distinction reasserted itself and she returned to literature,\" says Foster. Yet her interest in the system remains deep: \"Psychoanalysis seems to me to use the Socratic method. It leads us out of the cave of our own ignorance.\" </p> <p>She says: \"I adore Freud.\" This is not the same as believing everything he said. But psychoanalysis, she says, has taken over many of the essential questions that used to be thought of as philosophical. It deals with the central questions of human life. Talking about the need to understand atrocities, she has said: \"Tyrants and torturers go into therapy much less frequently than their subject and victims.\" </p> <p>In her recent lecture given on behalf of Amnesty International at Oxford, she quoted a South African torturer forced to explain himself before the truth and reconciliation commission. The man expressed shame or embarrassment only once: it was not when he was confronted with his victims, but when he had to admit that he had himself consulted a psychiatrist. </p> <p>She went on to say: \"It is the victims who, in addition to the sufferings they have undergone, are left carrying the burdens of trauma and great loss. The perpetrators - especially the instigators of violence, at whose door the ultimate responsibility lies - seem to suffer such consequences much less. They may fear retribution but they continue to uphold the rightness of their conviction and to live in fair psychological health.\" </p> <p>When the camps empty, the survivors need counselling but the guards, if they get away, may live fairly happily ever after. The problem, she says, comes with the children of the guards. </p> <p>She has just finished her first novel which will be published in the autumn. She won't say much about it, except that it is set in the near future and deals with a strong mother-daughter bond. But there is a sense in which all her work has been examining a novelist's questions. </p> <p>The personal and the political are welded together in all her books and in all her characters. Her one subject is the way that the individual and society construct each other, just as the pianist and the music do. </p> <p><strong>Life at a glance</strong><br></p> <p><strong> Eva Wydra Hoffman </strong><br></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> July 1 1945, Cracow, Poland. </p> <p><strong> Emigrated: </strong> 1959, Vancouver. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> MA English literature, Rice University, Texas, 1966; Yale School of Music 1967-68; PhD, Harvard, 1974. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> Barry Hoffman,1971 (divorced 1976). </p> <p><strong> Career:</strong> Worked New York Times 1980-90; Guggenheim fellowship; Visiting professor Massachusetts Institute of Technology, present; Visiting fellow, Townsend Centre, Berkeley, 2000; Visiting fellow, Clare Hall, Cambridge University, 2001; Amnesty Lecturer, Oxford University, 2001. </p> <p><strong> Some books:</strong> Lost in Translation, 1989; Exit into History, 1993; Shtetl, 1997.</p>",

Her parents had survived the Holocaust by hiding in a bunker in the Ukrainian forest; they then hid for a further year among hay bales in an unheated barn, concealed by a mute peasant. When Hoffman was 13, the family emigrated to Vancouver without a word of English: a city on the opposite side of the world in every sense. Everything changed. Her father, Boris Wydra, was, she writes, almost overthrown by the order and predictability he found there, like a sailor whose legs betray him on the dockside. But she and her sister, Alina, who is three years younger, somehow found their balance in the New World. She gave up her ambition to be a concert pianist and, aged 19, emigrated again to Texas, before moving to New York, where she became what she had discovered she wanted to be - a metropolitan intellectual. Nowadays she lives in Hampstead, in London - \"halfway between Manhattan and Cracow\" - just down the road from the Freud museum. She commutes to her job in the US - she is visiting professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology - and has taught creative writing at the University of East Anglia. Yet this life of free-floating sophistication is rooted in her extraordinary understanding of the confined and tangle-rooted cultures of eastern Europe. Hoffman's mother, Maria, though she survived the unimaginable privations and dangers of the war, never ran or swam in her entire life. Respectable girls from a religious Jewish background could not do so. This was so ingrained that Maria Wydra did not bother to mention it until the subject came up when her daughter was 20. \"Every immigrant,\" says Eva Hoffman, \"becomes a kind of amateur anthropologist.\" Everything is strange to the eye of a stranger. What makes her extraordinary as a writer is that she can recapture the sense that life must be constantly made understandable, yet will never become familiar. This trick is most subtle when she writes about things we already think we understand: Polish anti-semitism in Shtetl, her history of a settlement on the borders of Poland and Belarus; and in Exit into History, the aftermath of the Velvet Revolutions. In both cases, she looks at the fine detail of people's lives and waits until they appear before the reader, as serious, knotty and untranslateable as we appear to ourselves. Roy Foster, professor of modern history at Oxford, says: \"She writes about ethnic or racial relations, which are sometimes treated in a very simplistic way, and she makes it clear how complicated they are.\" She understands that everyone is on someone else's periphery: when, in Shtetl, she visits the market in a small town in eastern Poland, where the Jews were exterminated, she sees: \"Ruddy-faced farmers in sheepskin coats with high leather boots . . . stomping their feet in the snow for warmth. I observe them with a double vision. They are rough-and-ready looking men, huddling in small groups, exchanging idle remarks. That is all. But in post-Holocaust ethnography, they have come to be seen as allegories of anti-semitism. In their faces, if you look at them a certain way, nothing but this essential hatred can be discerned.\" But she flips the mirror so that she shares their intolerance. \"The way, undoubtedly, that to some of them a Jew was a pure type, of greed, cleverness and manipulativeness. I know that there may be some truth to the Polish stereotype: that in some of their hearts, anti-semitism sprouts. But I also know that, on both sides, these are reductions, pure, simple and sometimes very dangerous.\" Her picture of the complexities of the Holocaust grows out of family experience. Her parents were betrayed several times by Gentile peasants to the Germans who would have killed them, as all their relatives were killed. But they also survived because of the bravery and self-sacrifice of other peasants - who would themselves have been killed had the Wydras been discovered. And Hoffman's aunt and niece were betrayed to their deaths by other Jews. This is why she is able to say: \"An injunction to remember can become an injunction not to think, not to grapple with the past: such an injunction seems to me to verge on bad faith.\" In other words, a facile and distorted memory is almost a greater insult than simply forgetting. No wonder Foster sees in her an example to be followed by everyone who writes Irish history. He likes her, too: \"She has a compelling personality. Charming would be the wrong word - but I have seen her in a long and very absorbed conversation with Isaiah Berlin [the late philosopher] the first time they met. Obviously he was a great charmer, but she was exerting her own compulsion, too, on him.\" Much of her historical writing is concerned with the intricacies of individual memory, as a guard against the blurring sweeps of collectivism. Her own memory, as revealed in the autobiographical Lost in Translation, has a most extraordinary vividness and purity. Her childhood, sealed off as it was by exile and loss of language, re-emerges in a continuous present, full of all the small anchoring details that make our surroundings real. When they reach Vancouver, she cannot believe that lavatory paper comes in different colours. In Cracow they had been happy without any of that. \"I didn't know I was economically deprived. There were so many things that are important for a child. There was a sense of community and solidarity and neighbourliness because of the terrible times that everyone had been through. The barriers were lower between people. And as a child I was not overstimulated. There was human intimacy, but also a lot of space to muse, to play and to imagine.\" In Cracow, her parents had been happy. They had lost their families, their religious faith, their trust in any institution. But they had survived. They were among people who had also suffered and were making the best of a new world; soon they emerged towards the top of the new society. The Wydras might have had only three rooms in their flat, but there was a maid who slept in the kitchen - a Jew who had been a servant in the house of the peasants who had sheltered them, though they had not known then that she was Jewish. Boris Wydra made his living hustling and trading, seldom legally - to break communist laws was a patriotic act in Poland. But he managed to accumulate enough money for his family to have a middle-class life, with restaurant meals and concerts and piano lessons for his daughters: he even obtained a Russian motorbike in 1956: the magnitude of this achievement is reflected in the fact that no one they knew owned any sort of motorised vehicle, let alone a car. The traffic on the cobbled streets consisted of trams and horse-drawn carts, \"although in the busiest parts of the city there are occasionally several cars in a row, which seem to tear by at enormous speeds\". But the real distance of this past comes out in its pictures of femininity. Her mother did not just avoid running because it was ill-bred. She also had, writes Hoffman, a peasant's \"ancient notion - which came from centuries of hard labour - that the ideal state of life is getting enough rest . . . laziness shows a certain luxuriance of character, the eroticism of valuing your pleasure. 'You know, Ormianska calls the maid from the kitchen to get her matches, which are lying 10 centimetres away from her', my mother says, half in criticism, half in admiration. Such egotism is at the heart of feminine power, which consists in the ability to make others do things for you, to be pampered.\" Her friend, the novelist Lisa Appignanesi, says: \"The Poles, like the British, have internalised an ideal aristocracy and this comes through very clearly in Eva's work. The importance given to music, the sense of being cultivated. Jews carried that as well. They carried it into the countries where they went - the women wore gloves, I mean, everyone wore gloves. My mother had, like, 100 pairs.\" Appignanesi, although another Polish Jew, whose parents emigrated to Canada when she was two, does not have Hoffman's keen sense of Polish life as a living undercurrent to all other possible ways of living. Hoffman says: \"I am interested in how we are constructed by language and by culture. There is some kind of dialectic going on, but we can never grasp what it is that engages with language.\" The great dislocation which made this process visible to her was emigration and the change of language. But after seeing it in her own life, she sees elements of the process everywhere. Her book Exit into History is really an account of how people coped with being exiled into the future at the end of the Cold War. Shtetl is in some ways an account of an emigration that never was; and of the way in which Jews and Christians were never forced to come to terms with each other as living complicated beings, in need of translation, until it was too late. They lived side by side as strangers until catastrophe overwhelmed them both. The Jews, of course, were more thoroughly overwhelmed, but though others escaped with their lives, they were still forced to flee. When Hoffman and her sister finally visited Zalosce, the small town near Lvov where their parents came from, they found three Jews living there, of whom one, she says, was a \"public\" Jew. But Jews were not the only people to have disappeared. Zalosce had in 1939, when it was part of Poland, been one third Polish, one third Ukrainian and one third Jewish. Today there are three Poles left, to go with the three Jews. Indeed, Hoffman was hardly aware of her own Jewishness until she was seven or more. Most of her Cracow childhood was unaffectedly Polish. Michael Ignatieff, who has known her for 30 years, since they were at Harvard together, says: \"She doesn't shut off any side of her. Most people who are Polish-Jewish decide to be one or the other. She has decided to be both.\" Now Hoffman sees that her father was a shtetl trader, one of a long line of Jews who had made their livings in the markets of eastern Europe for centuries. In Vancouver, he started a business selling second-hand furniture, which eventually prospered. But he never really adjusted to life in Canada. \"My father was fantastic at coping with crises and with dangerous situations and I think he was very flummoxed by the quiet orderliness of the world he came into.\" In Poland, Hoffman's recognised gifts had been musical, not literary. She was to have been a concert pianist and there is still a Bechstein grand in her Hampstead house. \"I would find it very hard to live without a piano,\" she says. \"At the moment I am reading my way through all the Beethoven sonatas, even though I have played most of them. Otherwise, I play for myself the classical Romantic repertoire - Chopin, Schumann.\" She gave up on a musical career because she felt she would never reach the top. \"There are so many peerless pianists and the repertory has been recorded at a super level 20 times over. I could have been good but I didn't think I had anything to add to that.\" Emigration disrupted her piano studies to some extent, though in Vancouver her Russian piano teacher was the first real friend she made there. At 19, she decided to go to Rice University in Texas, 2,000 miles away, to study literature. \"It was the only private university in the States which would pay my tuition fees: It was supposed to be very good. I had no larger picture. But it turned out to be a very good school. Of course, it was another planet to move to.\" As part of the difficulties of an immigrant, she points out that when taken to college football games, she never knew where the ball was. She literally could not see it. You might expect her to be puzzled by the discovery that in Canada there are bedrooms for everyone, or by the terrors and rituals of dating in the early 1960s - why would anyone try to impress a girl by taking her to a drive-in hamburger joint? But the difficulties she had at football games are more illuminating. \"I witness rituals as arcane as Aztec ceremonies - elaborate ceremonies of floodlit cheerleading, collective genuflections to a large stuffed owl, which is the university's mascot, and once a near riot which starts up when an umpire's decision provokes streams of boys from both warring camps to run down the bleachers with the full intention of attacking each other - only to be stopped dead when the Rice band strikes up the national anthem. It is their respect for the law which astonishes me as much as all their bloodlust.\" In fact, she sees almost everything on the football field except the ball. If the game makes no sense, you have no idea what the ball should be doing, nor where it might be. Hence it remained invisible to her in all her years at university in Texas. All she could see were oddly dressed men, running around shouting. Yet she persisted with arcane aspects of US culture. It is part of the promise of America that all immigrants will get there in the end. From Rice, she travelled another 1,000 miles, north to Harvard, where she took a doctorate in English, after deciding not to study music at Juilliard. She married a fellow student, changing her name from the tricky \"Wydra\" to the thoroughly American \"Hoffman\", and kept the name when she left him after seven years. He got his PhD and went into advertising, where he prospered. They had no children and she has not married again. By the time of the divorce, she had decided she had no vocation as a full-time academic. She wanted to be a New York intellectual: to be a critic of culture, not just literature and to help form the opinions of people who really mattered in New York - which, as every New Yorker knows, is the centre of the universe - as well as going to all the smart parties. But she was finding success elusive. She had, she says, none of the pain and active discrimination that earlier immigrants experienced - it is hardly a disadvantage, if you want to be a New York intellectual, to have started off as a Polish Jew. Within the limits of her ability and ambition, she could go anywhere she wanted. \"The only joke is that there's no there when you get there.\" She discovered psychoanalysis, which she took, and still takes, very seriously. Perhaps it supplied a way of trying to find that core of human personality which seems so elusive when moving from culture to culture. She worked in the features department of the New York Times, in \"ideas and trends\" and \"arts and leisure\". \"I was accompanied still at that point by a great deal of immigrant anxiety: whether anyone would want me, or would give me a job - all of that.\" A down-dragging grin stabs at the corner of her mouth when she says this. \"I started doing some essayistic, journalistic writing.\" Then she returned to Poland, to try and rediscover where she had come from and the language which once she had spoken. \"Poland had really obliged by staying really static\", she says, conscious of the irony. Her successful friends now had cars, but communism had slowed the pace of change in most of the city. She found that her past had been conveniently relocated to a foreign country a manageable plane ride away; and so she wrote Lost in Translation. It was praised enormously from the moment of publication in 1989. Czeslaw Milosz called it \"graceful and profound\", an opinion which is worth having from a man whose memoirs of his own Lithuanian-Polish childhood had helped to win him the Nobel prize. Americans seem to have taken it as a story of how one becomes a successful American; outsiders as a story of how to keep your distance from the country. Foster says: \"It is one of those books you keep on giving to people.\" What makes it astonishing for a first book in a second language is the immediate, natural tone. She has brought to writing something of the same freshness that springs from the sort of unending discipline a classical pianist needs. It comes as a shock to discover that someone who writes English with such liquid and transparent grace has a pronounced Polish-American accent. Her next book, Exit into History, was not a history of the revolutions in eastern Europe, but an examination of how particular lives had been changed by them. Some were friends of hers, but the most remarkable passages concerned former communists. The good ones tended to have been imprisoned. They had at least suffered for their beliefs, and so had their parents, at a time when communism was a faith full of hope. One story concerns a friend of Hoffman's generation who was imprisoned by the communists in 1968. Because the woman's father was a high-ranking communist, she was offered a pardon if she made an apology. Her father was allowed to visit her, and told her how he had been imprisoned as a communist by the pre-war Polish government, and had been offered an amnesty if he would disavow communism. He was then visited - the chain goes back into history - by his own father, who told him: \"As you know, I am not a communist. I don't agree with you. But as for mercy, we don't plead for it.\" So the friend knew what to do, and served her sentence out. Courage and style, Hoffman sees, have a value which quite outlasts the causes that they serve. She did not really suffer under communism. One of the reasons she did not move back to Poland, when it became possible, was that, \"My generation in Poland had such a shared experience of coming through things of history and I would be partially an outsider to that.\" None the less, her magnanimity towards the communists is astonishing. The true believers appear to her more comic than anything else, in their sudden dispossession. When they ruled the country, they were \"Them\" with a capital T. Robbed of their power, knocked down to a dismissive lower case, she still finds in the best of them some dignity. One Polish communist, aged 84, \"puts me incongruously in mind of a minor character in one of Tolstoy's novels - an outmoded Enlightenment rationalist who has outlasted his time, and who continues to putter in his private laboratory, ignoring the world which has overtaken him, performing his pointless scientific experiments with great clarity of mind and sturdy cheerfulness\". It is entirely characteristic of Hoffman to find \"sturdy cheerfulness\" a virtue in a man who had been on the side of great wickedness. She has less time for the bad communists, the ones who worked the system just because it was the system, and were just as happy to adapt to capitalism when that was called for. One was the man who had censored the films of the Polish director Krzystof Kieslowski. He believed, by the end, that he was on the side of the people he censored; that by cleverness and disdain for the rules he operated he was really helping the artists. In fact, starting from socialist realism, he had reached flawless postmodern conclusions. \"I can interpret anything in the way I want. I can make anything mean one thing and its opposite. Because, in literature, anything can mean anything.\" This man has become a publisher, where he is disgusted by the inefficiency and lack of enterprise among his colleagues in the private sector. All these things Hoffman records with a sympathy that is like the heat in August: it sinks in, resistlessly, until it permeates everything; but is qualified by an acerbic sobriety which is the flipside of Polish romanticism, so you don't feel at the end like forgiving the people she describes. It would be a kind of impertinence. The same quality informs Shtetl, her history of a small town similar to the one her parents came from. She will not yank on heartstrings, even when she has exposed them. Bowie says: \"There is a terrific lot of Holocaust writing and, though there are very few charlatans, American Jewish friends I talk to about this sometimes express unease about the industrialisation of memoirs. She is someone astonishingly free of all that. The person she reminds me most of is Primo Levi - she has that same quality of being able to talk very directly about things that other people shrink from or become melodramatic about. This is not exactly a literary success; it feels like being in the presence of a very powerful moral force\" In 1993, Hoffman finally moved to England. Ignatieff thinks the decision is a tribute to her character: \"She came to England absolutely cold, knowing hardly anyone, and made herself into a success, just as she had been in the US.\" But, he says, her character has stayed almost the same in the three decades he has known her. \"She has a very characteristic voice. She is steady. I like that in her. She sees what she sees very clearly, with no mucking about. She has very good political and moral judgment, which is extremely rare in highly intelligent people. It's hard to believe that anyone so warm can be so self-contained.\" Surely she uprooted and came to London for love. \"I wish I could say so but it's not the case. I wanted to be in Europe. There was always for me a fruitful tension about being in America, but I found I didn't want quite so much tension.\" At the time, she was studying psychoanalysis seriously. She had been introduced to the work of Freud in the 1980s when her reading group in New York chose one of his books. Then she was analysed in New York and in London started a training analysis, with a view to setting up in practice herself. \"I thought I would see four patients every morning and write every afternoon,\" she says, and laughs at the ambition of the plan. \"Her natural distinction reasserted itself and she returned to literature,\" says Foster. Yet her interest in the system remains deep: \"Psychoanalysis seems to me to use the Socratic method. It leads us out of the cave of our own ignorance.\" She says: \"I adore Freud.\" This is not the same as believing everything he said. But psychoanalysis, she says, has taken over many of the essential questions that used to be thought of as philosophical. It deals with the central questions of human life. Talking about the need to understand atrocities, she has said: \"Tyrants and torturers go into therapy much less frequently than their subject and victims.\" In her recent lecture given on behalf of Amnesty International at Oxford, she quoted a South African torturer forced to explain himself before the truth and reconciliation commission. The man expressed shame or embarrassment only once: it was not when he was confronted with his victims, but when he had to admit that he had himself consulted a psychiatrist. She went on to say: \"It is the victims who, in addition to the sufferings they have undergone, are left carrying the burdens of trauma and great loss. The perpetrators - especially the instigators of violence, at whose door the ultimate responsibility lies - seem to suffer such consequences much less. They may fear retribution but they continue to uphold the rightness of their conviction and to live in fair psychological health.\" When the camps empty, the survivors need counselling but the guards, if they get away, may live fairly happily ever after. The problem, she says, comes with the children of the guards. She has just finished her first novel which will be published in the autumn. She won't say much about it, except that it is set in the near future and deals with a strong mother-daughter bond. But there is a sense in which all her work has been examining a novelist's questions. The personal and the political are welded together in all her books and in all her characters. Her one subject is the way that the individual and society construct each other, just as the pianist and the music do. Life at a glance Eva Wydra Hoffman Born: July 1 1945, Cracow, Poland.

      "body": "<p>Georgia O'Keeffe was a woman of few words. Had verbal eloquence been her bag, doubtless she'd have talked up a storm and written screeds, since she clearly had a great deal to say and was not given to reticence or false modesty. She once remarked that she could see no reason for painting anything that might be put into any other form as well. So far as she was concerned, she would rather we looked at rather than read what she had to impart. She wasn't being dictatorial about it; \"arting\", as she called it, was just what she did best.</p> <p>When she was an old lady, she wrote that her first memory was of light; the brightness of light, of light all around. An artist's sensibility, if you like. But when you think about it, nobody on earth could make a truer statement, unless they were either born in some way insensate or had determined for reasons of squeamishness to consign their personal experience of the universal birth trauma to oblivion. The biological fact is that you get squeezed through this pulsating chamber and suddenly there's a piercing, shaft-shaped blaze of light at the end of the tunnel that envelops you as you draw your first breath. Why would anyone forget such a drama? O'Keeffe remembered, which is probably why she thought \"God\" was a woman and didn't in the least mind when people thought she was a bit crazy. Still, she retained several of her more blatant manifestations of God's uterine potencies in her private collection until the day she died, doubtless in the knowledge that the world was not quite ready for them. She was probably right. The world is rarely ready for the likes of her.</p> <p>O'Keeffe was born in 1887, the second child and first daughter of second-generation Americans, Irish on her father's side, Hungarian on her mother's. Five younger siblings, one boy and four girls, came later; seven being the average number of progeny for late-19th-century farming folk. She was not the favourite child, and she later confessed that she often craved the affection that her mother either withheld or gave elsewhere; at the same time, however, O'Keeffe appreciated that not being overly favoured gave her the freedom to find her own autonomy without undue pressures and expectations. She was lucky, too, to have been born into the strident light of Wisconsin, where very little need ever come between the mind's eye and the horizon but space, more space and the perspective of imagination. Her parents' peer group was the product of a pioneering spirit, men and women who distanced themselves from the oppressions and privations of their homelands, and who worked their socks off to create a brave new world. Reading about it, seeing it on the cinema screen, that part of American history always has a sort of Utopian edge to it. The sense of human co-operation between farming communities and members of large families, the prospect of social egalitarianism growing naturally from a life where everyone, man, woman and child must pull their weight for survival. And the whole thing held together by a simple, Episcopalian decency. </p> <p>People like the O'Keeffes gathered in their sitting rooms after dark and entertained themselves by reading aloud the heroic literature of the day, stuff that gloried in romantic individualism: The Last Of The Mohicans, life of Hannibal, Stanley's adventures in Africa, tales to transcend the cloying concerns of sexual discrimination and male chauvinism. Wisconsin was the first American state to introduce women's suffrage. You can see why. Georgia was 13 when Freud discovered the subconscious mind; older still when Jung came up with the collective unconscious. Yet these things weren't inventions; they were already there, and always have been. Some people never needed to be told about them with words.</p> <p>As she passed through childhood, Georgia experienced the longing for solitude common to members of large families. \"I don't take easily to being with people,\" she once said. Her placement in the family gave her something of an advantage in that, as the oldest girl, she was expected to mind her younger siblings, a task that exempted her from strict obedience to those above her in the pecking order. So long as she kept the kids in hand, she was her own child. So far as her vision of her future was concerned, she was stuck in a culture where girls grew up to be wives and mothers - capable, accomplished, happy, loved, admirable women, but essentially wives and mothers. The worst-case scenario would be to grow up and not find a husband, in which case you would use your capabilities and accomplishments to teach other little girls how to achieve wife and mother status for the future glory of God and America. Georgia's options were well covered in this respect. She and her sisters were given paintboxes and coloured pencils to play with, and all but one of the O'Keeffe girls displayed a facility for making pretty pictures from an early age. When she was 11, such was her evident talent, her parents paid for her to have art lessons.</p> <p>One of her earliest exercises in life class was to draw the figure of a stooping man. Always anxious to please - herself and her teachers - she did her best with the project, but was severely displeased with the result. There was, she thought, something absurdly unbalanced about her drawing. The man looked as though a puff of wind would bowl him over. She couldn't leave it alone. Then she turned her picture on its side and solved her problem. Balance restored, it was a picture of a man lying on the floor with his legs in the air. When she grew up, she said, she was going to be an artist! Children say things like that. I'm going to be a film star, an astronaut, the president. There are precedents for such ambitions, role models, possibilities - besides, you don't have to mean it. Georgia did mean it. And went on meaning it.</p> <p>In her teens, the O'Keeffes resettled in Virginia. They believed, wrongly as it turned out, that they would escape the tuberculosis that was in the process of decimating their numbers. Georgia was sent to a girls' convent school where all the budding Scarlett O'Haras were amused and a little nonplussed by the new girl's resistance to their preoccupation with the bows and frills of femininity. It was as if Georgia knew that she was female as surely as she knew that the sun would rise, and so felt no great compulsion to gild the lily of her true nature. She plaited her thick, black, Irish hair and wore plain, severe jackets over plain, severe skirts. By the time she got to art school in Chicago, she presented a quaint, androgynous exterior that, far from repelling young men, drew them to her in droves. In common with many women who feel no need to be aggressively feminine as opposed to frankly female, she posed no immediate threat to the male ego. Young men befriended her, adored her, admired her and worshipped her. </p> <p>At the same time, she was an exemplary student, an inveterate winner of prizes for technical excellence, yet the more she strove for perfection, the more constrained she felt, the further away from her dream of becoming an artist. The conflict of possibilities occupied her mind. Was she active or passive? When she agreed to pose for an art class, which in her generous way she often did, she was being passive. When she absorbed herself in her own canvas, regardless of the outcome, she was being active. She knew which she preferred. She sensed, too, that to love and be loved by a man involved a sexual commitment, a self-surrender that would effectively annihilate her creative spirit.</p> <p>There is a wonderful account in Roxana Robinson's scholarly and insightful biography of O'Keeffe of the moment when these twin oppressions, men and academic convention, combined and exploded into one unforgettable moment of truth. As a young woman she spent a lot of time in upstate New York at Lake George, wandering alone, painting landscape after landscape. One day, she was joined there by a group of friends, at least two of whom were young men with designs on her. Unknown to each other, both swains suggested to Georgia that they row across the lake to buy groceries. She accepted each invitation and the trio set off, each man failing to disguise his irritation and frustration at the presence of the other. They moored their boat, grumpily bought their groceries and returned to the mooring, only to discover that someone had stolen their boat. This meant they had to trudge all the way around the lake, toting their groceries, to get home again. It was not a pleasant trek. As they walked, Georgia looked around herself at the familiar landscape, and as she did so she realised that it had taken on a dark, brooding, gloomy aspect she had never seen before. Later, she wrote to one of her sisters about her revelation: \"How you feel affects what you see.\" And that was it. The big breakthrough. Emotional content overrides technique. \"Nothing is less real than realism,\" she said in that pragmatic yet enigmatic way of hers.</p> <p>There was still the problem of men. She was only 20 when she arrived at the Art Students' League, New York. Twenty, and beautiful in the heart-wrenching way young women can be when they haven't the faintest idea that that is what they are. Men wanted her. They wanted to take her out, dance with her, take her home to meet their mothers; they wanted to take her brush out of her hand, put her on their pedestals and paint her. They saw her work, they looked into her face and they told her she was Truth and Clarity and Purity. They said she was better than them. A higher form of life. And so she danced and posed, posed and danced for as long as it took to realise she was falling into passivity. Idealisation and idolisation are snares and delusions. Inevitably, to be the focus of such male projection makes you every bit as much of a victim as does ostracism. </p> <p>Georgia pulled herself together. She read a book, the title of which she could never recall, which must have been the 20th century's first How-To manual. From it she learned that if you want to get the best out of life, you have first to know what you actually want before you can see how to achieve it, then learn the price you have to pay for getting what you want. It made sense to her. She bought herself a little notebook, wrote \"Yes\" on the left-hand page, \"No\" on the right, and set about the scrupulous business of self-determinism on a daily basis. When she taught, it was because she had to earn her own living. The decision went in the left-hand column. She went on \"arting\".</p> <p>Her first one-woman show appeared at Alfred Stieglitz's temple of modern art, the 291 Gallery, so named for its location at that number, Fifth Avenue. It was 1917. O'Keeffe was 29. Stieglitz, for better or worse, was in love with her. Twenty years her senior, he was a married man and a father. He was probably the first photographer to bring photography into contention as an art form, a move that, despite the extraordinary quality of his work, earned him rather more kicks than ha'pence from the conventionally entrenched art world's critical establishment. He perceived himself as a sort of impresario of all that was alive and kicking, high priest of the avant-garde, promulgator of hidden talent, reaper of delicate plants - Svengali to O'Keeffe's Trilby. The immediate response to that first show essentially created a template for art critics wishing to comprehend and classify O'Keeffe for the next 70 years.</p> <p>Typical of the male-oriented reaction was one Henry Tyrrell, writing in the deeply respectable Christian Science Monitor, who found himself struggling between his frank admiration for her technical ability and some kind of personal fantasy induced by his emotional response to the content of her work. \"Miss O'Keeffe,\" he wrote, \"has found expression in delicately veiled symbolism for 'what every woman knows' but what women heretofore have kept to themselves, either instinctively or through a universal conspiracy of silence.\" He couldn't leave it alone. He goes on to build himself a fantasy about her based on nothing but his gut-reaction to her pictures, in which he concludes that her natural temperament must have been informed by loneliness, privation and suffering. She was, after all, A Woman Artist, a thing unheard of, eternally esoteric and destined for punishment, whether before or after the event.</p> <p>It was as A Woman Artist that Stieglitz successfully promoted O'Keeffe throughout the 20s and 30s. Her paintings were, and remain, inimitably female. The earth and rocks of her landscapes undulated like human flesh, her plants and flowers were uterine, labial, vulval, clitoral creatures; she was innocent as a petunia. In the early throes of her affair with Stieglitz, she allowed him to take a series of photographs of her body that made landscape of flesh much as her paintings made flesh of landscape. They also contributed tiresomely to her personal notoriety. The scandal of Mrs Stieglitz walking into her boudoir one day to discover her husband and O'Keeffe in the flagrant act of photographing and being photographed upon the matrimonial bed didn't help. Mrs S threw her husband out, bag and baggage, thus taking full responsibility for putting him exactly where he'd wanted to be for years, while Georgia, poor Georgia, was more or less morally railroaded into doing the only decent thing and marrying the fellow. </p> <p>In her Yes/No account book, she doubtless noted the price she must pay for their union, and she afforded it with good grace until the day Alfred died.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the 20s roared on in New York City. The movers and shakers found a new game to play as Freudian theories of sexual symbolism began to lap in from Europe. Old Sigmund carefully explained to his students in Vienna that the cigar he was smoking was only a cigar, nothing to get excited about, but they didn't hear him in America. The intellectually challenged went on a sort of witch-hunt for subconscious sexual symbolisms arising from repressed and perverted minds, which might, unchecked, sully the entire nation. </p> <p>Emerging from her most intense period of flower painting, O'Keeffe exhibited in New York to an audience of self-appointed Freudianists. Suddenly, the entire art establishment ganged up to bawl in unison, \"These are not phallic symbols\", as though she had committed the greatest heresy in the history of art. The phallus simply was the aesthetic shape of all that was true and beautiful in the civilised world, so much went without saying or interpreting. And this woman had gazed into the unspeakable folds of an arum lily and challenged the supremacy of the power structure that holds us all together. These were not depictions of Nature at Her most flamboyant, nor erotic images stemming from an intractably female mind-set; this was Pornography.</p> <p>O'Keeffe was pestered to defend herself and could not. She was damned if she did, damned if she didn't. Part of the Freudian doctrine suggested that to deny an accusation meant you were doubly guilty of the charge and - as in the current psychobabble - \"in denial\". </p> <p>In her gentle way, O'Keeffe remonstrated to the effect that, perhaps, people were merely presuming that what they read into her flowers was what she had written in them, and that she had done no such thing. Others reasoned that the botanical facts of, say, a wild orchid were not Miss O'Keeffe's fault and that the eye of the beholder should cease to search for a scapegoat. It all got so silly that O'Keeffe eventually refused to comment at all. \"Oh,\" she'd say when invited, \"not that rubbish.\"</p> <p>In the second half of her life, O'Keeffe found her spiritual home in the unadulterated vastness of New Mexico. She expressed her antipathy towards modernity in general and city life and male oppression in particular in a painting of a worm's eye view of skyscrapers raping an innocent night sky. Perhaps it was the cock she snooked at her detractors, as in \"How's this for phallic symbolism?\", but she was not a natural ironist and it is not her best work, bordering as it does on the merely decorative.</p> <p>The coincidence of widowhood and middle age offered her new freedom from compromise. The horizontal peacefulness of desert plains gave her the perspective she longed for, and her work somehow exchanged depth for breadth in terms of emotional content. Her fascination with rocks, stones and bones and objets trouv\u00e9s of desert wastes was one focus, the call of space and light another. As she grew older, she delighted in flying in aeroplanes, partly to travel to other spaces and lights, partly to view the horizon from a whole new vantage point. She'd touch down after a flight unable to wait to get out her easel: this time she understood how clouds behave, this time she knew how sand scintillates, this time she really, really had seen the light.</p> <p>She was famous, she was rich, she was a legend. As she turned 80, then 90, she hoped, she amused, that she might possibly make a century of herself. She had reason to believe, if she ever dwelt on such matters, that she was off the hook of prurient speculation into her supposedly aberrant erotic field-force. And then a young man came knocking on her door. Sixty years her junior, John Hamilton was a bohemian drifter, a dropout from a middle-class, educated background, a disaffected American who called himself \"Juan\" and lived by casual labour. Anyway, the 30-year-old Juan met the 90-year-old O'Keeffe and swiftly made himself indispensable to her. The solitary, ailing nonagenarian acquired muscle-power and an un-selfconscious, friendly garrison figure; the wandering boy found a use for himself, stability and the affection of a wise and rather wonderful friend. The scandalmongers didn't see it that way. They saw the ultimate in sexual aberrance, a handsome gigolo in thrall to a geriatric siren who, in photographs, now began to resemble the stubbornly defiant Big Chief Sitting Bull.</p> <p>O'Keeffe was sanguine enough with the situation to let them get on with their twittering without comment from her. Juan, silly boy, would occasionally shape up to them with specious ramblings about how it would be if he was a girl and O'Keeffe an old man, which tended to make things still muddier. \"She likes me,\" was one sensible thing he said of their friendship, \"because I never put her on a pedestal.\"</p> <p>As an artist who continued to paint well into her 80s, when failing eyesight moved her in a more sculptural direction, O'Keeffe's work developed far, far beyond those sexually explicit botanical adventures and into a deeper, more ethereal relationship with the natural world. Which is more than can be said for her more determined detractors. </p> <p>In 1946, for instance, the critic Clement Greenberg took male chauvinism to its logical conclusion in his review of the O'Keeffe retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. \"The importance of Georgia O'Keeffe's pseudo-modern art,\" he wrote, \"is almost entirely historical and symptomatic. The errors it exhibits are significant because of the time and place and context in which they were made. Otherwise her art has very little inherent value. The deftness and precision of her brush and the neatness with which she places a picture inside its frame exerts a certain inevitable charm which may explain her popularity; and some of her architectural subjects may have even more than charm - but the greatest part of her work adds up to little more than tinted photography. The lapidarian patience she has expended in trimming, breathing upon and polishing these bits of opaque cellophane betrays a concern that has less to do with art than with private worship and the embellishment of private fetishes with secret and arbitrary meaning.\"</p> <p>What Greenberg had no way of knowing, besides how to tread softly on dreams, was that O'Keeffe had another 40 years of private worship still to come and that her mark on American culture is indelible. Not that she would have minded one way or another. As she once remarked in a moment of rare loquacity, \"I see my little world as something that I am in - something that I play in. It is inevitable to me. But I never get over being surprised that it means something to anyone else.\"</p> <p> O'Keeffe's O'Keeffes: The Artist's Collection, by Barbara Buhler Lynes &amp; Russell Bowman, is published by Thames &amp; Hudson, priced \u00a329.95.

      "bodyText": "Georgia O'Keeffe was a woman of few words. Had verbal eloquence been her bag, doubtless she'd have talked up a storm and written screeds, since she clearly had a great deal to say and was not given to reticence or false modesty. She once remarked that she could see no reason for painting anything that might be put into any other form as well. So far as she was concerned, she would rather we looked at rather than read what she had to impart. She wasn't being dictatorial about it; \"arting\", as she called it, was just what she did best. When she was an old lady, she wrote that her first memory was of light; the brightness of light, of light all around. An artist's sensibility, if you like. But when you think about it, nobody on earth could make a truer statement, unless they were either born in some way insensate or had determined for reasons of squeamishness to consign their personal experience of the universal birth trauma to oblivion. The biological fact is that you get squeezed through this pulsating chamber and suddenly there's a piercing, shaft-shaped blaze of light at the end of the tunnel that envelops you as you draw your first breath. Why would anyone forget such a drama? O'Keeffe remembered, which is probably why she thought \"God\" was a woman and didn't in the least mind when people thought she was a bit crazy. Still, she retained several of her more blatant manifestations of God's uterine potencies in her private collection until the day she died, doubtless in the knowledge that the world was not quite ready for them. She was probably right. The world is rarely ready for the likes of her. O'Keeffe was born in 1887, the second child and first daughter of second-generation Americans, Irish on her father's side, Hungarian on her mother's. Five younger siblings, one boy and four girls, came later; seven being the average number of progeny for late-19th-century farming folk. She was not the favourite child, and she later confessed that she often craved the affection that her mother either withheld or gave elsewhere; at the same time, however, O'Keeffe appreciated that not being overly favoured gave her the freedom to find her own autonomy without undue pressures and expectations. She was lucky, too, to have been born into the strident light of Wisconsin, where very little need ever come between the mind's eye and the horizon but space, more space and the perspective of imagination. Her parents' peer group was the product of a pioneering spirit, men and women who distanced themselves from the oppressions and privations of their homelands, and who worked their socks off to create a brave new world. Reading about it, seeing it on the cinema screen, that part of American history always has a sort of Utopian edge to it. The sense of human co-operation between farming communities and members of large families, the prospect of social egalitarianism growing naturally from a life where everyone, man, woman and child must pull their weight for survival. And the whole thing held together by a simple, Episcopalian decency. People like the O'Keeffes gathered in their sitting rooms after dark and entertained themselves by reading aloud the heroic literature of the day, stuff that gloried in romantic individualism: The Last Of The Mohicans, life of Hannibal, Stanley's adventures in Africa, tales to transcend the cloying concerns of sexual discrimination and male chauvinism. Wisconsin was the first American state to introduce women's suffrage. You can see why. Georgia was 13 when Freud discovered the subconscious mind; older still when Jung came up with the collective unconscious. Yet these things weren't inventions; they were already there, and always have been. Some people never needed to be told about them with words. As she passed through childhood, Georgia experienced the longing for solitude common to members of large families. \"I don't take easily to being with people,\" she once said. Her placement in the family gave her something of an advantage in that, as the oldest girl, she was expected to mind her younger siblings, a task that exempted her from strict obedience to those above her in the pecking order. So long as she kept the kids in hand, she was her own child. So far as her vision of her future was concerned, she was stuck in a culture where girls grew up to be wives and mothers - capable, accomplished, happy, loved, admirable women, but essentially wives and mothers. The worst-case scenario would be to grow up and not find a husband, in which case you would use your capabilities and accomplishments to teach other little girls how to achieve wife and mother status for the future glory of God and America. Georgia's options were well covered in this respect. She and her sisters were given paintboxes and coloured pencils to play with, and all but one of the O'Keeffe girls displayed a facility for making pretty pictures from an early age. When she was 11, such was her evident talent, her parents paid for her to have art lessons. One of her earliest exercises in life class was to draw the figure of a stooping man. Always anxious to please - herself and her teachers - she did her best with the project, but was severely displeased with the result. There was, she thought, something absurdly unbalanced about her drawing. The man looked as though a puff of wind would bowl him over. She couldn't leave it alone. Then she turned her picture on its side and solved her problem. Balance restored, it was a picture of a man lying on the floor with his legs in the air. When she grew up, she said, she was going to be an artist! Children say things like that. I'm going to be a film star, an astronaut, the president. There are precedents for such ambitions, role models, possibilities - besides, you don't have to mean it. Georgia did mean it. And went on meaning it. In her teens, the O'Keeffes resettled in Virginia. They believed, wrongly as it turned out, that they would escape the tuberculosis that was in the process of decimating their numbers. Georgia was sent to a girls' convent school where all the budding Scarlett O'Haras were amused and a little nonplussed by the new girl's resistance to their preoccupation with the bows and frills of femininity. It was as if Georgia knew that she was female as surely as she knew that the sun would rise, and so felt no great compulsion to gild the lily of her true nature. She plaited her thick, black, Irish hair and wore plain, severe jackets over plain, severe skirts. By the time she got to art school in Chicago, she presented a quaint, androgynous exterior that, far from repelling young men, drew them to her in droves. In common with many women who feel no need to be aggressively feminine as opposed to frankly female, she posed no immediate threat to the male ego. Young men befriended her, adored her, admired her and worshipped her. At the same time, she was an exemplary student, an inveterate winner of prizes for technical excellence, yet the more she strove for perfection, the more constrained she felt, the further away from her dream of becoming an artist. The conflict of possibilities occupied her mind. Was she active or passive? When she agreed to pose for an art class, which in her generous way she often did, she was being passive. When she absorbed herself in her own canvas, regardless of the outcome, she was being active. She knew which she preferred. She sensed, too, that to love and be loved by a man involved a sexual commitment, a self-surrender that would effectively annihilate her creative spirit. There is a wonderful account in Roxana Robinson's scholarly and insightful biography of O'Keeffe of the moment when these twin oppressions, men and academic convention, combined and exploded into one unforgettable moment of truth. As a young woman she spent a lot of time in upstate New York at Lake George, wandering alone, painting landscape after landscape. One day, she was joined there by a group of friends, at least two of whom were young men with designs on her. Unknown to each other, both swains suggested to Georgia that they row across the lake to buy groceries. She accepted each invitation and the trio set off, each man failing to disguise his irritation and frustration at the presence of the other. They moored their boat, grumpily bought their groceries and returned to the mooring, only to discover that someone had stolen their boat. This meant they had to trudge all the way around the lake, toting their groceries, to get home again. It was not a pleasant trek. As they walked, Georgia looked around herself at the familiar landscape, and as she did so she realised that it had taken on a dark, brooding, gloomy aspect she had never seen before. Later, she wrote to one of her sisters about her revelation: \"How you feel affects what you see.\" And that was it. The big breakthrough. Emotional content overrides technique. \"Nothing is less real than realism,\" she said in that pragmatic yet enigmatic way of hers. There was still the problem of men. She was only 20 when she arrived at the Art Students' League, New York. Twenty, and beautiful in the heart-wrenching way young women can be when they haven't the faintest idea that that is what they are. Men wanted her. They wanted to take her out, dance with her, take her home to meet their mothers; they wanted to take her brush out of her hand, put her on their pedestals and paint her. They saw her work, they looked into her face and they told her she was Truth and Clarity and Purity. They said she was better than them. A higher form of life. And so she danced and posed, posed and danced for as long as it took to realise she was falling into passivity. Idealisation and idolisation are snares and delusions. Inevitably, to be the focus of such male projection makes you every bit as much of a victim as does ostracism. Georgia pulled herself together. She read a book, the title of which she could never recall, which must have been the 20th century's first How-To manual. From it she learned that if you want to get the best out of life, you have first to know what you actually want before you can see how to achieve it, then learn the price you have to pay for getting what you want. It made sense to her. She bought herself a little notebook, wrote \"Yes\" on the left-hand page, \"No\" on the right, and set about the scrupulous business of self-determinism on a daily basis. When she taught, it was because she had to earn her own living. The decision went in the left-hand column. She went on \"arting\". Her first one-woman show appeared at Alfred Stieglitz's temple of modern art, the 291 Gallery, so named for its location at that number, Fifth Avenue. It was 1917. O'Keeffe was 29. Stieglitz, for better or worse, was in love with her. Twenty years her senior, he was a married man and a father. He was probably the first photographer to bring photography into contention as an art form, a move that, despite the extraordinary quality of his work, earned him rather more kicks than ha'pence from the conventionally entrenched art world's critical establishment. He perceived himself as a sort of impresario of all that was alive and kicking, high priest of the avant-garde, promulgator of hidden talent, reaper of delicate plants - Svengali to O'Keeffe's Trilby. The immediate response to that first show essentially created a template for art critics wishing to comprehend and classify O'Keeffe for the next 70 years. Typical of the male-oriented reaction was one Henry Tyrrell, writing in the deeply respectable Christian Science Monitor, who found himself struggling between his frank admiration for her technical ability and some kind of personal fantasy induced by his emotional response to the content of her work. \"Miss O'Keeffe,\" he wrote, \"has found expression in delicately veiled symbolism for 'what every woman knows' but what women heretofore have kept to themselves, either instinctively or through a universal conspiracy of silence.\" He couldn't leave it alone. He goes on to build himself a fantasy about her based on nothing but his gut-reaction to her pictures, in which he concludes that her natural temperament must have been informed by loneliness, privation and suffering. She was, after all, A Woman Artist, a thing unheard of, eternally esoteric and destined for punishment, whether before or after the event. It was as A Woman Artist that Stieglitz successfully promoted O'Keeffe throughout the 20s and 30s. Her paintings were, and remain, inimitably female. The earth and rocks of her landscapes undulated like human flesh, her plants and flowers were uterine, labial, vulval, clitoral creatures; she was innocent as a petunia. In the early throes of her affair with Stieglitz, she allowed him to take a series of photographs of her body that made landscape of flesh much as her paintings made flesh of landscape. They also contributed tiresomely to her personal notoriety. The scandal of Mrs Stieglitz walking into her boudoir one day to discover her husband and O'Keeffe in the flagrant act of photographing and being photographed upon the matrimonial bed didn't help. Mrs S threw her husband out, bag and baggage, thus taking full responsibility for putting him exactly where he'd wanted to be for years, while Georgia, poor Georgia, was more or less morally railroaded into doing the only decent thing and marrying the fellow. In her Yes/No account book, she doubtless noted the price she must pay for their union, and she afforded it with good grace until the day Alfred died. Meanwhile, the 20s roared on in New York City. The movers and shakers found a new game to play as Freudian theories of sexual symbolism began to lap in from Europe. Old Sigmund carefully explained to his students in Vienna that the cigar he was smoking was only a cigar, nothing to get excited about, but they didn't hear him in America. The intellectually challenged went on a sort of witch-hunt for subconscious sexual symbolisms arising from repressed and perverted minds, which might, unchecked, sully the entire nation. Emerging from her most intense period of flower painting, O'Keeffe exhibited in New York to an audience of self-appointed Freudianists. Suddenly, the entire art establishment ganged up to bawl in unison, \"These are not phallic symbols\", as though she had committed the greatest heresy in the history of art. The phallus simply was the aesthetic shape of all that was true and beautiful in the civilised world, so much went without saying or interpreting. And this woman had gazed into the unspeakable folds of an arum lily and challenged the supremacy of the power structure that holds us all together. These were not depictions of Nature at Her most flamboyant, nor erotic images stemming from an intractably female mind-set; this was Pornography. O'Keeffe was pestered to defend herself and could not. She was damned if she did, damned if she didn't. Part of the Freudian doctrine suggested that to deny an accusation meant you were doubly guilty of the charge and - as in the current psychobabble - \"in denial\". In her gentle way, O'Keeffe remonstrated to the effect that, perhaps, people were merely presuming that what they read into her flowers was what she had written in them, and that she had done no such thing. Others reasoned that the botanical facts of, say, a wild orchid were not Miss O'Keeffe's fault and that the eye of the beholder should cease to search for a scapegoat. It all got so silly that O'Keeffe eventually refused to comment at all. \"Oh,\" she'd say when invited, \"not that rubbish.\" In the second half of her life, O'Keeffe found her spiritual home in the unadulterated vastness of New Mexico. She expressed her antipathy towards modernity in general and city life and male oppression in particular in a painting of a worm's eye view of skyscrapers raping an innocent night sky. Perhaps it was the cock she snooked at her detractors, as in \"How's this for phallic symbolism?\", but she was not a natural ironist and it is not her best work, bordering as it does on the merely decorative. The coincidence of widowhood and middle age offered her new freedom from compromise. The horizontal peacefulness of desert plains gave her the perspective she longed for, and her work somehow exchanged depth for breadth in terms of emotional content. Her fascination with rocks, stones and bones and objets trouv\u00e9s of desert wastes was one focus, the call of space and light another. As she grew older, she delighted in flying in aeroplanes, partly to travel to other spaces and lights, partly to view the horizon from a whole new vantage point. She'd touch down after a flight unable to wait to get out her easel: this time she understood how clouds behave, this time she knew how sand scintillates, this time she really, really had seen the light. She was famous, she was rich, she was a legend. As she turned 80, then 90, she hoped, she amused, that she might possibly make a century of herself. She had reason to believe, if she ever dwelt on such matters, that she was off the hook of prurient speculation into her supposedly aberrant erotic field-force. And then a young man came knocking on her door. Sixty years her junior, John Hamilton was a bohemian drifter, a dropout from a middle-class, educated background, a disaffected American who called himself \"Juan\" and lived by casual labour. Anyway, the 30-year-old Juan met the 90-year-old O'Keeffe and swiftly made himself indispensable to her. The solitary, ailing nonagenarian acquired muscle-power and an un-selfconscious, friendly garrison figure; the wandering boy found a use for himself, stability and the affection of a wise and rather wonderful friend. The scandalmongers didn't see it that way. They saw the ultimate in sexual aberrance, a handsome gigolo in thrall to a geriatric siren who, in photographs, now began to resemble the stubbornly defiant Big Chief Sitting Bull. O'Keeffe was sanguine enough with the situation to let them get on with their twittering without comment from her. Juan, silly boy, would occasionally shape up to them with specious ramblings about how it would be if he was a girl and O'Keeffe an old man, which tended to make things still muddier. \"She likes me,\" was one sensible thing he said of their friendship, \"because I never put her on a pedestal.\" As an artist who continued to paint well into her 80s, when failing eyesight moved her in a more sculptural direction, O'Keeffe's work developed far, far beyond those sexually explicit botanical adventures and into a deeper, more ethereal relationship with the natural world. Which is more than can be said for her more determined detractors. In 1946, for instance, the critic Clement Greenberg took male chauvinism to its logical conclusion in his review of the O'Keeffe retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. \"The importance of Georgia O'Keeffe's pseudo-modern art,\" he wrote, \"is almost entirely historical and symptomatic. The errors it exhibits are significant because of the time and place and context in which they were made. Otherwise her art has very little inherent value. The deftness and precision of her brush and the neatness with which she places a picture inside its frame exerts a certain inevitable charm which may explain her popularity; and some of her architectural subjects may have even more than charm - but the greatest part of her work adds up to little more than tinted photography. The lapidarian patience she has expended in trimming, breathing upon and polishing these bits of opaque cellophane betrays a concern that has less to do with art than with private worship and the embellishment of private fetishes with secret and arbitrary meaning.\" What Greenberg had no way of knowing, besides how to tread softly on dreams, was that O'Keeffe had another 40 years of private worship still to come and that her mark on American culture is indelible. Not that she would have minded one way or another. As she once remarked in a moment of rare loquacity, \"I see my little world as something that I am in - something that I play in. It is inevitable to me. But I never get over being surprised that it means something to anyone else.\" O'Keeffe's O'Keeffes: The Artist's Collection, by Barbara Buhler Lynes &amp; Russell Bowman, is published by Thames &amp; Hudson, priced \u00a329.95.

Her father, a pagan Portuguese ruler, found a Sicilian king to take her off his hands. But Uncumber wasn't like the other girls. Her mother was a Christian, and the daughter wanted to stay a virgin: power politics collided with the sage and serious business of chastity. But Uncumber, the Morrissey of her age, knew that the advertised absence of sex was a powerful weapon. And so she grew a beard.

Militant Teresa of the same town would have known of Paula as a role model - the local girl kept good or, at any rate, chaste.

It also rejects the idea that there is some other half waiting in the wings to make complete that which is divided and forlorn. Therein lies its appeal, its power and its offence: it can both empower the self and wither it. Un-sex can be sexy too - and not just through the promise of gratification deferred. </p> <p>Italian castrati made themselves eunuchs both for art's sake and for jobs in baroque Rome. But these fundamentalist celibates were only the latest in a long line linking sexual denial with power display. The first eunuchs are seen in the courts of ancient Persia and recur in both Byzantium and the Forbidden City. Those without families proved more loyal to rulers than men who dallied with the hope of establishing dynasties for their progeny. </p> <p>Is celibacy creative? The ideology of spermatic economy insists that it is, maintaining that no drop may be spilt if greatness is to be achieved. The Greeks called the penis \"the necessity\"- and most of us are the heirs of Hellas in this regard. But their medicine men, such as Pythagoras and Galen, thought that there was only so much of the stuff around, so it was best to look after it. When Balzac groaned post-coitally \"there goes another novel\", he was subscribing to an old code. </p> <p>The gods of the field incline with the solitaries of the study. Peruvian soccer fans still blame their 1982 World Cup loss to Poland on those players who broke the ban on pre-match sex. Indian wrestlers, the pahalwans , are life-long celibates as well as full-time sportsmen and get in a terrible state over the tiniest nocturnal emission. For Hinduism, also the sexiest of religions, agrees with Galen that semen is the essence of life. Hence the \"langot\", a G-string trussing the wrestlers' genitalia up between their legs. Happily, the players' regular hashish consumption may ease this particular pain. But the changing-room authorities seem to be evolving: Glenn Hoddle listened to the spirits and allowed England players their girlfriends during the 1998 World Cup. </p> <p>Celibacy can be just misery. Newton went on an 18-month depressive rebound from a 23-year-old Swiss. Deprived of dishy Fatio, who sensibly refused to move to Cambridge, Newton lost his early creativity. As Master of the Royal Mint, he displayed a rather anal concern with guarding the nation's currency and prosecuted counterfeiters with unwonted savagery. But Gandhi showed all the manipulativeness of a Middle Temple lawyer in using celibacy as a way of testing himself and of teasing the teenage girls, whom he alternately slept with and dispatched back to the village. For the Mahatma, sex meant always having to say sorry. One memory haunted him - that of seizing a brief session with his wife and thereby missing the death of his terminally ill father. </p> <p>Elizabeth Abbott mixes anthropology with history in her confection of insights. We discover Athenian women going on a three-day binge every autumn, gleefully burying models of male genitalia. Here also are rich Babylonian women going one further and creating life-long communities of celibates who ran their own estates and traded in silver; Aztec aristocratic males with pierced penises preserved from contact; the Enga society in New Guinea, whose bachelors are fined a pig for mentioning sex in conversation. The pages of Abbott's lucid, exciting book throb with both life and its denial. </p> <p>The emphasis is on the feminist-liberal-Christian end of things. Joan of Arc - whose sin was her cross-dressing - is a particular heroine, as is that crazed and cross 12th-century power-broker (as well as literary and musical genius), Abbess Hildegard of Bingen. What Abbott has done, in effect, is to write a history of civilisation from one particular angle, gliding through world civilisations with a compelling ease. There is plenty of anecdotage along the way to ease the journey. There is anger too - as in the account of Chinese foot-binding, where fashion statements colluded with masculine control as tiny feet were sucked, nibbled and stroked for more than 1,000 years until the official prohibition in 1906. Clerical celibacy comes in for some special anger, with Abbott's focus on the treatment of the 1970s \"Third Way\" movement, full of sophistry, as such movements tend to be: nuns and priests were allowed to date, neck and pet without sex. But it is a strength of her moving and dazzling achievement that Abbott is never conventional, preachy or platitudinous. Like all good history, her book is a signpost to the strangeness of a world that has such deviance in it.</p>",

We immediately started painting caves and worshipping gods, and became rational. The question is: what could have caused this abrupt change? </p> <p>Well, here is a suggestion to wet your socks: the first humans were schizophrenic. A small band of smart apes lived by a lakeshore in east Africa on a diet rich in fats, which allowed their brains to grow very large. Then a genetic defect in fat metabolism led to one child having faulty brain connections; the signalling became slightly variable. The result was a brain prone to schizophrenia, psychopathy and mania, but also creativity, curiosity and ambition. As David Horrobin imagines it, this child with \"a divine discontent with the way things were\" spawned a family of proto-Medicis, brilliant and ruthless, who slaughtered their neighbours and spread out to rule the world. </p> <p>Then comes a second part to the story. The founding of civilisation resulted in another big change in diet, initially to farmed grains and later to the high animal-fat consumption of modern times. Thus those individuals with schizoid genes (who tended to form the ruling classes) were no longer getting the right fats, so their brain-wiring really did start to go wrong. No longer were they simply touched with a little creative madness, but they had to be locked up in asylums. And guess what?

Horrobin's life story is a tale in itself. He was a professor of medicine researching the role of essential fatty acids in human health when a sudden revelation led to the schizophrenia theory, which he published in 1979. Thunderstruck to find that no one was interested, he started his own drugs company, whose first big product was evening primrose oil - a fatty-acid treatment now used to treat ailments as wide-ranging as premenstrual syndrome, multiple sclerosis and eczema. He now has a new start-up with a new range of diseases in his sights. </p> <p>So is his book just advertising for a coming range of fish-oil treatments? Well, if the capsules work as well as he claims, the world will be beating a path to his door anyway. What he really wants to do is to shake up the staid thought processes of conventional science. </p> <p>His book is brightly written and certainly deserves to be read. But it is one thing to claim that schizophrenia is a legacy of our hominid heritage, and quite another to say it was the essential spark that made us human. The truth is that the schizophrenic brain makes disorganised connections, not creative ones. And Horrobin barely mentions the more usual explanation for what made Homo sapiens different - the evolution of grammatical speech and the highly organised thinking that goes with it. Instead, his contrary streak leads him always to shun the obvious and see an adaptive advantage when things go wrong. So, dyslexia was the crucial step needed to produce a few skilled tool-makers in each tribe; psychopathology created a pioneering spirit; a tendency towards paranoia was essential for intricate patterns of thought. His revisionism makes exciting reading, but clouds the issue of how the brain actually functions. </p> <p>The book also has a huge hole in its central premise. Horrobin never spells out how a faulty fat metabolism could change the connectivity of a schizophrenic brain.

Here, in the judgment of the critic Theodor Adorno, events of such magnitude and vileness occurred that afterwards there could be no more painting or poetry, no culture, no art. \"Alle Kultur nach Auschwitz . . . ist M\u00fcll\" - trash. Enduring Creation is, in part, Spivey's attempt to argue art free from its supposed terminus in the final solution - to show how it retains, in spite of the extravagance of our crimes, the power to civilise. </p> <p>After such a charged and somewhat self-conscious beginning (but then, how do you write about visiting Auschwitz?), the book assumes a more settled and scholarly manner with the consideration of a masterpiece of the classical world, the sculpture of the Trojan priest Laocoon (he who was wary of Greeks bearing gifts). Spivey describes this work, fashioned by unknown hands between 2BC and AD1, as \"the prototypical icon of human agony\". Condemned by Apollo, the priest stretches out in a perfection of well-muscled torment that post-classical admirers have saluted as an exemplary depiction of heroic suffering and endurance intended, surely, to conjure in the observer an ennobling sense of pity. Yet to a contemporary audience, the piece may have been not an incitement to pathos but a satisfying illustration of how the gods justly punish the impiety of mortals. There was a shrine to pity in classical Athens, but it was, apparently, a small one. Plato thought that pity sullied reason. </p> <p>Whatever the sculpture may have meant to its first audience, the outlines of the priest's agony were to reappear in the work of numerous Renaissance painters (the sculpture was excavated at Rome in 1506). Now, however, the context is thoroughly Christian. Suffering has moved on; suffering is victory. These paintings served as props to faith: educative, inspirational, the focuses of veneration in churches and chapter houses across Europe. Spivey devotes half the book to the contemplation of Christian art, from the earliest crucifixion pieces - the cross was unseen for 500 years after the death of Christ - to the myriad depictions of martyrdom (roastings, disembowelments, mutilations, stonings, impalements etc), and finally to a comparison of the many versions of that biblical spine-tingler, the massacre of the innocents. Guido Reni, Raphael, Tintoretto and Nicolas Poussin all painted versions of the fabled slaughter, Poussin's canvas having, according to Francis Bacon, the best scream ever painted. But it is Brueghel's version (circa 1566), set in a contemporary Netherlands with soldiers garbed as Spanish halberdiers, that seems, with its air of mingled violence and normality, the most unnerving, the most likely. </p> <p>One 17th-century owner of a Brueghel \"massacre\" canvas had the more upsetting parts painted out: some things we don't want to look at. How realistic, how blunt, should an artist allow himself to be in the depiction of what is most disturbing? Spivey relates how in the 19th century Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault observed wasted bodies in Paris hospitals and filled his studio with the limbs of executed criminals in an attempt to bring authenticity to his epic The Raft of the Medusa , a painting of the survivors of a shipwreck off the west coast of Africa. Displayed in the Paris Salon, it was dismissed by one critic as \"a work for the delight of vultures\". </p> <p>On the other side of the Pyrenees, a court painter was busy pushing back the boundaries of the drawable, though on a more intimate scale. Unfettered by considerations of public exhibition, Francisco de Goya sketched the realities of the Peninsular war in a series known as The Disasters of War . He did not directly witness all that he set down in his sketchbooks (those horrors he did see are marked \" Yo lo vi \"), but the authenticity of his work as a record of what people performed upon each other in that protracted conflict is not in doubt. In private work, of course, the question of what such images were intended to provoke is redundant: artists, contrary to popular belief, are not necessarily interested in communicating anything at all. The etchings are a record of the times. Such things occurred. Why would an artist of Goya's energy and honesty avoid such subjects? </p> <p>In our own age, news footage and photojournalism have given us a certain casual, second-hand familiarity with the disasters of war. Spivey has interesting material on the early war photographers such as Roger Fenton, who was sent to the Crimea in 1855 with strict instructions to take no pictures of dead or wounded men, but who nonetheless conveyed something of the grimness of the campaign through barren, cannonball-strewn landscapes, photographs \"rendered elegiac by understatement\". No such restraint can be found in the work of Fenton's counterpart in north America: Mathew Brady's civil-war photos are as explicit as anything we have been fed more recently from Bosnia or Kosovo. They are a bold effort to show what had not generally been seen other than by those caught directly in the rip-path of fighting: the real character of a war, how inglorious it is, and how sad. </p> <p>But there is a problem here; Spivey, \"the bewildered liberal soul\", is uneasy.

      "bodyText": "Enduring Creation: Art, Pain and Fortitude Nigel Spivey 272pp, Thames &amp; Hudson, \u00a324.95 Buy it at a discount at BOL Nigel Spivey's ambitious study of the relationship between suffering and its depiction in art opens with a visit by the author to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camps. Here, in the judgment of the critic Theodor Adorno, events of such magnitude and vileness occurred that afterwards there could be no more painting or poetry, no culture, no art. \"Alle Kultur nach Auschwitz . . . ist M\u00fcll\" - trash. Enduring Creation is, in part, Spivey's attempt to argue art free from its supposed terminus in the final solution - to show how it retains, in spite of the extravagance of our crimes, the power to civilise. After such a charged and somewhat self-conscious beginning (but then, how do you write about visiting Auschwitz?), the book assumes a more settled and scholarly manner with the consideration of a masterpiece of the classical world, the sculpture of the Trojan priest Laocoon (he who was wary of Greeks bearing gifts). Spivey describes this work, fashioned by unknown hands between 2BC and AD1, as \"the prototypical icon of human agony\". Condemned by Apollo, the priest stretches out in a perfection of well-muscled torment that post-classical admirers have saluted as an exemplary depiction of heroic suffering and endurance intended, surely, to conjure in the observer an ennobling sense of pity. Yet to a contemporary audience, the piece may have been not an incitement to pathos but a satisfying illustration of how the gods justly punish the impiety of mortals. There was a shrine to pity in classical Athens, but it was, apparently, a small one. Plato thought that pity sullied reason. Whatever the sculpture may have meant to its first audience, the outlines of the priest's agony were to reappear in the work of numerous Renaissance painters (the sculpture was excavated at Rome in 1506). Now, however, the context is thoroughly Christian. Suffering has moved on; suffering is victory. These paintings served as props to faith: educative, inspirational, the focuses of veneration in churches and chapter houses across Europe. Spivey devotes half the book to the contemplation of Christian art, from the earliest crucifixion pieces - the cross was unseen for 500 years after the death of Christ - to the myriad depictions of martyrdom (roastings, disembowelments, mutilations, stonings, impalements etc), and finally to a comparison of the many versions of that biblical spine-tingler, the massacre of the innocents. Guido Reni, Raphael, Tintoretto and Nicolas Poussin all painted versions of the fabled slaughter, Poussin's canvas having, according to Francis Bacon, the best scream ever painted. But it is Brueghel's version (circa 1566), set in a contemporary Netherlands with soldiers garbed as Spanish halberdiers, that seems, with its air of mingled violence and normality, the most unnerving, the most likely. One 17th-century owner of a Brueghel \"massacre\" canvas had the more upsetting parts painted out: some things we don't want to look at. How realistic, how blunt, should an artist allow himself to be in the depiction of what is most disturbing? Spivey relates how in the 19th century Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault observed wasted bodies in Paris hospitals and filled his studio with the limbs of executed criminals in an attempt to bring authenticity to his epic The Raft of the Medusa , a painting of the survivors of a shipwreck off the west coast of Africa. Displayed in the Paris Salon, it was dismissed by one critic as \"a work for the delight of vultures\". On the other side of the Pyrenees, a court painter was busy pushing back the boundaries of the drawable, though on a more intimate scale. Unfettered by considerations of public exhibition, Francisco de Goya sketched the realities of the Peninsular war in a series known as The Disasters of War . He did not directly witness all that he set down in his sketchbooks (those horrors he did see are marked \" Yo lo vi \"), but the authenticity of his work as a record of what people performed upon each other in that protracted conflict is not in doubt. In private work, of course, the question of what such images were intended to provoke is redundant: artists, contrary to popular belief, are not necessarily interested in communicating anything at all. The etchings are a record of the times. Such things occurred. Why would an artist of Goya's energy and honesty avoid such subjects? In our own age, news footage and photojournalism have given us a certain casual, second-hand familiarity with the disasters of war. Spivey has interesting material on the early war photographers such as Roger Fenton, who was sent to the Crimea in 1855 with strict instructions to take no pictures of dead or wounded men, but who nonetheless conveyed something of the grimness of the campaign through barren, cannonball-strewn landscapes, photographs \"rendered elegiac by understatement\". No such restraint can be found in the work of Fenton's counterpart in north America: Mathew Brady's civil-war photos are as explicit as anything we have been fed more recently from Bosnia or Kosovo. They are a bold effort to show what had not generally been seen other than by those caught directly in the rip-path of fighting: the real character of a war, how inglorious it is, and how sad. But there is a problem here; Spivey, \"the bewildered liberal soul\", is uneasy. How pure is our regard of these images? Is it all noble pathos, the pictures instructing us in right perception, helping us, through some mysterious transaction, to be larger, sweeter people? What is the full character of our reaction to Brueghel's Massacre of the Innocents , or Singer Sargent's 1919 depiction of gassed soldiers on the western front, or, God help us, the anonymous pictures of crumpled, frightened families arriving at Auschwitz to a fate of which they were still ignorant, but which we know? There must, of course, be some clinical insight, and Freud provides something of the kind in his essay published after the first world war, \" Das Unheimliche \" (The Unhomely), in which he considers the curious and persistent human desire to entertain ourselves with the sensation of fear. Repression, he argues, makes the direct contemplation of our deaths impossible for us, so we peep at mortality in, for example, the nightmare canvases of Fuseli or the novels of P D James.

She built it into one of Latin America's most admired arts institutions, with a collection that includes major works by Picasso, Braque, Botero, Bacon, Chagall, Kandinsky and Rauschenberg. But somewhere along the line she fell foul of Chavez, a left-wing populist who took power in 1999 with ideas of his own about the proper role of the arts. </p> <p>\"Culture has become elitist as a result of being managed by elites,\" he complained in January on a weekly radio programme he hosts. \"Princes, kings, heirs, families took over institutions, institutions that have cost the state millions and millions.

But that term has generated apprehension, especially in view of Chavez's declaration: \"I am a Maoist\", made during the visit this month of President Jiang Zemin of China. </p> <p> Last year, Chavez appointed Manuel Espinoza, 64, a former Communist party member and painter, as director of the country's national council of culture. </p> <p>In an interview, Espinoza said that Chavez's summons to a \"cultural revolution\" should be no cause for alarm. \"It is a mistake to tie a word to a particular historical experience,\" he said. \"Revolutions are not defined just by China's deplorable experience, and if you look up the word in the dictionary you will find no reference to China there. What we want is a transformation, a rapid change that liberates the creative potential of all the people.\" </p> <p>As part of that process, Espinoza said that the government had begun building community cultural centres in rural and provincial areas. The government's cultural budget is also being increased by more than $100m (\u00a369.5m), twice as much as under the previous government. </p> <p>But \"redefining culture,\" as Espinoza calls it, also involves shifting the focus away from the fine arts toward artisanship and other forms of expression with a practical political purpose. \"It is necessary for the state to stimulate the creative powers of the people so as to encourage their participation in the process of social mobilisation and integration,\" he says. </p> <p>Little is known about Chavez's tastes in the arts, other than his habit of singing folk songs or quoting the poetry of Walt Whitman during his speeches, but his views on the relationship between politics and culture could not be clearer. </p> <p>\"Culture needs to be at the service of development, not at the service of elites which have led a distorted cultural process,\" he said in a recent speech. Speaking of his government and its policies, he said he aspired to \"a culture that is at the service of the human revolution, of creation, of the liberation of the Venezuelan people\". </p> <p>Chavez's purge has affected all 36 government cultural institutions, from museums and orchestras to theatre groups and the state publishing house, Espinoza says. But the ousting of Imber as the head of a museum that added her name to its title a decade ago in homage to her work is seen by Chavez's critics as emblematic of the increasingly sectarian nature of the revolutionary process. </p> <p>\"I think this museum is not to their liking because they only want art that is nationalistic and patriotic,\" says Imber, who was born in Russia and came to Venezuela as a child. \"In a certain way, they are right when they say that the art at my museum is elite and cosmopolitan, because I have always believed that when you give people something good, something that elevates their taste, they like it.\" </p> <p>But under Imber's stewardship, the museum has also run programmes to take art to the city's slums and to bring poor children to the museum for art classes. In addition, admission to the museum, as it is to most cultural institutions in Venezuela, is free - a legacy of the oil boom of the 1970s, which led to lavish government spending on the arts. </p> <p>Imber's work at the museum and her efforts to promote 20th-century Latin American and Spanish art made her an important cultural figure throughout the continent. Several foreign governments have awarded her medals, and in 1998 she won Unesco's Picasso prize. </p> <p>\"This is a world-class museum with a first-class collection that she assembled. Plus it's well managed, beautifully installed and has a great reputation,\" says William H Luers, a former US ambassador to Venezuela and a former president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. \"It's due to her, and everyone knows it, which makes it a national outrage that she should be dispensed with so unceremoniously.\" </p> <p>Imber has been an outspoken critic of Chavez and is the widow of Carlos Rangel, a political writer who was an adversary of many of the Marxist theorists who have risen to power with Chavez. But Espinoza denies that politics or personal revenge were factors in Imber's dismissal, saying that her ousting was part of \"a natural process of renovation and renewal\" intended to end what he described as a stagnation of culture. </p> <p>\"I am a personal friend of Sofia's and I continue to admire and esteem her,\" he says. \"But I am absolutely convinced that to preserve and guarantee her work, it was necessary to replace her.\" </p> <p>Imber's successor as director of the museum is Rita Salvestrini, one of her former deputies. Salvestrini says the museum must \"reflect the will of the state, not of a single person\" and indicated that her management and collection philosophy will be different from that of her predecessor. </p> <p>\"I must say that I do not know why there has been such an emphasis over the past decade on acquiring 20th-century Spanish art, some of it by minor names. If you try to find a Latin American artist, you will find Botero but no one else, so I think the correct path is to fill that vacuum and open more toward Latin American art.\" </p> <p>Salvestrini's approach dovetails with Chavez's attacks on what he calls the political and cultural hegemony of the United States and Europe and his constant calls for pan-Latin American unity, or Bolivarianismo , as he labels it. Salvestrini also talks of strengthening the museum's website (<a href=\"http://www.maccsi.org.ve\">www.maccsi.org.ve</a>) to make art more accessible to ordinary Venezuelans. \"We need to communicate more effectively to shed an elitist image,\" she says. \"If you look at the attendance figures, you will see that they have dropped dramatically in recent years, to a level I find worrisome.\" </p> <p>But others in the art world say it is the apparent application of overtly ideological criteria that makes them uneasy. \"I'm scared by this stuff, this utilitarian approach to culture, which just kills art,\" says Luers, who is now chairman of the United Nations Association.

      "body": "<p>As May Day approaches, warnings have grown louder about impending riots in the capital. Where will they be? Two years ago it was the City, last year Westminster and Whitehall. This year the rumours - fuelled by internet announcements by would-be protesters - point to that canyon of Mammon, Oxford Street. \"Mayhem\" (the favoured word in the popular press), it seems, is to be the order of the day. Stores are said to be hiring extra security staff; litter bins will be removed so that they cannot serve as missiles. Particular outlets that have been singled out for attention are Starbucks, Gap and, predictably, McDonald's. </p> <p>The idea of agitators giving prior notice of their intended targets might seem odd, but Britain has a long tradition of riots and, down the centuries, mobs have often made their intended targets clear in advance. Protesters have realised that the anticipation of a riot can be as disruptive as any actual assault on property, and riots are more often remembered for their targets than for their causes. </p> <p>While the May Day protests are a relatively new phenomenon, they share many of the historical protocols of the British riot. The disturbances in Elizabethan and Jacobean England, for example, especially those directed against the enclosure of common land, frequently took place on traditional holidays. The rioters would throw down the fences erected to deny access to land on which they had once been allowed to graze their animals, demonstrate their contempt for the landowner (occasionally by surrounding his house or burning him in effigy) - and then would dutifully return to work the next day. Holidays were used for the brief expression of a long-nursed discontent. Nearly 500 years ago, on May 1 1517, riots were directed against the property of affluent foreign merchants and craftsmen plying their trades in London. These became known as the \"Evil May Day\" riots. </p> <p>The idea of targeting buildings that stand for conspicuous consumption, too, is an old one. The peasants' revolt of 1381 saw ferocious disturbances in London, and what was called \"luxury\" was one of its targets. Various palaces and grand houses were attacked; Lambeth Palace, the home of the Archbishop of Canterbury, was sacked - not because he was head of the church, but because it was his seat of opulence. At the height of the riot, the Savoy Palace, the most magnificent private mansion in England, was systematically demolished. The Savoy was the huge riverside home of John of Gaunt, Richard II's uncle and the nation's power broker. Standing on what is now the Strand, it was famous for its owner's magnificent collection of furniture, tapestries, jewels and ornaments. The rioters, who blamed John of Gaunt for the introduction of the poll tax that had detonated the revolt, destroyed everything. What could not be smashed or burned was thrown into the river. Jewellery was pulverised with hammers, and it was said that one rioter found by his fellows to have kept a silver goblet for himself was killed for doing so. </p> <p>Looting, however, has rarely been controlled so strictly by protesters. Before the 19th century, food riots, usually set off by price rises, often led to the looting of warehouses, and occasionally even of ships carrying food for export. Those who wished to mock the political radicals behind the so-called Pall Mall riots of 1886, which arose from a socialist demonstration against government policies, were quick to publicise the rioters' thefts from St James's vintners. These campaigners for a new social order, unable to resist the temptations on offer, had drunk the finest brandy from their cupped hands. </p> <p>More recently, we have become familiar with the idea that, when property is attacked, rage can give way to acquisitiveness - even if the rioters have initially been infuriated by the acquisitiveness of others. Still vivid in the memory are the images of the Brixton riots of 1981. When police retreated, local shops were attacked and political symbolism was undermined as TV viewers watched rioters stumbling up Brixton Hill clutching 26-inch television sets. </p> <p>Until the 20th century, the most frequent targets for urban agitators were prisons and places of religious worship. After the restoration of Charles II in 1660, \"loyal\" crowds attacked the meeting-houses of Quakers, who, although peace-loving, were associated with Cromwell's commonwealthmen. </p> <p> In the so-called \"Sacheverell riots\" of 1710 and 1715 (named after the rioters' hero, a High Church preacher), the places of worship of Dissenters, such as Presbyterians, were attacked, some burned down. (These disturbances led to the passing of the Riot Act, the reading of which we still talk of.) In the Gordon riots of 1780 - London's longest-lasting and perhaps most terrifying riots - Catholic chapels in London and Bath were pulled down. </p> <p>When the protesters in the peasants' revolt arrived in London after their march from Kent, they first broke open the two prisons in Southwark, King's Bench and Marshalsea, and let loose their captives. They then crossed the river and did the same to Fleet and Newgate. The latter was also famously stormed during the Gordon riotsestrictions placed on Catholics. Newgate, which had just been grandly rebuilt, bore the brunt of the rioters' fury. </p> <p>The poet George Crabbe was an eyewitness to these events and \"never saw anything so dreadful\". He graphically described how the crowd tore holes in the prison's roof, from which captives appeared as silhouettes against the flames. The event is also commemorated in Dickens's imagining of the scene in his novel Barnaby Rudge. Dickens wrote that he progress of the escaping prisoners up Holborn \"was proclaimed to those citizens who were shut up in their houses, by the rattling of their chains, which formed a dismal concert, and was heard in every direction, as though so many forges were at work\". </p> <p>Another riotous storming of a prison was also immortalised by a 19th-century novel, Walter Scott's The Heart of Midlothian. This described the assault by an enraged crowd on Edinburgh's Tollbooth prison (the Heart of Midlothian of the title). This was during the so-called \"Porteous riots\" of 1736, when John Porteous, an English captain of the city guard who was held responsible for firing on a crowd at an earlier demonstration, was dragged from the prison and hanged. The original disorder had arisen after government attempts to crack down on smuggling and the evasion of excise duty, regarded by many as practices hallowed by custom. Scott deplored all civil disorder in his own day, but in his novel treats the lynch mob with notable sympathy. </p> <p>Probably the most famous historical image of violent protest is that of an attack upon a prison: the storming of the Bastille in July 1789 that is taken as the beginning of the French Revolution. This was partly an achievement of later propaganda by the revolutionaries - the prison, far from being the vast, institutional embodiment of despotism, in fact contained a mere seven petty criminals. The sans-culottes also marched on Versailles, the real seat of power, yet it is the symbol of the Bastille that is remembered. </p> <p>In revolutions of the modern era, parliament buildings and TV stations have been the preferred targets; for successful revolutions, in this age of mass media, are also public performances. In Yugoslavia last year, Belgrade's parliament building served as a spectacular stage set for popular insurrection. The Berlin Wall was the perfect symbolic location for German celebrations after the downfall of the DDR. And it is largely thanks to a film-maker, Sergei Eisenstein, that the storming of the Winter Palace in St Petersburg - with the masses trampling the thick carpets of the tsar - became as central to the notion of the Russian Revolution as the storming of the Bastille to the French. </p> <p> Revolutions turn to the very centres of power; riots usually target symbols of power. Before the 18th century, rioters, especially those hungry or impoverished, often chose as the focus of their hatred the tollgates on England's roads. These could be easily and satisfyingly thrown down, and economic oppression symbolically thrown off. In the 18th century, the new turnpikes, which financed Britain's new roads, were a frequent provocation to provincial riots. In the mass destruction of turnpikes in West Yorkshire in 1753, at least 10 protesters were killed by the local militia. </p> <p>It is worth noting at this point that the breaking of windows in the City - a tactic associated with the recent May Day protests - is not a new idea. During the Wilkite riots of 1768, every window and lamp of the City's Mansion House, symbol of its financial and political power, was smashed, and the Gordon rioters attacked the Bank of England. Yet these protesters, led by Lord George Gordon, president of the \"Protestant Association\", were entirely and furiously conservative. </p> <p>Indeed, anti-authoritarianism has not always been progressive in nature. Patriotic, reactionary rioters, demonstrating in Birmingham in 1791 against those radicals who sympathised with the French Revolution, destroyed the laboratory and library of the intellectual Joseph Priestley. </p> <p>One of the principal causes of riots throughout British history has been xenophobia. From the anti-Jewish riots that accompanied the coronation of Richard the Lionheart in 1189, when the homes of London Jews were looted and burned, to the wrecking of German bakers' shops in the East End in 1914, popular rage has often turned against the property of foreigners and outsiders. In 1736, thousands of London weavers, fearful of being displaced by Irish workers, destroyed Irish pubs and dwellings in Shoreditch and Spitalfields; and in the late 1860s, mobs roused to anti-Catholic fervour burnt to the ground houses in the Irish enclaves of several Lancashire towns. </p> <p>Sometimes an entire profession has attracted the ire of the mob. During the peasants' revolt, rioters vented their fury on the Temple in London, the hive of lawyers, who were hated as the agents of manorial lords, helping them control and bind their serfs. The Kentish men sacked the lawyers' inns and dwellings: an approving eyewitness recorded, \"It was marvellous to see how even the most aged and infirm of them scrambled off, with the agility of rats or evil spirits.\" Shakespeare was perhaps reflecting this historical reality in Henry VI part II when he had Dick the Butcher, right-hand man of the rebel Jack Cade, cry, \"The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.\" </p> <p>Fear of the mob was keenly felt in Shakespeare's England. Dearth was a constant threat, food shortages were frequent and the populace was readily thought of as what one of his contemporaries called \"the Beast with many Heads\". The opening scene of Coriolanus, where the patrician, Menenius, confronts a rabble of \"poor citizens\" demanding bread and threatening violence, dramatises those fears. He tells them: \"You may as well/Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them against the Roman state, whose course will on/The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs/Of more strong link asunder than can ever/Appear in your impediment.\" </p> <p>The word \"mob\" was first used in 1688, the year of the Glorious Revolution, at a time of great political upheaval, and it was to become a key word in the 18th century. Writers such as Addison and Swift complained about the inelegance of the term (short for \"mobile vulgus\", the excitable crowd), but it stood for a vulgar, sometimes irrepressible reality. Henry Fielding sardonically called the London mob - rather than the press - the \"fourth estate\". </p> <p>The age of Enlightenment saw its share of rioting and in the late 18th century, with the birth of the confident, organised and educated urban mob, riots began to show signs of the sophistication that they have today. In the 1760s and 1770s, protesters took to the streets in support of John Wilkes. Wilkes, who himself coined the dismissive term \"mobocracy\" to describe the revolutionary government of France, was dubbed in the press the first \"mobocratical\" politician. He campaigned for wider parliamentary representation and the \"liberty\" of bourgeois Englishmen, including the freedom of the press. Every move in his campaign was accompanied by displays of support on the London streets, bouts of window-smashing in the City, and by indiscriminate attacks on the houses of wealthy Londoners - some of whom were supporters of Wilkes. </p> <p>The most destructive riots of the early 19th century added another word to the English language. The Luddite disturbances in the north and the midlands, later fictionalised in Charlotte Bront\u00eb's novel Shirley, occurred between 1811 and 1816, when rioters broke into mills and workshops to destroy the new machinery that threatened their jobs and rates of pay. In some cases, factories containing machines such as the new steam loom were destroyed. Yet as with today's prospective rioters, the Luddites' power was exerted as much through rumour as through action. Employers were warned of possible attack, often in letters signed with \"Ned Ludd's compliments\". </p> <p>Rioting became more difficult for agitators with the founding of the Metropolitan police in 1830, and then the establishment of police forces nationwide in 1856. Nonetheless the Victorian age saw a rash of election riots (sparked by the mismatch of new democratic hopes and an old, corrupt reality), and a number of notable urban riots, especially from the 1860s to the 1880s. As well as the Pall Mall riots there was, in 1866, the breaking-down of the railings surrounding Hyde Park by a huge crowd demonstrating for political reform (inspiring Matthew Arnold to write Culture and Anarchy). There were also the \"Murphy riots\" of 1867, named after the touring speaker William Murphy, a Protestant zealot who roused his audiences to anti-Catholic fury. On one occasion, a mob pulled the roof off Birmingham Town Hall because Murphy had been refused permission to hold a meeting there, and Catholic churches were attacked after his meetings on several occasions. </p> <p>It was the Victorian mob that first adopted the practice of turning the forces sent to prevent or control a riot into a target. In the \"Bloody Sunday\" riots of 1887, in the streets around Trafalgar Square, the police became the focus of the rioters' wrath. The demonstration against unemployment became the kind of running battle with the police with which we are now entirely familiar. </p> <p>The fear of rioting stoked in the press over the last few weeks also follows traditional patterns. Often, for instance, a kind of mythology attaches to the supposed leaders of riots. Readers of London's Evening Standard were shown grainy photos (from CCTV cameras) of the supposed organisers of last year's riots, when the Cenotaph in Whitehall and Winston Churchill's statue outside the Houses of Parliament were daubed with graffiti decrying capitalism. These \"24 missing anarchists\" have evaded all public appeals and police raids; they are the dark spirits presumed to be plotting mayhem for this May Day. </p> <p> In the past, fear and mystery (or, presumably, for protesters, excitement and a passing sense of power) generated strange names and wild reputations for those who \"captained\" dangerous disturbances. Among many others, there was Captain Pouch, who was proclaimed leader of the Midland food riots of 1607; Anderson of the Fens, reputed organiser of anti-enclosure riots in 17th-century Cambridgeshire; Tom the Barber, who led anti-Irish riots in London in the 1730s; and, most famously, Ned Ludd, mythical commander of protesting machine breakers. </p> <p>In this, as in so much else, the elusive architects of modern May Day anarchy are part of a long lineage. And though they might wish to distance themselves from the reactionary xenophobes who led many of Britain's popular insurrections, the expressed targets of next week's planned disturbances - American multinational businesses - are curiously reminiscent of the \"wealthy foreign merchants\" who received the unwelcome attentions of the medieval mob on \"Evil May Day\" 500 years ago.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As May Day approaches, warnings have grown louder about impending riots in the capital. Where will they be? Two years ago it was the City, last year Westminster and Whitehall. This year the rumours - fuelled by internet announcements by would-be protesters - point to that canyon of Mammon, Oxford Street. \"Mayhem\" (the favoured word in the popular press), it seems, is to be the order of the day. Stores are said to be hiring extra security staff; litter bins will be removed so that they cannot serve as missiles. Particular outlets that have been singled out for attention are Starbucks, Gap and, predictably, McDonald's. The idea of agitators giving prior notice of their intended targets might seem odd, but Britain has a long tradition of riots and, down the centuries, mobs have often made their intended targets clear in advance. Protesters have realised that the anticipation of a riot can be as disruptive as any actual assault on property, and riots are more often remembered for their targets than for their causes. While the May Day protests are a relatively new phenomenon, they share many of the historical protocols of the British riot. The disturbances in Elizabethan and Jacobean England, for example, especially those directed against the enclosure of common land, frequently took place on traditional holidays. The rioters would throw down the fences erected to deny access to land on which they had once been allowed to graze their animals, demonstrate their contempt for the landowner (occasionally by surrounding his house or burning him in effigy) - and then would dutifully return to work the next day. Holidays were used for the brief expression of a long-nursed discontent. Nearly 500 years ago, on May 1 1517, riots were directed against the property of affluent foreign merchants and craftsmen plying their trades in London. These became known as the \"Evil May Day\" riots. The idea of targeting buildings that stand for conspicuous consumption, too, is an old one. The peasants' revolt of 1381 saw ferocious disturbances in London, and what was called \"luxury\" was one of its targets. Various palaces and grand houses were attacked; Lambeth Palace, the home of the Archbishop of Canterbury, was sacked - not because he was head of the church, but because it was his seat of opulence. At the height of the riot, the Savoy Palace, the most magnificent private mansion in England, was systematically demolished. The Savoy was the huge riverside home of John of Gaunt, Richard II's uncle and the nation's power broker. Standing on what is now the Strand, it was famous for its owner's magnificent collection of furniture, tapestries, jewels and ornaments. The rioters, who blamed John of Gaunt for the introduction of the poll tax that had detonated the revolt, destroyed everything. What could not be smashed or burned was thrown into the river. Jewellery was pulverised with hammers, and it was said that one rioter found by his fellows to have kept a silver goblet for himself was killed for doing so. Looting, however, has rarely been controlled so strictly by protesters. Before the 19th century, food riots, usually set off by price rises, often led to the looting of warehouses, and occasionally even of ships carrying food for export. Those who wished to mock the political radicals behind the so-called Pall Mall riots of 1886, which arose from a socialist demonstration against government policies, were quick to publicise the rioters' thefts from St James's vintners.

But Nasa spokesman Rob Navias said that no decision had yet been made. `We're still in negotiations with the Russians,' he said. Yesterday 61-year-old Mr Tito accused America of erecting political obstacles to the pioneering journey that he paid \u00a314m to make. Mr Tito said that his preparations had been arduous but that he felt fully fit. `The training was most difficult. It was made more difficult by political problems,'' he said. Referring to US objections to his week in space, Mr Tito added: `I have the support of the Russian people and the Kazakh people and we came through. The politics is over and I think now the flight is ahead of us.'' Russian officials met last night to consider whether or not to delay the launch by at least a day.",

Witness our most treasured spouses: Penelope at her loom, waiting two decades for Odysseus to return home from work, or Queen Victoria mourning her husband for half a century.

Husbands now help their pregnant wives with \"breathing techniques\" and \"carry their infants in frontal pouches\". That these examples of revolutionary fervour seem so pitiful is less a sign of Yalom's analytical weakness than a reflection of how much more of a bargain marriage is for men than it is for women. </p> <p> A History of the Wife is not a penetrative analysis of the peculiar state into which women have been given, bartered, bought and sold for the last two millennia, but a survey of the roles and expectations of wifehood from biblical and classical times to contemporary America. It is a gentle sociological consideration, nurtured by the vagaries of women's studies and frequently brought into focus by sharp sets of statistics. </p> <p>The book has two objects: first, to show how the expectations that women \"rebel\" against today - \"the wife as a man's chattel, as his dependent, as his means for acquiring legal offspring, as the caretaker of his children, as his cook and housekeeper\" - are ancient obligations against which rebellion is nothing new. Unbeknown to her husband, the medieval mystic Margery Kempe wore a hair shirt in bed as penance for sexual intercourse. While documenting the history of resistance to marital duty, Yalom argues that marriage in the west has changed dramatically: it used to be a religious duty and is now a secular choice. She illustrates this with a brisk journey, full of wonderful quotations, through medieval Europe, Reformation Germany, the French and American revolutions and the English and American Victorian age, before reaching the wives of the 20th century. </p> <p>Today, Yalom regrets, \"young people engage in sex with several partners and then 'fall in love' with one of them\". Although she acknowledges that the place of romantic love in the story of marriage has a history, emerging alongside the romantic novel at the end of the 18th century, Yalom does not regard its construction as in any way ideological. </p> <p>Thus she accepts that \"love\" is the strongest basis on which to ground a marriage, and is astounded by those cultures that think otherwise. \"Both for traditional Indian families and for classical Romans, it was normal for love to come after marriage.

Just look around you. While this is the kind of accusation that goes down well until it dawns on you that it applies to you too, the point is that no one is free from folly; the trick is to be aware of the fact. Let us consider the most pompous and self-important ass in the public sphere at the moment. For no reason in particular that I can think of, Lord Irvine of Lairg springs to mind. He it was, you will recall, who compared himself to Cardinal Wolsey. Would he have done so, one wonders, if he had recalled that Wolsey was for years the exasperated butt of Henry VIII's irrepressible and in some ways archetypal jester, Will Somers? Or that John Skelton, whose learning, buffoonery and general lack of respect for established orders brought him into the realm of court jesting, also couldn't resist having a go at him? </p> <p>Wolsey, apparently, had a jester, yet history forgets his jests; the king's jester will trump your own. And he will almost always trump the king. If Beatrice K Otto's summary of thousands of years of wizz-taking at despots' expense is to be trusted, then the number of monarchs who have wearied of their fools and executed them is strikingly low. Something of a Sinophile, she has at her disposal a wealth of information about the antics of Chinese jesters, whose techniques and ends bespeak an unrivalled cultural continuum of satire at the courts' expense. She translates their names, too, so instead of the monikers Zhou Za and You Zhan we have the striking Going Round in Circles and Twisty Pole. Their jokes do not survive the passage of miles and centuries intact, but their attitudes - skirting dangerously the limits of an emperor's tolerance - are recognisably admirable today, although many of Otto's chosen anecdotes from Chinese annals end with the otherwise bloodthirsty dictator being temporarily mollified or swayed by the wit of a clown, as if that makes things all right. There is obviously a bigger picture here, though one concedes that to illuminate it would exceed Otto's brief. </p> <p>Sometimes one wonders not so much at her equanimity in the face of outrageous despotism as at the impression she gives of being entirely wrapped in her subject: speculating, for example, how a jester at modern arms-limitation talks would speed up the proceedings immensely, had either side the wit to hire one. Or this: \"Court jesters are very much alive and kicking in the collective memory of most places that fostered them, with the exception of China, although it is hard to find reasons for this oriental amnesia.\" Let me speculate: it may have something to do with living under a brutal and inordinately repressive dictatorial machine with a strong inclination to stifle even the idea of dissent. (In the meantime, the Chinese novelist Wang Shuo seems to be making a decent fist of reviving the satiric pulse of his nation.) </p> <p>Less worrying but more mystifying is the way she takes at face value the notion that \"[Sir Jimmy] Savile . . . plays the part of the court jester to the establishment with consummate skill, is a regular visitor to Kensington and Buckingham palaces, as well as the prime minister's country residence at Chequers. As the unofficial clown he articulates opinions which courtiers can only think.\" That this comes from a 1990 article by Andrew Morton in the Sunday Times, with the headline \"The Royal Marriage: Happy Ever After?\" shows us, if not Otto, what we can make of it. It also at least demonstrates that Otto has the integrity and good manners to cite her sources punctiliously. </p> <p>It is probably unimportant whether she has chosen not to theorise about jesting or is incapable of doing so. It certainly bespeaks a lack of side: she is more interested in displaying her astonishingly eclectic source material than in gathering it together under some spurious umbrella. This is a book that gets you asking the right kinds of questions rather than supplying you with the answers. You may well wonder, after reading it, why the western mania for court jesters and fools died down suddenly in 17th-century Europe. Otto does, at least, supply one convincing contemporary theory for their disappearance, from Thomas Shadwell in 1679, which would appear to hold true to this day: \"because nowadays [great men] are their own fools, and so save Charges\".</p>",

You may well wonder, after reading it, why the western mania for court jesters and fools died down suddenly in 17th-century Europe. Otto does, at least, supply one convincing contemporary theory for their disappearance, from Thomas Shadwell in 1679, which would appear to hold true to this day: \"because nowadays [great men] are their own fools, and so save Charges\".",

      "body": "<p>With the prospect of much of the country's open spaces remaining off limits until well into the summer, frustrated walkers are now looking longingly across to foot-and-mouth-free Europe. Here are five top walking destinations that can be easily reached for a four-day weekend break. </p> <p><strong> Northern France</strong><br> </p> <p> The walking is easy through the open, rolling countryside and farmland around the north French coast. Walking specialist Inntravel's \"A Stroll to Market\" is a three-day, 17-mile ramble along country footpaths and tracks. All walkers are given detailed maps together with background notes to the area. Picnic lunches are also provided, so a small daysack is a good idea and, to make it even easier, your luggage is ferried ahead to your evening's destination. </p> <p>On the first day, you walk seven miles, starting from the village of Inxent, through quiet valleys before finishing at a farmhouse hotel. The next day, the 10-mile ramble winds through more Picardy hamlets before finishing in the market town of Montreuil. Finally, a taxi takes you back to pick up your car at the starting point of Inxent.</p> <p><strong> Best time to go:</strong> Right now, as spring has arrived and the hedgerows and woodlands are bursting into life.</p> <p><strong> Price: </strong> Between \u00a3215 and \u00a3224, depending upon departure. Includes three nights' half-board, two picnic lunches, two luggage transfers and return ferry from Dover to Calais.</p> <p><strong> Contact:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.inntravel.co.uk\">Inntravel</a>, tel: 01653 629010.</p> <p><strong> Bavarian/ Austrian Alps</strong><br> </p> <p> The introduction of Ryanair's Stansted-Salzburg service has brought some of Europe's most dramatic scenery within the long-weekend walker's sights - and pocket. </p> <p>Endless walking opportunities of every grade can be found within half-an-hour's drive of Salzburg. One of the highlights is a three-day hike through the Berchtesgaden National Park in neighbouring Germany. The 25-mile walk from K\u00f6nigsee to Wimbachtal, which straddles the German-Austrian border, offers scenery of towering mountains and crystal-clear lakes. The trail also involves staying in what the locals refer to as huts, but which are cosy guest houses set deep within the mountains. </p> <p>It contains some long, steep climbs, so you do need to be in good shape. </p> <p> <strong> Best time to go:</strong> Currently good, easy walking is possible in the valley bottoms and in the Salzkammergut, Austria's own Lake District. By early June, when most of the snow has melted, walkers can head up to the high mountain tracks. </p> <p> <strong> Further information:</strong> A detailed guide to the K\u00f6nigsee walk is contained within the <a href=\"http://www.cicerone.co.uk\">Cicerone Guide to Walking in the Bavarian Alps</a>, though you will need a map as well. Cicerone also publishes a guide to walking in the Salzkammergut. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation:</strong> If you want to do the K\u00f6nigsee walk, you should check the availability of the huts before you leave the UK (numbers are listed in the guide). One night costs around \u00a37 with evening dinner around \u00a35. For information regarding staying in either Salzburg or Berchtesgaden, which is just 12 miles away and close to the trail head, contact the <a href=\"http://www.germany-tourism.de\">German Tourist Board</a> (tel: 0900 1600100) or the <a href=\"http://www.austria-tourism.at\">Austrian Tourist Board</a> (tel: 020-7629 0461).</p> <p><strong> Getting there:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com\">Ryanair</a> (0541 569569) flies from Stansted to Salzburg twice a day from \u00a3103 including taxes. </p> <p><strong> Alpes Maritimes</strong><br> </p> <p> At the heart of the Alpes Maritimes in south-eastern France lies the Mercantour National Park with its dramatic peaks, alpine meadows and extensive trails, which are relatively deserted compared with those in the more famous Alps to the north. </p> <p>And while these tracks can challenge the most experienced walker, a network of trails linking the medieval Perched Villages that cling to the wild hillsides around the southern approaches to the park offer gentler gradients. These paths take walkers through olive groves and forests of chestnut and pine. </p> <p>Breil sur Roya is typical of the Perched Villages and is a good base for exploring the area as a number of long-distance trails pass through it. </p> <p>A great way to do sections of these trails is to take the train which passes through Breil higher up the valley and walk back down sections no longer than 10 miles in any one go. </p> <p> <strong> Best time to go:</strong> Spring. </p> <p> <strong> Further information:</strong> A walking guide to the Perched Villages is available in English from the regional tourist office in France (tel: 00 33 4 93 04 92 05). <a href=\"http://www.sunflowerbooks.co.uk\">Sunflower Books</a> publishes detailed walks in the region in its South of France guidebook, and the Lonely Planet guide to walking in France contains details of routes in the Mercantour National Park.

For the long-weekend walker, the Pyrenees are an option by virtue of the Ryanair service to Biarritz. If you don't want to drive once you arrive, you can base yourself in the seaside resort of St Jean de Luz, just down the road from the airport, or in one of the many medieval villages nestling in the foothills, such as Ainhoa, which is 12 miles from the airport. From both, it's possible to walk small sections of one of the many long-distance trails that traverse the entire Pyrennean chain; in Ainhoa, for example, the trails pass right through the village. </p> <p>However, if you don't mind driving from Biarritz, a two-hour journey takes you to Bedous to the south-east. This small town is a perfect base for exploring some of the most dramatic parts of the Pyrenees. For example, the tough 14-mile hike up to the Pic de Labigouer is a classic ridge walk that takes you high into the heart of the Pyrenees with stunning views down the valley and across into Spain. </p> <p> <strong> Best time to go:</strong> The lower foothills are an ideal option now, the higher ridges being snow-free by late May. </p> <p> <strong> Further information:</strong> A detailed description of the walk up to the Pic de Labigouer is contained in the Lonely Planet guide to Walking in France. <a href=\"http://www.sunflowerbooks.co.uk\">Sunflower Books</a> also publish details of easy walks in the western Pyrenees. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation:</strong> St Jean de Luz has a variety of accommodation; visit <a href=\"http://www.123voyage.com\">www.123voyage.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.tourisme.fr\">www.tourisme.fr</a> for details. In Ainhoa, the 400-year-old Hotel Oppoca (tel: 00 33 5 59 29 90 72) has rooms from \u00a325 to \u00a332pp per night. In Bedous, Le Mandragot (tel: 00 33 5 59 34 59 33) has basic rooms for \u00a35 a night. Plus staying in one of the many Pyrennean mountain refuges is also a cheap option; for details, contact the local tourist office on 00 33 5 59 34 71 48. For other accommodation, contact the French Tourist Office in London (0906 824 4123). </p> <p> <strong> Getting there:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com\">Ryanair</a> flies to Biarritz from Stansted from \u00a3130 including taxes.</p> <p><strong> Norway</strong><br> </p> <p> Quite why Norway has failed to register on the average walker's radar is one of life's great outdoor mysteries. After all, it has breathtaking fjords, endless mountains and wilderness together with a terrific network of walking huts. </p> <p>For the weekend walker, the best way to tackle Norway is to aim for Bergen as there are outstanding hikes from within the city itself and the spectacular fjords are just a short distance away. </p> <p>Take the funicular railway from virtually the middle of town up the 1,000ft Mount Floyen and walk on the well-marked trails through the woods before heading back down with views overlooking the city and sea. </p> <p>Another option is to take the train for a stunning two-hour journey through the mountains to Myrdral. From here, walk down an old railway line for about 12 miles to Flam at the head of a fjord. The walk should take about five hours and being flat or downhill it's easy going and the views are terrific. </p> <p>From Flam, you can either return by rail to Bergen or you can take a boat trip on the fjord to Gudvangen from where you get the bus to Voss and then the train to Bergen. This trip makes for a long day but is a great introduction to the fjord region. </p> <p>Those looking for more challenging trails should head for Voss, a good base to explore the mountains and fjords north of Bergen. Walks can be strung together using the reliable local public transport links. </p> <p> <strong> Best time to go:</strong> From late May onwards, most of the trails will be accessible and strewn with flowers, plus it will be light late into the evening. </p> <p> <strong> Information:</strong> DNT is Norway's walking association and the DNT office in Bergen (tel: 00 47 55 32 22 30) will give details of the walks described above and background to walking in the region. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation:</strong> The Rica Travel Hotel in Bergen (tel: 00 47 55 31 54 00) has weekend offers on double rooms from \u00a332. For budget trav ellers, the YMCA Family and Youth Hostel (tel: 00 47 55 60 60 50) offers clean and basic rooms for \u00a310 a night, breakfast included. In Voss, the Norlandia Jarl Hotel (tel: 00 47 56 51 19 33) has double rooms from \u00a338.

The first time I came here was from the Spanish side, and the road signs were in Spanish plus another language I couldn't decipher. Across the French border the signs were in French plus the same impenetrable hieroglyphs. Basque is a unique collection of x's, double z's, tt's and rr's. Meet Monsieur Acoztarra, see rue Etcheverri garay, eat ttoro (fish soup), drink Izzarra. Related to Hungarian and Japanese, apparently. I quite believe it. </p> <p>Once pirates, then whalers and now France's main tuna fishermen, the locals have always been tough and independent. Yet fine style and high culture have equally been a part of the history. The harbour is a postcard scene of half-timbered houses painted bright red and white, and the galleried church of St Jean-Baptiste is a bijou showpiece of gilt, statuary and stained glass. It was built in the 1400s and made famous when Louis XIV, the Sun King came here to marry Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Spain in 1660. </p> <p>The air appears always to be filled with music: youngsters strum guitars in the street; there are open-air folk concerts; and the church and several halls have orchestras and choirs. Maurice Ravel was born here and professors give master classes to students of his piano music. </p> <p>You'll also hear the sharp crack of the pelota ball carrying through the narrow streets. Some schools, and even pubs, have indoor and outdoor courts, where young men whack a hard-ball with wooden rackets against a wall in a style similar to squash. The fast version, cesta punta , is the traditional Basque game which attracts crowds and teams from all over the region. It is played with long wicker gloves which propel the ball like a missile. For those who like to hit a stationary ball, there is a picturesque golf course at the Club de la Nivelle, which runs through the hills alongside the river. </p> <p>The curved bay is protected by a boom and nothing is allowed inside it except swimmers, so the water skiers and jet skiers and power boaters have to go out with the tuna boats. </p> <p>In between sport and culture comes \"thalassotherapie\" - saltwater treatments - and many come here for a course which can last anything between one day and one week. The Hotel H\u00e9lianthal offers programmes of swimming, sauna, water aerobics, massage, and every kind of therapy in an attempt to straighten out mind and body. </p> <p>At the end of the day, the bars in Place Louis XIV serve drinks to the sound of music from the bandstand, before everyone moves on to the restaurants of the port, Boulevard Thiers or Rue de la Republique. Being the south-west, duck appears on most menus, but the specialities are Atlantic fish, tuna, sardine and shellfish. Rioja is served as the local wine. </p> <p>The best of all I leave till last: ttoro, which epitomises all the traditions of the region - the seafaring, the culture, the art ofgood living. Fish soup is on every menu and eaten in every home; there's even a f te dedicated to it at the end of September - the F te du Ttoro. After service in the church of St Jean Baptiste, the square is taken over by a couple of dozen cooks who set up their charcoal grills and cook their fish, vegetables, herbs and spices in pans swimming in butter and garlic. The aromas fill the air as the soups are left to simmer in vats for much of the afternoon. </p> <p>Meantime, the town band leads a fancy dress parade of grotesque creatures through the streets before the panel of judges convene to taste the soup of each competitor. All the soup is then carried round to the town's restaurants and the day ends at midnight with a confetti fight in the crowded streets. </p> <p>The f\u00eate marks the end of the holiday season, although more and more hotels and restaurants remain open all year for those in search of peace, bracing air and a bit of winter sunshine. </p> <p> <strong> What to see</strong> </p> <p> The church of St Jean Baptiste in Rue Gambetta is a wonder. Built in the 1400s like a small cathedral, the gleaming gilt altar and stained glass are must-sees. </p> <p> Le Fronton Municipal, in Route de Bayonne, is the open air-stadium where cesta punta is played between teams from all over the Basque region. </p> <p> Le Maison Louis XIV, just off Place Louis XIV, is a 17th-century house that's open to the public, showing the original bedrooms, kitchen, dining room and crockery. </p> <p> The port has fish auctions. </p> <p> <strong> Things to do</strong> </p> <p> The beach is clean and safe enough for children to swim. Also sailing, windsurfing, water skiing and diving. There's tennis and squash (tel: 00 33 559 47 18 99), two golf clubs (Chantais 26 14 22; Nivelle 47 18 59); and sea and river fishing. </p> <p> For shopping, there's Rue Gambetta, which has delicatessens, boutiques, beauticians and bookshops. Rue Victor Hugo is a \"real\" street with butchers and bakers, fishmongers and haberdashers and a covered market. And there's a casino (00 33 559 26 09 09). </p> <p> <strong> Where to eat</strong> </p> <p>The town has literally hundreds of places to eat, the greatest concentration being in Place Louis XIV and rue de la Republique, which has restaurants running the length of both sides of the street. Because of the intense competition, prices tend to be similar - main courses \u00a36-\u00a312, menus \u00a38-\u00a318, house wines \u00a35-\u00a310. </p> <p>Restaurant Ongui Ethorri, 15 rue de la Republique, (00 33 559 26 85 07) specialises in fruits de mer and paella. </p> <p>Taverne Basque, 5 rue de la Republique (00 33 559 26 01 26), has a pubby appearance and pubby food. </p> <p> Kayola, rue de la Republique (00 33 559 51 01 12), has an unusual Basque-cum-mod-art ambience and a big \u00e0 la carte menu of fish and meats. </p> <p>Gillerie du Port - in the open area by the port where a number of restaurants have wide terraces overlooking the harbour - serves almost exclusively sardines and tuna and is usually packed out. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay</strong> </p> <p> At the low-cost end, there are no fewer than eight camping sites in the vicinity plus a host of B&amp;Bs. </p> <p> The two-star Hotel Bolivar at 18 Rue Sopite (00 33 559 26 02 00) is two streets back from the beach and has 17 rooms ranging from wash basin and no WC to en-suite. Price \u00a323-\u00a333 per room per night. </p> <p> Hotel Prado, Place Maurice Ravel (00 33 559 57 03 71) is on the front (its caf\u00e9 is on the prom) and has 38 rooms, similar to Bolivar, ranging from \u00a330-\u00a345 per room. </p> <p> Hotel Madison, 25 Boulevard Thiers (00 33 559 26 35 02) is three-star, five minutes' walk from the shore and has 25 rooms and a sauna. \u00a328-\u00a352 per room. </p> <p> H\u00e9lianthal, Place Maurice Ravel. Higher class modern hotel with 100 bedrooms with all facilities, two minutes from the town centre and the beach. It has a thalassotherapie area with pools, Jacuzzi, sauna, steam and and treatments for which you have to pay extra. Prices for a basic room from \u00a393-\u00a3119. </p> <p> Parc Victoria, 5 rue C\u00e9p\u00e9 (00 33 559 26 78 78), is further away from the beach and town centre and has only 17 rooms, but they are luxurious and feature lots of services, a swimming pool, beautiful garden and good food. </p> <p> <strong> Around and about</strong> </p> <p>Spain is six miles to the south, Biarritz nine miles to the north and within a radius of 100 miles are Bordeaux and Lourdes in France, Pamplona and San Sebastian in Spain. </p> <p> <strong> Further information</strong> </p> <p> The Office de Tourisme, Place du Marechal Foch, tel: 00 33 559 26 03 16. </p> <p> <strong> Way to go</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.raileurope.co.uk\">Rail Europe</a> (08705 848848) includes Eurostar to Lille and then TGV, from \u00a3109 return. <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com\">Ryanair</a> (0541 569569) return from Stansted to Biarritz from \u00a399.10 week days.

      "bodyText": "I'll be in trouble for writing this because those who love St Jean de Luz don't want anyone else to know about it. It has no high-rise hotels and it's off the package-holiday track, so people have to discover it for themselves. It is a homely place, small enough for the town's \"character\", with his umbrella and ankle-length tweed coat in mid-summer, to be given a patisserie or a slice of Bayonne ham by the shopkeepers as he passes by. But it is big enough to offer visitors (not tourists) dozens of small hotels and scores of restaurants as well as a clean, safe beach.

Americans have the right to know how the government is spending at least two billion dollars over the next two years to 'fight the drugs (not, openly, to protect the oil). So the Colombian journalists duty is, among many aspects in the armed conflict, reporting the behavior of oil corporations and foreign military help to the dirtiest Army in the continent.

Now it seemed they were threatening to make Oldham, this once-proud Lancashire mill town, into a foreign land for the white families.</p> <p>The attack took place on Saturday, three days after Asian teenagers had told a radio reporter that no-go zones had been created for whites, and it crystallised all the fears that report invoked.</p> <p>But the attack was not such a simple story. After the assault Mr Chamberlain was interviewed briefly by police officers and he told them he had been confronted by an Asian in his late teens, who demanded to know his address. The pensioner refused and was shoved.</p> <p>In a carefully-worded press statement, police said they had not established whether his injuries were the result of him falling or being struck. It was thought two other Asian youths were present. Mr Chamberlain's wallet was not taken but his metal coffee flask was missing, possibly stolen. Police said the attack was being treated as racially motivated.</p> <p>The headline on the front page of Monday's Manchester Evening News read Get Out Of Our Area, beside a picture of the battered grandfather. Those words were given to the paper by a senior detective, and though Mr Chamberlain did not say this in his initial statement, a force spokesman confirmed that police believe this was said to him.</p> <p>Members of the local Asian communities were both horrified and baffled by the attack. It did not fit the profile of violence, in which the victims have largely been young males, both white and Asian.</p> <p>Mr Chamberlain was attacked on an access road through an industrial estate towards the mainly white part of town where he lived. It was a no-mans' land unclaimed by any of the area's teenage gangs and therefore the words 'get out of our area' made little sense.</p> <p>Then on Thursday night, Mr Chamberlain's son Steven denied there had been a racial motive. He told ITN's Tonight with Trevor McDonald: \"It was a violent assault on an elderly man. As a family we don't think it was a race issue at all - it's an assault.\" The family are concerned that Mr Chamberlain may be a target when he returns home from hospital where he has had an operation on his fractured cheekbone. This fear may have governed what they told Tonight.</p> <p>It may also be that they were seeking to pour some oil on troubled waters. It is certainly needed; the BNP's leader Nick Griffin is standing here at the general election, while the National Front is seeking to exploit tensions by applying for permission to march next Saturday. The police have applied for Home Office permission to ban the march.</p> <p>Police, some of whom remain convinced Mr Chamberlain would not have been attacked were he an Asian grandfather, are continuing to treat this as a racist attack. Detectives stress that it is a very small number of Asian youths who are causing trouble; as few as 10 may have perpetrated up to 80 attacks.</p> <p>Ordinary people say the reporting of the last 10 days has misrepresented their town. The reality, they say, is that Oldham is not a powder-keg. It is not, though a tiny handful of yobs might want it to be, a racial battleground.</p> <p>\"I live right in the middle of the problem,' said Rukhsana Sarwar, 17, a student at Oldham sixth-form college.'But the way the media has presented it has increased tension because they have made out that it is mainly Asian attacks on white people. They have angered the Asian community, stirred up racial trou ble and made it even worse.\"</p> <p>Rukhsana, who is going to Oxford to read law in the autumn, spoke of attacks on both Asians and whites. \"Asian people do not trust the police as much and don't report these incidents. But it's not just about race. It's about violence.''</p> <p>Catherine Creamer, another 17-year-old A level student, said the reporting may have increased tensions but those tensions had been present for a long time.\"Perhaps the issues needed to be brought to crisis point before they can be solved,\" she suggested. \"But our lives are not built on racial tensions. This does not reflect the Oldham I know.\"</p> <p>What is happening here is based on ignorance in the literal sense of a lack of knowledge. Of Oldham's current population of 219,000, around 24,600 are Asian: 14,000 Pakistani, 9,000 Bangladeshi, and 1,600 Indians. But it is largely split between white, Pakistani and Bangladeshi areas. Primary schools are mostly dominated by one of these communities, so often the first time young people of different races mix is at secondary school.</p> <p>The divides are historic. Oldham's Asian population came here in the post-war decades to work the unpopular night shift in the cotton mills. They were skilled workers, recruited from textile factories in the Sylhet area of Bangladesh, parts of Pakistan, and Gujarat in India. They settled in the cheapest parts of town, near people who spoke the same language.</p> <p>When the cotton business began to suffer, the Asian night-workers were first to go. With no language or social skills because they had worked at nights, times were extremely hard in the tough economic climate of the late 1970s. White families were going through hard times too, and then as now the National Front swaggered through the town blaming these hardships on the immigrants.</p> <p>A generation grew up watching their cowed parents being subjected to abuse. This history sometimes becomes an excuse for present-day attacks on whites, but is only one ingredient in the mix. Some of it is more about puberty than racism; teenage males staking out their turfs and picking on boys of a different colour in dim-witted acts of bravado. There is also a criminal element. Drug dealers sometimes employ teenagers as look-outs, briefed to scare off anyone who looks like a stranger.</p> <p>The whole of this is overlaid by a cultural divide which can lead to trivial run-ins escalating out of control. Dogs are a good example of this. Fido is an Englishman's best friend, but many people from the subcontinent regard them as dirty and dangerous animals. While the Guardian's reporters were in Oldham they were given two separate accounts of arguments that started over dogs running off their leads and ended with blood-curdling threats.</p> <p>Some white people, particularly young men, hold genuine fears about walking through Asian areas on their own. Asians feel the same about walking through some predominantly white areas. But there is no evidence that any part of Oldham is truly a no-go zone.</p> <p>Tariq Rafique, chair of the Pakistani Youth Association, is frustrated that all Asians have been branded racist since the attack on Walter Chamberlain. \"It's just two or three mindless idiots who have targeted this poor pensioner. They are cowards. The community needs to flush these people out. But it's just a handful of kids who are doing more harm to their own community than anyone else.\"</p> <p>There has been a loss of pride among Asian elders, and a break-down of parental discipline. \"Parents used to encourage their children to do well at school so they could brag about it,\" said Mr Rafique. \"I think that's gone out of the window. With a lot of families, if their son hasn't done well, they say 'so what - so and so's son has done the same.\"</p> <p>Millions of pounds have been channelled into the deprived areas of Oldham and the results are visible in the builders busy all over the Glodwick estate, and the new Tesco and B&amp;Q on the mainly Bangladeshi Westwood estate.</p> <p>But the parts of Oldham where many Asian families live remain among the poorest places in Britain. The smaller Indian community has been assimilated more successfully, but there is high unemployment within Pakistani and Bangladeshi quarters - 16% and 25% respectively.</p> <p>There are fears among Asian leaders that some in the council believe they have had ''their turn'' and are diverting funding elsewhere. Chris Hilyer, deputy leader of the council, said there were areas of povery and deprivation across the whole borough. \"Much of the investment coming in now is quite sensibly aimed at the whole community.\" But he is able to give an impressive list of the council's achievements in Asian areas; improving housing, bringing in business, and launching initiatives to reduce crime.</p> <p>At the core of the regeneration work is improving children and teenager's educational prospects, and Oldham's sixth-form college is widely acknowledged as one of the town's biggest reasons to be cheerful.</p> <p>Nick Brown, the principal, said: \"The only way you regenerate poor communities is to have people who have knowledge, influence and power working effectively within those communities.

      "body": "<p>The race row in the Tory party threatened to run out of control yesterday when a black Tory peer, Lord Taylor of Warwick, challenged William Hague to withdraw the whip from the Bridlington MP, John Townend, after he accused ministers of wanting to turn Britons into `a mongrel race'.</p> <p>Lord Taylor, who endured racist attacks when he stood as a Conservative candidate in Cheltenham in 1992, said: `John Townend is clearly determined to continue spouting his racist rubbish. He is laying down the gauntlet to Mr Hague. The leader of the Conservative party prides himself on his judo and 14 pints a day macho image. Now is his chance to demonstrate real macho leadership by withdrawing the whip from Mr Townend and booting him out of the Conservative party.'</p> <p>Yesterday morning John Townend renewed his attack on the commission for racial equality, whose anti-racist pact he had refused to sign. Mr Hague, whose fence-mending speech in Bradford was over shadowed by Mr Townend's outburst, repudiated the remarks, but said it was too late to move against Mr Townend, even though another Tory MP, Charles Wardle who is not standing again, had the whip withdrawn earlier this month.</p> <p>`Taking the whip away from Mr Townend would just be a gesture when he's not even a candidate in the coming election. He's only got a few days left,' Mr Hague said. `I believe in substance, not gesture.'</p> <p>Lord Taylor dismissed this as a cop-out. `He has caused a great deal of offence, not only to ethnic minorities around the country, but to decent people in England of whatever colour who believe in, and live in, a multiracial, multicultural society.' Mr Townend and others who have refused to sign the CRE pact on libertarian grounds, had claimed victory in the past few days because the argument had become one of free speech rather than racism. But some Tories fear that the defence - a concern raised by some Labour members too - is being used as cover by a small racist element.</p> <p>Continuing his attack on Mr Hague, Lord Taylor said: `It might be that he is frightened of a certain rightwing element within the Tory party.' And in a scathing denunciation of Mr Hague's advisers, he said the leader was failing to send out a consistent message.</p> <p>`When people feel uncertain, they tend to shy away, and certainly the ethnic minorities feel very uncertain about what he is really saying.

      "bodyText": "The race row in the Tory party threatened to run out of control yesterday when a black Tory peer, Lord Taylor of Warwick, challenged William Hague to withdraw the whip from the Bridlington MP, John Townend, after he accused ministers of wanting to turn Britons into `a mongrel race'. Lord Taylor, who endured racist attacks when he stood as a Conservative candidate in Cheltenham in 1992, said: `John Townend is clearly determined to continue spouting his racist rubbish. He is laying down the gauntlet to Mr Hague. The leader of the Conservative party prides himself on his judo and 14 pints a day macho image. Now is his chance to demonstrate real macho leadership by withdrawing the whip from Mr Townend and booting him out of the Conservative party.' Yesterday morning John Townend renewed his attack on the commission for racial equality, whose anti-racist pact he had refused to sign. Mr Hague, whose fence-mending speech in Bradford was over shadowed by Mr Townend's outburst, repudiated the remarks, but said it was too late to move against Mr Townend, even though another Tory MP, Charles Wardle who is not standing again, had the whip withdrawn earlier this month. `Taking the whip away from Mr Townend would just be a gesture when he's not even a candidate in the coming election. He's only got a few days left,' Mr Hague said. `I believe in substance, not gesture.' Lord Taylor dismissed this as a cop-out. `He has caused a great deal of offence, not only to ethnic minorities around the country, but to decent people in England of whatever colour who believe in, and live in, a multiracial, multicultural society.' Mr Townend and others who have refused to sign the CRE pact on libertarian grounds, had claimed victory in the past few days because the argument had become one of free speech rather than racism. But some Tories fear that the defence - a concern raised by some Labour members too - is being used as cover by a small racist element. Continuing his attack on Mr Hague, Lord Taylor said: `It might be that he is frightened of a certain rightwing element within the Tory party.' And in a scathing denunciation of Mr Hague's advisers, he said the leader was failing to send out a consistent message. `When people feel uncertain, they tend to shy away, and certainly the ethnic minorities feel very uncertain about what he is really saying. If you feel that a party doesn't want you because of the colour of your skin, you're hardly likely to vote for that party,' he said. Mr Hague was barracked by protesters wearing masks of the Tory leader as he tried to raise the issues of crime, education and transport in Pudsey, near Leeds. Lord (Seb) Coe hauled three masked men away from the Tory entourage. Mr Hague's solitary purchase in the marginal constituency, a \u00a310 bunch of flowers, was greeted with a shout of: `Are those for Mr Townend?' Unruffled, he called back: `They are most definitely for my wife, Ffion.' Bill Morris, of the Transport and General Workers' Union, last night used his speech to the TUC Black Workers' Conference in Perth to raise his own concerns about race. Referring to the Hague speech, which last month triggered the race row by portraying a future where Britain was a `foreign land', Mr Morris said: `It is indeed a foreign land. A foreign land where ordinary black British families wake up almost every morning to listen on the radio to descriptions of themselves they do not recognise.' John Edmonds of the GMB union, said: `We have to have the confidence to say clearly that, although William Hague personally may not be racist, his failure to discipline members of his party shows he is prepared to see the issue of race exploited.' In further evidence of the critical role race is likely to play in the election, David Wilmot, chief constable of Greater Manchester, is seeking a Home Office prohibition order to ban a National Front march through Oldham next Saturday. Mr Wilmot said the march had been given substantial consideration but added that the order was `essential for maintaining public order and to enable positive community dialogue''.

No longer wanted at the sport's highest level, but still passion ate about racing, he switched to saloons and sports cars. It was while testing an Audi, in preparation for this year's 24-hour race at Le Mans, that he died, after his car somersaulted over a barrier on the high-speed oval section of the Lausitzring, a new circuit south of Berlin.</p> <p>His racing debut came in 1976, in a Formula Monza car built by friends. A year later, he finished third in the championship, and grad-uated to Formula Italia. In 1980, he won the European Formula Three champion- ship, with five race wins in the season.

His two grand prix victories with Tyrrell... around the Caesar's Palace car park in Las Vegas in 1982, and on the streets of downtown Detroit the following year... were the last the team ever achieved in Formula One, and, at the end of 1983 Alboreto received an offer no Italian could refuse.</p> <p>It came, he later related, as a result of an interview he had given after his win in Detroit, in which he criticised Ferrari for failing to hire an Italian driver.

      "body": "<p>How much time do you give to your garden each week (and I don't mean sitting in it, enjoying the view)? Most of us want to enjoy the outdoors, but have less and less time to do the work. We want plants that look good with the minimum of care, that cover ground quickly without cutting back on quality or quantity. We want restful, guilt-free places. Is that too much to ask for?</p> <p><strong>Work it out </strong></p> <p>To achieve this you'll need self-control, commitment, and you'll need to plan. Every plant you select should have a realistic purpose. But before you plant anything, take a long, hard look at what you've got. Check what soil type you have. Peeking at your neighbour's garden may give you some indication, but a soil-testing kit is far more reliable. What's the aspect of your garden? Split it into areas of shade and sun, and then consider how many plants you'll need to fill each area. Generally, shrubs take up a square metre, and herbaceous perennials swell into 60cm rounds. Leave space for things to grow. Cram things too tightly and you'll be constantly pruning, splitting and re-planting. Knowledge is everything in a garden. Know its limitations, and you'll easily find plants that will thrive. </p> <p><strong>Eager evergreens </strong></p> <p>No plant is perfect, but try to choose ones with the least flaws. Avoid, or get rid of, any high-maintenance plant: ones that catch diseases or need a lot of feeding. Give a wide berth to plants with messy fruits, pods or huge leaf drops. Damage limitation is the key with low-maintenance gardening. Aucuba is an obliging evergreen, and seems to grow almost anywhere. The leathery green, voluptuous A. 'Rozannie', with its light, reflecting foliage, is perfect for lifting dark patches. Other undemanding evergreen shrubs to structure your space include Mexican orange blossom (aromatic with clusters of orange-scented flowers), Photinia \u00a5 fraseri 'Red Robin' (brilliantly scarlet spring leaves), and Viburnum tinus 'Eve Price' (more compact than other varieties, with vibrantly pink flowerbuds). Yet the secret of any garden is variety through the year. For this you'll need some deciduous shrubs and herbaceous perennials. </p> <p><strong>Buoyantly deciduous </strong></p> <p>The smoke bush is the perfect undemanding deciduous shrub. Cotinus coggygria has grey-green young leaves that unfurl to a mid-green mass; but it comes into its own in autumn, with vivid orange-yellows and reds, and puffs of flowers that turn a smoky grey. You'll find more drama in the claret foliage and purple-pink blooms of C. coggygria 'Royal Purple', while C. coggygria 'Flame' morphs into a great fireball of red in autumn. This shrub will develop into a small tree, but cutting it to the ground in spring keeps it in check and encourages larger leaves. No garden is complete without at least one lilac. Syringa meyeri var. spontanea 'Palibin' grows in any soil; it is almost pest and disease free, and reaches a height and spread of about 1.5m. Lilac pink, scented blooms arrive in profusion in May, after which it can be cut back hard to save on space. <strong>Helpful herbaceous </strong> Bare soil is every gardener's enemy: brown, empty patches of earth are both unsightly and a portal for weeds. Weed-proof membranes and mulches help the fight, but nothing beats a smothering cloak of ground-covering plants. Send in weed-stomping troops of Geranium \u00a5 oxonianum 'Claridge Druce', a vigorous grey-green leaved plant with rose-pink flowers, which will hold its own among the most pernicious of weeds. Sturdy and semi-evergreen, G. macrorrhizum 'Album' not only colours up in autumn to shades of russet and red, but will glimmer with white blooms in the driest, shadiest spots. Other carpeting plants include Symphytum grandiflorum, Vinca minor (I hear Christopher Lloyd cuts his back every three years), Euphorbia amygdaloides var. robbiae and Lysimachia punctata. </p> <p><strong>Swelling numbers</strong></p> <p>Don't forget plants that will produce more of the same for free. Salix alba is an undemanding plant that'll blow you away come winter. S. alba 'Britzensis' has coral-red stems, while S. alba 'Vitellina' has strong limbs in glowing acid-yellow. Cut them back hard each spring for an abundance of young, coloured growths, then use castoffs to produce more plants for perking up your evergreens. Layer shrubs and climbers to stretch plants on walls and in borders without breaking the bank. Jasminum nudiflorum, Akebia quinata, hops, some honeysuckles and most passionflowers can easily be increased by bending flexible limbs to the ground and pegging them in place with a hairpin or wire; they'll root and spread to form dense, bushy masses. </p> <p><strong>Reap what you grow </strong></p> <p>Whatever you grow, make sure you plant things properly. I'm amazed how many plants are bunged in without concern for their health. </p> <p>Dig planting holes shallow and wide (most new root growth is concentrated in the first 15cm of soil), mix compost and fertiliser, then firm the plant in at the same level as it was in its pot. Use at least 5cm of mulch around it to keep water in and weeds out (organic mulch rots into and improves the soil). With forward planning such as this, you'll have a full, easy-maintenance garden for years.</p>",

This shrub will develop into a small tree, but cutting it to the ground in spring keeps it in check and encourages larger leaves. No garden is complete without at least one lilac. Syringa meyeri var. spontanea 'Palibin' grows in any soil; it is almost pest and disease free, and reaches a height and spread of about 1.5m. Lilac pink, scented blooms arrive in profusion in May, after which it can be cut back hard to save on space. Helpful herbaceous Bare soil is every gardener's enemy: brown, empty patches of earth are both unsightly and a portal for weeds. Weed-proof membranes and mulches help the fight, but nothing beats a smothering cloak of ground-covering plants. Send in weed-stomping troops of Geranium \u00a5 oxonianum 'Claridge Druce', a vigorous grey-green leaved plant with rose-pink flowers, which will hold its own among the most pernicious of weeds. Sturdy and semi-evergreen, G. macrorrhizum 'Album' not only colours up in autumn to shades of russet and red, but will glimmer with white blooms in the driest, shadiest spots. Other carpeting plants include Symphytum grandiflorum, Vinca minor (I hear Christopher Lloyd cuts his back every three years), Euphorbia amygdaloides var. robbiae and Lysimachia punctata. Swelling numbers Don't forget plants that will produce more of the same for free. Salix alba is an undemanding plant that'll blow you away come winter. S. alba 'Britzensis' has coral-red stems, while S. alba 'Vitellina' has strong limbs in glowing acid-yellow. Cut them back hard each spring for an abundance of young, coloured growths, then use castoffs to produce more plants for perking up your evergreens. Layer shrubs and climbers to stretch plants on walls and in borders without breaking the bank. Jasminum nudiflorum, Akebia quinata, hops, some honeysuckles and most passionflowers can easily be increased by bending flexible limbs to the ground and pegging them in place with a hairpin or wire; they'll root and spread to form dense, bushy masses. Reap what you grow Whatever you grow, make sure you plant things properly. I'm amazed how many plants are bunged in without concern for their health. Dig planting holes shallow and wide (most new root growth is concentrated in the first 15cm of soil), mix compost and fertiliser, then firm the plant in at the same level as it was in its pot. Use at least 5cm of mulch around it to keep water in and weeds out (organic mulch rots into and improves the soil). With forward planning such as this, you'll have a full, easy-maintenance garden for years.",

They devoured drink, drugs and wee lassies by the ton. The one thing that inspired them was tribal loyalty: they stuck together like - well, like glue. Welsh's publishers call his new novel Glue \"a return to form\", which is something of a backhanded compliment. What they probably mean is a return to Trainspotting . </p> <p>The old crew - Begbie, Sick Boy, Spud and Renton - make tantalising cameo appearances in Glue , and are known to its protagonists. Begbie is currently picking the pockets of gullible Americans in the bars of Leith, you'll be interested to learn. Renton was recently spotted on a Glasgow train. He's back from Amsterdam, and is thought to be working in the music business. His reputation goes before him, though: \"He ripped off his mates.\" Who cares that they ripped off everybody else? </p> <p> Trainspotting had a disjointed structure which suited its zonked-out state of mindlessness, and emphasised the characters' lack of connection to anything except each other. Glue, by contrast, is carefully crafted. It employs multiple perspective, and skilfully plays with a form of narrative rewind, whereby a fuzzy incident in chapter six, say, is replayed, gaining definition, in chapter nine. Welsh flits between standard English, in which he is not entirely comfortable (\"Davie felt like a newly crowned emperor surveying his fiefdom\", to cite but one peculiar phrase), and the more expressive but limited schemie demotic, in which he is fluent - is, in fact, the lad himself. </p> <p> Glue has an epic scale: it charts the rites of passage from boyhood to ladhood (no Welsh character has progressed beyond the latter) of four friends: Terry, Carl, Billy and Gally. The most powerful element of Welsh's fiction is not the shock factor, which he has made common-place, but its forward momentum. There is a direct route between the imagination and the page, and the writing is highly reader-friendly. This was evident in Welsh's last novel, Filth , where the voice of the diabolical Detective Sergeant Robinson was so well conceived and sustained that participation in his horrific consciousness came to seem like fun. Glue is packed with witty lines and sharp insights into behaviour and landscape. In present-day Glasgow, for example, Carl senses \"disconnected currents of harshness that the new shopping malls and designer boutiques seem to strangely accentuate rather than cover up\". </p> <p>Various plots are kept going from beginning to end, but the main interest is generated by the overlapping lives of the principal characters. Terry is a loveable rogue and a Casanova, apt to thieve from any house he enters, even as a guest; he has never got over being laid off from his early career selling bottles of juice from a van round the schemes. The job provided scope for his seduction technique, astonishingly successful despite a ridiculous hairdo, chronic flatulence and an ever-expanding beer belly. </p> <p>Carl - aka the Milky Bar Kid, aka DJ N-Sign - values character in a girl more than Terry does, though he listens carefully when his mate says \"ye cannae fuck a personality\". He is something of an outsider, being a Hearts fan (the others support Hibs) and coming from a stable family. His skills at the turntable are his passport through life, until he almost surrenders to an overdose of ecstasy and cocaine. Gally is an oversensitive type, who attracts bad luck. He remains a virgin for a preposterously long time (the reluctant female being a rare breed here), and ends up catching Aids from dirty needles and committing suicide. </p> <p>Billy is probably the most plausible stab at a three-dimensional character. Restrained and ambitious, he makes the grade as a professional boxer before retiring to run a profitable city-centre bar. Billy keeps his aptitude for violence under control. His squeamish side comes out when, in the course of a burglary, the ringleader breaks the legs of a couple of guard dogs, tapes their snouts, strings them over a tree and sets them on fire. \"It wid be kinder for thum tae die,\" reasons Billy as he watches a madman called Doyle torture the dogs. \"Ah jist shrugged. Thir wis nowt any cunt could dae tae stoap Doyle.\" </p> <p>As the lads grow bigger, they naturally wish to broaden their minds by watching football in foreign cities, comparing German beer with McEwan's Export and checking out Australia's suitability for raves. Given Welsh's descriptive talent, there is curiously little feeling for life beyond the schemes (even they are sketchily described). He shares this lack with his characters, for whom other people barely exist. No matter how far afield they travel, Terry, Carl and Gally will never develop the faculty of recognising value in outsiders; others remain the Other. Nor will they ever get the hang of communal life, or - perish the thought - social responsibility. It's handy having public housing, food supplies, airborne transport and medical treatment when you need them, but when Carl's father is taken ill and rushed to hospital, we are hardly surprised to learn that \"the doctors are fuckin wankers\". </p> <p>Central to the world described in Glue are Carl's dad's 10 rules, replacing the clapped-out Ten Commandments: always back up your mates, never cross a picket line, never grass a friend or foe, etc. Mates are everything ( Glue is dedicated to a football quorum of 11 mates). Your mates will back you up when there's a riot at a Hibs v Rangers match - in fact, your mates started it by infiltrating the visitors' end and head-butting every wanker in sight. There are frequent references to Festival tourists, studenty types, rich cunts and people from Glasgow - \"Huns\". No species is more exotic than women, however, who are so Other that they are never simply women. They are rides, cows, slags, hounds, hoors - or, at the upper end of the meat market, quality fanny, premium minge. The occasional glimmers of tenderness in Welsh's many sex scenes are quickly overwhelmed by, for example, a disquisition on a slag's dietary habits evidenced by a bout of anal sex. </p> <p>Late in the novel, a girl gang enters the action, getting a minor storyline to itself. However, in their appetites and instincts, the girls are simply XX-chromosome versions of the lads. \"Cocks oot fir the lassies!\", one of them shouts at \"two young studenty guys\" on a train. The lassies are back from Ibiza, and too busy totting up the holiday cock-count to chase \"wee fuckers\" from the world of higher education. Lisa is the champion ride. \"She's some machine,\" says her friend appreciatively. \"Shaggin that boy fae Tranent in the bogs comin back oan the plane.\" Not surprisingly, Lisa will soon discover that \"Terry was a brilliant shag\". </p> <p>The book contains one gesture in the direction of civility.

Get me an autograph.\" I have the sense that he's only half joking.</p> <p>Once upon a time it's unlikely that Cage's name would have excited much interest among LA's airport staff; those jaded gatekeepers used to seeing Hollywood's elite drift through immigration on an almost hourly basis. Back then the actor was embraced by fans as a turbulent cult icon and dismissed by phobes as a showboating brat. The past five years have changed all that. Cage's renaissance kicked off with an Academy Award for his bourbon-soaked performance in Leaving Las Vegas, then built through the runaway box-office of popcorn blockbusters like The Rock, Con Air and Face/Off. These days his image glowers down from a billboard atop Sunset Boulevard and the local TV network trails its celebrity news with a clip of the man brandishing his Oscar. In Hollywood terms Nicolas Cage has arrived. The 37 year-old currently resides in that rarefied $20m bracket inhabited only by the select few (Cruise, Hanks, Carrey, Roberts). But he reached the summit via the scenic route. His eccentric, freewheeling picaresque would have landed most other actors on the scrap-heap. </p> <p>Our meeting is scheduled for 10am Sunday morning when Cage shows up, alert and ready to go, with 15 minutes to spare. In he comes, every inch your money movie star with his electric-blue suit, gym-slim torso and brisk pump of a handshake. And yet no amount of Beverly Hills grooming can quite plane down the man's rough edges. If your archetypal Hollywood player is compact and symmetrical in the flesh, Cage cuts a more outsize, Fauvist figure. The face is raw-boned, lugubrious; the hair perched high on a heavy forehead. \"I feel like a modern actor, though some people have told me I look like I'm from medieval times,\" he remarks at one point. His voice is that of a stoner Elvis Presley.</p> <p>But then Cage has always been a bit of a mongrel: part Italian-American primitive, part indulged Hollywood prince, with a well-connected uncle in Francis Ford Coppola. Fittingly his films provide a jumble of extremes. In the early years the dark stuff dominated. The young Cage set out his stall with angsty, oddball roles as a Vietnam casualty in Birdy, a goofy repeat offender in Raising Arizona and the volatile, chain-smoking Sailor Ripley in David Lynch's Wild at Heart. At that time the exotic stylings easily dwarfed his more palatable, mainstream choices (Moonstruck, Peggy Sue Got Married). Recently the balance has swung to a more even keel. So Cage will tackle the scuzzy noir thriller 8mm and Martin Scorsese's anguished Bringing Out the Dead and then compensate with the homespun feel-goodisms of Family Man and the sun-dappled sweep of his latest picture, Captain Corelli's Mandolin. </p> <p>\"I think I'm probably a little more comfortable playing the dark stuff,\" he admits. \"But I know that if you don't do something light every now and then the dark will envelop everything and I'll be typecast as this dark, brooding, angry guy.\" Maybe he's mellowing. \"When I started out I was really adamant about being a punk-rock kind of actor. I remember when I did Moonstruck I just hated myself for being in that movie because it was such a celebration of life. Now, of course, I look at Moonstruck and think: Oh, it's wonderful. What was I thinking? Why was I so angry? What was wrong with me?\" These are questions he returns to, worrying at them, at various intervals throughout the interview.</p> <p>Let's assume, then, that Captain Corelli's Mandolin is the sort of picture that the Cage of old would have run a mile from. An overhaul of the Louis De Bernieres best-seller, it's an epic, old-school wartime romance; an expert weave of glittering Greek scenery, tumbling rustic comedy and high-flown declarations of love. Off-screen matters were more fractious. During the shoot Cage's five year marriage to actress Patricia Arquette sputtered to a halt (divorce papers were submitted, withdrawn and then submitted again). Meantime the news wires hummed with rumours of an on-set affair with his Spanish co-star Penelope Cruz. The film's director, Britain's John Madden, now dismisses such talk as simple tabloid froth. \"It's absolute bullshit,\" he tells me. \"Penelope and Nic became very good friends but certainly not lovers on the film.\" Then comes an abrupt caveat: \"But their private lives are their business.\"</p> <p>For his part Cage is happier keeping off the personal issues. Artistically Captain Corelli's Mandolin was a stretch for him, he says. He normally feels more comfortable playing Americans, playing modern-day, and yet here he was as Corelli, a flamboyant Italian soldier (complete with sing-song Cornetto accent) adrift in 1940s Greece. On the other hand the role gave him the opportunity to connect with his ancestry, to feel his way into past generations. \"If you allow me to be slightly metaphysical for a second I was trying to call upon the spirit of my dead grandfather, Carmine Coppola. I didn't spend that much time with my grandfather, but here I was in front of a 35mm camera and I would say: Come on Carmine. Get me through this.\" What was that like? \"Wonderful,\" he says.</p> <p>So alright then. Cage found the film a challenge, a move into uncharted acting territory. Others, though, might be more sceptical. There have been suggestions that the man runs the risk of selling himself short with such mainstream forays. A year or two back Sean Penn was acid in his criticism; taking Cage to task over the increasing number of action blockbusters that crop up on his CV. At the time there was some confusion over exactly what was said. For the record, Penn never directly dismissed his fellow actor as a \"sell-out\". What he said was that: \"Nic Cage is no longer an actor. He's more like a performer.\" On another occasion he was generally assumed to be referring to Cage's action-laden Con Air when he remarked that: \"If there's anything more disgusting in the movie business it's the whoredom of my peers. It's a guy's arm coming out of the screen [and] jerking you off. I prefer to do it myself at home than have some guy contriving wet dreams for me.\"</p> <p>Cage would rather not get into a slanging match with Penn. After all, the pair were once firm friends. They acted together as youngsters, hung out off-set and their subsequent rise through the ranks shows them to be more similar than otherwise (two Hollywood kids with something of the roughneck about them). Still, the attack clearly rankles: \"He's paying a little too much attention to my career, I think. I'm not thinking too much about what he's doing, you know. But he never said that I was a sell-out, so I don't know where that came from, OK? I had heard those words but not from him. But what he did say was that I wasn't an actor, and I can't agree with that. That's Sean's opinion and he's entitled to it. But for me acting has always been an expression, in any format. I happen to like action movies. For me that's a legitimate expression.\"</p> <p>Perhaps it all comes down to a question of taste. Penn's comments, I say, were presumably based on the belief that you can be an actor or a movie star, but you can't be both. Until now Cage has kept his cool. With this he almost explodes out of his seat. \"I think that's so absurd. It's just absurd. All of my favourite actors were movie stars. What makes a movie star is somebody who is inimitable, whose voices you can imitate. Humphrey Bogart. James Cagney. Marlon Brando. Clint Eastwood. They're fascinating to watch and listen to. That doesn't make them bad actors. That just makes them inimitable and idiosyncratic and unique.\" Of course it can also make them extremely wealthy into the bargain, if they choose the right projects (or wrong ones, depending on your position). Take Cage, who pocketed a reported $20m for his turn in last year's Gone in 60 Seconds, an airbrushed cannonball run of a movie that can hardly have dug deep at his reserves of talent. I wonder if money is important to him. \"Well, money's always important,\" he shrugs. \"It enables you to live a certain lifestyle that you want. And if I told you that money isn't important, like some actors will, then I would be full of shit.\"</p> <p>Later on, still trying to pin down the man's motivations, I ask Cage to list what he reckons are his three most important movies. He names Wild at Heart, Mike Figgis's Leaving Las Vegas and Con Air, the film that so annoyed Penn. When I comment that this last one seems an unusual choice, Cage rolls his eyes skyward. \"Why, because two are artistic and one is commercial? Why can't a commercial movie be artistic? They can be, you know. I hate those distinctions.\"</p> <p>Some clues to Cage current state - this cocktail of action heroics and Methody madness, of insider gloss and rude native energy - can be found in his childhood. He was born Nicolas Kim Coppola to an artistic middle-class family (dad August a professor in comparative literature, mum Joy a dancer and choreographer) and raised in a household steeped in books and opera and philosophy. Even as a child August had been a prodigious scholar. Nicolas, by contrast, kicked against conventional education and struggled at school. Instead the boy was a discerning pop-culture junkie; a devourer of Marvel comics, Bond movies and the horror novels of Stephen King. He remembers being six, sitting in front of the TV and furiously conspiring a way to get inside, to make a break from the living-room carpet and slip inside that fuzzy, heightened landscape which flickered behind the glass. That, he says, was when he first decided to become an actor. For Cage this meant Hollywood. Theatre never entered the picture. \"No. And I know it's shocking and how dare I say it. Typical American. But I've just always wanted to be a film actor.\"</p> <p>He was a weird kid, \"spooked\". Most nights he had trouble sleeping. When he did eventually drop off he would be plagued by nightmares. A mannequin would come tapping at his window; a ventriloquist's dummy would swoop in over the bed. \"Those things can be scary,\" he drawls, as though embarrassed at his own timidity. Meanwhile, downstairs, the Coppola home had troubles of its own. Joy suffered from schizophrenic episodes and was institutionalised for much of her son's childhood. The marriage eventually ended when Nic was 12, and he wound up going to live with his dad in San Francisco. </p> <p>Cage's mother has since recovered. Yet you can't help wondering whether her illness had anything to do with his childhood traumas; maybe even with the \"dark stuff\" he's so keen to explore in his work. \"I don't know,\" he says. \"I don't know about that.\" Then he pauses for the longest time. \"I'd hesitate to comment on that because, you know, I think she's been through enough. I mean, I know that people know about it and that she's talked about it. But I'd rather not go down that road, if that's all the same with you.\"</p> <p>As a child Nic Cage would rip open his shirt and roar like the Incredible Hulk to ward off the playground bullies. Years later he would again look to Marvel Comics to kick-start his acting career. He was credited as Nicolas Coppola on his first movie, the 1982 teen romp Fast Times at Ridgemont High. After that he lifted his nom-de-plume from Luke Cage, a militant Afro-American superhero that Marvel developed as an early 70s response to Black Power. At the time he said that this was because he didn't want to be regarded as \"some nepotistic asshole\". Flushed with the success of The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, the Francis Coppola of the early 80s was still widely touted as America's most important film-maker. As a result, the name trailed a lot of baggage with it. </p> <p>\"It was difficult in that I would go into the casting office and I would have all my lines memorised,\" Cage remembers. \"And when you audition for a movie it's an incredibly painful process. You feel so vulnerable and oh, it's dreadful. So I would go in and I would just want to do the scene that I had prepared and I would have to talk about Francis for an hour before I could do the scene, and by then I had lost my whole concept of what I wanted to do. It was like they were just trying to get information. That,\" he finishes dryly, \"was a little hard for me.\"</p> <p>That said, cynics could argue that the name change was merely cosmetic. Certainly the Coppola connection was crucial in sustaining him during that scrambling early dash. In fact, in his first four years in acting Cage made no fewer than three films with Coppola. He was the greaseball rival to Matt Dillon in Rumble Fish, a loutish \"mad dog\" enforcer in the jazz-era folly The Cotton Club and Kathleen Turner's high-school sweetheart turned obnoxious spouse in Peggy Sue Got Married. In this way, Uncle Francis effectively helped Cage get moving. He provided the stabiliser wheels as his young nephew pedalled precariously up the road to glory. </p> <p>By all accounts, the ride was a rocky one. Scarcely out of his teens, Cage was green and gauche and chippy; a surge of unrefined ability. Richard Corliss, the film writer for Time magazine, refers to him as \"a student of the crypto-eccentric school of modern acting\", and reckons that \"some of his early performances were mannerist bordering on the grotesque\". Fired up by the Method school, he would hurl himself headlong at every role, badgering his director with off-the-wall suggestions and carrying the character with him wherever he went. When the part was a dark or violent one, this would cause problems. While making The Cotton Club, Cage would finish a take, then go back and smash up his trailer. There is a story that, one morning, on the way to the set, he suddenly suspected that he was not feeling quite angry enough. To work up the requisite red-cloud-before-the-eyes, he attacked a remote- control car that was being operated by an LA street vendor; broke the thing into little bits. Is this true? \"Yeah,\" says Cage, faintly shame-faced at such brattish behaviour. \"Yeah.\" What did the vendor think of that? </p> <p>\"He didn't like it. Nobody liked it. The whole street parted from one side to the next. People were screaming. Then I would go to work feeling ready to play the part. Conversely, if I was playing a really nice guy, I would have done really nice things.\" What, so you'd have bought the remote-control car? \"Yeah,\" Cage agrees. \"Well, actually, I did buy the car. I smashed it and then I gave him the money.\"</p> <p>Known for staffing his productions with family and friends, Coppola was largely tolerant of his nephew's antics. Others took a dimmer view. Matters reached a head during the 1985 filming of Peggy Sue Got Married. \"I almost got fired off Peggy Sue Got Married,\" Cage recalls, \"which would have been enormously painful. But I didn't want to make that movie, and Francis knew that. I just thought that the character as written was boring, and I told him that I wanted to go pretty far-out with it, and he said okay.\" Cage's concept of \"pretty far-out\" was to hotwire his Joe-Schmo protagonist with an array of tics and twitches, and to deliver his lines in a strangulated whistle. Executives from Tri-Star took one look at the early rushes and flipped. \"The studio came up to fire me. Francis cooked them spaghetti and they ate it and they went home and they didn't fire me. But . . .\" - a gust of breathy laughter - \"I never worked with him again.\" By this point, apparently, even Uncle Francis's patience was at an end.</p> <p>Except that, all of a sudden, it didn't seem to matter any more. Even in such bull-in-a-china-shop mode, Cage had made a big impression. First Alan Parker hired him for Birdy (\"That was the first time anybody really took me seriously as an actor\"). Later, Cher demanded him as her co-star in Moonstruck, and the Coen brothers recruited him to play the baby-snatching hero of Raising Arizona, struggling to lock down his wilful idiosyncrasies yet still coming away with a brilliantly deadpan, disciplined performance. By the time of his extravagant, tour-de-force in 1990's Palme D'Or-winning Wild At Heart, there was a sense that Cage had at last grown into his talent. He was controlling it - as opposed to it controlling him.</p> <p>\"Acting has always been a medicine for me,\" he says. \"It's a way to get this shit out of my system. But you have to learn to control it, or it just invades you. You end up making yourself impossible to live with, and life impossible to live. I look back on those early days and wonder what was the matter.\" </p> <p>He does, however, suggest one culprit. \"I was growing up watching James Dean, and I heard all the stories about him. How he was a pain in the ass as a person, but solid gold on screen. How he would come into a room going, 'Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you'.\" Cage gestures aggressively at invisible guests surrounding us. \"And I thought, 'Is that what you have to do? Is that how you have to be?' And the answer, of course, is no. But tell that to a 17-year-old boy who wants to be an actor. So, yeah, I would trash the trailer, trash the hotel room, all that stuff. But that kind of behaviour at 37 would be really reprehensible.\"</p> <p>David Lynch calls Nic Cage \"the jazz musician of American acting\". In the past, perhaps, his repertoire was mainly limited to variations on either dopey or menacing. But the last decade has seen him hone and expand his repertoire. He has added layers in between, and learnt to sprinkle telling moments of stillness in amid the storms. At times his natural extrovert exuberance can still leave him caught out (he looked ill at ease, for instance, playing the numbed ambulance-driving observer in Scorsese's Bringing Out the Dead). But now the bum notes are few and far between. Since coming of age in public, Cage has blossomed into one of his generation's most potent and compelling performers. Cast him in a mainstream, formula flick and he brings a bracing dose of madness to the role. Fit him inside a dark, quirky movie and he humanises it, keeps it rooted in reality. The wild energies of his formative years have now been harnessed. As a kid he used Hollywood as his playground. As a man he effectively runs the place.</p> <p>The interview is over. In comes Cage's personal assistant to wrap it up, and the two retreat for a hurried conversation in an adjacent room. A moment later she's back again, buttonholing me as I pour a cup of coffee. The personal assistant just wants to make sure that we are crystal clear on the Sean Penn quote; that Penn never actually referred to Nic as a sell-out. No, that's fine, I say. I know that he didn't. I just want you to be absolutely sure, she says again. She cannot stress it enough.</p> <p>By rights this should be Nic Cage's day off. He's currently a month into the filming of Adaptation with Spike Jonze, the maverick director of Being John Malkovich. Jonze is married to Sofia Coppola, the daughter of Francis who is now also a film-maker in her own right. The Coppola connection is still there, it seems. The difference is that now it is Cage who is its fulcrum. In terms of status and visibility, he is the Godfather now. </p> <p>When today's round of interviews are over, a studio car will arrive to stretch-limo the actor back home. Cage's route will lead him up past Hollywood Boulevard, where he has a star on the Walk of Fame, and into the hills where he lives in a faux-Bavarian castle flanked by an army of vintage European sports cars. Tomorrow another limousine will squire him back down to the movie set where he will find his trailer, his entourage and the cameras prepared to catch his next burst of pyrotechnics. Because Hollywood looks after its own, nurtures them and lets them grow. Right now he's one of the biggest fish they've got. </p> <p>\u0095 Captain Corelli's Mandolin is released on May 4.</p>",

So I would go in and I would just want to do the scene that I had prepared and I would have to talk about Francis for an hour before I could do the scene, and by then I had lost my whole concept of what I wanted to do. It was like they were just trying to get information. That,\" he finishes dryly, \"was a little hard for me.\" That said, cynics could argue that the name change was merely cosmetic. Certainly the Coppola connection was crucial in sustaining him during that scrambling early dash. In fact, in his first four years in acting Cage made no fewer than three films with Coppola. He was the greaseball rival to Matt Dillon in Rumble Fish, a loutish \"mad dog\" enforcer in the jazz-era folly The Cotton Club and Kathleen Turner's high-school sweetheart turned obnoxious spouse in Peggy Sue Got Married. In this way, Uncle Francis effectively helped Cage get moving. He provided the stabiliser wheels as his young nephew pedalled precariously up the road to glory. By all accounts, the ride was a rocky one. Scarcely out of his teens, Cage was green and gauche and chippy; a surge of unrefined ability. Richard Corliss, the film writer for Time magazine, refers to him as \"a student of the crypto-eccentric school of modern acting\", and reckons that \"some of his early performances were mannerist bordering on the grotesque\". Fired up by the Method school, he would hurl himself headlong at every role, badgering his director with off-the-wall suggestions and carrying the character with him wherever he went. When the part was a dark or violent one, this would cause problems. While making The Cotton Club, Cage would finish a take, then go back and smash up his trailer. There is a story that, one morning, on the way to the set, he suddenly suspected that he was not feeling quite angry enough. To work up the requisite red-cloud-before-the-eyes, he attacked a remote- control car that was being operated by an LA street vendor; broke the thing into little bits. Is this true? \"Yeah,\" says Cage, faintly shame-faced at such brattish behaviour. \"Yeah.\" What did the vendor think of that? \"He didn't like it. Nobody liked it. The whole street parted from one side to the next. People were screaming. Then I would go to work feeling ready to play the part. Conversely, if I was playing a really nice guy, I would have done really nice things.\" What, so you'd have bought the remote-control car? \"Yeah,\" Cage agrees. \"Well, actually, I did buy the car. I smashed it and then I gave him the money.\" Known for staffing his productions with family and friends, Coppola was largely tolerant of his nephew's antics. Others took a dimmer view. Matters reached a head during the 1985 filming of Peggy Sue Got Married. \"I almost got fired off Peggy Sue Got Married,\" Cage recalls, \"which would have been enormously painful. But I didn't want to make that movie, and Francis knew that. I just thought that the character as written was boring, and I told him that I wanted to go pretty far-out with it, and he said okay.\" Cage's concept of \"pretty far-out\" was to hotwire his Joe-Schmo protagonist with an array of tics and twitches, and to deliver his lines in a strangulated whistle. Executives from Tri-Star took one look at the early rushes and flipped. \"The studio came up to fire me. Francis cooked them spaghetti and they ate it and they went home and they didn't fire me. But . . .\" - a gust of breathy laughter - \"I never worked with him again.\" By this point, apparently, even Uncle Francis's patience was at an end. Except that, all of a sudden, it didn't seem to matter any more. Even in such bull-in-a-china-shop mode, Cage had made a big impression. First Alan Parker hired him for Birdy (\"That was the first time anybody really took me seriously as an actor\"). Later, Cher demanded him as her co-star in Moonstruck, and the Coen brothers recruited him to play the baby-snatching hero of Raising Arizona, struggling to lock down his wilful idiosyncrasies yet still coming away with a brilliantly deadpan, disciplined performance. By the time of his extravagant, tour-de-force in 1990's Palme D'Or-winning Wild At Heart, there was a sense that Cage had at last grown into his talent. He was controlling it - as opposed to it controlling him. \"Acting has always been a medicine for me,\" he says. \"It's a way to get this shit out of my system. But you have to learn to control it, or it just invades you. You end up making yourself impossible to live with, and life impossible to live. I look back on those early days and wonder what was the matter.\" He does, however, suggest one culprit. \"I was growing up watching James Dean, and I heard all the stories about him. How he was a pain in the ass as a person, but solid gold on screen. How he would come into a room going, 'Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you'.\" Cage gestures aggressively at invisible guests surrounding us. \"And I thought, 'Is that what you have to do? Is that how you have to be?' And the answer, of course, is no. But tell that to a 17-year-old boy who wants to be an actor. So, yeah, I would trash the trailer, trash the hotel room, all that stuff. But that kind of behaviour at 37 would be really reprehensible.\" David Lynch calls Nic Cage \"the jazz musician of American acting\". In the past, perhaps, his repertoire was mainly limited to variations on either dopey or menacing. But the last decade has seen him hone and expand his repertoire. He has added layers in between, and learnt to sprinkle telling moments of stillness in amid the storms. At times his natural extrovert exuberance can still leave him caught out (he looked ill at ease, for instance, playing the numbed ambulance-driving observer in Scorsese's Bringing Out the Dead). But now the bum notes are few and far between. Since coming of age in public, Cage has blossomed into one of his generation's most potent and compelling performers. Cast him in a mainstream, formula flick and he brings a bracing dose of madness to the role. Fit him inside a dark, quirky movie and he humanises it, keeps it rooted in reality. The wild energies of his formative years have now been harnessed. As a kid he used Hollywood as his playground. As a man he effectively runs the place. The interview is over. In comes Cage's personal assistant to wrap it up, and the two retreat for a hurried conversation in an adjacent room. A moment later she's back again, buttonholing me as I pour a cup of coffee. The personal assistant just wants to make sure that we are crystal clear on the Sean Penn quote; that Penn never actually referred to Nic as a sell-out. No, that's fine, I say. I know that he didn't. I just want you to be absolutely sure, she says again. She cannot stress it enough. By rights this should be Nic Cage's day off. He's currently a month into the filming of Adaptation with Spike Jonze, the maverick director of Being John Malkovich. Jonze is married to Sofia Coppola, the daughter of Francis who is now also a film-maker in her own right. The Coppola connection is still there, it seems. The difference is that now it is Cage who is its fulcrum. In terms of status and visibility, he is the Godfather now. When today's round of interviews are over, a studio car will arrive to stretch-limo the actor back home. Cage's route will lead him up past Hollywood Boulevard, where he has a star on the Walk of Fame, and into the hills where he lives in a faux-Bavarian castle flanked by an army of vintage European sports cars. Tomorrow another limousine will squire him back down to the movie set where he will find his trailer, his entourage and the cameras prepared to catch his next burst of pyrotechnics. Because Hollywood looks after its own, nurtures them and lets them grow. Right now he's one of the biggest fish they've got. \u0095 Captain Corelli's Mandolin is released on May 4.",

The last - which details the adventures in France of Faulks's eponymous heroine, Miss Gray, during the second world war - will soon be a film, directed by Gillian Armstrong. This adaptation may propel the novel itself to the level of Birdsong , which can only be called a phenomenon. Now, with a surprising shift of novelistic scene, comes On Green Dolphin Street , set mostly in the United States in 1959. </p> <p>It is not wonderful, though I found the story oddly compelling at certain points. Rather as you do with a decent television drama, I turned happily enough to the book every night for several days, wondering what would happen next. My hunch is that this is where the secret of Faulks's success with readers lies: he makes one interested in his characters and their fates, however stereotyped. He does this by dwelling on their vulnerabilities, while hinting at their secret strengths. There is a powerful tendency to \"identify\" with such characters, as all gifted storytellers know - especially those who focus on genre fiction. </p> <p> On Green Dolphin Street rises several steps above the cheap romance novel. The plot, certainly, would be familiar to devotees of that genre: a bored housewife, married to a charming but neurotic drunk, with two lovely children, falls for a divorced newspaper reporter. She has a surreptitious affair with him, hiding her activities, more or less successfully, until the end. The husband cracks up from drink and depression. Out of pity more than love, she goes back to him, sacrificing her new-found happiness because, well, she must. It's the right thing to do. </p> <p>There is more, of course, and that's where Faulks lays claim to being a genuinely interesting writer. As he showed rather triumphantly in Birdsong , he can summon a particular time and place with considerable skill, deftly relating individual stories to a broader historical scene. Although he often relies on period clich\u00e9s -as when evoking life in the muddy trenches of the first world war - he understands their power and milks the drama in them for what it is worth. His flashes forward to the 1970s in Birdsong seemed pale and tedious by comparison, and one longed to get back to the trenches. </p> <p> On Green Dolphin Street is another attempt to call forth a period in history, and a special place. As the novel opens, it is 1959 in Washington. Charlie van der Linden is a British diplomat, an expert in American politics with supposedly close ties to the Kennedy entourage. (The presidential primaries and the election campaign form a backdrop to the novel's progress, culminating in the famous television debate between the candidates.) The novel's heroine is Mary van der Linden, a model diplomatic wife who reluctantly packs off her children to boarding schools in Britain. Her husband is a high-flyer in the diplomatic corps who enjoys making up fake quotations from Wallace Stevens and Emily Dickinson; he also smokes and drinks with suicidal abandon. Frank Renzo, who becomes Mary's lover, is described as a \"tall, lean man, his cropped hair showing the first dust of grey; his accent was from the urban midwest\". I'm an American, married to a woman from the urban midwest, but I would not recognise such an accent. </p> <p>Mary is nicely drawn, and the flashbacks to her first love affair during the war with a man later killed in action are memorable. Charlie, whose alcoholism is wrenchingly dramatised, lingers in the mind as a vivid character. Mary's dying mother and grieving father in London are movingly portrayed, too. The problem comes with the novelist's portrait of America and Americans. I found myself so distracted by minor errors that my involvement in the plot was frequently interrupted, and I began to doubt that any of the details were right. For example, Charlie is often seen gulping Tylenols to soothe a hangover, though anyone who lived through that era knows that Tylenols didn't exist then. Faulks appears to believe that John Kennedy went to law school (as did his brothers, Robert and Ted), and that the man who moderated the Nixon-Kennedy debate was called Howard Smith, when - as every American knows - this famous television presenter was always referred to as Howard K Smith. (I'm not being petty: to call him Howard Smith is like referring to FDR as FR.) I could multiply examples, but won't bother. </p> <p>Faulks has an unfortunate tendency to rely on stereotypes to evoke an American scene. One example will suffice: Frank Renzo has supposedly been demoted at his newspaper for his coverage of a racist killing in Mississippi - the Emmett Till case, which is well known. In setting the scene, Faulks writes: \"Frank noticed that almost all the local men seemed to be armed. Old boys in stray hats sitting on the verandah had shotguns across their knees; twin barrels poked from farm debris in the back of a pick-up truck; even in the grey brick courthouse, he saw more than one pearl handle sticking out from a straining waistband.\" What's wrong with this scene? For a start, it relies on every hackneyed image one could imagine. The \"old boys\" are not, as British readers might guess, Old Etonians. They are \"good old boys\". The pearl handles in the courthouse seem better suited to a Western than southern film. </p> <p>Suffice it to say, no American reader will find this scene anything but parodic. Nor will they swallow many of the attempts at reproducing American vernacular, as when Charlie asks a couple of Americans what they are drinking and they reply \"Martini\", when they would say \"Martinis\". This is small stuff, but novels are made of small stuff like this. Faulks obviously needs to spend more time watching American television shows. </p> <p>On the other hand, I frequently found myself writing \"good!\" in the margins, as when Mary's mother, Elizabeth, dies at home, and she and her father go into the sitting room to remember her. \"They talked with a candour induced by the knowledge that there was nothing left to conceal; they remembered what Elizabeth had been like, what they had loved about her and what they had never understood, the mysterious motivations, the corrugations of her individual temperament. For long periods, they were quiet, exhausted, but with a sense that something had happened in its proper place; they were made silent by awe.\" It is in moments like this that Faulks does justice to his real talents, lifting the narrative into fresher, headier air. </p> <p>Nobody will mistake On Green Dolphin Street for a work of art, but Mary's internal conflicts - in all their drab ordinariness - are tenderly embodied, while Charlie's existential despair, which alcohol amplifies more than soothes, is movingly rendered. Frank remains cardboard-thin beside the van der Lindens, and I never understood what Mary saw in him. Though entertained, I trolled these pages for those moments of extremely fine perception that make Faulks worth reading. Unfortunately, they were few and far between. </p> <p>Jay Parini's sixth novel, The Apprentice Lover , will appear next year in the US from HarperCollins.</p>",

Old boys in stray hats sitting on the verandah had shotguns across their knees; twin barrels poked from farm debris in the back of a pick-up truck; even in the grey brick courthouse, he saw more than one pearl handle sticking out from a straining waistband.\" What's wrong with this scene? For a start, it relies on every hackneyed image one could imagine. The \"old boys\" are not, as British readers might guess, Old Etonians. They are \"good old boys\". The pearl handles in the courthouse seem better suited to a Western than southern film. Suffice it to say, no American reader will find this scene anything but parodic. Nor will they swallow many of the attempts at reproducing American vernacular, as when Charlie asks a couple of Americans what they are drinking and they reply \"Martini\", when they would say \"Martinis\". This is small stuff, but novels are made of small stuff like this. Faulks obviously needs to spend more time watching American television shows. On the other hand, I frequently found myself writing \"good!\" in the margins, as when Mary's mother, Elizabeth, dies at home, and she and her father go into the sitting room to remember her. \"They talked with a candour induced by the knowledge that there was nothing left to conceal; they remembered what Elizabeth had been like, what they had loved about her and what they had never understood, the mysterious motivations, the corrugations of her individual temperament. For long periods, they were quiet, exhausted, but with a sense that something had happened in its proper place; they were made silent by awe.\" It is in moments like this that Faulks does justice to his real talents, lifting the narrative into fresher, headier air. Nobody will mistake On Green Dolphin Street for a work of art, but Mary's internal conflicts - in all their drab ordinariness - are tenderly embodied, while Charlie's existential despair, which alcohol amplifies more than soothes, is movingly rendered. Frank remains cardboard-thin beside the van der Lindens, and I never understood what Mary saw in him. Though entertained, I trolled these pages for those moments of extremely fine perception that make Faulks worth reading. Unfortunately, they were few and far between.

      "body": "<p>If you are one of the many people languishing on your lender's base mortgage or standard variable rate (SVR) because you think it would cost too much time or money to remortgage, then think again. </p> <p>Just make a phone call, fill in a few forms, and you could be hundreds or even thousands a year better off. </p> <p>In the past five years only 12% of consumers have switched lender, according to the Department of Trade and Industry. This compares to 53% of motorists who have swapped car insurance and 30% of consumers who have switched home insurance. </p> <p>Remortgaging can be used to raise capital or even wipe out debts. And it's easy, according to advisers. </p> <p>Lenders should be able to kit you out with your new mortgage within four to six weeks. Some, like <a href=\"http://www.woolwich-intermediaries.co.uk/\">Woolwich</a>, even offer a rapid remortgaging service which keeps paperwork to a minimum. </p> <p>Your first port of call should be your existing lender, as you may be able to negotiate a better rate without having to pay any fees. Also try rival banks and building societies and ring around the mortgage brokers. </p> <p>But you must do your sums to see if a switch makes sense for you. A lower interest rate elsewhere may be enticing, but it will not be worth making the switch if you have to stump up a hefty redemption penalty to get out of your current deal. </p> <p>You must also factor in all the charges involved in setting up a new mortgage. You can expect to pay fees of around \u00a3900 when you remortgage for \u00a3100,000 - \u00a3250 in valuation fees, \u00a3300 in solicitor's fees and \u00a3300 for the lender's arrangement fee. You may also be asked to pay the mortgage indemnity premium which protects the lender if you fall behind with your repayments, a deeds release fee of \u00a350 and a funds transfer fee of \u00a325. </p> <p>A growing number of lenders are paying these costs themselves to attract more customers, but it is usually at the expense of the interest rate they offer. Again, do your sums before choosing a fees-free deal. </p> <p>If a borrower with an interest-only loan of \u00a350,000 were to remortgage an SVR of 7.24% with no redemption penalties to the <a href=\"http://www.woolwich-intermediaries.co.uk/\">Halifax's </a>base rate tracker, which has a current pay rate of 5.45%, they would save about \u00a31,790 in interest during the first two years. </p> <p>If they had to pay all the remortgage fees mentioned above, the interest saving would fall to \u00a3865 during the first two years. </p> <p>The impact of fees means you should go for a fees-free deal if you are remortgaging for less than \u00a3100,000. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.alliance-leicester-group.co.uk/\">Alliance &amp; Leicester's</a> two-year discount mortgage, which has a current payable rate of 5.24%, no arrangement fee and free valuation, as well as \u00a3250 cashback. </p> <p>With another interest rate cut on the cards some time this year, perhaps you are waiting to see what happens - don't, say brokers. </p> <p>If you sit tight you could be stuck on your lender's SVR for a further six months. </p> <p>There already deals where future rate cuts have been factored in, such as GMAC's two-year fixed rate mortgage which has a payable rate of 4.99%. But this is only available to the cash rich - you have to stump up a deposit of 25%. The arrangement fee is \u00a3295 and there is a 5% redemption penalty in the fixed term. </p> <p>London &amp; Country recommends <a href=\"http://www.britannicmoney.com/\">Britannic Money's</a> 5.35% fixed-rate mortgage, which has no penalties at any time as well as a contribution towards valuation, free legal fees and no arrangement fee.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you are one of the many people languishing on your lender's base mortgage or standard variable rate (SVR) because you think it would cost too much time or money to remortgage, then think again. Just make a phone call, fill in a few forms, and you could be hundreds or even thousands a year better off. In the past five years only 12% of consumers have switched lender, according to the Department of Trade and Industry. This compares to 53% of motorists who have swapped car insurance and 30% of consumers who have switched home insurance. Remortgaging can be used to raise capital or even wipe out debts. And it's easy, according to advisers. Lenders should be able to kit you out with your new mortgage within four to six weeks. Some, like Woolwich, even offer a rapid remortgaging service which keeps paperwork to a minimum. Your first port of call should be your existing lender, as you may be able to negotiate a better rate without having to pay any fees. Also try rival banks and building societies and ring around the mortgage brokers. But you must do your sums to see if a switch makes sense for you. A lower interest rate elsewhere may be enticing, but it will not be worth making the switch if you have to stump up a hefty redemption penalty to get out of your current deal. You must also factor in all the charges involved in setting up a new mortgage. You can expect to pay fees of around \u00a3900 when you remortgage for \u00a3100,000 - \u00a3250 in valuation fees, \u00a3300 in solicitor's fees and \u00a3300 for the lender's arrangement fee. You may also be asked to pay the mortgage indemnity premium which protects the lender if you fall behind with your repayments, a deeds release fee of \u00a350 and a funds transfer fee of \u00a325. A growing number of lenders are paying these costs themselves to attract more customers, but it is usually at the expense of the interest rate they offer. Again, do your sums before choosing a fees-free deal. If a borrower with an interest-only loan of \u00a350,000 were to remortgage an SVR of 7.24% with no redemption penalties to the Halifax's base rate tracker, which has a current pay rate of 5.45%, they would save about \u00a31,790 in interest during the first two years. If they had to pay all the remortgage fees mentioned above, the interest saving would fall to \u00a3865 during the first two years. The impact of fees means you should go for a fees-free deal if you are remortgaging for less than \u00a3100,000. Alliance &amp; Leicester's two-year discount mortgage, which has a current payable rate of 5.24%, no arrangement fee and free valuation, as well as \u00a3250 cashback. With another interest rate cut on the cards some time this year, perhaps you are waiting to see what happens - don't, say brokers. If you sit tight you could be stuck on your lender's SVR for a further six months. There already deals where future rate cuts have been factored in, such as GMAC's two-year fixed rate mortgage which has a payable rate of 4.99%. But this is only available to the cash rich - you have to stump up a deposit of 25%. The arrangement fee is \u00a3295 and there is a 5% redemption penalty in the fixed term. London &amp; Country recommends Britannic Money's 5.35% fixed-rate mortgage, which has no penalties at any time as well as a contribution towards valuation, free legal fees and no arrangement fee.",

It is a Michaelmas daisy with a difference, having quite large mauve flowers on stems that branch only towards the top. </p> <p>I have been discussing with a designer friend how best to use it effectively in the garden, and he suggests having a purple-leaved cotinus behind it, Cotinus coggygria 'Royal Purple'. Grown entirely for its foliage, which is paddle shaped and magnificently translucent when backlit by sunshine, this fast-growing shrub can (and should) be pruned back hard each winter, which both limits its size and produces the best leaves.</p> <p>Now for a partner by the side or in front of the aster. My designer friend thought of Coreopsis verticillata (0.7m), which has a wiry, upright habit, elegant, finely divided leaves and lots of bright, slightly acid, yellow daisies. That would look fine at the start of the aster's flowering season, but would rather leave it in the lurch later on. The same with the crocosmias that we thought of. Whether these flower early or late, it is not for anything like as long a period as the aster's. </p> <p>\"How about Kniphofia 'Brimstone'?\" offered my friend. It is a dwarf poker with very pretty pale-yellow flowers, and the upright habit would be in excellent contrast with the aster's. But really, it flowers too late - not till the end of September - and its lank foliage would hardly enliven the scene during the previous two months. But 'Little Maid', another kniphofia of dwarf habit, flowers over quite a long period - from mid-August - and has creamy-white colouring. As with many other perennials, its flowering season is greatly extended if it is rejuvenated, in this case by splitting and replanting in improved soil every two or three years. It is worth making the point that while many kniphofias make a terrific but short-lived display in one burst of blossom, there are others, like 'Little Maid', that offer continuity. </p> <p>Another thought for a partner on the other side of the aster was Caryopteris x clandonensis 'Worcester Gold'. The main attraction in this shrub is its lime-green foliage, which lasts for a very long time. In August, the shrub carries its clusters of small, blue flowers all along the young shoots. I am generally not too keen on blue and mauve together, but the foliage would redeem that in this case. </p> <p>Caryopteris belong to that group of summer- and autumn-flowering shrubs that you can prune hard all over each spring. In this case you would gauge the height you wanted and prune accordingly, keeping the shrub down to a maximum of one metre. </p> <p>It is fun to work out possible plantings like this, even if you never put them into practice. Someone else can and they may improve on your ideas. I should like to get the rather late-flowering bulb, Nerine bowdenii (0.7m) near to this grouping. It has heads of bright-pink flowers, the petals with wavy margins making open trumpets, from September onwards. It remains more or less dormant in summer, returning to life by flowering when awakened by early autumn rains. If these fail to materialise, you can speed things up by applying a heavy dose of water yourself. </p> <p> Readers can order Christopher Lloyd's Garden Flowers for \u00a314.99 (rrp \u00a318.99), The Well Tempered Garden for \u00a321 (rrp \u00a325, published May 3), or both for \u00a333.99 (saving \u00a310), by calling CultureShop on freephone 0800 316 6102.</p>",

The second was that her aunt had died, leaving her \u00a3500 a year. \"Of the two - the vote and the money - the money, I own, seemed infinitely more important,\" she recalled. </p> <p>It meant no more kindergarten teaching, no more making artificial flowers, no more cadging odd jobs off newspapers, and the freedom to write.</p> <p>Little has changed since Woolf commented that \"a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\". The reality for most writers, male and female, is that money - and the space and time it buys - is a constant, nagging preoccupation. Get any of us together in the bar and you'll find us talking not about who's tipped for the next Orange Prize, but plain old-fashioned dosh.</p> <p>Money, space and time: of these three sacred \"musts\", most writers agree that the problem of space is the easiest to ignore. Want to be a writer? Easy: you can take a laptop, or a scrap of paper and a pen anywhere. You can write standing up, like Ernest Hemingway, or in the family sitting room, like Jane Austen. You can write at a bus stop, on the beach or in the loo. Hell, you can even write when you're meant to be producing Blue Peter: according to urban myth, when the computer system at the BBC was changed some years ago, 75 unfinished novels were found floating in the system. </p> <p>Writing may be one of the most portable activities in the world, but it doesn't stop writers yearning for a private space in which to plumb the depths of their subconscious. The psychologist Martin Lloyd-Elliott, who works with many artists and writers, says that one reason the garret has become central to the mythology of the creative process is because outsiders imbue it with a kind of magic. Literary tourists, he points out, always flock to see The Desk where a great work was penned. Readers will often shyly confess to picturing writers tormented, scribbling in an ivory tower, or holed up in a windswept hotel with a bottle of Scotch. </p> <p>\"But it's also about the writer's preoccupation with the environment being 'just right' for the alchemy to work,\" says Lloyd-Elliott. \"Some writers can only write upstairs. The journey may represent a passage from the ordinary place to this special elevated place in the clouds.\" According to Lorrie Mack, author of Calm Working Spaces, the garret myth springs from the idea that art should involve suffering, \"that out of deprivation and pain is born artistry. So the garret is an attic that's uncomfortable and cold: if you're suffering, you're in a better position to produce great work. Not a view I subscribe to.\"</p> <p>The modern-day work space is more about comfort, light, and the absence of distractions. You can set up a work space anywhere in the home, from a converted attic or garage, to a prefab at the bottom of the garden. But for anyone wanting to concentrate, the absence of mental clutter is the key. Start polluting your work space with other parts of your life and its mystique is shattered.</p> <p>Even mundane disturbances can be galling. Jonathan Coe rents an office near his home in London, but admits to finding himself distracted by the constant demands of phone and fax: he escaped to a villa in Italy to write most of his new novel, The Rotters' Club. Julie Myerson wrote her last two novels, including the current paperback, Laura Blundy, in a flat she and her partner bought up the road, as an investment in lieu of a pension. She has made a point of not taking phone calls there. \"Knowing the phone won't ring is extraordinarily concentrating and calm,\" she says. \"Ten minutes from home is the perfect distance for me. The walk focuses me but never gets dull. Plus, I'm not so close that I'm tempted to pop home.\"</p> <p>Determined to write my fourth novel more quickly than its predecessors, I decided to follow Julie's lead and have a go at garret life. Shelling out more than \u00a3156 rent a week until the book's done is a gamble, but it means I take my studio flat - and the work I do in it - very seriously. A bad day working at home doesn't really cost you, because you can kid yourself you were actually planning to spend the day planting bulbs. Renting a place, you become aware of the need to squeeze every ounce of work from it. It helps you feel more professional: as a writer, you're not a normal person, but sometimes you want to feel like one. Having an office to go to feeds that illusion.</p> <p>Going to Paris may seem quite a schlep to achieve a state of creative nirvana, but novelist Douglas Kennedy has no regrets about buying a garret in St Germain-des-Pr\u00e8s. He loves the city, and finds that the short, intensive bursts of work he does there - one week in every five - are highly productive. \"Family life has a lot of pleasures, but it's intensely distracting,\" he says. \"Writing is a disciplined sport, and the only way you can do it is by getting on with it. I wanted a bolt hole I could get to from London by train. I can get door-to-door in four hours. It's no further than a country cottage in Norfolk.\"</p> <p>Thanks to the instant concentration the garret provides, he wrote and edited much of his new novel, The Pursuit Of Happiness, there. His day begins with coffee and 500 words. Then a shower, a 90-minute French lesson, lunch, a walk, then another burst of writing between four and seven. He works on a laptop, and emails chapters to London as backup, before heading off to one of the arrondissement's cinemas. </p> <p>A friend spotted the garret in an estate agent's and alerted him to it. He didn't fall in love with it right away, but the price was compelling. Here was an apartment in the heart of the Parisian equivalent of Chelsea for the price of a studio in Croydon. It was designer David Bentheim (responsible for Kennedy's London home) who persuaded him of its potential, and turned the 7m x 3m room, plus small kitchen and bathroom, into a home. \"It's a real writer's place,\" says Kennedy, \"but it has comfort, too. I'm very conscious of my good fortune.\"</p> <p>Kennedy is equally conscious of the thing that hits all of us garret-workers as we open the door and sit down to work: a Woolfian \"room of one's own\" might be magical, but it's not magic. It won't write the book for you. In that, you really are on your own</p> <p><strong>The right setting</strong><br></p> <p>Any romantic fantasies you harbour about producing the grand oeuvre will soon fade if you end up with headaches and stiffness rather than inspired prose. For a comfortable work space, and the optimum flow of creative juices, make sure the three basic elements are all taken care of. </p> <p><strong>The chair</strong></p> <p>If you sit at a desk for long periods, you need purpose-designed seating: a borrowed dining chair will not do. Look for one with all-over padding and fully adjustable bits, so you can change the seat height and angle.

For stability, look for one with five legs that radiate from a central pedestal. </p> <p><strong>The desk</strong></p> <p>If you don't fancy a conventional desk, consider building a deep, wide shelf into an alcove (or even right across a small box room), or use a sturdy kitchen table. Make sure it's large enough for all your equipment, with plenty of room for work in progress; there are few things that hamper work as much as untidiness and overcrowding. </p> <p><strong>The lighting</strong></p> <p>Choose an adjustable work light, not a table lamp, to focus on your task; its bulb should be at least 60 watts. To avoid getting in the way of the light, place it at (or above) the opposite side of your work surface to your dominant hand (on the left if you're right-handed and vice versa). Don't let it reflect onto your computer screen.

      "bodyText": "One day the young Virginia Woolf was greeted by two pieces of news. The first was that women were finally to get the vote. The second was that her aunt had died, leaving her \u00a3500 a year. \"Of the two - the vote and the money - the money, I own, seemed infinitely more important,\" she recalled. It meant no more kindergarten teaching, no more making artificial flowers, no more cadging odd jobs off newspapers, and the freedom to write. Little has changed since Woolf commented that \"a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\". The reality for most writers, male and female, is that money - and the space and time it buys - is a constant, nagging preoccupation. Get any of us together in the bar and you'll find us talking not about who's tipped for the next Orange Prize, but plain old-fashioned dosh. Money, space and time: of these three sacred \"musts\", most writers agree that the problem of space is the easiest to ignore. Want to be a writer? Easy: you can take a laptop, or a scrap of paper and a pen anywhere. You can write standing up, like Ernest Hemingway, or in the family sitting room, like Jane Austen. You can write at a bus stop, on the beach or in the loo. Hell, you can even write when you're meant to be producing Blue Peter: according to urban myth, when the computer system at the BBC was changed some years ago, 75 unfinished novels were found floating in the system. Writing may be one of the most portable activities in the world, but it doesn't stop writers yearning for a private space in which to plumb the depths of their subconscious. The psychologist Martin Lloyd-Elliott, who works with many artists and writers, says that one reason the garret has become central to the mythology of the creative process is because outsiders imbue it with a kind of magic. Literary tourists, he points out, always flock to see The Desk where a great work was penned.

The carders will face fines of up to \u00a35,000 and six months in prison after the House of Lords approves amendments to the government's criminal justice and police bill next week. Peers are also to be asked to close a loophole in the law to strengthen the power of the police to close crack houses and prosecute the owners. City centre councils, particularly in London, have unsuccessfully waged a long battle to tackle the problem of prostitutes' cards in phone boxes. The only law that can be used against the carders is an obscure part of town and country planning legislation which makes it a civil offence to put up unauthorised adverts. Repeated attempts have failed to persuade the telephone authorities to cut off the phone lines of numbers advertised on the cards. The new law will make it a criminal offence to place an advertisement for prostitutes' services in a phone box.

In his report Most Wanted - The Quiet Birth of the Free Worker , he describes free workers as the \"expert pollen of the new economy, moving quickly between jobs and assignments\".

Ben Copsey develops internet software and is studying for an MA in electronic arts.

It's an environment stripped of the meaningless gestures of the 'new' corporate world such as the unused pool table.\" </p> <p>Some old economy industries are already working along the lines of the brothel model, though they probably wouldn't thank you for the comparison. \"The film industry is the quintessential networking industry,\" says John Knell. \"Producers and directors use their connections, reputations and networks to pull together groups of like-minded individuals to work on projects.\" </p> <p>There are also similarities with barristers, where legal chambers own the brand and provide administration, but barristers charge their services out to clients.

We can offer them work satisfaction, autonomy within a community of excellence and a sane balance between work and home life. \"If someone is ten times as productive as a staff member at a competitor company, it's crazy not to do whatever it takes to keep them happy, even if it means they want to spend three months a year snowboarding.\"",

It doesn't seem real,\" Mr Stamper told the Mail reporter.</p> <p>It was not real. Yesterday the newspaper and ITV were left wondering whether they had offered their money wisely when the story exploded in their face as Mr Stamper was declared by the public health laboratory to have tested negative.</p> <p>The Mail was not responding to calls yesterday.</p> <p>The scare story has consumed the tabloids for almost a week. But eight of the 13 people tested so far by the public health laboratory for foot and mouth have proved negative.</p> <p>\"It is very unlikely that any of the eight people we have tested are human cases of foot and mouth disease,'' said a spokesman for the laboratory. \"But to exclude any possibility of infection, antibody tests need to be conducted on blood samples.''</p> <p>Tests on saliva, blood and blister fluid samples from the five other cases are continuing. It was good news for tourism chiefs contemplating more negative publicty. The minister of agriculture, Nick Brown, said: \"I am delighted he has been given the all-clear. Otherwise this could have had serious implications for his future employment.''</p> <p>Mr Stamper could not be contacted yesterday, but was said by friends also to be delighted. Whether his all-clear means he can still be paid for his story remains to be seen, and may put a dampener on his celebrations.</p> <p>Hundreds of people have contacted their doctors in the belief that they may have foot and mouth, and could earn a bit of extra cash. The public health laboratory would not say yesterday what the tests on the eight had shown, but it has said that people could be confusing an unrelated but common disease in children called hand foot and mouth with the animal version.</p> <p>There has been only one confirmed case in Britain of a human infected with foot and mouth, during the outbreak in 1967. The Department of Health has said that it expects one or two cases this time.</p> <p>As in sheep, which are thought barely to notice they have the disease, foot and mouth is very mild in humans. The main symptoms are tingling hands, a sore throat and blisters on the tongue or feet. People can theoretically be infected though skin wounds, by handling diseased stock or by drinking infected milk, but not by eating meat from infected animals.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,474590,00.html\">Explained: vaccination</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/0,6514,180991,00.html\">Explained: the risk to human health</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">Explained: pigswill's contribution to foot and mouth</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,471911,00.html\">Foot and mouth in Europe</a></p> <p><b>The Phoenix effect</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,479044,00.html\">26.04.2001, comment: Phoenix highlights hypocrisy</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,479026,00.html\">26.04.2001: Animal cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bres: where are they now?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,478959,00.html\">26.04.2001: What does contiguous mean?</a></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,475723,00.html\">20.04.2001: The jab of conscience</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br> </p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a> <b>More on the countryside in crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\">16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html\">Computerised image of the virus</a><br> <b>Cartoons</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,478723,00.html\">26.04.2001: Martin Rowson on the death of satire</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html\">28.03.2001: Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html\">29.03.2001: Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth\">Foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/footandmouth/\">Election 2001: foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\">BSE</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>Net notes</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

      "bodyText": "When a decomposing cow exploded in the face of Cumbrian farmworker Paul Stamper and he later developed blisters on his tongue and numbness in his feet, the media laid siege to his parents' house in Maryport. Mr Stamper contacted his doctor, who said it was not possible to catch the disease, and then called his solicitor. The Daily Mail and ITV's Tonight with Trevor McDonald emerged triumphant from long negotiations, offering a reported \u00a330,000 between them for exclusive interviews with the first Briton in 34 years who appeared to have contracted foot and mouth. \"I can't believe it. It doesn't seem real,\" Mr Stamper told the Mail reporter. It was not real. Yesterday the newspaper and ITV were left wondering whether they had offered their money wisely when the story exploded in their face as Mr Stamper was declared by the public health laboratory to have tested negative. The Mail was not responding to calls yesterday. The scare story has consumed the tabloids for almost a week. But eight of the 13 people tested so far by the public health laboratory for foot and mouth have proved negative. \"It is very unlikely that any of the eight people we have tested are human cases of foot and mouth disease,'' said a spokesman for the laboratory. \"But to exclude any possibility of infection, antibody tests need to be conducted on blood samples.'' Tests on saliva, blood and blister fluid samples from the five other cases are continuing. It was good news for tourism chiefs contemplating more negative publicty. The minister of agriculture, Nick Brown, said: \"I am delighted he has been given the all-clear. Otherwise this could have had serious implications for his future employment.'' Mr Stamper could not be contacted yesterday, but was said by friends also to be delighted. Whether his all-clear means he can still be paid for his story remains to be seen, and may put a dampener on his celebrations. Hundreds of people have contacted their doctors in the belief that they may have foot and mouth, and could earn a bit of extra cash. The public health laboratory would not say yesterday what the tests on the eight had shown, but it has said that people could be confusing an unrelated but common disease in children called hand foot and mouth with the animal version. There has been only one confirmed case in Britain of a human infected with foot and mouth, during the outbreak in 1967. The Department of Health has said that it expects one or two cases this time. As in sheep, which are thought barely to notice they have the disease, foot and mouth is very mild in humans. The main symptoms are tingling hands, a sore throat and blisters on the tongue or feet. People can theoretically be infected though skin wounds, by handling diseased stock or by drinking infected milk, but not by eating meat from infected animals.

      "bodyText": "The injunction against Ulster Television is the latest in a number of gagging orders and arrests under the Official Secrets Act acquired over the past few years by senior Ministry of Defence officials, enthusiastically backed by their secretary of state, Geoff Hoon. Some have been obtained at night and sometimes newspapers have been told they cannot even report the fact they have been gagged. Three out of the MoD's four live court actions - against the Sunday Times, Sunday People and UTV - are designed to prevent the media from reporting the activities of the army's covert force research unit (FRU) in Northern Ireland which is, in effect, being accused of indulging in state-sponsored murders. The MoD says the injunctions are designed to prevent 'possible threats to life' rather than to protect national security. The fourth court action is the continuing - and almost certainly forlorn - attempt by the MoD to prevent the publication in New Zealand of Soldier 5, a book by Mike Coburn, the pseudonym of an SAS soldier who was a member of the ill-fated Bravo Two Zero patrol in the Gulf war. All these legal actions, and others recently dropped, have been sought by what Whitehall insiders describe as an increasing paranoid section in the MoD responsible for special forces. Senior officials and military officers in the section have led fierce opposition in Whitehall to the decision by Stella Rimington, the former head of MI5, to write her memoirs. Also in the past three years the MoD police charged Tony Geraghty, author of The Irish War, and his alleged source, retired army colonel Nigel Wylde, under the secrets act. The charges were eventually dropped. MoD attempts to gag the media flies in the face of a recent ruling by Lord Phillips, Master of the Rolls, according to Whitehall sources, who accuse the ministry of paranoia. Lord Phillips roundly attacked the practice whereby government lawyers obtained broad injunctions preventing the media from publishing information without first getting clearance from the attorney general, Lord Williams. 'It subjects the press to the censorship of the attorney general,' he said. Such a practice, he added, 'results in the imposition of a restriction on the freedom of the press that is disproportionate to any public interest and thus in breach of article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.'",

      "body": "<p>Question: what is the single most valuable piece of property worth owning at the dawn of the information age? Answer: the radio frequencies - the electromagnetic spectrum - over which an increasing amount of communication and commercial activity will be broadcast in the era of wireless communications. Our PCs, palm pilots, wireless internet, cellular phones, pagers, radios and television all rely on the radio frequencies of the spectrum to send and receive messages, pictures, audio, data, etc.</p> <p> Most of us never give the spectrum a passing thought. We regard it, more or less, like the oxygen we breathe, as a free good. In reality, the spectrum is treated as a 'commons' and is controlled and administered by governments who, in turn, license the various radio frequencies to commercial and other institutions for broadcast. In other words, in every country the electromagnetic system is owned by the government on behalf of the people.</p> <p> But now powerful commercial media are seeking to gain total control over the airwaves. Imagine a world in which a handful of global media conglomerates like Vivendi, Sony, BskyB, Disney, and News Corporation own literally all the airwaves all over the planet and trade them back and forth as 'private electronic real estate'. A strategy is beginning to unfold in Washington DC to make that happen.</p> <p> On February 7, 37 leading US economists signed a joint letter asking the federal communications commission (FCC) to allow broadcasters to lease spectrum they currently license from the government in secondary markets. The letter, which went virtually unnoticed by the general public, is the opening salvo in a radical plan to wrest control of the entire spectrum from governments around the world, and make the radio frequencies a private preserve of global media giants. If they succeed, the nation state will have lost one of its last remaining vestiges of real power - the ability to regulate access to broadcast communications within its own geographic borders.</p> <p> This story starts several years ago, when the Progress and Freedom Foundation, a conservative thinktank in Washington with close ties to Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House of Representatives, published The Telecom Revolution: An American Opportunity. The report's authors called for the conversion of the electromagnetic spectrum to private property. Under the plan, broadcasters holding existing licences would be granted title to the spectrum they currently used and would be able to use, develop, sell and trade it as they saw fit. Remaining unused parts of the spectrum would subsequently be sold off to commercial enterprises and be reconstituted as private electronic real estate, while the FCC would be abolished.</p> <p> The study argued that government control of the radio frequencies led to inefficiencies, and that if the spectrum were converted into private electronic real estate that could be exchanged in the marketplace, the invisible hand of supply and demand would dictate the most innovative uses of those frequencies. Congressional hearings were subsequently conducted on the proposal, quickening interest in the plan.</p> <p> Still, the notion of selling off the US airwaves to private commercial interests seemed a bit too ambitious, even for the most experienced Washington corporate lobbyists. Then, less than one month after George Bush assumed the presidency, the letter from the 37 economists turned up on the FCC's doorstep. </p> <p>The new thinking: first, secure a partial privatisation plan, allowing commercial licensees to sell and lease their leased spectrum in secondary markets. Once done, the commercial foundation would be laid for a final conversion from government licensing of the spectrum to a future sell-off to the private sector. Other nations would be encouraged to follow suit and sell off their spectrums to global media companies. If some baulked at the idea of relinquishing control over their airwaves, international trade sanctions could be imposed to force compliance.</p> <p> In the industrial age, exchanging property in markets was the sine qua non of commerce. The role of national governments was to protect property and markets. But in the new commercial world being born, having access to the flow of information in telecommunications networks becomes at least as important as exchanging property in markets.</p> <p>If the radio frequencies of the planet were owned and controlled by global media corporations, how would the billions who live on earth guarantee their most basic right to communicate with one another? In an era where more and more of our daily communications take place in cyberspace, access to the airwaves becomes critical. Of course, those who can pay will be connected. But what about the 62% of people who have never made a telephone call, and the 40% who have no electricity? How will they ever secure access to cyberspace in a world where the admission fee is controlled by a few global media giants?</p> <p> If the flow of human communications is controlled by global media companies, how do we ensure that social and cultural points of view and political expressions that may differ from those of the companies who own the frequencies will be allowed to flow over the spectrum?

Mr Berlusconi, 64, who briefly served as prime minister in 1994, has faced numerous trials connected to his holding company Fininvest. A conviction for false accounting was overturned on appeal.</p> <p> Two convictions for bribing tax collectors and illegal payments to politicians were extinguished when the appeals ran out of time under the statute of limitations.</p> <p> Accusations of false accounting, bribing judges, tax fraud and breaking anti-trust laws are being investigated.</p> <p> The Economist also referred to the pending trial in Sicily of Mr Berlusconi's friend Marcello Dell' Ultri, who is accused of links to Cosa Nostra. Investigations into Mr Berlusconi's alleged mafia links were closed without any charges being brought.</p> <p> Fininvest, which controls Mr Berlusconi's media interests, said in a statement faxed to Reuters that the article contained \"a series of old accusations'' which were \"an insult to truth and intelligence''.</p> <p> \"The Economist offers its readers an exact photocopy of the most infamous calumnies aimed at Fininvest and its founder Silvio Berlusconi in recent times.</p> <p> \"The answer to such a serious libellous action must be left to the courts in which the Economist will be obliged to deliver compensation matching the extent of the harm done.\" The statement did not say whether the case would be brought in the Italian or British courts.</p> <p> The Economist declined to comment on the Fininvest statement except to say that it stood by its story.</p> <p> Many of the allegations have been aired before in Italy, but the British magazine claims to have supporting evidence. The cumulative effect of six pages chronicling 40 years of unanswered questions has had an explosive impact in Italy.</p> <p> Mr Berlusconi has always said the accusations were part of a leftwing conspiracy and the Economist, seen as right wing has not until now been counted among his enemies.</p> <p> Its allegations were splashed across several national newspapers and brandished by the ruling centre-left coalition. \"So even the Economist is communist?\" said Arturo Parisi, leader of the Democrats.</p> <p> Mr Berlusconi's aides dismissed the article as more pap from a biased foreign press.</p> <p> Despite the fuss Mr Berlusconi is still expected to win on May 13. The Opinion polls suggested that the government has narrowed but failed to erase the gap in time to stop a remarkable comeback.</p> <p> Mr Berlusconi's coalition would take 47.7% of the vote and the government 43.2% if the election was held immediately, a poll in yesterday's La Stampa found. Today is the last day polls can be published under election laws.</p> <p> The key to the centre-right's advantage is the north, where an alliance with the anti-immigrant Northern League seems to have secured marginal seats.</p> <p> An alliance with the post-fascist National Alliance is expected to win seats in the south.</p> <p> Italian opinion polls tend to have wider margins of error because of the fractured parties and complex electoral system, a hybrid of first past the post and proportional representation.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Italian opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi's media company says it will sue the Economist magazine for saying in yesterday's edition that he is unfit to lead a government. Aides said that the media magnate was stunned that a magazine revered by Italy's business class could launch such an attack a fortnight before the general election in which his centre-right coalition expects to regain power. Yesterday's front cover showed him looking pensive beneath the headline: \"Why Silvio Berlusconi is unfit to lead Italy.\" An editorial and an article analysed his business empire, which includes three television networks, a publishing house, a football team, property, and financial services. It added: \"In any self-respecting democracy it would be unthinkable that the man assumed to be on the verge of being elected prime minister would recently have come under investigation for, among other things, money-laundering, complicity in murder, connections with the mafia, tax evasion and the bribing of politicians, judges and the tax police.'' Mr Berlusconi, 64, who briefly served as prime minister in 1994, has faced numerous trials connected to his holding company Fininvest. A conviction for false accounting was overturned on appeal. Two convictions for bribing tax collectors and illegal payments to politicians were extinguished when the appeals ran out of time under the statute of limitations. Accusations of false accounting, bribing judges, tax fraud and breaking anti-trust laws are being investigated. The Economist also referred to the pending trial in Sicily of Mr Berlusconi's friend Marcello Dell' Ultri, who is accused of links to Cosa Nostra. Investigations into Mr Berlusconi's alleged mafia links were closed without any charges being brought. Fininvest, which controls Mr Berlusconi's media interests, said in a statement faxed to Reuters that the article contained \"a series of old accusations'' which were \"an insult to truth and intelligence''. \"The Economist offers its readers an exact photocopy of the most infamous calumnies aimed at Fininvest and its founder Silvio Berlusconi in recent times. \"The answer to such a serious libellous action must be left to the courts in which the Economist will be obliged to deliver compensation matching the extent of the harm done.\" The statement did not say whether the case would be brought in the Italian or British courts. The Economist declined to comment on the Fininvest statement except to say that it stood by its story. Many of the allegations have been aired before in Italy, but the British magazine claims to have supporting evidence. The cumulative effect of six pages chronicling 40 years of unanswered questions has had an explosive impact in Italy. Mr Berlusconi has always said the accusations were part of a leftwing conspiracy and the Economist, seen as right wing has not until now been counted among his enemies. Its allegations were splashed across several national newspapers and brandished by the ruling centre-left coalition. \"So even the Economist is communist?\" said Arturo Parisi, leader of the Democrats. Mr Berlusconi's aides dismissed the article as more pap from a biased foreign press. Despite the fuss Mr Berlusconi is still expected to win on May 13. The Opinion polls suggested that the government has narrowed but failed to erase the gap in time to stop a remarkable comeback. Mr Berlusconi's coalition would take 47.7% of the vote and the government 43.2% if the election was held immediately, a poll in yesterday's La Stampa found. Today is the last day polls can be published under election laws. The key to the centre-right's advantage is the north, where an alliance with the anti-immigrant Northern League seems to have secured marginal seats. An alliance with the post-fascist National Alliance is expected to win seats in the south. Italian opinion polls tend to have wider margins of error because of the fractured parties and complex electoral system, a hybrid of first past the post and proportional representation.",

Consultants have told Allerdale council, which covers a swath of Lakeland and the surrounding area with the highest number of foot and mouth cases, that on occasions short-term levels of potentially deadly chemicals from one large pyre exceeded national air quality standards.

They say local streams and water supplies will be polluted if the burial goes ahead. While the four-day pollution study at a farm pyre near Caldbeck, in north Cumbria, revealed average concentrations within accepted levels, the company that undertook the research said that a big question mark still remained over the wider atmospheric impact.

      "body": "<p>Labour this week denied that it had changed government policy just because of all the media attention given to one little white calf. The minister responsible insisted that it had always been the government's plan to extend the baby bond scheme to include calves. Newborn cows will receive \u00a3300 in their own junior savers account which will be theirs at 18 to spend on university courses, setting up small businesses or bribing their way out of the abattoir.</p> <p>In terms of the actual foot and mouth cull, government policy is now that the slaughter must only proceed under strict new guidelines which grade animals according to how pretty they are. Calves are pretty so they will now be spared. Sheep and pigs are not that pretty, so they're still for it. Lobsters, toads and stag beetles might as well all just commit suicide now. But if it's suddenly discovered that labrador puppies and koala bears are the worst carriers of foot and mouth then the government is really in trouble.</p> <p>What's amazing about this whole episode is that it has taken the media so long to find a cuddly calf to move us all to tears. We've had a surfeit of farm animal pictures, but somehow the creatures don't look so endearing when they are the wrong way up and on fire. It's not been the sort of animal footage that had you expecting to hear Johnny Morris coming in with a funny voice-over.</p> <p>Of course you would have to be a complete cynic to think this calf's miraculous survival was some sort of set-up. It's just a coincidence that the creature that's risen from the ashes of the slaughter policy is called Phoenix, that she's purest white and was discovered at a time when farmers believed that the culling of healthy cows might possibly be suspended. Suddenly she's all over every front page and the British are besides themselves with emotion. If the same photos of a calf appeared on the other side of the Channel the French would just think `Mmm, delicious!' In Spain, they'd probably say `Let's kill it by getting the fattest man in the village to ride it through the main square!'</p> <p>The whole episode proves once again that the British care more about animals than they do about people. Nothing upsets us more than man's inhumanity to beast. If pensioners have to wait years for a hip operation then we accept it with a defeated shrug, but show some footage of a gannet with a broken wing, and get-well cards will pour in from around the country; police will set up roadblocks to ensure the creature gets to the seabird rescue centre as quickly as possible, where a candle-lit gannet vigil is already under way.</p> <p>In Britain we donate more money to animal charities than we give to children's charities. Last year a new record was set when an old lady left $7m to the National Canine Defence League. I suppose this is better than giving it to a cats' home - at least the dogs might wag their tails a bit and look vaguely grateful; cats would just look at you as if to say `Yeah, \u00a37m? So what?' One animal refuge specialising in hamsters has funds of nearly \u00a310m. What use is \u00a310m to a few hamsters?

      "bodyText": "Labour this week denied that it had changed government policy just because of all the media attention given to one little white calf. The minister responsible insisted that it had always been the government's plan to extend the baby bond scheme to include calves. Newborn cows will receive \u00a3300 in their own junior savers account which will be theirs at 18 to spend on university courses, setting up small businesses or bribing their way out of the abattoir. In terms of the actual foot and mouth cull, government policy is now that the slaughter must only proceed under strict new guidelines which grade animals according to how pretty they are. Calves are pretty so they will now be spared. Sheep and pigs are not that pretty, so they're still for it. Lobsters, toads and stag beetles might as well all just commit suicide now. But if it's suddenly discovered that labrador puppies and koala bears are the worst carriers of foot and mouth then the government is really in trouble. What's amazing about this whole episode is that it has taken the media so long to find a cuddly calf to move us all to tears. We've had a surfeit of farm animal pictures, but somehow the creatures don't look so endearing when they are the wrong way up and on fire. It's not been the sort of animal footage that had you expecting to hear Johnny Morris coming in with a funny voice-over. Of course you would have to be a complete cynic to think this calf's miraculous survival was some sort of set-up. It's just a coincidence that the creature that's risen from the ashes of the slaughter policy is called Phoenix, that she's purest white and was discovered at a time when farmers believed that the culling of healthy cows might possibly be suspended. Suddenly she's all over every front page and the British are besides themselves with emotion. If the same photos of a calf appeared on the other side of the Channel the French would just think `Mmm, delicious!' In Spain, they'd probably say `Let's kill it by getting the fattest man in the village to ride it through the main square!' The whole episode proves once again that the British care more about animals than they do about people. Nothing upsets us more than man's inhumanity to beast. If pensioners have to wait years for a hip operation then we accept it with a defeated shrug, but show some footage of a gannet with a broken wing, and get-well cards will pour in from around the country; police will set up roadblocks to ensure the creature gets to the seabird rescue centre as quickly as possible, where a candle-lit gannet vigil is already under way. In Britain we donate more money to animal charities than we give to children's charities. Last year a new record was set when an old lady left $7m to the National Canine Defence League. I suppose this is better than giving it to a cats' home - at least the dogs might wag their tails a bit and look vaguely grateful; cats would just look at you as if to say `Yeah, \u00a37m? So what?' One animal refuge specialising in hamsters has funds of nearly \u00a310m. What use is \u00a310m to a few hamsters? You could shred the banknotes for their bedding, I suppose, and maybe employ some domestic staff to spin the little wheel for them at weekends. A rest home for horses in Buckinghamshire has a stockmarket portfolio of \u00a314m, which is more than the combined funds of Unicef UK, Shelter and Care International UK. Either these retired horses are geniuses at investing on the stock market, or someone has been giving them more than they really need. But just as animals win the beauty contest of deserving causes, so our news agenda is set by emotional rather than rational criteria. Thousands of steel workers have lost their jobs during the foot and mouth crisis; mass redundancies were announced in West Lothian this week, but these workers have already been forgotten because they made the mistake of not being wide-eyed cuddly animals. In the meantime Phoenix herself continues to enjoy the overnight celebrity status that only the tabloids can bestow. Tonight she's going to a film premier with Angus Deayton; OK! Magazine are currently doing a photo shoot of Phoenix relaxing in her barn and she's already being tipped as the next host of Gladiators. But of course the tabloids that currently love little Phoenix won't be so kind to her forever. They are building her up to knock her down... soon it will be `Phoenix denies udder implants'; `Moo-er! Fatty Phoenix has turned into an old cow!' and the rather harder to believe `Drug crazed Phoenix in pub brawl with EastEnders star'.

      "body": "<p>A big bang decennial census is not strictly necessary. Other countries do well enough in utilising the mass of information about households collected in the normal course of tax gathering, schooling, health and town hall registration. Some worry about government transferring personal data across the firewalls which keep the state's various banks apart. But e-technology both makes this easier and helps anonymise personal data. When asked about alternative kinds of census in a Cabinet Office review a little while ago, the information commissioner was relaxed. It is a fair bet that the census to be taken tomorrow will be the last of its kind.</p> <p>Maybe the fact that national statistics will soon review the census's future gives all the more reason to celebrate the richness of social knowledge gleaned from this survey. This year's form gives households a chance to identify themselves in terms of their ethnic (and UK-national) provenance... though not including a Welsh identifier was stupid. It opens up the domestic economy to provide insight into who does the looking after when relatives are dependent. To combat the know-nothings who seem to find society's self-knowledge frightening, national statistics has perhaps exaggerated the significance of a mere head count. Of course grants and health planning depend on it. This census will be especially pertinent in charting neighbourhoods and local communities: detailed knowledge of who lives where is a precondition of targeting money for regeneration and renewal.

      "bodyText": "A big bang decennial census is not strictly necessary. Other countries do well enough in utilising the mass of information about households collected in the normal course of tax gathering, schooling, health and town hall registration. Some worry about government transferring personal data across the firewalls which keep the state's various banks apart. But e-technology both makes this easier and helps anonymise personal data. When asked about alternative kinds of census in a Cabinet Office review a little while ago, the information commissioner was relaxed. It is a fair bet that the census to be taken tomorrow will be the last of its kind. Maybe the fact that national statistics will soon review the census's future gives all the more reason to celebrate the richness of social knowledge gleaned from this survey. This year's form gives households a chance to identify themselves in terms of their ethnic (and UK-national) provenance... though not including a Welsh identifier was stupid. It opens up the domestic economy to provide insight into who does the looking after when relatives are dependent. To combat the know-nothings who seem to find society's self-knowledge frightening, national statistics has perhaps exaggerated the significance of a mere head count. Of course grants and health planning depend on it. This census will be especially pertinent in charting neighbourhoods and local communities: detailed knowledge of who lives where is a precondition of targeting money for regeneration and renewal. In order to care about neighbours... or at least to use taxes, benefits and grants to try to help the disadvantaged... means, first of all, knowing where they live. Though the census does not directly record people's incomes and once-in-a-decade enumerations rapidly date, it should fill in the social map and so add to mutual understanding in a fissiparous society. For that reason Sunday's form should be filled in with pride.",

The driver of the Jaguar, a 32-year-old man, was seriously injured and was last night under police guard in Huddersfield royal infirmary. Ms Coghlan, who leaves a teenage son, Robin, was killed after a chain of events that began when a man apparently armed with a handgun raided a chemist in Birkby, near Huddersfield.

The animal charity has accused Richard Meade, who won three Olympic medals in 1968 and 1972, of spearheading a campaign to encourage 600 hunt supporters to join the society to overturn the society's long-standing opposition to bloodsports. Mr Meade faces possible expulsion by the RSPCA, which is planning to look at legal options to force him to leave the society at a future meeting of its ruling council. His group, the Countryside Animal Welfare Group, set up five years ago, consists of 5,000 RSPCA members who want to make the charity support fox hunting. The internal accounts of the Countryside Alliance, seen by the Guardian, show that in 1999, it gave Cawg at least \u00a313,490 to fund a mailshot and the `fees and expenses'' of Mr Meade. The alliance admitted that this was part of a larger sum over a longer period but declined to disclose the full amount that had been given to the showjumper.

But after the signing of the Good Friday agreement the men, who grew up in Northern Ireland, claim they were suddenly cut adrift from the army. They have described being unable to contact their handlers or seek the protection which, they say, was promised to them when they agreed to act as double-agents. Ten soldiers who say they were sent back to their home communities in the early 1980s to infiltrate the republican movement have begun to lobby the Ministry of Defence, fearing that without help they will be hunted down and assassinated by republicans. They want the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, to recognise what they did at the behest of the security forces and have them 'brought in from the cold'. Specifically, the men, who regard themselves as soldiers even though they were discharged from the military, want to be given new identities and relocated. They also want an army pension. The MoD has so far refused to accept the existence of the double agents. Sensitivity on the subject, however, is high. The ministry has repeatedly tried to thwart reporting of details of intelligence operations in Northern Ireland, especially since the Metropolitan police launched a third inquiry into long-standing claims that the army and RUC special branch colluded with terrorists. Earlier this week the MoD won a high court order stopping Ulster Television from broadcasting a documentary in which one of the alleged double agents gave a detailed account of how he informed on the IRA for more than 10 years. UTV is contesting the injunction. One of the double-agents has told the Guardian that another, a 40-year-old, claimed that his army handlers knew he had helped to murder members of the security forces and had been responsible for making a bomb which was fired at an RUC patrol in Newry, Co Down, on March 27 1992, killing a female officer, Colleen McMurray. Her colleague, Constable Paul Slaine, who lost both legs in the attack, received the George Cross from the Queen on behalf of the RUC at Hillsborough Castle in April 2000. Another former soldier involved in the campaign told the Guardian that he and the other double agents were recruited from the Ist and 2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Rangers and the Queens Royal Irish Hussars, between 1979 and 1984. The soldiers, then aged 18 and 19, were approached individually at an early stage in their careers - one after just a few weeks service - by members of the army's intelligence corps.

And sometimes, as he did this week, he goes on the Today programme and thwacks the object of his ire to one side as though he is irritated even to have it mentioned.</p> <p> The problem this week was the intervention of the European commission in his area of responsibility, the British economy.</p> <p> Mr Brown told Brussels not to interfere in British economic policy after the commission ordered him to put a cap on public spending, reported the Daily Telegraph, going on to talk of the government's outrage at the supposed intervention.</p> <p> It was seen by Mr Brown as a deliberate attempt to meddle in domestic affairs, in particular tax and spending decisions, even though Britain is not a member of the single currency. The Financial Times said the government \"had reacted angrily\".</p> <p> In his radio interview Mr Brown adopted the \"I am not going to be told by Brussels...\" tone so welcome to Euro-sceptic ears. It's all about tone, and the noise that the chancellor consistently puts across is to speak out when Europe goes over the line and to remain silent, as he has over the euro, at other times. Were you simply to collect what he has said, as opposed to collecting his volume of silences, you could easily draw the conclusion that Gordon is a Eurosceptic.</p> <p> That presumably is the point, and is what the committed Europeans, including the prime minister, find so irritating. Mr Brown smiles and keeps his counsel, as he does in so many matters controversial or difficult for the government. As Donald Macintyre said in his Independent column this week: \"There are times when it almost looks as if these problems [Kosovo, fuel prices, foot and mouth] belong to a different government from the one Mr Brown is involved in running.\" And that, said Macintyre, could have consequences after the election.</p> <p> A looming problem is the question of how far Mr Brown will seek to keep the assessment of the famous EMU tests (the euro entry criteria) closeted within the Treasury. But the euro is not something Mr Brown mentions. Not so the Sun. As the non-election campaign gathers momentum, Labour's other red-top declared supporter (the Mirror is always there) misses no opportunity to remind the government, more than its readers, that it may be voting Labour but it is certainly not voting euro. In a leader headed On a Loser, the Sun declared that the message about the euro finally seemed to be getting through.'It appears the government realises it can't win a referendum on scrapping the pound during its second term of office. We like the sound of this, Tony. If you can't do it before 2006, why do it at all?' The Sun regularly drips in little paragraphs of little consequence quoting people of little influence, running stories which do not appear elsewhere. So this week we had \"French face euro chaos\", which amounted to some quotes from former French interior minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, warning that the new euro notes and coins would confuse shoppers and deter them from buying anything.</p> <p> If Britain's 12m or so tabloid readers are not offered a choice of which party to vote for in the election, they are certainly given one in terms of attitude to Europe. Consistently the Mirror is doing the government's work for it, championing Europe when ministers think it safer to keep quiet.</p> <p> Europe is strongest link for UK, read the headline on a Mirror leader this week. Praising the chancellor for his stewardship of the economy, and pointing out the widening trade gap with the American and Asian economies, the paper said: \"But trade with our European partners has been doing all right. Which just shows what nonsense is talked by the anti-Europeans.</p> <p> \"For long term prosperity and security there must be long term vision. That means keeping a tight rein on public finances, spending only what the nation can afford and strengthening our links with Europe.\" Gordon Brown would certainly agree with the first half of that last sentence.</p> <p> Peter Cole is professor of journalism at Sheffield University.</p>",

As Donald Macintyre said in his Independent column this week: \"There are times when it almost looks as if these problems [Kosovo, fuel prices, foot and mouth] belong to a different government from the one Mr Brown is involved in running.\" And that, said Macintyre, could have consequences after the election. A looming problem is the question of how far Mr Brown will seek to keep the assessment of the famous EMU tests (the euro entry criteria) closeted within the Treasury. But the euro is not something Mr Brown mentions. Not so the Sun. As the non-election campaign gathers momentum, Labour's other red-top declared supporter (the Mirror is always there) misses no opportunity to remind the government, more than its readers, that it may be voting Labour but it is certainly not voting euro. In a leader headed On a Loser, the Sun declared that the message about the euro finally seemed to be getting through.'It appears the government realises it can't win a referendum on scrapping the pound during its second term of office. We like the sound of this, Tony. If you can't do it before 2006, why do it at all?' The Sun regularly drips in little paragraphs of little consequence quoting people of little influence, running stories which do not appear elsewhere. So this week we had \"French face euro chaos\", which amounted to some quotes from former French interior minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, warning that the new euro notes and coins would confuse shoppers and deter them from buying anything. If Britain's 12m or so tabloid readers are not offered a choice of which party to vote for in the election, they are certainly given one in terms of attitude to Europe. Consistently the Mirror is doing the government's work for it, championing Europe when ministers think it safer to keep quiet. Europe is strongest link for UK, read the headline on a Mirror leader this week. Praising the chancellor for his stewardship of the economy, and pointing out the widening trade gap with the American and Asian economies, the paper said: \"But trade with our European partners has been doing all right. Which just shows what nonsense is talked by the anti-Europeans. \"For long term prosperity and security there must be long term vision. That means keeping a tight rein on public finances, spending only what the nation can afford and strengthening our links with Europe.\" Gordon Brown would certainly agree with the first half of that last sentence.

      "body": "<p>This was always the dislike that dare not speak its name. If, as a city dweller, you professed an antipathy to the countryside, said that you don't much like it out there, don't particularly want to visit and certainly don't ever want to live in it, you were deemed some kind of crackpot, a disturbed and probably unpatriotic pariah. I was once pilloried on the public stocks of the Terry Wogan show for saying just that. Ridiculed for suggesting that it might be more rewarding to reside in London, Manchester or Glasgow than in some twee village where a tractor show is high culture and Asda is a shopping experience. Diss the cities and the millions who live in them, however, and you'll be lauded for talking obvious commonsense. During a phone-in on Radio 5, some charming chap from the West Country insisted that I must be \"educationally subnormal\" because I preferred the challenges and chances proffered by a big, noisy, dirty, city.</p> <p>Yet this was the first country to turn its back on country life in favour of mass industrialisation and urbanisation, and is now the nation with one of the lowest percentages of its people working the soil, the most intensively mechanised farming practices, the least well-preserved rural culture and the most cosmopolitan metropolitan one. But we don't acknowledge all that, instead indulging in a bizarre form of collective self-loathing. We're urban and suburban souls in denial and Barbours. We have such a romantic, roses-round-the-door-tinted perception of our supposedly green and pleasant land, of warm beer and long shadows, of John Bull's stout and hearty yeomen, that \"city bad, country good\" is the almost universally accepted wisdom.</p> <p>In fact, so keen are we on owning a little piece of the sacred soil that we even buy up vast tracts of rural France. Around 400,000 British people have bought homes in the Dordogne, Normandy and Provence, amazed that the French want to sell their ruined out-houses and draughty barns to the old enemy. But, as Paul Rambali, an Anglo-French writer who lives in Paris, points out, \"The French don't want to live out there in the wasteland, that's for peasants and pigs as far as they're concerned.\" Like most Europeans, in fact like most everybody else, the French are resolutely urban. By 2020, the World Resource Report suggests, 75% of the world's population will live in cities.</p> <p>The British, however, against all logic and evidence, still believe they're a nation of jolly gentlemen farmers. Professor Maxwell Hutchinson, former president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, is convinced that this warped and uniquely British idea has damaged both town and countryside: \"It was a reaction against the genuine squalor of Victorian cities, and a soppy watercolour idealisation of the countryside which is simply not substantiated by reality. It means that our priorities are skewed, cities are denigrated and rural areas are overpopulated. I fell for it and tried the country house bit, but came back to live in London, which I have to say I much prefer. The city is man's greatest invention.\" Most British men and women, however, would not agree with that, cherishing some Good Life fantasy image of Albion.</p> <p>But today, as military snipers stalk the charred and diseased fields, all that might finally be changing. The Wellington boot is finally on the other foot. Suddenly, the countryside is a dangerous place, out of bounds and out of favour, synonymous with contagion and corruption, dark practices, huge subsidies and red-faced men in dubious alliances bleating like the sheep they fed to cows and blaming everybody but themselves when people got sick. Foot and mouth hasn't led to a massive wave of support for the poor sons of the soil among the urban masses, but it may well have brought about a sea change in our attitude to rural Britain.</p> <p>People in towns are saying enough is enough. We've given you one job to do, huge subsidies to do it, and you've given us mad cow disease, E. coli, salmonella and now this. There's a sense here in the dark satanic cities that what's happening out there is a clear case of \"as you sow, so shall you reap\". Which farmers, of all people, really ought to understand. (I would add something about chickens coming home to roost, if they weren't all crammed into batteries so small that they can't possibly go anywhere.)</p> <p>I'm sure that many agricultural souls are genuinely suffering, but for years too many cried wolf while hunting foxes, driving Range Rovers and sending their kids to private schools on the proceeds of turning fields into featureless factories. But do you ever hear a single one of them say sorry, we were wrong?</p> <p>No, instead they blame foreigners, the EU, the government or city types \"demanding cheap food\". How many times have we heard that ludicrous mantra in this current crisis? I don't recall going on the cheap chop demonstrations of the 90s or marching to Trafalgar Square insisting that our food producers save us a few pennies by cannibalising herbivores. Surely the huge swing towards organic produce among us townies, the queues at overpriced health-food shops, the fetish for free-range, corn-fed, extra-virgin, born-free, lived-wild-and-hopefully-died-naturally food is a sign that we're demanding anything but the chemically-saturated, factory-farmed, lowest- common-denominator produce that farmers have foisted upon us. But do they listen?</p> <p>A photographer friend, sent to Devon to cover foot and mouth for his paper, said to me, when he came back, \"The arrogance of those people was amazing. All they did was blame me as a representative of the media.\" Certainly, the farmers who've had any contact with newspapers or television during recent crises haven't done themselves too many favours. Few seem prepared to accept that there could be anything intrinsically wrong with the way they go about managing the countryside, and producing our foodstuffs, and that perhaps it has to change. Most seem intent on whingeing until they get yet more hand-outs to preserve the putrid status quo. But these were not people noted for their support of miners, steelworkers or printers when their industries were being decimated by the Margaret Thatcher they all voted for. Farmers will happily hold the country to ransom over the tax on petrol they don't even have to pay, and then hold us responsible when things go horribly wrong. The man whose pig-processing plant first succumbed to foot and mouth blamed it not on allegedly dubious hygiene practices, but on someone eating foreign meat in a sandwich and throwing it on the ground. That's not exactly grace under pressure.</p> <p>Now is a time for us ignorant townies to apply pressure to rethink the way we allow farmers to go about their business. And perhaps we will also start to reassess our views of what life is really like out there. Countryfolk have always said that we don't understand them; well, perhaps, we are finally beginning to, and it doesn't look particularly pretty. But then, to me, it never has. Apart from the sensory deprivation of nothing to do, whenever I've ventured into the rural wonderland. I always seem to land up in some small-minded little England. A bad-taste, intolerant, prying land that time forgot, where everybody looks and thinks and dresses and moans and eats the same. How come, whenever you dine in one of our famed country pubs, everything is served in a basket and comes complete with frozen chips and sachets of ketchup or ersatz Thai spices? In rural Italy, France or Spain, you really can find great fresh, indigenous, truly local peasant cuisine in the most humble surroundings, whereas here you get served the same bland, uniform, processed rubbish. While the posh restaurant will inevitably be a bastion of snotty pretension with dress codes and French menus. If the countryside is where food comes from, how come they don't know how to cook and serve it?</p> <p>Jonathan Meades, a leading food writer, puts it like this: \"We lost our national cuisine after the war when we chose to go down the path of industrial farming, basically an animal feed business, the biggest amount of the least choice. And that is absolutely reflected in the standard of food, which is appalling. It's all cooking by numbers and pre-prepared boil-in-a-bag exoticism. We have to be honest with ourselves: most of the British countryside is breeze-block bungalows and light industrial estates with cuisine to match. It's no better now than it was when I was growing up there and desperate to leave.\"</p> <p>Yet we're force-fed the idea that the countryside is the ideal place for kids. And typically, this faintly soppy predilection for watching sprogs gambol in fields like so many lambs has been turned into an anti-urban prejudice, suggesting that it's akin to child abuse to allow young ones to be brought up in big towns. As a result, I've known otherwise sane urban couples anguish about giving up the metropolitan existence they so enjoy to do the right thing by their little ones. Country Life, a bizarrely British title if ever there was one, recently ran a shock-horror survey suggesting that civilisation was about end because deprived inner-city kids didn't know that milk came from cows or that cows came from Gloucestershire, or some such insulting nonsense. Well, if they watch the news, they'll know that British cows can't go anywhere right now.</p> <p>My three (well, more the older two - Maude has a good excuse, being only 20 months) are fairly aware that the organic milk left on our doorstep every day began life as bovine baby juice, and they also know a few other things. Among them the contents of the British Museum and Tate Modern, the Portuguese for \"please\" and \"thank you\" (the bloke in the corner shop is Portuguese), the menu at our local Japanese restaurant, the date of Diwali, the capital of Eritrea (the babysitter's Eritrean), most of the words to Pretty Vacant, the underlying reasons for the Balkan crises (the neighbour's Kosovan), the layout of Lord's cricket ground, Loftus Road and the Tricycle Theatre, and how best to get a couple of bob out of Grandma Ying if she's had a win at mah jong (Grandma's Chinese). If you really think rural life - with its limited horizons, few diversions and endless hours hanging out at the bus stop drinking cider - is better for kids, then try asking some of them. The minute they get anywhere near old enough to have minds of their own, they want to get on the first bus to the dreaded city.</p> <p>When I occasionally take my family in the other direction, that's when I really notice one of the major differences. A rumbustious bunch of mixed-raced kids with an Anglo-Chinese mum and a ginger dad don't cause much of a stir in London NW1. But the stares and the whispered comments the minute we arrive in Straw Dogs territory are immediately noticeable. When I said this on Radio 4 recently, Miles Kington wrote a supposedly funny column in the Independent saying that my family get stared at in the country not because of our racial make up, but because the locals might think we're burglars or Jehovah's Witnesses. I don't know how funny Mr Kington would find it if his wife and children were racially insulted in the street. It's only ever happened twice, both times in small English market towns by respectable middle-aged women of the shires.</p> <p>It isn't only my family who get that sort of treatment. I've known numerous black friends who simply refuse to leave their cities. For them, it's too much like travelling back in time, to that sorry England where a racist joke served up in the pub along with your pewter tankard is just a bit of fun, where strange \"outsiders\" are still a source of amusement or fear. Claire Gorham, an Anglo-African TV presenter living in London, puts it like this: \"I feel very uncomfortable in the country because the atmosphere and the attitude is very different. Suddenly, you're made aware again that your race is an issue. It isn't always hostile, but occasionally it can be.\"</p> <p>Certainly, the fact that everybody looks the same because everybody is pretty much the same is one of the reasons why I find the countryside dreary and rather depressing. But I also fear that it's one of the reasons some people are attracted to it. Those who sing the praises of rural over urban life always point out that there is an annual exodus from cities to towns, as if all those people upping sticks to move to the sticks can't be wrong. Well, some of those people may well be moving for what I would definitely consider to be the wrong reasons. They used to call it \"white flight\" in the US during the 70s and 80s, when cities such as Detroit and Chicago were being stripped of their affluent, Caucasian middle classes, who were fleeing to gated communities in the deep suburbs. A retreat into the uniform monoculture of old England because of an inability to accept the challenges and pleasures of genuinely multicultural cities, is, I'm sure, one of the reasons why some people choose to relocate in the laager of the shires.</p> <p>But perhaps now that the harsh and sometimes ugly realities of true rural life are being shown on our television screens every day, our preposterous romanticism of all things green and supposedly bucolic will end. And the attendant defamation of all things urban will give way to a more realistic and balanced attitude. Perhaps, also, we will finally see a change in the priorities and practices of those who manage our agriculture, better to reflect the true demands of the urban population who crave more varied, more healthy, more natural food.</p> <p>It's hard to imagine anything good coming out of all this disease and destruction, but, if it does, then maybe even I could learn to love the countryside just a little.</p>",

America's growth rate doubled to an annualised 2% in the first three months of the year after the bursting of the hi-tech bubble and sharp downturn in spending last year. The surprise momentum, led by increased consumer demand, meant the US completed a record 10th year of unbroken expansion. There was less good news from Britain where GDP expanded at 0.3% in the first quarter, with the weakness of industrial production acting as a brake on the economy. Although the annual rate of growth fell only slightly, by 0.1 percentage points, the slowdown raised speculation that the Bank of England would cut interest rates next week for the third time this year. Foot and mouth disease had little impact on the economy in the first quarter but is expected to depress agriculture and tourism in the second. Paul O'Neill, the US treasury secretary, described the 2% growth rate as 'nothing but good news'. In contrast Horst K\u00f6hler, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned against being overly optimistic. 'The world economy is going through a very difficult phase.

It is also anxiously monitoring the situation in Argentina, suffering from a debt-induced crisis. As the multilateral institutions grapple with such problems in the developing world during their annual spring meetings this weekend, Wim Duisenberg, the president of European Central Bank, is expected to come under heavy pressure today to cut euroland interest rates. Several leading economists and politicians have criticised the ECB in the past few days for its reluctance to ease policy.

      "bodyText": "The new Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, was given no honeymoon period yesterday as sobering economy data underscored the challenges he faces in rebuilding the world's second biggest economy. Worse than expected statistics on consumption and earnings heightened concerns about deflation, while a sharp fall in industrial production suggested Japan could be lurching back towards recession. The premier may also have to find a new governor of the Bank of Japan, after reports that Masaru Hayami is about to resign, citing 'ill health' as the reason. Yesterday's dismal economic figures seemed in line with an IMF forecast that Japan's growth would slow to a meagre 0.6% this fiscal year compared to 1.7% last year. Even that modest prediction may prove too optimistic if Mr Koizumi pushes through the painful reforms that he considers necessary to restore Japan to health after 10 years of stagnation. The prime minister, who inaugurated his cabinet on Thursday, has made reform of the banking system his priority even if it means two years of recession, unemployment and bankruptcy. Yesterday's data gave ammunition to his opponents, who say that the economy is too weak for such surgery. Consumer prices slipped by a record 0.5% in the year to March 31 as sluggish demand and deregulation forced down prices for everything from hamburgers to clothing. With unemployment hovering close to a record 4.7% and expected to rise, wage earners cut back their spending by 0.4% last year to save more for an uncertain future. Incomes also slipped for the fourth month in a row fuelling fears that Japan may be on the edge of a deflationary spiral. 'There is a very persistent downward move in prices,' said Heizo Takenaka, the new economics minister. 'We need to determine how much of the decline is due to lack of demand.'

      "body": "<p>George Bush had an uncompromising message for the Washington cynics who claim that he is nothing more than Dick Cheney's front man. 'To these people, I say this,' the president began a speech last month. Then he looked at the man sitting further down the table and asked: `Well, Dick, what do I say?'</p> <p>Self-deprecating humour is one of the favourite weapons of America's new president, who completes his first hundred days in office tomorrow. But the jokes cannot entirely conceal the truth. Mr Bush may have got the office and the title, but time and again it is Mr Cheney who does the work, who calls the shots and who sets the administration on its conservative course.</p> <p>Having picked many members of the administration in December and January, he has now surrounded himself with a heavyweight staff of his own, installed himself at all the vital junctions of decision-making in the White House, and taken charge of key policy areas, including the federal budget and the energy policy review.</p> <p>No important meeting on foreign policy takes place without his being present, and he is the administration's principal ambassador to Capitol Hill, where as vice-president he holds the casting vote in the evenly divided Senate. It is an unprecedented workload for a US vice-president, let alone one who has had four heart attacks and quadruple bypass surgery.</p> <p>The job has come a long way since Vice-President John Nance Garner in the 1930s said it was 'not worth a bucket of warm spit'. It is a mark of Mr Cheney's importance that he has four separate Washington offices: one in the Senate, another in the House of Representatives, a third in the Old Executive Office Building, where most of his staff work, and one in the west wing of the White House, just down the corridor from the Oval Office.</p> <p>None of this is obvious from the outside. Mr Bush's daily schedule is full of activities which keep him constantly in the public eye. Mr Cheney, by contrast, has few public engagements, makes virtually no speeches, gives only rare interviews (including one to Larry King last night), and keeps out of the limelight, 'never showing more surface than necessary' as the secretary of state, Colin Powell, describes it in his 1995 memoirs.</p> <p>And this secret revolution has stunned friend and foe alike.

      "bodyText": "George Bush had an uncompromising message for the Washington cynics who claim that he is nothing more than Dick Cheney's front man. 'To these people, I say this,' the president began a speech last month. Then he looked at the man sitting further down the table and asked: `Well, Dick, what do I say?' Self-deprecating humour is one of the favourite weapons of America's new president, who completes his first hundred days in office tomorrow. But the jokes cannot entirely conceal the truth. Mr Bush may have got the office and the title, but time and again it is Mr Cheney who does the work, who calls the shots and who sets the administration on its conservative course. Having picked many members of the administration in December and January, he has now surrounded himself with a heavyweight staff of his own, installed himself at all the vital junctions of decision-making in the White House, and taken charge of key policy areas, including the federal budget and the energy policy review. No important meeting on foreign policy takes place without his being present, and he is the administration's principal ambassador to Capitol Hill, where as vice-president he holds the casting vote in the evenly divided Senate. It is an unprecedented workload for a US vice-president, let alone one who has had four heart attacks and quadruple bypass surgery. The job has come a long way since Vice-President John Nance Garner in the 1930s said it was 'not worth a bucket of warm spit'. It is a mark of Mr Cheney's importance that he has four separate Washington offices: one in the Senate, another in the House of Representatives, a third in the Old Executive Office Building, where most of his staff work, and one in the west wing of the White House, just down the corridor from the Oval Office. None of this is obvious from the outside. Mr Bush's daily schedule is full of activities which keep him constantly in the public eye. Mr Cheney, by contrast, has few public engagements, makes virtually no speeches, gives only rare interviews (including one to Larry King last night), and keeps out of the limelight, 'never showing more surface than necessary' as the secretary of state, Colin Powell, describes it in his 1995 memoirs. And this secret revolution has stunned friend and foe alike. Ronald Reagan's former chief of staff Ken Duberstein says it is 'the first time in our history we've had a president and a prime minister'. The Democratic congressman Robert Wexler just says: 'Dick Cheney is running the government'. 'To compare him to other vice-presidents is to diminish his real influence,' says Paul Light, the author of a book on the vice-presidency. 'He's really a chief of staff, the senior cabinet secretary, the chairman of the kitchen cabinet, the president's best friend and mentor, all rolled into one.' No one ever doubted that Mr Cheney would be a huge asset to the inexperienced Mr Bush. His time as Gerald Ford's chief of staff and George Bush Sr's defence secretary, plus his 10 years as an influential Republican congressman in the 1980s and his experience as chief executive of the Halliburton oil company from 1995, gave him an exceptional background. It also helped that he had given up any thought of running for the presidency himself. In the past 50 years Spiro Agnew was the only elected vice-president who did not have a shot at the top job. 'You can play a very different role if you aren't running for president,' Mr Cheney's longstanding colleague Bob Teeter says. 'It means the president can entrust you with big things'. The first proof of Mr Cheney's true importance came when Mr Bush sublet the entire presidential transition process to him in December. Mr Cheney's hand was soon seen in cabinet nominations, such as his old patron Donald Rumsfeld for defence secretary and his old colleague Paul O'Neill at the treasury. Even so, few people would have been able to predict how central Mr Cheney has already become on policy issues. 'He's a lot stronger today than anybody anticipated when Bush picked him,' the Republican lobbyist Chuck Greener says. For instance, no previous vice-president had such power over the government budget. Mr Cheney chaired the budget review board this spring, settling spending disputes between departments without ever referring them to Mr Bush. No previous vice-president has had such a central role in national security policy either. Mr Cheney attends every 'principals' meeting' of the national security council and is one of the inner group, along with Mr Bush, the national security adviser Condoleezza Rice and the White House chief of staff Andy Card, which takes the final political decisions. And while Mr Cheney gets every security briefing that goes to his colleagues, he has also installed his own private national security team, headed by his chief of staff Lewis 'Scooter' Libby, which briefs him alone. Mr Cheney was the key proponent of the two big policy reviews set in motion as soon as the administration took office. The first, on US defence needs, was entrusted to Mr Rumsfeld. The second, on US energy strategy, he has taken charge of himself. When it is published in a few weeks time, the energy review may prove to be the defining document of the Bush years. It aims to establish policy on everything from nuclear power to oil drilling in protected lands and the future of international oil sanctions. It will set the stage for crucial battles between the energy industry and environmentalists. It will recommend drilling in Alaska, a project Mr Cheney championed as a congressman 20 years ago, exploratory drilling to be allowed in more than 7.6m hectares (17m acres) of the Rocky Mountains, including the Lewis and Clark national forest in Montana, and an easing of air pollution controls. It will raise the possibility of lifting US sanctions against Iran, Libya and possibly even Iraq. It will call on America to build dozens of power plants and reinvest in nuclear power. It will be a bonanza for an industry which gave more than $25m to the Republicans for last year's elections. Everything about the energy review is classic Cheney. Like the president, Mr Cheney is an oil industry man. Before returning to politics he was chief executive of Halliburton, the biggest oil service company in the world, which itself has given $1.5m to the Republican party in the past10 years. Wherever there is oil - Iraq, China, Alaska - Halliburton has interests. Every decision that Mr Cheney's team takes about access to new energy supplies will have a bearing on the company, which provided him with an income of $36.1m last year alone. Mastermind But Mr Cheney is more than just the architect of the administration and the mastermind of its policy direction. He is a fixture at the Senate Republican caucus's weekly strategy meetings, and when arms need to be twisted in the Senate and the House, he is the administration's chief negotiator and dealer. 'Any time there's a strategy session on scheduling and lobbying, he is in the middle of all that,' says Mike Frank of the conservative Heritage Foundation. 'He is a really key player at a substantive level, and not just because of the title he holds.' Conservatives are now preparing for him to play this role in what many see as the greatest battles of the next two years: the right wing's attempt to place its supporters in hundreds of judicial positions at all levels of the federal court system and, above all, to take firm control of the supreme court. Or at least he will if his health holds out. Just over 10 years ago his wife Lynne wrote a novel called Body Politic, in which a 59-year-old vice-president dies of a heart attack while in bed with a television anchorwoman. Today, the health of the 60-year-old Mr Cheney's heart is a constant concern at every level of government. Mr Bush, meanwhile, sticks to the jokes. 'Here are some of the headlines I'd like to see in the future,' he told the American Society of Newspaper Editors on April 5. 'Cheney cloned: president has nothing to do at all now.'

Sebastian Bull, acting finance director, was promoted this week to business development director to drive the strategy through and work with outsiders such as Bechtel to enhance the network. The proposals were greeted with reticence by investors after John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, insisted the company appoint a non-executive director to 'provide a powerful public and consumer interest voice'. While Lord Macdonald's remarks marked a softer tone and proved a fillip to Railtrack's share price, his speech underlined how politically sensitive the network operator was. 'Railtrack is the ultimate political stock,' a spokesman for the company said.",

The animal charity has accused Richard Meade, who won three Olympic medals in 1968 and 1972, of spearheading a campaign to encourage 600 hunt supporters to join the society to overturn the society's long-standing opposition to bloodsports. Mr Meade faces possible expulsion by the RSPCA, which is planning to look at legal options to force him to leave the society at a future meeting of its ruling council. His group, the Countryside Animal Welfare Group, set up five years ago, consists of 5,000 RSPCA members who want to make the charity support fox hunting. The internal accounts of the Countryside Alliance, seen by the Guardian, show that in 1999, it gave Cawg at least \u00a313,490 to fund a mailshot and the \"fees and expenses'' of Mr Meade.

This is in addition to 25,000 job cuts announced last year and will save the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group 395m euros (\u00a3237m) in 2001 and 830m euros by 2003. 'With the purchase of Bestfoods last year there is obviously going to be overlap, given the size of the two companies, and shortly after the purchase we said we would be able to make synergies,' a company spokesman said. Unilever will decide where the jobs will be lost by the third quarter of this year, but posts will go at both Unilever and Bestfoods, the maker of Hellmann's mayonnaise. The cuts are on top of plans to shed 25,000 employees and 100 factories worldwide over the next four years, in a 'path to growth' strategy. Restructuring and disposals will allow the company to concentrate on 400 leading brands out of the original 1,600. The news came as Unilever unveiled first quarter results ahead of forecasts, bolstered by such products as Dove Soap, Magnum ice-cream and Close-up toothpaste. Unilever said a 38% fall in profits to 628m euros was caused by reorganisation costs and increased interest charges.

      "bodyText": "Luc Vandevelde, chairman of troubled Marks &amp; Spencer, yesterday caved in to pressure and waived his entitlement to an \u00a3816,000 bonus payout. Mr Vandevelde has been under attack from unions and shareholders since it emerged last month that he was still in line for the bonus - despite the continuing plunge in M&amp;S sales and profits. The payout is also known to have been causing serious dissent at the highest executive levels within the store group, as all other staff and directors' bonuses have been scrapped. A spokeswoman for Marks &amp; Spencer insisted it had been Mr Vandevelde's decision to waive the bonus, which the GMB union had described as 'obscene' and 'a slap in the face to British workers'. She said the chairman had asked for a meeting of the company's remuneration committee, which ratifies directors' pay packages, to be brought forward to put an end to the mounting controversy. They met on Thursday and hammered out a new deal. Dame Stella Rimington, the former head of MI5 who is a non-executive director of M&amp;S and chairman of the remuneration committee, described Mr Vandevelde's move as 'a very significant gesture'. She said the chairman had no obligation to give up his bonus and that his decision to do so had demonstrated 'real leadership'. Under the old pay deal Mr Vandevelde was in line for a \u00a3704,000 bonus, half in shares and half in cash, payable next month. He was then in line for a futher \u00a3112,000 in five years.

However, he is certain to have been persuaded by mounting pressure from shareholders. Quiz? Could you be a chairman? Related articles",

The Chinese have replaced him with their own Panchen Lama.</p> <p>Since his escape, the Karmapa has been a virtual prisoner in Gyuto monastery near Dharamsala, the hill station in northern India where the Dalai Lama has his residence. The Karmapa yesterday said he now wanted to travel outside India. He had no plans to return to Tibet, unless the Dalai Lama was allowed to accompany him. `I will only go back with His Holiness,' he declared.</p> <p>He said the decision to leave Tsurphu monastery, 30 miles from Lhasa, was entirely his own.</p> <p>At 10.30pm on the night of the escape, December 28, 1999, he slowly climbed down from his room and jumped on to the roof of a nearby shrine room.

By taking back roads through the hills and valleys, we avoided check posts and two army camps,' the Karmapa said. The party - which included the Karmapa's 25-year-old sister - arrived undetected in Mustang, Nepal. They then trekked across dangerously crumbling paths in freezing conditions.</p> <p>The Karmapa finally arrived in Dharamsala eight days later, having travelled the rest of the journey by horse, helicopter, train and rented car. He then went straight to the Dalai Lama, who had made a similar escape across the snow-bound Himalayas in 1959 following China's invasion of Tibet. `He received me with his great love and affection.

Everything is neat and ordered - just as the 46-year-old left it before he set off for a four week adventure in Australia.</p> <p>The advertising executive flew in to Melbourne where he visited friends, then travelled up to Sydney where, after a few days, he joined a group heading out on a 14 day, 1,700 mile trip up the east coast to the Great Barrier Reef and on to Cairns.</p> <p>Four days later, Mr Eason disappeared. Nothing has been seen of him since. Five weeks on, his family are desperately awaiting news. On the morning of March 28, Mr Eason boarded a four-wheel drive minibus with a group of international travellers and headed for Fraser Island, the largest sand island in the world, a world heritage site where dingoes roam along white beaches.</p> <p>The group spent the morning making their way across the island. At 1pm they were dropped off at the vast white surfing beach at One Tree Rocks where they had the choice of walking up a clearly marked track to nearby Lake Wabby or staying on the bus. Mr Eason and four others chose to walk, agreeing to rendezvous at the car park at 3pm.</p> <p>A smoker on a non-smoking bus, Mr Eason took the opportunity to smoke when he disembarked. He sat on the beach and told his fellow travellers that he would catch them up. Police are convinced he has not left the island, but there have been no sightings. Two helicopter searches, one with heat seeking infra-red equipment, have found nothing. Quentin Davidson, the tour leader, said: `It's just strange, nobody knows. There were no signs that anything like this was going to happen.'</p> <p>The weather that day was changeable and, according to Mr Davidson, the sea was terrible. \"It wasn't a day when you would've taken all your clothes off and gone frolicking in the surf, but he [Mr Eason] wanted a bit of peaceful space.\"</p> <p>The beach is regarded as treacherous and there are signs warning people not to swim due to undertows and sharks. Mr Eason, a good sailor who had a healthy respect for the sea and a great fear of sharks, is unlikely to have gone swimming.</p> <p><b>Activities</b><br></p> <p>Mr Eason, creative director of VB Communications in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, gave no indication to his fellow tourists that he would up and leave. Mr Davidson said: \"David said he was a part owner of an agency that specialised in doing campaigns for the health industry. He said he was looking for a change of direction in his life. He wanted time out.</p> <p>\"He was a person very well at ease with his own company but when he wanted to be involved in a conversation he would. He was very much looking forward to the activities that were coming up on the second week.\"</p> <p>After looking for Mr Eason, Mr Davidson alerted police and local rangers but because it was dark, no proper search got under way until daybreak. By then, Mr Eason's family in Bromley, south-east London, had been told of his disappearance.</p> <p>Less than two days later, his sister Janice was in nearby Hervey Bay persuading police that her brother was not the type of man to go 'walkabout', asking why he would have booked an escorted tour if he wanted to roam around on his own and why would he leave his passport and tickets in the hotel?</p> <p>Afterwards, she travelled to Fraser Island where she joined a search and when that was called off, kept searching on her own. Now back in Bromley, Ms Eason is distraught and dumbfounded at her elder brother's disappearance.</p> <p>She said: \"I kept going over the area where he had been - looking for clues. The trail David was supposed to take, it's a gentle walk. There's nothing difficult about it. I walked the trails and it's just baffling to try and work out what happened. Personally I don't think it was an option that he got lost.</p> <p>\"Initially they thought he would have gone into the ocean but there's no trace of his backpack. The police have assured me that if he had gone into the sea there would have been a trace of that by now.</p> <p>\"We don't think he ever reached the lake. Why can no one find him? Personally, I am not convinced they have actually searched the area enough.\"</p> <p>Police told the family they are certain Mr Eason is still on the island. The tour guide recalls that police said if he was alive and wanted to be found they would have found him by now. He remembers another strange disappearance. \"Further up the coast there is a little place called Flaggy Rock. A couple of years ago a guy disappeared from a campsite there, with a car and a tent, and they never saw another thing of him nor did they find anything he was wearing.\"</p> <p><b>Sinister</b><br></p> <p>Ms Eason, her brother Peter and husband Mike Eames are angry that there is no continuing search. There will be a further search on May 5, but only as part of previously planned state-emergency exercise.</p> <p>The two men believe they are \"looking at a more sinister scenario.\" They feel Mr Eason may have been the victim of a robbery, that he may be lying buried in the sand. Every possible scenario has gone through their minds, including being swallowed up by a sand dune, or being the victim of a hit and run by the four wheel drive vehicles that roar up the beach.</p> <p>Ms Eason said: \"We have had to face the prospect that David may well not have survived what's happened. At the same time we are not going to be able to come to terms with that unless we know what's happened.\"</p> <p>Her brother Peter, who will head out to Australia tomorrow to search for his brother, says: \"Our ultimate goal is having the search resumed. We are looking for some intervention from the British government. The police there will do no more unless they are instructed to by a higher authority. We don't feel as if the Foreign Office is doing enough.\"</p> <p>Last night a Foreign Office spokesman said: \"Both the consular general in Brisbane and our consular staff in London have done everything possible to help resolve this situation. We have liaised directly with those in charge of the Australian investigation.</p> <p>\"We have kept the family informed at every stage. We have also initiated contact with various other government departments including Interpol and the UK police. We are determined to resolve this matter and have not given up.\"</p>",

The weather that day was changeable and, according to Mr Davidson, the sea was terrible. \"It wasn't a day when you would've taken all your clothes off and gone frolicking in the surf, but he [Mr Eason] wanted a bit of peaceful space.\" The beach is regarded as treacherous and there are signs warning people not to swim due to undertows and sharks. Mr Eason, a good sailor who had a healthy respect for the sea and a great fear of sharks, is unlikely to have gone swimming. Activities Mr Eason, creative director of VB Communications in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, gave no indication to his fellow tourists that he would up and leave. Mr Davidson said: \"David said he was a part owner of an agency that specialised in doing campaigns for the health industry. He said he was looking for a change of direction in his life. He wanted time out. \"He was a person very well at ease with his own company but when he wanted to be involved in a conversation he would. He was very much looking forward to the activities that were coming up on the second week.\" After looking for Mr Eason, Mr Davidson alerted police and local rangers but because it was dark, no proper search got under way until daybreak. By then, Mr Eason's family in Bromley, south-east London, had been told of his disappearance. Less than two days later, his sister Janice was in nearby Hervey Bay persuading police that her brother was not the type of man to go 'walkabout', asking why he would have booked an escorted tour if he wanted to roam around on his own and why would he leave his passport and tickets in the hotel? Afterwards, she travelled to Fraser Island where she joined a search and when that was called off, kept searching on her own. Now back in Bromley, Ms Eason is distraught and dumbfounded at her elder brother's disappearance. She said: \"I kept going over the area where he had been - looking for clues. The trail David was supposed to take, it's a gentle walk. There's nothing difficult about it. I walked the trails and it's just baffling to try and work out what happened. Personally I don't think it was an option that he got lost. \"Initially they thought he would have gone into the ocean but there's no trace of his backpack. The police have assured me that if he had gone into the sea there would have been a trace of that by now. \"We don't think he ever reached the lake. Why can no one find him? Personally, I am not convinced they have actually searched the area enough.\" Police told the family they are certain Mr Eason is still on the island. The tour guide recalls that police said if he was alive and wanted to be found they would have found him by now. He remembers another strange disappearance. \"Further up the coast there is a little place called Flaggy Rock. A couple of years ago a guy disappeared from a campsite there, with a car and a tent, and they never saw another thing of him nor did they find anything he was wearing.\" Sinister Ms Eason, her brother Peter and husband Mike Eames are angry that there is no continuing search. There will be a further search on May 5, but only as part of previously planned state-emergency exercise. The two men believe they are \"looking at a more sinister scenario.\" They feel Mr Eason may have been the victim of a robbery, that he may be lying buried in the sand. Every possible scenario has gone through their minds, including being swallowed up by a sand dune, or being the victim of a hit and run by the four wheel drive vehicles that roar up the beach. Ms Eason said: \"We have had to face the prospect that David may well not have survived what's happened. At the same time we are not going to be able to come to terms with that unless we know what's happened.\" Her brother Peter, who will head out to Australia tomorrow to search for his brother, says: \"Our ultimate goal is having the search resumed. We are looking for some intervention from the British government. The police there will do no more unless they are instructed to by a higher authority. We don't feel as if the Foreign Office is doing enough.\" Last night a Foreign Office spokesman said: \"Both the consular general in Brisbane and our consular staff in London have done everything possible to help resolve this situation. We have liaised directly with those in charge of the Australian investigation. \"We have kept the family informed at every stage. We have also initiated contact with various other government departments including Interpol and the UK police. We are determined to resolve this matter and have not given up.\"",

      "body": "<p>Knaptoft: an apology. It has been drawn to Smallweed's attention that this column recently referred to the delightful village of Knaptoft, Leicestershire, as Knapcroft. I would like to offer an unreserved apology to the people, institutions and livestock of Knaptoft, to their friends and relations, their ostlers within and without, their helots, understrappers, retainers and tracklements, for this undeserved slur on their reputation. I have arrayed myself in sackcloth and ashes, and intend to parade along the A50, which passes this delectable spot, wearing sandwich boards bearing the slogan: \"Woe is Smallweed. In his dotage, he can no longer distinguish between a toft and a croft.\" </p> <p>I would like also to take this opportunity to apologise to the people of Knapcroft in case the above apology should in any way be taken to imply that the village of Knapcroft is in any way less estimable than the village of Knaptoft. True, I can find no Knapcroft on the map, but one can't be too careful nowadays, with so many lawyers about.</p> <p><strong> A lawyer writes:</strong> Would it not also be wise for Smallweed to extend his apology to cover such communities as Knapdale, Argyllshire, Knapthorpe in Nottinghamshire, and Knapwell, Cambridgeshire, not to mention a number of Knaptons, lest the value of local homes and hereditaments is taken to have been reduced by his failure to mention them in the aforesaid? Thank you. That will be 50 guineas. </p> <p>There seems to be no end nowadays of people writing biographies claiming to prove that saints were sinners, and vice versa. But I never expected to see a campaign mounted to redeem the name of the rector of Stiffkey, Harold Davidson. On April 17, the Daily Telegraph (of which Charles Moore is still editor) published a letter from Lord Walsingham, who had got wind of this enterprise. \"My godfather,\" he wrote, \"a distinguished veteran of the South African war . . . once kicked the Rev Harold Davidson down the steps of his house when he called. The man was a fantasist and an exhibitionist, whose sexual practices remained suspect . . . Incidentally, I took his record from him for living at the top of a pole in 1956, when I spent longer up the canal station mast at El Cap during the Suez campaign. I was able to plot the minefield laid by the Egyptians at El Kantera by counting their steps as they paced it out through my telescope . . .\" Well, once up the pole, up the pole for ever, as the Marquis of Vauvenargues once remarked in a different context, but this outburst did provoke two instructive replies, printed on Tuesday. These disputed the usual accounts of Davidson's fall from grace, which describe how he was defrocked by the Church of England for bad behaviour (especially with young women), found a job in a circus, and was eaten alive by a censorious lion in 1937. His granddaughter, Karilyn Collier of London N7, insists that his fall resulted from the Norfolk establishment's desperation to get rid of a radical socialist priest. </p> <p>\"According to local people,\" wrote JB Shrive of Holt, Norfolk, \"the rector was the victim of a conspiracy by members of the local squirearchy, to whom he had been bold enough to comment on the moral deficiencies of their own lives.\" I may well find myself moved to array myself in sackcloth and ashes and parade along the A149, which passes close to this delectable village, wearing sandwich boards bearing the slogan: \"Woe is Smallweed. All these years he has been ignorantly traducing the memory of a great Christian socialist gentleman.\" </p> <p> I am a big devotee of the weekend programmes on Radio 3 hosted by Edward Seckerson. I sometimes feel guilty at having serious music playing at such an hour, but over the years it has introduced me to all sorts of work I did not know and was able to study later, as well as filling my head with instructive anecdotes. Last weekend, for instance, he told us that Francis Poulenc had said that Faur\u00e9's Requiem was one of the few things in music he could not stand. It may have been just as well that Faur\u00e9 took the precaution of dying in 1924, thus sparing himself the experience of hearing Poulenc's Gloria, written in 1959. </p> <p>Later, Seckerson treated us to a work by the almost unheard-of English composer Harold Truscott - his Elegy for String Orchestra, a work of real anguish written in 1943 as a long relationship with one of his students was breaking up. Truscott, he said, had been banned from the airwaves by William Glock in the mid-50s, and only one recital, by John Ogdon in 1969, got through. As it happened, though, I heard what I think was the Elegy, then recently recorded on the Marco Polo label, on Radio 3 in 1995 and wrote about it in this column, recounting how his father discovered the teenage Truscott copying Bach note by note on to manuscript staves, and promptly had him committed to an asylum. </p> <p>Guy Rickards, whom Seckerson credited with discovering the elegy among Truscott's papers, wrote an affectionate tribute in this newspaper in 1992, commemorating him as composer and teacher. \"Who else outside Switzerland,\" Rickards wrote, \"even knew the name of Fritz Brun, let alone that his fourth symphony was in E major?\" Fritz Brun, however, makes it into the new Grove Musical Dictionary. Truscott, unjustly I think, does not. I may well array myself in sackcloth and ashes and parade along the A616, close to Huddersfield, where he taught for 22 years, wearing sandwich boards bearing the slogan: \"Posthumous justice NOW for Harold Truscott\". </p> <p> And so again to lampreys, a surfeit of which, I alleged last week, did for Henry I. A reader asks if I am sure that it wasn't Henry II.

      "bodyText": "Knaptoft: an apology. It has been drawn to Smallweed's attention that this column recently referred to the delightful village of Knaptoft, Leicestershire, as Knapcroft. I would like to offer an unreserved apology to the people, institutions and livestock of Knaptoft, to their friends and relations, their ostlers within and without, their helots, understrappers, retainers and tracklements, for this undeserved slur on their reputation. I have arrayed myself in sackcloth and ashes, and intend to parade along the A50, which passes this delectable spot, wearing sandwich boards bearing the slogan: \"Woe is Smallweed. In his dotage, he can no longer distinguish between a toft and a croft.\" I would like also to take this opportunity to apologise to the people of Knapcroft in case the above apology should in any way be taken to imply that the village of Knapcroft is in any way less estimable than the village of Knaptoft. True, I can find no Knapcroft on the map, but one can't be too careful nowadays, with so many lawyers about. A lawyer writes: Would it not also be wise for Smallweed to extend his apology to cover such communities as Knapdale, Argyllshire, Knapthorpe in Nottinghamshire, and Knapwell, Cambridgeshire, not to mention a number of Knaptons, lest the value of local homes and hereditaments is taken to have been reduced by his failure to mention them in the aforesaid? Thank you. That will be 50 guineas. There seems to be no end nowadays of people writing biographies claiming to prove that saints were sinners, and vice versa. But I never expected to see a campaign mounted to redeem the name of the rector of Stiffkey, Harold Davidson. On April 17, the Daily Telegraph (of which Charles Moore is still editor) published a letter from Lord Walsingham, who had got wind of this enterprise. \"My godfather,\" he wrote, \"a distinguished veteran of the South African war . . . once kicked the Rev Harold Davidson down the steps of his house when he called. The man was a fantasist and an exhibitionist, whose sexual practices remained suspect . . . Incidentally, I took his record from him for living at the top of a pole in 1956, when I spent longer up the canal station mast at El Cap during the Suez campaign. I was able to plot the minefield laid by the Egyptians at El Kantera by counting their steps as they paced it out through my telescope . . .\" Well, once up the pole, up the pole for ever, as the Marquis of Vauvenargues once remarked in a different context, but this outburst did provoke two instructive replies, printed on Tuesday. These disputed the usual accounts of Davidson's fall from grace, which describe how he was defrocked by the Church of England for bad behaviour (especially with young women), found a job in a circus, and was eaten alive by a censorious lion in 1937. His granddaughter, Karilyn Collier of London N7, insists that his fall resulted from the Norfolk establishment's desperation to get rid of a radical socialist priest. \"According to local people,\" wrote JB Shrive of Holt, Norfolk, \"the rector was the victim of a conspiracy by members of the local squirearchy, to whom he had been bold enough to comment on the moral deficiencies of their own lives.\" I may well find myself moved to array myself in sackcloth and ashes and parade along the A149, which passes close to this delectable village, wearing sandwich boards bearing the slogan: \"Woe is Smallweed. All these years he has been ignorantly traducing the memory of a great Christian socialist gentleman.\" I am a big devotee of the weekend programmes on Radio 3 hosted by Edward Seckerson. I sometimes feel guilty at having serious music playing at such an hour, but over the years it has introduced me to all sorts of work I did not know and was able to study later, as well as filling my head with instructive anecdotes. Last weekend, for instance, he told us that Francis Poulenc had said that Faur\u00e9's Requiem was one of the few things in music he could not stand. It may have been just as well that Faur\u00e9 took the precaution of dying in 1924, thus sparing himself the experience of hearing Poulenc's Gloria, written in 1959. Later, Seckerson treated us to a work by the almost unheard-of English composer Harold Truscott - his Elegy for String Orchestra, a work of real anguish written in 1943 as a long relationship with one of his students was breaking up. Truscott, he said, had been banned from the airwaves by William Glock in the mid-50s, and only one recital, by John Ogdon in 1969, got through. As it happened, though, I heard what I think was the Elegy, then recently recorded on the Marco Polo label, on Radio 3 in 1995 and wrote about it in this column, recounting how his father discovered the teenage Truscott copying Bach note by note on to manuscript staves, and promptly had him committed to an asylum. Guy Rickards, whom Seckerson credited with discovering the elegy among Truscott's papers, wrote an affectionate tribute in this newspaper in 1992, commemorating him as composer and teacher. \"Who else outside Switzerland,\" Rickards wrote, \"even knew the name of Fritz Brun, let alone that his fourth symphony was in E major?\" Fritz Brun, however, makes it into the new Grove Musical Dictionary. Truscott, unjustly I think, does not. I may well array myself in sackcloth and ashes and parade along the A616, close to Huddersfield, where he taught for 22 years, wearing sandwich boards bearing the slogan: \"Posthumous justice NOW for Harold Truscott\". And so again to lampreys, a surfeit of which, I alleged last week, did for Henry I. A reader asks if I am sure that it wasn't Henry II. I shall stick to Henry I if I may, and not just to save space.The Dictionary of National Biography says HI fell sick while hunting in the forest of Lyon, \"his illness, it is said, being brought on by eating lampreys contrary to the orders of his physician\"; while HII died of a fever at Chinon after a war with Philip II of France and his own son Richard.

There was the Albert Hall, of course, which came into its own every summer for the Proms, as it still does. The Wigmore Hall retained its special position for song recitals and chamber music and, in those days, as the place where young performers would hope to make their London debuts. When the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell Room were added to the South Bank complex in the late 1960s there really was a space for everything, from the most intimate to the grandest occasion. </p> <p>So when I began going regularly to concerts in London in the early 1970s, the RFH was the place to be. I was lucky in my timing too; it was an era when the London orchestras were vying with each other for supremacy, and still able to attract the world's greatest conductors and soloists. With Bernard Haitink in charge of the London Philharmonic, Riccardo Muti at the Philharmonia, Andr\u00e9 Previn with the London Symphony, and the likes of Georg Solti, Carlo Maria Giulini, Eugen Jochum and Karl B\u00f6hm regular guests with these orchestras, the standard repertory was presented in a thrilling and diverse way. Pierre Boulez was beginning to make his presence really felt with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, too. </p> <p>It is Boulez's concerts from that period that stick in the mind most of all - especially performances of Schoenberg's two great unfinished masterpieces, Jakobsleiter (which I've never heard live since) and Moses und Aron, but also the works by Webern, Berg, Debussy and Ravel that were then the core of his repertory. There was also new music, including his own. There seemed to be a thrill of discovery about every concert, a real sense of adventure; audiences went along with it, and were rewarded with imperishable memories. </p> <p>There were piano recitals by Serkin, Curzon, Richter, Arrau, Rubinstein, Gilels and Michelangeli - an astonishing line-up in just a couple of seasons - and Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 playing the Elgar Cello Concerto for the last time (though, of course, no one knew it then) on a Sunday afternoon with the Philharmonia and Zubin Mehta. The 20-year-old Simon Rattle made his London debut with the premiere of Peter Maxwell Davies's First Symphony, and even the elusive Carlos Kleiber, still the most thrilling conductor I've ever heard, was tempted to the RFH for the occasional incandescent appearance. </p> <p>Perhaps it was the end of a golden age, but there is no doubt that the public for classical music in those days was more focused, and its appetite seemed insatiable. Any chance to hear the world's top stars was eagerly seized. When Herbert von Karajan came to London with the Berlin Philharmonic for two concerts of Brahms symphonies (one of which, amazingly, clashed with a recital by Sviatoslav Richter next door in the Queen Elizabeth Hall), tickets were priced astronomically, but there was a queue at the box office before dawn on the day booking opened. </p> <p>This isn't just dewy-eyed nostalgia, I think, or even my being more appreciative of what was on offer in the days when I had to pay for my tickets. There really was more high-quality, innovative concert-giving in London then, and the RFH naturally got the lion's share of it. Events such as the British premiere of Stockhausen's evening-long Momente, directed by the composer, with the singers and players erupting on to the stage from all corners of the auditorium, just don't happen any more. There isn't the money for them, nor, one suspects, the artistic will. </p> <p>Like Britain itself, it all began to change in the 1980s. In 1982 the RFH lost its monopoly on orchestral concerts when the Barbican Centre opened. The new hall became home to the LSO, now with Claudio Abbado at the helm, and was generously supported by the City of London, so that financial equality between the capital's orchestras was undermined. The situation was exacerbated as the stringencies of Thatcherism began to bite. No longer able to rely on its exclusivity, the RFH had to reinvent itself, and it did so with a fair degree of success through that decade. But there was still plenty to hear, and still a sprinkling, though a smaller proportion, of important events. It was only in the 1990s that the strain really began to show. </p> <p>Though an important and rightly celebrated anniversary like this may not be the most tactful time to say so, the RFH now is a pale shadow of its former self, artistically as well as physically, and shows absolutely no signs of getting itself back on track. Of course it had to change; one of the most important innovations that occurred during Nicholas Snowman's tenure as chief executive was the opening up of the foyers to non-ticket holders during the daytime, with cafes, book and record shops providing somewhere to while away the odd half-hour, even when there were no concerts going on. </p> <p>Snowman at least maintained quality control over the programming; he introduced the idea of resident orchestras and ensembles on the South Bank and mounted some important retrospectives - those devoted to Berio and Birtwistle particularly lodge in the memory. But even he was losing his enthusiasm by the time he left in 1998, driven to distraction by the constant postponements of the long-mooted redevelopment. Since then the place has seemed to be in freefall: the programming has acquired an increasing air of desperation as it falls over itself to try to be all things to all punters, and fails to satisfy any part of its constituency in the process. </p> <p>At least the resident orchestras, the Philharmonia and the London Philharmonic, who have finally put the years of duelling over favoured status well behind them, still maintain high standards. (Though across the river the LSO does consistently manage to offer more alluring programmes.) The regular visits from the Concertgebouw Orchestra from Amsterdam and the Vienna Philharmonic add a frisson of international excitement to the season, and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and the London Sinfonietta in their own specialist fields add another strand of excellence.

The Barbican is just a nicer, more inspiring place to hear orchestral music nowadays, and much more likely to offer something that is genuinely adventurous and worthwhile. </p> <p>The faded, tattered fabric of the place doesn't help, and long-term planning has been compromised by the uncertainty over the redevelopment that has been proposed for so long, but still shows barely any sign of coming to fruition. (With far less fuss, the Barbican starts on the first phase of its refurbishment next month.) Funding for any major initiatives, too, is tighter than it has ever been. But none of that is any excuse for the complacency that seems to cast a pall over so much of the programme nowadays, or for a lack of real flair in what is presented.

      "body": "<p>Mogamat Benjamin has been in prison for 34 years and has killed more people - mostly fellow inmates - than he can remember. He has beheaded and mutilated their corpses. He has - along with other members of his gang - cut out his victims' hearts and eaten them in a grim, semi-mystical ritual in which the life-force of the victim passes into the bodies of the killers. Mogamat holds the rank of general in the gang known as the 28s. </p> <p>\"I am powerful,\" he told us. \"I am partly God. No man has a higher rank in Pollsmoor than me. In the camp of the 28s a person's life is in my hands. The final decision is mine. There are people who I said should be killed and they were killed.\" </p> <p>Mogamat has murdered, maimed and raped his way to the top of a pyramid of power in South Africa's prisons. The system is known as \"the Number\". It exerts a powerful hold over those who join it. The devotion it demands of them is absolute. </p> <p>These are no idle boasts. For years, Pollsmoor has had a murder and assault rate that matches the anecdotal claims. Prison warders patrol the passages. But after lock-up time, behind the steel doors, the prison belongs to the gang leaders. </p> <p>\"Their power grows and grows,\" says Barry Coetzee, a prison warder. \"It feels as if they are taking over. It's not the warders who have control of the prison any more. The Numbers control the prison. They make the decisions.\" </p> <p>Coetzee has reason to feel afraid. He has been warned that he has been selected by the gang leaders as a future target. Someone in the gang structure - he doesn't know who - has been ordered to stab him as a test of courage and loyalty to the gang. This is known as \"calling a number\". </p> <p>\"A number has been called on me,\" says Coetzee. \"I will be stabbed or cut with a blade. My blood has to flow. There's no way to defend yourself. You never know when, you never know where. It's terrifying. It's a psychological war.\" </p> <p>Erefaan Jacobs is Mogamat's second-in-command. He holds the rank of judge. It is his job to \"try\" gang members who break gang law and to decide on appropriate punishment. He, too, has ordered that disloyal and mistrusted members be killed. He also punishes any sign of fear in new recruits. </p> <p>\"When you join the gang, I will not allow any fear from you,\" he says. \"We develop you in such a way that you will become fearless. You can only come into the camp [of the 28s] by spilling blood. We do not have scared people in our camp. If you're scared, you will betray us. If we see you're scared, we'll kill you. It has happened. Many people's heads were cut off in cells where I was present. I see that tonight we will kill this man. The whole day I know it. I will talk with you, laugh with you. But I know that tonight we will kill you.\" </p> <p>Erefaan's face is covered in tattoos. \"Spit on my Grave\" is tattooed across his forehead; \"I hate you, Mum\" etched into his left cheek. The tattoos are an expression of loyalty. The men cut the emblems of their allegiance into their skin. The Number demands not only that you pledge your oath verbally but that you be marked, indelibly, for life. Facial tattoos are the ultimate abandonment of all hope of a life outside. </p> <p>The Numbers gangs have their origin in the violence of white rule. The 28s are the oldest gang. They were founded in 1906 as a revolt by 28 black prisoners. The gang quickly became a way for its members to defy - and protect themselves against - the atrocities of the white prison regime. It developed its own military-style hierarchy, its own elaborate codes of punishment and reward, and its own sexual mores. For what distinguishes the men of the 28s is sex. They are known as the men who have sex with each other in the night. An intricate protocol determines which new recruits will serve as sexual partners for which established gang members. The gang officers take regular sexual partners, known as \"wyfies\", who win membership of the gang - and with it the gang's protection - in return for sexual obedience. </p> <p>It was as a revolt against sodomy that the second main gang was formed - the 27s. They are known in prison as the men of blood. Their loyalty to their officers is tested by stabbing warders and other inmates. In Pollsmoor Maximum, almost half the warders have been stabbed or cut at least once. </p> <p>The gang known as the 26 also repudiate sex between men. They prove their loyalty by robbing warders and fellow inmates of whatever material possessions can be smuggled in. </p> <p>In cell 191, the men of the 26 sleep on the west side of the room, where the sun comes up, because their principal activity takes place during the hours of day light. The men of the 28 sleep on the east side, where the sun sets, because they are men of the night. It is a pattern repeated across South Africa, for the Numbers gangs operate in all South Africa's prisons, and inmates transferred from one prison to another must demonstrate a knowledge of gang culture, beliefs and practices in order to be accepted into the camp in the new prison. </p> <p>But Pollsmoor is pioneering a new approach to the prison gang culture. Jonny Jansen is the first black man to head the maximum-security wing. He recognises that the origins of the system - and the hierarchy of violence that sustains it - lie in apartheid. So he has persuaded leading gang members - including Mogamat and Erefaan - to join a programme known as Change is Possible. The South African film-makers Cliff Bestall and Pearlie Joubert got exclusive access to film a series of remarkable and - at times - breathtaking workshops in which the country's most hardened killers are forced to confront themselves - to examine who they are and the evil that has so blighted them - for the first time in their lives. It is an astonishing experiment in human nature, an attempt to reach into the souls of mass murderers and multiple rapists to see whether they can be changed. As a BBC journalist I visited the prison and narrated the film. The workshops are run by Joanna Thomas from Cape Town's Centre for Conflict Resolution. She is a striking feminine presence in the masculine, emotion-free zone of Pollsmoor Maximum. </p> <p>She leads them into an isolated cell on the roof of the prison. It is the cell where Nelson Mandela was held for six years after being moved from Robben Island. It is the room where he began his dialogue with the old apartheid regime - the room where South Africa began to change.

      "bodyText": "Mogamat Benjamin has been in prison for 34 years and has killed more people - mostly fellow inmates - than he can remember. He has beheaded and mutilated their corpses. He has - along with other members of his gang - cut out his victims' hearts and eaten them in a grim, semi-mystical ritual in which the life-force of the victim passes into the bodies of the killers. Mogamat holds the rank of general in the gang known as the 28s. \"I am powerful,\" he told us. \"I am partly God. No man has a higher rank in Pollsmoor than me. In the camp of the 28s a person's life is in my hands. The final decision is mine. There are people who I said should be killed and they were killed.\" Mogamat has murdered, maimed and raped his way to the top of a pyramid of power in South Africa's prisons. The system is known as \"the Number\". It exerts a powerful hold over those who join it. The devotion it demands of them is absolute. These are no idle boasts. For years, Pollsmoor has had a murder and assault rate that matches the anecdotal claims. Prison warders patrol the passages. But after lock-up time, behind the steel doors, the prison belongs to the gang leaders. \"Their power grows and grows,\" says Barry Coetzee, a prison warder. \"It feels as if they are taking over. It's not the warders who have control of the prison any more. The Numbers control the prison. They make the decisions.\" Coetzee has reason to feel afraid. He has been warned that he has been selected by the gang leaders as a future target. Someone in the gang structure - he doesn't know who - has been ordered to stab him as a test of courage and loyalty to the gang. This is known as \"calling a number\". \"A number has been called on me,\" says Coetzee. \"I will be stabbed or cut with a blade. My blood has to flow. There's no way to defend yourself. You never know when, you never know where. It's terrifying. It's a psychological war.\" Erefaan Jacobs is Mogamat's second-in-command. He holds the rank of judge. It is his job to \"try\" gang members who break gang law and to decide on appropriate punishment. He, too, has ordered that disloyal and mistrusted members be killed. He also punishes any sign of fear in new recruits. \"When you join the gang, I will not allow any fear from you,\" he says. \"We develop you in such a way that you will become fearless. You can only come into the camp [of the 28s] by spilling blood. We do not have scared people in our camp. If you're scared, you will betray us. If we see you're scared, we'll kill you. It has happened. Many people's heads were cut off in cells where I was present. I see that tonight we will kill this man. The whole day I know it. I will talk with you, laugh with you. But I know that tonight we will kill you.\" Erefaan's face is covered in tattoos. \"Spit on my Grave\" is tattooed across his forehead; \"I hate you, Mum\" etched into his left cheek. The tattoos are an expression of loyalty. The men cut the emblems of their allegiance into their skin. The Number demands not only that you pledge your oath verbally but that you be marked, indelibly, for life. Facial tattoos are the ultimate abandonment of all hope of a life outside. The Numbers gangs have their origin in the violence of white rule. The 28s are the oldest gang. They were founded in 1906 as a revolt by 28 black prisoners. The gang quickly became a way for its members to defy - and protect themselves against - the atrocities of the white prison regime. It developed its own military-style hierarchy, its own elaborate codes of punishment and reward, and its own sexual mores. For what distinguishes the men of the 28s is sex. They are known as the men who have sex with each other in the night. An intricate protocol determines which new recruits will serve as sexual partners for which established gang members. The gang officers take regular sexual partners, known as \"wyfies\", who win membership of the gang - and with it the gang's protection - in return for sexual obedience. It was as a revolt against sodomy that the second main gang was formed - the 27s. They are known in prison as the men of blood. Their loyalty to their officers is tested by stabbing warders and other inmates. In Pollsmoor Maximum, almost half the warders have been stabbed or cut at least once. The gang known as the 26 also repudiate sex between men. They prove their loyalty by robbing warders and fellow inmates of whatever material possessions can be smuggled in. In cell 191, the men of the 26 sleep on the west side of the room, where the sun comes up, because their principal activity takes place during the hours of day light. The men of the 28 sleep on the east side, where the sun sets, because they are men of the night. It is a pattern repeated across South Africa, for the Numbers gangs operate in all South Africa's prisons, and inmates transferred from one prison to another must demonstrate a knowledge of gang culture, beliefs and practices in order to be accepted into the camp in the new prison. But Pollsmoor is pioneering a new approach to the prison gang culture. Jonny Jansen is the first black man to head the maximum-security wing. He recognises that the origins of the system - and the hierarchy of violence that sustains it - lie in apartheid. So he has persuaded leading gang members - including Mogamat and Erefaan - to join a programme known as Change is Possible. The South African film-makers Cliff Bestall and Pearlie Joubert got exclusive access to film a series of remarkable and - at times - breathtaking workshops in which the country's most hardened killers are forced to confront themselves - to examine who they are and the evil that has so blighted them - for the first time in their lives. It is an astonishing experiment in human nature, an attempt to reach into the souls of mass murderers and multiple rapists to see whether they can be changed. As a BBC journalist I visited the prison and narrated the film. The workshops are run by Joanna Thomas from Cape Town's Centre for Conflict Resolution. She is a striking feminine presence in the masculine, emotion-free zone of Pollsmoor Maximum. She leads them into an isolated cell on the roof of the prison. It is the cell where Nelson Mandela was held for six years after being moved from Robben Island. It is the room where he began his dialogue with the old apartheid regime - the room where South Africa began to change. Change is its purpose again. It takes her 10 days to break down their resistance. At first they see her as a threat to the Numbers system. Some threaten to stab her. Eventually she wins the cooperation of a small group who see in her a chance for change. But they in turn must endure the taunts and threats of their fellow inmates. Suspicion spreads about what Thomas is up to in her rooftop workshops. One member of the 27s issues an explicit threat: \"You who give the Number away - you must be killed. That's how the Number is.\" On the last day, they face the toughest test. Thomas forces them to talk about their families - their wives, their children. But, tellingly, it is when they talk about their fathers that the floodgates open. There is not a single man in the room who can recall an affectionate male presence in his childhood. \"I, too, lacked fatherly love,\" says one. \"That's why I'm glad I met all of you, in prison. You gave me that.\" It is a powerful and extraordinary moment to witness - a fleeting instant when the humanity seems to seep back into these most dehumanised of human beings. It is what motivates Thomas to come back into this place day after day. \"I am not so naive as to believe that one series of workshops can change a man who has been in the heart of the gang system for most of his life.

It is, consciously or not, based on Orwell's premise that political speeches and speechwriting are the defence of the indefensible. When the Blairesque leader made a speech near the end of the play, defending the indefensible, I felt the pull of meaningless demagogy; it was a moment when the play transcended farce.

      "body": "<p>Tasmin Little, violinist </p> <p> I first performed at the Royal Festival Hall in 1989. I like the hall very much indeed; it was probably quite trendy at the time it was built, and now it looks slightly old-fashioned - but I rather like that. </p> <p>It makes me feel nostalgic. The outside belies what goes on inside. It looks rather daunting - bit of a concrete block - but in fact it's very warm and welcoming and they've done a lot to it. It's now quite diverse inside, what with the CD shop and bookshop and cafeterias. </p> <p>I enjoy the atmosphere of the hall and walking out on to the stage there, and I like the layout of the auditorium from the audience point of view. With the boxes and the seats at the sides and behind you in the choir, you get the feeling that your audience is all around you. It feels genuinely intimate. </p> <p>Last year I performed the Ligeti concerto in the final concert of the Towards the Millennium festival with Sir Simon Rattle, which was a 10-year-long event celebrating all the music of the 20th century. It felt like a really momentous occasion because it completely sold out, and we had the most fantastic audience. It was a real night to remember. </p> <p> <strong> Keith Miller, RFH employee for 40 years</strong> </p> <p> My involvement with the hall started as a hobby. First I was a steward for about 18 months, and then I was transferred backstage, where I was responsible for looking after the artists, keeping the programme running to time. </p> <p>I have looked after the Princess of Wales and Prince Charles, Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother. When the Queen Mother comes we always have to remember to put a little cushion on her seat so that she can see over the balcony because she's so tiny. Princess Anne always sits in the auditorium rather than in the royal box, and even though we always book the row in front and behind, people have no idea that she is there. </p> <p>I once had to have words with Spike Milligan; he was chatting with friends after one of the concerts. When I asked him if he would leave the auditorium, he said he had no intention of taking it with him. </p> <p>One of the most poignant moments I can remember was the day after the Aberfan mining disaster in 1966 when about 3,000 schoolchildren attended a concert. Most of them were unaware of what had happened. They were all chattering away making a terrific noise, but backstage there was hardly a dry eye in the house. </p> <p> <strong> John Peel, broadcaster and curator of the RFH's 1998 Meltdown festival</strong> </p> <p> I wasn't very keen on organising the festival at first because it clashed with the World Cup, but David Sefton asked me to do it and he's basically a nice chap. So we set up the hall with screens so that people could watch the football if they wanted to. That's why I changed my mind. </p> <p>My main memory would have to be one balmy evening when I was standing on the riverside with my back to the balcony: on one side I could hear Culture playing and on the other Extreme Noise Terror in the Queen Elizabeth Hall - they're good Ipswich lads, probably the best at what they do. </p> <p>I could smell the waves of ganja wafting towards me and I thought, \"I've done all this.\" It was my moment of vanity, if you like.

      "bodyText": "Tasmin Little, violinist I first performed at the Royal Festival Hall in 1989. I like the hall very much indeed; it was probably quite trendy at the time it was built, and now it looks slightly old-fashioned - but I rather like that. It makes me feel nostalgic. The outside belies what goes on inside. It looks rather daunting - bit of a concrete block - but in fact it's very warm and welcoming and they've done a lot to it. It's now quite diverse inside, what with the CD shop and bookshop and cafeterias. I enjoy the atmosphere of the hall and walking out on to the stage there, and I like the layout of the auditorium from the audience point of view. With the boxes and the seats at the sides and behind you in the choir, you get the feeling that your audience is all around you. It feels genuinely intimate. Last year I performed the Ligeti concerto in the final concert of the Towards the Millennium festival with Sir Simon Rattle, which was a 10-year-long event celebrating all the music of the 20th century. It felt like a really momentous occasion because it completely sold out, and we had the most fantastic audience. It was a real night to remember. Keith Miller, RFH employee for 40 years My involvement with the hall started as a hobby. First I was a steward for about 18 months, and then I was transferred backstage, where I was responsible for looking after the artists, keeping the programme running to time. I have looked after the Princess of Wales and Prince Charles, Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother. When the Queen Mother comes we always have to remember to put a little cushion on her seat so that she can see over the balcony because she's so tiny. Princess Anne always sits in the auditorium rather than in the royal box, and even though we always book the row in front and behind, people have no idea that she is there. I once had to have words with Spike Milligan; he was chatting with friends after one of the concerts. When I asked him if he would leave the auditorium, he said he had no intention of taking it with him. One of the most poignant moments I can remember was the day after the Aberfan mining disaster in 1966 when about 3,000 schoolchildren attended a concert. Most of them were unaware of what had happened. They were all chattering away making a terrific noise, but backstage there was hardly a dry eye in the house. John Peel, broadcaster and curator of the RFH's 1998 Meltdown festival I wasn't very keen on organising the festival at first because it clashed with the World Cup, but David Sefton asked me to do it and he's basically a nice chap. So we set up the hall with screens so that people could watch the football if they wanted to. That's why I changed my mind. My main memory would have to be one balmy evening when I was standing on the riverside with my back to the balcony: on one side I could hear Culture playing and on the other Extreme Noise Terror in the Queen Elizabeth Hall - they're good Ipswich lads, probably the best at what they do. I could smell the waves of ganja wafting towards me and I thought, \"I've done all this.\" It was my moment of vanity, if you like. What really mattered was that I could have people that I wanted to see - and the venue has a certain cache about it because it is the RFH. The wonderful thing about the hall is that the people who work there have a really relaxed attitude. Extreme Noise Terror probably aren't everyone's cup of tea, but you don't get staff telling people not to dance and enjoy themselves. Valerie Solti, patron of the Friends of the London Philharmonic Orchestra My acquaintance with the RFH goes right back to the beginning.

If I was blindfolded and taken there I'd always know exactly where I was.

Karsten Witt, chief executive of the South Bank Centre At the moment we are in the middle of transforming the building completely. I imagine how wonderful it must have been in 1951. The impression must have been overwhelming, with the light coming into the building from all sides and the astonishing views. I am at the RFH probably every other night.

Bee pollen is a complete food, with protein-building amino acids and twice as much calcium as milk, weight for weight, says nutrition consultant Susan Fletcher.</p> <p>Propolis is the brown, resinous \"glue\" that bees use to seal the cells in the hive. The bees collect it from the sap of trees, and when these trees have strong antibiotic properties - as the poplar, willow and birch do - the propolis transfers these antibiotic benefits to the hive, and thus to the honey itself. Propolis also inhibits dental plaque, which makes propolis toothpaste - available in most health-food stores - a great alternative to the standard white gunge. And propolis-enriched honey, mixed with a little warm water, can be dripped into the ear to help combat bacterial ear infections.</p> <p>It is the antiviral properties of propolis that make it good for cold sores, but it also has anti-fungal benefits, so honey with added propolis makes a great remedy for athlete's foot. Propolis has even been found to inhibit the antibiotic-resistant superbug Staphylococcus aureus.</p> <p>But you can't use just any old honey. It is important to buy organic honey that has not been heat-treated above hive temperature, as this kills the active compounds. And not all honey is equally effective. Single-source honey, such as pine, lavender or thyme, are recommended; the most potent of all, however, is New Zealand manuka honey. The bees gather pollen from the manuka, or tea tree, which is renowned for its healing properties. When applied to wounds, surgical scars or burns, the honey clears up bacteria, keeps the wound supple and clean and reduces scarring. It also helps prevent the wound smelling.</p> <p>While there is a lot of manuka honey produced, the most effective is thought to be the honey that is certified as containing \"active manuka\". Because of its antibacterial action, manuka honey is a powerful ally against gastritis (usually felt as indigestion) caused by the bacteria Helicobacter pylori, which invades the stomach lining, acting as an irritant and causing inflammation. However, a teaspoon of manuka, three times a day, slowly kills the H. pylori. Fletcher, whose husband is a bee-keeper, has had plenty of success with local honey. \"We use our UK-made honey for dressing wounds to avoid scarring,\" she says. \"I had one client who was treated for gastro-enteritis for several years, and within three months of taking this honey he was fine.\"</p> <p>Honey is no slouch in the beauty stakes, either - it's a great moisturiser.

      "body": "<p>I was really pleased to see this week that that horrible swill Le Piat D'Or - which, I blush to say, my first husband often impressed me with when I was a green young teen - is to be re-launched and re-branded, so dire have its sales been recently; down by \u00a310m since the 80s. Out go those annoying ads of the silly, chic French couple getting dressed while the rude, early guests wait at the door bearing a bottle of it, as if that was the answer to everything! </p> <p>Out goes the line \"Les Fran\u00e7ais adorent le Piat D'Or.\" The reason? \"France and the French are no longer aspirational,\" says Emma Chamberlain, the drink's marketing manager. Apparently your average winey would rather have a beaker of the warm Antipodes, and I'm not surprised. With wine, as with no other drink, the aspirational and lifestyle sway is high, and it seems quite understandable that a modern, friendly, sunny country like Oz would be more on our mind when we kicked back with a glass of the grape on yet another freezing spring evening than the thought of crumbly, snooty old Paree, where there's just as much rain and twice as much dog muck.</p> <p>Hopefully we've seen the back of what that Czech intellectual refugee - dazzled by the liberty and culture of postwar Britain, amazed that our chattering classes were so in thrall to the French - named in the 50s as \"French flu\". Because it's certainly been with us until extremely recently. Ah, the French! Never mind that they collaborated with the Nazis, that their legal system has you guilty until proven innocent, that their National Front is thriving, that you have to choose your child's name from a state-approved list, that door-to-door political campaigning is illegal, that their bloody fingers had to be prised off their empire a good two decades after we'd given up ours with a wistful smile, that their spooks blow up unarmed Greenpeace ships and then get a hero's welcome, and that women didn't get the vote until 1945 and still rarely make it in politics unless they've slept with the president. Ah, but they had a revolution a zillion trillion years ago, so they must be really sound!</p> <p>But the French can't help the way they are, of course - and it occurs to me that I actually dislike English people who bang on about the glories of France much more than I hate the French themselves. It's like boxing - it's the brainless trash in the front row baying for blood who are objectionable, not the poor lunks themselves. And the same with fox-hunting - hunters, like naughty Mr Fox, are vermin and born to kill for fun, but those people who can do joined-up writing and use it to send letters of support for their more cranially-challenged brothers are the real danger.</p> <p>I think that the only British people left who like the French tend to be men between the ages of 45 and 65 - the Rancid Years - and I bet you any money that a good many of them like the idea of it so much because they've grown up with the old line that every married Frenchman has a \"mistress\" and the wife just puts up with it. (For some reason this is meant to be \"liberated\", though curiously it ties in exactly with the Victorian English way of looking at sex.) I've never been able to work out how exactly this would be physically possible, unless there were literally twice as many women as men in France, which seems unlikely considering their, ahem, war record - I mean, it wasn't exactly the Eastern Front down the Bois de Boulogne. Unless all the \"mistresses\", of course, are someone else's wives - ooohh, doesn't sound quite such a good set-up to you suddenly, does it?</p> <p>And I would bet you any money that a good number of these fading Francophiles read a magazine called the Erotic Review, and buy dirty pictures from its sister set-up, the Erotic Print Society. I have for a long time been intrigued by the sheer, off-the-scale naffness of these organs, an annoyance that was admittedly piqued when they asked me to write for them and I was forced to admit to myself that 20 years of me banging on in public about how much I hated the word \"erotic\" above all others had been as naught.</p> <p> Erotic; go on, isn't that the naffest, weasliest, most Hyacinth Bucketish word of all time? And so up itself! You are a tourist - I am a traveller. You are a sad wanker who buys Big And Busty off the top shelf; I am an erotic gourmand who gets sent prints of strangers' tits in a plain brown wrapper. And might just accidentally knock one off before breakfast, but hey, that's not the point.</p> <p>So I've always examined their ads - always in \"classy\" publications such as the Sunday Times - with some fascination, wondering how it could ever get worse. Well, the current one could never be surpassed, believe me; \"This month, you'll find out, if you're not completely sure already, what women want, from Karen Krizanovich, Lizzie Speller and harems of other fun-loving females. Then you can decide whether to provide for them or not. TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE NOW with the Erotic Print Society catalogue and your free Review.\"</p> <p>I honestly believe I've never read such a sad, stunted, bleak view of human sexuality anywhere, including toilet walls. Harems of fun-loving females! Hacks who've been paid to make fools of themselves. You can decide whether to provide for them or not! Hello? And excuse me, but exactly how is it \"taking control\" to furtively masturbate over a photo of a woman who wouldn't look twice on you while your wife - who gave up shagging you three years ago because it was so boring - slumbers on in the sleep of the just?</p> <p>Hmm . . . I don't know who the average Erotic Review reader is, but I bet he drinks Le Piat D'Or.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I was really pleased to see this week that that horrible swill Le Piat D'Or - which, I blush to say, my first husband often impressed me with when I was a green young teen - is to be re-launched and re-branded, so dire have its sales been recently; down by \u00a310m since the 80s. Out go those annoying ads of the silly, chic French couple getting dressed while the rude, early guests wait at the door bearing a bottle of it, as if that was the answer to everything! Out goes the line \"Les Fran\u00e7ais adorent le Piat D'Or.\" The reason? \"France and the French are no longer aspirational,\" says Emma Chamberlain, the drink's marketing manager. Apparently your average winey would rather have a beaker of the warm Antipodes, and I'm not surprised. With wine, as with no other drink, the aspirational and lifestyle sway is high, and it seems quite understandable that a modern, friendly, sunny country like Oz would be more on our mind when we kicked back with a glass of the grape on yet another freezing spring evening than the thought of crumbly, snooty old Paree, where there's just as much rain and twice as much dog muck. Hopefully we've seen the back of what that Czech intellectual refugee - dazzled by the liberty and culture of postwar Britain, amazed that our chattering classes were so in thrall to the French - named in the 50s as \"French flu\". Because it's certainly been with us until extremely recently. Ah, the French! Never mind that they collaborated with the Nazis, that their legal system has you guilty until proven innocent, that their National Front is thriving, that you have to choose your child's name from a state-approved list, that door-to-door political campaigning is illegal, that their bloody fingers had to be prised off their empire a good two decades after we'd given up ours with a wistful smile, that their spooks blow up unarmed Greenpeace ships and then get a hero's welcome, and that women didn't get the vote until 1945 and still rarely make it in politics unless they've slept with the president. Ah, but they had a revolution a zillion trillion years ago, so they must be really sound! But the French can't help the way they are, of course - and it occurs to me that I actually dislike English people who bang on about the glories of France much more than I hate the French themselves. It's like boxing - it's the brainless trash in the front row baying for blood who are objectionable, not the poor lunks themselves. And the same with fox-hunting - hunters, like naughty Mr Fox, are vermin and born to kill for fun, but those people who can do joined-up writing and use it to send letters of support for their more cranially-challenged brothers are the real danger. I think that the only British people left who like the French tend to be men between the ages of 45 and 65 - the Rancid Years - and I bet you any money that a good many of them like the idea of it so much because they've grown up with the old line that every married Frenchman has a \"mistress\" and the wife just puts up with it. (For some reason this is meant to be \"liberated\", though curiously it ties in exactly with the Victorian English way of looking at sex.) I've never been able to work out how exactly this would be physically possible, unless there were literally twice as many women as men in France, which seems unlikely considering their, ahem, war record - I mean, it wasn't exactly the Eastern Front down the Bois de Boulogne. Unless all the \"mistresses\", of course, are someone else's wives - ooohh, doesn't sound quite such a good set-up to you suddenly, does it? And I would bet you any money that a good number of these fading Francophiles read a magazine called the Erotic Review, and buy dirty pictures from its sister set-up, the Erotic Print Society. I have for a long time been intrigued by the sheer, off-the-scale naffness of these organs, an annoyance that was admittedly piqued when they asked me to write for them and I was forced to admit to myself that 20 years of me banging on in public about how much I hated the word \"erotic\" above all others had been as naught. Erotic; go on, isn't that the naffest, weasliest, most Hyacinth Bucketish word of all time? And so up itself! You are a tourist - I am a traveller. You are a sad wanker who buys Big And Busty off the top shelf; I am an erotic gourmand who gets sent prints of strangers' tits in a plain brown wrapper. And might just accidentally knock one off before breakfast, but hey, that's not the point. So I've always examined their ads - always in \"classy\" publications such as the Sunday Times - with some fascination, wondering how it could ever get worse. Well, the current one could never be surpassed, believe me; \"This month, you'll find out, if you're not completely sure already, what women want, from Karen Krizanovich, Lizzie Speller and harems of other fun-loving females. Then you can decide whether to provide for them or not. TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE NOW with the Erotic Print Society catalogue and your free Review.\" I honestly believe I've never read such a sad, stunted, bleak view of human sexuality anywhere, including toilet walls. Harems of fun-loving females! Hacks who've been paid to make fools of themselves. You can decide whether to provide for them or not! Hello? And excuse me, but exactly how is it \"taking control\" to furtively masturbate over a photo of a woman who wouldn't look twice on you while your wife - who gave up shagging you three years ago because it was so boring - slumbers on in the sleep of the just? Hmm . . . I don't know who the average Erotic Review reader is, but I bet he drinks Le Piat D'Or.",

Prince Strozzi, host to the Blairs for the past three years, would gladly have them to stay again.

That's for sure.\" But then the prince may have misjudged his man. It may seem obvious to a rich, hereditary Italian nobleman, unanswerable to any electorate and planning to support the right in next month's Italian general election, that a British Labour prime minister should holiday in Blackpool this year, but it may not seem so obvious to the prime minister himself. For while Blair dithers about lots of things and allows focus groups to determine many of his decisions, he is a man of steel on the question of holidays.</p> <p>I admire him for it. When it comes to his private life - where he spends his holidays, where he sends his children to school - Blair is indifferent to public opinion. These matters are nobody's business but his own and his family's, he insists. He would never sink, like Bill and Hillary Clinton, to going on a miserable camping holiday in the Rocky Mountains just because an opinion poll said that this was what a majority of the electorate wanted them to do. </p> <p>So it is just conceivable that the Blairs could still be hanging out with the Strozzis in Tuscany this summer. The prince will be surprised to see them there, for he knows the British electorate won't approve. But he is familiar with the prime minister's sturdy independence of mind about such things, which is possibly why he expressed the view in his interview that Blair is \"in many ways, a bit of a Thatcherite\".</p> <p>Personally, I will not be diverted from going to Tuscany this August. I don't like it much in Britain at the moment, especially with the animal holocaust going on. I am not one of those optimists, who, according to new RAC findings, wilfully misinterpret road signs to mean something nice. I don't think that a sign displaying a wind-sock means \"kite-flying area\", or that one of a toad means there is a French restaurant ahead. I see things in a gloomier perspective.</p> <p> Another good reason for going to Tuscany is the food. I want to get away for a bit from our new national dish, chicken tikka masala, which Robin Cook says perfectly illustrates \"the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences\". Marmalade does that, too, being composed almost entirely of non-indigenous ingredients, but the importance of chicken tikka masala as a symbol of multiculturalism is that its origins are Asian. This makes it a handy weapon for using against \"racists\". You might just as well say that spaghetti or pizza are British national dishes.</p> <p>In this sterile, dishonest argument about racism between Labour and the Tories, we should recognise and accept a few of the obvious facts. One is that, while Robin Cook is right in saying that the British never have been a \"race\" but have always constituted an amalgam of races, our sense of nationhood until recently was built principally around a shared belief in our cultural superiority over other peoples (Italians being one of them). Now that we can no longer get away with such claims, we have to base our national identity on something else. The logical step would be to follow the example of the world's most successful immigrant nation, the United States, and base it on loyalty to the constitution and to the flag. </p> <p>So why does a Labour MP like Peter Bradley contemptuously accuse the Tories of \"wrapping themselves in the flag\", as if it were a racist thing to do?

      "body": "<b>Will spinning make my legs bulky?</b> <br> This is a question women often ask, and also a common misconception. The answer is no. Spinning - high-energy classes on static bikes - will not make your legs look bigger. In order to provoke the human growth hormone, you must work against high resistance measured roughly by the performance of 8-12 repetitions. In an endurance-based exercise such as spinning, or indeed long-distance running, when you are carrying out numerous repetitions, your legs will not increase in muscle size or bulk. Hence the difference in build between a sprinter and a long-distance runner. The sprinter is muscle bound (power-based training), the long-distance athlete is slim (endurance-based training). <p><b>I get cramp very easily: what is the cause and what can I do to avoid it? </b><br> Cramp can be caused by either dehydration, lack of body salt (sodium), or both. Sodium is required for nerve and muscle action and is also required to ingest water. Water, however, is lost during prolonged exercise (as sweat) and takes with it sodium. To avoid cramp, aim to remain hydrated at all times. To relieve it, try light stretching and manipulation of the affected muscle.</p> <p>Chris St George is fitness director of The Third Space in London, 020-7439 7333.

Spinning - high-energy classes on static bikes - will not make your legs look bigger. In order to provoke the human growth hormone, you must work against high resistance measured roughly by the performance of 8-12 repetitions. In an endurance-based exercise such as spinning, or indeed long-distance running, when you are carrying out numerous repetitions, your legs will not increase in muscle size or bulk. Hence the difference in build between a sprinter and a long-distance runner. The sprinter is muscle bound (power-based training), the long-distance athlete is slim (endurance-based training). I get cramp very easily: what is the cause and what can I do to avoid it? Cramp can be caused by either dehydration, lack of body salt (sodium), or both. Sodium is required for nerve and muscle action and is also required to ingest water. Water, however, is lost during prolonged exercise (as sweat) and takes with it sodium. To avoid cramp, aim to remain hydrated at all times. To relieve it, try light stretching and manipulation of the affected muscle.

      "body": "<p>When the actor David Arquette was recently reported to have consulted a hypnotherapist to stop his dog snoring, it was hard not to snigger. But this was not the behaviour of some self-obsessed Hollywood celeb that it at first seemed, for we are now embracing alternative therapies for our pets as eagerly as for ourselves. Herbal remedies for rabbits, Bach flower remedies for dogs, therapeutic touch for cats, Ayurvedic medicine for horses: someone out there is offering it.</p> <p>They're not all new-age practitioners, either. Many vets are taking a fresh look at ways of healing, too. At his Oxfordshire clinic, Christopher Day uses a range of alternative treatments as a first measure, reserving drugs and surgery only for what, he says, are those rare occasions when they're really needed. Susan and Martyn Bittleston went to him after their usual vet suggested putting down their Ridgeback dog, Millie. \"She lost the use of her back legs suddenly for no apparent reason,\" says Susan. \"After examining her, Day gave her acupuncture: 11 needles down her spine and one in her forehead. He used a laser to stimulate points on her feet. It didn't cause her any distress. She just lay there, very relaxed. After the second session, a week later, she could stand. And after the next, she started walking for the first time in six weeks.\"</p> <p>For much the same reasons as Day, London vet David Boersma added homeopathy to his repertoire last year. \"I was no longer happy using conventional medicine alone - there were cases I just couldn't treat.

      "bodyText": "When the actor David Arquette was recently reported to have consulted a hypnotherapist to stop his dog snoring, it was hard not to snigger. But this was not the behaviour of some self-obsessed Hollywood celeb that it at first seemed, for we are now embracing alternative therapies for our pets as eagerly as for ourselves. Herbal remedies for rabbits, Bach flower remedies for dogs, therapeutic touch for cats, Ayurvedic medicine for horses: someone out there is offering it. They're not all new-age practitioners, either. Many vets are taking a fresh look at ways of healing, too. At his Oxfordshire clinic, Christopher Day uses a range of alternative treatments as a first measure, reserving drugs and surgery only for what, he says, are those rare occasions when they're really needed. Susan and Martyn Bittleston went to him after their usual vet suggested putting down their Ridgeback dog, Millie. \"She lost the use of her back legs suddenly for no apparent reason,\" says Susan. \"After examining her, Day gave her acupuncture: 11 needles down her spine and one in her forehead. He used a laser to stimulate points on her feet. It didn't cause her any distress. She just lay there, very relaxed. After the second session, a week later, she could stand. And after the next, she started walking for the first time in six weeks.\" For much the same reasons as Day, London vet David Boersma added homeopathy to his repertoire last year. \"I was no longer happy using conventional medicine alone - there were cases I just couldn't treat. I saw animals with cancer deteriorating more rapidly after chemotherapy and surgery than after alternative therapies. Now I give clients the option of trying a homeopathic remedy.\" The British Veterinary Association now considers alternative medicine as \"another weapon in the veterinary surgeon's armoury\", says a spokeswoman, while Tory MP David Tredinnick went so far as to suggest adopting alternative tactics in the battle against foot and mouth: \"If homeopathy is good for humans,\" he told parliament earlier this month, \"it is good for animals.\" With such rousing endorsements, it is hardly surprising that alternative therapies for pets now mirror developments in mainstream human medicine.

      "body": "<p><strong>Do I need planning permission?</strong></p> <p>That depends upon what kind of conservatory you're after. Building regulations state that conservatories are exempt if built onto domestic dwellings, separated by a door (so that's your open-plan space out, I'm afraid) and if they increase the building's floor space by no more than 30 sq metres (which is big enough to sit and enjoy the garden, but not big enough for that eight-seater glass dining table you've been dreaming of). If you've already had an extension the council may decide you've done enough. You may also run into trouble if you live in a conservation area. The good news is that if you're having your conservatory built for you, then sorting all the red tape is the builder's responsibility. </p> <p><strong> What should my conservatory be made of?</strong></p> <p>There are three main materials: timber, aluminium or uPVC (that's plastic to you and me). Timber and aluminium are the most expensive, and which you choose comes down to personal taste. Timber is flexible, so if you want mouldings and twiddley bits to fit in with your period house it's probably the best choice, although you'll have to look after the paintwork if you want it to last. Aluminium is light on maintenance (other than an annual wash) but it is uncompromisingly modern, so you - or your council - may not think it suits your house. uPVC is cheap and low maintenance, but it is noisy and can yellow with age. </p> <p><strong> What are the building options?</strong></p> <p>Again, you have three choices: the cheapest is a self-assembly kit available from most DIY stores, but you do need to be fairly competent - are you really up to dealing with foundations and brick laying? If not, then you can buy a conservatory from a stock design built to order, or, if you have a large enough budget, you can commission a bespoke number. Always check that the site you have chosen is suitable (and check sun and wind directions). A level, damp-proof and insulated base is essential. </p> <p><strong> What about the glass?</strong></p> <p>What you choose depends on your priorities. Toughened glass is quiet, but it shatters if anything - or anyone - crashes into it. Laminated glass provides more soundproofing and is safer because it breaks in one piece. If you plan to use your conservatory all year round, you will need double glazing. </p> <p><strong> What about the roof?</strong></p> <p>Choose between glass, which is translucent but heavy, so is unsuitable for some structures, or polycarbonate, which is light and strong but only semi-translucent. </p> <p><strong> How much will it cost?</strong></p> <p>How much have you got? You can set your budget and find a conservatory to fit. But as a guide, a 4m x 4m bespoke timber conservatory will set you back around \u00a330,000 (including building costs), while a home-constructed uPVC one can be bought for less than \u00a33,000. </p> <p><strong> How do I regulate the temperature? </strong></p> <p>If you're freezing in the winter and frying in the summer, then you've got something wrong. Double glazing and central heating (which must be able to be switched off if the conservatory is attached to the house) will deal with winter chills, and manual or automatic roof vents will keep the heat down in the summer. Light-reflecting, bronzed glass or blinds will also help to keep the sun out. </p> <p><strong> What about lighting?</strong></p> <p>Lighting is very important (natural light is fabulous, of course, but a bit limited at night), and you need to think about it at the start of the building process rather than the end. If you're planning to fix lights to the rafters, then the channels for the wires need to be cut at the factory. Also, think about lighting the garden: at night, a lit conservatory will just reflect the blackness outside, but a well-lit garden will add depth and interest to your new room. </p> <p><strong> And what if I want the look but I don't have any space to spare?</strong></p> <p>No problem.

      "bodyText": "'You know what? We are going to get you thin,\" Roly whispers conspiratorially as I huff and puff up the treadmill that he has rashly set on an incline today. He wants to increase my workload but, come on, 1%, that\u00d5s going it a bit, isn\u00d5t it? \"I don\u00d5t want to get thin,\" I insist. \"The aim was to get fit, and even that\u00d5s debatable now if it\u00d5s going to prove this torturous, but thin was never in my sights.\" \"No, we are going to get you thin, trust me,\" Roly beams back, clearly not able to compute a sentence containing the words not, want and thin. \"Sorry, Roly,\" and I do feel sorry because by now, week two, I worship him and really wish I could be what he wants me to want to be. In a swift seven days I\u00d5ve gone from stroppy teenager to prefect straight out of Swot High. I\u00d5m thinking of bringing him an apple next week (What\u00d5s that, about 80 calories if it\u00d5s a big one? And it\u00d5d have to be for my Roly). But my defiant nature prevails \u00d1 I do not want to be thin. There is no \"real\" me inside, struggling to squeeze out past all that flesh. This body, saddle bags, stomach rolls and all, is the \"real\" me. And the \"real\" me just wants to be able to open a jar of macadamia nuts without breaking into a sweat, okay? But as I limp along, I find myself brooding on my mentor\u00d5s words \u00d1 \"We are going to get you thin!\" If there was any hope of a \"we\" getting me thin, then I might give it a whirl. If a \"we\" could come round my house, cook me low-fat, high-fibre, nutritious meals every day, then come on you \"we-s\". But, of course, there is no \"we\". Roly can \"we\" all he likes. He can afford to \"we\" until he\u00d5s blue in the face because there\u00d5s only a \"me\" hoicking myself up the treadmill as far as I can see.

The naked body of Rebecca Hall, 19, mother of a four-month-old son, was found in an alley in the city's red light district on Thursday. She may have lain there for three days. Ms Hall, known to friends as Goofy because of her protruding front teeth, died as a result of severe head injuries. She was last seen on the night of Good Friday when she left her home in the Little Horton area to go to work. 'Her body was exposed to the elements and there were items of clothing nearby,' said Detective Chief Superintendent Max McLean. 'We are anxious to know what happened to her in the days before her body was found. It is important that people who know her, or have seen her since Easter, get in touch.' Detectives have been unable to establish a motive for the killing. Ms Hall, one of five sisters, was described as 5ft 5in tall and of a slim build. Her dyed red hair was cut in a bob style. When last seen she was wearing black leggings and a purple see-through top. Her son Jordan is being cared for by his grandmother.",

      "body": "<p>King George VI declared the Royal Festival Hall open on May 3, 1951. Sadly, a number of VIPs attending the event - including Gerald Barry, director general of the Festival of Britain, and the Lord Mayor of London - missed His Majesty's declaration: they were stuck in a lift inside Britain's first major post-war public building. Embarrassing that; yet in the 50 years since, the Royal Festival Hall - the \"people's palace\" - has been one of the most trouble-free and best-liked modern buildings in Britain. </p> <p>Intellectually rigorous, elegant, impeccably built and open to all comers, the hall was and remains a triumph of democratic public design. It introduced the British public to a form of modern architecture that had been brewing since soon after the first world war, in Germany, France and the Soviet Union, but arrived here late and generally unappreciated. Although in many ways original, the RFH owed its pedigree to the radical architecture of early Soviet architects as much as it did to the less strident Scandinavian modernism that must have seemed so attractive to the hall's young British architects. </p> <p>Those architects included Robert Matthew, Leslie Martin, Peter Moro and Edwin Williams. When the new concert hall was commissioned from the London County Council architects' department in September 1948, most of the design team, led by Matthew, were under 40. They produced what Wagner would have called a Gesamkunstwerk - a complete artwork. Although not quite completed when opened as the heart of the Festival of Britain, the building brought together the very best talents the nation had to offer. </p> <p>Its foyers were light and generous, reflections of the Thames rippling from its whiter-than-white ceilings on sunny days. (It rained and rained throughout the Festival of Britain.) The 3,165-seat auditorium was raised on stilts inside the generous volume of the stone-clad structure, so that it sat, as Martin said, like an \"egg in a box\". This was a stroke of genius - and it still surprises. Because you can see from one side of the RFH to the other, through big windows, the auditorium appears to have done a runner. In fact, it's up above you, a surprise of warm wood, swallow-nest boxes and plush seats. It has a magnificent organ designed by Ralph Downes . . . all 10,000 tons of it. Lined in double concrete walls to keep the noise of trains crossing Hungerford Bridge at bay, it is as \"rich and as sensual\", according to its architects, \"as 1951 would allow an interior\". </p> <p>The reason for placing the auditorium above the foyers was not to show how clever the architects were but to solve a very basic problem: although situated on a magnificent bend on the River Thames, the site itself was tight, hemmed in on one side by Hungerford railway bridge and on the other by what was scheduled to become the Royal National Theatre. The solution? Build upwards so as to maximise public circulation space in the building. </p> <p>\"We have taken a cube of space roughly 200ft square and 80ft high,\" wrote Martin at the time. \"Within this space we have modelled and sculpted out the shape of the component parts and, as you move through the foyers and promenades, if you are aware of the excitement of its vistas and its continual unfolding of space, we shall not have failed.\" They haven't. </p> <p>For all its cool, rational logic, the RFH weaves a quiet magic on the 3m people who pass through its unpretentious portals each year (the numbers increased dramatically from 1983 when the foyer doors were thrown open all day). </p> <p>The real wonder, though, is that it was built at all. In 1948, with Britain worn out by war, the only buildings approved for capital expenditure were homes, schools and factories. The RFH went ahead, however, with a budget of \u00a32m (it came in less than 1% over budget), with Herbert Morrison, Lord President of Council and former leader of the London County Council acting as its guardian angel. In the event, the RFH took just 20 months to build, a remarkably short time given the constraints of the time and the radical nature of its design. </p> <p>The RFH meant a great deal to the music world and to concert-goers who had been denied a major, purpose-built concert hall since 1941, when the Queen's Hall was burned out by a German incendiary bomb. The Royal Albert Hall, with its then decidedly dodgy acoustics, had always been a multi-purpose venue, for boxing as well as Beethoven. </p> <p>Sir Malcolm Sargent was the musical advisor to the RFH and every attempt was made to create what might be described as a democratic acoustic. The aim was a sound that was equal and consistent when heard from any seat in the auditorium. This meant, in theory, that every seat could be sold at the same price - although in practice this has never been the case. </p> <p>The stage was designed to optimise orchestral acoustics, so percussion and brass sections were sited on a concrete floor and the rest of the orchestra on timber. The reverberation time was intended to be 2.2 seconds (slightly warm) but ended up a rather cold 1.5. (A medieval cathedral, with its rich, echoing sound, is normally about 11 seconds.) </p> <p>Yet, musically as well as architecturally, the RFH was judged a critical and popular success.The acoustic was praised by conductors and orchestras at the time for its \"modern\" crispness; today, a warmer sound is appreciated and the auditorium is to be subtly tuned as far as this is possible. Every last detail was intended to be the newest and the best. </p> <p>Aside from the care that went into its musical properties, the RFH was a showcase of modern design - furniture by Robin Day, a distinctive bat-and-ball carpet by Peter Moro, who had worked on the De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill-on-Sea, which was, in its much smaller way, a prototype for the RFH. The British public would have seen little to match it in modern intent, except, of course, for the stations, rolling stock and buses of Frank Pick's London Underground, much admired by Matthew, Martin, Moro and co, and made possible with the earlier political machinations of Herbert Morrison. </p> <p>But . . . the RFH was never quite complete. Its backstage facilities were derisory and the face it presented to the Thames was a little grim, and temporary. In June 1964, the building was closed for eight months for a facelift. The big smile of its Thames-side elevation dates from this time. </p> <p>Ever since, the RFH has been cluttered up inside, then stripped back a bit, then messed up again. Only recently has a considered, long-term plan been put into practice, with the architects Allies and Morrison commissioned to work through the building to both renovate and improve. Two of the practice's architects working on the RFH, Graham Morrison and Di Haig, were trained by Martin when he was professor of architecture at Cambridge. The new works, quiet and respectful, and due for completion in 2003/4, include a new recital room, the opening up of the garden roof terraces for the first time in many years, new bars and cafes extending on to terraces, new backstage areas and a general architectural wash- and brush-up. A slim new office will rise alongside Hungerford Bridge to house RFH and other South Bank Centre staff. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the whole of the South Bank is being replanned under the direction of Rick Mather. A landscape architect is to be appointed in May after the RFH's 50th birthday celebrations and one of either Rafael Vignoly or FOA (Foreign Office Architects - just a name, and nothing to do with government wallahs) will be offered the commission to design a new arts building on the Jubilee Gardens site on the other side of Hungerford Bridge from the RFH. This was where the principal buildings of the 1951 Festival of Britain stood, including Powell &amp; Moya's Skylon and Ralph Tubbs's Dome of Discovery. </p> <p>Fifty years young, the Royal Festival Hall remains an evolving showcase of open, accessible, democratic architecture.

A diligent professional to the last, he (or she) will throw himself into each role without a shred of concern for his physical or creative limitations, not to mention sanity. </p> <p>It's no picnic, though. Recently, for example, Nicolas Cage has been telling anyone who'll listen about the hell he went through to learn the mandolin for his role as Captain Corelli. Poor lamb.</p> <p>Meanwhile, his co-star Christian Bale had to learn how to throw a shing net like a real 40s Greek sherman. Not as simple as it might sound, since local shermen all disagreed over what was the authentic method.</p> <p>You may ask, \"Who the hell would have noticed he was throwing it the wrong way - apart from a few \"experts\" on 40s Greek shing methods, who don't know for denite either?\"</p> <p>That's the wrong attitude. If a job's worth doing, it's worth doing properly. Besides, that kind of realism-at-all-costs approach to acting can be a richly rewarding experience. The role may be demanding, but you get to learn important new life skills.</p> <p>As an actor at the top of your trade, you've got to be prepared for anything. Picture the scene: your role, should you choose to accept it, is a chess grandmaster with a black belt in jujitsu. What do you do?

      "bodyText": "The modern Hollywood actor is a proud creature. A diligent professional to the last, he (or she) will throw himself into each role without a shred of concern for his physical or creative limitations, not to mention sanity. It's no picnic, though. Recently, for example, Nicolas Cage has been telling anyone who'll listen about the hell he went through to learn the mandolin for his role as Captain Corelli. Poor lamb. Meanwhile, his co-star Christian Bale had to learn how to throw a shing net like a real 40s Greek sherman. Not as simple as it might sound, since local shermen all disagreed over what was the authentic method. You may ask, \"Who the hell would have noticed he was throwing it the wrong way - apart from a few \"experts\" on 40s Greek shing methods, who don't know for denite either?\" That's the wrong attitude. If a job's worth doing, it's worth doing properly. Besides, that kind of realism-at-all-costs approach to acting can be a richly rewarding experience. The role may be demanding, but you get to learn important new life skills. As an actor at the top of your trade, you've got to be prepared for anything. Picture the scene: your role, should you choose to accept it, is a chess grandmaster with a black belt in jujitsu. What do you do? Just pretend? \"Heavens, no!\" says any actor worth his equity card. \"I couldn't possibly bring myself to fake it, I shall spend the next two years locked away perfecting both those skills!

And Thomas Lynch, poet, undertaker, and, with the publication of his previous collection of musings, The Undertaking , renowned essayist, obliges here with \"Fish Stories\". His four-year-old had caught his first fish, and was torn between the desire to take it home to show his mother - which would, of course, asphyxiate it - and to let it live by throwing it back. He put it back, in tears: \"Catch and release, like love and grief, are difficult notions. We've been fishing together ever since.\" </p> <p>Lynch, at least, knows one possible reaction to this: \"I know you're thinking that's cute enough to make you puke\" - which, funnily enough, was exactly what I was thinking. But it was nice of him to give us permission to throw up, nodding to the decadent and cynical tendencies of the old-world Anglo-Saxon mind, even if he nevertheless carries on in exactly the same manner as before. </p> <p>One must forgive him his cornball tendencies. They are, after all, an important - and, it would appear, sustaining - part of him. And he needs sustaining, one suspects. At one point, wrangling over the conspicuous failure of the Almighty to even begin to acknowledge the most modest supplication, he decides that prayer should not be a wish list but a matter of saying \"thank you\" to God: \"Every day, every time, never fails, if I just say 'thanks' I'll get the answer, before the darkness comes - 'You're welcome,' it says. 'You're welcome.'\" That, too, might seem emetic, but only out of context: it comes at the end of a 21-page dissertation on his son's, and his own, alcoholism. Aren't these Americans candid? </p> <p>Essayists are meant to know all the answers, even if one of them is \"I do not know all the answers\". As an undertaker, Lynch stares the imponderable in the face day to day, and you can imagine that it is a comfort to many that the man charged with interring their loved ones should have worked out a way of talking to God that leaves him satisfied. He has been well prepared by his Catholic education, which would appear to be one of the few instances where \"educated by nuns\" does not mean \"thrashed by nuns\". </p> <p>Perversely I do not seem to be leaving you with many reasons for reading this book. It not only repeats itself, but it repeats The Undertaking . There appears to be no sentiment so trite that he blushes to air it. Reflections on the close relationship between sex and death, for instance, or this: \"Astronauts return from space convinced of the glory and grandeur of Creation. It is no less so when one witnesses nativity first hand, or looks into the void of death.\" (The first point seems fair enough. The other two are, I would venture, matters of opinion to say the very least. Birth makes a frightful mess of the sheets; and what was it Joyce - of whom Lynch knows full well - called God? The insatiable chewer of corpses, or something like.) </p> <p>Look on this as a belated tribute to The Undertaking , the superior book. Besides, it is pleasant to read an uncynical voice, for once. Yet anyone who is driven to seriously contemplate the murder of his cat (I love cats but he makes a very good case for his position), or sends his bad poems off to magazines under the names of poets he dislikes, can't be a total goody two-shoes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bodies in Motion and at Rest Thomas Lynch (Vintage, \u00a37.99) Buy it at a discount at BOL The male American essayist finds it incumbent on himself to produce at least one piece about fishing with a son. And Thomas Lynch, poet, undertaker, and, with the publication of his previous collection of musings, The Undertaking , renowned essayist, obliges here with \"Fish Stories\". His four-year-old had caught his first fish, and was torn between the desire to take it home to show his mother - which would, of course, asphyxiate it - and to let it live by throwing it back. He put it back, in tears: \"Catch and release, like love and grief, are difficult notions. We've been fishing together ever since.\" Lynch, at least, knows one possible reaction to this: \"I know you're thinking that's cute enough to make you puke\" - which, funnily enough, was exactly what I was thinking. But it was nice of him to give us permission to throw up, nodding to the decadent and cynical tendencies of the old-world Anglo-Saxon mind, even if he nevertheless carries on in exactly the same manner as before. One must forgive him his cornball tendencies. They are, after all, an important - and, it would appear, sustaining - part of him. And he needs sustaining, one suspects. At one point, wrangling over the conspicuous failure of the Almighty to even begin to acknowledge the most modest supplication, he decides that prayer should not be a wish list but a matter of saying \"thank you\" to God: \"Every day, every time, never fails, if I just say 'thanks' I'll get the answer, before the darkness comes - 'You're welcome,' it says. 'You're welcome.'\" That, too, might seem emetic, but only out of context: it comes at the end of a 21-page dissertation on his son's, and his own, alcoholism. Aren't these Americans candid? Essayists are meant to know all the answers, even if one of them is \"I do not know all the answers\". As an undertaker, Lynch stares the imponderable in the face day to day, and you can imagine that it is a comfort to many that the man charged with interring their loved ones should have worked out a way of talking to God that leaves him satisfied. He has been well prepared by his Catholic education, which would appear to be one of the few instances where \"educated by nuns\" does not mean \"thrashed by nuns\". Perversely I do not seem to be leaving you with many reasons for reading this book. It not only repeats itself, but it repeats The Undertaking . There appears to be no sentiment so trite that he blushes to air it. Reflections on the close relationship between sex and death, for instance, or this: \"Astronauts return from space convinced of the glory and grandeur of Creation. It is no less so when one witnesses nativity first hand, or looks into the void of death.\" (The first point seems fair enough. The other two are, I would venture, matters of opinion to say the very least. Birth makes a frightful mess of the sheets; and what was it Joyce - of whom Lynch knows full well - called God? The insatiable chewer of corpses, or something like.) Look on this as a belated tribute to The Undertaking , the superior book. Besides, it is pleasant to read an uncynical voice, for once. Yet anyone who is driven to seriously contemplate the murder of his cat (I love cats but he makes a very good case for his position), or sends his bad poems off to magazines under the names of poets he dislikes, can't be a total goody two-shoes.",

In Britain in particular, where the prevailing fictional mode remains 19th-century realism, the shelves are filled with books as thick as bricks, and as pigshit. Only the rare writer - one possessed of the wit and great good sense, say, of a Jonathan Coe, or the sheer mad stamina of a Lawrence Norfolk or a Barbara Taylor Bradford - can pull off the successful big book. The rest are destined to be remaindered before the epilogue is drying in the laser printer's output tray. </p> <p>Thank goodness, then, that short books are back in vogue. And that's short books, note, rather than small. Short and small do not necessarily go together: a good Bible should ideally fit into the pocket of a cassock or a pair of combat trousers, or a small tooled-leather carrying case. Even the Observer Pocket Series, undoubtedly the most toothsome and exquisite series of small books ever produced in the English language - no larger than a bar of Kendal Mint Cake and to the adolescent male just as sweet - were never exactly short. Some of them ran to hundreds of pages. </p> <p>At the point-of-sale in a bookshop you might currently find a Little Book or two, of Calm, or Text Messaging, or Trepanning, all small enough to fit in the palm of your hand or under the leg of a wobbly table. Some publishers have even started to produce books that are small and short and cheap and good. For the price of a tortilla wrap and a decaf cappuccino you could purchase a Canongate Pocket Canon, one of the Penguin 60s or a little bit of the LRB , courtesy of Profile Books, and keep it in your lunchbox. Granta has begun a series of Granta Specials, too, with Ian Jack's dissection of Hatfield, The Crash that Stopped Britain . The Granta/LRB approach will be popular because many newspapers no longer give their journalists the time for in-depth features. We must have short books because we can't have long articles. </p> <p>A new publisher, the Short Book Company, set up by two ex-journalists, Rebecca Nicolson and Aurea Carpenter, now adds to this small pile of good things. The company's first set of publications is a series of mini-biographies called Short Lives. Not much bigger than a postcard and exactly 96 pages in length, each book can be read in under an hour and then either discarded or posted on to friends and family in parts of the country where the only books on sale are near the cheese counter in Tesco's. </p> <p>There are snapshot portraits of Carrie Kipling, the \"hated wife\" of Rudyard, and Commander John Kerans, \"last action hero of the British Empire\". To give you some idea of how short, small and readable they really are: Edward Fox's excellent baby-biog of Alexander Csoma de Koros, The Hungarian Who Walked to Heaven , took me exactly 56 minutes and 32 seconds. This included: one brief trip to the toilet (ground floor); a short break for refreshments (microwaved reheat of the remains of a four-cup cafeti\u00e8re of coffee); several moments staring out of the window as a troupe of Irish dancers in full fig arrived for a competition in the community hall across the road; half-listening to two screened phone calls; and the brief comforting of a crying child who'd accidentally hit himself with the plug on the end of the Hoover flex. Isn't this how most people read? </p> <p>I could of course right now tell you virtually nothing about Fox's life of the extraordinary de Koros, who may have been a Hungarian linguist and the compiler of one of the first Tibetan dictionaries. But I could be confusing Fox's short book with Rupert Christiansen's about Arthur Hugh Clough, the bottle-cap salesman and inventor of the disposable safety razor. Or Tim Dowling's about King Camp Gillette, the almost-famous Victorian poet. I shall have to read them all again. </p> <p>The Short Lives series, in other words, is excellent but also instantly forgettable, since that which you read quickly you soon forget. This is not helped by the fact that the subjects covered are all more than a little obscure - glorious, but obscure. The overlooked, it has to be said, are sometimes overlookable. </p> <p>This is not to deny the possible charm of the unconsidered, the minor or the minute. There are short books that represent a distillate or epitome, or act as an emblem; an exquisite novella such as Fred Uhlman's Reunion or a slim volume of verse by Michael Longley is clearly worth much more than its weight or cover price and certainly more than the latest prize-winning bit of puff. </p> <p>Most books, however, whatever their length, are trivial, trite, forgettable and perishable, and do not deserve lingering over for even 56 minutes and 32 seconds. A bad short book may therefore be better than a bad long book, since all of us read up against the clock, and we don't like to have our time wasted. Many of us have to read quickly under the necessity of acquiring information. For such purposes, publishers such as Butterworth's and Tolley, the tax and law people, provide an excellent service. A few of us read late at night and for the challenge. For this, and for helping to put us to sleep, we can thank Harvill, Picador and Faber. But most of us read merely for distraction, on the train or the toilet, for which passing pleasures we can thank the editors of the Sun , the Fortean Times , local newspapers, small-circulation poetry magazines and the Short Book Company. </p> <p>The space for Short Books is wide. Forthcoming joys include a series of reportage, Front Lines, and The History Files, books of narrative history for children. And there should surely be more Short Lives. A short book about the great Miss Frank Buttolph and her notorious menu history of New York, perhaps? Or about Edward Carpenter, the wealthy Victorian homosexual, anarchist, lecturer, writer, sandal-maker, market-gardener and author of the pioneering sex manual, Love's Coming of Age ? You may have suggestions of your own. Why not send your ideas to Ms Carpenter and Ms Nicolson? At least their slush pile will be smaller. </p> <p>The same people who hate CD samplers and Classic FM will probably hate Short Books and everything they stand for, but they'd be missing the point. There is undoubtedly a virtue in persisting, in revisiting, in the full symphony; in scope and length and depth and breadth. But there is also a wonder in concision: look at the microchip, for example, or the sayings of Oscar Wilde. Of course, to really make their point, Short Books should set up a sister company specialising in the three-volume page-monster. For there is no such thing as the average person. And there is no correct length for a book. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theshortbookco.com\">www.theshortbookco.com</a></p>",

For the price of a tortilla wrap and a decaf cappuccino you could purchase a Canongate Pocket Canon, one of the Penguin 60s or a little bit of the LRB , courtesy of Profile Books, and keep it in your lunchbox. Granta has begun a series of Granta Specials, too, with Ian Jack's dissection of Hatfield, The Crash that Stopped Britain . The Granta/LRB approach will be popular because many newspapers no longer give their journalists the time for in-depth features. We must have short books because we can't have long articles. A new publisher, the Short Book Company, set up by two ex-journalists, Rebecca Nicolson and Aurea Carpenter, now adds to this small pile of good things. The company's first set of publications is a series of mini-biographies called Short Lives. Not much bigger than a postcard and exactly 96 pages in length, each book can be read in under an hour and then either discarded or posted on to friends and family in parts of the country where the only books on sale are near the cheese counter in Tesco's. There are snapshot portraits of Carrie Kipling, the \"hated wife\" of Rudyard, and Commander John Kerans, \"last action hero of the British Empire\". To give you some idea of how short, small and readable they really are: Edward Fox's excellent baby-biog of Alexander Csoma de Koros, The Hungarian Who Walked to Heaven , took me exactly 56 minutes and 32 seconds. This included: one brief trip to the toilet (ground floor); a short break for refreshments (microwaved reheat of the remains of a four-cup cafeti\u00e8re of coffee); several moments staring out of the window as a troupe of Irish dancers in full fig arrived for a competition in the community hall across the road; half-listening to two screened phone calls; and the brief comforting of a crying child who'd accidentally hit himself with the plug on the end of the Hoover flex. Isn't this how most people read? I could of course right now tell you virtually nothing about Fox's life of the extraordinary de Koros, who may have been a Hungarian linguist and the compiler of one of the first Tibetan dictionaries. But I could be confusing Fox's short book with Rupert Christiansen's about Arthur Hugh Clough, the bottle-cap salesman and inventor of the disposable safety razor. Or Tim Dowling's about King Camp Gillette, the almost-famous Victorian poet. I shall have to read them all again. The Short Lives series, in other words, is excellent but also instantly forgettable, since that which you read quickly you soon forget. This is not helped by the fact that the subjects covered are all more than a little obscure - glorious, but obscure. The overlooked, it has to be said, are sometimes overlookable. This is not to deny the possible charm of the unconsidered, the minor or the minute. There are short books that represent a distillate or epitome, or act as an emblem; an exquisite novella such as Fred Uhlman's Reunion or a slim volume of verse by Michael Longley is clearly worth much more than its weight or cover price and certainly more than the latest prize-winning bit of puff. Most books, however, whatever their length, are trivial, trite, forgettable and perishable, and do not deserve lingering over for even 56 minutes and 32 seconds. A bad short book may therefore be better than a bad long book, since all of us read up against the clock, and we don't like to have our time wasted. Many of us have to read quickly under the necessity of acquiring information. For such purposes, publishers such as Butterworth's and Tolley, the tax and law people, provide an excellent service. A few of us read late at night and for the challenge. For this, and for helping to put us to sleep, we can thank Harvill, Picador and Faber. But most of us read merely for distraction, on the train or the toilet, for which passing pleasures we can thank the editors of the Sun , the Fortean Times , local newspapers, small-circulation poetry magazines and the Short Book Company. The space for Short Books is wide. Forthcoming joys include a series of reportage, Front Lines, and The History Files, books of narrative history for children. And there should surely be more Short Lives. A short book about the great Miss Frank Buttolph and her notorious menu history of New York, perhaps? Or about Edward Carpenter, the wealthy Victorian homosexual, anarchist, lecturer, writer, sandal-maker, market-gardener and author of the pioneering sex manual, Love's Coming of Age ? You may have suggestions of your own. Why not send your ideas to Ms Carpenter and Ms Nicolson? At least their slush pile will be smaller. The same people who hate CD samplers and Classic FM will probably hate Short Books and everything they stand for, but they'd be missing the point. There is undoubtedly a virtue in persisting, in revisiting, in the full symphony; in scope and length and depth and breadth. But there is also a wonder in concision: look at the microchip, for example, or the sayings of Oscar Wilde. Of course, to really make their point, Short Books should set up a sister company specialising in the three-volume page-monster. For there is no such thing as the average person. And there is no correct length for a book. www.theshortbookco.com",

The synopsis - English spinster responds to the death of her life-long companion by upping sticks and travelling to Venice - hardly seems to signal a bestseller. Yet Vickers manages to convey the rich potential of the unlived life - an idea that seems to have a powerful appeal to its author in both her art and her life. Before beginning to write her book three years ago, Vickers had been an academic and an analytical psychologist. Not for her the lingering regret of what might have been. She says the novel took nine months to write and 20 years to compose. But in fact her literary apprenticeship began much earlier. </p> <p>Vickers says her early vocabulary was expanded by Beatrix Potter, and when she got to school her syntax was stretched by Henry James. \"Potter would use a word like soporific and then, very tactfully, tell you what it meant,\" she explains. \"James's syntax looks quite complex at first, but if you listen to him then it makes absolute sense.\" </p> <p>By the time she was at university in the early 1970s she said she had, \"crushingly high standards\" in writing. \"The people I loved were Jane Austen, Conrad, James and Dostoevsky. I felt you had to be in that sort of range.

Her first major career move came when she left academia to become an analytical psychologist. \"I eventually thought that literature is not a very good academic subject,\" she explains. \"The great writers didn't write to be analysed, they wrote to entertain and to share a vision of human life. It's lovely to sit around drinking coffee and talking about books at Cambridge, but I sort of felt that English is a cheat subject.\" </p> <p>As a psychologist, Vickers jumped in at the emotional deep end, working with people with addictive disorders, and fathers in families where there had been unsubstantiated allegations of sexual abuse. She says an important aspect of this work was finding the corresponding experience within herself. \"The capacity to feel within the consciousness of another person has obviously been important to me as a writer.\" She now works with artists, writers and musicians: \"people with a block or anxiety about performance. People who feel for whatever reason they have come to a hitch in their life.\" But she says she has always believed in the importance of the creative arts. \"I think they are probably much more use to people than psychology is.\" </p> <p>Vickers had been a regular visitor to Venice ever since she first travelled there as an \"arrogant teenager who thought it would be awful and full of tourists. But as I walked from the station to Piazza San Marco I could feel my prejudices dropping away.\" She stumbled upon a church containing a series of paintings by the elder Guardi brother, telling the biblical story of Tobias and the angel. </p> <p>Despite searching for it on subsequent visits, she only found it again in 1998. \"I went straight back to my apartment and started to write Miss Garnett . It was like it had lain there dormant all these years waiting for me.\" </p> <p>Having been brought up in an atheist communist family (her grandmother, writing under the nom de plume of V Virens, had a play about an adulteress banned by the Lord Chamberlain before the first world war), Vickers say she always regarded religion as \"a mysterious and slightly forbidden area. But I do now think that human beings are not the measure of all things.\" In the novel, Julia Garnet dips into her past and finds it made strange by the swirl of mythology, psychology, religion and politics thrown up by the Venetian setting. Vickers says that as a psychologist she had sensed that people were \"increasingly fed up with the materialism, the consumerism, the violence in our culture\". </p> <p>\"I knew from talking to people at quite an intimate level that there is a longing for what I can only describe as traditional values, by which I mean in this case, art, the ancient story of Tobias and the angel, the paintings of Venice, even the character of my heroine. I thought if people could find these things they would enjoy them. People are bored with chick lit and men behaving badly; they want something more substantial.\" </p> <p>The book was given a huge pre-publication boost when the late Penelope Fitzgerald said of it: \"We think, well yes, we know the plot, but the book turns out to be subtle, unexpected and haunting in a way we certainly never guessed.\" It has since been serialised on Radio Four, and has steadily picked up readers. Vickers says: \"Some people were slightly misled by the simplicity of the style. In fact, it is a quite subversive story.\" </p> <p>Owing to a delay in publication, Vickers was able to write a second novel, published this autumn, in what she calls \"lovely complete obscurity\". But she does acknowledge that a higher profile will have at least one practical advantage. \"'Salley' means willow in Irish, and the spelling of my name comes from 'Down by the Salley Gardens' by W B Yeats,\" she explains. \"It's a nuisance when it comes to computerised book databases because I come up as 'not known'.\" Not for much longer, she won't.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> The Cold Six Thousand</strong> <br> James Ellroy <br>711pp, Century, \u00a316.99<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000380823,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p> Over 700 pages of stripped-down prose, repetitive riffs coming at you in sentences of threes, and the same incantatory rhythm throughout; minus adjectives for the most part, and hardly an adverb in sight. This is not prose as we are used to it; more of a frittata, the same consistency wherever you cut into it. Actually, it's not as easy as that, although reviewers are saying: what can you expect from a crime writer getting above himself? Ellroy clearly trusts his inner voice, and is prepared to push obsession to a point where he risks becoming a bore. </p> <p> The Cold Six Thousand is pretty much the Ellroy show, and a further example of how he has turned himself into the star of his recent work, becoming a gumshoe to history and putting US politics into the pulp blender. Ellroy clearly holds that the tabloid/crime format is the only true way of reading that history, and that nothing is sacred. The Cold Six Thousand is a work of enormous stamina and monomaniacal intensity. </p> <p>One could go further and say that writers such as Ellroy and Don DeLillo are doing what we expected of American cinema - recharting its history, myth and psyche. In American Tabloid , a reworking of the JFK era filtered through DeLillo's Libra , Ellroy saw American history entirely in terms of the overlap of political/criminal enterprise. Much of his line was the standard alternative to the Warren Commission, but he assembled his narrative with the skill of those kids you used to see solving Rubik's Cubes at lightning speed and delivered it all in speedball prose with a crystalline rush to match Jack Kennedy's pharmaceutical intake. </p> <p> The Cold Six Thousand follows on from American Tabloid , with surviving players negotiating the long hangover down to 1968 and the gunnings of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King via several routes - Las Vegas, Howard Hughes, Vietnam, CIA dope-dealing, Cuba, sleazy showbiz, racism and the Klan. Ellroy's characters divide between history's string-pullers (Hoover, Hughes, the mob) and their scene-shifters, some real (Fred Otash, Sonny Liston), some not. Men tend to be half in love with each other, while their women exist as troublesome, invariably ballsy satellites. All are unhinged by the death of that feckless charmer, Jack Kennedy, from whom they drew their bearings. Most characters are irredeemable, bought off, or fakes like Jack. Bad conscience, where applicable, is usually a troublesome remnant of upbringing. Everyone is defined by their racism, expletives and visceral responses - all clinically logged - and the main fuel is hatred. </p> <p>The cast also acts out DeLillo's dictum that history comes down to people talking in rooms - except that in Ellroy's version, rooms are bugged to infinity. Characters are wound up rather than revealed through inner workings, lives defined by what Ellroy would call \"boocoo air miles\" - so much so that The Cold Six Thousand starts to feel like an endless loop of Lee Marvin marching with gunshot footsteps down the corridors of LA's airport in Point Blank , a film that has something of the same sense of conspiracy, dream, revenge and contrived angularity. </p> <p>The narrative is even more Shakespearean than its predecessor in its complex political machinations, fiendish plotting and lines of fate. And it is even bigger-cast and bigger-budget in the ground covered and the enormous amount of disposable income involved - a dark fairytale of the black economy, a last movie that no one could afford to make. Ellroy presents his world of fabulous conspiracy in language that isits opposite: tack-gun prose that eschews metaphor and speculation and whose highest stylistic aspiration is the heavy pun, its main inspirations the procedural and the tabloid. </p> <p>In a world so governed by double-dealing, the only recourse is to dish the dirt, and dish Ellroy does. The book's most salient influences are the National Enquirer and the crime-scene report. Ellroy makes frequent use of document inserts and phone-tap transcripts, and the result is more historical dossier than conventional literary text. The reader sinks or swims in its contradictory flows: post-mortem for long stretches, crassly clownish elsewhere, and often close to hysteria, its momentum coming mostly from a ferocious cartoon energy. </p> <p>It is too early to say whether The Cold Six Thousand might be the great centrepiece in a trilogy (ending with Watergate?); ditto whether Ellroy is writing himself into a cul-de-sac or merely writing one up. Either way, Ellroy's literary ambitions should not be underestimated: he writes the dandiest of artless prose. If American Tabloid went all the way to the wire, down to the last line of its \"big fucking scream\", this is more narcotic, and the reader can be excused for nodding out. It shares some of the whacked-out quality of Apocalypse Now , a film whose mess is too often mistaken for greatness. Ellroy is better organised as a storyteller than Coppola, and more of a moralist. His characters' weariness is an exhaustion of the soul, as much as anything, and in the tight nugget of his central fiction most are allotted the fates they deserve. Ellroy is at his most conventional in his retribution. </p> <p>Potential confusion lies in there being little to distinguish - apart from its nursery-rhyme rhythms - between a throwaway line on jet lag (\"Travels fucks with me\") and the climactic act of revenge that the book has chased through 650 pages: \"He grabbed Wendell's left hand. He shot off his fingers. He shot off his thumb.\" That said, with an author as line-controlling as Ellroy, such confusion will be calculated. The quality mark of The Cold Six Thousand is that it can give heavyweight punch to even that most worked-over image, the shooting of JFK - \"Pete saw Big D. Jack's head goes ka-blooey. Jackie dives for scraps.\" </p> <p>Knockout.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Cold Six Thousand James Ellroy 711pp, Century, \u00a316.99 Buy it at a discount at BOL Over 700 pages of stripped-down prose, repetitive riffs coming at you in sentences of threes, and the same incantatory rhythm throughout; minus adjectives for the most part, and hardly an adverb in sight. This is not prose as we are used to it; more of a frittata, the same consistency wherever you cut into it. Actually, it's not as easy as that, although reviewers are saying: what can you expect from a crime writer getting above himself? Ellroy clearly trusts his inner voice, and is prepared to push obsession to a point where he risks becoming a bore. The Cold Six Thousand is pretty much the Ellroy show, and a further example of how he has turned himself into the star of his recent work, becoming a gumshoe to history and putting US politics into the pulp blender. Ellroy clearly holds that the tabloid/crime format is the only true way of reading that history, and that nothing is sacred. The Cold Six Thousand is a work of enormous stamina and monomaniacal intensity. One could go further and say that writers such as Ellroy and Don DeLillo are doing what we expected of American cinema - recharting its history, myth and psyche. In American Tabloid , a reworking of the JFK era filtered through DeLillo's Libra , Ellroy saw American history entirely in terms of the overlap of political/criminal enterprise. Much of his line was the standard alternative to the Warren Commission, but he assembled his narrative with the skill of those kids you used to see solving Rubik's Cubes at lightning speed and delivered it all in speedball prose with a crystalline rush to match Jack Kennedy's pharmaceutical intake. The Cold Six Thousand follows on from American Tabloid , with surviving players negotiating the long hangover down to 1968 and the gunnings of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King via several routes - Las Vegas, Howard Hughes, Vietnam, CIA dope-dealing, Cuba, sleazy showbiz, racism and the Klan. Ellroy's characters divide between history's string-pullers (Hoover, Hughes, the mob) and their scene-shifters, some real (Fred Otash, Sonny Liston), some not. Men tend to be half in love with each other, while their women exist as troublesome, invariably ballsy satellites. All are unhinged by the death of that feckless charmer, Jack Kennedy, from whom they drew their bearings. Most characters are irredeemable, bought off, or fakes like Jack. Bad conscience, where applicable, is usually a troublesome remnant of upbringing. Everyone is defined by their racism, expletives and visceral responses - all clinically logged - and the main fuel is hatred. The cast also acts out DeLillo's dictum that history comes down to people talking in rooms - except that in Ellroy's version, rooms are bugged to infinity. Characters are wound up rather than revealed through inner workings, lives defined by what Ellroy would call \"boocoo air miles\" - so much so that The Cold Six Thousand starts to feel like an endless loop of Lee Marvin marching with gunshot footsteps down the corridors of LA's airport in Point Blank , a film that has something of the same sense of conspiracy, dream, revenge and contrived angularity. The narrative is even more Shakespearean than its predecessor in its complex political machinations, fiendish plotting and lines of fate. And it is even bigger-cast and bigger-budget in the ground covered and the enormous amount of disposable income involved - a dark fairytale of the black economy, a last movie that no one could afford to make. Ellroy presents his world of fabulous conspiracy in language that isits opposite: tack-gun prose that eschews metaphor and speculation and whose highest stylistic aspiration is the heavy pun, its main inspirations the procedural and the tabloid. In a world so governed by double-dealing, the only recourse is to dish the dirt, and dish Ellroy does. The book's most salient influences are the National Enquirer and the crime-scene report. Ellroy makes frequent use of document inserts and phone-tap transcripts, and the result is more historical dossier than conventional literary text. The reader sinks or swims in its contradictory flows: post-mortem for long stretches, crassly clownish elsewhere, and often close to hysteria, its momentum coming mostly from a ferocious cartoon energy. It is too early to say whether The Cold Six Thousand might be the great centrepiece in a trilogy (ending with Watergate?); ditto whether Ellroy is writing himself into a cul-de-sac or merely writing one up. Either way, Ellroy's literary ambitions should not be underestimated: he writes the dandiest of artless prose. If American Tabloid went all the way to the wire, down to the last line of its \"big fucking scream\", this is more narcotic, and the reader can be excused for nodding out. It shares some of the whacked-out quality of Apocalypse Now , a film whose mess is too often mistaken for greatness. Ellroy is better organised as a storyteller than Coppola, and more of a moralist. His characters' weariness is an exhaustion of the soul, as much as anything, and in the tight nugget of his central fiction most are allotted the fates they deserve. Ellroy is at his most conventional in his retribution. Potential confusion lies in there being little to distinguish - apart from its nursery-rhyme rhythms - between a throwaway line on jet lag (\"Travels fucks with me\") and the climactic act of revenge that the book has chased through 650 pages: \"He grabbed Wendell's left hand. He shot off his fingers. He shot off his thumb.\" That said, with an author as line-controlling as Ellroy, such confusion will be calculated. The quality mark of The Cold Six Thousand is that it can give heavyweight punch to even that most worked-over image, the shooting of JFK - \"Pete saw Big D. Jack's head goes ka-blooey. Jackie dives for scraps.\" Knockout.",
