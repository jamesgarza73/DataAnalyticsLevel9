      "bodyText": "Postgraduate courses, like evening classes, often seem like a good idea at the time. Somehow we hope that the act of signing up for a year or more and handing over a significant wad of cash will provide a sufficient boost to our career prospects, making the hours of hard graft to gain the qualification worthwhile. For some graduates it can be little more than a delaying tactic, putting off the evil day when they have to decide what they will do with their working lives. But in most cases a good postgraduate qualification will enhance your development and skills, building on those you have already gained at either undergraduate level or through your work and life experiences. It will stand you in good stead whatever you decide to do in the future and can only enhance your career prospects. In recent years there has been a proliferation of courses designed to prepare graduates for specific job market. Courses with more academic or theoretical emphasis tend to be masters programmes; those with a more applied or practical bent often lead to postgraduate diplomas. In particular the demand from the IT industry for suitably qualified and skilled graduates has seen a rapid development of computing-related postgraduate degrees. London Guildhall University, for example offers postgraduate qualifications in computing, information systems and multimedia as well as an MSc in information systems development. Applicants are usually expected to have an honours degree with a substantial computing component. However, the university says graduates with an appropriate industry or business background may also be considered and in \"certain exceptional circumstances\", those with extensive experience in a relevant area may also be considered eligible. The LGU teaching programme aims to develop an understanding of the core skills of systems development. The university says it provides graduates with the knowledge and skills required to prepare them to work on the analysis, design and implementation of information systems in a commercial context. The structure of the courses is modular, making it more accessible for those in work and where possible, the modules have also been designed to be free-standing to allow students an even greater measure of flexibility. According to the university, many of its students go on to work in areas such as database applications programming, systems administration and analysis, design and development, or systems research in industrial R&amp;D environments. The LGU also offers an MSc in IT consultancy, providing graduates with an opportunity to study the latest developments in IT applications, acquire skills and develop an understanding of the issues affecting individuals, organisations and society. The MSc is based on an inter- disciplinary approach and aimed primarily at people who wish to work in a freelance capacity, possibly on short-term or long-term contracts, or in IT-related project work in their own companies. There are plenty of IT conversion courses on offer which concentrate on computing and the business applications of IT, but Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh claims its MSc and Diploma in information technology have a unique emphasis. The aim of its courses, says the university is to provide a broad-based introduction to IT, with options in business, systems or human computer interaction. Heriot-Watt says the course has been taken successfully by students from a wide range of disciplines but stresses that it is \"not suitable for graduates in the arts\".

She is half way through her PGCE and currently on teaching practice at a school in East Croydon. \"When I left college I thought about teaching but when it came to it, the idea went out of the window and I followed most of my friends into the City, partly lured by the money. I was working as an assistant manager for Gartmore Investment Management but I soon realised it wasn't me. I found I was pushing bits of paper around the office and, in the main, every day was the same. </p> <p>\"After finally deciding to leave and despite a couple of false starts, I left and went travelling for three months. I even went back to another job in the City before realising teaching was the right move. Now I'm here, I wish I'd done it earlier. </p> <p>\"Although the first day of teaching was terrifying, now I've settled down the level of job satisfaction is in a different league and every day is different, even though it's often the same children. The challenge is teaching classes of differing abilities and working out which ones need extra help at which stage.\" </p> <p>Interestingly, Steele who is 25, reports that only half of the 25 people on her course have come straight from college, while the others have done everything else from being mothers to working in advertising. </p> <p>One area she has been less than happy with is the problem of getting the local education authority to sort out student loans. \"Lots of the group are still waiting for the money months after starting the course. I'm sure they'll be quicker to get in touch when we're qualified,\" she says. </p> <p>Another graduate who has turned his back on the world of company cars is Nigel Fisher. When Rise caught up with him last week, he was preparing to take a class load of 17-year olds for the half-term ski trip to the French Alps. Fisher now works in a sixth form college in Brighton but was previously an environmental consultant. </p> <p>\"I was assessing the environmental impact of road schemes and power stations and enjoying it.

      "body": "<p>The footballing wallahs at Fifa will be feeling a little smug today. The game's governing body could hardly have picked a more vibrant place to begin the marathon journey to the 2002 World Cup finals this evening than Port of Spain's Hasley Crawford National Stadium. For it is carnival weekend in Trinidad and Tobago, and the party will be in full effect when the hosts take on Netherlands Antilles. </p> <p>While Trinidad and Tobago's opener is merely the first of 809 games to decide who fills the remaining 29 places for World Cup 2002, the revellers in Port of Spain will view it as the moment the carnival goes into overdrive. Only the carnival cities of Brazil and New Orleans could possibly compete with the frenetic atmosphere - despite the fact that not everyone here will be dancing to the same beat. </p> <p>After Trinidad and Tobago's recent Gold Cup disappointment, losing 1-0 to Canada in the semi-finals, their manager Bertille St Clair was sacked. Now the Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke, among others, has threatened not to play for his national side until St Clair is reinstated. </p> <p>To be fair, Yorke would not have played tonight anyway, events at Old Trafford proving a weightier distraction. But the Trinidad football authorities will not be allowed to brush the matter under the carpet just because the carnival is in town. </p> <p>For the rest of the world, the next 632 days of qualifying will see hopes dashed, dreams fulfilled and mismatches of the most humiliating kind. Indeed, such is the allure of Japan and South Korea in 2 years' time that only one of Fifa's 203 members withdrew from qualifying on account of a lack of skill: Papua New Guinea has instead prepared a development programme aimed at 2006. Three others, Burundi, Niger and Afghanistan, opted out due to political conflict and financial hardship; North Korea remains ambivalent towards its host neighbour. </p> <p>They will not be joining the hosts and the holders France at the most commercially driven tournament of all, but for the 20 million who are expected to attend the qualifying matches from Macao to the Maldives, the motivations are the same. </p> <p>There are up to 14 qualifying spots from Europe, four or five from South America, five from Africa, two or three from Asia (to go with Japan and South Korea), three from Concacaf (grouping the Caribbean, North and Central America) and one from Oceania, if its representative gets past a play-off. </p> <p>As the Caribbean launches its challenge this weekend, hopes remain high for Trinidad and Tobago. Netherlands Antilles have never scored a goal against them in three World Cup matches and, despite the dismissal of St Clair, the home side are one of the favourites to shimmy their way to one of the Caribbean's three slots in the Concacaf qualifiers, where relative giants such as Mexico and the United States enter the fray. </p> <p>There again this is Trinidad, where the Attorney General, a lifelong opponent of capital punishment, hanged nine men in a single weekend last year; and this is World Cup football, where anything can happen. You have got to expect a double measure of controversy, and the opening game in Port of Spain has it in spades. </p> <p>St Clair led the national team to its best-ever performance in the Gold Cup, yet was sacked immediately upon his return. Understandably, not everyone in Trinidad and Tobago agreed with the three-man committee that dropped the axe. </p> <p>\"Canada was by far one of the weakest teams in the tournament,\" said the Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation special adviser Jack Warner of the eventual Gold Cup winners. \"I have consistently said that in spite of our success and victories, I still find the team to be technically deficient in several areas, particularly our defence and midfield.\" </p> <p>Shaka Hislop and Russell Latapy, Trinidad and Tobago's other leading players from British clubs, are also said to be extremely unhappy about the sacking, as are most callers to television and radio chat shows. Following the resignation of Trinidad's favourite son Brian Lara from the captaincy of the West Indies cricket team, sport has kept a heady profile here.

      "bodyText": "The footballing wallahs at Fifa will be feeling a little smug today. The game's governing body could hardly have picked a more vibrant place to begin the marathon journey to the 2002 World Cup finals this evening than Port of Spain's Hasley Crawford National Stadium. For it is carnival weekend in Trinidad and Tobago, and the party will be in full effect when the hosts take on Netherlands Antilles. While Trinidad and Tobago's opener is merely the first of 809 games to decide who fills the remaining 29 places for World Cup 2002, the revellers in Port of Spain will view it as the moment the carnival goes into overdrive. Only the carnival cities of Brazil and New Orleans could possibly compete with the frenetic atmosphere - despite the fact that not everyone here will be dancing to the same beat. After Trinidad and Tobago's recent Gold Cup disappointment, losing 1-0 to Canada in the semi-finals, their manager Bertille St Clair was sacked. Now the Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke, among others, has threatened not to play for his national side until St Clair is reinstated. To be fair, Yorke would not have played tonight anyway, events at Old Trafford proving a weightier distraction. But the Trinidad football authorities will not be allowed to brush the matter under the carpet just because the carnival is in town. For the rest of the world, the next 632 days of qualifying will see hopes dashed, dreams fulfilled and mismatches of the most humiliating kind. Indeed, such is the allure of Japan and South Korea in 2 years' time that only one of Fifa's 203 members withdrew from qualifying on account of a lack of skill: Papua New Guinea has instead prepared a development programme aimed at 2006. Three others, Burundi, Niger and Afghanistan, opted out due to political conflict and financial hardship; North Korea remains ambivalent towards its host neighbour. They will not be joining the hosts and the holders France at the most commercially driven tournament of all, but for the 20 million who are expected to attend the qualifying matches from Macao to the Maldives, the motivations are the same. There are up to 14 qualifying spots from Europe, four or five from South America, five from Africa, two or three from Asia (to go with Japan and South Korea), three from Concacaf (grouping the Caribbean, North and Central America) and one from Oceania, if its representative gets past a play-off. As the Caribbean launches its challenge this weekend, hopes remain high for Trinidad and Tobago. Netherlands Antilles have never scored a goal against them in three World Cup matches and, despite the dismissal of St Clair, the home side are one of the favourites to shimmy their way to one of the Caribbean's three slots in the Concacaf qualifiers, where relative giants such as Mexico and the United States enter the fray. There again this is Trinidad, where the Attorney General, a lifelong opponent of capital punishment, hanged nine men in a single weekend last year; and this is World Cup football, where anything can happen. You have got to expect a double measure of controversy, and the opening game in Port of Spain has it in spades. St Clair led the national team to its best-ever performance in the Gold Cup, yet was sacked immediately upon his return. Understandably, not everyone in Trinidad and Tobago agreed with the three-man committee that dropped the axe. \"Canada was by far one of the weakest teams in the tournament,\" said the Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation special adviser Jack Warner of the eventual Gold Cup winners. \"I have consistently said that in spite of our success and victories, I still find the team to be technically deficient in several areas, particularly our defence and midfield.\" Shaka Hislop and Russell Latapy, Trinidad and Tobago's other leading players from British clubs, are also said to be extremely unhappy about the sacking, as are most callers to television and radio chat shows. Following the resignation of Trinidad's favourite son Brian Lara from the captaincy of the West Indies cricket team, sport has kept a heady profile here. There is talk of a boycott of today's game, but that will happen only if someone throws a massive free party on the other side of town at kick-off. Whether or not St Clair is reinstated, the only thing that can prevent the stadium from being packed beyond fire safety regulations is if everyone wakes up too hung over from last night to be able to move before this evening. But that is extremely unlikely, given that most people will not even be going to sleep until next Wednesday. \u0095 The Cayman Islands team, beefed up by a number of British-based players face a daunting opener in Havana where they take on Cuba tomorrow. Cuba, who played in the 1938 World Cup finals in France, has seen football overtaken in popularity by several sports, but still scored a 6-1 aggregate win over the Caymans in the qualifiers four years ago.

We had to lie on the floor and that was a draw. \"Then we beat Morocco in the next match and the same people were using their shirts to clean the bus. They were dancing, shouting 'We are back.' There were banners saying, 'We are sorry.' It was fun but really serious business.\" For Sodje, determined to find favour again at Luton, the serious business goes on.",

Victory over Manchester United will move Houllier's side within seven points of the championship leaders with a game in hand. Their prospects are only improved by the news that Roy Keane and Paul Scholes are doubtful starters. </p> <p>The more optimistic members of the Anfield clan make play of the fact that, of the current top five, only Liverpool are working free of the \"burden\" of involvement in some form of cup competition.

He is, nevertheless, apparently keen enough to take something from today's game to recall Michael Owen for his first competitive outing in six weeks. </p> <p>\"It is extremely unrealistic to suggest we can win the title,\" Houllier says. \"Manchester United will win the Premiership title again - I am sure of that. I am sure it is already finished. They are too good a side to let it slip from the position they now find themselves in; they have far too many good and experienced players. </p> <p>\"Of course we would dearly love to win at Old Trafford, if only because that would move us a step closer to what has always been our primary objective: qualification for next season's Champions League. That is what we want, that is what we need.\" </p> <p>Since assuming sole responsibility for Liverpool's fortunes a little more than 12 months ago, Houllier has wasted few words, always preferring to deliver an honest appraisal than attempt to appease those who struggle with home truths. The speed with which the awful blandness and under-achievement of recent seasons has been forgotten is such that Houllier seems to have been around for years, his fixed smile to the fore as he preaches his amiable Dumas-esque doctrine of all for one and one for all. </p> <p>Only once after succeeding his one-time partner Roy Evans did he slip out of character, opting for a massive, calculated gamble by gathering together practically all the cash available to him and spending it with astonishing haste. Houllier's now famous player-a-week trawl through the civilised world netted no fewer than eight new players at a combined cost of almost \u00a330m.</p> <p>Some, most notably Vladimir Smicer, have still to settle but the portents are good.

It's so difficult to find the right men for the big job but G\u00e9rard may just have done it. </p> <p>\"When you see his team play you feel they are going about their business in a well-schooled and professional way. I do believe Liverpool are now ready to re-emerge as a genuine force. They have yet to master the necessary art of picking up points when they don't play well - as Manchester United and Arsenal have - but they are on their way back.\" </p> <p>Managers and pundits do not always occupy common ground but on this occasion Houllier and Lawrenson sing loudly from the same song-sheet. \"Yes, sorting out the defence was my priority,\" Houllier says. \"We needed stability and reliability; we needed a rock-solid heart to the back four. There were other areas of the team which needed working on but you must have a good foundation upon which to build. Sami and St\u00e9phane have done ever so well for us.\" </p> <p>But for a shaky opening to the campaign, when the jigsaw puzzle refused to lock together, it is conceivable Liverpool would now be rubbing shoulders with United rather than treading on their coat-tails. \"We picked up just 10 points from our opening eight games,\" Houllier continues, \"but since the beginning of October our form has been championship form rather than Champions League qualification form.

And yesterday the Frenchman did nothing to dispel the idea that he had tumbled theatrically. </p> <p>\"Djalminha came at me and pushed me, what can I say?\" said the 29-year-old, whose foul on Djalminha sparked the incident at Highbury. \"I was sent off against Barcelona in the Champions League and it was exactly the same. I made a movement towards a player and got a red card which ruled me out for three matches. He made a movement towards me. I was involved in the same thing and I learned from it.\" </p> <p>Even Ars\u00e8ne Wenger admitted his player \"may have over-reacted a little bit\", although the Arsenal manager added: \"He was pushed quite hard. I don't think he had any option but to go down and so it is difficult to say he was cheating.\" </p> <p>Djalminha can expect a three-match ban after being shown a straight red card for violent conduct and could could face further disciplinary action after being accused of spitting at the Bulgarian referee, Atanas Ouzounov, at the end of the game. </p> <p>The Brazilian's spit is said to have landed on the sleeve of a referee's assistant. \"We will wait to see our official observer's report,\" Uefa said, \"but we can also investigate video evidence and press reports.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile Wenger admittted after the 5-1 victory over Deportivo that playing home Champions League matches at Wembley was an error. Over two seasons they have lost three of their six matches there. </p> <p>Uefa regulations, which among other things would have reduced Highbury's capacity to 32,000, were pivotal to the decision. But Wenger said: \"In hindsight I can say at the moment, yes, it was a mistake.\" </p> <p>Leeds United are stepping up their efforts to sign a striker, believed to be Wimbledon's England Under-21 international Carl Cort. </p> <p>The Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale said: \"It is a striker. I won't say who it was but last Sunday I made a \u00a35m bid for a player and just in case the person I made the bid to is listening, I haven't had a response.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Two Leeds fans stabbed in brawls before the club's Uefa Cup tie at Roma on Thursday have left hospital in Italy. </p> <p>\u0095 A Chelsea fan has been jailed for two months by a French court for his part in the violence which marred Tuesday's Champions League game at Marseille. Clifford Clem, 30, was jailed in Marseille and forbidden from re-entering French territory for three years. </p> <p>\u0095 Uefa may relax its deadline for the registration of Euro 2000 squads after complaints from coaches, including Kevin Keegan. The 22-man squad is due in by midnight on May 31, the day of several friendlies. England play Ukraine that night, leaving Keegan two hours to name his squad. </p> <p>\u0095 Fifa will not suspend players who test positive for the banned steroid nandrolone after a study involving 148 Swiss footballers showed men produce it naturally. </p> <p>\"It was found... that under physical stress men do indeed produce endogenously nandrolone in a quantity that is such that the threshold value of two nanograms per millilitre of urine could well be produced by the athlete himself,\" Fifa said.</p>",

And yesterday the Frenchman did nothing to dispel the idea that he had tumbled theatrically. \"Djalminha came at me and pushed me, what can I say?\" said the 29-year-old, whose foul on Djalminha sparked the incident at Highbury. \"I was sent off against Barcelona in the Champions League and it was exactly the same. I made a movement towards a player and got a red card which ruled me out for three matches. He made a movement towards me. I was involved in the same thing and I learned from it.\" Even Ars\u00e8ne Wenger admitted his player \"may have over-reacted a little bit\", although the Arsenal manager added: \"He was pushed quite hard. I don't think he had any option but to go down and so it is difficult to say he was cheating.\" Djalminha can expect a three-match ban after being shown a straight red card for violent conduct and could could face further disciplinary action after being accused of spitting at the Bulgarian referee, Atanas Ouzounov, at the end of the game. The Brazilian's spit is said to have landed on the sleeve of a referee's assistant. \"We will wait to see our official observer's report,\" Uefa said, \"but we can also investigate video evidence and press reports.\" Meanwhile Wenger admittted after the 5-1 victory over Deportivo that playing home Champions League matches at Wembley was an error. Over two seasons they have lost three of their six matches there. Uefa regulations, which among other things would have reduced Highbury's capacity to 32,000, were pivotal to the decision. But Wenger said: \"In hindsight I can say at the moment, yes, it was a mistake.\" Leeds United are stepping up their efforts to sign a striker, believed to be Wimbledon's England Under-21 international Carl Cort. The Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale said: \"It is a striker. I won't say who it was but last Sunday I made a \u00a35m bid for a player and just in case the person I made the bid to is listening, I haven't had a response.\" \u0095 Two Leeds fans stabbed in brawls before the club's Uefa Cup tie at Roma on Thursday have left hospital in Italy. \u0095 A Chelsea fan has been jailed for two months by a French court for his part in the violence which marred Tuesday's Champions League game at Marseille. Clifford Clem, 30, was jailed in Marseille and forbidden from re-entering French territory for three years. \u0095 Uefa may relax its deadline for the registration of Euro 2000 squads after complaints from coaches, including Kevin Keegan. The 22-man squad is due in by midnight on May 31, the day of several friendlies. England play Ukraine that night, leaving Keegan two hours to name his squad. \u0095 Fifa will not suspend players who test positive for the banned steroid nandrolone after a study involving 148 Swiss footballers showed men produce it naturally. \"It was found... that under physical stress men do indeed produce endogenously nandrolone in a quantity that is such that the threshold value of two nanograms per millilitre of urine could well be produced by the athlete himself,\" Fifa said.",

Welcome to Sharm el Sheikh and the 11th Commandment: only drink bottled water. </p> <p>Not everyone, to be honest, seems quite sure where Sharm el Sheikh is. I certainly wasn't when I booked. I thought (a last-minute dotty comment) that it was probably somewhere near Aqaba, with sidetrips to Petra made easy. The reality is rather more detached than that; and the ignorance, perhaps, forgivable. </p> <p>Thirty years ago, in the wake of the Six-Day War, the southern tip of the Sinai peninsula had nothing to show where the Old Testament world touched the Red Sea. </p> <p>Tiran island, just offshore, was strategically vital. Nasser had tried to use it to close off Eilat. The Israelis promptly captured the whole of Sinai and then looked for a military staging post. They, in a sense, invented Sharm el Sheikh. Then, after a meeting at Camp David, peace was restored and an international monitoring force was established, which sits even today on Tiran, and the Sinai was Egyptian again. Enter the tourist tribes. </p> <p>The domain of this transient population stretches some 20km along the coast from the airport. There's \"Old Sharm\" where the workers live and the bazaars are familiar eastern cubbyholes. That venerable Sharm is about 10 years old. The rest is five years gone at most and still a vast building site. Pell-mell development began when a privatising Cairo government opened its doors to international investors. The millions (in dollars, marks and francs) have come flooding in, ringing the bays with hotels, golf courses, casinos and villas for the rich. Another Las Vegas in the arid middle of nowhere. </p> <p>Your idea of holiday hell? Perhaps, in the recounting: but the Hiltons and Sheratons and Marriotts aren't all mad. They've bought into a project they think may become one of Europe's great winter playgrounds - and they have more than blind faith in their investment portfolio. </p> <p>We stayed at the most completed of the artificial sub-towns, Naama Bay. It didn't look promising. This is, literally, a strip in the Vegas style: a double-carriageway between hotels and shopping centres, one side backing on to the sea, the other trailing straight into desert. Somewhere below Benidorm in the charm stakes. Yet appearances are deceptive and the view from the water is what matters. </p> <p>There, a kilometre of palm-fringed boardwalk curls along the edge of the bay. The beaches are scattered with caf\u00e9s and bars, the hotels open out into an international array of restaurants. It's a strolling, sheltered place from the town to the west and the great jutting promontory in the east where you can stand and watch the sun set be-hind jagged ranges of mountains as though on a giant Cinemascope screen. </p> <p>And, of course, the sun also rises with punctilious efficiency. Deserts (amazing non-revelation) are deserts because it hardly ever rains. </p> <p>Predictable sunshine every month of the year - though it can touch 50 degrees in July and August. This - save for one swathe of visitors - isn't a summer place. Peak seasons are autumn and early spring, before the heat builds; but in the first weeks of February it was already England on a fine June day, with no more than light sweaters needed for evening strolls. </p> <p>Sharm el Sheikh, though, is a tale of two temperatures: air and water, and one matters just as much as the other. There are two kinds of people on the winter boardwalk: greying panthers escaping the north European chill and hundreds of twentysomethings, come for the diving and snorkelling. The Red Sea remains scuba heaven. </p> <p>The coral reef in Coral Bay, rather against the odds, still lives and teems with fish. Every hotel along the strand has its own boat and instructors - and there are many more independents as well. They all offer the Near and Middle Gardens, then the wonder of the Far Garden (and the reefs at Ras Mohammed national park, a morning's drive away). </p> <p>You don't have to be an expert to dive. They'll teach you on the spot; and the all-British team at the Red Sea Diving College did that for my wife. The snorkelling, too, is exceptional. \"I think I met a barracuda before breakfast,\" she said insouciantly. </p> <p>It's chilliest, the underwater inspectors say, in December and January; but February was still wetsuit bracing. Warm-bath addicts would probably do best in high summer - and hope to make it back to their rooms intact through the desert broil. A morning's diving will cost you around \u00a330, including all the kit. Snorkelling's half as much. </p> <p>What else is there to do, on dry land? Eating, from the Hard Rock to Japanese and endless trattorias. Drinking at beachside bars. Sunbathing, and the usual array of fitness kicks. But after that the options tend to get a trifle limited: there's the Sinai - and the Sinai. That demands exploration, by jeep on a camping trip far into the wilderness with assorted Bedouin stops, or more conventionally by coach to the theoretical solitude of St Catherine's monastery in the shadow of Mount Sinai, where the queueing hordes make the first night of the Dome look modest. </p> <p>The 22 Greek Orthodox monks, guides to a rota, will show you the \"original\", if transplanted, burning bush; the greatest religious library outside the Vatican; and a handy charnel house where every monk's bones since the sixth century is stored amid a mountain of skulls. They'll also tell you how St Catherine was tortured on a spiked wheel, the Catherine wheel. But the monastery itself - and still less the \"tourist village\" down the hill - isn't really the point of a 400km round-trip: the point is the southern desert, a changing panorama of granite and then sandstone threaded by great flat valleys and etched against a perfect blue sky. </p> <p>The drive, swirling along empty roads in the clearest of light, is like a hypnotic video game. The gentle walk up Mount Sinai takes three hours, and strategically-sited Bedouins will feed you coffee on the way. It's a place, once seen, that can't be forgotten. \u00a335 a head with a surprisingly decent lunch thrown in. </p> <p>The rest of the available excursions, however, don't begin to compete. You can fly to Luxor or Petra for a couple of days. You can bus to Cairo and back in 14 hours of travelling time and fit in the Pyramids in between. </p> <p>But at root Sharm el Sheikh is an island in its own sea of sand and rocky scrub. It's a tourist theme park, Arabyland, not a real place. Nothing grows; nothing's made. The fruit, the vegetables, the population, the infrastructure, are all imported from distant parts. Only the fish arrive direct. </p> <p>History effectively begins about eight years ago. There are advantages to this. The hotels are all brand new and spankingly tended. The staff, from top to bottom, are brilliantly trained. The waiters speak German, English and French or Italian. Because space is almost infinite, nothing's cramped. Because there is massive investment to protect, tourist police are everywhere and hotel security staff patrol constantly. It's the safest place money can buy. </p> <p>You bargain for almost everything, of course, but only as a pale imitation of normality: Cairo Lite. Communications are splendid. Instant mobile connections, with the added bonus of internet caf\u00e9s on tap at \u00a34 an hour. I surfed the net while my wife snorkelled the reef. </p> <p>The clientele thus attracted is pleasantly eclec tic and by no means British-dominated. Germans, Swiss, French, Italians, Greeks. Here is the European Union taking a break. </p> <p>Problems? You need to be very sure where the hotel and the travel agency are offering you a room. We stayed at a predictably-efficient Movenpick resort and took a room with a \"desert view\". That turned out to be code for \"on the other side of the road\" with a frontal view of the Sinai Water Company - and a good 12 minutes' tramp to breakfast. Anything on the desert side is cheaper, of course, but you need to like hiking. Sea-view room supplements (maybe \u00a340 a week dearer) are probably worth it. Be careful, too, to pick a hotel with its own beach area. The public beaches are slivers of desolation, and repeated entrance fees to the private areas could ratchet up costs alarmingly. </p> <p>The distance of your hotel from the town areas can also matter. Basically, the nearer you are to the airport, the further from leisured civilisation. A second Movenpick, with golf and a confected tropical garden to turn the Disney Corporation green with envy, exudes luxury in an isolation that could grow a little oppressive - until they finish the town that they're building to keep it company. But there are always mini-buses, moving back and forth, and taxis (at a highly theoretical \u00a32 maximum fare anywhere in Sharm) are everywhere. </p> <p>The over-arching question, perhaps, is whether the millions flooding in will ever turn a profit flowing out. Sharm el Sheikh isn't wholly on the map yet. It is grandiose work in progress as new hotels and villas fill in the gaps between the bulldozers. Thousands of rooms chasing occupants. Dozens of restaurants in search of the dining classes. \"How was your fish?\" enquired an anxious manager. \"Very bony,\" I said, with extreme accuracy. \"Oh thank you so much, sir. Most kind.\" It is an endearing enthusiasm. He asked me to go to his rival down the road the next night and ring him to contrast and compare. </p> <p>Anything can go wrong. Sharm expanded may collapse under the weight of its gargantuan ambition. A tremor of political instability could make horrendous waves. Coral reefs die rather more certainly than they live. But, for the moment, this instant lotusland five-and-a-bit non-jetlagged hours from Gatwick, is trying hard. A week at a time is probably enough, but as a new winter sets in or an old winter lingers, there is a shortish-haul alternative setting out a formidably ambitious stall. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>The Prestons flew Kuoni charter by Monarch (Thursdays in and out from Gatwick) and stayed at Movenpick in Naama Bay for a cut price \u00a3339 each. Seven nights at brochure price cost \u00a3459 per person including return flights, transfers, accomodation and breakfast. Details: 01306 747000.</p>",

The practicals The Prestons flew Kuoni charter by Monarch (Thursdays in and out from Gatwick) and stayed at Movenpick in Naama Bay for a cut price \u00a3339 each. Seven nights at brochure price cost \u00a3459 per person including return flights, transfers, accomodation and breakfast. Details: 01306 747000.",

It's the place his father took him and his twin brother when they were children for long walks and picnics on the clifftops, and it's the place where he now goes with his wife and two daughters on summer weekends to relax and get away from the tensions of politics. </p> <p>But it's also the place where, two years ago, a wave swept two children into the sea and Paisley Jr was involved in a desperate effort to save them which brought him a Royal Humane Society award for bravery. </p> <p>\"That incident tinged those happy childhood memories for me,\" he says. \"It demonstrated that you have to have your wits about you - the sea and the coastline round here are very beautiful, but they can be dangerous.\" </p> <p>Most of his favourite walks are along the 11-mile North Antrim Cliff Path, which runs from Portballintrae in the west to Ballycastle in the east, past the Causeway and Benbane Head, the clifftop ruins of Dunseverick Castle and the swaying rope bridge over to Carrickarade Island, which excited and frightened him as a child. </p> <p>\"I wouldn't describe myself as an enthusiastic walker, so I wouldn't do the whole thing at one go,\" he says. \"But it's great for days out with the kids. Otherwise most of my walking tends to be round the constituencies, handing out leaflets - walking's very important for a politician in that sense.\" </p> <p>The Cliff Path is one of Ireland's most beautiful landscapes, and its special attraction for Unionists is that, on a clear day, you can see the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland. Myth also has it that the Giant's Causeway, with its strangely symmetrical volcanic basalt columns, was the attempt of the great warrior Fionn MacCumhail (anglicised as Finn MacCool) to create a link between the countries. </p> <p>\"There's a propinquity between Northern Ireland and Scotland and that sense of neighbourliness is emphasised when you can actually see it on the horizon as you walk along,\" says Paisley Jr. \"Unfortunately the story of the Red Hand is too vague about geography, but I would very much like to think it happened in County Antrim.\" </p> <p>The Red Hand, symbol of die-hard Ulster protestantism, refers to the race for Ulster between the Gaelic MacDonnells and the Norman de Burghs in the 12th century. De Burgh was leading as they struggled through the shallows, but MacDonnell won by cutting off his own hand and hurling it forward on to the beach. </p> <p>Paisley Jr is anxious to protect the Causeway coast, much of it well looked after by the National Trust, from the kind of random development he feels has happened in Donegal. He's not against second homes, but what you need after a long walk, he says, is a visit to a local hotel for a Finn MacCool steak: \"It's about as big as an armchair, and done any way you like.\"</p> <p><strong>The Ulster Way</strong></p> <p>If you want more than a leisurely day out at the Giant's Causeway, you can go to the opposite extreme and spend a month on the Ulster Way, which claims to be the longest waymarked path in the UK - 40 miles longer than the 600-mile South West Coast Path. </p> <p>The route goes north from Belfast through the beautiful nine Glens of Antrim, along the Causeway Coast, and then south through the Sperrin Mountains to the loughs of Fermanagh, crossing two mountains called Big Dog and Little Dog.

      "body": "<p>The incident began in the old royal city of Luang Prabang in central Laos with me photographing the woman, squatting by the pavement selling small bags of firewood, some embroidered squares and a crude metal bracelet. In return, she wanted a sale. She held up two fingers - which meant 2,000 kips - for the bracelet, no doubt expecting to be haggled down to 1,000. The driver of our jumbo - like a tuk-tuk but larger - said something that astounded her and then turned to us and said the price was 10,000 kips.</p> <p>Every one's head turned. Everyone froze. Would we pay 10 times the going rate?Why not? She needed it. We didn't. I handed over the money and took the bracelet. She was stunned. Everyone gawped. All over a miserly \u00a31.50. And it was suddenly clear what an amazing ride many Lao and hilltribe people are going to have as western commerce, tourism and media take off in the emerging Divine Kingdom. You do not get that kind of experience in Vientiane, the capital. But we were travelling through Laos from the west, an unusual way into the country at the moment, and people have not had time to catch up with the ways and opportunities of the falangs, the name for westerners.</p> <p>We flew up to Chiang Rai, in northern Thailand, from Bangkok and took a bus to the frontier town of Chiang Khong, where we bought our visas through an intermediary for $50 each. The next morning, the ferry carrying half-a-dozen backpackers and ourselves edged across the Mekong to Huey Xai. We went through the formalities, exchanged \u00a3100 for a huge wad of 660,000 kips, and got a jumbo to where the fast boats were moored.</p> <p>They were not exaggerating, I thought, as the fast boat rocketed off along the Mekong in the direction of Luang Prabang. The stylish, brightly-painted rowing boat with a car engine bolted on the back was fast - 0-50mph in seconds. Within minutes, the thrill of speed gave way to the interest of river life and the unfolding scenery, jagged hills fading blue to grey, until, thanks to the vagarious nature of the Mekong's course, we arrived at Luang Prabang as the sun set in front of us. From there, it was another 20 miles of dusty roads before we arrived, battered and dishevelled, at the best hotel in town, the Villa Santi, which was once owned by a princess and which is more accustomed to welcoming well-groomed guests who arrive in a limousine from the airport.</p> <p>Laos, like Thailand, is a Theravada Buddhist state: 60% of the population, probably 90% in towns, lives by the dhama, or universal law; the rest are mostly rural hill tribe animists. Luang Prabang, the historic royal city, embodies that Buddhist spirit with its 32 wats - temple complexes - and hundreds of monks and novices. The gentle people live by the same set of beliefs: do good, receive good; do evil, receive evil. It works in a town that practises what Buddha preached.</p> <p>We emerged from the Villa Santi in the mild air of the February morning to explore its historic area between the confluence of the Mekong and Khan rivers. The temples date back to the 16th century but almost every one has been destroyed and rebuilt at some time because of invasions by the Siamese, Chinese, and Burmese, among others. Xieng Thong is the classic Luang Prabang wat, with its distinctive deeply-sloping roofs, its royal funeral chapel (housing an enormous funeral carriage holding royal ashes guarded by a dramatic naga , Buddha's seven-headed serpent so loved by Lao temple designers) and a unique reclining Buddha. We sat in the shade, looking at the chapels and chedis, the ripple of the blossom, and the slow and dignified passage of the monks.</p> <p>Most people who visit Luang Prabang make the journey to the Pak Ou caves, with their 4,000 Buddha images. They tend to travel the 25 miles by boat but we hired a jumbo. It was a hilariously bad ride that we wouldn't have missed and the trip included June, my wife, earning her rice by taking up the good-natured challenge of the women road workers to help dig foundations.</p> <p>Unesco, in its citation for Luang Prabang's elevation to world heritage site (with the consequent inflow of much needed restoration money), said the town uniquely blended Lao and French colonial influences. Its laid-back atmosphere, open-air eating places that lure you into gluttony and the warm people make it easy to simply enjoy the legacy of the past without reflecting on the horrors that the people have seen: from the US bombing campaign to civil war, and the imprisonment and deaths of the king, queen and the last prince less than two decades ago. </p> <p> We left Luang Prabang in a clapped-out coach on the notorious Route 13. The coach was better than the people-carrying truck that was the alternative and it carried a mechanic because everyone, including us, expected it to break down. </p> <p>It did. Twice. The second time, the transmission fell out and the crew worked heroically as nightfall approached. They say Highway 13 is safe now that the army has moved in but until four years ago, Hmong guerrillas were carrying out raids with automatic weapons. We saw no soldiers and heard, while waiting for the bus to be fixed, only the hauntingly beautiful sound of a woman singing as she worked in the wilderness of the high hills. </p> <p>Vang Vieng, two-thirds of the way to Vientiane, must be among the world's most beautiful places. But not when we arrived at midnight with everywhere closed and the streets pitch black. We managed to rouse a family with rooms to let - bed, shower, kindly concern, all for \u00a31.80. </p> <p>The town, which feels more like a village, is built in the sweep of the Nam Song river, with endlessly enticing views towards the horizon of limestone crags and hills. Those hills offer a dozen interesting caves and caverns - we opted for a distant cave and hired a motorised ox-cart. A point at my flip-flops and a universal \"OK?\" brought a warm affirmative from the driver. It wasn't that he didn't understand me: it was just that he thought it was quite OK to climb 650ft up boulders, some sections almost vertical, in flip-flops. But the effort was well rewarded: the great cavern and, in a pale light from a higher opening, a 20ft reclining Buddha. </p> <p>The bus down to Vientiane was crowded. But it did not prepare us for the maelstrom that is the city centre, dusty enough to make breathing difficult with none of the easy-going friendliness of Luang Pra bang. But, beyond the scrum of the centre, there was the charm of gentle places and gentle people. Pha That Luang - the Great Stupa - is where Buddhism and the state fuse, the former legitimising the latter and the whole becoming the symbol of nationhood. Its golden form encodes Buddhist doctrine from statues at ground level to the central spire, a stylised lotus bud symbolising the growth of the person from the mud of ignorance to the sunshine of enlightenment. </p> <p>We climbed the steps into the monument and later sat in the serene, walled grounds for several hours. A monk walked by and smiled; a family was harassed round by a tour guide; a young couple idled away half an hour. But we saw no one else at this, the country's premier monument. </p> <p>The people at Wat Si Muang, the busiest temple in the city, welcomed us during their day of making merit by taking gifts of flowers, incense, candles and fruit. June made merit by releasing two tiny birds from a cage and a young novice gave us bananas and cut coconuts so we could drink the milk from the shells. Si Muang is the temple where people go to make wishes. If their wishes are granted, they must return with gifts of fruit. When we return, we shall take bananas and coconuts to Wat Si Muang. The wish fulfilled and the gift delivered at the same time. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Garuda Indonesian Airways (020 7486 3011) from Gatwick to Bangkok (\u00a3380 return); Thai Airways International (0870 6060911) one-way flight from Bangkok to Chaing Rai (\u00a337.50).</p> <p>Examples of hotel prices (twin/double with shower): Bangkok Royal Hotel, 1300 bahts (\u00a332.50) a night (00 622 222 9111); Chiang Rai Golden Triangle Inn, \u00a315 (053 711339).

      "body": "<p>Heinrich Heine was not being simply poetic when he touched on the stillness of the Rhine in his poem die Lorelei . It is liquid tranquillity as it flows past the Malakoffturm, once the south-bank watchtower over the port of Cologne. </p> <p>The history books say that the river's northern shores provided the natural harbour for vessels calling there in the early 11th century, with development proper starting in the 1500s and flourishing in the 19th century. The city's decline, helped in no small measure by war-time bombardment, was a 20th-century thing. Now the port is on its way back. </p> <p>In November, the Deutsche Sport und Olympia Museum opened on the south bank, although the two subjects sit awkwardly together: one recalls past triumphs with replica trophies, while the other revels in the ethic of participation, charting the development of the Olympic Games, and offers the chance to see extracts from Leni Riefenstahl's six-hour film of the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. </p> <p>While chewing over whether she was a Nazi propagandist or a great artist or, indeed both, I found something far more digestible - the chocolate museum. In battleship grey and shaped like a ship's bridge, this has been incorporated into the harbour's former toll offices. The foyer is full of people scoffing chocolate, lured into the museum by the aroma and the promise of free samples. The museum is a rare beast and so sensual. But then that would tally with the K\u00f6lners, who as Westphalians have a fun-loving streak, a trait viewed as virtually Latinate by their dour political bedfellows, the Nordrheiners. </p> <p>The tribes were wedded after the second world war by the British administrators, a decision that still rankles with many Nordrheiners. Yet the province has survived, and Cologne seems to have recovered its bearings, managing to cultivate an eclectic arts scene. </p> <p>There is a world-class array of 19th- and 20th-century photography at the Agfa Photo-Historama in the Museum Ludwig, as well as the museum's own permanent collection of German expressionism, surrealism and Russian avant-garde. </p> <p>But despite these and other venues such as the Museum f\u00fcr Ostasiatische Kunst and the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, which has paintings from the 13th to the 19th century, Cologne has really never stood out as a \"must visit\" destination in the same way as Munich or Berlin. </p> <p>But change is a coming. Politicians, led by the NRW prime minister Wolfgang Clement, a former journalist, have decided to establish it as Germany's media city. </p> <p>But can a city renowned mainly for its medieval cathedral, Christmas markets, fragrant water and occasional G8 summit take the strain? Definitely. The place teems. There are elegant squares and apartments as well as bars and restaurants, especially around the Belgian Quarter. </p> <p>I hired a Speedstick, the latest \u00fcberconcept collapsible scooter and used my ever-so eco-friendly feet to skate round this trendy enclave of bars, boutiques and minimalist art galleries. </p> <p>With the buzzing zone of shops and caf\u00e9s around Ehrenstrasse, the busy Galleria and Olivandenhof shopping malls and another being built at Friesenplatz, it is booming but still, as K\u00f6lners say, a big village. </p> <p>As a measure of how friendly the locals are, the couple I asked to keep an eye on my coat and more importantly my seat before I fought my way to the bar at Barracuda were on nodding terms with me a few hours later when I bumped into them in nearby Studio 672. </p> <p>Together we battled for space amid the crush of bodies doing their personal things to the electronic beats. Lightweights like me cycled off at dawn while the beat went on and on. </p> <p>But it isn't just the electronic clubs such as Liquid Sky that pound through the night. Visions on the Hohenzollernring keep hip-hop crews well satisfied. And yet the nightlife isn't just a club phenomenon. Step into a bar such as K\u00f6nigswasser at 3am and the place has couples dancing to 1980s soul classics as well as various electronic swirls. Others sit around talking. Gone 4am, as I depart, people are still arriving. </p> <p>Despite the push for a youthful media metropolis, the old ways have not been buried.

      "bodyText": "Heinrich Heine was not being simply poetic when he touched on the stillness of the Rhine in his poem die Lorelei . It is liquid tranquillity as it flows past the Malakoffturm, once the south-bank watchtower over the port of Cologne. The history books say that the river's northern shores provided the natural harbour for vessels calling there in the early 11th century, with development proper starting in the 1500s and flourishing in the 19th century. The city's decline, helped in no small measure by war-time bombardment, was a 20th-century thing. Now the port is on its way back. In November, the Deutsche Sport und Olympia Museum opened on the south bank, although the two subjects sit awkwardly together: one recalls past triumphs with replica trophies, while the other revels in the ethic of participation, charting the development of the Olympic Games, and offers the chance to see extracts from Leni Riefenstahl's six-hour film of the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. While chewing over whether she was a Nazi propagandist or a great artist or, indeed both, I found something far more digestible - the chocolate museum. In battleship grey and shaped like a ship's bridge, this has been incorporated into the harbour's former toll offices. The foyer is full of people scoffing chocolate, lured into the museum by the aroma and the promise of free samples. The museum is a rare beast and so sensual. But then that would tally with the K\u00f6lners, who as Westphalians have a fun-loving streak, a trait viewed as virtually Latinate by their dour political bedfellows, the Nordrheiners. The tribes were wedded after the second world war by the British administrators, a decision that still rankles with many Nordrheiners. Yet the province has survived, and Cologne seems to have recovered its bearings, managing to cultivate an eclectic arts scene. There is a world-class array of 19th- and 20th-century photography at the Agfa Photo-Historama in the Museum Ludwig, as well as the museum's own permanent collection of German expressionism, surrealism and Russian avant-garde. But despite these and other venues such as the Museum f\u00fcr Ostasiatische Kunst and the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, which has paintings from the 13th to the 19th century, Cologne has really never stood out as a \"must visit\" destination in the same way as Munich or Berlin. But change is a coming. Politicians, led by the NRW prime minister Wolfgang Clement, a former journalist, have decided to establish it as Germany's media city. But can a city renowned mainly for its medieval cathedral, Christmas markets, fragrant water and occasional G8 summit take the strain? Definitely. The place teems. There are elegant squares and apartments as well as bars and restaurants, especially around the Belgian Quarter. I hired a Speedstick, the latest \u00fcberconcept collapsible scooter and used my ever-so eco-friendly feet to skate round this trendy enclave of bars, boutiques and minimalist art galleries. With the buzzing zone of shops and caf\u00e9s around Ehrenstrasse, the busy Galleria and Olivandenhof shopping malls and another being built at Friesenplatz, it is booming but still, as K\u00f6lners say, a big village. As a measure of how friendly the locals are, the couple I asked to keep an eye on my coat and more importantly my seat before I fought my way to the bar at Barracuda were on nodding terms with me a few hours later when I bumped into them in nearby Studio 672. Together we battled for space amid the crush of bodies doing their personal things to the electronic beats. Lightweights like me cycled off at dawn while the beat went on and on. But it isn't just the electronic clubs such as Liquid Sky that pound through the night. Visions on the Hohenzollernring keep hip-hop crews well satisfied. And yet the nightlife isn't just a club phenomenon. Step into a bar such as K\u00f6nigswasser at 3am and the place has couples dancing to 1980s soul classics as well as various electronic swirls. Others sit around talking. Gone 4am, as I depart, people are still arriving. Despite the push for a youthful media metropolis, the old ways have not been buried. Most bars serve K\u00f6lsch, a local lager proffered in slim glasses. The quality of this poison varies from bar to bar so, following an insider's tip, I went to its source - the P\u00e4ffgen brewery in Friesenstrasse. Motifs of labourers toiling to take the hops to barns decorated the walls and hearty waiters swooped to conquer my thirst, swiping empty glasses and replacing them with full ones in a flash. Pomp, in Lindenstrasse, serves the traditional Westphalian dish of gr\u00fcnkohl , an honest-smelling mulch of potatoes, onions and kale. While not the prettiest of platters, it is a fitting fuel for climbing the 509 steps into the cathedral spires for sweeping views of the city and the river's peaceful procession into the distance. 5 of the best shops 1 Radfieber Brusseler Strasse 59 Speedsticks and bikes for hire. 2 Kleidermarkt Ehrenstrasse 70-72 Second-hand and new clothes. 3 Kunsthaus Apostelnstrasse 12 Art for sale. 4 Kleidung Brusseler Strasse 90 Three designers.

      "body": "<p>President Yoweri Museveni paused for breath on a path in the middle of the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest as a waiter hurried forward carrying a tin of glucose powder. The 56-year-old head of Uganda carefully took a mouthful before offering the tin to his panting aides, who were bringing up the rear of the 35-person entourage. </p> <p>Dressed in a military uniform bearing his general's pips, the president steadily made his way through the cultivated hills and into the dense forest, where his trackers eventually located a small group of gorillas eating red fruit and rolling on their backs. The silverback, the big male in charge of the group, glared angrily out of the bushes at the intruders. Museveni watched for five minutes, then turned away and went to sit on a drinks cooler that the waiter had stoically carried up the steep forest track. </p> <p>The president had invited me to accompany him on the trek marking the anniversary of the death of eight foreign tourists and one Ugandan park warden at the hands of Rwandan Hutu rebels. The attack attracted international media attention and caused Uganda's tourism industry to collapse. The president wanted to show the world that the area was now safe for tourists to return. </p> <p>Bwindi is in a ravishing part of western Uganda. As the presidential helicopter flew south from Kampala, the land began to crumple into tight green hills. The earth is intensely cultivated with small, rectangular mud houses positioned neatly in the middle of fields of banana trees. On the horizon was a faint blue haze where Uganda blended into Congo. </p> <p>The first hour of the trek was through slopes of coffee and banana plantations. The forest began suddenly at the crest of a hill, and plunged into a valley before stretching off on rolling hills into Congo. We stayed at the crest of the hill for an hour while the trackers tried to locate the gorillas. Mountain gorillas normally don't move more than two kilometres in a day and once the trackers, many of whom are former poachers, have located their nests, they follow their trail of droppings and half-eaten fruit and foliage. </p> <p>Unfortunately, our gorillas had moved two kilometres up the side of another hill, which meant there was a long slog still ahead.We slipped down a muddy slope and there in front of us were two gorillas, with dense, black, glossy fur. They came slowly out of the bush, without fear. Then they climbed a tree directly in front of us and started eating the red fruit. </p> <p>The guides began identifying the animals and making gorilla noises to attract their attention. I was more interested in watching the president who said he liked the forest more than the gorillas. </p> <p>In truth, wildlife viewing is not a very Ugandan enterprise. The people who live around the park in Bwindi tend to look upon gorillas as at worst crop-raiding vermin - they steal bananas - at best a potential form of income: gorilla tourism is arranged so that 12% of permit revenue goes towards building schools and roads in the region, thereby giving locals an incentive not to encroach on or poach in the forest. </p> <p>Before we left, the guides managed to locate more gorillas further down the slope. A baby was playing with his toes and rocking back and forth, a young male and female tussled with each other, the male suddenly giving a not very threatening chest pound. </p> <p>All the time, the silverback sat at the back watching us, his face impassive but his eyes boring through. He was standing guard against potential threat and I felt like an intruder. </p> <p><strong>Out of the mist - the protection of a species</strong></p> <p>Dian Fossey was wrong when she wrote in Gorillas In The Mist in 1983: \"Human beings must decide now whether or not the Mountain Gorilla will be a species discovered and extinct within the same century.\" I have only just returned from both Uganda and Rwanda in the next century. What she underestimated was the extraordinary desire of others to see the gorillas and the global power of the travel industry. </p> <p>Tourism was Rwanda's third largest revenue source after tea and coffee before the genocidal war started in 1994, the vast majority of it focused on one animal, the mountain gorilla. So, too, in Uganda, which after bravely coming back from the Idi Amin and Milton Obote dictatorships, suddenly lost its tourism industry in March last year after the massacre. In today's world of \"rebel guerillas\", there can be few better ways to harm a country than killing some tourists within it. </p> <p>For Uganda, those poor victims, caught in a conflict not of their making, unwittingly cost the country tens of millions of dollars, shook the whole gorilla conservation programme, put hundreds of people out of irreplaceable jobs and nearly bankrupt the Uganda Wildlife Service. </p> <p>For the crux of it is that a gorilla-tracking permit had made saving gorillas an economic necessity for Rwanda and Uganda. Just three habituated gorilla groups of about 38 individuals in total could generate over US$3m in revenue a year, making each individual worth nearly US$90,000 a year to Uganda. In fact, the permit fees had in past years allowed for vast swathes of both countries to be preserved, even if few people even saw these other wildlands. It was, and still is, a tourism success story. </p> <p>Apart from preserving these lands for rich foreigners to enjoy, other less obvious but no less tangible benefits have been extended to the locals. For forests and mountains are the very basis of our natural life support processes. Their worth as water suppliers, water purification services, medicine chests and food sources in a country that can't afford the most basic services is incalculable. </p> <p>Travel to Uganda or Rwanda today and you will see how much they value mountain gorillas. Whole army brigades are garrisoned around parks, squadrons of AK47-wielding soldiers escort you gorilla-tracking in the mountains and Russian tanks point their guns menacingly into impenetrable jungle. Only a few years ago, such security to protect a few furry animals would have been inconceivable, but today it is as essential as protecting a major oil refinery. </p> <p>At last the vital economics of conservation have started working and for those of us privileged enough to be able to travel to such places, what is the price of a permit for an experience unlike any other will have - in the natural world at least.</p> <p>\u0095 Julian Matthews is founder director of Travel for Conservation tour operator, Discovery Initiatives.</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Encounter (020 7370 6845) organises 6 night gorilla safaris.

The people who live around the park in Bwindi tend to look upon gorillas as at worst crop-raiding vermin - they steal bananas - at best a potential form of income: gorilla tourism is arranged so that 12% of permit revenue goes towards building schools and roads in the region, thereby giving locals an incentive not to encroach on or poach in the forest. Before we left, the guides managed to locate more gorillas further down the slope. A baby was playing with his toes and rocking back and forth, a young male and female tussled with each other, the male suddenly giving a not very threatening chest pound. All the time, the silverback sat at the back watching us, his face impassive but his eyes boring through. He was standing guard against potential threat and I felt like an intruder. Out of the mist - the protection of a species Dian Fossey was wrong when she wrote in Gorillas In The Mist in 1983: \"Human beings must decide now whether or not the Mountain Gorilla will be a species discovered and extinct within the same century.\" I have only just returned from both Uganda and Rwanda in the next century. What she underestimated was the extraordinary desire of others to see the gorillas and the global power of the travel industry. Tourism was Rwanda's third largest revenue source after tea and coffee before the genocidal war started in 1994, the vast majority of it focused on one animal, the mountain gorilla. So, too, in Uganda, which after bravely coming back from the Idi Amin and Milton Obote dictatorships, suddenly lost its tourism industry in March last year after the massacre. In today's world of \"rebel guerillas\", there can be few better ways to harm a country than killing some tourists within it. For Uganda, those poor victims, caught in a conflict not of their making, unwittingly cost the country tens of millions of dollars, shook the whole gorilla conservation programme, put hundreds of people out of irreplaceable jobs and nearly bankrupt the Uganda Wildlife Service. For the crux of it is that a gorilla-tracking permit had made saving gorillas an economic necessity for Rwanda and Uganda. Just three habituated gorilla groups of about 38 individuals in total could generate over US$3m in revenue a year, making each individual worth nearly US$90,000 a year to Uganda. In fact, the permit fees had in past years allowed for vast swathes of both countries to be preserved, even if few people even saw these other wildlands. It was, and still is, a tourism success story. Apart from preserving these lands for rich foreigners to enjoy, other less obvious but no less tangible benefits have been extended to the locals. For forests and mountains are the very basis of our natural life support processes. Their worth as water suppliers, water purification services, medicine chests and food sources in a country that can't afford the most basic services is incalculable. Travel to Uganda or Rwanda today and you will see how much they value mountain gorillas. Whole army brigades are garrisoned around parks, squadrons of AK47-wielding soldiers escort you gorilla-tracking in the mountains and Russian tanks point their guns menacingly into impenetrable jungle. Only a few years ago, such security to protect a few furry animals would have been inconceivable, but today it is as essential as protecting a major oil refinery. At last the vital economics of conservation have started working and for those of us privileged enough to be able to travel to such places, what is the price of a permit for an experience unlike any other will have - in the natural world at least. \u0095 Julian Matthews is founder director of Travel for Conservation tour operator, Discovery Initiatives. The practicals Encounter (020 7370 6845) organises 6 night gorilla safaris. Travle is in small groups, accompanied by experienced local guides. An hour is spent in close quarters with the animals in their natural habitat. The cost is \u00a3295, excluding flights, plus the cost of a gorilla permit, payable locally at an approximate cost of \u00a3154. Camping accomodation, food and guides are all included. Return flights to Kampala can be arranged from \u00a3500. Departure dates July 10, August 14, September 18, October 23 and November 27. Discovery Initiatives (020 7924 5696) has 15 day trips taking in Kampala and national parks and forests in Uganda and Rwanda. It includes four separate opportunities to view gorillas. Prices are from \u00a33150 per person, including international flights, all accomodation, meals, park fees, transport, leader and guides and two gorilla permits. Departure September 3.",

The island is too mountainous to build roads across it. </p> <p>What I love about Kodiak is the extraordinary remoteness. It takes days to get there from London and, by the time you arrive, you feel as if you have gone to a very different world. It is dotted with salmon canneries, fishing and bear-watching lodges and just a few people living in the middle of absolutely nowhere. I really had a sense that nothing had changed since the war. </p> <p>The flying boats always took me to weird and wonderful places that seemed exclusive to Kodiak. On one occasion, the pilot decided that because we were early on a flight, we should go fishing.

      "bodyText": "I went to Kodiak Island in Alaska because it is the last place where you can travel in Goose flying boats from 50-odd years ago. The island is too mountainous to build roads across it. What I love about Kodiak is the extraordinary remoteness. It takes days to get there from London and, by the time you arrive, you feel as if you have gone to a very different world. It is dotted with salmon canneries, fishing and bear-watching lodges and just a few people living in the middle of absolutely nowhere. I really had a sense that nothing had changed since the war. The flying boats always took me to weird and wonderful places that seemed exclusive to Kodiak. On one occasion, the pilot decided that because we were early on a flight, we should go fishing. He pointed out a lake and we dropped down, parked the Goose, got out our fishing rods and caught 15lb salmon. It was completely silent except for the cry of a couple of bald eagles above. The scenery was varied, from dark pine forests in the north to the bleakness of the south. Rivers teem with salmon and ducks and you can see brown bears. It is not a place that attracts tourists because it is so inaccessible and expensive, but I would love to go back and would recommend anyone to have the experience of flying around in a 50-year-old aeroplane. \u0095 Corsairville, The Lost Domain Of The Flying Boat, by Graham Coster, is published by Viking at \u00a316.99.",

A welcoming signpost, meanwhile, urges tourists in one of Britain's smallest cities to \"stay awhile amid its ancient charms\". </p> <p>The old-versus-new symbolism is not lost on local parents who are battling to close the North Yorkshire city's grammar school - the oldest in England - and convert it into a comprehensive. They will finally learn whether they have been successful next Friday evening, when the result of a vote among some 3,000 eligible parents who have children at the city's primary schools is announced by the Electoral Reform Society in a test case for the rest of the country. They are bracing themselves for defeat. </p> <p>Ripon is the first area where anti-grammar campaigners have successfully forced a ballot under controversial legislation introduced by Labour in 1998 which allows parents to determine the fate of Britain's 166 surviving state-maintained grammar schools. The campaign is being led by the Ripon branch of the Campaign for State Education, which has been fighting for many years to end selection. It took the group around five months to secure the 20% of parental support - 587 signatures - to stage a ballot. </p> <p>If it wins the vote, the school - founded in 1555 - would be required to scrap its 11-plus test from September 2002 and admit pupils of all abilities. </p> <p>The North Yorkshire local education authority has been vague about what would replace the grammar school, although it has promised a review of secondary education which would lead to reorganisation. But if, as seems more likely, the vote is lost, the pro-comprehensive campaigners will have the opportunity to return to their cause in five years and force another ballot. </p> <p>The issue has split Ripon, where the grammar school and Ripon College - the local comprehensive - face each other across a main road. But it has not divided the commu nity along the lines that might have been expected. The anti-grammar campaigners, for example, include grammar-educated parents whose children benefit from education at the grammar school, but who believe selection is divisive and limits potential. </p> <p>This is well-heeled Conservative heartland, yet the pro-grammar campaigners include Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters as well as Tories. Some families have found themselves with one child at the grammar and one at Ripon College. </p> <p>Emotions have been highly charged and came to a head earlier this week when a planned radio debate on BBC Radio York was cancelled after the pro-grammar school camp - known as the Ripon Secondary Schools Partnership - refused to take part. The Campaign for State Education was bitterly disappointed. It had hoped that a public airing of the issues might remind tardy parents to send off their voting forms before the ballot closes next week. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the heads and teachers of the two schools - who are forbidden by law from taking a stand on the issue - have kept out of the limelight. But the heads are known to want to preserve the status quo. </p> <p>Alan Jones, headmaster of the grammar school, said the message from both schools was that it was business as usual. \"We've had to conduct business in distracting times, and I think our parents have appreciated that.\" </p> <p>His school creams off the brightest 30% of local children, while the rest either attend Ripon College or are sent by bus to comprehensive schools outside the area. Ripon grammar school is one of three selective grammar schools in North Yorkshire which feature consistently at the top of the region's performance league tables. The school's academic record is impeccable - all its pupils pass at least five good GCSEs at grades A to C - while 96% of sixth-formers go on to university. </p> <p>The debate has been compounded by the improving fortunes of the 470-pupil Ripon College. Under the headship of Paul Lowery, the number of pupils getting five GCSEs at grades A to C has risen from 8% to 20% per cent and is on target for 22% this year. The award of technology status last month brings new funding of \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3123 per student per year. </p> <p>A partnership forged between Mr Jones and Mr Lowery means that for the first time this year sixth-formers from the two schools will share lessons and facilities. </p> <p>The local Conservative MP, David Curry - a former Ripon grammar head boy - said: \"It is not just about saving the grammar school. It is about making sure we get good quality secondary education which serves Ripon best. The two schools have strong individual identities and are working very well together - why throw that away?\" </p> <p>Debbie Atkins, who sent two of her three daughters to a comprehensive in Harrogate rather than enter them for the 11-plus, said: \"Why should children feel they are on the scrapheap because they have failed? </p> <p>\"And is it fair that Ripon should suffer as a community because 35% of its children are being bussed out of the area?\" </p> <p><strong>Pressure from Parents</strong></p> <p>Petitions to abolish selection in several other parts of the country are already under way - all involving much larger electorates than Ripon - although none has yet reached the required level of 20% of parental support. </p> <p>The department for education said it had so far set the following thresholds for signatures as a result of requests from local parents: </p> <p><strong> London borough of Barnet: </strong> 7,209 signatures needed. </p> <p><strong> Birmingham:</strong> two groups of schools, one group requiring 4,441 signatures and the other 10,728. </p> <p><strong> Trafford</strong> in Greater Manchester: 8,518. </p> <p><strong> Kent:</strong> 45,959. </p> <p><strong> London borough of Sutton:</strong> 7,375. </p> <p>In the <strong> London borough of</strong> <strong> Enfield </strong> the department has received a request for a threshold to be set in the case of the Latymer School. </p> <p> Parents can get a more details from the department's publications centre by quoting ref.Gramguide.

If it wins the vote, the school - founded in 1555 - would be required to scrap its 11-plus test from September 2002 and admit pupils of all abilities. The North Yorkshire local education authority has been vague about what would replace the grammar school, although it has promised a review of secondary education which would lead to reorganisation. But if, as seems more likely, the vote is lost, the pro-comprehensive campaigners will have the opportunity to return to their cause in five years and force another ballot. The issue has split Ripon, where the grammar school and Ripon College - the local comprehensive - face each other across a main road. But it has not divided the commu nity along the lines that might have been expected. The anti-grammar campaigners, for example, include grammar-educated parents whose children benefit from education at the grammar school, but who believe selection is divisive and limits potential. This is well-heeled Conservative heartland, yet the pro-grammar campaigners include Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters as well as Tories. Some families have found themselves with one child at the grammar and one at Ripon College. Emotions have been highly charged and came to a head earlier this week when a planned radio debate on BBC Radio York was cancelled after the pro-grammar school camp - known as the Ripon Secondary Schools Partnership - refused to take part. The Campaign for State Education was bitterly disappointed. It had hoped that a public airing of the issues might remind tardy parents to send off their voting forms before the ballot closes next week. Meanwhile, the heads and teachers of the two schools - who are forbidden by law from taking a stand on the issue - have kept out of the limelight. But the heads are known to want to preserve the status quo. Alan Jones, headmaster of the grammar school, said the message from both schools was that it was business as usual. \"We've had to conduct business in distracting times, and I think our parents have appreciated that.\" His school creams off the brightest 30% of local children, while the rest either attend Ripon College or are sent by bus to comprehensive schools outside the area. Ripon grammar school is one of three selective grammar schools in North Yorkshire which feature consistently at the top of the region's performance league tables. The school's academic record is impeccable - all its pupils pass at least five good GCSEs at grades A to C - while 96% of sixth-formers go on to university. The debate has been compounded by the improving fortunes of the 470-pupil Ripon College. Under the headship of Paul Lowery, the number of pupils getting five GCSEs at grades A to C has risen from 8% to 20% per cent and is on target for 22% this year. The award of technology status last month brings new funding of \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3123 per student per year. A partnership forged between Mr Jones and Mr Lowery means that for the first time this year sixth-formers from the two schools will share lessons and facilities. The local Conservative MP, David Curry - a former Ripon grammar head boy - said: \"It is not just about saving the grammar school. It is about making sure we get good quality secondary education which serves Ripon best. The two schools have strong individual identities and are working very well together - why throw that away?\" Debbie Atkins, who sent two of her three daughters to a comprehensive in Harrogate rather than enter them for the 11-plus, said: \"Why should children feel they are on the scrapheap because they have failed? \"And is it fair that Ripon should suffer as a community because 35% of its children are being bussed out of the area?\" Pressure from Parents Petitions to abolish selection in several other parts of the country are already under way - all involving much larger electorates than Ripon - although none has yet reached the required level of 20% of parental support. The department for education said it had so far set the following thresholds for signatures as a result of requests from local parents: London borough of Barnet: 7,209 signatures needed. Birmingham: two groups of schools, one group requiring 4,441 signatures and the other 10,728. Trafford in Greater Manchester: 8,518. Kent: 45,959. London borough of Sutton: 7,375. In the London borough of Enfield the department has received a request for a threshold to be set in the case of the Latymer School.

      "body": "<p>The message is crackling over the radio. It is spoken in Shangaan, the language of the rangers who guide the open-topped Land Rovers across the 600km of road around the Sabi Sands Game Park. A female leopard has been spotted (pun not intended), and she appears to be stalking something. </p> <p>This is too good an opportunity to miss. We are told that even sighting a leopard is a remote possibility, as there are only six in the game park. A leopard making a \"kill\" had been seen only once by the park ranger. </p> <p>It means going through the undergrowth of the park, and this could be very dangerous. There is a rule when out spotting big game that you should never break the shape of the Land Rover by standing up. Evidently, the animals think the Land Rover is another animal, and to break the shape is to warn some very dangerous ones that you are foe. They might charge - or worse. </p> <p>We drive as fast as we can through the labyrinth of trees and bushes, which become more hazardous the deeper we enter. The radio sizzles into life again, informing us that the female leopard is still in position, and that she is definitely stalking something, although what it is no one can see. She won't stay for much longer and time for us is running out. We drive as fast as safety will allow. </p> <p>And then we see her. My first sighting of a leopard. She is no more than 50ft from me. My God, she is huge! My God, she is beautiful. </p> <p>There are five of us in the Land Rover. I am positioned in the passenger seat. Behind me sit Michael Thompson Noel and Nigel Dempster, the gossip columnist. Both look apprehensive as they stare into the eyes of this leopard. For Dempster, this is far removed from stalking celebrities. </p> <p>As the Land Rover edges nearer, so we might have a close up of the \"kill\", there is a loud explosion as if someone has fired a high-powered rifle at us. The leopard is startled. A sharp tree stump has gone through the side wall of our front nearside tyre. The air whooshes out and the Land Rover has tipped to an angle of 45 degrees. </p> <p>What are we to do? Dyke, our ranger, is asked to very carefully leave his car seat, move gingerly around to the rear of the Land Rover and release the spare tyre. It is getting dark. Dyke is plainly frightened. </p> <p>Darren, our driver, then carefully stands up. \"Where are you going?\" I ask. </p> <p>\"I'm getting out to jack up the vehicle,\" he says. </p> <p>\"But what about the leopard?\" </p> <p>Darren takes the rifle from the dashboard of the car, loads three copper-tipped bullets and hands me the gun. </p> <p>The leopard moves closer towards the two men, now out of the vehicle. Dyke and Darren have most definitely \"broken the shape\" and the leopard is aware of it. Whatever the leopard is stalking might not be as appetising and easy a target as our driver and ranger. </p> <p>Darren instructs me: \"If it comes any closer than 15ft, fire a bullet into the air. It should frighten her off. If she keeps on coming, then aim between her eyes. It would break my heart to shoot a leopard, but it's her or us.\" </p> <p>The leopard is perfectly still, and then instead of coming any closer to us, she pounces on to the neck of a baby impala and a scream shrieks out into the twilight. I don't have to fire a shot. The Land Rover is jacked up. The tyre is changed. The blood returns to Dempster's face. </p> <p>I suppose not all wild game adventures are as this one. How could they be? But isn't this what going on safari is all about? </p> <p>I am staying at the Ulusaba Rock Lodge, situated on the cliff face of the Ulusaba mountain, 800ft above sea level, overlooking a wilderness below that is the size of Wales. From up here, I am able to look over a landscape that I had previously only ever imagined: bush as far as the eye can see, with light orange tracks that are the roads that will take us in search of wild game. </p> <p>I consider that it is the size, the wide open space, the noise of the bush that made the British settle here in another time. But I mustn't overlook the unadulterated luxury of this marvellous hotel high above the game reserve, for I would not associate this level of luxury with the African bush. </p> <p>Ulusaba Rock Lodge is perhaps best described as Hollywood in the Bush. This is really what Meryl Streep would expect before she started the morning's filming on Out Of Africa. This is the resort that makes you feel like a Hollywood star. </p> <p>You see, Ulusaba Rock Lodge is one of an exclusive collection of unique hotels that have been personally selected by Richard Branson. When I am shown to my room, known as the Zulu Room, I ask why there isn't a picture of Stanley Baker or Michael Caine to be seen anywhere, But I have to admit that the Zulu Room did scream Africa at me, with the bed covered in a zebra-skin, furnishings by African Habitat, and above my four-poster bed, draped with a mosquito net, was a pair of horns from a, well, I don't know whence they came. </p> <p>I wander around the grounds. Past the 11 air-conditioned rooms - which means that there will never be more than 22 people up at this Lodge at any one time - I am making the difficult decision as to whether I go on the walking bush trails, or to make the 4.30am start in the Land Rover. I am determined to see the Big Five, which Ulusaba promises can be done if you're very lucky: rhino, buffalo, lion, elephant and leopard. Well, I certainly saw a leopard. </p> <p>No, it's the Land Rover for me. So it's to be an early dinner if I am to be up before the lark. Dinner is taken communally in the Rock Lodge's baronial dining room. All 22 guests dine together around a table laid with the most delicious salads, meats, fish, vegetables you could wish for. This \"let's all muck in together\" policy is a good one, for someone at table might be the person who saves your life when out in the bush - as Dempster will testify. </p> <p>All of us sit in high-backed chairs, atop of each are matching antlers. I don't suppose Branson intends us to take this style - Jungle Baroque is what I name it - seriously. But then why should we? One doesn't come to Ulusaba to be serious. The wine list though is more than a little serious. I know my South African wines, and I can say without fear of contradiction that what is served at Ulusaba is the finest South Africa has to offer. But I must go easy, I have a 4.30am start in the morning. </p> <p>After dinner, declining the ports and cognacs (which with food and wines are included in the price), I wander down the hill from Rock Lodge to Safari Lodge. Here I find a romantic, tree-house-style lodge nestling in the Riverine bush, under a canopy of trees. This lodge borders the Mabrak River, and stands almost next door to a watering hole (for the animals), so big game can be seen from the viewing deck. I give way to temptation as I sit down here with a glass of Veuve Cliquot, chewing Biltong, watching rhinos taking an early evening drink, and thinking this is all so surreal but all so wonderful. </p> <p>The next morning I am in the bush by 5am, when the nocturnal animals are just returning home from their night shift. During this four-hour early morning ride around the park, I see and photograph a hyena, antelope, giraffe, warthog, cheetah, as well as the big four - winter is the wrong time of the year for buffalo, I am informed. I am so impressed by this safari that I put my name down for the early evening tour. On this, I sit for nearly 45 minutes and watch a white rhino, no further than 10ft from me, eating his evening meal. He sees me. I am no threat to him. He is beautiful. How sad that this species is being killed for its horn, and that in time the white rhino will be nothing more than a memory. </p> <p>And it is as we are photographing this powerful beast that the message comes through on the radio that a female leopard has been sighted and the real African adventure is about to begin. </p> <p>While here, I read JB Priestley, who writes: \"A good holiday is one spent among people whose notions of time are vaguer than yours.\" And here at Ulusaba nobody seems to care about time. The staff are my type of people. Africa is my type of country. Ulusaba Rock Lodge is my type of resort. I don't care that everything seems as if we are in a Hollywood film set. Here I know I will eat well, drink well, be pampered and still feel as though I am Ernest Hemingway. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Ulusaba Rock Lodge and Safari Lodge can be booked for individuals and parties, or for exclusive use. Prices start at \u00a3405 a day at Rock Lodge and \u00a3200 at Safari Lodge. Rates include accomodation, all meals and drinks, twice daily game viewing drives, use of gym, pool and tennis courts.

The radio sizzles into life again, informing us that the female leopard is still in position, and that she is definitely stalking something, although what it is no one can see. She won't stay for much longer and time for us is running out. We drive as fast as safety will allow. And then we see her. My first sighting of a leopard. She is no more than 50ft from me. My God, she is huge! My God, she is beautiful. There are five of us in the Land Rover. I am positioned in the passenger seat. Behind me sit Michael Thompson Noel and Nigel Dempster, the gossip columnist. Both look apprehensive as they stare into the eyes of this leopard. For Dempster, this is far removed from stalking celebrities. As the Land Rover edges nearer, so we might have a close up of the \"kill\", there is a loud explosion as if someone has fired a high-powered rifle at us. The leopard is startled. A sharp tree stump has gone through the side wall of our front nearside tyre. The air whooshes out and the Land Rover has tipped to an angle of 45 degrees. What are we to do? Dyke, our ranger, is asked to very carefully leave his car seat, move gingerly around to the rear of the Land Rover and release the spare tyre. It is getting dark. Dyke is plainly frightened. Darren, our driver, then carefully stands up. \"Where are you going?\" I ask. \"I'm getting out to jack up the vehicle,\" he says. \"But what about the leopard?\" Darren takes the rifle from the dashboard of the car, loads three copper-tipped bullets and hands me the gun. The leopard moves closer towards the two men, now out of the vehicle. Dyke and Darren have most definitely \"broken the shape\" and the leopard is aware of it. Whatever the leopard is stalking might not be as appetising and easy a target as our driver and ranger. Darren instructs me: \"If it comes any closer than 15ft, fire a bullet into the air. It should frighten her off. If she keeps on coming, then aim between her eyes. It would break my heart to shoot a leopard, but it's her or us.\" The leopard is perfectly still, and then instead of coming any closer to us, she pounces on to the neck of a baby impala and a scream shrieks out into the twilight. I don't have to fire a shot. The Land Rover is jacked up. The tyre is changed. The blood returns to Dempster's face. I suppose not all wild game adventures are as this one. How could they be? But isn't this what going on safari is all about? I am staying at the Ulusaba Rock Lodge, situated on the cliff face of the Ulusaba mountain, 800ft above sea level, overlooking a wilderness below that is the size of Wales. From up here, I am able to look over a landscape that I had previously only ever imagined: bush as far as the eye can see, with light orange tracks that are the roads that will take us in search of wild game. I consider that it is the size, the wide open space, the noise of the bush that made the British settle here in another time. But I mustn't overlook the unadulterated luxury of this marvellous hotel high above the game reserve, for I would not associate this level of luxury with the African bush. Ulusaba Rock Lodge is perhaps best described as Hollywood in the Bush. This is really what Meryl Streep would expect before she started the morning's filming on Out Of Africa. This is the resort that makes you feel like a Hollywood star. You see, Ulusaba Rock Lodge is one of an exclusive collection of unique hotels that have been personally selected by Richard Branson. When I am shown to my room, known as the Zulu Room, I ask why there isn't a picture of Stanley Baker or Michael Caine to be seen anywhere, But I have to admit that the Zulu Room did scream Africa at me, with the bed covered in a zebra-skin, furnishings by African Habitat, and above my four-poster bed, draped with a mosquito net, was a pair of horns from a, well, I don't know whence they came. I wander around the grounds. Past the 11 air-conditioned rooms - which means that there will never be more than 22 people up at this Lodge at any one time - I am making the difficult decision as to whether I go on the walking bush trails, or to make the 4.30am start in the Land Rover. I am determined to see the Big Five, which Ulusaba promises can be done if you're very lucky: rhino, buffalo, lion, elephant and leopard. Well, I certainly saw a leopard. No, it's the Land Rover for me. So it's to be an early dinner if I am to be up before the lark. Dinner is taken communally in the Rock Lodge's baronial dining room. All 22 guests dine together around a table laid with the most delicious salads, meats, fish, vegetables you could wish for. This \"let's all muck in together\" policy is a good one, for someone at table might be the person who saves your life when out in the bush - as Dempster will testify. All of us sit in high-backed chairs, atop of each are matching antlers. I don't suppose Branson intends us to take this style - Jungle Baroque is what I name it - seriously. But then why should we? One doesn't come to Ulusaba to be serious. The wine list though is more than a little serious. I know my South African wines, and I can say without fear of contradiction that what is served at Ulusaba is the finest South Africa has to offer. But I must go easy, I have a 4.30am start in the morning. After dinner, declining the ports and cognacs (which with food and wines are included in the price), I wander down the hill from Rock Lodge to Safari Lodge. Here I find a romantic, tree-house-style lodge nestling in the Riverine bush, under a canopy of trees. This lodge borders the Mabrak River, and stands almost next door to a watering hole (for the animals), so big game can be seen from the viewing deck. I give way to temptation as I sit down here with a glass of Veuve Cliquot, chewing Biltong, watching rhinos taking an early evening drink, and thinking this is all so surreal but all so wonderful. The next morning I am in the bush by 5am, when the nocturnal animals are just returning home from their night shift. During this four-hour early morning ride around the park, I see and photograph a hyena, antelope, giraffe, warthog, cheetah, as well as the big four - winter is the wrong time of the year for buffalo, I am informed. I am so impressed by this safari that I put my name down for the early evening tour. On this, I sit for nearly 45 minutes and watch a white rhino, no further than 10ft from me, eating his evening meal. He sees me. I am no threat to him. He is beautiful. How sad that this species is being killed for its horn, and that in time the white rhino will be nothing more than a memory. And it is as we are photographing this powerful beast that the message comes through on the radio that a female leopard has been sighted and the real African adventure is about to begin. While here, I read JB Priestley, who writes: \"A good holiday is one spent among people whose notions of time are vaguer than yours.\" And here at Ulusaba nobody seems to care about time. The staff are my type of people. Africa is my type of country. Ulusaba Rock Lodge is my type of resort. I don't care that everything seems as if we are in a Hollywood film set. Here I know I will eat well, drink well, be pampered and still feel as though I am Ernest Hemingway. The practicals Ulusaba Rock Lodge and Safari Lodge can be booked for individuals and parties, or for exclusive use. Prices start at \u00a3405 a day at Rock Lodge and \u00a3200 at Safari Lodge. Rates include accomodation, all meals and drinks, twice daily game viewing drives, use of gym, pool and tennis courts. Details from Limited Edition by Virgin (020 7313 6110) .",

Merrick re-creates the colonial story of fall and redemption with bravura, though the balancing act between Walter's stylishly imagined near future and Freyn's memories of the past tilts in favour of Freyn's more gripping tale.

Carl Mix has ruined his family by turning them into a cartoon strip of all-American cute, comic kids. The reality, of course, is that the Mixes are all mixed up and warped by their famous alter egos. After Mix's death his estate is divided between four of the children. Tim, the fifth, gets the poisoned chalice - give up his installation art and carry on the strip for Dad. Coming to terms with growing up, the family and the choice between selling out or staying credible and miserable is the backbone of this wry comedy.</p> <p><strong>Mizora, A World of Women</strong><br>Mary E Bradley Lane <br>University of Nebraska Press, \u00a36.95<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502334053,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>In 1880, when the Cincinnati Commercial newspaper serialised this feminist utopian novel, ideas such as universal free education, a world where class has no meaning and where women are freed from domestic labour were revolutionary. Much of the description of Mizora still sounds radical, though one might well blanch at blonde, blue-eyed maidens ruling the world and eating chemically created food. You can read it as a fun exercise from the genesis of the sci-fi genre, as a serious piece of feminist writing or as an historical curiosity whose central peculiarity is that its author kept her writing a secret from her husband.</p>",

Merrick re-creates the colonial story of fall and redemption with bravura, though the balancing act between Walter's stylishly imagined near future and Freyn's memories of the past tilts in favour of Freyn's more gripping tale. But this is a sophisticated debut and Freyn a compelling central character. The Funnies J Robert Lennon Granta, \u00a36.99 Buy it at BOL Better than your average dysfunctional-family narrative, The Funnies has a neat plot line and some fine descriptions of New Jersey living. Carl Mix has ruined his family by turning them into a cartoon strip of all-American cute, comic kids. The reality, of course, is that the Mixes are all mixed up and warped by their famous alter egos. After Mix's death his estate is divided between four of the children. Tim, the fifth, gets the poisoned chalice - give up his installation art and carry on the strip for Dad. Coming to terms with growing up, the family and the choice between selling out or staying credible and miserable is the backbone of this wry comedy. Mizora, A World of Women Mary E Bradley Lane University of Nebraska Press, \u00a36.95 Buy it at BOL In 1880, when the Cincinnati Commercial newspaper serialised this feminist utopian novel, ideas such as universal free education, a world where class has no meaning and where women are freed from domestic labour were revolutionary. Much of the description of Mizora still sounds radical, though one might well blanch at blonde, blue-eyed maidens ruling the world and eating chemically created food. You can read it as a fun exercise from the genesis of the sci-fi genre, as a serious piece of feminist writing or as an historical curiosity whose central peculiarity is that its author kept her writing a secret from her husband.",

      "body": "<p><strong>New Labour, New Language?</strong><br>Norman Fairclough<br>Routledge, \u00a39.99, 192pp</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502331971,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,142560,00.html\">Read an extract</a></p> <p>The main explicit claim of this book is that Tony Blair and New Labour are taking the marketing or merchandising of politics further than ever before; the main implicit claim is that this takes them - and our politics - further away from truth and honesty.</p> <p>In the course of his researches, Norman Fairclough, professor of language in social life at Lancaster University, counts up the number of times particular words are used in a computerised corpus of speeches, manifestos, Green Papers and whatnot. Among his findings is the news - hardly earthshaking - that the word \"values\" turns up 64 times, but never in the collocation \"socialist values\". </p> <p>We are enlightened about the populist use of the glottal stop; also about Blair's poetics, exemplified by his recollection of London's Gower Street transfigured by crowds as he made his way to Buckingham Palace after the 1997 election.</p> <p>For much of the book we hear of New Labour's third way, and of a good deal else, as \"discourse\". But we are not to be so mundane as to take discourse to be a stretch of speaking or writing. It is, or it has to do with, a representation or vision of the world as it is and should be. Government is not only involved in discourse, but is itself discourse. It is only moderately reassuring to hear, late in the book, that when an army's artillery levels a village it is not just discourse.</p> <p>It is pretty easy to put up with this advanced thinking because the book is also cogent. There are excellent reflections on Blair's rhetoric in his sincere and perfect words to Diana, Princess of Wales's sons after her death. Other reflections in the book also carry conviction. It is indeed a little crooked for New Labour to go on endlessly about how it will simultaneously achieve things that, in an ordinary understanding, cannot go together - the free market and social justice, for instance.</p> <p>Our author does not tolerate the hypocritical pretence of this government, as of almost all governments, that what it wants is a necessity and that nothing else is possible. It isn't just political realism but also managerial politics to run together the inevitability of globalisation with the inevitability of neoliberal globalisation.</p> <p>There is deception by omission in using such nouns as \"global change\" while leaving out the principal agents of that change, the multi-nationals. It's not forces and economic tides, but boards of directors making money, who are responsible for other people having McJobs.</p> <p>Does this sort of thing establish that along with New Labour we have a new language - in the sense both that it has more to do with marketing than what went before and that it is further from truth and honesty?</p> <p>New Labour has indeed been getting too close to the creativity of advertising, as against the intelligence of a good essay or a frank conversation. It is not as straight as Michael Foot. But for me it is no further into falsehood and lies than the governments that went before it.</p> <p>Mrs Thatcher playing St Francis of Assisi comes to mind, as does the role in a lying election of her party chairman Chris Patten, now wonderfully rehabilitated. But it does seem more the case with New Labour than with its predecessors that its policies are talked into being in TV interviews and the like. Whether something becomes a commitment, or a commitment for a while, turns importantly on what it sounds like. </p> <p>But there is some hope to be had in the fact that New Labour is no settled thing. The party may grow averse to going so much by the sounds of things: it can make you ratty at the despatch box, and it doesn't make for a good life, even with the chauffeurs. Clear truth can turn out to be worth something.</p> <p>This is a real book, not written by a spin doctor. Read it and worry. Read it and hope.</p> <p>\u0095 Ted Honderich is a professor of philosophy at University College, London.</p>",

      "bodyText": "New Labour, New Language? Norman Fairclough Routledge, \u00a39.99, 192pp Buy it at BOL Read an extract The main explicit claim of this book is that Tony Blair and New Labour are taking the marketing or merchandising of politics further than ever before; the main implicit claim is that this takes them - and our politics - further away from truth and honesty. In the course of his researches, Norman Fairclough, professor of language in social life at Lancaster University, counts up the number of times particular words are used in a computerised corpus of speeches, manifestos, Green Papers and whatnot. Among his findings is the news - hardly earthshaking - that the word \"values\" turns up 64 times, but never in the collocation \"socialist values\". We are enlightened about the populist use of the glottal stop; also about Blair's poetics, exemplified by his recollection of London's Gower Street transfigured by crowds as he made his way to Buckingham Palace after the 1997 election. For much of the book we hear of New Labour's third way, and of a good deal else, as \"discourse\". But we are not to be so mundane as to take discourse to be a stretch of speaking or writing. It is, or it has to do with, a representation or vision of the world as it is and should be. Government is not only involved in discourse, but is itself discourse. It is only moderately reassuring to hear, late in the book, that when an army's artillery levels a village it is not just discourse. It is pretty easy to put up with this advanced thinking because the book is also cogent. There are excellent reflections on Blair's rhetoric in his sincere and perfect words to Diana, Princess of Wales's sons after her death. Other reflections in the book also carry conviction. It is indeed a little crooked for New Labour to go on endlessly about how it will simultaneously achieve things that, in an ordinary understanding, cannot go together - the free market and social justice, for instance. Our author does not tolerate the hypocritical pretence of this government, as of almost all governments, that what it wants is a necessity and that nothing else is possible. It isn't just political realism but also managerial politics to run together the inevitability of globalisation with the inevitability of neoliberal globalisation. There is deception by omission in using such nouns as \"global change\" while leaving out the principal agents of that change, the multi-nationals. It's not forces and economic tides, but boards of directors making money, who are responsible for other people having McJobs. Does this sort of thing establish that along with New Labour we have a new language - in the sense both that it has more to do with marketing than what went before and that it is further from truth and honesty? New Labour has indeed been getting too close to the creativity of advertising, as against the intelligence of a good essay or a frank conversation. It is not as straight as Michael Foot. But for me it is no further into falsehood and lies than the governments that went before it. Mrs Thatcher playing St Francis of Assisi comes to mind, as does the role in a lying election of her party chairman Chris Patten, now wonderfully rehabilitated. But it does seem more the case with New Labour than with its predecessors that its policies are talked into being in TV interviews and the like. Whether something becomes a commitment, or a commitment for a while, turns importantly on what it sounds like. But there is some hope to be had in the fact that New Labour is no settled thing. The party may grow averse to going so much by the sounds of things: it can make you ratty at the despatch box, and it doesn't make for a good life, even with the chauffeurs. Clear truth can turn out to be worth something. This is a real book, not written by a spin doctor. Read it and worry. Read it and hope. \u0095 Ted Honderich is a professor of philosophy at University College, London.",

      "body": "<p>When it comes to the subject of husbands and wives working together as director and actress, one couldn't ask for a better place to start than the movie of that title Husbands And Wives starring Woody Allen and his longtime paramour Mia Farrow. At the time of its American release in 1992, given the circumstances then prevailing in the protagonists' lives, no film could have been more layered with dark ironies and unintended revelations and parallels. </p> <p>Onscreen, Woody and Mia played a happily married couple, while Juliette Lewis played a 19-year-old student Woody gets the hots for. Meanwhile, in the media they were trading accusations of child-molestation, serial infidelity, commitment phobia and psychotic levels of New York neurosis. Woody was directing his own wife in a thinly fictionalised version of events that, unbeknownst to Mia, were then transpiring in his own life. By the time the film was in cinemas, Woody's relationship with Farrow's adopted teenage daughter Soon-Yi was public knowledge, and Mia and Woody were sundering their union in a war of writs, each marshalling entire PR companies to defame and belittle the other. It was the most spectacular celeb break-up of them all. It was magnificent, and it was instantly memorialised in a film-a-clef that went on to earn several Oscar nominations.</p> <p>What is it with male movie directors and female movie stars? What special magic exists on movie sets that makes trousers drop and skirts rise? With Mia there were special circumstances that the amateur Freudian could dwell on for weeks. As a child she once caught her father, John Farrow, a movie director and a devout Roman Catholic, in frankly hypocritical flagrante delicto with a woman not his wife at one of his Hollywood parties, which must have been deeply disturbing and confusing for Mia (whose actorly persona rests on a foundation of fragility and vulnerability). After a series of marriages to much older men - Andr\u00e9 Previn, Frank Sinatra - she ended up with Woody, an older writer-director, a creator, an educator of his muse-like lover-stars. In short, a puppetmaster looking for an actress willing to play Daddy's Little Girl. Given Allen's propensity for casting lithe teenagers in his movies - everyone from Mariel Hemingway to Natalie Portman - and his habit of trading in his women for younger models (Louise Lasser to Diane Keaton to Mia to Soon-Yi), perhaps she should have seen it all coming. </p> <p>But there was another side to the story, as there often is with directors and actresses in turbulent relationships: they made some great movies together, including Husbands And Wives and Crimes And Misdemeanors, two of Allen's finest moments. And if one looks at many other director-actress relationships, one can't help noticing the number of good films many of them have produced, whether by accident or design. </p> <p>Peter Bogdanovich and Cybill Shepherd, for instance, made The Last Picture Show together. There was the long marriage and extremely productive partnership between John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands. Claude Chabrol and his mesmerising St\u00e9phane Audran made literally dozens of superb thrillers together. Then there are Jean-Luc Godard and Anna Karina, Carlos Saura and Geraldine Chaplin, Olivier Assayas and Maggie \"the Cat\" Cheung, and Zhang Yimou and Gong Li. Some of the world's great postwar cinema came out of the partnerships between Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann, Federico Fellini and Giulietta Masina, and Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman, the last of whom had a love story as inspiring and romantic as any of the beautiful movies they made together. In fact, their daughter Isabella has been wife and artistic inspiration to both Martin Scorsese and David Lynch, which may say something about the hot-cold fission produced by Scandinavian and Italian genes.</p> <p>When you look at the phenomenon closely, it's hard to deny that the issue of power lies at its heart. The director has the tangible power in a movie-making situation, particularly on a location, because he's the boss. He's quite literally the one calling all the shots. He is also by profession (and often by temperament) a manipulator of other people and an arranger of scenarios, both of which are necessary and useful skills in a dramatic context, but which become potentially exploitative when applied to the domestic sphere. Especially if he uses his movie sets as de facto dating agencies </p> <p>The actress, by contrast, will more than likely be a lot younger than her director and, if she's a newcomer, a lot more vulnerable to the blandishments of a strong svengali figure who must suddenly give her his undivided attention, and who after all was probably the person who cast her in the first place (come on down Luc Besson and Milla Jovovich: married in Vegas shortly after wrapping The Fifth Element, divorced shortly after wrapping Joan Of Arc). And in the hothouse creative environment of a movie set or some far-flung three-month location shoot, when partners and spouses are far away and the working day can last up to 18 hours, the opportunities for falling into bed, if not in love, are legion. </p> <p>But the director has his weak points too. As a species, movie directors are a geeky-looking, chinless, pointy-faced lot who've often (these days at least) wasted their entire adolescence in darkened rooms watching movies and eating junk food. Thus they often lack the requisite social skills to deal in a normal, healthy way with heart-breakingly beautiful young women, the likes of whom they've never encountered before. Had they not been movie directors, one doubts that Bogdanovich would ever have taken up with Shepherd, or that the nerdy William Friedkin would have married Jeanne Moreau. </p> <p>If the director is primarily a manipulative force, he may need to beware of meeting his match. Any woman who's grown up cursed as well as blessed by great beauty will learn to know exactly what any look on a man's face means (and usually it only means one thing), with the result that she likely knows a man's thoughts better than the poor bovine bastard does himself. If one compounds that basic skill with, firstly, the ability to act (which for man or woman is a literal training in the arts of flattery and deception) and secondly, a strategic sense of one's own career trajectory, then the notion of embarking upon what's often euphemised as a \"deeply creative collaboration\" can seem like a canny move. It's good for business. It can help one avoid loneliness on location. It's a means of being at the heart of things and inside the creative loop, and - catnip to thespians of all ages and genders - it's the surest way of being the centre of attention. </p> <p>I don't believe all or even most directors and actresses are necessarily this manipulative - I certainly can't picture Liv Ullmann taking much shit from anyone - but this is Hollywood, where all stereotypes take on flesh and blood. Nastassja Kinski was upfront about sleeping with most of her directors, including Roman Polanski on Tess. When it came to Cat People, remade by the pudgy-looking Paul Schrader in 1982, she was getting tired of it. \"I sleep with all my directors,\" she told Schrader after the movie wrapped, \"but with you Paul, it was hard.\"</p> <p>In the main, though, the directors are the ones making all the running. An actress may use a director to achieve or enlarge her own star status, but some directors serially dispose of their actress-lovers in the way business executives trade up on a new car every year. The quintessential svengali was John Derek, who ran a stable of undertalented blonde trilbies for over 30 years. He started with Ursula Andress, moved on to Linda Evans, and finally hit the jackpot with his tawdry and endless exploitation of Bo Derek's unstinting commitment to onscreen shirtlessness. </p> <p>The late Roger Vadim was Derek's French equivalent, degrading and idolising his wives and lovers in a series of throwaway movies. He's most closely associated with Brigitte Bardot, who was largely his creation, despite the title of their most notorious film Et Dieu Crea La Femme. Then he took up with Jane Fonda in her pre-political, bimbo years, and memorialised that period in her life with his lubricious sci-fi sex comedy Barbarella. He also had flings with Jeanne Moreau and a long relationship with Marie-Christine Barrault, but by the end of his life he was more famous for his womenfolk than for his films. His autobiography was called Bardot, Deneuve, Fonda: My Life With The Three Most Beautiful Women In The World, which really says it all. </p> <p>In the end, however cynical one may be about the motives and methods of director-actress collaborations, the resulting movies often prove that the injection of sexual chemistry, or even a deep and abiding love between them, can make for some fantastic movies. Just a short and wonderfully varied list should suffice to convince us: The Last Picture Show, A Star Is Born (Vincente Minnelli and Judy Garland), Blue Velvet (Lynch, Rossellini), Juliet Of The Spirits (Fellini, Masina), Person and Cries And Whispers (Bergman, Ullmann), Bitter Moon (Roman Polanski, Emmanuelle Seigneur), The Americanisation Of Emily (Blake Edwards, Julie Andrews), In A Lonely Place (Nicholas Ray, Gloria Graeme), The Lady From Shanghai (Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth), A Woman Under The Influence (Cassavetes, Rowlands) and most of Godard's mid-60s work with Anna Karina. And let's not forget Beneath The Valley Of The Ultravixens, starring the cartoonishly well-stacked Kitten Natividad, and directed by the laureate of softcore mammophilia, Russ Meyer. </p> <p>Exploitation? Obsession? True love and devotion? Whatever the magic chemistry was that caused them, movies like these are their own best defence.</p> <p>\u0095 Joan Of Arc is out on Friday</p>",

Ryan Giggs, finding his best form for months, could be the man to turn this game for the home side.<br><strong>3</strong> Andy Cole gets to watch the game from the bench as Sir Alex starts with Yorke and Solskjaer up front. United press for am early opening but the Liverpool defence seems to have started well. David Beckham is in his preferred position on the right, but has started quite centrally, looking to win early ball and take it wide himself. Carragher can expect a busy 90 minutes.<br><strong>6</strong> Smicer gains a good position in the United area on the right. With his back to goal and Hamann racing to join him, he overhits a simple pass that Hamann can only deflect for a goal kick. A good chance and Smicer should have done better and his teammates let him know about it.<br><strong>8</strong> Sustained United pressure as Keane cuts in from the right and drills a shot towards Westerveld's left-hand post. Carragher blocks the shot but the ball makes its way out to Giggs on the left. The Welshman beats two men before rolling it square to Beckham. His shot is poorly struck and the ricochet falls to Hyypia who is then set upon by Keane and Beckham until the awards the visitors a free kick.<br><strong>12</strong> A Beckham free kick on the right comes to nothing. Liverpool break through a long-ball to Meijer which is squared across the United area but no-one is there to finish the move. United clear and Beckham breaks down the right. His pass to Yorke is cushioned to Solskjaer, who in turn lays it off to Keane. The Irishman scuffs his shot harmlessly wide. Goal kick.<br><strong>16</strong> United again down the right as Beckham rolls the ball to Gary Neville, who plays an excellent first-time cross onto the head of Solskjaer 10 yards out from the far post. His header is long on power but short on control and sails over the Liverpool crossbar.<br><strong>18 Liverpool substitution:</strong> Song for Heggem.<br><strong>19</strong> Liverpool soak it all up and break through Camara. Smicer collects on the right but his ball into the United area is poorly directed and the move breaks down. Pretty soon they won't be giving the ball to him.<br><strong>21</strong> Song pushes up on the right and forces a corner off Irwin. Hyypia gets his head to the centre but the direction doesn't threaten the United net.<br><strong>23</strong> Yorke is taking wide positions on the left, allowing Giggs to play quick one-twos into the Liverpool box. Yorke benefits from the rapid interplay this time, crossing towards Keane at the far post. Hyypia gets in a vital back-header clear as far as Giggs on the centre-left. His first-time shot skids wide left.<br><strong>27 GOAL Manchester United 0 - 1 Liverpool</strong> Do you want fries with that net-buster? A Berger special from a central position 30 yards out. His left boot sends the ball rocketing towards the bottom right-hand corner of the net and Van Der Gouw is there but cannot prevent the ball screaming past him and sending the Liverpool supporters into rapture. A great goal.<br><strong>32</strong> United look a little shell-shocked after the fantastic Berger strike. Their build-up has slowed and Liverpool are winning more of the midfield tussles. Unsurprisingly, Liverpool are looking very confident in coming forward.<br><strong>34</strong> Berger again, this time from a flicked header from 10 yards in on the right of the United box. This time Van Der Gouw is equal to the task and parries well at his left-hand post.<br><strong>36</strong> A timely ball squared to Camara over the penalty spot is drilled goalwards by the Liverpool forward. Van Der Gouw may have had it covered but Stam makes that debate meaningless by clearing in front of his keeper. The Liverpool pressure continues and United are hanging on at the moment.<br><strong>39</strong> Hyypia is carried off on a stretcher and Houllier looks on concerned. Solskjaer's right foot clipped the Finn's left instep and the Liverpool defender came off worst. It's a deep cut that will require stitches - there are understandable doubts as to whether he will be able to reappear.<br><strong>42</strong> Liverpool temporarily down to ten men as Hyypia receives attention for the cut. United press forward and look to take advantage of their superior numbers. Yorke loses control on the left-edge of the Liverpool area and Camara can break through the centre. Stam is eventually forced to concede a corner from the left. The set-piece is a poor one but Liverpool regain possession through Smicer. The ball is sent long and Van Der Gouw collects.<br><strong>45</strong> A pinpoint ball from Beckham to Giggs on the left results in a cross that Westerveld collects with ease at the near post, with Yorke waiting behind him.<br><strong>46 GOAL Manchester United 1 - 1 Liverpool</strong> Liverpool are caught looking the other way for a second and are punished. Giggs picks up the ball on the left, and a simple kick-and-run gives him enough space for a low cross to Solskjaer at the near post. The combination of a lucky bounce and good control causes the ball to drop nicely onto his right foot, and the ball is slipped through the legs of Henchoz and past Westerveld into the far corner. It turns out to be the last kick of the half.<br></p> <p><strong>45 Liverpool substitution:</strong> Murphy for Hyypia. Hyypia, now sporting four stitches in his leg, makes it back on to the pitch, but only for a second as Murphy replaces him before the restart.<br><strong>47</strong> Beckham delivers from the right and Song denies Solskjaer at the far post. The corner is taken short and Beckham delivers again, this time from the left, but Liverpool clear well.<br><strong>48</strong> Another United corner, this time from the right. The centre sails over Roy Keane's head, and Stam cannot strike the ball cleanly. Liverpool clear but United regain possession immediately.

      "bodyText": "Manchester United: Van Der Gouw, G. Neville, Stam, Silvestre, Irwin, Beckham, Keane, Butt, Giggs, Yorke, Solskjaer. Substitutes: Bosnich, Berg, Sheringham, Cole, P. Neville. Liverpool: Westerveld, Heggem, Henchoz, Hyypia, Matteo, Smicer, Hamann, Carragher, Berger, Meijer, Camara. Substitutes: Song, Staunton, Owen, Murphy, Nielsen. 1 min A resurgent Liverpool come up against the Premiership leaders and look to overcome a ten-point deficit. Ryan Giggs, finding his best form for months, could be the man to turn this game for the home side. 3 Andy Cole gets to watch the game from the bench as Sir Alex starts with Yorke and Solskjaer up front. United press for am early opening but the Liverpool defence seems to have started well. David Beckham is in his preferred position on the right, but has started quite centrally, looking to win early ball and take it wide himself. Carragher can expect a busy 90 minutes. 6 Smicer gains a good position in the United area on the right. With his back to goal and Hamann racing to join him, he overhits a simple pass that Hamann can only deflect for a goal kick. A good chance and Smicer should have done better and his teammates let him know about it. 8 Sustained United pressure as Keane cuts in from the right and drills a shot towards Westerveld's left-hand post. Carragher blocks the shot but the ball makes its way out to Giggs on the left. The Welshman beats two men before rolling it square to Beckham. His shot is poorly struck and the ricochet falls to Hyypia who is then set upon by Keane and Beckham until the awards the visitors a free kick. 12 A Beckham free kick on the right comes to nothing. Liverpool break through a long-ball to Meijer which is squared across the United area but no-one is there to finish the move. United clear and Beckham breaks down the right. His pass to Yorke is cushioned to Solskjaer, who in turn lays it off to Keane. The Irishman scuffs his shot harmlessly wide. Goal kick. 16 United again down the right as Beckham rolls the ball to Gary Neville, who plays an excellent first-time cross onto the head of Solskjaer 10 yards out from the far post. His header is long on power but short on control and sails over the Liverpool crossbar. 18 Liverpool substitution: Song for Heggem. 19 Liverpool soak it all up and break through Camara. Smicer collects on the right but his ball into the United area is poorly directed and the move breaks down. Pretty soon they won't be giving the ball to him. 21 Song pushes up on the right and forces a corner off Irwin. Hyypia gets his head to the centre but the direction doesn't threaten the United net. 23 Yorke is taking wide positions on the left, allowing Giggs to play quick one-twos into the Liverpool box. Yorke benefits from the rapid interplay this time, crossing towards Keane at the far post. Hyypia gets in a vital back-header clear as far as Giggs on the centre-left. His first-time shot skids wide left. 27 GOAL Manchester United 0 - 1 Liverpool Do you want fries with that net-buster? A Berger special from a central position 30 yards out. His left boot sends the ball rocketing towards the bottom right-hand corner of the net and Van Der Gouw is there but cannot prevent the ball screaming past him and sending the Liverpool supporters into rapture. A great goal. 32 United look a little shell-shocked after the fantastic Berger strike. Their build-up has slowed and Liverpool are winning more of the midfield tussles. Unsurprisingly, Liverpool are looking very confident in coming forward. 34 Berger again, this time from a flicked header from 10 yards in on the right of the United box. This time Van Der Gouw is equal to the task and parries well at his left-hand post. 36 A timely ball squared to Camara over the penalty spot is drilled goalwards by the Liverpool forward. Van Der Gouw may have had it covered but Stam makes that debate meaningless by clearing in front of his keeper. The Liverpool pressure continues and United are hanging on at the moment. 39 Hyypia is carried off on a stretcher and Houllier looks on concerned. Solskjaer's right foot clipped the Finn's left instep and the Liverpool defender came off worst. It's a deep cut that will require stitches - there are understandable doubts as to whether he will be able to reappear. 42 Liverpool temporarily down to ten men as Hyypia receives attention for the cut. United press forward and look to take advantage of their superior numbers. Yorke loses control on the left-edge of the Liverpool area and Camara can break through the centre. Stam is eventually forced to concede a corner from the left. The set-piece is a poor one but Liverpool regain possession through Smicer. The ball is sent long and Van Der Gouw collects. 45 A pinpoint ball from Beckham to Giggs on the left results in a cross that Westerveld collects with ease at the near post, with Yorke waiting behind him. 46 GOAL Manchester United 1 - 1 Liverpool Liverpool are caught looking the other way for a second and are punished. Giggs picks up the ball on the left, and a simple kick-and-run gives him enough space for a low cross to Solskjaer at the near post. The combination of a lucky bounce and good control causes the ball to drop nicely onto his right foot, and the ball is slipped through the legs of Henchoz and past Westerveld into the far corner. It turns out to be the last kick of the half. 45 Liverpool substitution: Murphy for Hyypia. Hyypia, now sporting four stitches in his leg, makes it back on to the pitch, but only for a second as Murphy replaces him before the restart. 47 Beckham delivers from the right and Song denies Solskjaer at the far post. The corner is taken short and Beckham delivers again, this time from the left, but Liverpool clear well. 48 Another United corner, this time from the right. The centre sails over Roy Keane's head, and Stam cannot strike the ball cleanly. Liverpool clear but United regain possession immediately. Lots of opportunities for the home side at the start of the second half. 51 Liverpool are having some time on the ball - Meijer and Smicer pass it around the right flank until Smicer decides to place the ball out of play for a United goal kick. 54 Good passing between Yorke and Beckham on the right as the England midfielder is able to cross three times in succession. Nothing comes of the centres on this occasion, but if Liverpool continue to allow him to deliver telling balls into their area, all the points will stay at Old Trafford. 57 Roy Keane booked for an 'enthusiastic' challenge. 60 Song denies Keane at the far post after Beckham crosses from the right. Another corner results. Westerveld is able to claim the cross this time and releases Camara on the left. Stam prevents his progress but Murphy is able to break way and get to the by-line. His cut-back is intercepted by Butt. A corner to Liverpool, but nothing comes of it. 64 Giggs plays a perfectly weighted pass down the left flank for Solskjaer to run on to. Westerveld comes and is beaten, but gets enough of his glove onto the ball to slow it's roll goalwards and allow Carragher to clear off the line. 66 Titi Camara plays and excellent one-two with Berger which sends him clear through on Van Der Gouw, on the right of the United area.

It was somewhere near here, in March 1939, that the Imperial Airways flying boat Corsair came down. Not on the Nile, and not in Sudan or Uganda either (the direction-finding loop had reversed its polarity), but on a small waterway called the River Dungu, in a remote corner of the Belgian Congo. </p> <p>With the help of the provincial commissioner, the passengers were able to leave the enormous amphibian craft and eventually find their way to what, in those unreconstructed days, passed for civilisation. But the flying boat itself, while graceful in the air and buoyant on water, was stranded on land.

Christened Corsairville, in honour of those \"historic riparian cities\" Leopoldville and Stanleyville, it provides the imaginative focus for Graham Coster's voyage around the entrancing subject of the flying boat. Editor of Wild Blue Yonder, an anthology of aviation literature, Coster knows his planes; as he leads you through the lost era of Sunderlands, Solents, Catalinas and the gargantuan 10-engined 220-foot-wide Princess, you can really smell the gasoline. </p> <p>The author's travels take him all over the world, from Foynes in North Kerry - where flying boats used to ply their trade to the US - to America itself, where Howard Hughes built, totally out of wood, his ridiculous Spruce Goose (ostensibly to counter U-boat predation of Atlantic shipping, but really to foster his own self-image). But the heart of the tale is Africa. With its great lakes and long coastline, the continent was, it seemed, ideally suited to the flying boat. </p> <p>There were certainly many advantages: in particular, no need to build runways in remote places, with all the expensive earth-moving and civil engineering that involved. But there were also many problems: weight being of the essence, the thin aluminium hull had to be both large (to achieve the requisite flotation) and thin - no more, in some models, than 18mm thick. This made it liable to punctures from rocks - as happened with Corsair - floating debris or even hippos and crocodiles. Meanwhile, the aluminium was in constant danger of salt erosion. </p> <p>If this is a technical story, it is also a political and social one. These were \"planes for the few\". It says something about British readiness for the war, and for modernity in general, that we were building flying boats for colonial officials when Hitler was putting in orders for Panzers and the Volkswagen. </p> <p>Taking the flying boat was always something of an occasion. If news reached London that the weather was inclement, Imperial Airways would lay on a tea dance in the art-deco ballroom of Airways House on London's Buckingham Palace Road. And then, once they got the all clear, passengers \"would walk straight out on to a dedicated adjoining platform at Victoria Station\", from where the train would bring them to within yards of the berth at Southampton. </p> <p>On reaching Africa things would be very different. It was at Malakal, on the White Nile, that travel writer Alan Moorehead saw the women of the Dinka tribe react (or not react) to the flying boat. \"Six foot tall and as hipless as young boys\", they simply turned their heads away from the sight they were supposed to find so miraculous. The neighbouring Shelluk tribe, another correspondent records, were equally dismissive of flying:\"One of the mad things that white men do.\" </p> <p>For the white men themselves, however, the flying boat was inextricably linked with romance. Although it was intimately connected with the Empire, and for a short while made some money (from delivering \"air mails\"), in essence it was \"magnificent folly\". Similar terms crop up throughout the book as Coster strives to show how passengers were indeed \"transported\" by these amphibious beasts. But it couldn't last, and on November 3 1950 the last BOAC flying boat to Africa taxied out into Southampton Water. </p> <p>There are still a few places where smaller flying boats continue to be used (Alaska, for fishing trips; Florida, where Coster sees \"pinkish sea-turtles splayed on the surface\"), but really this majestic form of travel is over. The great flying boats, Coster discovers with a pang of nostalgia, have been cut up with oxyacetylene torches. </p> <p>In truth, the flying boats were nostalgic even when they were at their peak in the 40s. Aviation is usually forward-looking, bound up with the future and with technological progress. Flying boats, on the other hand, connect us with our past, with \"a long naval history we don't want to lose\". As such, they were always, Coster argues, \"an extension of the imagination\". This is why his tale does not suffer when the Congolese civil war prevents him from getting to the actual site of Corsairville. </p> <p>It does still exist, under a different name. And so, no doubt, somewhere, do the bits and pieces left over from the repairs: the rivets and piston rings that local women would, the salvage men said, wear as ear studs and bracelets.

      "bodyText": "Ms Liu, wearing a bright red sash, hands out leaflets in the centre of Hefei for a new hand-held computer. \"You need it as much as your mobile,\" she explains excitedly. \"When you plunge into the sea of commerce, you will succeed in everything you do!\" A few yards away, an older unrelated Ms Liu has plunged into a different sea. Laid off three years ago from a paper factory, she is shining shoes in a scheme run by the local labour federation. A basic polish costs two renminbi (15p) - but four will buy a de luxe shine. Working every other day in a job-share, she can earn 400 renminbi a month. Hefei is the capital of Anhui, long known as a poor province whose beggars headed for Shanghai. The city is at last on the move, though a long way behind its richer counterparts, Nanjing to the south and Wuhan upstream. Anhui has a population of 61m - slightly more than the United Kingdom - in an area the size of England and Wales. The future of China's economic and social development - due to be discussed in Beijing at next week's national people's congress - must largely depend on the prospects for Anhui and similarly less advanced regions. The province is in a state of early transition seen in the coastal regions 10 years ago: new brick houses are replacing the old mud-and-thatch cottages in the villages; more than 2,500 miles of new road were built last year. Hefei still has pedicabs but also an abundance of cheap taxis. A new pedestrianised shopping street cuts through the old city: the evening newspaper is available on the web. A temple houses a busy market selling mainly shoes. The old city wall has been replaced by a lakeside park. Beyond the wall, joint-venture factories are multiplying and new blocks of flats spread as far as the new railway station. The Hefei university of technology - a centre of pro-democracy activity in the 1980s but now politically silent - still attracts most of its students from outside the province. Yet Anhui remains a predominantly rural province. Its workforce has the sixth highest percentage of peasants in the country. So far the safety valve has been the huge appetite of rich urban and coastal China for cheap labour. Groups of young male peasants, clad in cheap clothes for the city with a few bundles of belongings, wait by the roadside on the main highway. They ride the long journey to Shanghai and other coastal cities on dust-coated \"sleeper buses\" with two decks of bunks crammed together. Entire village economies are supported by the migrants' remittances home. As many as 40% of the young men go out to do manual labour - a modern equivalent of the beggars who used to go out to ask for food. Everyone now realises that this is not a long-term solution, but the success of efforts to escape the rural poverty trap varies between Anhui's 56 rural counties. The difference depends not only on economic resources but on local initiative. \"We need to be able to satisfy the peasants' demands on the spot,\" says Wu Xuming, the Communist party boss of the fast-developing Ningguo county. \"This is a mountainous area with poor roads where sick people still have to be carried to hospital in a litter. The most important task is to raise our economic strength locally.\" Ningguo has the advantage of being located on one of the province's few railway lines, and can offer cheaper power and wages than richer Jiangsu province to the south. Foreign investment in Ningguo includes a large company making spare parts for US and German car manu facturers. The workers' wage is 500-600 renminbi a month - cheap for the employer but more than twice the average rural income. Another car-parts factory, owned by a well-known Ningguo entrepreneur, pays more than 30,000 renminbi a year to senior staff. They live in detached villas with lawns in an upmarket estate. Some even have integral garages - though none yet own cars. Ningguo has a relatively small population of 350,000 and most of its leaders come from outside the county - said to be an advantage in overcoming \"local xenophobia\". It also claims the distinction of possessing the only three-star hotel at county level in the whole of China: its heated rooms are equipped with mini-bars. Zongyang in the northern corner of Anhui, bordering the bleak mudbanks of the Yangtze river, is much further behind. Zongyang's mayor, Tang Zhijian, also claims to be confident about the future. There are leaders in the Chinese people's political consultative conference who will speak up for Zongyang's population of nearly 1m, he insists. He says Zongyang is planning to build a new power station. But when asked to supply some written material on Zongyang, local officials say nothing is available. Even Zongyang's newspaper is for internal circulation only - not to be read by a foreign journalist. This more circumscribed outlook can hardly help narrow the gap. Whether Anhui's backward counties can follow the national trajectory of development must also depend on the fight against corruption, which appears as serious here as elsewhere in China. Last week the provincial government met in Hefei to hear an outspoken report from the governor, Xu Zhonglin. \"Cadres must not only discipline themselves,\" said Mr Xu. \"They must be strict with their spouses, children, relatives and entourage to stop their positions being exploited for illegal business.\" He denounced those who \"will not investigate corruption, turn a blind eye to it, obstruct efforts being made, and shelter those who are guilty. But it will take more than words to convince cynical public opinion in the streets of Hefei. Three days after Mr Xu spoke, laid-off workers from a Hefei factory demonstrated outside the provincial headquarters. A taxi-driver held up in the traffic jam cursed the government, not the demonstrators. \"The workers are crushed by the cadres. They have every right to complain,\" he said. The people of Anhui and other less-favoured parts of China remain to be convinced they will have a fair share in the nation's prosperity.",

      "bodyText": "A former commander of Croatian forces in Bosnia was sentenced yesterday to 45 years in jail - the longest prison term handed out by the UN war crimes tribunal and the first verdict against a senior military officer in the former Yugoslavia. General Tihomir Blaskic, 39, who led Croat troops in central Bosnia during the war, was found guilty on 20 counts, including crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva convention and violations of the laws or customs of war. As a snub to the tribunal, he was promoted to general in the Croatian army after his indictment at the war crimes tribunal in the Hague was announced in 1995. But in a highly significant judgment, the court said Blaskic was implementing policies formulated at the highest levels of the Croatian government, thereby formally ruling that the fighting between Croats and Muslims in Bosnia was an international conflict. \"The Republic of Croatia did not content itself with merely remaining a spectator on the sidelines or even seek simply to protect its borders,\" the tribunal said. \"It intervened in the conflict, pitting Muslims and Croats of central Bosnia against each other.\" Blaskic was responsible for a rampage by Bosnian Croat defence forces across the Lasva river valley which left hundreds of Muslims dead and forced thousands more to flee the area. He ordered the murder of more than 100 men, women, and children, and emptied the Bosnian village of Ahmici of every one of its Muslim inhabitants before torching their homes in April 1993. Though Blaskic was not charged with killing Muslims by his own hand, he was found guilty of failing to prevent war crimes and to punish the perpetrators. \"The crimes you committed, General Tihomir Blaskic, are extremely serious,\" the French presiding judge, Claude Jorda told him. \"The acts of war... the villages reduced to rubble, the houses and stables set on fire and destroyed, the people forced to abandon their homes, the lost and broken lives are unacceptable.\" The indictment accused him of systematic attacks on cities and villages, destruction of homes and mosques, forcible transfer of civilians, taking hostages and using them as human shields. The verdict ended a 25-month trial in which 158 witnesses produced more than 3,000 pages of evidence. It was only the eighth in the seven-year history of the Hague tribunal. Blaskic's wife, Ratka, collapsed and was carried sobbing from the court after hearing the sentence. Blaskic himself appeared calm. His defence counsel, Russell Hayman, said he was \"surprised and disappointed\" at the ruling and said Blaskic intended to appeal. \"This is not a just verdict,\" he said.

      "byline": "Sean O'Hagan",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> German TV interviewer:</strong> 'You own a hotel. Now, you've made a film about a hotel. Why hotels?' </p> <p><strong> Bono:</strong> 'Rock bands tend to know a lot about hotels. Hotels are where we live.' </p> <p> Almost 10 years ago, after an afternoon's drinking by the pool of the Sunset Marquis hotel, I found myself sharing a cab with the lead singer of U2, heading towards the cluster of skyscrapers that comprise downtown Los Angeles. The area, Bono warned me on the way, was a place of extremes even by LA standards: by day, populated by bankers and bond traders; by night, a magnet for the disaffected, the down-at-heel and the just plain deranged. </p> <p>Our destination was the Million Dollar Hotel, a building that had captured the singer's imagination in 1987 when the band had done a photo-shoot on its roof during the tour that followed the release of their 15-million-selling album, The Joshua Tree. Within moments of our arrival, it was easy to see why the Bono, then infatuated with the writings of Charles Bukowski and Tennessee Williams, had been so mesmerised by the place. The Million Dollar Hotel had once been a symbol of the great American dream, and was so named because it was the first such establishment to cost that talismanic amount to construct. This being America, the fact was then duly celebrated in illuminated, 20ft-tall letters on the roof.</p> <p>Now, though, it was a shadow of its former self, and all the more intriguing for that. The 30s art-deco lobby looked like a cross between a film set and a welfare queue. Its once-opulent rooms were now home to a microcosmic cross-section of the lower echelons of LA's fiercely divided society: blue-collar workers roomed next door to welfare mothers; misfits and drop-outs mingled with the inevitable flotsam and jetsam of Tinseltown, the wannabes and might-have-beens stranded in that cruel limbo-land where Hollywood was both a cab ride and a whole world away. </p> <p>We gained access to the roof and stood in the shadows cast by the giant, rusty sign, surveying the gleaming glass-and-steel towers and, way beyond them in the distance, the hazy, sun-burnished hills. Then, Bono led me across to the edge of the building, nodded at the rooftop opposite, which had seemed reasonably close at ground level but which from here was separated by a yawning gap dropping 25 storeys to the street, and asked if I thought I could \"make the leap\". His beefy minder twitched visibly, wondering, like myself, where this was leading. The leap in question was probably not that big, but the drop... well, let's just say that a cursory glance over the side was enough to dispel any margarita-fuelled bravado and send me scampering back to the relative safety of the garish hotel sign. Much to the relief of the minder, Bono eventually followed me. \"It's do-able,\" he said, as we left the roof, \"but you'd need a good long run-up to it.\" </p> <p>Nearly 10 years later, The Million Dollar Hotel, a film directed by the German director Wim Wenders, starring Australian actor Mel Gibson and scripted by American writer Nicholas Klein, from an original story by the Irish rock star, is opening the 50th Berlin film festival. Metaphorically, at least, Bono - after a good long run-up - has finally made that leap. \"It was initially going to be a play about a leap of faith,\" he elaborates, in a car on the way to the gala opening of the film festival, \"but then it mutated into something bigger and darker. I'd call it a dark fable about the redemptive power of love. And love, of course, is the ultimate leap of faith.\" </p> <p> <strong> Italian TV interviewer:</strong> 'Ciao, maestro! Why did you pick this Million Dollar Hotel? It is a sad place, no?' </p> <p><strong> Bono:</strong> 'Very sad. I was there once when a woman was thrown out of a window.' </p> <p><strong> Italian TV interviewer:</strong> 'Fantastic!' </p> <p> The film opens with a long, single-take helicopter shot of downtown LA, accompanied by the opening verses of For The First Time, a slow, reflective U2 ballad from the 1993 Zooropa album. As the camera pans down to, and then across, the Million Dollar sign, we see a young man standing alone on the roof. In slow motion, he runs across the rooftop and makes an altogether different leap into - depending on where you're coming from - nothingness or eternity. As he falls to his death, we hear, in voice-over, one of the great opening lines of recent times: \"After I jumped, it occurred to me, life is perfect . . .\" </p> <p>It is a moment of pure cinema that recalls Wenders' last great work, Wings Of Desire, and reminds you why the director, though not on form of late, remains so influential. Similar bravura moments punctuate a film that is, by turns, baffling and strangely seductive, but that also, like too many contemporary films, outstays its welcome by some considerable time. </p> <p>Though it features strong performances from Jeremy Davies as Tom Tom, the holy fool at the story's centre, and Milla Jovovich, the model, actress and current face of L'Or\u00e9al cosmetics, the dreamy and narcotic narrative - part doomed romance, part murder mystery, part art-scam - unfolds at a meandering pace. The story, though ultimately heartbreaking, is peopled by a cast of damaged characters whose weirdness reflects the singularity of the real Million Dollar Hotel. Gibson fans would be unwise to expect an action-fest, given that he wanders through the film in a metal neckbrace and wears a permanent grimace; the result, we learn, of a botched operation to remove a third arm that grew out of his back. (His best line: \"When I was a kid, I could play the violin and wipe my ass at the same time.\") </p> <p>Rumours Stateside were that Gibson was less than enchanted with the final product, and he did not attend the festival. When I express my own reservations to Bono, he is unexpectedly candid about what has been, after all, a long-term labour of love. \"I think the beginning and end are fantastic, and the last third is good,\" he says, \"but the first act has a few too many lines that aren't funny enough. But there you go. It was a small budget, a 36-day shoot, so you're always going to drop a few balls.\" </p> <p> <strong> Austrian TV interviewer:</strong> 'Do you believe in angels?' </p> <p><strong> Bono:</strong> 'Yes, I do. And so does Wim Wenders.' </p> <p> At the opening night of the Berlin Film Festival, the invited audience, initially buzzing from a high celebrity presence then lulled into near-sleep by four long introductory speeches in German, give the film a prolonged ovation. It is later awarded the Silver Bear jury prize. Then again, this is Wenders' city, the landscape that he mythologised in Wings Of Desire, and he is regarded here with a reverence that seems undented by his recent run of less engaging films.</p> <p>\"I think Wim marches to his own tune,\" says Bono afterwards, \"and it's a very unmodern position he takes. I mean, I've nodded off during Until The End Of The World - he showed me the full, five-hour version in his apartment - but he's like a jazzman to me. He takes the melody line and changes the chords underneath, he improvises and extracts the essence. It's all about what you're left with. That's not where we're at right now, though, and he knows that, but he doesn't care. Wim once said that America had colonised our consciousness, but now I think it's advertising and MTV that have colonised our movie consciousness. It's Boom! Boom! Boom! Very fast, very self-conscious, and he's the opposite of that. His films are all about what hangs around in your head and your heart afterwards; that lingering resonance. Even people who haven't liked the film have found that it nagged at them for days afterwards. I can't figure out how he does it, but it's fine with me.\" </p> <p>For me, the most successful scenes are the ones without dialogue, when Wenders' allegorical urban landscapes are enhanced by some extraordinarily sensual music. The soundtrack tends towards what might be called \"ambient jazz\", and serves the narrative in the way that old classic scores used to, creating and counterpointing a mood. It also features two new U2 songs, as well as Jovovich delivering a pretty good version of Lou Reed's Satellite Of Love. The most intriguing track, though, is The Ground Beneath Her Feet, lyrics written by Salman Rushdie, and included in his \"rock novel\" of the same name. </p> <p>Bono and Rushdie first met when the rock star invited the writer - who was at the time a virtual recluse because of the post-Satanic Verses fatwah imposed on him by Ayatollah Khomeini - on stage during the Zoo TV show at Wembley Stadium in the early 90s. Rushdie has described the song as a \"kind of a rock version of Orpheus' lament... a beautiful, sad, ballady love song, perfectly suited to Bono's voice\". He is obviously a big fan of U2: he recently named them - alongside the Beatles, Elvis, Dylan, the Velvet Underground and REM - in a roll-call of his favourite groups. What, though, did Bono make of Rushdie's rock 'n' roll novel? \"I was taken aback by how accurate parts of it were. Okay, he might have got the shoes wrong - though I'm not sure he did - but who cares? His subject is ideas and people, and he certainly got that right. I know he does that magic-realist thing, which can be a get-out, but, honestly, I was shocked by his grasp of the pop life.\" </p> <p> <strong> Another German TV interviewer:</strong> 'Do you consider yourself a pioneer, musical or otherwise?' </p> <p><strong> Bono: </strong> 'I would certainly consider myself to be one of the inventors of the mullet. I think it comes down to Patrick Swayze or me.' </p> <p>The interviewer looks puzzled. </p> <p><strong> Bono:</strong> 'Anyone know the German for mullet?' </p> <p> Apart from once sporting the same awful haircut as Patrick Swayze, Bono has, as The Million Dollar Hotel illustrates, done a spot of pioneering in one or two other spheres. In the past 10 years or so, having already made U2 the biggest rock group in the world, then deconstructed their stadium-rock sound with a brace of challenging albums and two state-of-the-art, round-the-globe multimedia tours - 1993's Zoo TV and 1997's Pop Mart, respectively - he has pursued an ambitious extra-curricular schedule. He's recorded with Pavarotti and Sinatra; opened a hip hotel, the Clarence, and a successful nightclub, the Kitchen, in his native Dublin; brought John Hume and David Trimble together on a Belfast stage in the lead-up to Northern Ireland's historic Yes vote. In the past year, he has overseen the making of the film, written and recorded the soundtrack, penned an introduction to The Book Of Psalms for the Canongate mini-Bible series, fathered a third child - a boy called Elijah Bob - and seized hold of Jubilee 2000, the campaign to draw attention to, and hopefully abolish, the burden of Third World debt. </p> <p> <strong> German radio interviewer:</strong> 'Recently, you've met Bill Clinton and the Pope. Who's next - God?' </p> <p><strong> Bono:</strong> 'Oh, I'm sure I'll get to meet him one day. But maybe not just yet.' </p> <p> Bono describes Jubilee 2000 as \"bigger than anything I will ever have anything to do with again as along as I live\". It has thus far taken up a year-and-a-half of his time, and his global lobbying of the great and the good has helped ensure that at least $100 billion is written off the Third World's crippling debt to the west. \"Not a bad year's work, eh?\" </p> <p>A recent issue of Newsweek, in a cover story called Bono's Crusade, neatly summarised how he acted as a catalyst on what was, in effect, a stalled cause. \"Since the mid-80s, advocates have tried to call attention to the rising burden of Third World debt, only to have their arguments disappear into the yawn of public apathy. Their cause lacked sex appeal, visibility. It lacked . . . celebrity. Improvising an ad hoc network of academics, celebrities, demi-celebs and debt-relief advocates, and using his own star power as a calling card, Bono finagled his way into the varnished corridors of real power.\" </p> <p>It's true: Bono has successfully argued the case for debt relief and ethical investment with Clinton and his closest advisers, with hard-line Republican economists, with European presidents and with the British prime minister. Alongside Live Aid veteran \"Saint\" Bob Geldof, he even managed to blag an audience with the Pope, whose rosary beads he now wears draped around his neck - \"I swapped them for my Zoo TV shades.\" </p> <p>But why did he get involved with Jubilee 2000 in the first place? \"I remember coming back from Ethiopia with Ali [his wife], after working in the camps for a month there in the 80s, and both of us promising never to forget. But you do forget. When I first read about the campaign, it struck me as achievable, as well as desirable. So if I can open doors simply because I'm a celebrity, then I'll use that for all it's worth.\" So far, the celebrity ticket has got him into the Oval Office at the White House, and into the office of the chairman of American Express, as well as the Vatican. He even turned up in Sandy Berger's (Clinton's chief political adviser) office on the very morning they were doing the deal on Kosovo - \"Maps all over the place, and him going, 'Fine, Bono, but how much will it cost us?' It's been surreal, all right, but it seems to be working.\" </p> <p>What's been the most surreal moment? \"The Pope was pretty out there. He had some amazing footwear underneath the white frock - kind of Gucci-style oxblood slippers. Serious dancing shoes!\" Some people, I suggest, might find the idea of a rock 'n' roller meeting with the Pope - particularly the present one, who is not known for his liberal tendencies - something of a sell-out? \"For sure. I know a lot of women, in particular, are fed up and upset with the Pope for his stand on issues like divorce and contraception, and I can understand that, particularly as an Irish man. But, in this instance, he was a natural ally. He was into this cause in a big way. It seemed the obvious thing to do to try and get in touch with him. I wanted him to come to Cologne last year for the G8 meeting, but he couldn't make it, so he sent for us instead. Me and Geldof in the Vatican - I mean, you have no idea how surreal that was.\" </p> <p>Thus far, 37 countries out of the 46 targeted by Jubilee 2000 have agreed to all or partial cancellation of the debts owed them by the Third World, with Britain and then the US leading the way. It is difficult to quantify just what this will mean for debtor nations in the long term. As Newsweek noted, \"much of the G8 forgave portions of debt that were realistically unpayable\", but, despite some economists' predictions that some countries might actually make higher payments in the proposed new deal, Bono insists that \"certain terms will be set in place that the African countries are insisting on - new business deals, new trade, new investment, but on an altogether fairer basis. People forget,\" he adds, \"that Germany was availed of debt relief after the war and that's what kick-started the strongest economy in Europe.\" </p> <p>This is a rock star who has done his homework. \"I have some very cool people backing me up, like Jeff Sachs, who's an economics professor at Harvard. He can crunch the numbers when they try and bamboozle me. But, yeah, you have to know what you're talking about or these guys simply eat you for breakfast. I mean, think about it: I'm a scruffy rock star marching into the White House. It's a bit cheeky.\" </p> <p>Perhaps what is most intriguing here is not Bono's long-term embrace of the ideal of rock star as both activist and philanthropist, but the sense that we are living in a historical moment when the intercession of caring, credible celebrities can have an impact - in terms of global realpolitik - that would have seemed impossible even a decade ago. As Bono points out, since the likes of Clinton and, latterly, Blair came into power, there exists what might well be a one-off window of opportunity for pop-culture idealists to make a real difference. \"These guys grew up with rock and roll, they speak a different language from the likes of Reagan, Bush and Thatcher, who saw the 60s as the decade that poisoned their nation's youth. I would not have got a foot in the door of the White House in the old days, and I may not again after Bill Clinton goes. So, basically, you have to seize the moment.\" </p> <p>How, exactly, do you seize the moment with someone such as John Rockefeller, the Amex chairman, and all the other global \u00fcber-capitalists whose corporate creed surely regards the cancellation of debt as anathema. \"Well, I was told over and over again that the bankers would stop this going through because it is against their religion. That it's just not in their genetic make-up. That, to me, just meant I had to shift the focus from the politicians on to them. My whole vibe was, 'Who's Elvis here?' I wanted to cut the crap and go straight to the top.\" </p> <p>At the top, he finally encountered \"the real Elvises\", the likes of Larry Summers, the 43- year-old secretary of the American treasury, and Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, builders of the healthiest US economy in recent times. </p> <p>At this altitude, Bono's previous celebrity contacts came in very handy. A meeting with Bobby Schriver, a Kennedy nephew who also happens to be a music producer, resulted in Schriver's brother-in-law, Arnold Schwarzenegger, calling up hard-line Republican, John Kasich, on the singer's behalf. \"The Kennedys can open doors that I could not even get within stone-throwing distance of,\" Bono laughs, still obviously relishing his head-to-head with the American right. \"The meeting I had with Kasich [House Budget Committee chairman] was probably as far-fetched as it got, because this dude could not be a liberal if he tried. I was told over and over that he was the guy whose ear I needed in the Republican camp. I finally got through to him, and he goes [breaks into loud American drawl], 'Hey, Bono, what can I do for you?' I told him, and then waited for the phone to click, but he just said, 'Right. Okay. I gotta think about this, but, hey, just one question - do you think OK Computer is better than The Bends?' The guy was a total Radiohead nut.\" </p> <p> <strong> French TV interviewer:</strong> 'Is it difficult to make music when you have so many other things to do?' </p> <p><strong> Bono:</strong> 'Nah. Making movies is hard. Saving the world is less hard. Making music is easy. The new U2 album is the easiest thing I'll do this year.' </p> <p> The morning after the film's premiere, on the plane from Berlin to London, I ask if maybe all this extra-curricular activity signalled an unconscious frustration with the limitations of pop music. \"That's an interesting thought, and one that has crossed my mind a few times,\" he replies, \"but, essentially, it comes down not to frustration but to boredom, and my own curiosity about the world. I'm definitely driven by that and, in one way, pop music doesn't satisfy that drive. The thing is, I find it easier to hang out with writers and film-makers than I do with musicians. And, that's my fault, not theirs. And I actually enjoy being out of my depth - I thrive on it.\" </p> <p>It sounds as if you might be bored with pop per se ? \"No way - in the past year, I would keep waking up with all these tunes in my head and getting really frustrated because the band weren't around me to rehearse them. It gave me a real sense of what we do, and what we do well, and how much I missed doing it. Plus, we're leaner and tighter than we've ever been. If anything, I'm more fired up by U2 than I've ever been.\" </p> <p>For the present, at least, Bono is back at his day job, in the company of the Edge, Larry, Adam and long-time studio collaborators, Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno. A new, as yet untitled, album is currently being recorded in the group's Dublin studio and is scheduled for release in August. It will be followed by yet another planet-straddling tour that, reading between the lines, might well feature a return to rock basics after the full-on - and no doubt cripplingly expensive - extravaganzas that were the Zoo TV and Pop Mart jaunts. Bono describes the feel of the album-in-progress as \"stripped down but joyous. It's the sound of four guys playing in a room, rediscovering what they're good at.\" </p> <p>Though 1991's Achtung Baby and 1993's Zooropa albums both saw U2 successfully embrace a newer, hard-edged sound, 1998's Pop was a less realised attempt to merge rock and dance music. I asked him if he thought that the group had maybe lost their way on Pop; that they had, perhaps, sacrificed their essence in the race to stay ahead of the game. \"I don't look at it as any kind of failure. It sold seven million copies for a start. We had strong material and, though we worked everybody into the ground, I don't think we finished the songs or cracked the arrangements. We simply ran out of time. The tour was booked and we had to do it. We won't make that mistake again.\" </p> <p>If Pop was an album that could be said to have been born out of a particular moment - \"I became a fan of club music, of drug culture, of everything that was going on at the time. I just immersed myself in it all\" - then the new album sounds like a return to some kind of tradition. \"Pop was about assimilation,\" he says, warming to the unstated subject of U2's place in the pop scheme of things, \"but now I think that maybe assimilation is not the future. </p> <p>\"Ironically enough, it was Howie B [the DJ-cum-producer who worked on Pop] who turned us on to this. He's fascinated by the things that rock bands can do that he can't. He kept saying, 'You're a band, you don't need all these samples.' And it's true. We've become a three-piece rock band with a singer again. It's a good feeling.\" </p> <p>Suddenly, on the packed plane, he bursts into song, an a cappella fragment from a new track called In A Little While: \"In a little while/This hurt will be no more,\" he sings, his hands clapping time to the melody. \"In a little while/oh Lord . . .\" As besuited necks crane, he repeats the lines, louder now, a song, and a feeling, taking shape in this crowded cabin. \"That's the vibe,\" he laughs, swigging from a bottle of airline wine, oblivious to the slight commotion he has caused in the hermetic world of club-class privilege. \"It's totally upful. There's another song called Tough, which I wrote for my dad - a kind of you-don't-have-to-be-tough-all-the-time song - and a big soul tune called Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of. Brian Eno has bet me \u00a3100 that it will be the biggest song we've ever written.\" The spirit of the old pre-Zoo TV U2 - the fabled \"big music\" of Gloria and Pride (In The Name Of Love) - might be reasserting itself once more. \"It's nothing at all like the old stuff,\" he says, \"but, I suppose, if you don't like the spirit of U2 - if you don't like the moods and colours of U2 - you probably won't like it.\" </p> <p>Once, when I asked him about the dark tones of Achtung Baby around the time of that album's release, he told me that it was \"a series of variations on the theme of love betrayed\". I wondered, then, if the new album had a similar unifying theme. The answer was long in coming - and somewhat surprising. \"It's all written from a certain point of view, and if there is a governing idea it comes from something the Irish poet Brendan Keneally once said - that the best way to write was to imagine you're dead. You lose all vanity, then. I'm approaching it like it's our last record, really.\" </p> <p>Is he suggesting that it might actually be the group's final album? \"No, not at all. I'm just approaching the writing of it like that, as an experiment. I suppose what I'm saying is that you should treat every album as if it's your last, as if your life depended on it. The new stuff has fire and it has spunk. It's ecstatic music . . . There,\" he laughs, \"that should put loads of people off.\" </p> <p>Ecstatic, though, is what U2 do well. As Bono points out, \"it's easy to do angst and anger, but happiness is a whole other struggle\". He has, he says, been fired up of late by the \"swagger and joy of Oasis on their day\", and by the originality of Radiohead - \"There are some extraordinary moments on those last two albums that, to my ears, are as good as anything ever made in pop music\" - and, reading between the lines, it is these groups, rather than any of his contemporaries, that U2 are eager to compete with. \"I don't want to be in a band unless it's the best band in the world,\" he had told a gaggle of European radio interviewers earlier in the day, not boastfully, but simply as an illustration of the drive that still burns inside, that still undercuts everything he puts his overcrowded mind to. </p> <p>\"These days, everyone wants John Lennon's sunglasses, accent and swagger,\" he says, as a parting shot, \"but no one is prepared to take their clothes off and stand naked like he did in his songs. Putting your head over the parapet means something completely different these days, but it's still a big part of what rock is all about for me. You have to use your celebrity, negotiate your position and be aware that celebrity can diminish a cause as much as illuminate it. It's risky, but rock'n'roll is all about taking risks. For it to mean anything at all, you have to take different kinds of risks, you have to keep making that leap.\" </p> <p>\u0095 \u00a9 Sean O'Hagan. The soundtrack to The Million Dollar Hotel is released on March 13. The film opens April 28. The new U2 album will be released in the late summer.</p>",

      "bodyText": "German TV interviewer: 'You own a hotel. Now, you've made a film about a hotel. Why hotels?' Bono: 'Rock bands tend to know a lot about hotels. Hotels are where we live.' Almost 10 years ago, after an afternoon's drinking by the pool of the Sunset Marquis hotel, I found myself sharing a cab with the lead singer of U2, heading towards the cluster of skyscrapers that comprise downtown Los Angeles. The area, Bono warned me on the way, was a place of extremes even by LA standards: by day, populated by bankers and bond traders; by night, a magnet for the disaffected, the down-at-heel and the just plain deranged. Our destination was the Million Dollar Hotel, a building that had captured the singer's imagination in 1987 when the band had done a photo-shoot on its roof during the tour that followed the release of their 15-million-selling album, The Joshua Tree. Within moments of our arrival, it was easy to see why the Bono, then infatuated with the writings of Charles Bukowski and Tennessee Williams, had been so mesmerised by the place. The Million Dollar Hotel had once been a symbol of the great American dream, and was so named because it was the first such establishment to cost that talismanic amount to construct. This being America, the fact was then duly celebrated in illuminated, 20ft-tall letters on the roof. Now, though, it was a shadow of its former self, and all the more intriguing for that. The 30s art-deco lobby looked like a cross between a film set and a welfare queue. Its once-opulent rooms were now home to a microcosmic cross-section of the lower echelons of LA's fiercely divided society: blue-collar workers roomed next door to welfare mothers; misfits and drop-outs mingled with the inevitable flotsam and jetsam of Tinseltown, the wannabes and might-have-beens stranded in that cruel limbo-land where Hollywood was both a cab ride and a whole world away. We gained access to the roof and stood in the shadows cast by the giant, rusty sign, surveying the gleaming glass-and-steel towers and, way beyond them in the distance, the hazy, sun-burnished hills. Then, Bono led me across to the edge of the building, nodded at the rooftop opposite, which had seemed reasonably close at ground level but which from here was separated by a yawning gap dropping 25 storeys to the street, and asked if I thought I could \"make the leap\". His beefy minder twitched visibly, wondering, like myself, where this was leading. The leap in question was probably not that big, but the drop... well, let's just say that a cursory glance over the side was enough to dispel any margarita-fuelled bravado and send me scampering back to the relative safety of the garish hotel sign. Much to the relief of the minder, Bono eventually followed me. \"It's do-able,\" he said, as we left the roof, \"but you'd need a good long run-up to it.\" Nearly 10 years later, The Million Dollar Hotel, a film directed by the German director Wim Wenders, starring Australian actor Mel Gibson and scripted by American writer Nicholas Klein, from an original story by the Irish rock star, is opening the 50th Berlin film festival. Metaphorically, at least, Bono - after a good long run-up - has finally made that leap. \"It was initially going to be a play about a leap of faith,\" he elaborates, in a car on the way to the gala opening of the film festival, \"but then it mutated into something bigger and darker. I'd call it a dark fable about the redemptive power of love. And love, of course, is the ultimate leap of faith.\" Italian TV interviewer: 'Ciao, maestro! Why did you pick this Million Dollar Hotel? It is a sad place, no?' Bono: 'Very sad. I was there once when a woman was thrown out of a window.' Italian TV interviewer: 'Fantastic!' The film opens with a long, single-take helicopter shot of downtown LA, accompanied by the opening verses of For The First Time, a slow, reflective U2 ballad from the 1993 Zooropa album. As the camera pans down to, and then across, the Million Dollar sign, we see a young man standing alone on the roof. In slow motion, he runs across the rooftop and makes an altogether different leap into - depending on where you're coming from - nothingness or eternity. As he falls to his death, we hear, in voice-over, one of the great opening lines of recent times: \"After I jumped, it occurred to me, life is perfect . . .\" It is a moment of pure cinema that recalls Wenders' last great work, Wings Of Desire, and reminds you why the director, though not on form of late, remains so influential. Similar bravura moments punctuate a film that is, by turns, baffling and strangely seductive, but that also, like too many contemporary films, outstays its welcome by some considerable time. Though it features strong performances from Jeremy Davies as Tom Tom, the holy fool at the story's centre, and Milla Jovovich, the model, actress and current face of L'Or\u00e9al cosmetics, the dreamy and narcotic narrative - part doomed romance, part murder mystery, part art-scam - unfolds at a meandering pace. The story, though ultimately heartbreaking, is peopled by a cast of damaged characters whose weirdness reflects the singularity of the real Million Dollar Hotel. Gibson fans would be unwise to expect an action-fest, given that he wanders through the film in a metal neckbrace and wears a permanent grimace; the result, we learn, of a botched operation to remove a third arm that grew out of his back. (His best line: \"When I was a kid, I could play the violin and wipe my ass at the same time.\") Rumours Stateside were that Gibson was less than enchanted with the final product, and he did not attend the festival. When I express my own reservations to Bono, he is unexpectedly candid about what has been, after all, a long-term labour of love. \"I think the beginning and end are fantastic, and the last third is good,\" he says, \"but the first act has a few too many lines that aren't funny enough. But there you go. It was a small budget, a 36-day shoot, so you're always going to drop a few balls.\" Austrian TV interviewer: 'Do you believe in angels?' Bono: 'Yes, I do. And so does Wim Wenders.' At the opening night of the Berlin Film Festival, the invited audience, initially buzzing from a high celebrity presence then lulled into near-sleep by four long introductory speeches in German, give the film a prolonged ovation. It is later awarded the Silver Bear jury prize. Then again, this is Wenders' city, the landscape that he mythologised in Wings Of Desire, and he is regarded here with a reverence that seems undented by his recent run of less engaging films. \"I think Wim marches to his own tune,\" says Bono afterwards, \"and it's a very unmodern position he takes. I mean, I've nodded off during Until The End Of The World - he showed me the full, five-hour version in his apartment - but he's like a jazzman to me. He takes the melody line and changes the chords underneath, he improvises and extracts the essence. It's all about what you're left with. That's not where we're at right now, though, and he knows that, but he doesn't care. Wim once said that America had colonised our consciousness, but now I think it's advertising and MTV that have colonised our movie consciousness. It's Boom! Boom! Boom! Very fast, very self-conscious, and he's the opposite of that. His films are all about what hangs around in your head and your heart afterwards; that lingering resonance. Even people who haven't liked the film have found that it nagged at them for days afterwards. I can't figure out how he does it, but it's fine with me.\" For me, the most successful scenes are the ones without dialogue, when Wenders' allegorical urban landscapes are enhanced by some extraordinarily sensual music. The soundtrack tends towards what might be called \"ambient jazz\", and serves the narrative in the way that old classic scores used to, creating and counterpointing a mood. It also features two new U2 songs, as well as Jovovich delivering a pretty good version of Lou Reed's Satellite Of Love. The most intriguing track, though, is The Ground Beneath Her Feet, lyrics written by Salman Rushdie, and included in his \"rock novel\" of the same name. Bono and Rushdie first met when the rock star invited the writer - who was at the time a virtual recluse because of the post-Satanic Verses fatwah imposed on him by Ayatollah Khomeini - on stage during the Zoo TV show at Wembley Stadium in the early 90s. Rushdie has described the song as a \"kind of a rock version of Orpheus' lament... a beautiful, sad, ballady love song, perfectly suited to Bono's voice\". He is obviously a big fan of U2: he recently named them - alongside the Beatles, Elvis, Dylan, the Velvet Underground and REM - in a roll-call of his favourite groups. What, though, did Bono make of Rushdie's rock 'n' roll novel? \"I was taken aback by how accurate parts of it were. Okay, he might have got the shoes wrong - though I'm not sure he did - but who cares? His subject is ideas and people, and he certainly got that right. I know he does that magic-realist thing, which can be a get-out, but, honestly, I was shocked by his grasp of the pop life.\" Another German TV interviewer: 'Do you consider yourself a pioneer, musical or otherwise?' Bono: 'I would certainly consider myself to be one of the inventors of the mullet. I think it comes down to Patrick Swayze or me.' The interviewer looks puzzled. Bono: 'Anyone know the German for mullet?' Apart from once sporting the same awful haircut as Patrick Swayze, Bono has, as The Million Dollar Hotel illustrates, done a spot of pioneering in one or two other spheres. In the past 10 years or so, having already made U2 the biggest rock group in the world, then deconstructed their stadium-rock sound with a brace of challenging albums and two state-of-the-art, round-the-globe multimedia tours - 1993's Zoo TV and 1997's Pop Mart, respectively - he has pursued an ambitious extra-curricular schedule. He's recorded with Pavarotti and Sinatra; opened a hip hotel, the Clarence, and a successful nightclub, the Kitchen, in his native Dublin; brought John Hume and David Trimble together on a Belfast stage in the lead-up to Northern Ireland's historic Yes vote. In the past year, he has overseen the making of the film, written and recorded the soundtrack, penned an introduction to The Book Of Psalms for the Canongate mini-Bible series, fathered a third child - a boy called Elijah Bob - and seized hold of Jubilee 2000, the campaign to draw attention to, and hopefully abolish, the burden of Third World debt. German radio interviewer: 'Recently, you've met Bill Clinton and the Pope. Who's next - God?' Bono: 'Oh, I'm sure I'll get to meet him one day. But maybe not just yet.' Bono describes Jubilee 2000 as \"bigger than anything I will ever have anything to do with again as along as I live\". It has thus far taken up a year-and-a-half of his time, and his global lobbying of the great and the good has helped ensure that at least $100 billion is written off the Third World's crippling debt to the west. \"Not a bad year's work, eh?\" A recent issue of Newsweek, in a cover story called Bono's Crusade, neatly summarised how he acted as a catalyst on what was, in effect, a stalled cause. \"Since the mid-80s, advocates have tried to call attention to the rising burden of Third World debt, only to have their arguments disappear into the yawn of public apathy. Their cause lacked sex appeal, visibility. It lacked . . . celebrity. Improvising an ad hoc network of academics, celebrities, demi-celebs and debt-relief advocates, and using his own star power as a calling card, Bono finagled his way into the varnished corridors of real power.\" It's true: Bono has successfully argued the case for debt relief and ethical investment with Clinton and his closest advisers, with hard-line Republican economists, with European presidents and with the British prime minister. Alongside Live Aid veteran \"Saint\" Bob Geldof, he even managed to blag an audience with the Pope, whose rosary beads he now wears draped around his neck - \"I swapped them for my Zoo TV shades.\" But why did he get involved with Jubilee 2000 in the first place? \"I remember coming back from Ethiopia with Ali [his wife], after working in the camps for a month there in the 80s, and both of us promising never to forget. But you do forget. When I first read about the campaign, it struck me as achievable, as well as desirable. So if I can open doors simply because I'm a celebrity, then I'll use that for all it's worth.\" So far, the celebrity ticket has got him into the Oval Office at the White House, and into the office of the chairman of American Express, as well as the Vatican. He even turned up in Sandy Berger's (Clinton's chief political adviser) office on the very morning they were doing the deal on Kosovo - \"Maps all over the place, and him going, 'Fine, Bono, but how much will it cost us?' It's been surreal, all right, but it seems to be working.\" What's been the most surreal moment? \"The Pope was pretty out there. He had some amazing footwear underneath the white frock - kind of Gucci-style oxblood slippers. Serious dancing shoes!\" Some people, I suggest, might find the idea of a rock 'n' roller meeting with the Pope - particularly the present one, who is not known for his liberal tendencies - something of a sell-out? \"For sure.

I wanted him to come to Cologne last year for the G8 meeting, but he couldn't make it, so he sent for us instead. Me and Geldof in the Vatican - I mean, you have no idea how surreal that was.\" Thus far, 37 countries out of the 46 targeted by Jubilee 2000 have agreed to all or partial cancellation of the debts owed them by the Third World, with Britain and then the US leading the way. It is difficult to quantify just what this will mean for debtor nations in the long term. As Newsweek noted, \"much of the G8 forgave portions of debt that were realistically unpayable\", but, despite some economists' predictions that some countries might actually make higher payments in the proposed new deal, Bono insists that \"certain terms will be set in place that the African countries are insisting on - new business deals, new trade, new investment, but on an altogether fairer basis.

At this altitude, Bono's previous celebrity contacts came in very handy. A meeting with Bobby Schriver, a Kennedy nephew who also happens to be a music producer, resulted in Schriver's brother-in-law, Arnold Schwarzenegger, calling up hard-line Republican, John Kasich, on the singer's behalf. \"The Kennedys can open doors that I could not even get within stone-throwing distance of,\" Bono laughs, still obviously relishing his head-to-head with the American right. \"The meeting I had with Kasich [House Budget Committee chairman] was probably as far-fetched as it got, because this dude could not be a liberal if he tried.

The guy was a total Radiohead nut.\" French TV interviewer: 'Is it difficult to make music when you have so many other things to do?' Bono: 'Nah. Making movies is hard. Saving the world is less hard. Making music is easy. The new U2 album is the easiest thing I'll do this year.' The morning after the film's premiere, on the plane from Berlin to London, I ask if maybe all this extra-curricular activity signalled an unconscious frustration with the limitations of pop music. \"That's an interesting thought, and one that has crossed my mind a few times,\" he replies, \"but, essentially, it comes down not to frustration but to boredom, and my own curiosity about the world.

It gave me a real sense of what we do, and what we do well, and how much I missed doing it. Plus, we're leaner and tighter than we've ever been. If anything, I'm more fired up by U2 than I've ever been.\" For the present, at least, Bono is back at his day job, in the company of the Edge, Larry, Adam and long-time studio collaborators, Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno. A new, as yet untitled, album is currently being recorded in the group's Dublin studio and is scheduled for release in August. It will be followed by yet another planet-straddling tour that, reading between the lines, might well feature a return to rock basics after the full-on - and no doubt cripplingly expensive - extravaganzas that were the Zoo TV and Pop Mart jaunts. Bono describes the feel of the album-in-progress as \"stripped down but joyous. It's the sound of four guys playing in a room, rediscovering what they're good at.\" Though 1991's Achtung Baby and 1993's Zooropa albums both saw U2 successfully embrace a newer, hard-edged sound, 1998's Pop was a less realised attempt to merge rock and dance music. I asked him if he thought that the group had maybe lost their way on Pop; that they had, perhaps, sacrificed their essence in the race to stay ahead of the game. \"I don't look at it as any kind of failure. It sold seven million copies for a start. We had strong material and, though we worked everybody into the ground, I don't think we finished the songs or cracked the arrangements. We simply ran out of time. The tour was booked and we had to do it. We won't make that mistake again.\" If Pop was an album that could be said to have been born out of a particular moment - \"I became a fan of club music, of drug culture, of everything that was going on at the time. I just immersed myself in it all\" - then the new album sounds like a return to some kind of tradition. \"Pop was about assimilation,\" he says, warming to the unstated subject of U2's place in the pop scheme of things, \"but now I think that maybe assimilation is not the future. \"Ironically enough, it was Howie B [the DJ-cum-producer who worked on Pop] who turned us on to this. He's fascinated by the things that rock bands can do that he can't. He kept saying, 'You're a band, you don't need all these samples.' And it's true. We've become a three-piece rock band with a singer again. It's a good feeling.\" Suddenly, on the packed plane, he bursts into song, an a cappella fragment from a new track called In A Little While: \"In a little while/This hurt will be no more,\" he sings, his hands clapping time to the melody. \"In a little while/oh Lord . . .\" As besuited necks crane, he repeats the lines, louder now, a song, and a feeling, taking shape in this crowded cabin. \"That's the vibe,\" he laughs, swigging from a bottle of airline wine, oblivious to the slight commotion he has caused in the hermetic world of club-class privilege. \"It's totally upful. There's another song called Tough, which I wrote for my dad - a kind of you-don't-have-to-be-tough-all-the-time song - and a big soul tune called Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of. Brian Eno has bet me \u00a3100 that it will be the biggest song we've ever written.\" The spirit of the old pre-Zoo TV U2 - the fabled \"big music\" of Gloria and Pride (In The Name Of Love) - might be reasserting itself once more. \"It's nothing at all like the old stuff,\" he says, \"but, I suppose, if you don't like the spirit of U2 - if you don't like the moods and colours of U2 - you probably won't like it.\" Once, when I asked him about the dark tones of Achtung Baby around the time of that album's release, he told me that it was \"a series of variations on the theme of love betrayed\". I wondered, then, if the new album had a similar unifying theme. The answer was long in coming - and somewhat surprising. \"It's all written from a certain point of view, and if there is a governing idea it comes from something the Irish poet Brendan Keneally once said - that the best way to write was to imagine you're dead. You lose all vanity, then. I'm approaching it like it's our last record, really.\" Is he suggesting that it might actually be the group's final album? \"No, not at all. I'm just approaching the writing of it like that, as an experiment. I suppose what I'm saying is that you should treat every album as if it's your last, as if your life depended on it. The new stuff has fire and it has spunk. It's ecstatic music . . . There,\" he laughs, \"that should put loads of people off.\" Ecstatic, though, is what U2 do well. As Bono points out, \"it's easy to do angst and anger, but happiness is a whole other struggle\". He has, he says, been fired up of late by the \"swagger and joy of Oasis on their day\", and by the originality of Radiohead - \"There are some extraordinary moments on those last two albums that, to my ears, are as good as anything ever made in pop music\" - and, reading between the lines, it is these groups, rather than any of his contemporaries, that U2 are eager to compete with. \"I don't want to be in a band unless it's the best band in the world,\" he had told a gaggle of European radio interviewers earlier in the day, not boastfully, but simply as an illustration of the drive that still burns inside, that still undercuts everything he puts his overcrowded mind to. \"These days, everyone wants John Lennon's sunglasses, accent and swagger,\" he says, as a parting shot, \"but no one is prepared to take their clothes off and stand naked like he did in his songs. Putting your head over the parapet means something completely different these days, but it's still a big part of what rock is all about for me. You have to use your celebrity, negotiate your position and be aware that celebrity can diminish a cause as much as illuminate it. It's risky, but rock'n'roll is all about taking risks. For it to mean anything at all, you have to take different kinds of risks, you have to keep making that leap.\" \u0095 \u00a9 Sean O'Hagan. The soundtrack to The Million Dollar Hotel is released on March 13. The film opens April 28. The new U2 album will be released in the late summer.",

Libraries are, says Chris Smith, secretary of state for culture, media and sport, \"our street-corner universities\", and the government - after a bit of a wobbly, when it looked as if an unfortunate number of old city-centre libraries were about to be closed down - has directed \u00a3270m of Lottery money into creating what it calls the People's Network, whereby every one of Britain's 4,160 public libraries will be connected to the internet. The good old public library, it seems, is back in vogue. And nowhere more than in the old heart of Peckham, in south-east London. </p> <p>This month sees the opening of the Peckham Library and Information Centre, one of the most distinctive new buildings in Britain and one that aims to draw a broad public back to reading and researching in the age of video shops and burger joints. Actually, the Library Association claims that going to the library is the most popular activity outside the home, outranking going to the pub, eating in a restaurant and masticating in fast-food outlets. More than this, in 1997/98, we made 356 million visits to public libraries compared with 26 million to football matches. While we're on statistics, 58 per cent of us hold a library card, and we borrow, on average, just over eight books a year. Our public libraries hold 127 million books (just over two per person). Aside from those 4,160 public libraries, there are 663 mobile libraries, 26,000 librarians and the library service costs us 26 pence per person per week, the price of a first-class stamp. The most popuar library in Britain is Milton Keynes, with 1,210,980 books issued in 1997. And just so you know, the top ten authors are, in order, Catherine Cookson, Danielle Steele, Dick Francis, Josephine Cox, Ruth Rendell, Jack Higgins, Agatha Christie, Emma Blair, Terry Pratchett and Barbara Taylor Bradford. </p> <p>The Library Assocation is proud to issue this catalogue of neatly-indexed figures, because it is celebrating 150 years of the British public library. The Public Libraries Act, it says, was passed through parliament after tough opposition from the Tories. It was championed by William Ewart MP (1798-1869), a Scottish reformer who made his home in Liverpool, and Joseph Brotherton MP (1783-1857), a Salford cotton baron devoted to public work, free trade, abstinence (from the demon drink) and vegetarianism. Tories were probably most concerned that a little learning would encourage subversive behaviour among the lower orders. And they were probably right; for knowledge - as MPs of 150 years ago knew full well - was power. Just as the medieval Church was determined that the Bible should not be translated into the vernacular, so landed and financial interests wanted their labour supply to remain illiterate. Today, the Chinese government is attempting to censor the internet, perhaps the greatest leap forward in the spread of democracy since the invention of printing or, at least in this country, the 1832 Reform Act. The latter was opposed by the Tories. It was that year, 1832, that Thomas Carlyle thundered, \"Why is there not a majesty's library in every county town? There is a majesty's jail and gallows in every one.\" </p> <p>In fact, what persuaded the Tories in 1850 that public libraries were a good thing was their promoters' belief that they would act as \"cheap police force\" in much the same way as Association Football was meant to when established 50 years later: it kept the masses off the street. Instead of drinking, forming mobs and rioting, they would sit and read. It was true. A century-and-a-half on, public libraries have the power to calm. They are havens for the destitute and the troubled in spirit, places for the unemployed, bored schoolchildren and the elderly to while away days in the company of books; havens, too, for those who have resorted to public libraries as alternative seats of learning. A library is a place where the adults in charge positively encourage us to think, and, when we were children, ordered the books we so much wanted to read but could never afford. Here we gained some of our very first civic rights and steps towards citizenship: we got our library card and plunged into the worlds of Milly Molly Mandy, Fattypuffs and Thinnifers, Jennings and Darbyshire, Orlando The Cat, Ivanhoe, Wild Fang, or whatever took our fancy. We learned, too, in those spick-and-span public buildings, how to keep our voices down and how to behave as responsible public figures. We dreamed of the day when we could squeak-squeak-squeak across the highly polished floors and up the stairs to the adult section when, sadly, it was time to wave goodbye to Milly Molly Mandy and to plunge into the world of books without pictures. </p> <p>Architecturally, libraries have always been fascinating places, built in the early days in grandiloquent style that spoke of the importance of learning. Very many British libraries were built by philanthropists, notably Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919), the working-class Scottish boy who forged himself into legend as a US steel magnate. He built no fewer than 2,800 libraries across the English-speaking world; by the time of his death, more than half the library authorities in Great Britain boasted Carnegie libraries. \"There is not such a cradle of democracy upon the earth,\" he said, \"as the free public library, this republic of letters where neither rank, office nor wealth receives the slightest consideration.\" Eighty years after his death, Anne Fine, author of many children's books, says, \"I vividly remember every library I've used, and Andrew Carnegie is the only man with a beard I would ever have considered marrying. I was never prouder than the day I won the Library Association Carnegie Medal for the first time. I felt I had put something back into a system that had offered me, as it's still offering so many of the young readers who write to me, the chance to fly.\" </p> <p>The British public library went from strength to strength. Motorised, in Perthshire, in 1920. Lending gramophone records (Middlesex) from 1935, cassettes from 1972 (Cardiganshire) and issuing online catalogues (Somerset) 10 years later. Hendon was the nation's first \"multi-media library\", in 1998. And, in between, the rise of decent buildings in all shapes and styles. A converted tithe barn in Ruislip, an essay in Festival of Britain style in Holborn, a severe use of steel and pre-cast flint panels at Gorleston, Norfolk. And now, one of the best, the remarkable Peckham Library, commissioned by the London Borough of Southwark and designed by Alsop &amp; Stormer, architects of North Greenwich station (alight here for the Dome) on London Underground's Jubilee Line extension. </p> <p>The Peckham Library is a bit of a show-off building, as it was intended to be. Its purpose, in a smaller way, and at a 20th of the cost, is to do for this poor area of inner-London what, say, Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum has done for Bilbao: draw attention, attract visitors and investment, cheer people up and let them know that, far from being forgotten, they have one of the most exciting new public buildings in Europe. The finished building performs a remarkable balancing act: it's genuinely fun to use, yet it's a convincing work of art in its own right. Performs is the right word: this is an acrobatic building. A big inverted L sheathed in patinated turquoise copper on three sides with a Joseph's coat of coloured glass on the fourth, the lending library itself juts out from upper floors and is held in place by tall, thin steel columns set at apparently crazy angles. Huge letters on the flat roof spell out the word LIBRARY, just in case you find it hard to fathom what this strange building is. The roof is capped with a rooflight or lantern in the guise of what looks like the sort of beret Philippe Starck might wear to \"\u00e9pate la bourgeoisie\". It's orange and blobby and likely to appeal to the child in us all, even though this is, fundamentally, a thoughtful and mature building. </p> <p>If the exterior is wilful and designed to stand out from the crowd, the interiors are utterly unexpected. But, before diving in, it's worth stopping to look around to see that, far from being simply a gesture towards making Peckham a zootier place, it forms one side of what is very nearly a complete new town square. Devised by Fred Manson, the London Borough of Southwark's energetic head of planning, Peckham Square has been designed to give a new heart to an area better known for its tough local-authority estates than its lovingly restored town houses. What, Manson's thinking went, do we like about Italian, French and Spanish towns? Those animated piazzas, places and plazas at their core. What do most British suburbs lack? An animated plaza, place or piazza at their core. Well, Peckham has one now. </p> <p>The project began with the raising of the Peckham Arch in 1995, an architectural announcement of things to come. It was followed by Peckham Pulse, a \"healthy living centre\" with a pool, gym and cafe, for everyone, in 1998. And now the library. Significantly, the library takes up the prime and dominant position, a symbol of the local council's genuine desire to raise the sights of underprivileged Peckhamites. What a change this public gesture makes from the kind of building that we have come to expect to take pride of place in our towns and suburbs: aggressive supermarkets, frozen-food centres, burger joints, electronic-goods bazaars, all dedicated to New Brit as avid consumer. \"A library book,\" Thomas Jefferson, author the Declaration of the Rights of Man, reminds us across two-and-a-quarter centuries, \"is not an article of mere consumption but fairly of capital, and often in the case of professional men setting out in life, is their only capital.\" The challenge for the architects was to make the new library not just an article of capital, but an even more exciting place to be than an amusement arcade or McDonald's. </p> <p>The building is entered from beneath the jutting lending library. Here is a generous double-height lobby that leads to a One Stop Shop dealing with just about every conceivable local query or complaint, dead parrots excluded. Up above is the IT (information technology) and multi-media centre for adult learning, computer training and staff use. The point here is that the library and its promise of learning is tied in with the idea of not just getting a job, but developing and nurturing a career. Who knows whether a new Andrew Carnegie (or Bill Gates, for that matter) might emerge from Peckham, from rags through knowledge to riches and the sharing of those riches with up-and-coming generations. At least now it's a possibility. </p> <p>A glass lift or glazed staircase takes visitors up to the lending library. On the way there are superb views of central London, stretching from the Millennium Wheel to the Millennium Dome. But, if these threaten to steal the show, they are reduced in significance by the sight of the lending library space itself. This must be one of the most extraordinary rooms in the world, a kind of Pop Art sci-fi fantasy crossed with a serious seat of learning. The huge, daylit space is dominated by three curious \"pods\", one with its top missing, like a ready-to-eat boiled egg and two that pop up through the roof. All three are raised on stilts, or legs (it's easy to imagine the pods walking off on their own accord one evening when the last librarian has switched off the lights). All three are sheathed in what look like patchwork quilts of leather. Close up, these are even odder, quilts of aircraft plywood stapled to the walls. As a result, the pods have an curiously zoological character. They are also a delight. </p> <p>One egg-shaped pod houses a meeting room to be let to local groups and societies. Its partner, at the other end of the lending library, gained by ramp or spiral stair, is a childrens' rumpus room, a place for plays and readings and magic shows and, and, and . . . This is a nice conceit, soundproof space in a public library, where little children can let off steam as they have become used to doing whether in the fluorescent-lit aisles of supermarkets or in those bouncy, beany playpens found in branches of IKEA. Meanwhile, the open-topped pod in the middle is an Afro-Caribbean library, where books and music can be borrowed. This is lit by a dome that turns out to be the orange beret you can imagine Philippe Starck wearing that flops on the top of the patinated turquoise copper roof. </p> <p>If there's something wrong here, it's that the flat roof is inaccessible. True, it is laced with the gizmos needed for heating, cooling and so on (the building is, for the most part, naturally ventilated), but it also has space, around the beret, for what could be an Italian-style espresso bar. Not only would this be fun, but the views around and across London from here are both revealing and inspirational. It's unlikely to happen, yet there should be a place in every town and suburb for a tower or other high spot that local people can climb up to get some sort of understanding of the lie of the land of the place where they live. </p> <p>By night, the library will be lit by soft blue floodlights and the orange beret will be floodlit, too: this public building will be a beacon, a seat of learning, as a civic palace, an enjoyable plaything and monument to a renewed civic pride. \"I received the fundamentals of my education in school,\" says Isaac Asimov, the acclaimed science-fiction author, \"but that was not enough. My real education, the superstructure, the details, the true architecture, I got out of the public library.\" </p> <p>For some years, it had looked as if the public library was to be downgraded, pushed the way of all too many public services into the invasive shadow cast by a greatly re-energised private sector. Now, particularly with the decline of inner-city schools, the role of the free public library as educator has been recognised by the government. Although the title, the People's Network, is a little cheesy, this initiative championed by Chris Smith is aimed, in New Labour speak, at \"delivering the street-corner university concept\", to support the idea of lifelong learning, for everyone, to encourage people to feel that they are citizens rather than disaffiliated pawns in a game of political economy, and to \"re-skill the nation\". This is all to be achieved by connecting every public library to the internet, and in the belief that children are just as likely (more likely?) to turn to computers for information than they are to books. It may well be that children coming from bookless homes will learn to enjoy reading, but through computers first. The fact that they will be encouraged to come to libraries to plug into the People's Network means that they will also be surrounded by books and, of course, by librarians ready and willing to help them explore a world many feel excluded from, that of the printed word. </p> <p>They might also come to appreciate the value of public services and public architecture. These, over the past 20 years or so, have been demoted, marginalised and even sneered at. We have been deliberately offered a picture - painted by politicians of all major parties - of a public realm that it not worth inhabiting. Private enterprise can do it all for us. It can't, because it wishes, above all, to make money out of everything. The profit libraries generate is through an investment in the minds and imagination of those who have energy and spirit, but no money to support them. Perhaps, by the way, this is why a nation was so shocked by the case of the playwright and diarist Joe Orton and his murderous partner Kenneth Halliwell being brought in front of the beak for defacing library books in the early 60s. This was the heyday of the public library, a sacrosanct place where \"No Talking\" signs lined the walls as surely as the librarians themselves were (in the imagination and in TV comedies at least) as severe and as unforgiving as we believe Jack Straw to be. Orton and Halliwell pinched books from Leicester library and amended original texts to make them obscene. It was all very schoolboyish, but to defame a public library was unforgivable. </p> <p>Yet within 20 years, the public library was on the retreat. What happened? Call it Thatcherism, call it the spirit of private enterprise, but in the 80s the great British middle classes discovered money in bucket-loads. They no longer needed the public library. Where once they had spent their childhoods browsing through its well-worn stock, now they liked to be seen in bright new bookshops, chains of them with their crisp new books, each one unsullied by tea stains and crumbs of Lincoln and Nice biscuits settled tenaciously in the margins of their pages. No more grubby finger prints. No more potentially hazardous diseases (many people believed that illnesses might be caught from library books as surely as from the seats of the sort of lavatories Joe Orton traded in). Enter Waterstones, Borders and Books Etc: exit the middle classes from public libraries. </p> <p>Even then, many local authorities appeared to be lowering the status of their libraries without being particularly sure of why. They began to bury them in multi-purpose civic centres, to deny them their special role on the urban and suburban stage. Hidden away as appendages to dreary 70s' and 80s' civic complexes, they were denied not just what had once been prestige, but the slight air of mystery that has always surrounded them. Just think of the number of times any of us, let alone famous people in history, has been hit by a single phrase in a book picked randomly from a shelf in a library on a rainy Saturday afternoon (a time now given over almost exclusively to shopping). Here is the strange power of the book and of the library. </p> <p>The library has more appeal than knowledge alone. It is a theatre of a sort, a place where some times we went, and maybe still go, to watch life go by as much as to read. They are places to imbue strangers with imaginary lives, to flirt, to dream, and for the poor, homeless and lonely to feel snug in the company of others while maybe ignoring them, to read the papers and perhaps even find a job. </p> <p>The exclusively book-buying communities miss out on this other side of public library life. The noticeboards. The people. The silence. The real-life drama of quiet desperation. \"A small branch in Swansea was my salvation when I was a young mother of two infants, housebound and in desperate need of nourishment and distraction,\" says the novelist Penelope Lively. \"I used to wheel the pram round to the library twice a week to re-stock - babies in one end, books in the other. I read my way through much of the 20th-century fiction during those years.\" Or here's the novelist Margaret Forster: \"I can't imagine how I could have got through my childhood without access, free access, to Carlisle Public Library. I haunted the building (a very fine building it was), the sort of child who takes a book a day out, whom the librarians never believe really read anything . . . it wasn't just the books which attracted me to the library - it was the atmosphere, the absolute peace, quiet, the almost holy feeling I had when I was inside it. It was better than any church.\" </p> <p>This idea of the public library as a set room apart from home, with its family rows and blaring telly, beeping computers, vaccum cleaners, yapping dogs, thumping stairs, has been an important one to those brought up in big families and crowded houses in which there was nowhere to escape to read, except perhaps under the stairs, snuggled next to the dog, or high in a summer tree in the garden. For the mind to have room to explore and learn, we need a physical place to hide away in or escape to. </p> <p>The clever thing about the new Peckham Library is that it has translated the fantastical side of public libraries, their subtext or dreamscape, into fresh architectural forms designed, hopefully, to spark the curiosity and thus the imagination of a generation of people young and in middle-youth who have never really known the multi-tiered pleasures of these special buildings. Alsop &amp; Stormer's building might well inspire not just budding novelists and plutocrats, but film-makers, too, in search of an ideal modern landscape of ideas and of the imagination. In Wings Of Desire, Wim Wenders has an angel whispering encouragement and suggesting ideas to lost-looking readers in the magnificent main reading room of the Berlin Library, designed by Hans Scharoun. The feeling here is that the inspiration a library offers can raise us on angels' wings. \"When I was a child,\" says Jilly Cooper, \"they were the most magic places in the world. It was like walking into Aladdin's cave and suddenly I discovered I could travel to anywhere in the world and anywhere in my imagination with those wonderful shelves of books I could read for nothing.\" </p> <p>After Milton Keynes, the most popular public libraries in Britain are at Aylesbury, Croydon (central), Chelmsford, Colchester, Nottingham and Southend. Will Peckham join them? It deserves to, and if not, those who still believe in public services and equal opportunities for all should put down their books and eat its bright orange beret</p>",

While we're on statistics, 58 per cent of us hold a library card, and we borrow, on average, just over eight books a year. Our public libraries hold 127 million books (just over two per person). Aside from those 4,160 public libraries, there are 663 mobile libraries, 26,000 librarians and the library service costs us 26 pence per person per week, the price of a first-class stamp. The most popuar library in Britain is Milton Keynes, with 1,210,980 books issued in 1997. And just so you know, the top ten authors are, in order, Catherine Cookson, Danielle Steele, Dick Francis, Josephine Cox, Ruth Rendell, Jack Higgins, Agatha Christie, Emma Blair, Terry Pratchett and Barbara Taylor Bradford. The Library Assocation is proud to issue this catalogue of neatly-indexed figures, because it is celebrating 150 years of the British public library. The Public Libraries Act, it says, was passed through parliament after tough opposition from the Tories. It was championed by William Ewart MP (1798-1869), a Scottish reformer who made his home in Liverpool, and Joseph Brotherton MP (1783-1857), a Salford cotton baron devoted to public work, free trade, abstinence (from the demon drink) and vegetarianism. Tories were probably most concerned that a little learning would encourage subversive behaviour among the lower orders. And they were probably right; for knowledge - as MPs of 150 years ago knew full well - was power. Just as the medieval Church was determined that the Bible should not be translated into the vernacular, so landed and financial interests wanted their labour supply to remain illiterate. Today, the Chinese government is attempting to censor the internet, perhaps the greatest leap forward in the spread of democracy since the invention of printing or, at least in this country, the 1832 Reform Act. The latter was opposed by the Tories. It was that year, 1832, that Thomas Carlyle thundered, \"Why is there not a majesty's library in every county town? There is a majesty's jail and gallows in every one.\" In fact, what persuaded the Tories in 1850 that public libraries were a good thing was their promoters' belief that they would act as \"cheap police force\" in much the same way as Association Football was meant to when established 50 years later: it kept the masses off the street. Instead of drinking, forming mobs and rioting, they would sit and read. It was true. A century-and-a-half on, public libraries have the power to calm. They are havens for the destitute and the troubled in spirit, places for the unemployed, bored schoolchildren and the elderly to while away days in the company of books; havens, too, for those who have resorted to public libraries as alternative seats of learning. A library is a place where the adults in charge positively encourage us to think, and, when we were children, ordered the books we so much wanted to read but could never afford. Here we gained some of our very first civic rights and steps towards citizenship: we got our library card and plunged into the worlds of Milly Molly Mandy, Fattypuffs and Thinnifers, Jennings and Darbyshire, Orlando The Cat, Ivanhoe, Wild Fang, or whatever took our fancy. We learned, too, in those spick-and-span public buildings, how to keep our voices down and how to behave as responsible public figures. We dreamed of the day when we could squeak-squeak-squeak across the highly polished floors and up the stairs to the adult section when, sadly, it was time to wave goodbye to Milly Molly Mandy and to plunge into the world of books without pictures. Architecturally, libraries have always been fascinating places, built in the early days in grandiloquent style that spoke of the importance of learning. Very many British libraries were built by philanthropists, notably Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919), the working-class Scottish boy who forged himself into legend as a US steel magnate. He built no fewer than 2,800 libraries across the English-speaking world; by the time of his death, more than half the library authorities in Great Britain boasted Carnegie libraries. \"There is not such a cradle of democracy upon the earth,\" he said, \"as the free public library, this republic of letters where neither rank, office nor wealth receives the slightest consideration.\" Eighty years after his death, Anne Fine, author of many children's books, says, \"I vividly remember every library I've used, and Andrew Carnegie is the only man with a beard I would ever have considered marrying. I was never prouder than the day I won the Library Association Carnegie Medal for the first time. I felt I had put something back into a system that had offered me, as it's still offering so many of the young readers who write to me, the chance to fly.\" The British public library went from strength to strength. Motorised, in Perthshire, in 1920. Lending gramophone records (Middlesex) from 1935, cassettes from 1972 (Cardiganshire) and issuing online catalogues (Somerset) 10 years later. Hendon was the nation's first \"multi-media library\", in 1998. And, in between, the rise of decent buildings in all shapes and styles. A converted tithe barn in Ruislip, an essay in Festival of Britain style in Holborn, a severe use of steel and pre-cast flint panels at Gorleston, Norfolk. And now, one of the best, the remarkable Peckham Library, commissioned by the London Borough of Southwark and designed by Alsop &amp; Stormer, architects of North Greenwich station (alight here for the Dome) on London Underground's Jubilee Line extension. The Peckham Library is a bit of a show-off building, as it was intended to be. Its purpose, in a smaller way, and at a 20th of the cost, is to do for this poor area of inner-London what, say, Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum has done for Bilbao: draw attention, attract visitors and investment, cheer people up and let them know that, far from being forgotten, they have one of the most exciting new public buildings in Europe. The finished building performs a remarkable balancing act: it's genuinely fun to use, yet it's a convincing work of art in its own right. Performs is the right word: this is an acrobatic building. A big inverted L sheathed in patinated turquoise copper on three sides with a Joseph's coat of coloured glass on the fourth, the lending library itself juts out from upper floors and is held in place by tall, thin steel columns set at apparently crazy angles. Huge letters on the flat roof spell out the word LIBRARY, just in case you find it hard to fathom what this strange building is. The roof is capped with a rooflight or lantern in the guise of what looks like the sort of beret Philippe Starck might wear to \"\u00e9pate la bourgeoisie\". It's orange and blobby and likely to appeal to the child in us all, even though this is, fundamentally, a thoughtful and mature building. If the exterior is wilful and designed to stand out from the crowd, the interiors are utterly unexpected. But, before diving in, it's worth stopping to look around to see that, far from being simply a gesture towards making Peckham a zootier place, it forms one side of what is very nearly a complete new town square. Devised by Fred Manson, the London Borough of Southwark's energetic head of planning, Peckham Square has been designed to give a new heart to an area better known for its tough local-authority estates than its lovingly restored town houses. What, Manson's thinking went, do we like about Italian, French and Spanish towns? Those animated piazzas, places and plazas at their core. What do most British suburbs lack? An animated plaza, place or piazza at their core. Well, Peckham has one now. The project began with the raising of the Peckham Arch in 1995, an architectural announcement of things to come. It was followed by Peckham Pulse, a \"healthy living centre\" with a pool, gym and cafe, for everyone, in 1998. And now the library. Significantly, the library takes up the prime and dominant position, a symbol of the local council's genuine desire to raise the sights of underprivileged Peckhamites. What a change this public gesture makes from the kind of building that we have come to expect to take pride of place in our towns and suburbs: aggressive supermarkets, frozen-food centres, burger joints, electronic-goods bazaars, all dedicated to New Brit as avid consumer. \"A library book,\" Thomas Jefferson, author the Declaration of the Rights of Man, reminds us across two-and-a-quarter centuries, \"is not an article of mere consumption but fairly of capital, and often in the case of professional men setting out in life, is their only capital.\" The challenge for the architects was to make the new library not just an article of capital, but an even more exciting place to be than an amusement arcade or McDonald's. The building is entered from beneath the jutting lending library. Here is a generous double-height lobby that leads to a One Stop Shop dealing with just about every conceivable local query or complaint, dead parrots excluded. Up above is the IT (information technology) and multi-media centre for adult learning, computer training and staff use. The point here is that the library and its promise of learning is tied in with the idea of not just getting a job, but developing and nurturing a career. Who knows whether a new Andrew Carnegie (or Bill Gates, for that matter) might emerge from Peckham, from rags through knowledge to riches and the sharing of those riches with up-and-coming generations. At least now it's a possibility. A glass lift or glazed staircase takes visitors up to the lending library. On the way there are superb views of central London, stretching from the Millennium Wheel to the Millennium Dome. But, if these threaten to steal the show, they are reduced in significance by the sight of the lending library space itself. This must be one of the most extraordinary rooms in the world, a kind of Pop Art sci-fi fantasy crossed with a serious seat of learning. The huge, daylit space is dominated by three curious \"pods\", one with its top missing, like a ready-to-eat boiled egg and two that pop up through the roof. All three are raised on stilts, or legs (it's easy to imagine the pods walking off on their own accord one evening when the last librarian has switched off the lights). All three are sheathed in what look like patchwork quilts of leather. Close up, these are even odder, quilts of aircraft plywood stapled to the walls. As a result, the pods have an curiously zoological character. They are also a delight. One egg-shaped pod houses a meeting room to be let to local groups and societies. Its partner, at the other end of the lending library, gained by ramp or spiral stair, is a childrens' rumpus room, a place for plays and readings and magic shows and, and, and . . . This is a nice conceit, soundproof space in a public library, where little children can let off steam as they have become used to doing whether in the fluorescent-lit aisles of supermarkets or in those bouncy, beany playpens found in branches of IKEA. Meanwhile, the open-topped pod in the middle is an Afro-Caribbean library, where books and music can be borrowed. This is lit by a dome that turns out to be the orange beret you can imagine Philippe Starck wearing that flops on the top of the patinated turquoise copper roof. If there's something wrong here, it's that the flat roof is inaccessible. True, it is laced with the gizmos needed for heating, cooling and so on (the building is, for the most part, naturally ventilated), but it also has space, around the beret, for what could be an Italian-style espresso bar. Not only would this be fun, but the views around and across London from here are both revealing and inspirational. It's unlikely to happen, yet there should be a place in every town and suburb for a tower or other high spot that local people can climb up to get some sort of understanding of the lie of the land of the place where they live. By night, the library will be lit by soft blue floodlights and the orange beret will be floodlit, too: this public building will be a beacon, a seat of learning, as a civic palace, an enjoyable plaything and monument to a renewed civic pride. \"I received the fundamentals of my education in school,\" says Isaac Asimov, the acclaimed science-fiction author, \"but that was not enough. My real education, the superstructure, the details, the true architecture, I got out of the public library.\" For some years, it had looked as if the public library was to be downgraded, pushed the way of all too many public services into the invasive shadow cast by a greatly re-energised private sector. Now, particularly with the decline of inner-city schools, the role of the free public library as educator has been recognised by the government. Although the title, the People's Network, is a little cheesy, this initiative championed by Chris Smith is aimed, in New Labour speak, at \"delivering the street-corner university concept\", to support the idea of lifelong learning, for everyone, to encourage people to feel that they are citizens rather than disaffiliated pawns in a game of political economy, and to \"re-skill the nation\". This is all to be achieved by connecting every public library to the internet, and in the belief that children are just as likely (more likely?) to turn to computers for information than they are to books. It may well be that children coming from bookless homes will learn to enjoy reading, but through computers first. The fact that they will be encouraged to come to libraries to plug into the People's Network means that they will also be surrounded by books and, of course, by librarians ready and willing to help them explore a world many feel excluded from, that of the printed word. They might also come to appreciate the value of public services and public architecture. These, over the past 20 years or so, have been demoted, marginalised and even sneered at. We have been deliberately offered a picture - painted by politicians of all major parties - of a public realm that it not worth inhabiting. Private enterprise can do it all for us. It can't, because it wishes, above all, to make money out of everything. The profit libraries generate is through an investment in the minds and imagination of those who have energy and spirit, but no money to support them. Perhaps, by the way, this is why a nation was so shocked by the case of the playwright and diarist Joe Orton and his murderous partner Kenneth Halliwell being brought in front of the beak for defacing library books in the early 60s. This was the heyday of the public library, a sacrosanct place where \"No Talking\" signs lined the walls as surely as the librarians themselves were (in the imagination and in TV comedies at least) as severe and as unforgiving as we believe Jack Straw to be. Orton and Halliwell pinched books from Leicester library and amended original texts to make them obscene. It was all very schoolboyish, but to defame a public library was unforgivable. Yet within 20 years, the public library was on the retreat. What happened? Call it Thatcherism, call it the spirit of private enterprise, but in the 80s the great British middle classes discovered money in bucket-loads. They no longer needed the public library. Where once they had spent their childhoods browsing through its well-worn stock, now they liked to be seen in bright new bookshops, chains of them with their crisp new books, each one unsullied by tea stains and crumbs of Lincoln and Nice biscuits settled tenaciously in the margins of their pages. No more grubby finger prints. No more potentially hazardous diseases (many people believed that illnesses might be caught from library books as surely as from the seats of the sort of lavatories Joe Orton traded in). Enter Waterstones, Borders and Books Etc: exit the middle classes from public libraries. Even then, many local authorities appeared to be lowering the status of their libraries without being particularly sure of why. They began to bury them in multi-purpose civic centres, to deny them their special role on the urban and suburban stage. Hidden away as appendages to dreary 70s' and 80s' civic complexes, they were denied not just what had once been prestige, but the slight air of mystery that has always surrounded them. Just think of the number of times any of us, let alone famous people in history, has been hit by a single phrase in a book picked randomly from a shelf in a library on a rainy Saturday afternoon (a time now given over almost exclusively to shopping). Here is the strange power of the book and of the library. The library has more appeal than knowledge alone. It is a theatre of a sort, a place where some times we went, and maybe still go, to watch life go by as much as to read. They are places to imbue strangers with imaginary lives, to flirt, to dream, and for the poor, homeless and lonely to feel snug in the company of others while maybe ignoring them, to read the papers and perhaps even find a job. The exclusively book-buying communities miss out on this other side of public library life. The noticeboards. The people. The silence. The real-life drama of quiet desperation. \"A small branch in Swansea was my salvation when I was a young mother of two infants, housebound and in desperate need of nourishment and distraction,\" says the novelist Penelope Lively. \"I used to wheel the pram round to the library twice a week to re-stock - babies in one end, books in the other. I read my way through much of the 20th-century fiction during those years.\" Or here's the novelist Margaret Forster: \"I can't imagine how I could have got through my childhood without access, free access, to Carlisle Public Library. I haunted the building (a very fine building it was), the sort of child who takes a book a day out, whom the librarians never believe really read anything . . . it wasn't just the books which attracted me to the library - it was the atmosphere, the absolute peace, quiet, the almost holy feeling I had when I was inside it. It was better than any church.\" This idea of the public library as a set room apart from home, with its family rows and blaring telly, beeping computers, vaccum cleaners, yapping dogs, thumping stairs, has been an important one to those brought up in big families and crowded houses in which there was nowhere to escape to read, except perhaps under the stairs, snuggled next to the dog, or high in a summer tree in the garden. For the mind to have room to explore and learn, we need a physical place to hide away in or escape to. The clever thing about the new Peckham Library is that it has translated the fantastical side of public libraries, their subtext or dreamscape, into fresh architectural forms designed, hopefully, to spark the curiosity and thus the imagination of a generation of people young and in middle-youth who have never really known the multi-tiered pleasures of these special buildings. Alsop &amp; Stormer's building might well inspire not just budding novelists and plutocrats, but film-makers, too, in search of an ideal modern landscape of ideas and of the imagination. In Wings Of Desire, Wim Wenders has an angel whispering encouragement and suggesting ideas to lost-looking readers in the magnificent main reading room of the Berlin Library, designed by Hans Scharoun. The feeling here is that the inspiration a library offers can raise us on angels' wings. \"When I was a child,\" says Jilly Cooper, \"they were the most magic places in the world. It was like walking into Aladdin's cave and suddenly I discovered I could travel to anywhere in the world and anywhere in my imagination with those wonderful shelves of books I could read for nothing.\" After Milton Keynes, the most popular public libraries in Britain are at Aylesbury, Croydon (central), Chelmsford, Colchester, Nottingham and Southend. Will Peckham join them? It deserves to, and if not, those who still believe in public services and equal opportunities for all should put down their books and eat its bright orange beret",

      "trailText": "<p>Dermot Bolger tells Nicholas Wroe about helping Irish writing grow up</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Dermot Bolger wasn't the only teenager with literary pretensions growing up in 70s Dublin, but surely no others have had such a lasting influence on the modernisation of Irish literature. Instead of scribbling some embarrassing verse and carrying round a battered copy of Rimbaud like his bookish contemporaries, in 1977 the 18-year-old Bolger decided to adopt a more practical approach. He got a job in a welding-rod factory to finance his own publishing outlet. First with The Raven Arts Press and then with New Island Books Bolger went on to both champion a new generation of Irish writers and carve out a successfully diverse writing career of his own.</p> <p>His initial ambition was to make a living as a writer by the time he was 40. He achieved it by the time he was 24. Since then he has published six novels with an seventh due in June, eight plays and six collections of poetry. He was recently the driving force behind Finbar's Hotel in which seven Irish writers - including Roddy Doyle and Bolger himself - anonymously contributed chapters about one night' s events in a Dublin hotel. (\"Bizarrely it has now been translated into Serbian and Japanese,\" he says.)</p> <p>This was followed up with Ladies' Night at Finbar's in which seven Irish women writers - including Maeve Binchy - had a crack at the same project. It has been adapted for a BBC Radio play which will be broadcast in April. Most recently this one-man publishing industry has edited The New Picador Book of Contemporary Irish Fiction, a revised paperback edition of which is published this month. </p> <p>\"When doing the anthology it was interesting to see how Irish writing had changed in the 20 or so years since I started,\" he says. \"In those days it was virtually impossible to do anything. I remember when Neil Jordan set up the Irish writers' co-operative they sold, literally, one copy of Jordan's first book in London. I spoke to an English publisher at the time about an Irish poet and he said the poet was as good as anything he published on his lists, but if he wanted to read about urban blight he reads a poet from Hull, and when he wants to read about the countryside he reads a poet from Ireland. We had a job to do as a tributary of English literature where the south was green and there was trouble in the north. There was no awareness of a whole new vibrant nation emerging.\" </p> <p>The situation is utterly changed now, although Bolger expresses some concern as to how far the pendulum has swung. \"When I started editing this anthology I phoned up one English publisher to ask him if he had any Irish debuts coming up. He said he had seven. This was astonishing so I asked to see them, but he said I couldn't because none of them were written yet. They were writers who, on the basis of a short story or two, had been given two novel deals. It was when the race was on to find the next Roddy Doyle and it frightened me. It makes you wish for an EC embargo on promising Irish writers for a couple of years to let us catch up. They should freeze them all and hang them on hooks in a big warehouse outside of Brussels.\" </p> <p>To his credit Bolger doesn't keep up the \"it was all better in my day\" stuff for too long. \"It used to be that the archetypal Irish writer would start off with a very sensitive book about a child growing up in a small rural community who would come into conflict with the Catholic church and into contact with their sexuality,\" he explains. \"It would wind up on the boat to England and generally a year or so after that the writer would follow suit. Now when a writer becomes successful they actually come home to Ireland. And there has also been an influx of foreign writers which is also good.\" </p> <p>The new atmosphere is in part due to the generous tax status of writers in Ireland but also because of the work of people like Bolger who managed to move the agenda of Irish writing into the age of the Celtic Tiger. He is justifiably proud of publishing the first books by the likes of Patrick McCabe and Colm Toibin and latterly a series of agenda-setting books on social issues, including a study of childhood in Irish institutions that exposed the roles of church and state in the virtual slave labour and torture of children in the first half of the last century. \"The scandal of this abuse is now coming out in a string of court cases,\" he says. \"But when I published the first expos\u00e9 of this hidden world a decade ago, several Irish printers refused to print it.\" </p> <p>Bolger's own fiction also trawls the new and contradictory realities of modern urban Ireland, where beauty and sleaze exist side by side. His 1990 novel, The Journey Home, was called, \"the best book about Dublin since Joyce\" by The Irish Independent. \"I was abused for examining political corruption in that novel,\" he recalls. \"But much of it is now being exposed by a series of public tribunals here.\" In his last novel, Father's Music, he tracked the twin underworlds of Dublin organised crime and the traditional music scene. </p> <p>\"When I worked in the welding-rod factory my hero was Pier Paolo Pasolini,\" he explains. \"Pasolini managed to the great feat of offending both the Catholics and the communists at the same time. I still think that if you can keep doing that you're doing something right.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dermot Bolger wasn't the only teenager with literary pretensions growing up in 70s Dublin, but surely no others have had such a lasting influence on the modernisation of Irish literature. Instead of scribbling some embarrassing verse and carrying round a battered copy of Rimbaud like his bookish contemporaries, in 1977 the 18-year-old Bolger decided to adopt a more practical approach. He got a job in a welding-rod factory to finance his own publishing outlet. First with The Raven Arts Press and then with New Island Books Bolger went on to both champion a new generation of Irish writers and carve out a successfully diverse writing career of his own. His initial ambition was to make a living as a writer by the time he was 40. He achieved it by the time he was 24. Since then he has published six novels with an seventh due in June, eight plays and six collections of poetry. He was recently the driving force behind Finbar's Hotel in which seven Irish writers - including Roddy Doyle and Bolger himself - anonymously contributed chapters about one night' s events in a Dublin hotel. (\"Bizarrely it has now been translated into Serbian and Japanese,\" he says.) This was followed up with Ladies' Night at Finbar's in which seven Irish women writers - including Maeve Binchy - had a crack at the same project. It has been adapted for a BBC Radio play which will be broadcast in April. Most recently this one-man publishing industry has edited The New Picador Book of Contemporary Irish Fiction, a revised paperback edition of which is published this month. \"When doing the anthology it was interesting to see how Irish writing had changed in the 20 or so years since I started,\" he says. \"In those days it was virtually impossible to do anything. I remember when Neil Jordan set up the Irish writers' co-operative they sold, literally, one copy of Jordan's first book in London. I spoke to an English publisher at the time about an Irish poet and he said the poet was as good as anything he published on his lists, but if he wanted to read about urban blight he reads a poet from Hull, and when he wants to read about the countryside he reads a poet from Ireland. We had a job to do as a tributary of English literature where the south was green and there was trouble in the north. There was no awareness of a whole new vibrant nation emerging.\" The situation is utterly changed now, although Bolger expresses some concern as to how far the pendulum has swung. \"When I started editing this anthology I phoned up one English publisher to ask him if he had any Irish debuts coming up. He said he had seven. This was astonishing so I asked to see them, but he said I couldn't because none of them were written yet. They were writers who, on the basis of a short story or two, had been given two novel deals. It was when the race was on to find the next Roddy Doyle and it frightened me. It makes you wish for an EC embargo on promising Irish writers for a couple of years to let us catch up. They should freeze them all and hang them on hooks in a big warehouse outside of Brussels.\" To his credit Bolger doesn't keep up the \"it was all better in my day\" stuff for too long. \"It used to be that the archetypal Irish writer would start off with a very sensitive book about a child growing up in a small rural community who would come into conflict with the Catholic church and into contact with their sexuality,\" he explains. \"It would wind up on the boat to England and generally a year or so after that the writer would follow suit. Now when a writer becomes successful they actually come home to Ireland. And there has also been an influx of foreign writers which is also good.\" The new atmosphere is in part due to the generous tax status of writers in Ireland but also because of the work of people like Bolger who managed to move the agenda of Irish writing into the age of the Celtic Tiger. He is justifiably proud of publishing the first books by the likes of Patrick McCabe and Colm Toibin and latterly a series of agenda-setting books on social issues, including a study of childhood in Irish institutions that exposed the roles of church and state in the virtual slave labour and torture of children in the first half of the last century. \"The scandal of this abuse is now coming out in a string of court cases,\" he says. \"But when I published the first expos\u00e9 of this hidden world a decade ago, several Irish printers refused to print it.\" Bolger's own fiction also trawls the new and contradictory realities of modern urban Ireland, where beauty and sleaze exist side by side. His 1990 novel, The Journey Home, was called, \"the best book about Dublin since Joyce\" by The Irish Independent. \"I was abused for examining political corruption in that novel,\" he recalls. \"But much of it is now being exposed by a series of public tribunals here.\" In his last novel, Father's Music, he tracked the twin underworlds of Dublin organised crime and the traditional music scene. \"When I worked in the welding-rod factory my hero was Pier Paolo Pasolini,\" he explains. \"Pasolini managed to the great feat of offending both the Catholics and the communists at the same time. I still think that if you can keep doing that you're doing something right.\"",

      "body": "<b> For Love And A Beetle - A Tale of Two Journeys, by Ivan Hodge with Petronella McGovern </b> (New Holland, \u00a39.99) <p> It was 1961, the year the Berlin Wall went up. Wide-eyed Kiwis Ivan and Beth Hodge had come to the end of a 14-month honeymoon in England and couldn't afford the air fare home. But at \u00a3439, a Gulf Blue VW Deluxe Saloon Beetle was just within their means. So they piled their shopping on the roof rack, took a ferry to Europe and drove to Calcutta, finally making it to Auckland by cargo boat. </p> <p>Cut to contented family life, daughters, a career in insurance and a comfortable retirement, yes? Well, sort of. Except that the little car (cue in theme tune from The Love Bug) remained in the family, cared for by Ivan's parents. So when the idea of a second honeymoon came up 35 years later . . . You could probably write the rest yourself. Actually, Ivan got a Canberra-based scribe to help him with that bit - just in case you were wondering how Beth translates into Petronella. </p> <p><b> A Traveller's History of Scotland, by Andrew Fisher </b> (The Windrush Press, \u00a38.99)</p> <p> In 1995, Michael Forsyth took over at the Scottish Office and attempted to give the Tories a more acceptable face. And not just a face, either. For when the film Braveheart opened in Stirling, Forsyth turned up wearing a kilt. Before long, he was upbraiding Scottish youth for not knowing enough about the history of their own country. They hadn't, it seems, read the first edition of The Traveller's History of Scotland. </p> <p>Perhaps they were misled by the title, which does rather suggest that this is a primer for foreigners and therefore not to be touched with a 12-foot pikestaff (see Battle of Bannockburn). In fact it's essential reading for anyone who can't see beyond the kilts and bagpipes of invented tradition, and all the more useful in this updated edition, which continues the story as far as the inauguration of the first Scottish parliament since 1707. </p> <p><b> Big Snake, by Robert Twigger </b> (Phoenix, \u00a37.99) </p> <p> How do you seek out a snake in the Malay jungle? Use your nose, of course. The smell you're after, says Twigger, is \"a distillate or variant of the smell of the reptile house, muggy, frowsty, a hint of bad breath, meaty, sweaty, not pungent but there, heavily there\". </p> <p>And why look for a tubular reptile in the first place? The spur in Twigger's case was something he came across on the internet. The Roosevelt Prize for capturing a live snake longer than 30ft had not been claimed since 1912. </p> <p>There was something else, too. Twigger was about to get married, and the man who had won a barrel of awards for his account of a year spent learning aikido with the Tokyo riot police needed a quick adventure. All sounds terribly macho, like one of those TV programmes where men in shorts wrestle with wild animals and shout a lot? Don't worry. Twigger is a poet. He wears spectacles and lives in Oxford. With his wife. </p> <p><b> Kibbutz Volunteeer, by Victoria Pybus </b> (Vacation Work, \u00a310.99) </p> <p> It was once described as \"the purest form of communism\". But the 21st-century kibbutz runs motels for tourists and floats its shares on the Tel Aviv stock market. So what happened to the ideals of common ownership, co-operation, equality and democracy? </p> <p>Perhaps that's another book for another day. If you want to get out there and write it, or just escape for six months to what can still be a relatively-socialistic micro- culture (expect to work a six-day, 48-hour week), Kibbutz Volunteer is an invaluable jumping-off point. It actually doubles as a working traveller's guide to the whole of Israel, taking in the more capitalistic settlements known as moshavim , as well as archaeological digs, conservation, tourism and au pair work. A change is as good as a rest. </p> <p><b> Secrets of the Stone Age, by Richard Rudgley </b> (Century, \u00a318.99)</p> <p> History, says Rudgley, is just the tip of the iceberg. Delve down into the vastness of prehistory and you don't need intervention from Atlantis or outer space to explain the wonders of ancient Egypt. The pyramids were simply the product of a build-up of skills that began way back - \"way back\" being a lot further back than you or I were taught at school. For our Stone Age forebears weren't as primitive as we take them for, says Rudgley, and even ancestors of the Neanderthals went to sea on rafts. </p> <p>Fascinating stuff, and what's more, the evidence is there for the traveller to see - megalithic temples in Malta, ice-age lunar calendars in Hungary and flint axes from Norfolk that demonstrate how, even in Paleolithic times, humans were fascinated by fossils. You saw it on TV, now here's the hardback. </p> <p><b> On the Missionary Trail, by Tom Hiney </b> (Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a317.99)</p> <p> The square-rigged whaler that slipped down the Thames and out to sea on the evening of the day that Napoleon died, was bound for Tahiti. The ship would be away for three years. Yet two of its passengers, a stout Yorkshire philanthropist and an Isle of Wight vicar, were away considerably longer. For these two Georgian gentleman had undertaken a task so perilous that the story of their odyssey reads more like fiction than fact. Their job was to report on the state of various Christian missions that had been sent from London to the far corners of the globe some years previously and had not been heard of since. Faith drove them to the other side of the world, and the things they found when they got there almost beggar belief. </p> <p><b> Champagne, by Maggie McNie </b> (Faber, \u00a312.99)</p> <p> It wasn't always bubbly - little more, really, than a greyish wine with a little gas trapped in it, on account of the fermentation continuing after bottling. A novelty brew - and a cloudy one, too, since that ongoing fermentation left a nasty yeast deposit. Who would have thought, in 1690, say, that this stuff would catch on? The story of how a downmarket little wine was painstakingly developed into the crystal-clear substance we know as Champagne has more twists and turns than a wine waiter's friend. In fact, given more stylistic latitude than this excellent series of Faber wine books permits, McNie could probably have written another Longitude. With blind monks, ingenious widows and any number of exploding bottles, she certainly has all the ingredients. As it is, her relatively sober retelling of the tale leads nicely into an exploration of the Champagne region - its people, its climate and, most important, its great vintages. </p> <p><b> Fred Dibnah's Magnificent Monuments, by Fred Dibnah and David Hall</b> (BBC, \u00a311.99)</p> <p> Easy money for BBC Worldwide, I thought. A straightforward spin-off from the TV series in which the bespecta cled, cloth-capped former steeplejack from Bolton (\"Britain's favourite steeplejack\", says the blurb, as if we have so many to choose from) gives us the low-down on a few buildings that take his fancy. In reality, though, this \"guide to impressive buildings and monuments in the UK\" turns out to be not such a bad idea after all, since it drives a welcome strimmer through the historical associations that can often obscure a structure like a bad case of ivy. There are more than 400 sites here, with an introduction to each category. It's a good selection, too, ranging from megalithic circles to the Millennium Dome, from the Ribblehead Viaduct to the Channel Tunnel, and from a Roman stronghold in Northumberland to the extraordinary artillery fort that the Victorians planted on the seabed one mile out from Portsmouth Harbour. </p> <p><b> The Elusive Truffle, by Mirabel Osler </b> (Black Swan, \u00a36.99)</p> <p> In Umbria, I once tasted an omelette made with eggs that had been in brief contact with minuscule slivers of truffle. Incredible! The stuff actually lived up to its hype. If only the same could be said for the subject of this book (it's not about truffles, silly). Osler has fond memories of Traditional French Cuisine - cooks who won't plan their menus until they have been to market, and so on. But these days, it's mostly microwave and boil-in-the-bag. There are exceptions, of course, and in this beautifully-written and illustrated book, Osler sniffs 'em out.</p>",

As it is, her relatively sober retelling of the tale leads nicely into an exploration of the Champagne region - its people, its climate and, most important, its great vintages. Fred Dibnah's Magnificent Monuments, by Fred Dibnah and David Hall (BBC, \u00a311.99) Easy money for BBC Worldwide, I thought. A straightforward spin-off from the TV series in which the bespecta cled, cloth-capped former steeplejack from Bolton (\"Britain's favourite steeplejack\", says the blurb, as if we have so many to choose from) gives us the low-down on a few buildings that take his fancy. In reality, though, this \"guide to impressive buildings and monuments in the UK\" turns out to be not such a bad idea after all, since it drives a welcome strimmer through the historical associations that can often obscure a structure like a bad case of ivy. There are more than 400 sites here, with an introduction to each category. It's a good selection, too, ranging from megalithic circles to the Millennium Dome, from the Ribblehead Viaduct to the Channel Tunnel, and from a Roman stronghold in Northumberland to the extraordinary artillery fort that the Victorians planted on the seabed one mile out from Portsmouth Harbour. The Elusive Truffle, by Mirabel Osler (Black Swan, \u00a36.99) In Umbria, I once tasted an omelette made with eggs that had been in brief contact with minuscule slivers of truffle. Incredible! The stuff actually lived up to its hype. If only the same could be said for the subject of this book (it's not about truffles, silly). Osler has fond memories of Traditional French Cuisine - cooks who won't plan their menus until they have been to market, and so on. But these days, it's mostly microwave and boil-in-the-bag. There are exceptions, of course, and in this beautifully-written and illustrated book, Osler sniffs 'em out.",

The medium Estelle Roberts, an old associate of Conan Doyle, took the stage and embarked on a long, inspired monologue. At the climax of her performance, she cried \"He is here!

As she murmured confidentially to them, his widow reportedly smiled serenely. </p> <p>Arthur Conan Doyle claimed that he would most like to be remembered for his promotion of spiritualism. Sometimes perplexedly, Stashower tries to do justice to his subject's strange priorities. He has spent time \"dutifully slogging\", as he puts it, through Conan Doyle's copious writings on ectoplasm, \"spirit communications\" and the like.</p> <p>It is sometimes droll, sometimes mad stuff. What this book lacks is a way of seeing Conan Doyle's obsession as a symptom of his age. Stashower vividly retells Conan Doyle's early flirtations with spiritualism as a Southsea GP, having lost his Catholic faith; yet he only glimpses that Conan Doyle is not untypical. Indeed, the Society of Psychical Research, to which Conan Doyle was to belong, was a haven for leading late-Victorian intellectuals; with religious belief damaged beyond repair by science, reason had to find something beyond the merely material. </p> <p>Conan Doyle was himself puzzled as to why any intelligent reader would prefer a detective tale dashed off in a few days to one of his historical novels, composed by sequestering himself with works of scholarship. Stashower does not plead for the literary merits of, say, The White Company (the heroic deeds of English bowmen in the 14th century) or Micah Clarke (the autobiography of a 17th-century Puritan soldier). Sherlock Holmes dogged Conan Doyle, partly because the tales of detection that he wrote for The Strand Magazine were so lucrative that he could not abandon them.</p> <p>The great sleuth, sent toppling over the Reichenbach Falls, had to return (gloriously, in 1901, in The Hound of the Baskervilles). Yet Conan Doyle was also an indefatigable campaigner and polemicist, penning pamphlets about miscarriages of justice and endless letters to newspapers about improvements to the armed services. After travelling to South Africa, he produced his 500-page The Great Boer War. It was as an energetic apologist for British actions that he was awarded his knighthood in 1902; later he wrote a five-volume history of the first world war. </p> <p>His life beyond writing was full of unlikely achievements. He travelled on a whaler to the Arctic and on a cargo ship down the west coast of Africa. He was a founding member and goalkeeper of Portsmouth Football Club and played cricket for the MCC, once bowling out WG Grace and writing a poem about the encounter. (Stashower skates over the sporting achievements.) He was a pioneer of downhill skiing. He went ballooning and flying, and was one of the first people in Britain to be fined for speeding in a car. </p> <p>He was also a great befriender of other writers: Robert Louis Stevenson, Kipling, JM Barrie, Bram Stoker. He had a \"golden evening\" with Oscar Wilde at the end of which he and Wilde agreed to write something for the editor who was paying for their dinner. Wilde's contribution was The Picture of Dorian Gray; Conan Doyle promised more adventures for a detective called Holmes, who had appeared once, in A Study in Scarlet. </p> <p>Stashower gives a strong sense of Conan Doyle's commercial acumen as a writer, and of the ways in which this shaped his output. He was to spend much of his earnings on the cause of spiritualism, dedicating the last two decades of his life to polemicising for the cause. Latterly, his credibility was damaged by his support for two Yorkshire schoolgirls who famously produced photographs of themselves with fairies: Conan Doyle saw not cutouts, but proof of a population \"only separated from us by some difference of vibrations\". He wondered whether \"psychic spectacles\" might reveal the world of fairies to everyone. </p> <p>There are undeniably rich materials here, pacily narrated by Stashower, although done scant justice by his carelessness about providing sources. Yet it is difficult to see that this life adds anything new to, say, Martin Booth's equally full and readable account published in 1997. Conan Doyle's eccentric descendants have long since denied access to to the piles of manuscripts (especially letters) they still own. He seems to have known everyone who was anyone; if his papers ever become available, it really will be worth writing his biography again.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Never underestimate teenagers, or the books that are written for them. A notoriously hard group to keep interested in reading, it demands the greatest skill of a writer to get their attention and hold it without being patronising or crossing the boundaries of good taste that govern the adults who may still direct them. </p> <p>Melvin Burgess's <strong> Bloodtide </strong> (Andersen, \u00a314.99) is a savage story of war and its vast human cost. In a dysfunctional future which bears traces of our present social structure, King Val, ruler of the broken but still powerful London, makes a treaty with King Conor, master of the Outside, with its population of half-men and other genetically modified misfits. The price of the treaty? Signy, Val's daughter, given in marriage to his enemy: an old, old storyline that ends disastrously in betrayal and revenge.</p> <p>Burgess skilfully weaves his futuristic world, fashioned from the ills of contemporary society along with strands of the Volsunga Saga's shape-changing characters and deep undercurrents of fate and vengeance. Told in the contrasting voices of Signy and her twin brother Siggy, Bloodtide shies from nothing, making it both cruel and magnificent. </p> <p>Robert Swindells is also not frightened of shocking his readers. Winner of the Carnegie medal for Stone Cold, the story of a serial killer at large among the homeless, he tackles systematic and extreme bullying in <strong> Dosh </strong> (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a310.99). For too long, the Push gang has dominated the lives of the children in Cottoncroft. Paying a proportion of their cash as protection money to the racket run by Flitcroft, a drug dealer and small-time crook, has almost become an accepted way of life. But then Passmore and his friends set up Pull, a new collective prepared to stand up to the bullies of Push and defeat them at their own game.</p> <p>Swindells's schools, schoolchildren and their families are all convincing, and the excitement of the group response to intimidation is contagious. Sadly, the plot overreaches itself when Push's controllers are revealed as child pornographers and the children in Pull get trapped in an unsavoury scene of sexual abuse. That aside, this is an empowering book which never preaches, but encourages children to take control. </p> <p>David Almond's first book Skellig showed what a sensitive writer he is. In <strong> Kit's Wilderness </strong> (Hodder Children's Books, \u00a34.99) he uses the same light touch in a longer and more difficult novel about the loneliness of the outsider. Asquew is the leader of the boys who play the \"game of death\": there are shades of Lord of the Flies as the teenagers act out their private rituals on wasteland that was once a coalpit, but there is no underlying brutality, despite the privations of Asquew's background. Instead there is a fragile, mutual support.</p> <p>Almond understands how teenagers relate to one another, their need to posture and test each other as well as their need for warmth and protection and, above all, recognition. Kit's Wilderness evokes a time in adolescence when loyalties become confused that many will identify with. </p> <p>In <strong> Holes </strong> by Louis Sacher (Bloomsbury, \u00a310.99) all the boys are outsiders: outside the law, at any rate. A camp for young offenders in the Texan desert is an unlikely setting for an exceptionally funny and generous book that is also a tightly plotted detective novel.</p> <p>Sent there for a crime he did not commit, Stanley Yelnats accepts his fate placidly. Along with the other boys, he sets out every morning to dig his hole - five foot wide by five foot deep - in the dried-up bed of the lake. Digging holes is character-building, claims the Warden, but Stanley guesses there are other reasons. Stories from the past interweave with daily events at the camp; as Stanley discovers the secret behind the holes, the threads are unravelled. Without ever becoming mawkishly sentimental about the good within everyone, Sacher's young offenders are clearly more sinned against than sinning, and their developing relationships, fraught with hierarchy and petty jealousies, are minutely detailed and wholly absorbing. </p> <p>Anyone who has sneaked a peek at a teenager's diary - or, more honourably, remembers writing their own - will feel completely at home in Ros Asquith's <strong> The Teenage Worrier's Worry Files </strong> (Corgi, \u00a34.99). The fourth in the Teenage Worrier series (there are pocket guides as well) offers an update on the Worrier's family background, to make sure that new readers know where they are. No such guide is strictly necessary, as \"Letty Chubb, authorene\" writes so vividly that it is easy to pick up the threads.</p> <p>Friendships, school, boyz, spotz and much else figure in Letty's outpourings, which are as funny as they are accurate. Despite constant expressions of \"glume\" and feelings of frustration that the world is against her, the Worrier comes through life remarkably well, giving hope to other teenagers - and their parents. Letty's style is a neat combination of the crude and the literary, with a far more sizeable vocabulary than is commonly found in the grunted exchanges of Harry Enfield and his friends.</p> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501007109,00.html\">Buy Bloodtide at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501015339,00.html\">Buy Dosh at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502159953,00.html\">Buy Kit's Wilderness at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502355102,00.html\">Buy Holes at BOL</a><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501840384,00.html\">Buy The Teenage Worrier's Worry Files at BOL</a></p>",

Published when Jones was 26, it predated Alice Walker's The Color Purple and Toni Morrison's Beloved, revealing an unfinished emancipation and the power of historical memory to shape lives. It also marked a shift in African-American literature that made women, and relationships between black people, central. </p> <p>Corregidora (to be reissued by Serpent's Tail in July) was followed by Eva's Man (1976), whose heroine kills and mutilates her abusive lover, and the short story collection White Rat (1976). Admirers included Morrison, who edited her, James Baldwin, Maya Angelou and John Updike, who praised her sense of \"history in the blood\". </p> <p>But then she went silent. There was a hiatus of more than 20 years - during which she published only poetry and literary criticism - before she returned to fiction with The Healing. The novel was shortlisted for the National Book Award, but it also earned less welcome attention for a recluse who aspires to being known, \"like JD Salinger\", solely through her work.</p> <p>Her privacy was shattered when US press reports on The Healing alerted the law to her fugitive husband, with whom she had left a professorship in Michigan to go on the run in Europe in the 80s and who was now living with her in Kentucky. Convicted in absentia of assault and staked out in their home, he stabbed himself to death, leaving his wife to spend three weeks in hospital for \"psychiatric observation\". </p> <p>The new novel gives few clues either to Jones's spurning of fiction or to her embattled home life; its tone is lighter and more jocular than her early books (which she has rejected as \"man done her wrong-type blues novels\"). Still compelled by the southern speech and taut, sparring dialogue of the early fiction, it has a witty, savvy, sometimes cynical edge. </p> <p>Its truculent, demotic narrator is Harlan Jane Eagleton, a healer and race-track gambler, former beautician and ex-manager of singer Joan Savage, who \"mixes a little rap with her rock\". The tale is told backwards, from Harlan's fame as a greyhound-racing healer to the violent event that began her life as a layer-on of hands. </p> <p>Harlan, variously described as a \"picar\u00ed\" , \"coloured-girl adventuress\" and \"alley cat\", has left her medical anthropologist husband, Norvelle, in Africa. Deemed by his sister not to be a \"wifeable woman\", she takes up with a jockey named Paradise, an African-German race horse owner and Joan's ex-husband James - the source of incendiary friction with her client. </p> <p>Though the two women share traits, Joan appears the more intellectual. Harlan reflects: \"The type of romantic music I write she ridicules. She likes satire, wit, what she calls intelligent music.\" Yet a strong thread in the novel, which contains nods to Platonic philosophy, is about the difference between what people really are and the idea they, or others, have of them; what they are idealised - or underestimated - into being. James scorns Joan's career, thinking, as she puts it, \"that I'm just another stereotype. Playing the Nigger Entertainer... How does he know I ain't playing myself? Maybe that's who some of us are. Maybe I'm the Archetypal Nigger Entertainer and not the Stereotypical Nigger Entertainer.\" </p> <p>There is a self-consciousness to the tale, which includes a sceptics' chorus of the faithless and asides on aesthetics.

Into this fluid pastiche she mixes pop culture - Oprah, Denzel, Tina Turner - with allusions to Chaucer, Henry James, Ralph Ellison, Ishmael Reed. </p> <p>Here is Harlan on chivalry: \"Them women that don't wanna be on no pedestal... is kinda different from the women that ain't been on no pedestal.\" Or on French as the language of romance: \"Course if you's Algerian during that war, or an Algerian in France after the war, you wouldn't think of that French as a lover's language.\" </p> <p>Like Joan, Harlan is \"simply wanting to be my own woman\" rather than anyone else's idea of one. But redefining herself and her \"own ideals or possibilities of womanhood\" still leaves space for discovery - of \"the last man in the world I expected to find. Or maybe the first man I'd hoped for.\" </p> <p>The romantic plot, with its shadowy males and upbeat ending, its hint that \"when you discover you can heal yourself... you soon discover you can heal others\", is a far cry from Jones's fictional beginnings.

First there were sneers about his lines on the Paddington train crash, then he took another pasting in the \"cash for couplets\" affair over the sale of his millennium poem to a Sunday paper. Now Motion has confessed that he was also bullied as a child. </p> <p>In a tender poem called The Game written for Esther Rantzen's ChildLine charity, Motion describes how he was tied to a tree at the bottom of a garden by bigger boys who whipped him with bamboo canes. </p> <p>After his torturers, who were playing at being Japanese prisoner-of-war camp guards, had tired of whacking him on the back, he pulled up his dungarees and thanked them. \"When they eventually let me go/I still did not know/what to say except 'Thank you' - softly, admittedly, but 'Thank you'/all the same.\" </p> <p>The Game is undoubtedly his best public poem since he took on the difficult mantle of the laureateship in May. </p> <p>The poem evokes parallels with the very public hidings the painfully polite poet and biographer has recently taken. </p> <p>Only a few days ago Motion congratulated a rival biographer who attacked him for making up the main confession in his new fictionalised biography of the Regency poisoner Thomas Wainewright when one already existed in the archives.

      "bodyText": "Andrew Motion has been on the receiving end of several severe critical attacks since he was controversially made poet laureate last year. First there were sneers about his lines on the Paddington train crash, then he took another pasting in the \"cash for couplets\" affair over the sale of his millennium poem to a Sunday paper. Now Motion has confessed that he was also bullied as a child. In a tender poem called The Game written for Esther Rantzen's ChildLine charity, Motion describes how he was tied to a tree at the bottom of a garden by bigger boys who whipped him with bamboo canes. After his torturers, who were playing at being Japanese prisoner-of-war camp guards, had tired of whacking him on the back, he pulled up his dungarees and thanked them. \"When they eventually let me go/I still did not know/what to say except 'Thank you' - softly, admittedly, but 'Thank you'/all the same.\" The Game is undoubtedly his best public poem since he took on the difficult mantle of the laureateship in May. The poem evokes parallels with the very public hidings the painfully polite poet and biographer has recently taken. Only a few days ago Motion congratulated a rival biographer who attacked him for making up the main confession in his new fictionalised biography of the Regency poisoner Thomas Wainewright when one already existed in the archives. Motion said he was not aware of it and praised the scholarship of Marc Vaubert de Chantilly in finding it. Reviews of his book, Wainewright the Poisoner, have been lukewarm. Valerie Howarth, ChildLine's chief executive, said she found The Game deeply moving. \"It is obviously a very vivid personal memory of bullying. It is exceptionally valuable to have someone of Andrew Motion's distinction drawing attention to a problem which too often has been derided or dismissed as just a natural part of growing up.\" Ms Rantzen, who chairs the charity, was equally pleased. \"We felt we were chancing our arm a little when we asked the poet laureate to write a poem commemorating ChildLine helping its one millionth child,\" she said. \"So when the poem turned up we were thrilled. \"The fact that he has chosen to write so vividly and movingly about bullying, a prob lem which tops the list of what children call us about, will greatly help us in our work.

The publishers are surprisingly coy about it: repeated attempts to get a review copy proved futile. \"Er, who exactly was Sidney Webb?\" asked a Macmillan press officer.

Beatrice's upper-class background and reforming instincts drew her to charitable works, chiefly as a rent collector in workers' houses round the London docks. In her early 30s she fell passionately in love with the radical Liberal politician Joseph Chamberlain.</p> <p>Her sister warned her that marriage to him would be the \"murder of your independent nature\". The warning was compounded by the great dissenter himself, who turned out to be rather intolerant of dissent. \"You don't allow any division of opinion in your household, Mr Chamberlain?\" she asked him anxiously. His reply was first evasive and then plain. \"I can't help people thinking differently from me.\" \"But you don't allow the expression of difference?\" \"No.\" \"That little word ended our intercourse,\" Beatrice concluded, though it did not end the sleepless nights endlessly churning her erotic imagination.</p> <p>Two connected matters kept her safe from the great reformer after he married the daughter of the US secretary of state for war and drifted off into the Tory party.

The stern reality of ever-pressing starvation draws all together. Communism is a necessity of their life; they share all with one another, and as a class are quixotically generous. It is this virtue and the courage with which they face privation that lend a charm to life among them.\" She was fast moving away from the ruthless charity of the rent collector.</p> <p>Second came Sidney Webb: short, bearded, ugly and brilliant. His periodic depressions vanished as he fell immediately in love with her. He would not say No, as Chamberlain had done, or take No for an answer either. Her family warned her not to marry beneath her station, but eventually she gave way. \"If you lose at Deptford,\" she wrote to Sidney on the eve of his standing for election to the London County Council, \"I shall spend the whole day kissing you.\" He won triumphantly, and the kissing probably went on anyway.</p> <p>Two mighty books were the result of this momentous partnership - The History of Trade Unionism (1894) and Industrial Democracy (1897).

It informed and delighted people as far apart as Lenin and Edward Bernstein, father of German reformism.</p> <p>Harrison is not a hagiographer. He can see the weaknesses in the Webbs as clearly as their strengths. He exposes their shifting priorities, and ties them firmly to the moods of the workers: rising high when the workers' struggles reached their peaks, as in the great dock strike of 1889, and plunging low into prime-ministerial dinner parties and shameless imperialism during the employers' counter-offensive at the turn of the century.</p> <p>Anyone who believes in a law of progress should ponder the achievements of the Webbs, and what happened in the century that followed.

Because, as I said a couple of weeks back with reference to the rag trade's about-face when it comes to fur, in fashion there is only one rule: Does it look good? If it does, be it the pelt of a tortured animal or Nazi insignia, it must be \"good\". If not, though ever so virtuous, it's simply a waste of space. This is the impeccable pretzel logic of fashionistas that brings us back to them time and time again when searching for a suitable recipient for the Cretin of the Century commemorative fruit-bowl. </p> <p>I was still gurgling with delight over Dazed &amp; Confused's dazed confusion when I saw one of those new Benetton billboards, the ones featuring the faces of the poor oofums currently cooling their heels on America's Death Row, which have been erected in the hope of selling yet a few more stripy jumpers to a few more Swiss students. In Benetton's attempt to boost sales of their supernaturally banal woollies by linking them with matters of life and death (\"I've got a new blue jumper! Therefore, I'm helping cure Aids/stop racism/abolish the death penalty!\"), we see the true, glorious folly of fashion trying to think about anything bigger than the size of its butt or further away than the end of its bobbed nose. </p> <p>Yet even here it is as woolly as its own jumpers, and operating to the same old liberal consensus splashed with a bit of Kensington Gore. Fashion is notoriously prone to protecting its own, and though I have no way of proving it, I'd bet that if the killer of Gianni Versace - Andrew Cunanan - had not turned his gun upon himself, no way would Benetton ever dream of putting his mug up there for all to sympathise with. Gianni, you see, was an artist; the poor gimps these handsome guys killed were just civilians , who probably didn't even know the difference between taupe and greige! </p> <p>I have no problem with people protesting against the use of the death penalty in the US, but I do think that they are, for the most part, incredibly dishonest. In all pictorial pleas against it, we only ever see the face of the poor Joe waiting to be fried; in all his isolated and imperfect humanity, shorn of all worldly goods, he can't help but seem a little Christlike. What we never see is any reference to the events that got him on to Death Row in the first place. How much more shocking and truthful it would be if, instead of just the face of the killer, we saw the following: X [picture of killer] is due to die for doing this [photograph of the victim's body at the scene of the crime] and this [press photograph of victim's immediate family and friends at funeral, their agony clearly visible on their faces] to Y [picture of victim, preferably happy and smiling, ideally blowing out candles at most recent birthday party]. </p> <p>See? It's so much more upsetting, and so much more honest. But you won't ever see it, because there has always been a tendency among abolitionists to play down the humanity of the victims of convicted killers (\"Oh well, they're dead! Nothing more can hurt them!\" - ignoring, of course, the constant pain and grief of their loved ones living on) in order to boost the humanity quotient of the killer. (\"There, but for fortune, go you or I!\") But what you get from this is an extremely skewed set of values that actively champion the rights of the strong over the weak. </p> <p> In the new Tom Hanks film, The Green Mile, not one of the crimes of the gentle-giant killers on Death Row is thought suitable for our delicate ears - not one! This was a mistake, and only had the effect of making one try to work out which one was the child-rapist and which one the serial killer of old ladies. In other words, by attempting to draw a veil over the crimes of the \"heroes\", they actually made it worse. </p> <p>No group has a greater built-in bullshit detector than the young, which is why less than 48 per cent of under 25s in this country are registered to vote in the next election. And I notice that support for capital punishment is now highest among the young on both sides of the Atlantic, who are invariably the most liberal on other issues. I cannot help but feel that the mistakes of the abolition lobby have contributed greatly to this. It is a simplistic notion, yet one increasingly accepted, that the most recent victim of violence in any situation is the real victim; thus the killer on Death Row is more important than his innocent victim, or the destruction of Dresden far wickeder than the Luftwaffe's earlier destruction of Coventry. </p> <p>But killers do not simply wake up one morning, like Josef K, innocent dupes of an evil system, and Dresden didn't happen because Churchill woke up one morning in a lousy mood. When they choose evil, people choose their paths, whether they end up on Death Row or in the Luftwaffe. To deny this is not just to commit terrible disrespect towards all the poor, wretched and backward Americans who do not commit any violence whatsoever, and to all the Germans who did not follow Hitler. And for us to stand in the shoes of the violent criminal, in uniform or in prison drab, and attempt to portray them as innocent victims of Fortuna is, I feel, to rob even wrong-doers of the little dignity they possess. But then, what would fashion types know about dignity?</p>",

How much more shocking and truthful it would be if, instead of just the face of the killer, we saw the following: X [picture of killer] is due to die for doing this [photograph of the victim's body at the scene of the crime] and this [press photograph of victim's immediate family and friends at funeral, their agony clearly visible on their faces] to Y [picture of victim, preferably happy and smiling, ideally blowing out candles at most recent birthday party]. See? It's so much more upsetting, and so much more honest. But you won't ever see it, because there has always been a tendency among abolitionists to play down the humanity of the victims of convicted killers (\"Oh well, they're dead! Nothing more can hurt them!\" - ignoring, of course, the constant pain and grief of their loved ones living on) in order to boost the humanity quotient of the killer. (\"There, but for fortune, go you or I!\") But what you get from this is an extremely skewed set of values that actively champion the rights of the strong over the weak. In the new Tom Hanks film, The Green Mile, not one of the crimes of the gentle-giant killers on Death Row is thought suitable for our delicate ears - not one! This was a mistake, and only had the effect of making one try to work out which one was the child-rapist and which one the serial killer of old ladies. In other words, by attempting to draw a veil over the crimes of the \"heroes\", they actually made it worse. No group has a greater built-in bullshit detector than the young, which is why less than 48 per cent of under 25s in this country are registered to vote in the next election. And I notice that support for capital punishment is now highest among the young on both sides of the Atlantic, who are invariably the most liberal on other issues. I cannot help but feel that the mistakes of the abolition lobby have contributed greatly to this. It is a simplistic notion, yet one increasingly accepted, that the most recent victim of violence in any situation is the real victim; thus the killer on Death Row is more important than his innocent victim, or the destruction of Dresden far wickeder than the Luftwaffe's earlier destruction of Coventry. But killers do not simply wake up one morning, like Josef K, innocent dupes of an evil system, and Dresden didn't happen because Churchill woke up one morning in a lousy mood. When they choose evil, people choose their paths, whether they end up on Death Row or in the Luftwaffe. To deny this is not just to commit terrible disrespect towards all the poor, wretched and backward Americans who do not commit any violence whatsoever, and to all the Germans who did not follow Hitler. And for us to stand in the shoes of the violent criminal, in uniform or in prison drab, and attempt to portray them as innocent victims of Fortuna is, I feel, to rob even wrong-doers of the little dignity they possess. But then, what would fashion types know about dignity?",

      "body": "<p>\u0095 Soon after the second world war, two majors in the British army, on their way home for demobilisation, met in a bar in Tournai. They had known each other at Oxford and began to discuss what they might do when the war was over. One, who was Labour, said he meant to become a politician. The other, a Tory, was unsure. He thought he might become an orchestral conductor. Four years later, they met again on the hustings in the 1950 election. The Labour man was conceding defeat to the Tory. The seat was Bexley; the Labour man, Ashley Bramall; the Tory, Edward Heath, who this week completed a 50-year stint in the Commons. What a frightful place the Commons is sometimes, though. I heard the exchanges when Teresa Gorman was being debated: the Tory bigwig Sir Peter Tapsell braying away about her being a combative and zany lady and then adding that he'd known quite a lot of combative and zany ladies in his long life. And immediately all that dreadful clubland chortling, no doubt on the calculation that s-e-x was raising its head. </p> <p>\u0095 There are divisions in the Church of England, I see, over dress. Traditionalists, the Times reported this week, remain wedded to ornate chasubles, copes and stoles, but radicals wear just about anything: one Mancunian officiates in a combat jacket, leather trousers and boots. As a church official commented: \"Vestments are part of the layers of mystery.\" Since reading all this, I have caught myself brooding on chasubles. What, apart from a canon in Oscar Wilde, is a chasuble? A conical cape, the authorities say, with a hole to put your head through, and seams reinforced by decorated strips of material called orphreys. Orphrey would make a splendid name for a canon, too. A merchant of ecclesiastical vestments advertises albs, chasubles and stoles. An alb, it's explained, is a long white tunic down to the ankles, while a stole, as in lay couture, is a stole. An amice is a simple scarf of white linen or wool worn under the alb (though radicals no doubt wear it over the alb, to show they are radicals). There used to be something called a dalmatic - a garment of wool or linen reaching the knee with baggy elbow-length sleeves. What a rich world this is, and so unexplored. </p> <p>\u0095 But costume is not the only mystery now dividing the church. The word \"ek\" is another. Apparently they've been debating the meaning of that for two years. The blame for this lies less with the synod than with the Greeks, who devised a word which equally means \"by\", \"of\" or \"from\". I shall look with new respect from now on at the north country exclamation \"by ek\", which always seemed plain before, but which I now have to add to my list of ecclesiastical mysteries. The same report on the synod's debate on the Nicene Creed, in which \"ek\" is embedded, quotes someone called Bruinvel as saying:\"We should keep the creed as it is. It has lasted years and years.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Soon after the second world war, two majors in the British army, on their way home for demobilisation, met in a bar in Tournai. They had known each other at Oxford and began to discuss what they might do when the war was over. One, who was Labour, said he meant to become a politician. The other, a Tory, was unsure. He thought he might become an orchestral conductor. Four years later, they met again on the hustings in the 1950 election. The Labour man was conceding defeat to the Tory. The seat was Bexley; the Labour man, Ashley Bramall; the Tory, Edward Heath, who this week completed a 50-year stint in the Commons. What a frightful place the Commons is sometimes, though. I heard the exchanges when Teresa Gorman was being debated: the Tory bigwig Sir Peter Tapsell braying away about her being a combative and zany lady and then adding that he'd known quite a lot of combative and zany ladies in his long life. And immediately all that dreadful clubland chortling, no doubt on the calculation that s-e-x was raising its head. \u0095 There are divisions in the Church of England, I see, over dress. Traditionalists, the Times reported this week, remain wedded to ornate chasubles, copes and stoles, but radicals wear just about anything: one Mancunian officiates in a combat jacket, leather trousers and boots. As a church official commented: \"Vestments are part of the layers of mystery.\" Since reading all this, I have caught myself brooding on chasubles. What, apart from a canon in Oscar Wilde, is a chasuble? A conical cape, the authorities say, with a hole to put your head through, and seams reinforced by decorated strips of material called orphreys. Orphrey would make a splendid name for a canon, too. A merchant of ecclesiastical vestments advertises albs, chasubles and stoles. An alb, it's explained, is a long white tunic down to the ankles, while a stole, as in lay couture, is a stole. An amice is a simple scarf of white linen or wool worn under the alb (though radicals no doubt wear it over the alb, to show they are radicals). There used to be something called a dalmatic - a garment of wool or linen reaching the knee with baggy elbow-length sleeves. What a rich world this is, and so unexplored. \u0095 But costume is not the only mystery now dividing the church. The word \"ek\" is another. Apparently they've been debating the meaning of that for two years. The blame for this lies less with the synod than with the Greeks, who devised a word which equally means \"by\", \"of\" or \"from\". I shall look with new respect from now on at the north country exclamation \"by ek\", which always seemed plain before, but which I now have to add to my list of ecclesiastical mysteries. The same report on the synod's debate on the Nicene Creed, in which \"ek\" is embedded, quotes someone called Bruinvel as saying:\"We should keep the creed as it is. It has lasted years and years. Why change it now?\" Here is another mystery. What is a Bruinvel? Could it be the singular form of the former Tory MP Peter Bruinvels who, before he succumbed to the rise of Labour, declared himself, in his zeal for capital punishment, ready to carry out the work of the hangman if no other volunteer could be found? Curious (Cricklewood) writes : What is a thurifer? Smallweed knowledgeably responds: It's an acolyte who carries a thurible. Curious (Cricklewood) counters: What, in that case, is a thurible? Smallweed impatiently snaps: It is something a thurifer carries. \u0095 Enough of ecclesiastical matters. I deeply deplore the behaviour of banks in trying to exploit the need of the public to draw money from holes in the wall owned by other people's providers. This has led to an undesirable torrent of references on the BBC to something they call \"withdrawral\".

The thrush nightingale: like the song nightingale, it repeats little phrases in its song. And that? The golden oriel. And that? The scarlet rosefinch. And that? My washing machine going through its spin cycle. And if you listen really carefully I think you can hear - yes! - that's a black T-shirt mixed in with the whites. Damn! </p> <p>It was May in Poland, and Oddie was wandering through its abundant wetlands. He used to be a corncrake in the 70s, an awkward-looking bird who made odd rasping sounds. His natural habitat was in a field with Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden. He then affected, paradoxically, the odd strutting walk of a rooster in platforms. Next he was like a smaller, more flighty Harry Secombe, though less devoted to the raspberry (parp!) in his characteristic song. Thirty years later in Birding with Bill Oddie (BBC2), he has mellowed into a thrush nightingale - pleasingly repetitive and easy on the ear. </p> <p>Oddie and Polish bird expert Marek Borkowski stood on their jeep looking across the marshes. They adjusted their lenses and hoped to see aquatic warblers holding secret philosophy discussion groups in the long grass. \"Run dum dip id ip,\" said Marek, though whether he was imitating the song of the aquatic warbler or inventing a new dialect wasn't clear. \"Oh flip,\" said Bill excitedly as he pulled the focus on his camera. </p> <p>It's nice to hear people say \"flip\", that old word from the lexicon of sanitised TV, resuscitated for a gaudier age in which swearing is commonplace and games shows such as Prickly Heat (Sky 1) consist of show-offs running across beaches with ice cubes crammed into their bikini bottoms. Isn't it? Too flipping right it is. </p> <p>But Bill and Marek were looking in the wrong direction. The aquatic warblers? They were in Marek's luxuriant beard, that soft matted number containing all the warmth and nesting materials the birds needed to get them through the cool spring evening. </p> <p>This was a lovely half hour, one of those mildly educative programmes broadcast on Friday evenings that are muted and beautifully photographed. I was lulled into a cat nap by the sound of the middle-spotted woodpecker, only to be rudely awakened by the corncrake's distinctive \"Kirsch-chucka-whascha\". That's why corncrakes disappeared from Britain: it was nothing to do with farming methods; they were strangled by dozy lumps like me. </p> <p>I could hear the Bialowieza forest growing and rotting in the spectral calm of this programme. I could hear insects being born in their millions and being eaten by a variety of birdlife much richer than that of Britain, that home of industrialised agriculture and decimated woodlands. The appeal of Poland for Oddie was that one could see there the birds of Victorian England - among them the yellowhammer, the red-banded shrike, and, my favourite, the big-bearded tough. In this rural Poland there were a pair of horses pulling a plough guided by the farmer on foot. Not the sort of thing you see as you speed up the M1. </p> <p>This was a fanciful Poland, but more pleasant to look at for that. \"It's not so much the sights as the sounds of Poland I'll remember. There wasn't a moment in which I couldn't hear birdsong,\" said Oddie, and he spoke for me too. Now, for instance, if you listen carefully, you can hear the great reed warbler chuntering and the river warbler like a busy sewing machine as the sun sets behind the closing credits. </p> <p>On Sky Sports Interactive they have birdwatching, too. It's called the PlayerCam and what it involves is quite interesting. During a football match you push a few buttons on your digital handset and, instead of watching the game from the touchline, you can follow a single player as he tries to hide himself like a shy corncrake near the centre circle. To my mind, this new facility involves too many close-ups of Alan Shearer hawking into the turf and nameless midfielders picking their noses when they think - crazy fools! - that they are not being watched. Have these vulgarians never heard of hankies? Isn't it amazing that our footballers don't use their massively inflated salaries to buy a few Ultra-Balm tissues and ask their shirt designers to tailor sleeves in which to tuck the used ones discreetly?</p>",

This was remarkable given the fact that Portugal has been spending tens of millions of pounds in assisting East Timor to recover from the massive devastation caused by Indonesia in the wake of the referendum for independence.</p> <p>In Mozambique, Portugal was soon overtaken by Britain and others, a fact that is appreciated in Portugal. But it has given rise to a national controversy over whether Portugal, instead of using its modest resources in East Timor, should try and rally international support to press Indonesia to pay adequate reparations to the Timorese for the devastation. The proceeds would release funds for more aid to Mozambique and it would be in keeping with the policy of reconciliation started by the new Indonesian government. The transfer would make an important moral distinction between the man-made tragedy in East Timor and the ecological disaster Mozambicans are suffering. <br><b> Antonio de Figueiredo </b><br> London</p> <p>\u0095 The US has a massive naval base in nearby Diego Garcia.

      "bodyText": "Contrary to Martin Woollacott's passing reference, in his otherwise excellent article on the belated aid to Mozambique (Comment, March 3), Portugal was the first country to send a donation of \u00a32m to Mozambique, a member of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries as well as the Commonwealth. This was remarkable given the fact that Portugal has been spending tens of millions of pounds in assisting East Timor to recover from the massive devastation caused by Indonesia in the wake of the referendum for independence. In Mozambique, Portugal was soon overtaken by Britain and others, a fact that is appreciated in Portugal. But it has given rise to a national controversy over whether Portugal, instead of using its modest resources in East Timor, should try and rally international support to press Indonesia to pay adequate reparations to the Timorese for the devastation. The proceeds would release funds for more aid to Mozambique and it would be in keeping with the policy of reconciliation started by the new Indonesian government. The transfer would make an important moral distinction between the man-made tragedy in East Timor and the ecological disaster Mozambicans are suffering. Antonio de Figueiredo London \u0095 The US has a massive naval base in nearby Diego Garcia. To my knowledge they have not sent even a single helicopter. Jenny Rathbone London Jenny.Rathbone@islington. gov.uk \u0095 Perhaps we need to ask when nearby rich countries, for example Saudi Arabia, are going to shoulder some of the responsibility in helping those who are unable to help themselves.

Or, conversely, was he beginning to negotiate a deal, which could lead to Mr Dobson standing down and Mr Livingstone inheriting the nomination? That may seem appealing to Ken, but it would be less so to the Londoners who like the former GLC leader precisely because he is the man against the machine - not the beneficiary of backroom dealmaking. All this delay is clearly taking its toll on Mr Livingstone - he looked uncharacteristically tense on Thursday - but it will also sap the goodwill of his potential voters.

      "body": "<b>The challenge</b> <p><b> A young vegetarian family is too busy to rustle up anything other than quick, uninspired weekday meals. The youngest daughter has leukaemia, so needs an immune system-boosting diet to help stave off bugs. They begged the kitchen doctor to teach them some tasty alternatives to their routine fare . . .</b> </p> <p>Axminster: 5,600 souls, market on Thursday, voluminous quantities of prime British carpet and, one day last month, a distinguished visitor of the culino-medical variety. As the sun rose on that day, Rosie Sykes, Kitchen Doctor, was speeding west from London on another foodie mercy dash. Destination was the home of the Austin family - Julie, Bill and daughters Kez, 11, and Mattie, just two-and-a-bit - in a hamlet a mile out of town. </p> <p>The Austin household is special in several respects, but most relevant for KD purposes is that Mattie has leukaemia, they don't eat meat or fish, and their lives have become extremely hurried. Steering a course around the food foibles of two kids is a thankless task at the best of times, but add the disciplines imposed by serious illness while keeping to a strictly vegetarian diet, and creative cooking, day in, day out, becomes almost impossible. Or, as Julie phrased it, \"Please help. We need fast food for vegetarians. The most common phrase in our house is, 'Oh no, not pasta again!' And jacket potatoes are considered a treat!\" </p> <p>It's 11.30am. Outside Austin Towers, the thrum of a hot engine is followed by the plod of KD feet. Salvation in time for lunch? Maybe. Rosie, ever the expert, offers her professional opinion as to the likelihood of the Austin's experiencing an eating-something-pretty-damned-quick scenario: \"Um, we have to do some shopping for food.\" Ah, yes, food: so often the overlooked element in any meal. KD piles back into the car and, five minutes later, is prodding produce at Millers farm shop. </p> <p>Soon, she has secured 90% of her requirements: two boxes of the freshest veg, and all at a snip. But the polenta was hiding. Axminster town beckoned. Sadly, the words \"shopping\" and \"Axminster\" are coming to mean just one thing: Tesco. New Britain's favourite supermarket recently opened a branch here, one that has been separating the people of Axminster from their pennies with the usual efficiency. It's not exactly Thomas Hardy, and you can't help but wonder what the prospects are for the region's independent traders. Still, at least we found some polenta. </p> <p>Back at Austin Towers, things begin to happen. Kez sets about chopping four onions and, despite a torrent of tears, presses on, knowing that through her discomfort would come happiness for all. Or something like that. Mattie, wisely, is treating the whole circus with caution, and retires for crisis talks with Postman Pat. \"I cook pasta all the time,\" confesses Julie once more as the cheese pancakes take shape, \"but everyone complains.\" </p> <p>\"You cook it too much!\" interjects Kez earnestly, making sure the point is not lost. It isn't. With unashamed glee, the KD, now finding her pace and possessed of a devilish grin, produces her collection of big, sharp knives. It's time to get serious. </p> <p>An hour later, there's a rich mix of smells wafting around the house: a hint of coriander, a touch of honey and sesame seed. On the table, a tray of polenta lies prone; in the oven, foil parcels of veg hiss gently to themselves, and a nut bake bakes. The febrile goings-on lure Mattie back for a look, just in time for the highlight of the day. From somewhere, a pastry cutter in the form of Po Teletubby is produced; two or three times it is pressed into the polenta, each time with a primitive murmur of approval from the slavering onlookers. Finally, the small Po figures are placed in a frying pan and left to their fate, monitored by Mattie with such nonchalance that you wonder if ritualistic Po-frying is a regular feature of life in this part of Devon. And that, more or less, was where KD called it a day. But how did it taste? Smiles all round is how it tasted. </p> <p> All recipes serve four. </p> <p> Recipes consist of five basics (polenta; couscous; cottage-cheese pancakes; nut bake) and various complementary dishes. Mix and match, depending on what you feel like on the day. </p> <p><b>Polenta</b></p> <p> Buy quick-cook polenta and follow the instructions: it's usually about 500g polenta to 1.5l salted water (the salt is important, otherwise it is very bland). Bring the water to the boil, add a large knob of butter or good glug of olive oil, then pour in the polenta steadily, stirring all the while. Now add some cheese: either Parmesan or, for a punchier flavour, blue cheese or soft goat's cheese. Stir until the polenta is stiff and starts to leave the sides of the pan; usually four to five minutes. Pour on to a lined baking sheet and leave to cool for 30 minutes. To finish, cut the cold polenta into circles or triangles, place in a hot, oiled frying pan or under the grill, and cook until golden on both sides. </p> <p><b>Couscous</b></p> <p> Bring 250ml stock or water to the boil, pour into a bowl containing 250ml by volume couscous, stir, cover and leave for 10 minutes, so the grain can absorb the liquid. Flavour the stock with chillies, herbs or spices; alternatively, when the couscous has puffed up a bit, dress with olive oil, lemon juice and herbs. Serve warm or cold (you can make it in advance, and reheat gently). Stir in some nuts or olives as well, if you fancy. </p> <p><b>Cottage cheese pancakes</b></p> <p> <b> 55g self-raising flour </b></p> <p><b>Salt and black pepper </b></p> <p><b>25g softened butter </b></p> <p><b>110g cottage cheese </b></p> <p><b>2 large eggs, lightly beaten </b></p> <p><b>2-3 tbsp milk</b> </p> <p>Season the flour, tip it into a blender and add the butter and cheese. Whizz for a couple of minutes, then pour in the eggs and milk, to slacken the batter. Leave to rest for 10 minutes, then cook in a hot, lightly oiled frying pan just as you would normal pancakes. </p> <p><b> Nut bake </b></p> <p>The dull name belies a very tasty dish - a far cry from bland nut roast of yore. </p> <p><b> 25g butter (or 2 tbsp olive oil) </b></p> <p><b>1 onion, chopped </b></p> <p><b>225g mixed nuts, chopped (I use mostly pinenuts, and a mixture of cashews and ground hazelnuts) </b></p> <p><b>100g white breadcrumbs </b></p> <p><b>2 large eggs </b></p> <p><b>4 tbsp milk</b> </p> <p>For the stuffing </p> <p><b> 175g soft brown breadcrumbs </b></p> <p><b>6 tbsp olive oil (or 75g butter) </b></p> <p><b>lemon, juiced and zested </b></p> <p><b>4 tbsp chopped mixed fresh herbs (sage, parsley, thyme, rosemary, perhaps even a little watercress)</b> </p> <p>To finish </p> <p><b> 50g butter </b></p> <p><b>25g finely ground mixed nuts </b></p> <p><b>25g soft brown breadcrumbs</b> </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. In a frying pan, sweat the onion in butter until soft. Tip into a bowl, leave to cool for a minute or two, then add the nuts, breadcrumbs, eggs and milk. </p> <p>In a separate bowl, mix together the stuffing ingredients. Butter a baking tin, and dust with the ground nuts and breadcrumbs. Spread half the nut mix in the base of the tin, spread with stuffing, then cover with the remaining nut mixture. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Serve hot or warm. </p> <p><b> Cannellini beans with leek, celeriac and mustard</b> </p> <p> <b> 2 tbsp olive oil or 25g butter </b></p> <p><b>3 leeks, washed and cut into rings </b></p> <p><b>1 celeriac, peeled and cut in chunks </b></p> <p><b>Vegetable stock (or water) </b></p> <p><b>1 tin cannellini beans, drained </b></p> <p><b>3 tbsp grain mustard </b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp cr\u00e8me frache (optional) </b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp chives, chopped fine</b> </p> <p>Heat the butter or oil in a frying pan, add the leeks and celeriac, and saut\u00e9 gently for a couple of minutes. Pour in enough stock or water to cover, season and simmer until the vegetables are almost tender. Add the beans and mustard, and continue simmering for five minutes longer (add more stock if necessary). </p> <p>Remove a quarter of the mixture and whizz it up in a blender until smooth. Add the cr\u00e8me frache to the pur\u00e9e, then stir back into the pan. Add the chives, and serve with any of the basics - it goes especially well with the nut bake and pancakes. </p> <p><b>Spanish-style chickpea and pumpkin casserole</b></p> <p> <b> 150g pumpkin, peeled and diced </b></p> <p><b>3 pears, peeled, cored and diced </b></p> <p><b>400g tinned chickpeas, drained </b></p> <p><b>250g green beans, topped and tailed </b></p> <p><b>100ml olive oil </b></p> <p><b>1 white onion, peeled and chopped </b></p> <p><b>1 tsp paprika </b></p> <p><b>150ml chopped tinned tomato </b></p> <p><b>1 small slice white bread, diced </b></p> <p><b>2 clove garlic, peeled and crushed </b></p> <p><b>10 almonds toasted </b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp hot vegetable stock </b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp sherry vinegar</b> </p> <p>Fill a pan with water to cover the first four ingredients, bring to the boil and drop in the pumpkin. Bring back to the boil, simmer for five minutes, add the pears, return to the boil again, then add the chickpeas. Simmer for 25 minutes. Add the beans and simmer until tender. </p> <p>Meanwhile, heat 50ml olive oil in a pan and fry the onion until golden. Add the paprika and tomato, and cook until the liquid is reduced by half. Heat the rest of the oil in another pan, fry the bread and garlic until golden, then tip into a blender, add the almonds and whizz to a paste. Slowly add the stock and vinegar to the paste. Tip the tomato mix into the vegetable pot, then stir in the garlic-and-nut paste to thicken the sauce. </p> <p><b>Vegetable bourride</b></p> <p>Only buy asparagus and Jerusalem artichoke when in season - what's on offer at other times is very second-rate.</p> <p><b> 750ml vegetable stock </b></p> <p><b>1 cauliflower, broken into florets </b></p> <p><b>1 head broccoli, broken into spears </b></p> <p><b>250g new potatoes, scrubbed and cut into quarters </b></p> <p><b>4 Jerusalem artichokes, peeled and sliced </b></p> <p><b>2 courgettes, cut in half and sliced </b></p> <p><b>1 bunch of asparagus, peeled </b></p> <p><b>2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed </b></p> <p><b>100g mayonnaise </b></p> <p><b>Chives and parsley, chopped fine</b> </p> <p>In a big pot, bring the stock to the boil, season, then blanch the vegetables one by one until cooked. Remove with a slotted spoon, drain, and keep warm in a low oven. Whizz the garlic and mayonnaise in a blender, then, once all the vegetables are cooked, add 300ml of the stock and blend again. Place the veg on a platter, pour over the garlicky sauce and sprinkle with the herbs. </p> <p><b>Mushroom, spinach and pinenuts</b></p> <p> <b> 2 cloves garlic, peeled and grated </b></p> <p><b>3 shallots, peeled and chopped fine </b></p> <p><b>225g mixed mushrooms, cleaned and chopped into good-sized pieces </b></p> <p><b>500g baby spinach (or frozen) </b></p> <p><b>85g pinenuts, gently toasted </b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp olive oil</b> </p> <p>Heat half the oil in a pan, and gently saut\u00e9 the garlic, shallots and mushrooms. When they are soft, add the spinach and let it wilt. Season, then add the nuts and the remaining olive oil. Serve with any of the basics. </p> <p><b>Root vegetables en papillote</b></p> <p> <b> 50g butter </b></p> <p><b>12 cloves garlic, still in their skins </b></p> <p><b>A selection of: shallots, peeled but kept whole; carrots, parsnips, new potatoes, turnips, swede, sweet potato, peeled and chopped into even-sized pieces </b></p> <p><b>Zest and juice of 1 lemon </b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp brandy (optional) </b></p> <p><b>125ml vegetable stock (water) </b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp honey </b></p> <p><b>100-150g cooked chestnuts, chopped (optional) </b></p> <p><b>Fresh rosemary or thyme</b> </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6.

Add the remaining vegetables, season and saut\u00e9 for a few minutes longer. Divide the fried vegetables between the tinfoil parcels. </p> <p>Put the rest of the butter in the pan, add the lemon juice and zest, brandy, stock and honey, bring to the boil, and simmer until reduced. Spoon a little into each package, add the chestnuts and a sprig or two of rosemary or thyme. </p> <p>Pull the edges of the foil together and fold over to seal. Place on a baking tray, and bake for 20 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.

Cottage cheese pancakes 55g self-raising flour Salt and black pepper 25g softened butter 110g cottage cheese 2 large eggs, lightly beaten 2-3 tbsp milk Season the flour, tip it into a blender and add the butter and cheese. Whizz for a couple of minutes, then pour in the eggs and milk, to slacken the batter. Leave to rest for 10 minutes, then cook in a hot, lightly oiled frying pan just as you would normal pancakes. Nut bake The dull name belies a very tasty dish - a far cry from bland nut roast of yore. 25g butter (or 2 tbsp olive oil) 1 onion, chopped 225g mixed nuts, chopped (I use mostly pinenuts, and a mixture of cashews and ground hazelnuts) 100g white breadcrumbs 2 large eggs 4 tbsp milk For the stuffing 175g soft brown breadcrumbs 6 tbsp olive oil (or 75g butter) lemon, juiced and zested 4 tbsp chopped mixed fresh herbs (sage, parsley, thyme, rosemary, perhaps even a little watercress) To finish 50g butter 25g finely ground mixed nuts 25g soft brown breadcrumbs Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. In a frying pan, sweat the onion in butter until soft. Tip into a bowl, leave to cool for a minute or two, then add the nuts, breadcrumbs, eggs and milk. In a separate bowl, mix together the stuffing ingredients. Butter a baking tin, and dust with the ground nuts and breadcrumbs. Spread half the nut mix in the base of the tin, spread with stuffing, then cover with the remaining nut mixture. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Serve hot or warm. Cannellini beans with leek, celeriac and mustard 2 tbsp olive oil or 25g butter 3 leeks, washed and cut into rings 1 celeriac, peeled and cut in chunks Vegetable stock (or water) 1 tin cannellini beans, drained 3 tbsp grain mustard 2 tbsp cr\u00e8me frache (optional) 2 tbsp chives, chopped fine Heat the butter or oil in a frying pan, add the leeks and celeriac, and saut\u00e9 gently for a couple of minutes. Pour in enough stock or water to cover, season and simmer until the vegetables are almost tender. Add the beans and mustard, and continue simmering for five minutes longer (add more stock if necessary). Remove a quarter of the mixture and whizz it up in a blender until smooth. Add the cr\u00e8me frache to the pur\u00e9e, then stir back into the pan. Add the chives, and serve with any of the basics - it goes especially well with the nut bake and pancakes. Spanish-style chickpea and pumpkin casserole 150g pumpkin, peeled and diced 3 pears, peeled, cored and diced 400g tinned chickpeas, drained 250g green beans, topped and tailed 100ml olive oil 1 white onion, peeled and chopped 1 tsp paprika 150ml chopped tinned tomato 1 small slice white bread, diced 2 clove garlic, peeled and crushed 10 almonds toasted 2 tbsp hot vegetable stock 2 tbsp sherry vinegar Fill a pan with water to cover the first four ingredients, bring to the boil and drop in the pumpkin. Bring back to the boil, simmer for five minutes, add the pears, return to the boil again, then add the chickpeas. Simmer for 25 minutes. Add the beans and simmer until tender. Meanwhile, heat 50ml olive oil in a pan and fry the onion until golden. Add the paprika and tomato, and cook until the liquid is reduced by half. Heat the rest of the oil in another pan, fry the bread and garlic until golden, then tip into a blender, add the almonds and whizz to a paste. Slowly add the stock and vinegar to the paste. Tip the tomato mix into the vegetable pot, then stir in the garlic-and-nut paste to thicken the sauce. Vegetable bourride Only buy asparagus and Jerusalem artichoke when in season - what's on offer at other times is very second-rate. 750ml vegetable stock 1 cauliflower, broken into florets 1 head broccoli, broken into spears 250g new potatoes, scrubbed and cut into quarters 4 Jerusalem artichokes, peeled and sliced 2 courgettes, cut in half and sliced 1 bunch of asparagus, peeled 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed 100g mayonnaise Chives and parsley, chopped fine In a big pot, bring the stock to the boil, season, then blanch the vegetables one by one until cooked. Remove with a slotted spoon, drain, and keep warm in a low oven. Whizz the garlic and mayonnaise in a blender, then, once all the vegetables are cooked, add 300ml of the stock and blend again. Place the veg on a platter, pour over the garlicky sauce and sprinkle with the herbs. Mushroom, spinach and pinenuts 2 cloves garlic, peeled and grated 3 shallots, peeled and chopped fine 225g mixed mushrooms, cleaned and chopped into good-sized pieces 500g baby spinach (or frozen) 85g pinenuts, gently toasted 2 tbsp olive oil Heat half the oil in a pan, and gently saut\u00e9 the garlic, shallots and mushrooms. When they are soft, add the spinach and let it wilt. Season, then add the nuts and the remaining olive oil. Serve with any of the basics. Root vegetables en papillote 50g butter 12 cloves garlic, still in their skins A selection of: shallots, peeled but kept whole; carrots, parsnips, new potatoes, turnips, swede, sweet potato, peeled and chopped into even-sized pieces Zest and juice of 1 lemon 2 tbsp brandy (optional) 125ml vegetable stock (water) 1 tbsp honey 100-150g cooked chestnuts, chopped (optional) Fresh rosemary or thyme Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6. Cut four squares of tinfoil, and lift each one in the corners to form a sort of container. Saut\u00e9 the garlic, shallots and carrots in half the butter until lightly browned. Add the remaining vegetables, season and saut\u00e9 for a few minutes longer. Divide the fried vegetables between the tinfoil parcels. Put the rest of the butter in the pan, add the lemon juice and zest, brandy, stock and honey, bring to the boil, and simmer until reduced. Spoon a little into each package, add the chestnuts and a sprig or two of rosemary or thyme. Pull the edges of the foil together and fold over to seal. Place on a baking tray, and bake for 20 minutes, until the vegetables are tender. Serve straight from the packages, or turn out on to plates. Simple tomato sauce 3 cloves garlic 3 sticks celery 3 carrots 2 onions 2 tbsp olive oil 14oz chopped tin tomatoes 1 bouquet garni Crush the garlic, chop the vegetables quite fine and saut\u00e9 in the oil. Sweat until soft, add the tomatoes and the bouquet garni, bring to a boil, season and simmer for 30 minutes. Serve with the polenta, nut bake or pancakes. Variations Proven\u00e7al vegetable sauce Cook as above, except sweat some chopped courgette, aubergine and red pepper with the other vegetables, and deglaze the pan with a little wine vinegar before adding the tomatoes. Before serving, add basil and black olives. Spicy tomato sauce Cook as above, except add some fresh, finely chopped chilli and ginger to the vegetables, and deglaze the pan with wine vinegar before continuing \u0095 Do you have a culinary dilemma?

The only trouble was that, by the time they got to the riverbank, we had eaten all the lunch. I forget now whether this was because it was so delicious or because RB's sense of riverbank portion control verged on the monastic.

There's nothing wrong with that, so long as the food justifies the ambition.</p> <p>The chef in charge of the kitchen is Rupert Rowley, a graduate of L'Ortolan and the John Burton-Race school of culinary excellence, and his menu is an interesting compilation. There's a bit of Italy, with a risotto of wild mushrooms and a tomato-and-mozzarella tart with balsamic vinegar dressing, and even a bit of Asia, what with a selection of fresh fish and mussels simmered in a Thai-style broth, but for the most part the dishes are irredeemably French, which, after a couple of weeks of Eurofusion food is a bit of a relief.</p> <p>So it was a saucisse de morteau with warm new potato and parsley salad, followed by grilled wood pigeon breast on a fondant potato with chive sauce for me; and, for Marjoribanks, ham and foie gras terrine with piccalilli and toast, followed by oxtail braised in red wine and stuffed with mushroom mousse, with mash and roast root veg. It was something of a masculine affair, I'll grant you, but Rowley has his lighter side, too. We just chose to ignore it. Anyway, on paper, this looked like a pretty decent line of hale and hearty cuisine bourgeoise.</p> <p>So it was, in a way. The food - all of it - was exceptionally well-cooked. The potato salad resisted gently to the tooth, and the sausage was a delicate, high-born thing. The dressing had been lightened with chicken stock to make it well-rounded and mild-mannered. The pigeon had body and texture, without being tough and indigestible. There were lots of unadvertised carrot slices, sweet and glistening with butter, and the chive sauce was emulsified to a refreshing lightness.</p> <p>Marjoribanks complained that his terrine didn't have enough foie gras in it (at \u00a37 for a healthy slab, what did he expect?), but he had nothing but praise for the succulence of the ham or the sharpness of the piccalilli. And his oxtail very nearly brought him to a complete standstill. It was a thing like Ayers Rock, the oxtail circling a fine mousse, with loads of wine-dark gravy and cup-winning mash.</p> <p>All this was fine, confident cooking. My only caveat is that, while you can take the chef out of a fine-dining, Michelin-starred restaurant and land him in a rural retreat, it is much more difficult to take the fine-dining, Michelin manner out of the chef. To stack a salad of sausage and potatoes to resemble a rickety lighthouse is to lose the happy, rustic origins of the dish. The pigeon, too, went for architectural height that it didn't need, while the piccalilli stretched out around the circumference of the plate to form a kind of gaily-coloured necklace.

      "body": "<p>Everybody loves buttercups - except farmers. Forget about them for the moment. Buttercups come in a great surge of the most brilliant yellow, from late March on. Where drainage is poor and the ground heavy, there'll seem to be nothing but buttercups on poor farmland. As a child, I loved to walk - better still, to shuffle -through them, getting my shoes covered with their pollen, which is as bright as the flower, though the flower itself is beautifully lacquered with a high-polish, light-reflecting gloss. So, if you hold a buttercup to your skin, the light it sheds will make your skin a glorious shade of yellow.</p> <p>Buttercups, like the whole ranunculus family to which they belong, are poisonous. Cattle and sheep avoid them, but they form an unwelcome component of hay. You are supposed to be a bad farmer if you own fields of buttercups, but these become increasingly rare where the plough is repeatedly making its rounds and disturbing the ground.</p> <p>There are four principal species in my garden, and I didn't have to invite them. First on the scene is goldilocks, Ranunculus auricomus , which I shall expect to see any moment now. It has markedly cupped, quite small but richly-coloured flowers and makes colonies, mixing happily with mauve lady's smock, Cardamine pratensis and wood anemones, Anemone nemorosa .</p> <p>Next, mid-April, R. bulbosus , which you can easily recognise because its green sepals, instead of lying in the same plane as the petals, are turned back and clasp the stem. It will be out with the first carmine flower heads of red clover, and they make an exciting contrast in a setting of young spring grass.</p> <p>Then, R. acris , which is probably the most versatile of the buttercups. Fairly tall, at 0.6m, it has a widely branching habit, flowering May-June. This has a neat, double-flowered form, 'Flore Pleno'. The pale citrinus makes a change from the usual, somewhat penetrating buttercup yellow. 'Stevenii' (1.5m) is quite a giant, semi-double and showy. It is not hard to control as a border perennial, and in its season can be effectively contrasted with a blood-red oriental poppy such as Papaver orientale 'Goliath', (which is not the same as 'Beauty Of Livermere').</p> <p>Last, a tiresome weed, the creeping buttercup, R. repens , which runs like blazes through your lawns and borders and is especially at home in wet soil. But that has a charming double-flowered variety, pleniflorus , which will make a low ground-covering carpet. If you like \"weeds\" in your lawn and don't mow every week, you could establish it there, first making sure it wouldn't be competing with the single-flowered type-plant.</p> <p>There are other good, hardy buttercups.

      "bodyText": "Everybody loves buttercups - except farmers. Forget about them for the moment. Buttercups come in a great surge of the most brilliant yellow, from late March on. Where drainage is poor and the ground heavy, there'll seem to be nothing but buttercups on poor farmland. As a child, I loved to walk - better still, to shuffle -through them, getting my shoes covered with their pollen, which is as bright as the flower, though the flower itself is beautifully lacquered with a high-polish, light-reflecting gloss. So, if you hold a buttercup to your skin, the light it sheds will make your skin a glorious shade of yellow. Buttercups, like the whole ranunculus family to which they belong, are poisonous. Cattle and sheep avoid them, but they form an unwelcome component of hay. You are supposed to be a bad farmer if you own fields of buttercups, but these become increasingly rare where the plough is repeatedly making its rounds and disturbing the ground. There are four principal species in my garden, and I didn't have to invite them. First on the scene is goldilocks, Ranunculus auricomus , which I shall expect to see any moment now. It has markedly cupped, quite small but richly-coloured flowers and makes colonies, mixing happily with mauve lady's smock, Cardamine pratensis and wood anemones, Anemone nemorosa . Next, mid-April, R. bulbosus , which you can easily recognise because its green sepals, instead of lying in the same plane as the petals, are turned back and clasp the stem. It will be out with the first carmine flower heads of red clover, and they make an exciting contrast in a setting of young spring grass. Then, R. acris , which is probably the most versatile of the buttercups. Fairly tall, at 0.6m, it has a widely branching habit, flowering May-June. This has a neat, double-flowered form, 'Flore Pleno'. The pale citrinus makes a change from the usual, somewhat penetrating buttercup yellow. 'Stevenii' (1.5m) is quite a giant, semi-double and showy. It is not hard to control as a border perennial, and in its season can be effectively contrasted with a blood-red oriental poppy such as Papaver orientale 'Goliath', (which is not the same as 'Beauty Of Livermere'). Last, a tiresome weed, the creeping buttercup, R. repens , which runs like blazes through your lawns and borders and is especially at home in wet soil. But that has a charming double-flowered variety, pleniflorus , which will make a low ground-covering carpet. If you like \"weeds\" in your lawn and don't mow every week, you could establish it there, first making sure it wouldn't be competing with the single-flowered type-plant. There are other good, hardy buttercups. R. constantinopolitanus 'Plenus' flowers in April and makes large, very double rosettes, yellow shading to green at the centre. It needs well-fed border fare and is rather subject to the attentions of vine weevil, but otherwise easy. This is a striking plant. R. gramineus takes us into the lance-leaved kinds of buttercup, glaucous in this case and a good background to 0.3m-high flowers. The roots are tuberous and can be divided.

The great spearwort, R. lingua , usually grown in its largest, showiest form 'Grandiflorus' (1.2m), makes a big splash in fairly shallow water for a long summer season, but its colonial activities will need curtailing fairly frequently if it has a free root run. Quite different, though an out-and-out aquatic, is the water crowfoot, R. aquatilis , which is an underwater oxygenator, with thread-fine foliage, but rises to the surface with floating, rounded leaves, there making, if you have a good strain, a delightful display of white flowers. The popular celandines are all derivatives of R. ficaria , which has the same sort of lacquered yellow flowers as buttercups, but shiny, shovel-shaped leaves. All their flowers arise unbranched from ground level on a lowish plant. It mutates readily and there are ever so many named varieties. The roots are clustered little tubers, easily breaking off, so this species can be a difficult weed to manage under mixed border conditions. Spot treatment with Roundup may be the answer.

R. ficaria flore-pleno has tight, green-centred rosettes, and is a charmer in lawn turf, if you will allow that.

It looks excruciatingly uncomfortable, but turns out to be quite bearable when you're tucked up inside, knees curled under your chin, feeling like a giant bird in an open cage. \"My chairs are not designed to sleep in,\" Brammer concedes. \"If you want comfort, buy a Shackleton's high-backed armchair.\" This swing chair was made during \"dinner breaks\" while he was still working as a welder in a steelworks. \"I nearly got the sack for it, although I was only using scrap metal from the skip.

I should have been in the 'snap cabin' listening to the lads going on about football and how many women they had last night.\"</p> <p>And what did the lads think of his efforts? \"Individually, they were quite interested, but collectively they'd take the piss. Somebody asked me what I was going to do with this chair. When I told them I was going to hang it off a beam at home, they thought I was mad.\"</p> <p>Just over a year ago, he took voluntary redundancy and invested the \u00a32,500, plus a grant from the Prince's Trust, in his own company, Aesthenia. At the age of 30, his destiny is now in his own hands, metaphorically and literally.</p> <p>Being good with his hands was always going to be useful for someone who left school at 16 with a City &amp; Guilds certificate in maths. Nothing else. Not even an O-level in metalwork. \"I didn't like the place, and I couldn't wait to get out.\"</p> <p>Less predictable was the gradual emergence of a creative side to his character. Two factors brought it out. The first was when, at 18, he was badly injured in a car accident and spent three years in hospital. \"I was bored senseless, so I started drawing,\" he recalls, gesturing at some of the mesmerising, geometric shapes on the walls of his attic.</p> <p>\"I also started to question what I was doing with my life.\" Which meant that he was open to the possibility of change when he finally emerged into the real world again and met Tammy at a nightclub. She helped open his eyes to a world he had never even dreamed of. They went to galleries together. They went travelling together.</p> <p>\"Last year, there were five of us in an Escort 1300 and we did nine countries in three weeks,\" he recalls, happily. This summer, they're off to Barcelona, where he intends to feast his eyes on Antonio Gaud\u00ed's stunning cathedral, Sagrada Familia. \"Some people reckoned they saw Gaud\u00ed's influences in my work,\" he says. \"Charles Rennie Mackintosh as well. But at the time I'd never heard of either of them. I have now.\"</p> <p>Certainly, there's something Mackintosh about the elegant, slim, tall chair that graces a corner of the attic, next to the steely tendrils of an even taller candelabra. But it seems unlikely that the great exponent of Art Nouveau would have designed a chair cut from a grid of machine-tool parts. The rusting remains of the grid languish on what Brammer calls his \"mini-scrapheap\", behind his workshop in Rotherham. There with it are other unlikely raw materials, including radiators, exhausts, metal fuseboxes and the sort of gate used to stop toddlers plunging down stairs.</p> <p>This is the second workshop to come his way via the local authority's enterprise scheme. The first burnt down within a week of him moving in, the result of an accident involving a blowtorch and contractors working on the roof. Never one to waste an opportunity, he recycled the molten steel floor and transformed it into a 15-stone dragon's head, which attracted some much-needed publicity on regional television when it was shown at an exhibition in Leeds.</p> <p>An artist, then, as well as a designer? Brammer is not entirely happy with either tag. He's acutely conscious of his lack of a fine-art background and has a fear of sounding pretentious. \"Some people in the art world seem more interested in talking about it than doing it,\" he mutters. \"And some galleries seem more interested in what your name is and where you come from than what you have to offer. Somebody asked me if one of my pieces had a name. I said, 'Yes, it's a chair.' 'Anything else to say about it?' 'No.'\"</p> <p>Lizzie Roberts, of the Atelier 18 Gallery in Nottingham, has long since given up trying to coax an artist's statement out of Brammer. \"But if I put one of his pieces in the window, I know it will attract passers-by,\" she says. \"We're as far from the sea as it's possible to be in this country, but I've just sold one of his chairs for \u00a3400 to a prosperous-looking chap who wanted to put it next to the wheel on his boat.\"</p> <p>An unlikely spot to find a piece of steel with style that might easily have been condemned to a last rusting place in a Sheffield scrapyard</p> <p>\u0095 Aesthenia: 07801 355650.</p>",

The first was when, at 18, he was badly injured in a car accident and spent three years in hospital. \"I was bored senseless, so I started drawing,\" he recalls, gesturing at some of the mesmerising, geometric shapes on the walls of his attic. \"I also started to question what I was doing with my life.\" Which meant that he was open to the possibility of change when he finally emerged into the real world again and met Tammy at a nightclub. She helped open his eyes to a world he had never even dreamed of. They went to galleries together. They went travelling together. \"Last year, there were five of us in an Escort 1300 and we did nine countries in three weeks,\" he recalls, happily. This summer, they're off to Barcelona, where he intends to feast his eyes on Antonio Gaud\u00ed's stunning cathedral, Sagrada Familia. \"Some people reckoned they saw Gaud\u00ed's influences in my work,\" he says. \"Charles Rennie Mackintosh as well. But at the time I'd never heard of either of them. I have now.\" Certainly, there's something Mackintosh about the elegant, slim, tall chair that graces a corner of the attic, next to the steely tendrils of an even taller candelabra. But it seems unlikely that the great exponent of Art Nouveau would have designed a chair cut from a grid of machine-tool parts. The rusting remains of the grid languish on what Brammer calls his \"mini-scrapheap\", behind his workshop in Rotherham. There with it are other unlikely raw materials, including radiators, exhausts, metal fuseboxes and the sort of gate used to stop toddlers plunging down stairs. This is the second workshop to come his way via the local authority's enterprise scheme. The first burnt down within a week of him moving in, the result of an accident involving a blowtorch and contractors working on the roof. Never one to waste an opportunity, he recycled the molten steel floor and transformed it into a 15-stone dragon's head, which attracted some much-needed publicity on regional television when it was shown at an exhibition in Leeds. An artist, then, as well as a designer? Brammer is not entirely happy with either tag. He's acutely conscious of his lack of a fine-art background and has a fear of sounding pretentious. \"Some people in the art world seem more interested in talking about it than doing it,\" he mutters. \"And some galleries seem more interested in what your name is and where you come from than what you have to offer. Somebody asked me if one of my pieces had a name. I said, 'Yes, it's a chair.' 'Anything else to say about it?' 'No.'\" Lizzie Roberts, of the Atelier 18 Gallery in Nottingham, has long since given up trying to coax an artist's statement out of Brammer. \"But if I put one of his pieces in the window, I know it will attract passers-by,\" she says. \"We're as far from the sea as it's possible to be in this country, but I've just sold one of his chairs for \u00a3400 to a prosperous-looking chap who wanted to put it next to the wheel on his boat.\" An unlikely spot to find a piece of steel with style that might easily have been condemned to a last rusting place in a Sheffield scrapyard \u0095 Aesthenia: 07801 355650.",

      "body": "<p>Wherever you go in Iraq's southern city of Basra, there is dust. It gets in your eyes and nose and throat. It swirls in school playgrounds and consumes children kicking a plastic ball. \"It carries death,\" said Dr Jawad Al-Ali, a cancer specialist and member of Britain's Royal College of Physicians. \"Our own studies indicate that more than 40 per cent of the population in this area will get cancer: in five years' time to begin with, then long afterwards. Most of my own family now have cancer, and we have no history of the disease. It has spread to the medical staff of this hospital. We don't know the precise source of the contamination, because we are not allowed to get the equipment to conduct a proper scientific survey, or even to test the excess level of radiation in our bodies. We suspect depleted uranium, which was used by the Americans and British in the Gulf War right across the southern battlefields.\"</p> <p>Under economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council almost 10 years ago, Iraq is denied equipment and expertise to clean up its contaminated battle-fields, as Kuwait was cleaned up. At the same time, the Sanctions Committee in New York, dominated by the Americans and British, has blocked or delayed a range of vital equipment, chemotherapy drugs and even pain-killers. \"For us doctors,\" said Dr Al-Ali, \"it is like torture. We see children die from the kind of cancers from which, given the right treatment, there is a good recovery rate.\" Three children died while I was there.</p> <p>Six other children died not far away on January 25, last year. An American missile hit Al Jumohria, a street in a poor residential area. Sixty-three people were injured, a number of them badly burned. \"Collateral damage,\" said the Department of Defence in Washington. Britain and the United States are still bombing Iraq almost every day: it is the longest Anglo-American bombing campaign since the second world war, yet, with honourable exceptions, very little appears about it in the British media. Conducted under the cover of \"no fly zones\", which have no basis in international law, the aircraft, according to Tony Blair, are \"performing vital humanitarian tasks\". The ministry of defence in London has a line about \"taking robust action to protect pilots\" from Iraqi attacks - yet an internal UN Security Sector report says that, in one five-month period, 41 per cent of the victims were civilians in civilian targets: villages, fishing jetties, farmland and vast, treeless valleys where sheep graze. A shepherd, his father, his four children and his sheep were killed by a British or American aircraft, which made two passes at them. I stood in the cemetery where the children are buried and their mother shouted, \"I want to speak to the pilot who did this.\"</p> <p>This is a war against the children of Iraq on two fronts: bombing, which in the last year cost the British taxpayer \u00a360 million. And the most ruthless embargo in modern history. According to Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, the death rate of children under five is more than 4,000 a month - that is 4,000 more than would have died before sanctions. That is half a million children dead in eight years. If this statistic is difficult to grasp, consider, on the day you read this, up to 200 Iraqi children may die needlessly. \"Even if not all the suffering in Iraq can be imputed to external factors,\" says Unicef, \"the Iraqi people would not be undergoing such deprivation in the absence of the prolonged measures imposed by the Security Council and the effects of war.\"</p> <p>Through the glass doors of the Unicef offices in Baghdad, you can read the following mission statement: \"Above all, survival, hope, development, respect, dignity, equality and justice for women and children.\" A black sense of irony will be useful if you are a young Iraqi. As it is, the children hawking in the street outside, with their pencil limbs and eyes too big for their long thin faces, cannot read English, and perhaps cannot read at all.</p> <p>\"The change in 10 years is unparalleled, in my experience,\" Anupama Rao Singh, Unicef's senior representative in Iraq, told me. \"In 1989, the literacy rate was 95%; and 93% of the population had free access to modern health facilities. Parents were fined for failing to send their children to school. The phenomenon of street children or children begging was unheard of. Iraq had reached a stage where the basic indicators we use to measure the overall well-being of human beings, including children, were some of the best in the world. Now it is among the bottom 20%. In 10 years, child mortality has gone from one of the lowest in the world, to the highest.\"</p> <p>Anupama Rao Singh, originally a teacher in India, has spent most of her working life with Unicef. Helping children is her vocation, but now, in charge of a humanitarian programme that can never succeed, she says, \"I am grieving.\" She took me to a typical primary school in Saddam City, where Baghdad's poorest live. We approached along a flooded street: the city's drainage and water distribution system have collapsed. The head, Ali Hassoon, wore the melancholia that marks Iraqi teachers and doctors and other carers: those who know they can do little \"until you, in the outside world, decide\". Guiding us around the puddles of raw sewage in the playground, he pointed to the high water mark on a wall. \"In the winter it comes up to here. That's when we evacuate. We stay as long as possible, but without desks, the children have to sit on bricks. I am worried about the buildings coming down.\"</p> <p>The school is on the edge of a vast industrial cemetery. The pumps in the sewage treatment plants and the reservoirs of water are silent, save for a few wheezing at a fraction of their capacity. Many were targets in the American-led blitz in January 1991; most have since disintegrated without spare parts from their British, French and German builders. These are mostly delayed by the Security Council's Sanctions Committee; the term used is \"placed on hold\". Ten years ago, 92% of the population had safe water, according to Unicef. Today, drawn untreated from the Tigris, it is lethal. Touching two brothers on the head, the head said, \"These children are recovering from dysentery, but it will attack them again, and again, until they are too weak.\" Chlorine, that universal guardian of safe water, has been blocked by the Sanctions Committee. In 1990, an Iraqi infant with dysentery stood a one in 600 chance of dying. This is now one in 50.</p> <p>Just before Christmas, the department of trade and industry in London blocked a shipment of vaccines meant to protect Iraqi children against diphtheria and yellow fever. Dr Kim Howells told parliament why. His title of under secretary of state for competition and consumer affairs, eminently suited his Orwellian reply. The children's vaccines were banned, he said, \"because they are capable of being used in weapons of mass destruction\". That his finger was on the trigger of a proven weapon of mass destruction - sanctions - seemed not to occur to him. A courtly, eloquent Irishman, Denis Halliday resigned as co-ordinator of humanitarian relief to Iraq in 1998, after 34 years with the UN; he was then Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations, one of the elite of senior officials. He had made his career in development, \"attempting to help people, not harm them\". His was the first public expression of an unprecedented rebellion within the UN bureaucracy. \"I am resigning,\" he wrote, \"because the policy of economic sanctions is totally bankrupt. We are in the process of destroying an entire society. It is as simple and terrifying as that . . . Five thousand children are dying every month . . . I don't want to administer a programme that results in figures like these.\"</p> <p>When I first met Halliday, I was struck by the care with which he chose uncompromising words. \"I had been instructed,\" he said, \"to implement a policy that satisfies the definition of genocide: a deliberate policy that has effectively killed well over a million individuals, children and adults. We all know that the regime, Saddam Hussein, is not paying the price for economic sanctions; on the contrary, he has been strengthened by them. It is the little people who are losing their children or their parents for lack of untreated water. What is clear is that the Security Council is now out of control, for its actions here undermine its own Charter, and the Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Convention. History will slaughter those responsible.\"</p> <p>Inside the UN, Halliday broke a long collective silence. Then on February 13 this year, Hans von Sponeck, who had succeeded him as humanitarian co-ordinator in Iraq, resigned. \"How long,\" he asked, \"should the civilian population of Iraq be exposed to such punishment for something they have never done?\" Two days later, Jutta Burghardt, head of the World Food Programme in Iraq, resigned, saying privately she, too, could not tolerate what was being done to the Iraqi people. Another resignation is expected.</p> <p>When I met von Sponeck in Baghdad last October, the anger building behind his measured, self-effacing exterior was evident. Like Halliday before him, his job was to administer the Oil for Food Programme, which since 1996 has allowed Iraq to sell a fraction of its oil for money that goes straight to the Security Council. Almost a third pays the UN's \"expenses\", reparations to Kuwait and compensation claims. Iraq then tenders on the international market for food and medical supplies and other humanitarian supplies. Every contract must be approved by the Sanctions Committee in New York. \"What it comes down to,\" he said, \"is that we can spend only $180 per person over six months. It is a pitiful picture. Whatever the arguments about Iraq, they should not be conducted on the backs of the civilian population.\"</p> <p>Denis Halliday and I travelled to Iraq together. It was his first trip back. Washington and London make much of the influence of Iraqi propaganda when their own, unchallenged, is by far the most potent. With this in mind, I wanted an independent assessment from some of the 550 UN people, who are Iraq's lifeline. Among them, Halliday and von Sponeck are heroes. I have reported the UN at work in many countries; I have never known such dissent and anger, directed at the manipulation of the Security Council, and the corruption of what some of them still refer to as the UN \"ideal\".</p> <p>Our journey from Amman in Jordan took 16 anxious hours on the road. This is the only authorised way in and out of Iraq: a ribbon of wrecked cars and burnt-out oil tankers. Baghdad was just visible beneath a white pall of pollution, largely the consequence of the US Air Force strategy of targeting the industrial infrastructure in January 1991. Young arms reached up to the window of our van: a boy offering an over-ripe banana, a girl a single stem flower. Before 1990, such a scene was rare and frowned upon.</p> <p>Baghdad is an urban version of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring. The birds have gone as avenues of palms have died, and this was the land of dates. The splashes of colour, on fruit stalls, are surreal. A bunch of Dole bananas and a bag of apples from Beirut cost a teacher's salary for a month; only foreigners and the rich eat fruit. A currency that once was worth two dollars to the dinar is now worthless. The rich, the black marketeers, the regime's cronies and favourites, are not visible, except for an occasional tinted-glass late-model Mercedes navigating its way through the rustbuckets. Having been ordered to keep their heads down, they keep to their network of clubs and restaurants and well-stocked clinics, which make nonsense of the propaganda that the sanctions are hurting them, not ordinary Iraqis.</p> <p>In the centre of Baghdad is a monument to the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, which Saddam Hussein started, with encouragement from the Americans, who wanted him to destroy their great foe, the Ayatollah Khomeini. When it was over, at least a million lives had been lost in the cause of nothing, fuelled by the arms industries of Britain and the rest of Europe, the Soviet Union and the United States: the principal members of the Security Council. The monument's two huge forearms, modelled on Saddam's arms (and cast in Basingstoke), hold triumphant crossed sabres. Cars are allowed to drive over the helmets of dead Iranian soldiers embedded in the concourse. I cannot think of a sight anywhere in the world that better expresses the crime of sacrificial war.</p> <p>We stayed at the Hotel Palestine, once claiming five stars. The smell of petrol was constant. As disinfectant is often \"on hold\", petrol, more plentiful than water, has replaced it. There is an Iraqi Airways office, which is open every day, with an employee sitting behind a desk, smiling and saying good morning to passing guests. She has no clients, because there is no Iraqi Airways - it died with sanctions. The pilots drive taxis and sweep the forecourt and sell used clothes. In my room, the water ran gravy brown. The one frayed towel was borne by the maid like an heirloom. When I asked for coffee to be brought up, the waiter hovered outside until I was finished; cups are at a premium. His young face was streaked with sadness. \"I am always sad,\" he agreed matter-of-factly. In a month, he will have earned enough to buy tablets for his brother's epilepsy.</p> <p>The same sadness is on the faces of people in the evening auctions, where intimate possessions are sold for food and medicines. Television sets are the most common items; a woman with two toddlers watched their pushchairs go for pennies. A man who had collected doves since he was 15 came with his last bird; the cage would go next. Although we had come to pry, my film crew and I were made welcome. Only once, was I the brunt of the hurt that is almost tangible in a society more westernised than any other Arab country. \"Why are you killing the children?\" shouted a man from behind his bookstall. \"Why are you bombing us? What have we done to you?\" Passers-by moved quickly to calm him; one man placed an affectionate arm on his shoulder, another, a teacher, materialised at my side. \"We do not connect the people of Britain with the actions of the government,\" he said. Laith Kubba, a leading member of the exiled Iraqi opposition, later told me in Washington, \"The Iraqi people and Saddam Hussein are not the same, which is why those of us who have dedicated our lives to fighting him, regard the sanctions as immoral.\"</p> <p>In an Edwardian colonnade of Doric and Corinthian columns, people come to sell their books, not as in a flea market, but out of desperate need. Art books, leather bound in Baghdad in the 30s, obstetrics and radiology texts, copies of British Medical Journals, first and second editions of Waiting For Godot, The Sun Also Rises and, no less, British Housing Policy 1958 were on sale for the price of a few cigarettes. A man in a clipped grey moustache, an Iraqi Bertie Wooster, said, \"I need to go south to see my sister, who is ill. Please be kind and give me 25 dinars.\" (About a penny). He took it, nodded and walked smartly away.</p> <p>Mohamed Ghani's studio is dominated by a huge crucifix he is sculpting for the Church of Assumption in Baghdad. As Iraq's most famous sculptor, he is proud that the Vatican has commissioned him, a Muslim, to sculpt the Stations of the Cross in Rome - a romantic metaphor of his country as Mesopotamia, the \"cradle of Western civilisation\". His latest work is a 20-foot figure of a woman, her child gripping her legs, pleading for food. \"Every morning, I see her,\" he said, \"waiting, with others just like her, in a long line at the hospital at the end of my road. They are what we have been forced to become.\" He has produced a line of figurines that depict their waiting; all the heads are bowed before a door that is permanently closed. \"The door is the dispensary,\" he said, \"but it is also the world, kept shut by those who run the world.\" The next day, I saw a similar line of women and children, and fathers and children, in the cancer ward at the Al Mansour children's hospital. It is not unlike St Thomas's in London. Drugs arrived, they said, but intermittently, so that children with leukaemia, who can be saved with a full course of three anti-biotics, pass a point beyond which they cannot be saved, because one is missing. Children with meningitis can also survive with the precise dosage of antibiotics; here they die. \"Four milligrams save a life,\" said Dr Mohamed Mahmud, \"but so often we are allowed no more than one milligram.\" This is a teaching hospital, yet children die because there are no blood-collecting bags and no machines that separate blood platelets: basic equipment in any British hospital. Replacements and spare parts have been \"on hold\" in New York, together with incubators, X-ray machines, and heart and lung machines.</p> <p>I sat in a clinic as doctors received parents and their children, some of them dying. After every other examination, Dr Lekaa Fasseh Ozeer, the oncologist, wrote in English: \"No drugs available.\" I asked her to jot down in my notebook a list of the drugs the hospital had ordered, but rarely saw. In London, I showed this to Professor Karol Sikora who, as chief of the cancer programme of the World Health Organisation (WHO), wrote in the British Medical Journal last year: \"Requested radiotherapy equipment, chemotherapy drugs and analgesics are consistently blocked by United States and British advisers [to the Sanctions Committee in New York]. There seems to be a rather ludicrous notion that such agents could be converted into chemical or other weapons.\"</p> <p>He told me, \"Nearly all these drugs are available in every British hospital. They're very standard. When I came back from Iraq last year, with a group of experts I drew up a list of 17 drugs that are deemed essential for cancer treatment. We informed the UN that there was no possibility of converting these drugs into chemical warfare agents. We heard nothing more. The saddest thing I saw in Iraq was children dying because there was no chemotherapy and no pain control. It seemed crazy they couldn't have morphine, because for everybody with cancer pain, it is the best drug. When I was there, they had a little bottle of aspirin pills to go round 200 patients in pain. They would receive a particular anti-cancer drug, but then get only little bits of drugs here and there, and so you can't have any planning. It is bizarre.\"</p> <p>In January, last year, George Robertson, then defence secretary, said, \"Saddam Hussein has in warehouses $275 million worth of medicines and medical supplies which he refuses to distribute.\" The British government knew this was false, because UN humanitarian officials had made clear the problem of drugs and equipment coming sporadically into Iraq - such as machines without a crucial part, IV fluids and syringes arriving separately - as well as the difficulties of transport and the need for a substantial buffer stock. \"The goods that come into this country are distributed to where they belong,\" said Hans von Sponeck. \"Our most recent stock analysis shows that 88.8% of all humanitarian supplies have been distributed.\" The representatives of Unicef, the World Food Programme and the Food and Agricultural Organisation confirmed this. If Saddam Hussein believed he could draw an advantage from obstructing humanitarian aid, he would no doubt do so. However, according to a FAO study: \"The government of Iraq introduced a public food rationing system with effect from within a month of the imposition of the embargo. It provides basic foods at 1990 prices, which means they are now virtually free. This has a life-saving nutritional benefit . . . and has prevented catastrophe for the Iraqi people.\"</p> <p>The rebellion in the UN reaches up to Kofi Annan, once thought to be the most compliant of secretary-generals. Appointed after Madeleine Albright, then the US representative at the UN, had waged a campaign to get rid of his predecessor, Boutros-Boutros Ghali, he pointedly renewed Hans von Sponeck's contract in the face of a similar campaign by the Americans. He shocked them last October when he accused the US of \"using its muscle on the Sanctions Committee to put indefinite 'holds' on more than $700 million worth of humanitarian goods that Iraq would like to buy.\" When I met Kofi Annan, I asked if sanctions had all but destroyed the credibility of the UN as a benign body. \"Please don't judge us by Iraq,\" he said.</p> <p>On January 7, the UN's Office of Iraq Programme reported that shipments valued at almost a billion and a half dollars were \"on hold\". They covered food, health, water and sanitation, agriculture, education. On February 7, its executive director attacked the Security Council for holding up spares for Iraq's crumbling oil industry. \"We would appeal to all members of the Security Council,\" he wrote, \"to reflect on the argument that unless key items of oil industry are made available within a short time, the production of oil will drop . . . This is a clear warning.\" In other words, the less oil Iraq is allowed to pump, the less money will be available to buy food and medicine. According to the Iraqis at the UN, it was US representative on the Sanctions Committee who vetoed shipments the Security Council had authorised. Last year, a senior US official told the Washington Post, \"The longer we can fool around in the [Security] Council and keep things static, the better.\" There is a pettiness in sanctions that borders on vindictiveness. In Britain, Customs and Excise stops parcels going to relatives, containing children's clothes and toys. Last year, the chairman of the British Library, John Ashworth, wrote to Harry Cohen MP that, \"after consultation with the foreign office\", it was decided that books could no longer be sent to Iraqi students.</p> <p>In Washington, I interviewed James Rubin, an under secretary of state who speaks for Madeleine Albright. When asked on US television if she thought that the death of half a million Iraqi children was a price worth paying, Albright replied: \"This is a very hard choice, but we think the price is worth it.\" When I questioned Rubin about this, he claimed Albright's words were taken out of context. He then questioned the \"methodology\" of a report by the UN's World Health Organisation, which had estimated half a million deaths. Advising me against being \"too idealistic\", he said: \"In making policy, one has to choose between two bad choices . . . and unfortunately the effect of sanctions has been more than we would have hoped.\" He referred me to the \"real world\" where \"real choices have to be made\". In mitigation, he said, \"Our sense is that prior to sanctions, there was serious poverty and health problems in Iraq.\" The opposite was true, as Unicef's data on Iraq before 1990, makes clear.</p> <p>The irony is that the US helped bring Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party to power in Iraq, and that the US (and Britain) in the 1980s conspired to break their own laws in order, in the words of a Congressional inquiry, to \"secretly court Saddam Hussein with reckless abandon\", giving him almost everything he wanted, including the means of making biological weapons. Rubin failed to see the irony in the US supplying Saddam with seed stock for anthrax and botulism, that he could use in weapons, and claimed that the Maryland company responsible was prosecuted. It was not: the company was given Commerce Department approval.</p> <p>Denial is easy, for Iraqis are a nation of unpeople in the West, their panoramic suffering of minimal media interest; and when they are news, care is always taken to minimise Western culpability. I can think of no other human rights issue about which the governments have been allowed to sustain such deception and tell so many bare-faced lies. Western governments have had a gift in the \"butcher of Baghdad\", who can be safely blamed for everything. Unlike the be-headers of Saudi Arabia, the torturers of Turkey and the prince of mass murderers, Suharto, only Saddam Hussein is so loathsome that his captive population can be punished for his crimes. British obsequiousness to Washington's designs over Iraq has a certain craven quality, as the Blair government pursues what Simon Jenkins calls a \"low-cost, low-risk machismo, doing something relatively easy, but obscenely cruel\". The statements of Tony Blair and Robin Cook and assorted sidekick ministers would, in other circumstances, be laughable. Cook: \"We must nail the absurd claim that sanctions are responsible for the suffering of the Iraqi people\", Cook: \"We must uphold the sanctity of international law and the United Nations . . .\" ad nauseam. The British boast about their \"initiative\" in promoting the latest Security Council resolution, which merely offers the prospect of more Kafkaesque semantics and prevarication in the guise of a \"solution\" and changes nothing.</p> <p>What are sanctions for? Eradicating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, says the Security Council resolution. Scott Ritter, a chief UN weapons inspector in Iraq for five years, told me: \"By 1998, the chemical weapons infrastructure had been completely dismantled or destroyed by UNSCOM (the UN inspections body) or by Iraq in compliance with our mandate. The biological weapons programme was gone, all the major facilities eliminated. The nuclear weapons programme was completely eliminated. The long range ballistic missile programme was completely eliminated. If I had to quantify Iraq's threat, I would say [it is] zero.\" Ritter resigned in protest at US interference; he and his American colleagues were expelled when American spy equipment was found by the Iraqis. To counter the risk of Iraq reconstituting its arsenal, he says the weapons inspectors should go back to Iraq after the immediate lifting of all non-military sanctions; the inspectors of the international Atomic Energy Agency are already back. At the very least, the two issues of sanctions and weapons inspection should be entirely separate. Madeleine Albright has said: \"We do not agree that if Iraq complies with its obligations concerning weapons of mass destruction, sanctions should be lifted.\" If this means that Saddam Hussein is the target, then the embargo will go on indefinitely, holding Iraqis hostage to their tyrant's compliance with his own demise. Or is there another agenda? In January 1991, the Americans had an opportunity to press on to Baghdad and remove Saddam, but pointedly stopped short. A few weeks later, they not only failed to support the Kurdish and Shi'a uprising, which President Bush had called for, but even prevented the rebelling troops in the south from reaching captured arms depots and allowed Saddam Hussein's helicopters to slaughter them while US aircraft circled overhead. At they same time, Washington refused to support Iraqi opposition groups and Kurdish claims for independence.</p> <p>\"Containing\" Iraq with sanctions destroys Iraq's capacity to threaten US control of the Middle East's oil while allowing Saddam to maintain internal order. As long as he stays within present limits, he is allowed to rule over a crippled nation. \"What the West would ideally like,\" says Said Aburish, the author, \"is another Saddam Hussein.\" Sanctions also justify the huge US military presence in the Gulf, as Nato expands east, viewing a vast new oil protectorate stretching from Turkey to the Caucasus. Bombing and sanctions are ideal for policing this new order: a strategy the president of the American Physicians for Human Rights calls \"Bomb Now, Die Later\". The perpetrators ought not be allowed to get away with this in our name: for the sake of the children of Iraq, and all the Iraqs to come</p> <p>\u00a9 John Pilger</p> <p>Paying the Price: Killing The Children Of Iraq, a documentary by John Pilger and Alan Lowery, will be on ITV this Monday at 9.30pm.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wherever you go in Iraq's southern city of Basra, there is dust. It gets in your eyes and nose and throat. It swirls in school playgrounds and consumes children kicking a plastic ball. \"It carries death,\" said Dr Jawad Al-Ali, a cancer specialist and member of Britain's Royal College of Physicians. \"Our own studies indicate that more than 40 per cent of the population in this area will get cancer: in five years' time to begin with, then long afterwards. Most of my own family now have cancer, and we have no history of the disease. It has spread to the medical staff of this hospital. We don't know the precise source of the contamination, because we are not allowed to get the equipment to conduct a proper scientific survey, or even to test the excess level of radiation in our bodies. We suspect depleted uranium, which was used by the Americans and British in the Gulf War right across the southern battlefields.\" Under economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council almost 10 years ago, Iraq is denied equipment and expertise to clean up its contaminated battle-fields, as Kuwait was cleaned up. At the same time, the Sanctions Committee in New York, dominated by the Americans and British, has blocked or delayed a range of vital equipment, chemotherapy drugs and even pain-killers. \"For us doctors,\" said Dr Al-Ali, \"it is like torture. We see children die from the kind of cancers from which, given the right treatment, there is a good recovery rate.\" Three children died while I was there. Six other children died not far away on January 25, last year. An American missile hit Al Jumohria, a street in a poor residential area. Sixty-three people were injured, a number of them badly burned. \"Collateral damage,\" said the Department of Defence in Washington. Britain and the United States are still bombing Iraq almost every day: it is the longest Anglo-American bombing campaign since the second world war, yet, with honourable exceptions, very little appears about it in the British media. Conducted under the cover of \"no fly zones\", which have no basis in international law, the aircraft, according to Tony Blair, are \"performing vital humanitarian tasks\". The ministry of defence in London has a line about \"taking robust action to protect pilots\" from Iraqi attacks - yet an internal UN Security Sector report says that, in one five-month period, 41 per cent of the victims were civilians in civilian targets: villages, fishing jetties, farmland and vast, treeless valleys where sheep graze. A shepherd, his father, his four children and his sheep were killed by a British or American aircraft, which made two passes at them. I stood in the cemetery where the children are buried and their mother shouted, \"I want to speak to the pilot who did this.\" This is a war against the children of Iraq on two fronts: bombing, which in the last year cost the British taxpayer \u00a360 million. And the most ruthless embargo in modern history. According to Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, the death rate of children under five is more than 4,000 a month - that is 4,000 more than would have died before sanctions. That is half a million children dead in eight years. If this statistic is difficult to grasp, consider, on the day you read this, up to 200 Iraqi children may die needlessly. \"Even if not all the suffering in Iraq can be imputed to external factors,\" says Unicef, \"the Iraqi people would not be undergoing such deprivation in the absence of the prolonged measures imposed by the Security Council and the effects of war.\" Through the glass doors of the Unicef offices in Baghdad, you can read the following mission statement: \"Above all, survival, hope, development, respect, dignity, equality and justice for women and children.\" A black sense of irony will be useful if you are a young Iraqi. As it is, the children hawking in the street outside, with their pencil limbs and eyes too big for their long thin faces, cannot read English, and perhaps cannot read at all. \"The change in 10 years is unparalleled, in my experience,\" Anupama Rao Singh, Unicef's senior representative in Iraq, told me. \"In 1989, the literacy rate was 95%; and 93% of the population had free access to modern health facilities. Parents were fined for failing to send their children to school. The phenomenon of street children or children begging was unheard of. Iraq had reached a stage where the basic indicators we use to measure the overall well-being of human beings, including children, were some of the best in the world. Now it is among the bottom 20%. In 10 years, child mortality has gone from one of the lowest in the world, to the highest.\" Anupama Rao Singh, originally a teacher in India, has spent most of her working life with Unicef. Helping children is her vocation, but now, in charge of a humanitarian programme that can never succeed, she says, \"I am grieving.\" She took me to a typical primary school in Saddam City, where Baghdad's poorest live. We approached along a flooded street: the city's drainage and water distribution system have collapsed. The head, Ali Hassoon, wore the melancholia that marks Iraqi teachers and doctors and other carers: those who know they can do little \"until you, in the outside world, decide\". Guiding us around the puddles of raw sewage in the playground, he pointed to the high water mark on a wall. \"In the winter it comes up to here. That's when we evacuate. We stay as long as possible, but without desks, the children have to sit on bricks. I am worried about the buildings coming down.\" The school is on the edge of a vast industrial cemetery. The pumps in the sewage treatment plants and the reservoirs of water are silent, save for a few wheezing at a fraction of their capacity. Many were targets in the American-led blitz in January 1991; most have since disintegrated without spare parts from their British, French and German builders. These are mostly delayed by the Security Council's Sanctions Committee; the term used is \"placed on hold\". Ten years ago, 92% of the population had safe water, according to Unicef. Today, drawn untreated from the Tigris, it is lethal. Touching two brothers on the head, the head said, \"These children are recovering from dysentery, but it will attack them again, and again, until they are too weak.\" Chlorine, that universal guardian of safe water, has been blocked by the Sanctions Committee. In 1990, an Iraqi infant with dysentery stood a one in 600 chance of dying. This is now one in 50. Just before Christmas, the department of trade and industry in London blocked a shipment of vaccines meant to protect Iraqi children against diphtheria and yellow fever. Dr Kim Howells told parliament why. His title of under secretary of state for competition and consumer affairs, eminently suited his Orwellian reply. The children's vaccines were banned, he said, \"because they are capable of being used in weapons of mass destruction\". That his finger was on the trigger of a proven weapon of mass destruction - sanctions - seemed not to occur to him. A courtly, eloquent Irishman, Denis Halliday resigned as co-ordinator of humanitarian relief to Iraq in 1998, after 34 years with the UN; he was then Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations, one of the elite of senior officials. He had made his career in development, \"attempting to help people, not harm them\". His was the first public expression of an unprecedented rebellion within the UN bureaucracy. \"I am resigning,\" he wrote, \"because the policy of economic sanctions is totally bankrupt. We are in the process of destroying an entire society. It is as simple and terrifying as that . . . Five thousand children are dying every month . . . I don't want to administer a programme that results in figures like these.\" When I first met Halliday, I was struck by the care with which he chose uncompromising words. \"I had been instructed,\" he said, \"to implement a policy that satisfies the definition of genocide: a deliberate policy that has effectively killed well over a million individuals, children and adults. We all know that the regime, Saddam Hussein, is not paying the price for economic sanctions; on the contrary, he has been strengthened by them. It is the little people who are losing their children or their parents for lack of untreated water. What is clear is that the Security Council is now out of control, for its actions here undermine its own Charter, and the Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Convention. History will slaughter those responsible.\" Inside the UN, Halliday broke a long collective silence. Then on February 13 this year, Hans von Sponeck, who had succeeded him as humanitarian co-ordinator in Iraq, resigned. \"How long,\" he asked, \"should the civilian population of Iraq be exposed to such punishment for something they have never done?\" Two days later, Jutta Burghardt, head of the World Food Programme in Iraq, resigned, saying privately she, too, could not tolerate what was being done to the Iraqi people. Another resignation is expected. When I met von Sponeck in Baghdad last October, the anger building behind his measured, self-effacing exterior was evident. Like Halliday before him, his job was to administer the Oil for Food Programme, which since 1996 has allowed Iraq to sell a fraction of its oil for money that goes straight to the Security Council. Almost a third pays the UN's \"expenses\", reparations to Kuwait and compensation claims. Iraq then tenders on the international market for food and medical supplies and other humanitarian supplies. Every contract must be approved by the Sanctions Committee in New York. \"What it comes down to,\" he said, \"is that we can spend only $180 per person over six months. It is a pitiful picture. Whatever the arguments about Iraq, they should not be conducted on the backs of the civilian population.\" Denis Halliday and I travelled to Iraq together. It was his first trip back. Washington and London make much of the influence of Iraqi propaganda when their own, unchallenged, is by far the most potent. With this in mind, I wanted an independent assessment from some of the 550 UN people, who are Iraq's lifeline. Among them, Halliday and von Sponeck are heroes. I have reported the UN at work in many countries; I have never known such dissent and anger, directed at the manipulation of the Security Council, and the corruption of what some of them still refer to as the UN \"ideal\". Our journey from Amman in Jordan took 16 anxious hours on the road. This is the only authorised way in and out of Iraq: a ribbon of wrecked cars and burnt-out oil tankers. Baghdad was just visible beneath a white pall of pollution, largely the consequence of the US Air Force strategy of targeting the industrial infrastructure in January 1991. Young arms reached up to the window of our van: a boy offering an over-ripe banana, a girl a single stem flower. Before 1990, such a scene was rare and frowned upon. Baghdad is an urban version of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring. The birds have gone as avenues of palms have died, and this was the land of dates. The splashes of colour, on fruit stalls, are surreal. A bunch of Dole bananas and a bag of apples from Beirut cost a teacher's salary for a month; only foreigners and the rich eat fruit. A currency that once was worth two dollars to the dinar is now worthless. The rich, the black marketeers, the regime's cronies and favourites, are not visible, except for an occasional tinted-glass late-model Mercedes navigating its way through the rustbuckets. Having been ordered to keep their heads down, they keep to their network of clubs and restaurants and well-stocked clinics, which make nonsense of the propaganda that the sanctions are hurting them, not ordinary Iraqis. In the centre of Baghdad is a monument to the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, which Saddam Hussein started, with encouragement from the Americans, who wanted him to destroy their great foe, the Ayatollah Khomeini.

The one frayed towel was borne by the maid like an heirloom. When I asked for coffee to be brought up, the waiter hovered outside until I was finished; cups are at a premium. His young face was streaked with sadness. \"I am always sad,\" he agreed matter-of-factly. In a month, he will have earned enough to buy tablets for his brother's epilepsy. The same sadness is on the faces of people in the evening auctions, where intimate possessions are sold for food and medicines. Television sets are the most common items; a woman with two toddlers watched their pushchairs go for pennies. A man who had collected doves since he was 15 came with his last bird; the cage would go next. Although we had come to pry, my film crew and I were made welcome.

Art books, leather bound in Baghdad in the 30s, obstetrics and radiology texts, copies of British Medical Journals, first and second editions of Waiting For Godot, The Sun Also Rises and, no less, British Housing Policy 1958 were on sale for the price of a few cigarettes. A man in a clipped grey moustache, an Iraqi Bertie Wooster, said, \"I need to go south to see my sister, who is ill. Please be kind and give me 25 dinars.\" (About a penny). He took it, nodded and walked smartly away. Mohamed Ghani's studio is dominated by a huge crucifix he is sculpting for the Church of Assumption in Baghdad. As Iraq's most famous sculptor, he is proud that the Vatican has commissioned him, a Muslim, to sculpt the Stations of the Cross in Rome - a romantic metaphor of his country as Mesopotamia, the \"cradle of Western civilisation\". His latest work is a 20-foot figure of a woman, her child gripping her legs, pleading for food. \"Every morning, I see her,\" he said, \"waiting, with others just like her, in a long line at the hospital at the end of my road. They are what we have been forced to become.\" He has produced a line of figurines that depict their waiting; all the heads are bowed before a door that is permanently closed. \"The door is the dispensary,\" he said, \"but it is also the world, kept shut by those who run the world.\" The next day, I saw a similar line of women and children, and fathers and children, in the cancer ward at the Al Mansour children's hospital. It is not unlike St Thomas's in London. Drugs arrived, they said, but intermittently, so that children with leukaemia, who can be saved with a full course of three anti-biotics, pass a point beyond which they cannot be saved, because one is missing. Children with meningitis can also survive with the precise dosage of antibiotics; here they die. \"Four milligrams save a life,\" said Dr Mohamed Mahmud, \"but so often we are allowed no more than one milligram.\" This is a teaching hospital, yet children die because there are no blood-collecting bags and no machines that separate blood platelets: basic equipment in any British hospital. Replacements and spare parts have been \"on hold\" in New York, together with incubators, X-ray machines, and heart and lung machines. I sat in a clinic as doctors received parents and their children, some of them dying. After every other examination, Dr Lekaa Fasseh Ozeer, the oncologist, wrote in English: \"No drugs available.\" I asked her to jot down in my notebook a list of the drugs the hospital had ordered, but rarely saw. In London, I showed this to Professor Karol Sikora who, as chief of the cancer programme of the World Health Organisation (WHO), wrote in the British Medical Journal last year: \"Requested radiotherapy equipment, chemotherapy drugs and analgesics are consistently blocked by United States and British advisers [to the Sanctions Committee in New York]. There seems to be a rather ludicrous notion that such agents could be converted into chemical or other weapons.\" He told me, \"Nearly all these drugs are available in every British hospital. They're very standard. When I came back from Iraq last year, with a group of experts I drew up a list of 17 drugs that are deemed essential for cancer treatment. We informed the UN that there was no possibility of converting these drugs into chemical warfare agents. We heard nothing more. The saddest thing I saw in Iraq was children dying because there was no chemotherapy and no pain control. It seemed crazy they couldn't have morphine, because for everybody with cancer pain, it is the best drug. When I was there, they had a little bottle of aspirin pills to go round 200 patients in pain. They would receive a particular anti-cancer drug, but then get only little bits of drugs here and there, and so you can't have any planning. It is bizarre.\" In January, last year, George Robertson, then defence secretary, said, \"Saddam Hussein has in warehouses $275 million worth of medicines and medical supplies which he refuses to distribute.\" The British government knew this was false, because UN humanitarian officials had made clear the problem of drugs and equipment coming sporadically into Iraq - such as machines without a crucial part, IV fluids and syringes arriving separately - as well as the difficulties of transport and the need for a substantial buffer stock. \"The goods that come into this country are distributed to where they belong,\" said Hans von Sponeck. \"Our most recent stock analysis shows that 88.8% of all humanitarian supplies have been distributed.\" The representatives of Unicef, the World Food Programme and the Food and Agricultural Organisation confirmed this. If Saddam Hussein believed he could draw an advantage from obstructing humanitarian aid, he would no doubt do so. However, according to a FAO study: \"The government of Iraq introduced a public food rationing system with effect from within a month of the imposition of the embargo. It provides basic foods at 1990 prices, which means they are now virtually free. This has a life-saving nutritional benefit . . . and has prevented catastrophe for the Iraqi people.\" The rebellion in the UN reaches up to Kofi Annan, once thought to be the most compliant of secretary-generals. Appointed after Madeleine Albright, then the US representative at the UN, had waged a campaign to get rid of his predecessor, Boutros-Boutros Ghali, he pointedly renewed Hans von Sponeck's contract in the face of a similar campaign by the Americans. He shocked them last October when he accused the US of \"using its muscle on the Sanctions Committee to put indefinite 'holds' on more than $700 million worth of humanitarian goods that Iraq would like to buy.\" When I met Kofi Annan, I asked if sanctions had all but destroyed the credibility of the UN as a benign body. \"Please don't judge us by Iraq,\" he said. On January 7, the UN's Office of Iraq Programme reported that shipments valued at almost a billion and a half dollars were \"on hold\". They covered food, health, water and sanitation, agriculture, education. On February 7, its executive director attacked the Security Council for holding up spares for Iraq's crumbling oil industry. \"We would appeal to all members of the Security Council,\" he wrote, \"to reflect on the argument that unless key items of oil industry are made available within a short time, the production of oil will drop . . . This is a clear warning.\" In other words, the less oil Iraq is allowed to pump, the less money will be available to buy food and medicine. According to the Iraqis at the UN, it was US representative on the Sanctions Committee who vetoed shipments the Security Council had authorised. Last year, a senior US official told the Washington Post, \"The longer we can fool around in the [Security] Council and keep things static, the better.\" There is a pettiness in sanctions that borders on vindictiveness. In Britain, Customs and Excise stops parcels going to relatives, containing children's clothes and toys. Last year, the chairman of the British Library, John Ashworth, wrote to Harry Cohen MP that, \"after consultation with the foreign office\", it was decided that books could no longer be sent to Iraqi students. In Washington, I interviewed James Rubin, an under secretary of state who speaks for Madeleine Albright. When asked on US television if she thought that the death of half a million Iraqi children was a price worth paying, Albright replied: \"This is a very hard choice, but we think the price is worth it.\" When I questioned Rubin about this, he claimed Albright's words were taken out of context. He then questioned the \"methodology\" of a report by the UN's World Health Organisation, which had estimated half a million deaths. Advising me against being \"too idealistic\", he said: \"In making policy, one has to choose between two bad choices . . . and unfortunately the effect of sanctions has been more than we would have hoped.\" He referred me to the \"real world\" where \"real choices have to be made\". In mitigation, he said, \"Our sense is that prior to sanctions, there was serious poverty and health problems in Iraq.\" The opposite was true, as Unicef's data on Iraq before 1990, makes clear. The irony is that the US helped bring Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party to power in Iraq, and that the US (and Britain) in the 1980s conspired to break their own laws in order, in the words of a Congressional inquiry, to \"secretly court Saddam Hussein with reckless abandon\", giving him almost everything he wanted, including the means of making biological weapons. Rubin failed to see the irony in the US supplying Saddam with seed stock for anthrax and botulism, that he could use in weapons, and claimed that the Maryland company responsible was prosecuted. It was not: the company was given Commerce Department approval. Denial is easy, for Iraqis are a nation of unpeople in the West, their panoramic suffering of minimal media interest; and when they are news, care is always taken to minimise Western culpability. I can think of no other human rights issue about which the governments have been allowed to sustain such deception and tell so many bare-faced lies. Western governments have had a gift in the \"butcher of Baghdad\", who can be safely blamed for everything. Unlike the be-headers of Saudi Arabia, the torturers of Turkey and the prince of mass murderers, Suharto, only Saddam Hussein is so loathsome that his captive population can be punished for his crimes. British obsequiousness to Washington's designs over Iraq has a certain craven quality, as the Blair government pursues what Simon Jenkins calls a \"low-cost, low-risk machismo, doing something relatively easy, but obscenely cruel\". The statements of Tony Blair and Robin Cook and assorted sidekick ministers would, in other circumstances, be laughable. Cook: \"We must nail the absurd claim that sanctions are responsible for the suffering of the Iraqi people\", Cook: \"We must uphold the sanctity of international law and the United Nations . . .\" ad nauseam. The British boast about their \"initiative\" in promoting the latest Security Council resolution, which merely offers the prospect of more Kafkaesque semantics and prevarication in the guise of a \"solution\" and changes nothing. What are sanctions for? Eradicating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, says the Security Council resolution. Scott Ritter, a chief UN weapons inspector in Iraq for five years, told me: \"By 1998, the chemical weapons infrastructure had been completely dismantled or destroyed by UNSCOM (the UN inspections body) or by Iraq in compliance with our mandate. The biological weapons programme was gone, all the major facilities eliminated. The nuclear weapons programme was completely eliminated. The long range ballistic missile programme was completely eliminated. If I had to quantify Iraq's threat, I would say [it is] zero.\" Ritter resigned in protest at US interference; he and his American colleagues were expelled when American spy equipment was found by the Iraqis. To counter the risk of Iraq reconstituting its arsenal, he says the weapons inspectors should go back to Iraq after the immediate lifting of all non-military sanctions; the inspectors of the international Atomic Energy Agency are already back. At the very least, the two issues of sanctions and weapons inspection should be entirely separate. Madeleine Albright has said: \"We do not agree that if Iraq complies with its obligations concerning weapons of mass destruction, sanctions should be lifted.\" If this means that Saddam Hussein is the target, then the embargo will go on indefinitely, holding Iraqis hostage to their tyrant's compliance with his own demise. Or is there another agenda? In January 1991, the Americans had an opportunity to press on to Baghdad and remove Saddam, but pointedly stopped short. A few weeks later, they not only failed to support the Kurdish and Shi'a uprising, which President Bush had called for, but even prevented the rebelling troops in the south from reaching captured arms depots and allowed Saddam Hussein's helicopters to slaughter them while US aircraft circled overhead. At they same time, Washington refused to support Iraqi opposition groups and Kurdish claims for independence. \"Containing\" Iraq with sanctions destroys Iraq's capacity to threaten US control of the Middle East's oil while allowing Saddam to maintain internal order. As long as he stays within present limits, he is allowed to rule over a crippled nation. \"What the West would ideally like,\" says Said Aburish, the author, \"is another Saddam Hussein.\" Sanctions also justify the huge US military presence in the Gulf, as Nato expands east, viewing a vast new oil protectorate stretching from Turkey to the Caucasus. Bombing and sanctions are ideal for policing this new order: a strategy the president of the American Physicians for Human Rights calls \"Bomb Now, Die Later\". The perpetrators ought not be allowed to get away with this in our name: for the sake of the children of Iraq, and all the Iraqs to come \u00a9 John Pilger Paying the Price: Killing The Children Of Iraq, a documentary by John Pilger and Alan Lowery, will be on ITV this Monday at 9.30pm.",

For example, fold-out chairs make you more aware of the joy of sitting, and a fold-away bed helps you sleep better, because you know that the alternative would be sleeping standing up. Fold-up furniture also has a built-in slapstick factor, in that it's likely to fold up with you still in it. This slapstick factor is not always a good thing - you would, for example, hesitate before doing serious business with somebody who uses a folding bicycle. </p> <p>Folding things does three things: it makes things smaller, it makes them squarer and it gives you nice edges. That's why you can't get a folding blancmange. Folding is about control and order and discipline. It can also be an incredibly frustrating and boring thing to do: too much of it, and you end up wanting to cause havoc and destruction. That's why basic army training consists of folding things followed by bayonet practice. </p> <p>Folding is an art, and if you've ever seen someone try to fold a large newspaper in a crowded train you'll know that few have the required artistry. </p> <p>If you think you can fold things, try opening out an Ordnance Survey map and then folding it back so that all the creases go the same way. Research has shown that the likelihood of folding a map so that it goes back the same way it was before you unfolded it is less than being hit by a block of frozen urine jettisoned from a passing airliner.</p>",

For example, fold-out chairs make you more aware of the joy of sitting, and a fold-away bed helps you sleep better, because you know that the alternative would be sleeping standing up. Fold-up furniture also has a built-in slapstick factor, in that it's likely to fold up with you still in it. This slapstick factor is not always a good thing - you would, for example, hesitate before doing serious business with somebody who uses a folding bicycle. Folding things does three things: it makes things smaller, it makes them squarer and it gives you nice edges. That's why you can't get a folding blancmange. Folding is about control and order and discipline. It can also be an incredibly frustrating and boring thing to do: too much of it, and you end up wanting to cause havoc and destruction. That's why basic army training consists of folding things followed by bayonet practice. Folding is an art, and if you've ever seen someone try to fold a large newspaper in a crowded train you'll know that few have the required artistry. If you think you can fold things, try opening out an Ordnance Survey map and then folding it back so that all the creases go the same way. Research has shown that the likelihood of folding a map so that it goes back the same way it was before you unfolded it is less than being hit by a block of frozen urine jettisoned from a passing airliner.",

      "bodyText": "The Labour MP Jimmy Wray is known in the Commons as a fighter and yesterday he won his toughest battle yet when a judge awarded him \u00a360,000 in damages for newspaper claims that he had beaten his former wife. Mr Wray, 64, the MP for Glasgow Baillieston, had sued Associated Newspapers for defamation over a front page story in the Mail on Sunday in 1998 in which his ex-wife, Catherine, claimed he had punched her, grabbed her throat and held a knife to her neck during their troubled 12-year marriage. The case was heard at the court of session in Edinburgh last month, and in his judgment yesterday Lord Johnston said he considered Mr Wray an honest man who felt deeply wronged. Lord Johnston said there was insufficient evidence to support the Mail on Sunday article. The newspaper had claimed its story was true. \"In this day and age when not every member of the Westminster parliament had been shown to have clean hands with regard to his public life and private life, the type of allegation in this article must reflect very seriously on the political position of an MP,\" Lord Johnston wrote. \"Privately, the impact of this article must have been devastating in the short term, and very stressful in the long term, even if the effects are now diminishing,\" he added. Mr Wray, speaking at his Glasgow home with his new wife, Laura, and their young son, Frankie, said he had suffered personally and professionally from the allegations. He had originally sought \u00a31.5m, a figure which had changed to \u00a3140,000 during his action. \"My reputation was on the line. You have to go where angels fear to tread and I have been a fighter all my life,\" he said. \"I would never have backed down. These allegations were false, they were fabricated and there was no evidence to back them up whatsoever. I got the right result and deserved to get the right result,\" Mr Wray added. He declined to comment further on the claims by his ex-wife, whom he had portrayed in court as an insecure drunk who was obsessed with his money and came at him with knives \"countless times\". \"It was a rotten thing to do. It was evil,\" he said. \"Let her get on with her life and let me get on with mine.\" Catherine Wray told the court she had been paid \u00a325,500 for the story at a time when she was struggling to survive financially. She claimed she had received medical treatment for abuse she frequently suffered at his hands during their marriage. Lord Johnston said the manner in which the story had been sold during divorce proceedings \"must at least raise a question mark over the motive behind the whole exercise\". A spokesman for Associated Newspapers said: \"We are very disappointed with the verdict and are actively considering an appeal.\" Mr Wray is renowned in parliamentary circles as a die-hard socialist, cut from the cloth of old Labour and shaped by a life in Glasgow politics. He became an MP more than 30 years ago after a string of make-do jobs as a chimney sweep, a rag and bone man, a coal man and a lorry driver. Mr Wray's deprived childhood is legendary in the Commons. He grew up in a family of 10 in a room and kitchen in the tough Gorbals area of Glasgow, and all his clothes were bought at army surplus stores. He became fed up, he famously joked to the house during one debate, of always going to school dressed as a Japanese general. He was a fighter, too, brawling in the street as a youth. \"You just learnt to defend yourself,\" he told the Guardian in 1998. \"That was the Gorbals way.\"",

His bank manager was totally happy with the way he ran the farm.</p> <p>Devon and Cornwall police yesterday defended the decision to bring the prosecution, claiming the circumstances of Mrs White's death were at variance with the accounts given by her husband.</p> <p>\"It was felt there were a number of questions that needed to be answered,\" Detective Superintendent Chris Borland said after the verdict.</p> <p>Mrs White's mother, Madeline Vian, said her family was satisfied with the verdict.</p> <p>\"We feel that some of the unanswered questions have been answered about what happened on that dreadful day.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A farmer is considering taking civil action against the police after a jury yesterday cleared him of murdering his wife by crushing her to death with a heavy piece of farm machinery. Rosie White, 42, died beneath the metal teeth of a power harrow on the couple's farm near Roche, Cornwall, in July, 1998. The prosecution had alleged that John White lured her under the machine to help with repairs before deliberately dropping the harrow on her by flicking a switch in the cab of his tractor. But the jury at Truro crown court accepted that Mrs White's death had been a tragic accident, taking just 75 minutes to deliver a unanimous not guilty verdict at the end of a nine day trial. Mr White, 49, who told the court his wife must have darted underneath the harrow to rescue her pet puppy, said he had been through \"18 months of sheer hell\" and now wanted to return to running the farm and bringing up the couple's three sons. \"I'm glad that it's all over. I just hope we can get on with our lives now.\" As Mr White expressed the hope of being able to get back to \"some sort of normality\", his solicitor, John Evans, launched a fierce attack on the way police allegedly handled the case. \"I personally have been ap palled at the number of witnesses I have spoken to in the course of this trial who have been browbeaten by the police over a period of many hours. \"I don't think that is acceptable. We will be contemplating further proceedings but I am not prepared to say any more at this stage.\" During his eight hours in the witness box, Mr White had sobbed as he told the jury how he found his wife's body, a discovery that still haunted him. He not seen his wife when he got out of the cab of the tractor and thought she must have wandered off. It was not until four hours later that he started to worry. He came back to the tractor and found her legs sticking out from under the harrow. After finding the body shortly after 6pm on July 24, 1998, he called 999 and begged paramedics not to use lights and sirens so as not to alarm the couple's three boys who were playing nearby. He said he had no real explanation for the accident, but there was \"no reason in this world\" why he would ever have wanted to harm his wife to whom he had been married for 18 years. He denied rumours that he had been having an affair with his wife's best friend and neighbour, Jackie Warne, or that he was in financial difficulties. The court heard that White stood to gain \u00a380,000 in insurance following his wife's death and that the accounts of Higher Brynn Farm were \u00a356,000 overdrawn at the time she died. But Mr White told the jury the farm had always made a profit and was now in credit. His bank manager was totally happy with the way he ran the farm. Devon and Cornwall police yesterday defended the decision to bring the prosecution, claiming the circumstances of Mrs White's death were at variance with the accounts given by her husband. \"It was felt there were a number of questions that needed to be answered,\" Detective Superintendent Chris Borland said after the verdict. Mrs White's mother, Madeline Vian, said her family was satisfied with the verdict. \"We feel that some of the unanswered questions have been answered about what happened on that dreadful day.\"",

Derek Longmuir, 48, who was the drummer of the 1970s tartan rock band, pleaded guilty at Edinburgh sheriff court yesterday to two charges of possessing indecent films, photos, videos and computer images of children. Longmuir, a nurse at Edinburgh royal infirmary, claimed the material belonged to a friend. He also admitted downloading four indecent pictures from the internet on his computer, but said it was only curiosity while taking a break from studying for a nursing degree. Sentence was deferred until March 24 for a psychiatric and other reports, and Longmuir was released on bail. Longmuir was found with dozens of videos and films and more than 100 computer images of child porn when police, acting on a tipoff, raided his home in September 1998. Officers who interviewed him said he had been in a state of shock. Robbie Burnett, defending, said his client was not a paedophile and had been storing the pornography for a friend who had bought it in Portugal and left it with Longmuir when he returned to the United States. However, because Longmuir had been aware of the indecent content of the material he had pleaded guilty to the charges, Mr Burnett said. The Bay City Roller was unrecognisable from his days in tartan bell bottoms and platforms. Dressed in a navy blue suit, he sat nervously in the dock as his offences were read to the court. Asking the sheriff not to consider a jail sentence, Mr Burnett said Longmuir was a respected nurse and offered the court references from hospital colleagues. Longmuir had lost the bulk of the vast amounts of money he should have earned as a Bay City Roller to agents, managers, record companies and legal representatives, and had now to work hard for a living, said Mr Burnett. After a short-lived career as a property developer during the 1980s, Longmuir had qualified as a nurse five years ago. He and his brother, Alan, who played bass guitar, founded the group with singer Les McKeown and guitarists Stuart Wood and Eric Faulkner; between 1975 and 1978 their singles outsold even the Beatles.

One, though, immediately catches the eye, advertising Accorn, the Catholic marriage guidance agency.</p> <p>Another reveals the church's latest accounts. It shows wages for three priests and other staff came to Ir\u00a347,406.28 last year, approximately \u00a339,500. It is now saving on one of those salaries.</p> <p>Father Sean Page, 41, walked out just over a month ago. He has now set up home with Marie Leydon, a married mother of seven, setting tongues wagging in the west of Ireland town and alarm bells ringing at Catholic church headquarters in Dublin.</p> <p>They are no Richard Chamberlain or Rachel Ward, handsome stars of the television adaption of Colleen McCullough's ecclesiastical love story, The Thorn Birds.</p> <p>They now live in a grim council estate rather than on the wide expanses of the fictional Drogheda, Australia-style. Their tale, though, is true.</p> <p>It is the biggest such controversy to hit the Catholic hierarchy in Ireland since Bishop Eamonn Casey fled to south America after it was revealed he had fathered a child in 1973 to an American divorcee, Annie Murphy.</p> <p>He is now believed to be living in England.</p> <p>Father Page will say mass for the first time in six weeks at a special service at the Southern Hotel in Sligo tomorrow. With him will be renegade Bishop Pat Buckley, whose liberal views have put him on collision course with his former paymasters.</p> <p>Father Page says: \"This is no crusade against the Catholic church. But I spent 10 years in training and 10 more at St Anne's. It would be wrong to walk away from all of that.\"</p> <p>Sligo is bitterly divided. Some people come up to Father Page, shake his hand, and wish him well.</p> <p>One man calls at the door to ask some pastoral advice, prefering that to going to St Anne's.</p> <p>Many disapprove of the relationship. But others are instead angry about the way he quit the church, outlining his case in interviews with the Irish media rather than explaining from the pulpit.</p> <p>The Catholic church rejects suggestions that the episode cuts to the core of the celibacy debate, now seen as the biggest single barrier to attracting new recruits. It said yesterday: \"It is his decision. There is nothing that can be done now about it.\"</p> <p>Bishop Buckley believes there are scores of priests engaged in clandestine sexual relationships and more still who quit, unable to obey their celibacy vows. The difference is they depart quietly.</p> <p>But Father Page is happy to receive visitors at the three-bedroom home he now shares with Ms Leydon, 40, and her children, David, 13, Michelle 12, Niall, 11, Colm, nine, Brian, eight, Kenneth, six, and Diarmuid Sean, two. His calm life in the parochial house is gone forever, swapped for nappy changing, mass breakfast-making and struggling for the first time with laundry.</p> <p>The children's father had split from Ms Leydon, now using her maiden name, when she was four weeks pregnant with her last child. She had known Father Page for nine years through St Anne's youth club, but the pair began to become close from June 1998 when he was counselling her over her marriage break-up.</p> <p>He says: \"I began coming round here more often than would be normal. It started off once a day, twice, and then three times. Everyone in the town got to know about it, but, although our feelings were developing, it was a platonic relationship back then.</p> <p>\"I came here for Christmas dinner rather than go to the bishop's. It was then we decided to make a go of it together.\"</p> <p>His bishop, Christopher Jones, in late January issued Father Page with an ultimatum to choose. The couple immediately fled with the children to Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, at the end of January.

      "bodyText": "In the porch of St Anne's Church in Sligo, Co Mayo, there are a myriad of notices - for Alcoholics Anonymous, Alzheimer's help groups and organisations helping those with family members in jail. One, though, immediately catches the eye, advertising Accorn, the Catholic marriage guidance agency. Another reveals the church's latest accounts. It shows wages for three priests and other staff came to Ir\u00a347,406.28 last year, approximately \u00a339,500. It is now saving on one of those salaries. Father Sean Page, 41, walked out just over a month ago. He has now set up home with Marie Leydon, a married mother of seven, setting tongues wagging in the west of Ireland town and alarm bells ringing at Catholic church headquarters in Dublin. They are no Richard Chamberlain or Rachel Ward, handsome stars of the television adaption of Colleen McCullough's ecclesiastical love story, The Thorn Birds. They now live in a grim council estate rather than on the wide expanses of the fictional Drogheda, Australia-style. Their tale, though, is true. It is the biggest such controversy to hit the Catholic hierarchy in Ireland since Bishop Eamonn Casey fled to south America after it was revealed he had fathered a child in 1973 to an American divorcee, Annie Murphy. He is now believed to be living in England. Father Page will say mass for the first time in six weeks at a special service at the Southern Hotel in Sligo tomorrow. With him will be renegade Bishop Pat Buckley, whose liberal views have put him on collision course with his former paymasters. Father Page says: \"This is no crusade against the Catholic church. But I spent 10 years in training and 10 more at St Anne's. It would be wrong to walk away from all of that.\" Sligo is bitterly divided. Some people come up to Father Page, shake his hand, and wish him well. One man calls at the door to ask some pastoral advice, prefering that to going to St Anne's. Many disapprove of the relationship. But others are instead angry about the way he quit the church, outlining his case in interviews with the Irish media rather than explaining from the pulpit. The Catholic church rejects suggestions that the episode cuts to the core of the celibacy debate, now seen as the biggest single barrier to attracting new recruits. It said yesterday: \"It is his decision. There is nothing that can be done now about it.\" Bishop Buckley believes there are scores of priests engaged in clandestine sexual relationships and more still who quit, unable to obey their celibacy vows. The difference is they depart quietly. But Father Page is happy to receive visitors at the three-bedroom home he now shares with Ms Leydon, 40, and her children, David, 13, Michelle 12, Niall, 11, Colm, nine, Brian, eight, Kenneth, six, and Diarmuid Sean, two. His calm life in the parochial house is gone forever, swapped for nappy changing, mass breakfast-making and struggling for the first time with laundry. The children's father had split from Ms Leydon, now using her maiden name, when she was four weeks pregnant with her last child. She had known Father Page for nine years through St Anne's youth club, but the pair began to become close from June 1998 when he was counselling her over her marriage break-up. He says: \"I began coming round here more often than would be normal. It started off once a day, twice, and then three times. Everyone in the town got to know about it, but, although our feelings were developing, it was a platonic relationship back then. \"I came here for Christmas dinner rather than go to the bishop's. It was then we decided to make a go of it together.\" His bishop, Christopher Jones, in late January issued Father Page with an ultimatum to choose. The couple immediately fled with the children to Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, at the end of January. They say it was only then their relationship became physical. They are now back in Sligo, waiting for the first dole cheque. The couple think they will receive about Ir\u00a3200 a week, and Father Page is learning the value of money for the first time. \"I used to get Ir\u00a3610 in my pocket each month, though my lodgings and food was all paid for. \u00a330 would do me all week. Now it is all gone after buying three bags of shopping.\" Father Page, who peppers his speech with language more typically associated with blue collar workers, says his feelings changed when the youngest son started to call him daddy. He says: \"You don't want to feck about with a young boy's feelings.\" His relationship, he admits, is in part about conquering the loneliness, which he used to suppress through heavy drinking. He came off the booze two years ago, and sees his relationship with his new partner and the children as a package. He believes celibacy places a terrible burden on priests. He thinks it makes it impossible for them properly to advise on many issues. The couple plan to marry in a civil ceremony when Ms Leydon's divorce comes through this year. She said: \"We should have met 20 years ago. He is an amazing man, and we are both truly happy for the first time. I doubt if anyone will give two hoots about this in a few months' time.\"",

      "bodyText": "Britain's first entirely postal election will be held in a local government experiment in May designed to raise abysmal levels of voting in a council denounced as a Labour \"rotten borough\". In the Conisbrough ward of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, 10,900 households will be asked to update the electoral register this month and then vote exclusively by post. Voters will be sent ballot papers at least 10 days before the election, with a letter requiring signatures from themselves and a witness to deter fraud. The ballot will come with two pre-paid envelopes to ensure that the vote itself remains secret. The experiment has been approved by the home office and all main political parties as one of a number of pilot schemes sanctioned by the representation of the people bill, which is due to get final parliamentary approval before May. It follows an initiative to change voting at a Conisbrough byelection in November from the customary Thursday to a weekend, which fell foul of previous legislation. In spite of a barrister's opinion that the law banning weekend voting was worth testing, Doncaster altered the vote to a Friday - and turnout dropped from the low twenties to 16%. The seat was held by Labour, whose previous councillor triggered the byelection when he was one of the Doncaster members jailed for expenses fraud. Reformers in Doncaster have qualms about the postal pilot because of security concerns and the problems of monitoring thousands of voters' and witnesses' signatures. Former Labour councillor Ron Rose, chief whistleblower over the \"Donnygate\" scandal which led to the expenses charges and a continuing inquiry into other alleged corruption, said yesterday: \"Organising mass witness statements would be very easy to do and regrettably is in the tradition of groups in Doncaster in the past which effectively decided local council policy.\" Mr Rose, a playwright working on a TV series based on the Donnygate scandal, said all-postal voting was easier to manipulate than the polling station system. \"I can well imagine the sort of vote organising which could go on round here if, for instance, a candidate became known for having pro-abortion views.\" Councillor Bev Marshall, chairman of Doncaster's corporate services panel, said: \"I hope the people of Conisbrough will take up the challenge and prove to the rest of the country that an all-postal ballot will be a success.\"",

His memory conjured 100,000 people - last night's official Staffordshire police count - of all ages onto the streets despite a wet, cramping wind for a funeral parade fit for a Victorian monarch. And all this for a prodigy whose prime 50 years ago, as his soccer colleague Jimmy Hill said in wonder, is known to young people only from scratchy old newsreels. </p> <p>An estimated 10,000 were at Stoke City's Britannia stadium, another 20,000 in or outside St Peter's church, where his quick spirit was laid to rest, with his great fellow players Nat Lofthouse, Sir Tom Finney, Sir Bobby Charlton and Gordon Banks among his pallbearers. </p> <p>Others lined pavements often 10ft to 12ft deep and mounted the roofs of department stores along the 14-mile route as the cortege passed places dear to him in the six Potteries towns: Longton, Fenton, Hanley, Burslem, Tunstall and Stoke itself. </p> <p>In one of the drabber parts of Stoke, miles from the official route, someone had tied a bouquet to a wire fence with a card saying \"Stan the Man, Rest in Peace - from an Evertonian\". </p> <p>Hundreds more bouquets were more conspicuously left outside the front door of Britannia stadium, although his family had asked for no flowers. Along the two-mile road to the ground, Sir Stanley Matthews Way, red and white shirts and scarves in the Stoke colours were wrapped round lamp posts and pavement bollards like heraldic banners in a mediaeval court. </p> <p>The note of wonder and informality continued in church, where the first hymn listed was And Did Those Feet?, usually called Blake's Jerusalem, and the second, chosen by Matthews' family, was Lord of the Dance. Many of the 300 fans who were given a third of the church seats draped Stoke City scarves over their gallery balcony. </p> <p>But the watchword of the day was respect. Cheers began in a few throats and a few fists punched the air. But these gestures were choked off by the collective mood of the crowds. </p> <p>Instead, there was applause. It started in the cortege's journey of honour through the three-year-old, \u00a314.7m stadium, on an exposed hill above the towns. Hands were at first too cold to clap loudly or without pain. </p> <p>But they persisted and warmed into the first of a series of great, solemn, minutes-long ovations of respect which were repeated wherever the motorcade travelled on its 75-minute tour. </p> <p><strong> Accessible magic</strong><br> </p> <p> Noticeably, they were as warm for the cars carrying members of Matthews' family as for the leading hearse, decked with red roses and white carnations in the shape of a football jumper carrying the number seven, his playing position. </p> <p>As the rector of Stoke, Canon Edgar Ruddock, said in St Peter's, the day marked \"the passing of a hero into the folklore and mythology of Stoke City, Port Vale, Blackpool - and through them into the worldwide community of sport\". </p> <p>It also marked the passing of a different kind of England, one which was thought to have been almost forgotten long before he died, a country in which modesty was respected or worshipped almost as much as popular virtuosity. </p> <p>Matthews was a hero of 1940s and 1950s children's cigarette cards and comic books as well as newsreels. He was the real-life counterpart of Wilson the Wonder Man who - long before Roger Bannister - once ran a mile in a still unbeaten 3min 43sec, wearing a black, long-sleeved Victorian bathing costume. Matthews' wizard dribbles were viewed as almost as remarkable. </p> <p>But his was a more accessible magic. Anyone could grow up to be like him if they trained very hard, went to bed at 9pm and never got big-headed. His fitness was again drummed in by yesterday's speeches. </p> <p>\"I never once saw him out of breath in the football field\", said the former England player Jimmy Armfield. Peter Coates, ex-Stoke City chairman, said: \"He never criticised the modern game. He never said players weren't as good as in his day.\" </p> <p>His world has been dismissed to the remote past. But yesterday among the street crowds and at Britannia stadium there was a sense even among younger fans that its virtues ought to be brought back. </p> <p>Duncan Bagnall, a 35-year-old local government worker, said: \"It seems like something's gone now. He embodied something that was perfect. Later people like Gary Linker have tried to do it but never quite managed it\". </p> <p>Yesterday's turnout was not only for the wizard of dribble, or Der Zauberer (the sorcerer) as German players called him, but for a local hero who was given his nickname by Keele students in a song they wrote after his 1965 knighthood: \"You've heard of Greaves and Puskas and Pele from Brazil/But Stanley Matthews of the Potts is the greatest of them all.\" </p> <p>And so his funeral procession, looping and dog-legging through the small brick streets and ring roads of the modern Pot teries, took in not only his statue, where spectators stood with bowed heads as the hearse passed, but his primary school and his birthplace in Seymour Street, Hanley. </p> <p>The house stands only just over half a mile from the birthplace of Arnold Bennett, novelist of five of the towns. Bennett, influenced by sombre French realists, said: \"Pessimism -when you get used to it - is just as agreeable as optimism.\" </p> <p>Matthews' feet spoke for the more gladsome side of Stoke, which gave him back full-hearted gratitude at his funeral. \"The ball ran for me,\" he used to say after a good match. As it did, for him and for his kind, on one final farewell day yesterday.</p>",

Accessible magic Noticeably, they were as warm for the cars carrying members of Matthews' family as for the leading hearse, decked with red roses and white carnations in the shape of a football jumper carrying the number seven, his playing position. As the rector of Stoke, Canon Edgar Ruddock, said in St Peter's, the day marked \"the passing of a hero into the folklore and mythology of Stoke City, Port Vale, Blackpool - and through them into the worldwide community of sport\". It also marked the passing of a different kind of England, one which was thought to have been almost forgotten long before he died, a country in which modesty was respected or worshipped almost as much as popular virtuosity. Matthews was a hero of 1940s and 1950s children's cigarette cards and comic books as well as newsreels. He was the real-life counterpart of Wilson the Wonder Man who - long before Roger Bannister - once ran a mile in a still unbeaten 3min 43sec, wearing a black, long-sleeved Victorian bathing costume. Matthews' wizard dribbles were viewed as almost as remarkable. But his was a more accessible magic. Anyone could grow up to be like him if they trained very hard, went to bed at 9pm and never got big-headed. His fitness was again drummed in by yesterday's speeches. \"I never once saw him out of breath in the football field\", said the former England player Jimmy Armfield. Peter Coates, ex-Stoke City chairman, said: \"He never criticised the modern game. He never said players weren't as good as in his day.\" His world has been dismissed to the remote past. But yesterday among the street crowds and at Britannia stadium there was a sense even among younger fans that its virtues ought to be brought back. Duncan Bagnall, a 35-year-old local government worker, said: \"It seems like something's gone now. He embodied something that was perfect. Later people like Gary Linker have tried to do it but never quite managed it\". Yesterday's turnout was not only for the wizard of dribble, or Der Zauberer (the sorcerer) as German players called him, but for a local hero who was given his nickname by Keele students in a song they wrote after his 1965 knighthood: \"You've heard of Greaves and Puskas and Pele from Brazil/But Stanley Matthews of the Potts is the greatest of them all.\" And so his funeral procession, looping and dog-legging through the small brick streets and ring roads of the modern Pot teries, took in not only his statue, where spectators stood with bowed heads as the hearse passed, but his primary school and his birthplace in Seymour Street, Hanley. The house stands only just over half a mile from the birthplace of Arnold Bennett, novelist of five of the towns. Bennett, influenced by sombre French realists, said: \"Pessimism -when you get used to it - is just as agreeable as optimism.\" Matthews' feet spoke for the more gladsome side of Stoke, which gave him back full-hearted gratitude at his funeral. \"The ball ran for me,\" he used to say after a good match. As it did, for him and for his kind, on one final farewell day yesterday.",

This is despite the original allegations against them being withdrawn in January 1997, before their houses were raided and they were suspended. Last December they were cleared of all criminal proceedings, but they remain suspended.</p> <p>\"I have been suspended in relation to a complaint that is six years old.This has caused the complete destruction of every aspect of my personal and professional life, friends, finanacial security, family, marriage, career and reputation,\" Redgrave said. \"The building blocks of life have all gone with no hope of recovery.\"</p> <p>Nightshade was an Anglo-American police sting across three continents. It had three lines of inquiry - a cocaine shipment from Venezuela to the UK, a money laundering scam and an illegal arms deal.</p> <p>Nightshade started in June 1993 from information provided by a Kent businessman Geoffrey Brennan, who had unusual contacts with some notorious south-east London gangsters. Brennan became an informant for the Met and was handled by Charman.</p> <p>Brennan was then contacted by a group of Texas-based criminals who boasted of high political connections. They involved him in the money laundering scam and asked if he could find a buyer for arms worth millions of dollars.</p> <p>Brennan was authorised to introduce two British undercover officers posing as representatives of Protestant terrorists from Northern Ireland. After bugging meetings in London and Houston, Red grave's team had strong evidence against the gang. They were taped saying the weapons would be stolen from an army base in the US and shipped to Ireland via Sierra Leone.</p> <p>But at a delicate point in the arms negotiations Nightshade began to fall apart. In August 1993, two months into the sting, Brennan was charged with the theft of \u00a3400,000. This money had been deposited in his business account by the Texan gang as part of their money laundering scam.</p> <p>Police documents seen by the Guardian show the arms dealers continued to do business with the undercover officers, faxing them price lists and equipment details. The documents also show that Redgrave and his American counterparts were close to arresting the Texan gang.</p> <p>But in late 1994, with negotiations almost finalised, the gang suddenly backed off and Nightshade, which had cost millions of pounds, collapsed with no arrests.</p> <p>Redgrave and Charman went on to other Met operations against organised crime. They believed that Brennan, the informant, was still under investigation for the theft. In fact it was the two detectives who were under investigation.</p> <p>In June 1994, while Redgrave was still trying to arrest the arms dealers, Brennan began a series of secret meetings with Superintendent Roger Gaspar, head of the Met's complaints investigation branch (CIB), the anti-corruption squad.</p> <p>Gaspar was also in charge of a highly secret intelligence cell - dubbed the Ghost Squad - which had begun looking at police officers suspected of major corruption. He taped an interview with Brennan over two days while CIB kept him in hiding. In the transcripts seen by the Guardian Brennan admits stealing \u00a3400,000 during Nightshade and claims he also bunged Redgrave and Charman \u00a350,000 to turn a blind eye.</p> <p>Brennan was introduced to CIB by Detective Sergeant Chris Smith of the Flying Squad. Brennan had been an informant registered to him for 20 years before Operation Nightshade began.</p> <p>As a result of Brennan's allegations, the Ghost Squad targeted Redgrave and Charman using covert surveillance and bugging.

      "bodyText": "Detective Inspector John Redgrave and Detective Constable Michael Charman, two experienced Met detectives, never thought their involvement in Operation Nightshade would destroy their careers. They have been under investigation for six years, three of them secretly, and suspended for three. This is despite the original allegations against them being withdrawn in January 1997, before their houses were raided and they were suspended. Last December they were cleared of all criminal proceedings, but they remain suspended. \"I have been suspended in relation to a complaint that is six years old.This has caused the complete destruction of every aspect of my personal and professional life, friends, finanacial security, family, marriage, career and reputation,\" Redgrave said. \"The building blocks of life have all gone with no hope of recovery.\" Nightshade was an Anglo-American police sting across three continents. It had three lines of inquiry - a cocaine shipment from Venezuela to the UK, a money laundering scam and an illegal arms deal. Nightshade started in June 1993 from information provided by a Kent businessman Geoffrey Brennan, who had unusual contacts with some notorious south-east London gangsters. Brennan became an informant for the Met and was handled by Charman. Brennan was then contacted by a group of Texas-based criminals who boasted of high political connections. They involved him in the money laundering scam and asked if he could find a buyer for arms worth millions of dollars. Brennan was authorised to introduce two British undercover officers posing as representatives of Protestant terrorists from Northern Ireland. After bugging meetings in London and Houston, Red grave's team had strong evidence against the gang. They were taped saying the weapons would be stolen from an army base in the US and shipped to Ireland via Sierra Leone. But at a delicate point in the arms negotiations Nightshade began to fall apart. In August 1993, two months into the sting, Brennan was charged with the theft of \u00a3400,000. This money had been deposited in his business account by the Texan gang as part of their money laundering scam. Police documents seen by the Guardian show the arms dealers continued to do business with the undercover officers, faxing them price lists and equipment details. The documents also show that Redgrave and his American counterparts were close to arresting the Texan gang. But in late 1994, with negotiations almost finalised, the gang suddenly backed off and Nightshade, which had cost millions of pounds, collapsed with no arrests. Redgrave and Charman went on to other Met operations against organised crime. They believed that Brennan, the informant, was still under investigation for the theft. In fact it was the two detectives who were under investigation. In June 1994, while Redgrave was still trying to arrest the arms dealers, Brennan began a series of secret meetings with Superintendent Roger Gaspar, head of the Met's complaints investigation branch (CIB), the anti-corruption squad. Gaspar was also in charge of a highly secret intelligence cell - dubbed the Ghost Squad - which had begun looking at police officers suspected of major corruption. He taped an interview with Brennan over two days while CIB kept him in hiding. In the transcripts seen by the Guardian Brennan admits stealing \u00a3400,000 during Nightshade and claims he also bunged Redgrave and Charman \u00a350,000 to turn a blind eye. Brennan was introduced to CIB by Detective Sergeant Chris Smith of the Flying Squad. Brennan had been an informant registered to him for 20 years before Operation Nightshade began. As a result of Brennan's allegations, the Ghost Squad targeted Redgrave and Charman using covert surveillance and bugging. This CIB operation was called Cornwall. CIB had plans to turn Brennan into its first supergrass in the anti-corruption crusade. Brennan and his family were put into a witness protection programme with new identities. The theft charges were quietly dropped. For two-and-a-half years from June 1994 to early 1997 the Ghost Squad secretly monitored every move and financial transaction by Redgrave and Charman. Redgrave, 46, had joined the Met in 1970. One commanding officer remarked in an early appraisal: \"When [Redgrave] leaves the division many an east end criminal will breathe a sigh of relief.\" Charman, 47 had joined when he was 19. One of his senior commanders who spoke to the Guardian considers him to be an honest cop who was \"always first through the door\". The Ghost Squad allowed Redgrave and Charman to carry out difficult operations with access to very sensitive material and large sums of money, hoping to catch them in the act. Both detectives received outstanding reports from their line managers. One on Redgrave noted that \"his one desire in life was to arrest and convict major criminals within the law and by ethical means\". There were also commendations from senior Scotland Yard commanders. One of the most bemusing aspects of the affair came in 1996 when the Ghost Squad watched John Redgrave receive a long service and good conduct medal from the then Met Commissioner, Sir Paul Condon, the man who had set up its secret operation. Meanwhile, by August that year, Brennan was completing his second year in CIB's witness protection programme. In September 1996 he was passed to a new CIB controller, Superintendent Dave Bailey, recently appointed head of the Ghost Squad.

      "body": "<p>The Metropolitan police's much vaunted anti-corruption drive, which has been under way for six years, is now itself the subject of three inquiries because of allegations over the way it operates, an investigation by the Guardian has revealed.</p> <p>The inquiries into the complaints investigation branch (CIB), two of them internal and one by an outside force, have been prompted by complaints that the anti-corruption squad, dubbed the Untouchables, used discredited methods to pursue serving and former officers.</p> <p>They include entrapment operations; inducements to supergrasses; non-disclosure to the defence of vital documents in court cases; widespread breaches of laws regulating police evidence-gathering procedures; and double standards in the handling of complaints.</p> <p>One solicitor involved in a recently collapsed trial said aspects of the CIB strategy reflected a return to discredited policing methods prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s.</p> <p>Commander Andy Hayman, director of the CIB, said it was not able to sustain the current effort and was reassessing its methods.</p> <p>In a briefing earlier this week, Scotland Yard said 75 people had been charged with corruption offences, including 26 serving police officers and 11 former officers. Of the 26 serving officers, there have been five convictions and one acquittal, and one is awaiting sentence.</p> <p>The Yard said 70 serving officers had been suspended. What they did not reveal was that the CIB has secured only seven convictions for major corruption in six years. And of those seven, four are of supergrasses - three of them serving police officers who have turned on their former colleagues, and the other a retired detective.</p> <p>Four high-profile court cases have collapsed, and the crown prosecution service has decided not to proceed against more than 80 serving officers - the majority of them named by the supergrasses.</p> <p>Of the 70 officers still suspended, more than two-thirds have not been charged and a significant number, which the Yard will not disclose, have already been cleared internally of any criminal activity.</p> <p>The results are very different to those envisaged in 1994, when the anti-corruption drive was launched amid great secrecy by the then Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Paul Condon.</p> <p>In a dramatic flourish, he pledged there would be \"no hiding place\" for corrupt, dishonest or unethical police officers. In 1997 he told a Commons select committee his intelligence chiefs had identified up to 250 \"bent coppers\", mainly in specialist squads.</p> <p>But the Guardian has learned that as well as an apparent failure to catch and convict corrupt officers on the scale promised, the CIB is being undermined from within - most obviously by its reliance on supergrasses.</p> <p>Serving officers in the Met's organised crime group - the squads that target drug traffickers and armed robbers - said it was ironic that the CIB was relying so heavily on the old supergrass system which the rest of the Met had long since replaced with less problematic methods of evidence gathering, such as infiltration by undercover officers.</p> <p>The CIB has always had a reputation for unconventional methods. Much of its operational strategy is driven by a secret intelligence unit, dubbed the \"ghost squad\".</p> <p>Cmdr Hayman said: \"We are operating within the criminal justice system but that is difficult because we are right at the cutting edge of policing.\"</p> <p>He was keen to \"push the parameters\" of the system to be ahead of the officers being targeted. Cutting-edge methods used in the past include covert surveillance and bugging - inside homes, offices, squad cars and police stations.</p> <p>In one case \u00a3500,000 of cannabis was planted in an east London flat, and word passed to two flying squad officers, who were then caught on video trying to steal the drugs. The pair were convicted and turned supergrass.</p> <p>But even this case went partly wrong when a third officer, who was acquitted, then alleged he had been offered inducements, including a reduced sentence, a safe house, a new identity and financial help on release.</p> <p>Sir John Stevens, who took over as the Met's commissioner last month, was made aware of the problems surrounding CIB tactics after a discreet lunch last November with Lady Emily Blatch, a conservative peer.</p> <p>She told the Guardian she was concerned that the CIB was acting on the basis of \"preordained guilt\" to \"meet targets\". She told Sir John it was important \"to root out corruption without bringing disrepute on the Met\".</p> <p>The CIB denies arrests were made to justify Sir Paul's \"speculation\" that there were up to 250 corrupt officers in the Met. But police sources said there is a secret blacklist of 200 officers, whom the CIB regards as \"untrustworthy\", compiled from intelligence gathered by the ghost squad.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Metropolitan police's much vaunted anti-corruption drive, which has been under way for six years, is now itself the subject of three inquiries because of allegations over the way it operates, an investigation by the Guardian has revealed. The inquiries into the complaints investigation branch (CIB), two of them internal and one by an outside force, have been prompted by complaints that the anti-corruption squad, dubbed the Untouchables, used discredited methods to pursue serving and former officers. They include entrapment operations; inducements to supergrasses; non-disclosure to the defence of vital documents in court cases; widespread breaches of laws regulating police evidence-gathering procedures; and double standards in the handling of complaints. One solicitor involved in a recently collapsed trial said aspects of the CIB strategy reflected a return to discredited policing methods prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s. Commander Andy Hayman, director of the CIB, said it was not able to sustain the current effort and was reassessing its methods. In a briefing earlier this week, Scotland Yard said 75 people had been charged with corruption offences, including 26 serving police officers and 11 former officers. Of the 26 serving officers, there have been five convictions and one acquittal, and one is awaiting sentence. The Yard said 70 serving officers had been suspended. What they did not reveal was that the CIB has secured only seven convictions for major corruption in six years. And of those seven, four are of supergrasses - three of them serving police officers who have turned on their former colleagues, and the other a retired detective. Four high-profile court cases have collapsed, and the crown prosecution service has decided not to proceed against more than 80 serving officers - the majority of them named by the supergrasses. Of the 70 officers still suspended, more than two-thirds have not been charged and a significant number, which the Yard will not disclose, have already been cleared internally of any criminal activity. The results are very different to those envisaged in 1994, when the anti-corruption drive was launched amid great secrecy by the then Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Paul Condon. In a dramatic flourish, he pledged there would be \"no hiding place\" for corrupt, dishonest or unethical police officers. In 1997 he told a Commons select committee his intelligence chiefs had identified up to 250 \"bent coppers\", mainly in specialist squads. But the Guardian has learned that as well as an apparent failure to catch and convict corrupt officers on the scale promised, the CIB is being undermined from within - most obviously by its reliance on supergrasses. Serving officers in the Met's organised crime group - the squads that target drug traffickers and armed robbers - said it was ironic that the CIB was relying so heavily on the old supergrass system which the rest of the Met had long since replaced with less problematic methods of evidence gathering, such as infiltration by undercover officers. The CIB has always had a reputation for unconventional methods. Much of its operational strategy is driven by a secret intelligence unit, dubbed the \"ghost squad\". Cmdr Hayman said: \"We are operating within the criminal justice system but that is difficult because we are right at the cutting edge of policing.\" He was keen to \"push the parameters\" of the system to be ahead of the officers being targeted. Cutting-edge methods used in the past include covert surveillance and bugging - inside homes, offices, squad cars and police stations. In one case \u00a3500,000 of cannabis was planted in an east London flat, and word passed to two flying squad officers, who were then caught on video trying to steal the drugs. The pair were convicted and turned supergrass. But even this case went partly wrong when a third officer, who was acquitted, then alleged he had been offered inducements, including a reduced sentence, a safe house, a new identity and financial help on release. Sir John Stevens, who took over as the Met's commissioner last month, was made aware of the problems surrounding CIB tactics after a discreet lunch last November with Lady Emily Blatch, a conservative peer. She told the Guardian she was concerned that the CIB was acting on the basis of \"preordained guilt\" to \"meet targets\". She told Sir John it was important \"to root out corruption without bringing disrepute on the Met\". The CIB denies arrests were made to justify Sir Paul's \"speculation\" that there were up to 250 corrupt officers in the Met. But police sources said there is a secret blacklist of 200 officers, whom the CIB regards as \"untrustworthy\", compiled from intelligence gathered by the ghost squad.",

But the idea that art might be about losing yourself, destroying reason, is something the British shy away from.

This has to do with a deep change that took place in the British sense of landscape and it can be traced here, in the Lake District, at Wordsworth's Dove Cottage.

In Iran, where the national desire for reform and liberalisation made itself resoundingly felt in the recent elections, last month's Fajr film festival in Tehran opened its doors wide to outside influences, most obviously in the retrospectives of two highly political filmmakers, Constantin Costa-Gavras and Francesco Rosi, both of whom attended. </p> <p>The home crop was led by Smell of Camphor, Fragrance of Jasmine, written and directed by Bahman Farmanara. His first film in 20 years, Farmanara has spent the intervening period in exile in Canada. Smell of Camphor centres on the philosophical reflections of a film director who, similarly, hasn't made a film in two decades, whose wife and three Iranian director friends have died, and who himself now feels death approaching. It is an elegiac, often ironic and amusing meditation that won best screenplay in the international section and best film in the Iranian section. </p> <p>In line with the national mood, the theme of exile may well overtake that of the Iran-Iraq war, which seems to have been largely exorcised. Strangers, a road movie clearly influenced by his own experiences, is a first feature by a 25-year-old US-born Iranian, Ramin Bahrani. Kaveh (played by Bahrani), a young Iranian visiting Iran for the first time to seek out his father's childhood home, meets a truck driver, Abdul, deep in the southern Iranian countryside. He gives him a lift and, albeit unwillingly, deviates from his delivery schedule to help Kaveh find the village and the graveyard of his murdered grandfather. The film has many strengths - not least in highlighting the misplaced notion that the dollar can buy anything. </p> <p>That the most interesting films came from exile directors was further confirmed by One More Day, an impressive first feature by Babak Payami, who was born in Tehran but now lives in Canada. It deals with a chance meeting between a man and a woman at a bus stop; an event which becomes an unspoken daily ritual in which they try to break the isolation and loneliness of their lives. </p> <p>The film follows the man in his wanderings around Tehran dealing in medications as, gradually, we discover that he is a widower and she lives with her brother. The camera moves hardly at all, there is little narrative, and Payami refuses to let anything be hurried: we watch two lives, empty of purpose and joy, become attached by the slenderest of threads which, inevitably, cannot hold them together. </p> <p>The audience award was shared by Bride of Fire and Born in September. The former confronts a tribal tradition in southern Iran that forces young women to marry their first cousin, if he so desires. The heroine, a medical student in Tehran, returns home to ask that her cousin, an illiterate fisherman and cigarette smuggler, waive his rights. He refuses and she finally marries him only to burn herself alive by the marriage bed. </p> <p>Born in September is the story of a young man (played by Iranian screen idol Mohammad Reza Foroutan) and a woman, both Tehran university students involved in political protests which eventually force him to leave the city. She follows, but ultimately he forces her to return to carry on the struggle. While neither of these are particularly impressive movies, it is intriguing that their romantic love stories confront the issues of women's rights and political freedom: to that extent, perhaps, the award reflects the contemporary climate. </p> <p>Iranian cinema guru Abbas Kiarostami continues to write scripts for others, and his influence has produced a new genre of films - represented this year by The Whisper, written and directed by Parviz Chahbazi, and The Willow and the Wind, written by Kiarostami but directed by Mohammad Ali Talebi. Both are disappointing. </p> <p>In The Whisper, three orphan street sellers endlessly seek an adult to accompany them to a clinic so that the youngest boy can be circumcised. In The Willow and the Wind a young boy, breaking a schoolroom window, is told that he cannot attend school until he replaces it. First he has to find the money, then walk miles across country to the glazier and return in appalling weather carrying the pane of glass - only to break it in the classroom. </p> <p>Dariush Mehrjui, whose pre-revolutionary films (The Cow, The Postman and The Cycle) were little short of masterpieces, has been in decline since and Mix, his latest, is a silly, unrevealing comedy about the post-production of a movie in time for a festival screening. </p> <p>Of more interest was Her Eyes, directed and acted by Faramarz Qaribian. Released from jail after 15 years, Mansour (Qaribian) falls in love with the 20-year-old daughter of his former cellmate only to find that the local mobster is also lusting after her. It's beautifully shot, with a commendable sense of film noir and good playing from all the leads. </p> <p>The significance of Farmanara's return to Iran became even more apparent when the minister of culture and Islamic guidance, Ata'ollah Mohajerani, in his closing speech, welcomed him back to Iran and called for others to return. This is surely remarkable (although exiles have been able to visit) but, other imperatives aside, it may be that Mohajerani understands the positive impact that returning directors can have on Iranian cinema when he asked them to reflect on artistic as well as social issues. </p> <p>He also referred to the need to build more cinemas (nearly 200 were burned down during the revolution) and improve the existing ones - apologising to the audience, many of whom had to stand. </p> <p>But, perhaps most importantly, he insisted that Iranian cinema's international success must be maintained: while this year's crop may not have been everything he would have wished, there are exciting signs of a new, more open era dawning. And with Samira Makhmalbaf - director of The Apple - and Abolfazl Jalili in post-production, and Mohsen Makhmalbaf beginning a new film this month, the immediate future looks healthy.</p>",

Things are cooler there, in my communal villa on Haight St: clothes, music, people, drugs, journalism. I've got an assignment for Rolling Stone, the underground magazine founded above a Frisco printer's shop in the Summer of Love: it's a piece on the kidnapping of an heiress by a notorious acid-rock band, which my editor said I could file \"whenever the vibe feels right\". </p> <p>My perception of Rolling Stone's editorial policy in the late 60s might be a shade naive.

Things are cooler there, in my communal villa on Haight St: clothes, music, people, drugs, journalism. I've got an assignment for Rolling Stone, the underground magazine founded above a Frisco printer's shop in the Summer of Love: it's a piece on the kidnapping of an heiress by a notorious acid-rock band, which my editor said I could file \"whenever the vibe feels right\". My perception of Rolling Stone's editorial policy in the late 60s might be a shade naive. But only a shade.

Women make up 44% of the UK labour force, but some have their options closed very early. Lone parenthood, for example, does not confer wide career opportunities, nor do the demands of being carers. Some women are trapped in low-paid jobs or the spiral of poverty and abuse.</p> <p>In third-world countries, the limitations are multiplied. Women's lives there are as demanding as anywhere in Europe or North America, yet their choices are often minimal. Sharp inequalities exist in healthcare and nutrition, education and training, and in earnings. Where men endure hardship and deprivation, women endure them more; where men struggle for access to education and training, women struggle more.</p> <p>This is not because women in these countries have no access to paid work. The figures compare with those in the west; women make up 42% of the workforce in sub-saharan Africa, yet experience fewer benefits from work. A large part of women's work is in low-paid occupations - usually agriculture. In such subsistence economies, they do not have the choice between stay-at-home motherhood or paid employment. They have both.</p> <p>Here, work does not open up choices and lifestyle improvements - indeed, it may close them down. This is partly because the employment of women is not the result of education, but often instead of it. Among Ethiopian women over 25, for example, illiteracy rates are as high as 89%. Their labour is simply needed for survival. They often have little job security and minimal access to further training. They have also little opportunity to accumulate savings, or receive credit.</p> <p>Many of the funding programmes designed to help developing countries have not worked in women's interests. Men have tended to be the beneficiaries of structural adjustment programmes because they spend more time - double that of women - producing marketable goods for export. Yet, the reality of external debt impacts as much on women as on men. So does the experience of being on the wrong end of global trade networks, where what they produce is at the mercy of a first-world pricing system. When we get our goods cheap, it is often third-world women who are picking up the tab.</p> <p>With its global network, the Christian church is in a position to effect real change here. Working in partnership with third-world women, Christian organisations like Tear Fund have been developing educational projects, setting up clinics, extending literacy for girls, installing boreholes for fresh water and initiating new small businesses. Because money from the UK becomes vastly inflated in poor economies, whatever the churches raise can produce extraordinary results. Fair-trading programmes also restructure the trading relationship, paying coffee-bean pickers more, and accepting profits that are less.</p> <p>When women work two-thirds of the world's hours, receive one-tenth of the world's income and own one-hundredth of the world's property, we need the moral will to begin a structural change.

      "body": "<p>Among the cautious organisation men and women of today's publishing world, globalised and accountant-driven, it is not easy to imagine anyone quite like James MacGibbon, who has died aged 88. Not that there was ever anyone quite like James: romantic communist and first publisher of Solzhenitsyn; dandy, ardent sailor, a terrific charmer with a serious interest in labour history, and until almost the end still fairly bouncing into the room, full of grins and all his latest enthusiasms.</p> <p>He was born into a wealthy Scottish commercial family, though his father, who died when James, his youngest son, was 10, had become the minister of Glasgow Cathedral, the Church of Scotland equivalent of an Anglican dean. After schooling at Fettes, then a fairly fierce beating establishment which may have stirred early rebelliousness, he went not to university, but into publishing at 17, after impressing the British head of Putnam &amp; Co, met by chance at a funeral. Arriving in the week that Putnam brought out Erich Remarque's All Quiet On The Western Front (with spectacular success), he quickly decided that publishing was the life for him.</p> <p>For the next few years he shared his mother's Park Lane flat, becoming something of a debs' delight, until another chance encounter, with the head of a big German printing firm, offered a life-changing opportunity - both to escape from his formidable mother and to discover a very different world. He went to Berlin in 1932 as a publishing apprentice, working in Ullstein Verlag and various other firms, encountering the work of the Bauhaus and Expressionist painting, and watching the gathering clouds which were to bring the Nazis to power.</p> <p>It was not until 1936, not long after his marriage to the writer Jean Howard, that a new way of looking at his life - and the way the world was going in that \"low, dishonest decade\" - led him to join the Communist party. Appalled at the way the Spanish republican government was being left to the mercies of Franco and his fascist allies, James and Jean canvassed the British political parties as to what they were going to do about Spain. Only the CP seemed to provide an effective answer, and he campaigned hard in an out of the party, helping also to run a home for Basque orphans. In 1938, he was arrested for writing \"Save the Czechs\" on a Whitehall pavement when Chamberlain returned from Munich.</p> <p>James was, however, never a masochistic prisoner of the party. Essentially, what he had enlisted in was the \"fine old conflict\", and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact didn't prevent him from knowing where the front lay; the day after war was declared, he volunteered for the marines. His good German and knowledge of Berlin quickly got him drafted into military intelligence, eventually serving as GSO2 (Ops) to the British director of planning for the combined chiefs in Washington in 1944. Certainly, he had left the communists by the time of the Hungarian uprising in 1956, and it is unlikely that he had been an active member for many years before that.</p> <p>Back in civilian life, James rejoined Putnam and became managing director before deciding in 1948 to start up his own firm, with his wife, his friend Robert Kee and start-up capital of \u00a36,000. MacGibbon and Kee, until it was taken over and broken up by Granada, was one of the liveliest literary publishing houses of the 50s and early 60s.</p> <p>It may have been at its best in the relatively short period after financial difficulties obliged James to sell to the leftwing property millionaire Howard Samuel - in those years when Doris Lessing joined the list and Tim O'Keeffe was nursing Flann O'Brien back to writing life (as well as introducing to English readers the remarkable Polish expressionist novelist Witold Gombrowicz).</p> <p>But the firm's begetters had laid a fine foundation, launching, among others, the novelist Colin MacInnes, and producing among many diversely good things, novels by Thomas Hinde, Noel Annan's biography of Leslie Stephen, Humphrey Lyttelton's autobiography, some good late essays of Desmond MacCarthy, and a famous children's book which James got Cecil Day Lewis and Edward Ardizzone to make out of the story of the film, Nous, les Gosses.</p> <p>Among his later coups, when he was second-in-command to Victor Gollancz in the early 60s (not his happiest berth), was getting the rights to Solzhenitsyn's One Day In The Life Of Ivan Denisovich. As a literary agent at Curtis Brown, his personal stable of writers included John Le Carr\u00e9 and Rumer Godden.

      "bodyText": "Among the cautious organisation men and women of today's publishing world, globalised and accountant-driven, it is not easy to imagine anyone quite like James MacGibbon, who has died aged 88. Not that there was ever anyone quite like James: romantic communist and first publisher of Solzhenitsyn; dandy, ardent sailor, a terrific charmer with a serious interest in labour history, and until almost the end still fairly bouncing into the room, full of grins and all his latest enthusiasms. He was born into a wealthy Scottish commercial family, though his father, who died when James, his youngest son, was 10, had become the minister of Glasgow Cathedral, the Church of Scotland equivalent of an Anglican dean. After schooling at Fettes, then a fairly fierce beating establishment which may have stirred early rebelliousness, he went not to university, but into publishing at 17, after impressing the British head of Putnam &amp; Co, met by chance at a funeral. Arriving in the week that Putnam brought out Erich Remarque's All Quiet On The Western Front (with spectacular success), he quickly decided that publishing was the life for him. For the next few years he shared his mother's Park Lane flat, becoming something of a debs' delight, until another chance encounter, with the head of a big German printing firm, offered a life-changing opportunity - both to escape from his formidable mother and to discover a very different world. He went to Berlin in 1932 as a publishing apprentice, working in Ullstein Verlag and various other firms, encountering the work of the Bauhaus and Expressionist painting, and watching the gathering clouds which were to bring the Nazis to power. It was not until 1936, not long after his marriage to the writer Jean Howard, that a new way of looking at his life - and the way the world was going in that \"low, dishonest decade\" - led him to join the Communist party. Appalled at the way the Spanish republican government was being left to the mercies of Franco and his fascist allies, James and Jean canvassed the British political parties as to what they were going to do about Spain. Only the CP seemed to provide an effective answer, and he campaigned hard in an out of the party, helping also to run a home for Basque orphans. In 1938, he was arrested for writing \"Save the Czechs\" on a Whitehall pavement when Chamberlain returned from Munich. James was, however, never a masochistic prisoner of the party. Essentially, what he had enlisted in was the \"fine old conflict\", and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact didn't prevent him from knowing where the front lay; the day after war was declared, he volunteered for the marines. His good German and knowledge of Berlin quickly got him drafted into military intelligence, eventually serving as GSO2 (Ops) to the British director of planning for the combined chiefs in Washington in 1944. Certainly, he had left the communists by the time of the Hungarian uprising in 1956, and it is unlikely that he had been an active member for many years before that. Back in civilian life, James rejoined Putnam and became managing director before deciding in 1948 to start up his own firm, with his wife, his friend Robert Kee and start-up capital of \u00a36,000. MacGibbon and Kee, until it was taken over and broken up by Granada, was one of the liveliest literary publishing houses of the 50s and early 60s. It may have been at its best in the relatively short period after financial difficulties obliged James to sell to the leftwing property millionaire Howard Samuel - in those years when Doris Lessing joined the list and Tim O'Keeffe was nursing Flann O'Brien back to writing life (as well as introducing to English readers the remarkable Polish expressionist novelist Witold Gombrowicz). But the firm's begetters had laid a fine foundation, launching, among others, the novelist Colin MacInnes, and producing among many diversely good things, novels by Thomas Hinde, Noel Annan's biography of Leslie Stephen, Humphrey Lyttelton's autobiography, some good late essays of Desmond MacCarthy, and a famous children's book which James got Cecil Day Lewis and Edward Ardizzone to make out of the story of the film, Nous, les Gosses. Among his later coups, when he was second-in-command to Victor Gollancz in the early 60s (not his happiest berth), was getting the rights to Solzhenitsyn's One Day In The Life Of Ivan Denisovich. As a literary agent at Curtis Brown, his personal stable of writers included John Le Carr\u00e9 and Rumer Godden. From his later time as managing director at Macdonald's, where he made Catherine Cookson a world bestseller, and developed a line of good books on naturalism and his great love, sailing, he is remembered as a skilful and encouraging trainer of some of the better publishers of the next two generations. His last job in publishing - more sailing and country books - was with David &amp; Charles, in Newton Abbott, Devon. In retirement, James remained variously active as, for example, publishing adviser to the Melanie Klein Trust (Jean's interest in her work once took the whole family through Kleinian analysis) and as Stevie Smith's literary executor. Late, and lively still, he retreated to Manningtree, North Sea sailing and his last substantial piece of work, the translation of the great Breton bible of sailing lore and practice, The New Glenan's Sailing Manual. James had discovered a passion for sailing during his wartime visit to America, and had subsequently cruised in the Baltic, and off the Dutch, Breton and Irish coasts, but had to give up in his late 70s after being winched on a rough day off the Goodwins with his crew Richard Holmes, biographer of Shelley and Coleridge.

By now his political moorings had long been in CND and the Labour party, serving as an alderman in Camden in the 1960s, and later taking turn about as chairman and treasurer at Manningtree with the Guardian's quondam education correspondent. I think Robert Kee is right when he says that the clue to James MacGibbon - his practically engaged political idealism, his energy and curiosity - was his innocence, in the most active sense of the word. I couldn't imagine anyone calling James \"an old boy\", but that eager, amiable, rebelly boy was alive in him to the end. He is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter.

Since the German parliament moved to Berlin last autumn, while colleagues have been sheltering from the harsh Prussian winter in plush, centrally-heated hotels, Mr Kunick, 59, has been living on a camp site.</p> <p>By choice.</p> <p>\"We get an allowance for our expenses which we can spend as we like,\" he said. \"I decided to spend mine on a new caravan. I am paying it off in instalments at DM750 [\u00a3235] a month\".</p> <p>The caravan came with an awning attached and when the weather was milder, Mr Kunick, a Social Democratic MP from Bremen, used that for shelter instead.</p> <p>\"I'd had an accident with the caravan on the autobahn. I could have gone to a hotel, but the weather was beautiful and there was no reason to move\", he said.</p> <p>Mr Kunick who - it may be noted - turned up late for his interview with the Guardian because of a raging cold, developed a taste for the outdoor life as a boy.</p> <p>\"I was a scout. We used to camp out in Wehrmacht tents left over from the war\".</p> <p>He reached parliament after a varied life that included work as a merchant seaman, rail manager and auditor. Though his unconventional accommodation preference only recently became public knowledge, he said he had taken to living in a caravan shortly after being elected to parliament in 1994 when the capital was still in Bonn.</p> <p>One of the advantages of his lifestyle was that it allowed him spend the least possible time wearing a suit. Mr Kunick said he usually travelled up from the camp site on the outskirts of Berlin dressed casually and with a knapsack on his back, changing into more formal gear at his office on the Unter den Linden.</p> <p>His ascetic way of life has recently come under threat. A previously unknown ultra-rightwing group calling itself the Werewolves named him on a website as one of several politicians who \"needed to be watched\". Mr Kunick said he was concerned that the federal security authorities might order him into more easily protected lodgings.</p> <p>\"I feel my freedom is being cramped,\" he said.</p> <p>It is perhaps an odd take on events, coming from someone who lives in a space measuring 4m by 2m.</p> <p>But Mr Kunick disagrees.</p> <p>\"It's a lot bigger than Job's barrel,\" he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Konrad Kunick chooses his words carefully when asked what his fellow MPs think of him. \"I don't know what they think,\" he says with a sly smile. \"But what they say is that I am rare bird\". This he undeniably is. Since the German parliament moved to Berlin last autumn, while colleagues have been sheltering from the harsh Prussian winter in plush, centrally-heated hotels, Mr Kunick, 59, has been living on a camp site. By choice. \"We get an allowance for our expenses which we can spend as we like,\" he said. \"I decided to spend mine on a new caravan. I am paying it off in instalments at DM750 [\u00a3235] a month\". The caravan came with an awning attached and when the weather was milder, Mr Kunick, a Social Democratic MP from Bremen, used that for shelter instead. \"I'd had an accident with the caravan on the autobahn. I could have gone to a hotel, but the weather was beautiful and there was no reason to move\", he said. Mr Kunick who - it may be noted - turned up late for his interview with the Guardian because of a raging cold, developed a taste for the outdoor life as a boy. \"I was a scout. We used to camp out in Wehrmacht tents left over from the war\". He reached parliament after a varied life that included work as a merchant seaman, rail manager and auditor. Though his unconventional accommodation preference only recently became public knowledge, he said he had taken to living in a caravan shortly after being elected to parliament in 1994 when the capital was still in Bonn. One of the advantages of his lifestyle was that it allowed him spend the least possible time wearing a suit. Mr Kunick said he usually travelled up from the camp site on the outskirts of Berlin dressed casually and with a knapsack on his back, changing into more formal gear at his office on the Unter den Linden. His ascetic way of life has recently come under threat. A previously unknown ultra-rightwing group calling itself the Werewolves named him on a website as one of several politicians who \"needed to be watched\". Mr Kunick said he was concerned that the federal security authorities might order him into more easily protected lodgings. \"I feel my freedom is being cramped,\" he said. It is perhaps an odd take on events, coming from someone who lives in a space measuring 4m by 2m. But Mr Kunick disagrees. \"It's a lot bigger than Job's barrel,\" he said.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Just over a year ago, Evgeny Kissin was asked to name his closest friends. The 28-year-old Russian pianist paused for an agonising 15 seconds before mentioning two Russian conductors, both over twice his age and one of whom he hadn't seen for five years. The message was clear: \"Kissin inhabits a social incubator,\" the questioner confidently declared, \"untouched by human hand, immersed in his playing, unaware of his powers.\"</p> <p>The notion of the mature artistic genius but socially infantile human being is a seductive one, and looking at the bare facts of Kissin's life it is easy to see why it should so persistently attach itself to him. He was a remarkable child prodigy and has become one of the great musical talents of our age, yet he still lives and travels everywhere with his mother and teacher. His manner is, at least initially, extremely disconcerting, with the long pauses before answering questions and luxuriant Eraserhead hair-style only adding to the air of ethereal strangeness. \"He is partly on earth and partly somewhere else\", said Mark Zilberquit, the music critic and author of Russia's Great Modern Pianists. \"He was never a child prodigy, but a small genius. Now he is just a genius.\"</p> <p>Record companies and concert promoters have to an extent colluded in this supposed otherworldliness. \"His image wasn't the sort of thing that promoters would latch onto, like they would sex appeal or something like that,\" says Charles Hamlen, his former manager. \"But there is a kind of mystique to him and seeing that dissolve when he is at the piano is fascinating. Partly it is his total mastery of the instrument. Technically, he can do anything. But that is connected to something more spiritual. You have a sense that when he is making music, he produces on the piano exactly what he hears in his head.\"</p> <p>But while this portrait of the artist makes perfect sense in terms of pop psychology, the actual story is not quite so neat. Kissin had misunderstood the question about his friends, and was trying to name people the interviewer might have heard of. In fact, he has a loyal circle of what anyone would acknowledge as real friends. And they don't recognise the well-rehearsed caricature of him as a man-child savant. </p> <p>On meeting him, the preliminary sense of strangeness can soon wash away. He is surprisingly solidly built, tall, and has a deep voice at odds with his wan image. Toby Hoffman is a viola player who has known Kissin since he was 21. \"When we first met he was a bit shy and insulated by his family,\" says Hoffman. \"But that's not unusual for people who have a musical upbringing. People say it's not healthy that he lives with his family and his teacher, but in reality there is nothing unhealthy about the way he lives. </p> <p> \"When he needs to be on his own he is. It would have been more dangerous if he'd been thrown out to make a career on his own. When the time comes to leave his family, I'm sure he'll do it. He's very intelligent and he knows what he wants to do, and the way he has managed his life has meant his extraordinary talent has not been burned out.\"</p> <p>Kissin's virtuosity and musicality are the stuff of legend. In a world where child prodigies are nothing new, he was always something special. Aged two, he picked out his first tunes on a piano, at 10 made his performing debut with a professional orchestra, and at 11 gave his first recital. In 1984, when he was 12, in the great hall of the Moscow Conservatory he played both Chopin piano concertos, something not attempted since the turn of the century. And while the history of child prodigies is littered with the human wreckage of hopes unfulfilled and talent squandered, his career has been one of uninterrupted progression. At 17, he was asked by Herbert von Karajan to play Tchaikovsky's B flat minor concerto. The great conductor was so entranced by Kissin's performance that, it is said, at one point he forgot to cue in a flute. </p> <p>At the end of Kissin's 1990 Carnegie Hall debut, the conductor Zubin Mehta was so overwhelmed that, when Kissin leaned forward to shake his hand, Mehta grabbed his head and kissed it before virtually flinging the young pianist back at the near-hysterical audience. In 1997, he was the first pianist to give a solo recital at the Proms. He played to the biggest Proms audience ever (over 6,000), and rewarded them with the most-ever encores (seven).</p> <p>\"There are only a few individuals in an incredibly crowded marketplace at the moment who are both superb artists and have broken through to a wider public,\" says Nicholas Kenyon, the Proms director. \"Kissin is one of them. It's something to do with the fantastic concentration he puts into every note and the way he manages to sustain the arch of a piece from beginning to end. These people have to be cherished and we must hope that they are not led astray by that wider success. So far there is no sign whatsoever that Kissin has or will be.\"</p> <p>Amongst his peers he commands an awed respect. \"You see pianists all the time at his concerts,\" says Hamlen, who has now left the industry but remains in close contact with Kissin. \"There's no jealousy, they are just astonished by him. At the end of the Carnegie Hall debut his last encore was a Prokofiev toccata, which is an absolute finger buster. He played it like I'd play Chopsticks. The pianist Andr\u008e Watts, who was next to me, said the only appropriate reaction was to laugh. 'Otherwise I'd just have to go and jump off the George Washington Bridge.' It was astonishing.\" When the pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet, also a precocious young performer, first heard a tape of Kissin he was out driving. He recalls having to pull over, so moved was he by the performance.</p> <p>Kissin displays a mixture of embarrassment and critical prudence when discussing such matters as genius. \"It is a very powerful word. I take it to mean the highest degree of talent and it is often used to describe various other, very high, degrees of talent.\" When pushed to name musicians who qualify, he lists the pianists Carlos Kleiber and Sviatoslav Richter, the singer Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, and conductors Leonard Bernstein and von Karajan. </p> <p>\"Needless to say I would never ascribe it to myself and I am cautious about applying it to others,\" he adds. Very few people are cautious about applying it to him. From almost the very beginning he was identified as a remarkable child. He was born in 1971 in a Moscow hospital specialising in the care of mothers-to-be with heart problems. But the birth was straightforward And his mother, Emilia, has suffered no further heart trouble since. He has one sister, Alla, 10 years older than him, also a talented pianist.</p> <p>His father was an engineer. \"He had a secret job\", says Kissin, \"in a rocket factory.\" Igor Kissin was a Communist party member, but it seems to have been more a requirement of his job than out of overwhelming conviction, although he had the semi-official role of \"agitator\" at work - the person in each group who kept performance up to the mark. \"He used to receive a magazine called The Agitator to advise him how to do it\", says Kissin. \"We had piles of them in the toilet of our country house.\" The family dacha was more of a holiday chalet than a stately pile, with its outside toilet and cold water supply. It had been built by Kissin's grandparents in the 50s when Nikita Khrushchev, former premier of the Soviet Union, allowed small plots of land to be used to grow vegetables. Kissin spent whole summers there as a child.</p> <p>Although Emilia Kissin was a piano teacher, there was little other musical tradition in the family. Kissin has heard that one ancestor played the cello, and his maternal grandfather could also apparently play the mandolin, but there were never any professional musicians. So when the 11-month-old boy, who had been an abnormally quiet baby, suddenly sang the theme of the Bach A major fugue his sister had just been playing on the piano, \"my parents were astonished,\" he says. </p> <p>\"And from that moment on I stared singing everything. Classical, pop songs, anything I heard from the radio or was being played at home. When my parents would take me out I would sing in the street and passers-by would listen and give lots of advice. It is common in Russia to give advice,\" he adds with a smile, \"even to people you don't know and on subjects you know nothing about.\"</p> <p>When young Evgeny, known as Genya to family and friends, was two years and two months old - he is scrupulously accurate about this sort of thing - he was tall enough to reach the piano keyboard, and started to pick out tunes, first with one finger and then with all the rest. At six he was taken to Anna Pavlovna Kantor, a teacher at the Moscow Gnessin school of music for gifted children. Kissin recalls her listening to him playing and \"then she called a couple of other teachers over and I was accepted\".</p> <p>He didn't study in the same way as other pupils. He suffered from bouts of pneumonia in his first three years and the school established a \"free attendance\" regime for him which continued when he was well. Kantor, with no family of her own, has now essentially joined the Kissin family, travelling everywhere with Genya to provide him with \"consultations\", his preferred word to describe their work together.</p> <p>He remembers composing music in bed while he was ill, and that at seven he gave a concert of his own compositions. \"I began improvising as early as I began playing,\" he says. \"So as soon as I learned the notes I began to put music down on paper and whenever I learned something new I would use it for my own compositions.\" He continued composing until his mid teens, by which time he had tried all the different styles from classical through to modern and concluded that, \"I had nothing else to say\". His celebrity was travelling fast and he was a prize exhibit of the Soviet state music system. Kissin was featured on an English language radio programme and recalls his reaction to the huge post-bag it precipitated. </p> <p>One Swedish listener asked for information on his home. \"She asked about my nursery, the living rooms, my office and bedroom,\" he says. \"Everybody who read that letter and knew how I lived laughed. At that time me and my parents and my sister were living in a three room flat of 38 square metres. The living room was a bedroom for my parents and every night and every morning I had to move the furniture. We had a grand piano in my room but to avoid sleeping right next to the radiator I had to move my bed so that my head was under the piano. Then, when I got up, I had to move the furniture again in order to practise.\"</p> <p>The family moved soon after, to a larger home, but only after the head of the composers' union pulled some strings. While Genya's talent made his family eligible for such special treatment, they were still subject to persecution in other ways. As Jews, albeit non-practising, Kissin says they were subject both to systematic anti-Semitism as well as day-to-day indignities. \"My mother didn't get very far in her job,\" he says, \"although she was not very ambitious anyway. And my father, while he had a rather prestigious job, also encountered anti-Semitism. I have never encountered it at an official level but of course I have in daily life, since I was a small child. And it is especially frightening because it comes from other children of the same age.\"</p> <p>The family didn't observe any aspects of Jewish life, partly because they didn't know anything about it, he explains. Kissin says he is now interested in this heritage, but as much in terms of its cultural as religious aspects. He made his performing debut at 10 with Mozart's piano concerto K466, and gave his first solo recital at 11. Marina Bower first saw him play when he was 12. Some years later she became his agent in France and recalls that even then she instantly knew, \"I was in the presence of a phenomenon. It wasn't just a young boy, it was a unique personality.\"</p> <p>But it was when, aged 12, he performed the two Chopin concertos in the Moscow Conservatory with the Moscow State Philharmonic, that news of him spread outside Russia. Dan Gorgolione was working for CBS records in New York. \"Danny Barenboim had brought in this tape and a colleague played it to me. As I listened, tears were literally rolling down my cheeks, so I asked who was playing. I just couldn't believe when I was told it was some 12-year-old Russian boy.\" Similar scenes were being enacted in record company offices throughout the west, but access to Kissin was reserved for a very different set of cultural sponsors.</p> <p>Following the recital he was invited - \"it was not the sort of invitation one declines\" - to perform at the Kremlin to commemorate Lenin's birthday, a bizarre story. The piece he was instructed to play was repeatedly changed, once because it would be one minute too long. He had to play in front of a jury headed by the minister of culture, a chemist by profession, \"who approved of my playing but criticised the orchestra\". </p> <p>On the day of the performance, he was initially denied entrance to the Kremlin because he didn't have an internal passport (children were not issued with them) and then his mother and teacher - who had been placed in a side room with closed-circuit broadcast of the concert - couldn't hear the performance because a song and dance troupe played dominoes so loudly. When his teacher moved her chair closer to the television she was told that moving chairs was forbidden. At the end of the saga Kissin received a letter from an official expressing the hope that he would become a good citizen of the motherland. Last year, he received another special \"invitation\" and played at Prince Charles's 50th birthday party. </p> <p>Kissin says he has no recollection of things getting any more serious as he began to undertake more major engagements. \"Things were serious from the beginning, I was in a school that trained professional musicians.\" But he was increasingly aware of expectations. \"My teacher was always making me conscious of that to motivate me to work harder,\" he says. \"She kept telling me that the higher I was getting the more was being expected from me, and I had to fulfil those expectations.\"</p> <p>While this sounds like one of those horror stories in which gifted children are worked to the bone, in this case his mother and teacher were already beginning effectively to manage the pressures put on him. He only recently found out that the reason the family went to a small town outside Moscow for a few weeks following the Chopin recital was to protect him from \"all the fuss that would follow such a major debut\".</p> <p>His first appearances outside the Soviet Union were in 1985 when he performed in East Berlin and Budapest. He toured Japan in October 1986 and in 1987 made his debut in western Europe at the Berlin Festival. But the race to record him in the west was by now seriously underway.</p> <p>In December 1987 Dan Gorgolione heard that he would be playing in London the following May with the London Symphony Orchestra. \"So I booked the orchestra for the following day. I asked who the conductor of the concert was and I was told, 'some nobody'. It was Valery Gergiev.\"</p> <p>Because Kissin was under 18, his affairs were handled by the ministry of education in Moscow. Gorgolione sent telexes enquiring about recording him but received no reply. \"So there I was with an orchestra booked and no confirmation,\" he recalls. \"Then I saw he was playing in Madrid so I got on the plane and went. After the concert, which he played like God himself, I was taken backstage and introduced by a mutual friend. Genya pointed his finger right at my face and said, 'I make record for you'. Apparently the telexes had got through but they just hadn't bothered to reply.\"</p> <p>The recording, in Walthamstow, was of Rachmaninoff's second concerto. Kissin was nervous, it was his first studio recording, and they only had six hours studio time. It is usual to have twice that. \"But, to his enormous credit, Gergiev got him through\", says Gorgolione. \"He talked to him like he would to a baby brother and he nurtured him along.\"</p> <p>As Kissin's career increasingly spread westward he came under the wing of Charles Hamlen at the International Management Group agency. \"I first heard him play live in this empty, dilapidated ballroom in a hotel in Germany on a dilapidated baby grand piano.

Then he did this incredible pastiche of everything from Bach to Mozart to ragtime, all running into each other. It was hilarious.\"</p> <p>By the time of his American debut in 1990 there was already a huge buzz about him in New York. He first played four concerts with the New York Philharmonic and then 10 days later sold out Carnegie Hall on the opening night of its centenary season. \"I remember people waving $100 bills begging for tickets,\" remembers Hamlen. \"You just knew from the first note that this was something you would talk about 50 years later.\"</p> <p>His triumph whipped up a New York media storm. Every television talk show wanted the young Russian genius but, as Dan Gorgolione recalls, Kissin had little idea what a talk show was and certainly no idea of how to play the game. \"He didn't know how to schmooze, and thought an interview was like an exam where he had to give correct answers.

It was the press who made me think about it. I wouldn't say I'm much interested in it. I think music is above that.\"</p> <p>Since he emigrated he has enjoyed remarkable success. He played at the 1992 Grammy award ceremony to a television audience of 1.5 billion, and has issued a steady stream of highly acclaimed recordings. When Nicholas Kenyon was looking for someone for a special Prom concert Kissin was an obvious choice. The piano was placed in the middle of the vast arena in the Albert Hall. \"I really wanted someone who could sustain a whole solo recital and the thing about Kissin is he just has this unmistakable star quality the moment you hear him play. There was a sense of risk that one instrument in the vast space wouldn't communicate. But from the very beginning people were held by it. The impact was partly due to people standing just a few feet from the piano. There was an extraordinary feeling of intimacy despite having 6,000 people in the hall. He has been back every year since, and will be back again this year.\"</p> <p>This month sees his seventh Chopin recording and the start of a British tour. He complains that the lead times for such events are increasingly restrictive. \"I would prefer not to have to decide upon programmes so early. In the first half of the last century concerts were planned no longer than a few months in advance. Now concerts are planned two or three years ahead and all the managers and promoters demand programmes at least a year in advance. Maybe if I become more famous I will be able to tell the promoters to just say 'programme to be announced'.\"</p> <p>He plays about 60 concerts a year and makes the point that while he learns a new piece in rehearsal, there is no substitute for playing it in front of an audience. \"Rostropovich told me to always start performing a piece before it is completely ready. I find that it can't be completely ready anyway until you have played it several times in public. Rostropovich added that it improves the nervous system as well,\" he smiles.</p> <p>But having now performed professionally for almost two decades, does he ever feel the need to have a break? \"I once took a four-month break,\" he says, \"and I'd like to take a longer break at some stage - not from music but from performing music. It would give me more time to learn new repertoire, read books, perhaps to visit places I didn't have the opportunity to explore when touring. And to make new friends.\"</p> <p>He is godfather to Olivia Flatto's six year old daughter Julia. \"It's the best thing we did,\" says Flatto, who met him on a cultural cruise. \"He's a wonderful godfather. Both our children love him. He even sits at the piano with them and they play Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star. But their enthusiasm can sometimes be a little embarrassing. We have other friends who are musicians and Julia says things like 'you are a pianist, but you are not as good as my godfather'.\" </p> <p>\"I've been out with him until two and three in the morning in New York,\" reports Toby Hoffman. \"Not doing anything wild or crazy but just having dinner or visiting friends. He's not kept in a cage. We've been out with women and he's been involved with a number of women. They are often a bit older than him because I think women of his age are not usually so developed and mature.\"</p> <p>Kissin now has homes in London (a flat in Victoria), and New York (an apartment on the Upper West Side within walking distance of the Lincoln Centre and Carnegie hall; former residents of the block have included Stravinsky, Mahler and Yehudi Menuhin).</p> <p>Kissin says he wouldn't get married for the sake of getting married but doesn't want to remain single all his life. It sounds as if the career comes first, but Marina Bower doesn't see it in quite those terms. \"First of all he is truthful to himself, and music is the major part of his life. He didn't choose it as a career. He does it because it is an urge and that's why at each concert he gives the utmost of himself without thinking of what effect it will have on his career.\"</p> <p>Gorgolione is genuinely proud about the way he has matured. personally and professionally. \"His only intention is to make the best music. The hype, the career, the adulation don't mean much. He is out there to face the bull, but the bull isn't the public, it's the music itself and he is there to serve the composer. He's probably the highest-paid pianist in the world, but the money and celebrity don't mean anything to him.\"</p> <p>Just before Christmas he played a benefit concert for a charity run by Charles Hamlen that raises funds for Aids research through classical concerts. \"He raised nearly $90,000,\" says Hamlen. \"It was a private house, albeit a glorious house, and he was playing to just 100 people, but he took it every bit as seriously as he would playing Carnegie Hall.\"</p> <p>It is this attitude that will see him through to the long term, contends Toby Hoffman. \"You occasionally hear people say that his music has never been as beautiful as when he was a child. I just don't think that's true. I hear a lot of development. A life in music is just that, a life. The great masters of the piano earn their reputations over 50 or 60 years. It's a continual exploration. There's no question that he's a genius. But he's a 28-year-old genius. As he matures as a person so will his understanding of the music. He understands what he wants to do and I can't see it getting anything but better.\"</p> <p>Some critics have noted a lack of emotionalism and occasional over-reliance of his phenomenal technique. His recording of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata didn't receive universal acclaim and Kissin has acknowledged that he was not happy with that recording. \"There is more to Beethoven's music than I managed to bring out,\" he said. \"I thought I'd brought it to a higher level in some of my recitals.\"</p> <p>He is duly respectful about the roll call of 20th-century greats with whom he has played. \"But while it is always a thrill to meet these great people, it is also a thrill to work on and perform great music. When that ceases the musician is finished. In our profession the feeling of awe is vital. It is something that cannot be faked.\" </p> <p><strong>Life at a glance: Evgeny Kissin </strong></p> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Moscow, October 10 1971. <strong> Education:</strong> Moscow Gnessin school of music for gifted children.

      "bodyText": "Just over a year ago, Evgeny Kissin was asked to name his closest friends. The 28-year-old Russian pianist paused for an agonising 15 seconds before mentioning two Russian conductors, both over twice his age and one of whom he hadn't seen for five years. The message was clear: \"Kissin inhabits a social incubator,\" the questioner confidently declared, \"untouched by human hand, immersed in his playing, unaware of his powers.\" The notion of the mature artistic genius but socially infantile human being is a seductive one, and looking at the bare facts of Kissin's life it is easy to see why it should so persistently attach itself to him. He was a remarkable child prodigy and has become one of the great musical talents of our age, yet he still lives and travels everywhere with his mother and teacher. His manner is, at least initially, extremely disconcerting, with the long pauses before answering questions and luxuriant Eraserhead hair-style only adding to the air of ethereal strangeness. \"He is partly on earth and partly somewhere else\", said Mark Zilberquit, the music critic and author of Russia's Great Modern Pianists. \"He was never a child prodigy, but a small genius. Now he is just a genius.\" Record companies and concert promoters have to an extent colluded in this supposed otherworldliness. \"His image wasn't the sort of thing that promoters would latch onto, like they would sex appeal or something like that,\" says Charles Hamlen, his former manager. \"But there is a kind of mystique to him and seeing that dissolve when he is at the piano is fascinating. Partly it is his total mastery of the instrument. Technically, he can do anything. But that is connected to something more spiritual. You have a sense that when he is making music, he produces on the piano exactly what he hears in his head.\" But while this portrait of the artist makes perfect sense in terms of pop psychology, the actual story is not quite so neat. Kissin had misunderstood the question about his friends, and was trying to name people the interviewer might have heard of. In fact, he has a loyal circle of what anyone would acknowledge as real friends. And they don't recognise the well-rehearsed caricature of him as a man-child savant. On meeting him, the preliminary sense of strangeness can soon wash away. He is surprisingly solidly built, tall, and has a deep voice at odds with his wan image. Toby Hoffman is a viola player who has known Kissin since he was 21. \"When we first met he was a bit shy and insulated by his family,\" says Hoffman. \"But that's not unusual for people who have a musical upbringing. People say it's not healthy that he lives with his family and his teacher, but in reality there is nothing unhealthy about the way he lives. \"When he needs to be on his own he is. It would have been more dangerous if he'd been thrown out to make a career on his own. When the time comes to leave his family, I'm sure he'll do it. He's very intelligent and he knows what he wants to do, and the way he has managed his life has meant his extraordinary talent has not been burned out.\" Kissin's virtuosity and musicality are the stuff of legend. In a world where child prodigies are nothing new, he was always something special. Aged two, he picked out his first tunes on a piano, at 10 made his performing debut with a professional orchestra, and at 11 gave his first recital. In 1984, when he was 12, in the great hall of the Moscow Conservatory he played both Chopin piano concertos, something not attempted since the turn of the century. And while the history of child prodigies is littered with the human wreckage of hopes unfulfilled and talent squandered, his career has been one of uninterrupted progression. At 17, he was asked by Herbert von Karajan to play Tchaikovsky's B flat minor concerto. The great conductor was so entranced by Kissin's performance that, it is said, at one point he forgot to cue in a flute. At the end of Kissin's 1990 Carnegie Hall debut, the conductor Zubin Mehta was so overwhelmed that, when Kissin leaned forward to shake his hand, Mehta grabbed his head and kissed it before virtually flinging the young pianist back at the near-hysterical audience. In 1997, he was the first pianist to give a solo recital at the Proms. He played to the biggest Proms audience ever (over 6,000), and rewarded them with the most-ever encores (seven). \"There are only a few individuals in an incredibly crowded marketplace at the moment who are both superb artists and have broken through to a wider public,\" says Nicholas Kenyon, the Proms director. \"Kissin is one of them. It's something to do with the fantastic concentration he puts into every note and the way he manages to sustain the arch of a piece from beginning to end. These people have to be cherished and we must hope that they are not led astray by that wider success. So far there is no sign whatsoever that Kissin has or will be.\" Amongst his peers he commands an awed respect. \"You see pianists all the time at his concerts,\" says Hamlen, who has now left the industry but remains in close contact with Kissin. \"There's no jealousy, they are just astonished by him. At the end of the Carnegie Hall debut his last encore was a Prokofiev toccata, which is an absolute finger buster. He played it like I'd play Chopsticks. The pianist Andr\u008e Watts, who was next to me, said the only appropriate reaction was to laugh. 'Otherwise I'd just have to go and jump off the George Washington Bridge.' It was astonishing.\" When the pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet, also a precocious young performer, first heard a tape of Kissin he was out driving. He recalls having to pull over, so moved was he by the performance. Kissin displays a mixture of embarrassment and critical prudence when discussing such matters as genius. \"It is a very powerful word. I take it to mean the highest degree of talent and it is often used to describe various other, very high, degrees of talent.\" When pushed to name musicians who qualify, he lists the pianists Carlos Kleiber and Sviatoslav Richter, the singer Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, and conductors Leonard Bernstein and von Karajan. \"Needless to say I would never ascribe it to myself and I am cautious about applying it to others,\" he adds. Very few people are cautious about applying it to him. From almost the very beginning he was identified as a remarkable child. He was born in 1971 in a Moscow hospital specialising in the care of mothers-to-be with heart problems. But the birth was straightforward And his mother, Emilia, has suffered no further heart trouble since. He has one sister, Alla, 10 years older than him, also a talented pianist. His father was an engineer. \"He had a secret job\", says Kissin, \"in a rocket factory.\" Igor Kissin was a Communist party member, but it seems to have been more a requirement of his job than out of overwhelming conviction, although he had the semi-official role of \"agitator\" at work - the person in each group who kept performance up to the mark. \"He used to receive a magazine called The Agitator to advise him how to do it\", says Kissin. \"We had piles of them in the toilet of our country house.\" The family dacha was more of a holiday chalet than a stately pile, with its outside toilet and cold water supply. It had been built by Kissin's grandparents in the 50s when Nikita Khrushchev, former premier of the Soviet Union, allowed small plots of land to be used to grow vegetables. Kissin spent whole summers there as a child. Although Emilia Kissin was a piano teacher, there was little other musical tradition in the family. Kissin has heard that one ancestor played the cello, and his maternal grandfather could also apparently play the mandolin, but there were never any professional musicians. So when the 11-month-old boy, who had been an abnormally quiet baby, suddenly sang the theme of the Bach A major fugue his sister had just been playing on the piano, \"my parents were astonished,\" he says. \"And from that moment on I stared singing everything. Classical, pop songs, anything I heard from the radio or was being played at home. When my parents would take me out I would sing in the street and passers-by would listen and give lots of advice. It is common in Russia to give advice,\" he adds with a smile, \"even to people you don't know and on subjects you know nothing about.\" When young Evgeny, known as Genya to family and friends, was two years and two months old - he is scrupulously accurate about this sort of thing - he was tall enough to reach the piano keyboard, and started to pick out tunes, first with one finger and then with all the rest. At six he was taken to Anna Pavlovna Kantor, a teacher at the Moscow Gnessin school of music for gifted children. Kissin recalls her listening to him playing and \"then she called a couple of other teachers over and I was accepted\". He didn't study in the same way as other pupils. He suffered from bouts of pneumonia in his first three years and the school established a \"free attendance\" regime for him which continued when he was well. Kantor, with no family of her own, has now essentially joined the Kissin family, travelling everywhere with Genya to provide him with \"consultations\", his preferred word to describe their work together. He remembers composing music in bed while he was ill, and that at seven he gave a concert of his own compositions. \"I began improvising as early as I began playing,\" he says. \"So as soon as I learned the notes I began to put music down on paper and whenever I learned something new I would use it for my own compositions.\" He continued composing until his mid teens, by which time he had tried all the different styles from classical through to modern and concluded that, \"I had nothing else to say\". His celebrity was travelling fast and he was a prize exhibit of the Soviet state music system. Kissin was featured on an English language radio programme and recalls his reaction to the huge post-bag it precipitated. One Swedish listener asked for information on his home. \"She asked about my nursery, the living rooms, my office and bedroom,\" he says. \"Everybody who read that letter and knew how I lived laughed. At that time me and my parents and my sister were living in a three room flat of 38 square metres. The living room was a bedroom for my parents and every night and every morning I had to move the furniture. We had a grand piano in my room but to avoid sleeping right next to the radiator I had to move my bed so that my head was under the piano. Then, when I got up, I had to move the furniture again in order to practise.\" The family moved soon after, to a larger home, but only after the head of the composers' union pulled some strings. While Genya's talent made his family eligible for such special treatment, they were still subject to persecution in other ways. As Jews, albeit non-practising, Kissin says they were subject both to systematic anti-Semitism as well as day-to-day indignities. \"My mother didn't get very far in her job,\" he says, \"although she was not very ambitious anyway. And my father, while he had a rather prestigious job, also encountered anti-Semitism. I have never encountered it at an official level but of course I have in daily life, since I was a small child. And it is especially frightening because it comes from other children of the same age.\" The family didn't observe any aspects of Jewish life, partly because they didn't know anything about it, he explains. Kissin says he is now interested in this heritage, but as much in terms of its cultural as religious aspects. He made his performing debut at 10 with Mozart's piano concerto K466, and gave his first solo recital at 11. Marina Bower first saw him play when he was 12. Some years later she became his agent in France and recalls that even then she instantly knew, \"I was in the presence of a phenomenon. It wasn't just a young boy, it was a unique personality.\" But it was when, aged 12, he performed the two Chopin concertos in the Moscow Conservatory with the Moscow State Philharmonic, that news of him spread outside Russia. Dan Gorgolione was working for CBS records in New York. \"Danny Barenboim had brought in this tape and a colleague played it to me. As I listened, tears were literally rolling down my cheeks, so I asked who was playing. I just couldn't believe when I was told it was some 12-year-old Russian boy.\" Similar scenes were being enacted in record company offices throughout the west, but access to Kissin was reserved for a very different set of cultural sponsors. Following the recital he was invited - \"it was not the sort of invitation one declines\" - to perform at the Kremlin to commemorate Lenin's birthday, a bizarre story. The piece he was instructed to play was repeatedly changed, once because it would be one minute too long. He had to play in front of a jury headed by the minister of culture, a chemist by profession, \"who approved of my playing but criticised the orchestra\". On the day of the performance, he was initially denied entrance to the Kremlin because he didn't have an internal passport (children were not issued with them) and then his mother and teacher - who had been placed in a side room with closed-circuit broadcast of the concert - couldn't hear the performance because a song and dance troupe played dominoes so loudly. When his teacher moved her chair closer to the television she was told that moving chairs was forbidden. At the end of the saga Kissin received a letter from an official expressing the hope that he would become a good citizen of the motherland. Last year, he received another special \"invitation\" and played at Prince Charles's 50th birthday party. Kissin says he has no recollection of things getting any more serious as he began to undertake more major engagements. \"Things were serious from the beginning, I was in a school that trained professional musicians.\" But he was increasingly aware of expectations. \"My teacher was always making me conscious of that to motivate me to work harder,\" he says. \"She kept telling me that the higher I was getting the more was being expected from me, and I had to fulfil those expectations.\" While this sounds like one of those horror stories in which gifted children are worked to the bone, in this case his mother and teacher were already beginning effectively to manage the pressures put on him. He only recently found out that the reason the family went to a small town outside Moscow for a few weeks following the Chopin recital was to protect him from \"all the fuss that would follow such a major debut\". His first appearances outside the Soviet Union were in 1985 when he performed in East Berlin and Budapest. He toured Japan in October 1986 and in 1987 made his debut in western Europe at the Berlin Festival. But the race to record him in the west was by now seriously underway. In December 1987 Dan Gorgolione heard that he would be playing in London the following May with the London Symphony Orchestra. \"So I booked the orchestra for the following day. I asked who the conductor of the concert was and I was told, 'some nobody'. It was Valery Gergiev.\" Because Kissin was under 18, his affairs were handled by the ministry of education in Moscow. Gorgolione sent telexes enquiring about recording him but received no reply. \"So there I was with an orchestra booked and no confirmation,\" he recalls. \"Then I saw he was playing in Madrid so I got on the plane and went. After the concert, which he played like God himself, I was taken backstage and introduced by a mutual friend. Genya pointed his finger right at my face and said, 'I make record for you'. Apparently the telexes had got through but they just hadn't bothered to reply.\" The recording, in Walthamstow, was of Rachmaninoff's second concerto. Kissin was nervous, it was his first studio recording, and they only had six hours studio time. It is usual to have twice that. \"But, to his enormous credit, Gergiev got him through\", says Gorgolione. \"He talked to him like he would to a baby brother and he nurtured him along.\" As Kissin's career increasingly spread westward he came under the wing of Charles Hamlen at the International Management Group agency. \"I first heard him play live in this empty, dilapidated ballroom in a hotel in Germany on a dilapidated baby grand piano. He completely brought to life the Liszt Spanish Rhapsody. It was one the most transfixing moments of my entire musical life. Then he did this incredible pastiche of everything from Bach to Mozart to ragtime, all running into each other. It was hilarious.\" By the time of his American debut in 1990 there was already a huge buzz about him in New York. He first played four concerts with the New York Philharmonic and then 10 days later sold out Carnegie Hall on the opening night of its centenary season. \"I remember people waving $100 bills begging for tickets,\" remembers Hamlen. \"You just knew from the first note that this was something you would talk about 50 years later.\" His triumph whipped up a New York media storm. Every television talk show wanted the young Russian genius but, as Dan Gorgolione recalls, Kissin had little idea what a talk show was and certainly no idea of how to play the game. \"He didn't know how to schmooze, and thought an interview was like an exam where he had to give correct answers. He went on Good Morning America and was charming but we turned down the Johnny Carson show; we didn't want to push our luck.\" Kissin left Russia in 1991, which meant he avoided conscription, and didn't return until 1997, when he was awarded the Triumph Prize, the highest cultural honour in the Russian republic. He shows little sentiment about the place but expresses some disappointment at political developments. \"I left at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, just after the failure of the communist coup.

It would give me more time to learn new repertoire, read books, perhaps to visit places I didn't have the opportunity to explore when touring. And to make new friends.\" He is godfather to Olivia Flatto's six year old daughter Julia. \"It's the best thing we did,\" says Flatto, who met him on a cultural cruise. \"He's a wonderful godfather. Both our children love him. He even sits at the piano with them and they play Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star. But their enthusiasm can sometimes be a little embarrassing. We have other friends who are musicians and Julia says things like 'you are a pianist, but you are not as good as my godfather'.\" \"I've been out with him until two and three in the morning in New York,\" reports Toby Hoffman. \"Not doing anything wild or crazy but just having dinner or visiting friends. He's not kept in a cage. We've been out with women and he's been involved with a number of women.

Kissin says he wouldn't get married for the sake of getting married but doesn't want to remain single all his life.

He understands what he wants to do and I can't see it getting anything but better.\" Some critics have noted a lack of emotionalism and occasional over-reliance of his phenomenal technique. His recording of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata didn't receive universal acclaim and Kissin has acknowledged that he was not happy with that recording. \"There is more to Beethoven's music than I managed to bring out,\" he said. \"I thought I'd brought it to a higher level in some of my recitals.\" He is duly respectful about the roll call of 20th-century greats with whom he has played. \"But while it is always a thrill to meet these great people, it is also a thrill to work on and perform great music. When that ceases the musician is finished. In our profession the feeling of awe is vital. It is something that cannot be faked.\" Life at a glance: Evgeny Kissin Born: Moscow, October 10 1971. Education: Moscow Gnessin school of music for gifted children. Ongoing work with Anna Pavlovna Kantor.

In a speech to the Association of British Credit Unions, Howard Davies, chairman of the FSA, said that depositors in credit unions would be offered the same protection as those in banks or building societies. In an attempt to boost credit unions, the government is giving the City regulator the power to regulate the mutual cooperatives, but while the government now meets 90% of the \u00a3500,000 yearly bill for regulation, the FSA will have to cover the cost from the bodies it regulates. However, the credit unions, of which there are 670 in Britain, are not expected to be able to cover this cost for some time. \"I am entirely prepared, on your behalf, to ask the banks, on whom the greater part of the burden would certainly fall, to support the cost of regulating credit unions, and I have a reasonable expectation they will be prepared to cooperate,\" Mr Davies said. \"But it is likely they will only do so if they can be satisfied that we are regulating in a cost-effective way and also if they are assure that credit unions are making reasonable efforts to comply with regulatory obligations in as efficient a way as possible.\" The FSA will issue a series of consultative documents in the coming months about its proposed regime for regulating the credit unions.

He's received a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for The Insider, in which he plays the real-life former tobacco company executive Jeffrey Wigand, whose testimony led to the first government sanctions against powerful cigarette manufacturers, and it's Crowe's performance as the beleaguered, compromised, noble and possibly mad whistle-blower that gives the film its troubling, fascinating soul.

There are many, many 50-year-old actors who are just marvellous, and I knew my co-star was going to be Al Pacino and you couldn't have a kind of paternal thing going on. They had to be peers, two men from different tribes trying really hard to get together and realising that it would be a lot easier if they really liked each other.

I operate in a fictional world where, if you make a decision about your character, you can rationalise it any way you want. I realised that this was a real man who suffered a massive emotional impact because of this series of events. This guy's life changed completely, as did his opinion of himself and his self-esteem. So I had a meeting with Jeffrey. I asked a lot of really hard questions and it was a very emotional conversation, but he answered every question straight, looking me dead in the eye.

From the autumn, Firstdirect.com customers will be able to access a \"wealth management store\" offering services such as sharedealing and a portfolio facility allowing them to track the performance of their shares and investment funds. These portfolio services are becoming very popular - personal finance websites such as Moneyextra (www.moneyextra.com) and Interactive Investor International (www.iii.co.uk) have signed up huge numbers of people to theirs.",

The only way institutions that currently offer free access to all Britain's cash machines could continue to do this is if they refund their customers every time they are \"fined\" by another bank - potentially a costly exercise. </p> <p>There seems to be little logic to the current highly confusing charging system with charges in one direction not matching those in the other. Royal Bank of Scotland, Nationwide building society, the Co-operative Bank and Bank of Scotland are among the big names that don't charge their own customers anything. However, things could obviously change dramatically under the planned new charging regime. </p> <p>Nationwide is one of the only players to indicate it may refund any charges that its customers face for using rival institutions' machines. However, it says that if the charges are set too high - say \u00a31 - this simply may not be viable.

What's more, since January 1, the \u00a316,000 has nearly doubled again, to hit just over \u00a330,000 this week. Yesterday, it was named the Proshare Most Successful Investment Club of the Year, beating the UK's other 6,000 clubs to notch up the biggest gain in 12 months. </p> <p>The club wasn't a one-off; 115 clubs earned their members more than 100% in gains during 1999, with five making 500% or more. </p> <p>Investing in high-technology and internet stocks was the key to Golden Eagle Nest's success. Formed in December 1998, the club's first investment was in Infobank, which specialises in e-commerce software. The stock was bought at 77p in January last year, but by December it had leapt to \u00a318.35. It hasn't stopped there. Infobank were this week trading at \u00a338 and the club believes there is more to come. </p> <p>Investment clubs work by a group of friends or work colleagues pooling together a small amount of money each month, typically \u00a325-\u00a350 each, to buy shares.

The clubs have soared in popularity, with the number doubling from 3,000 to 6,000 during 1999. </p> <p>Golden Eagle Nest was started by Garry Morgan, a technical supervisor at Ward Building Components, which produces cold-rolled metal components at a factory near Malton. \"I've seen people forming lottery clubs, but you'll never see that money again.

We also thought it had the potential to make a lot of money, so we were happy with it being high-risk. We thought we'd be lucky if it tripled in value.\" </p> <p>Halfway through the year the club diversified into something closer to home, a construction company called Breedon. But it failed to take off. The shares were sold and more money was put into Infobank, now at \u00a37 a share, plus another internet stock, Kewill. Bought at \u00a312.30, it rose to \u00a315.60 by the year end and is now trading at \u00a325. </p> <p>\"We are only thinking about taking profits because of tax considerations,\" says Mr Morgan. \"We still believe in Infobank. But at some point this year we hope to move back into a construction stock or a blue chip.\" </p> <p>One sign of the club's success is that another investment club started at the factory this week with 14 members. </p> <p>Golden Eagle Nest picked up a \u00a31,500 prize yesterday, awarded by Proshare chief executive Tony Hobman. \"The club has had an exceptional year and have done well by investing in technology stocks, but it is good to see that they now intend diversifying their portfolio by adding some shares from other market sectors,\" he says. </p> <p>The Cranham club from Gloucestershire also picked up a major award.

So it's no wonder there have been many calls for an end to the current system, where all those with a personal pension or who belong to a money purchase company scheme are forced to use most of their pension fund to buy an annuity. But the government fears if people can do whatever they want with their pension fund money, they'll squander it and then fall back on the state for support. </p> <p>The Retirement Income Working Party, a group of academics and representatives of pension companies, has been wrestling with this knotty problem and has come up with what it reckons is the solution. In a report published this week, it says that when people retire, they should not have to use all their pension pot to buy an annuity. </p> <p>Instead, an individual's only obligation should be to ensure an income that will keep him or her above state support for the rest of their life. The group says this \"minimum retirement income\" should be \u00a3140 a week. It would include the basic state pension, so if someone gets the full basic pension of \u00a366.70 a week currently, they would require another \u00a373.30 to hit the target. </p> <p>The group proposes that any shortfall would have to be met by the individual buying an index-linked annuity. So if the person only has the basic state pension, they would have to buy an annuity that would provide an income of just over \u00a370 a week - at current prices such an annuity would take around \u00a355,000 of a 65-year-old man's pension pot and \u00a362,000 of a 65-year-old woman's. But if they have other guaranteed income on top of the basic state pension, that will reduce the size of the annuity that has to be bought. </p> <p>Those people who can guarantee they have a regular income equating to \u00a3140-plus a week which will last for the rest of their life would escape having to buy an annuity. Someone getting the basic state pension plus, say, \u00a320 a week out of the state earnings-related pension (Serps), and who was also in a final salary pension scheme for a while, may find that all that adds up to \u00a3140 or even more. He or she wouldn't have to purchase an annuity because they would be judged to have met the minimum retirement income requirement. </p> <p>Meanwhile, many of the people who would have to buy an annuity will only have to use part of their pension pot to do so, and may well end up with quite a bit left over. The working party suggests that people should have \"the maximum freedom\" to invest the rest of their fund in a range of ways. An individual might wish to invest the money in something like a unit trust in order to provide them with a regular income plus capital growth. </p> <p>So how might all this work in practice? The report gives the example of John Smith, 65, who has worked all his life and has decided to retire. For a few years he was a member of a final salary company scheme. However, for quite a while he didn't have access to a company pension scheme, and so he paid into a personal pension. </p> <p>He has the following pension entitlements and assets: a basic state pension of \u00a33,471; a final salary company scheme entitlement of \u00a31,000 a year (not index-linked); and a personal pension plan with assets of \u00a3150,000. The minimum retirement income (MRI) target figure is \u00a37,280 a year (52 x \u00a3140). John can take up to 25% of the \u00a3150,000 in the personal pension plan as a tax-free lump sum - that's a maximum of \u00a337,500. He's decided to take the full amount. </p> <p>John begins by deducting the basic state pension from the MRI target figure. The amount left is \u00a33,809. The next stage is to consider any other pension entitlements. John's final salary company pension will provide a fixed income of \u00a31,000 a year. Suppose this is treated as equivalent to an index-linked income of \u00a3779. Take this away from the \u00a33,809 and that leaves \u00a33,030. As he doesn't have any other bits of pension knocking about, John must use some of the money in his personal pension plan to buy an annuity paying \u00a33,030. The current market price for this sort of annuity is \u00a345,866. </p> <p>Once you've knocked off the \u00a337,500 that John is taking as a lump sum, and then deducted the \u00a345,866, that means he's left with \u00a366,634 of the original \u00a3150,000, which he can then perhaps invest in a unit trust or similar vehicle.</p>",

Once you've knocked off the \u00a337,500 that John is taking as a lump sum, and then deducted the \u00a345,866, that means he's left with \u00a366,634 of the original \u00a3150,000, which he can then perhaps invest in a unit trust or similar vehicle.",
