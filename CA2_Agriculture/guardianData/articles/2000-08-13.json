We think we are doing something important every day. We're not. There is very little about an office job that matters in the great scheme of life, the universe, etc. And yet those of diminishing brain cells consider themselves to be genuine battlers. The mind is already locked into combat, so why not get the body out there doing it as well? We forget that most of business is just a giant, contrived role-play, and they confuse virtual battles and brawls - like take-overs - for the real thing. Hence all that working out in the gym for no apparent reason. Girding your physical loins for nothing more strenuous than sprinting to catch a tube or weigh-lifting a laptop. </p> <p>Repeat after me: Russell Crowe is an actor. And so is Brad Pitt. The adrenalin buzz you all claimed you got climbing into that ring the other day would have quickly turned into a bout of diarrhoea had you thought you were risking life and limb for real. Those of you who said you now knew how Lennox feels are patently stupid. He could get killed. Or at least an ear bitten off. You were just larking around.</p> <p><strong>Working women as warriors</strong></p> <p>Secondly, where do working women fit into this new cult of acted-out, new-age aggression? We are faced with three clear-cut options:</p> <p><br>\u0095 Sit it out and wait for it to go away. And it will eventually. For one thing there is the cost of dental bridgework to consider. </p> <p>\u0095 Join in. Tempting, I know. But only if we could field a team that could give the blokes a pasting. The point of the whole exercise at present is its butchness. </p> <p>\u0095 Cheer on. Remember the woman's role at the real events? Clad in satin knicks, carrying a card with the next round number on it high above your head while the blokes all whistle? We need very badly not to go there, not even for an ironic lark. </p> <p><strong>Passive- aggressive</strong></p> <p>The biggest threat to the status quo is the left-over pent-up, pumped-up aggression that will surely come back into the workplace itself. We've learnt over the years to settle things in assertive style. Aggression was bad. We did the course.</p> <p><strong>Fight clones</strong> It's okay for the pair that have been getting it off their chests in the ring, but what about the audience? We've all seen what happens at real fights or football matches. The goons turn copy-cat and start laying into one another. With all that unchecked testosterone are we in for a return to old-style business behaviours of conflict and bullying?</p> <p><strong>Steps to achieve fight back</strong></p> <p><br>\u0095 Encourage the choreographed punch-ups. Only insist that they don't become a preserve of white-collar and management. Sponsor Barry, the big bloke from packing. That should soon shut the rest of them up.</p> <p>\u0095 Learn the rules. Know more about the sport than the blokes do. That always puts them off.</p> <p>\u0095 Ask bosses whether the company can be sued if one of their employees either damages or gets damaged by another during one of the bouts.</p> <p>\u0095 Tell them you're arranging illegal bare-knuckle fights every Friday, for the real men to join in and prove themselves. </p> <p>That should see an end to it for good.</p>",

The adrenalin buzz you all claimed you got climbing into that ring the other day would have quickly turned into a bout of diarrhoea had you thought you were risking life and limb for real. Those of you who said you now knew how Lennox feels are patently stupid. He could get killed. Or at least an ear bitten off. You were just larking around. Working women as warriors Secondly, where do working women fit into this new cult of acted-out, new-age aggression? We are faced with three clear-cut options: \u0095 Sit it out and wait for it to go away. And it will eventually. For one thing there is the cost of dental bridgework to consider. \u0095 Join in. Tempting, I know. But only if we could field a team that could give the blokes a pasting. The point of the whole exercise at present is its butchness. \u0095 Cheer on. Remember the woman's role at the real events? Clad in satin knicks, carrying a card with the next round number on it high above your head while the blokes all whistle? We need very badly not to go there, not even for an ironic lark. Passive- aggressive The biggest threat to the status quo is the left-over pent-up, pumped-up aggression that will surely come back into the workplace itself. We've learnt over the years to settle things in assertive style. Aggression was bad. We did the course. Fight clones It's okay for the pair that have been getting it off their chests in the ring, but what about the audience? We've all seen what happens at real fights or football matches. The goons turn copy-cat and start laying into one another. With all that unchecked testosterone are we in for a return to old-style business behaviours of conflict and bullying? Steps to achieve fight back \u0095 Encourage the choreographed punch-ups. Only insist that they don't become a preserve of white-collar and management. Sponsor Barry, the big bloke from packing. That should soon shut the rest of them up. \u0095 Learn the rules. Know more about the sport than the blokes do. That always puts them off. \u0095 Ask bosses whether the company can be sued if one of their employees either damages or gets damaged by another during one of the bouts. \u0095 Tell them you're arranging illegal bare-knuckle fights every Friday, for the real men to join in and prove themselves. That should see an end to it for good.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>The big issue : Should we be getting in a funk about jazz?</b> <br> <p>While agreeing wholeheartedly with Cleo Laine's assertion that UK jazz is as good as any in the world (Review, last week) - one only has to hear Howard Riley, Mike and Kate Westbrook, or Andy Sheppard to be convinced of this - I feel she is wrong to lay some of the blame for its neglect at the feet of jazz journalists. </p> <p>As someone who has worked for three national newspapers as a jazz writer, I can assure her that it is arts editors, to a man and woman, entirely uninterested in jazz, who prevent their writers covering UK players, on the grounds that jazz is 'self-evidently' a US art form, and that readers will not be interested in the home-grown article. </p> <p>Incidentally, while working for the Daily Telegraph , I requested an interview with John Dankworth prior to a Generation Band Ronnie Scott's week, so that I could make many of the points Ms Laine makes. I was turned down, presumably because Mr Dankworth was too busy ensuring his band turned in a world-class performance. </p> <p><b>Chris Parker</b><br>London N8 </p> <p>Cleo Laine hit the nail on the head. It is regrettable that, when the Arts Council of England ratified their Jazz Policy in 1996, they failed to allocate explicit resources. Although much good has been achieved, far more would have been, and can still be, made possible with an increased and 'earmarked' budget. </p> <p>Despite the good intentions of the Jazz Policy, jazz - with the same size of audience as opera - received a subsidy of 0.15 pence per head in 1995/96 rising to 0.29 pence per head in 1996/97, falling to 0.25 pence per head in 1999/2000. </p> <p>While not wanting to rob Pavarotti to pay Courtney Pine, this discrepancy, where a subsidy per attender of opera of \u00a312.07 per head in 1995/96 is rising to \u00a312.75 per head in 1999/2000, cannot be justified and still requires urgent adjustment. Despite this underfunding, jazz continues its success story in the United Kingdom. In 1997/98 research commissioned by the Arts Council showed that the percentage of adults in the UK who attended jazz concerts was 5.7 per cent. In 1999/2000 research shows this has risen to 6 per cent. It does not take much nous to work out what even a modest increase in funding for jazz could achieve.</p> <p><b>Chris Hodgkins</b><br>Jazz Services<br>London WC2 </p> <p>Cleo Laine's lament for British jazz artists hits several false notes. Compared with, say, 40 years ago there are far more UK jazz festivals - Edinburgh, Coventry and Cleethorpes highlight 95 per cent home-grown talent.

      "bodyText": "The big issue : Should we be getting in a funk about jazz? While agreeing wholeheartedly with Cleo Laine's assertion that UK jazz is as good as any in the world (Review, last week) - one only has to hear Howard Riley, Mike and Kate Westbrook, or Andy Sheppard to be convinced of this - I feel she is wrong to lay some of the blame for its neglect at the feet of jazz journalists. As someone who has worked for three national newspapers as a jazz writer, I can assure her that it is arts editors, to a man and woman, entirely uninterested in jazz, who prevent their writers covering UK players, on the grounds that jazz is 'self-evidently' a US art form, and that readers will not be interested in the home-grown article. Incidentally, while working for the Daily Telegraph , I requested an interview with John Dankworth prior to a Generation Band Ronnie Scott's week, so that I could make many of the points Ms Laine makes. I was turned down, presumably because Mr Dankworth was too busy ensuring his band turned in a world-class performance. Chris Parker London N8 Cleo Laine hit the nail on the head. It is regrettable that, when the Arts Council of England ratified their Jazz Policy in 1996, they failed to allocate explicit resources. Although much good has been achieved, far more would have been, and can still be, made possible with an increased and 'earmarked' budget. Despite the good intentions of the Jazz Policy, jazz - with the same size of audience as opera - received a subsidy of 0.15 pence per head in 1995/96 rising to 0.29 pence per head in 1996/97, falling to 0.25 pence per head in 1999/2000. While not wanting to rob Pavarotti to pay Courtney Pine, this discrepancy, where a subsidy per attender of opera of \u00a312.07 per head in 1995/96 is rising to \u00a312.75 per head in 1999/2000, cannot be justified and still requires urgent adjustment. Despite this underfunding, jazz continues its success story in the United Kingdom. In 1997/98 research commissioned by the Arts Council showed that the percentage of adults in the UK who attended jazz concerts was 5.7 per cent. In 1999/2000 research shows this has risen to 6 per cent. It does not take much nous to work out what even a modest increase in funding for jazz could achieve. Chris Hodgkins Jazz Services London WC2 Cleo Laine's lament for British jazz artists hits several false notes. Compared with, say, 40 years ago there are far more UK jazz festivals - Edinburgh, Coventry and Cleethorpes highlight 95 per cent home-grown talent. Several independent record companies (Linn is a good example) promote British jazz. And this is not forgetting the array of venues, pubs and clubs (even the Wigmore Hall).

The best pieces have the suggestiveness and compression of short stories, although the collection feels padded out with instances of his journalism.

The early chapters are seen from the viewpoint of Helen, a headmistress, as she joins her mother and grandmother to nurse her brother, who is dying of Aids. The hesitant and difficult reconciliation is matched by the novel's progressive expansion beyond the confines of Helen's consciousness. In restrained and subdued prose, To\u00edb\u00edn conveys the claustrophobia and oppression of life in a small, conservative community: the rancour of unresolved, unspoken conflicts and the way families act both to sustain and damage the individual. It is an intense work, yet uncomfortable to read, partly because of the unlikeability of the principal characters. </p> <p> <strong> The Sword Cabinet</strong><br>Robert Edric<br>Anchor \u00a36.99, pp252<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502440638,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> </p> <p>The Sword Cabinet interweaves the tale of Mitchell - an illusionist and manager of a failed club in a seaside resort - with that of his father, an escapologist accused of murder in the 1950s: both are stories of deception and escape.

      "bodyText": "Grand Central Winter Lee Stringer Review \u00a36.99, pp250 Buy it at BOL Grand Central Winter is a collection of biographical pieces which trace the author's descent, as a result of crack addiction, from graphic designer to New York hobo, and his subsequent rehabilitation through the exhilaration of writing (he became an editor on New York's equivalent of the Big Issue). The book is impelled by outrage at a society which regards its derelicts as invisible; Stringer writes with satiric wit on strategies for survival in the urban wilderness and the economy of homelessness, and with pathos on its solitude. The best pieces have the suggestiveness and compression of short stories, although the collection feels padded out with instances of his journalism. His prose is tough and spare to the point of being mannered at times, but is capable of great lucidity and precision - particularly when he describes crack highs. The Blackwater Lightship Colm To\u00edb\u00edn Picador \u00a35.99, pp273 Buy it at BOL A serious and sombre study of relationships and social mores, Colm To\u00edb\u00edn's latest novel focuses on an estranged family in Ireland brought together by illness. The early chapters are seen from the viewpoint of Helen, a headmistress, as she joins her mother and grandmother to nurse her brother, who is dying of Aids. The hesitant and difficult reconciliation is matched by the novel's progressive expansion beyond the confines of Helen's consciousness. In restrained and subdued prose, To\u00edb\u00edn conveys the claustrophobia and oppression of life in a small, conservative community: the rancour of unresolved, unspoken conflicts and the way families act both to sustain and damage the individual. It is an intense work, yet uncomfortable to read, partly because of the unlikeability of the principal characters. The Sword Cabinet Robert Edric Anchor \u00a36.99, pp252 Buy it at BOL The Sword Cabinet interweaves the tale of Mitchell - an illusionist and manager of a failed club in a seaside resort - with that of his father, an escapologist accused of murder in the 1950s: both are stories of deception and escape. We follow Mitchell's attempts to reconstruct the past, then cut to the police interrogation of his father. We are left to assemble the story from a variety of partial sources; past events are filtered through hearsay and, further obscured by swaths of metaphor, remain mysterious. It is a study in seedy lives and disappointed hopes. Its distinctiveness lies in its evocation of the 'shabby-exotic' world of their ancestors: acrobats and magicians, fairground entertainers. The art of the illusionist is a recurring image and there is something of the magician's sleight of hand in the ostentatious skill with which Edric juggles the various strands.

      "body": "<p>The delicate, fine-boned woman in the silk Chanel blouse sitting quietly for her photographs in the elegant tea room of a London hotel is not at all what I expected. Naively, I had been picturing Sara Paretsky as her steely, fast-talking heroine, private investigator V. I. Warshawski; brash and tough, with fighting skills honed on the mean streets of Chicago's South Side. </p> <p>This soft-spoken, finely groomed woman with the neat, feathery hair doesn't look as if she often drops down empty lift shafts and flings herself on to the roof of moving trains, and of course there's no reason why she should, except that the detailed authenticity of her Warshawski books convince you that she must have lived at least some of it. But she shares with her character a determination and resilience that flashes sometimes in her quick eyes; like Warshawski - indeed, because of Warshawski - Paretsky knows what it's like to be a woman fighting her way through a man's world. </p> <p>Now that female detectives are almost de rigueur, and Paretsky's own books have over six million copies in print, it's difficult to imagine that only 20 years ago it was virtually unheard of for women to be writing hardboiled crime in the Raymond Chandler vein, and those who did were actively dissuaded from creating female protagonists.</p> <p>'If I hadn't been a crime fiction reader, I might never have tried to write for publication,' Paretsky says. 'Women didn't do that. But I got this bug that I wanted to have a woman detective, because I was so put off by the way women in crime fiction acted. Either they weren't there at all, or they would be total victims, or they'd be sexually active, so then you knew they were rotten to the core.' </p> <p>Paretsky has been working to fracture stereotypes of women since childhood. She grew up with her four brothers in rural Kansas, where her father was the first Jewish teacher to be hired by the university. 'We were like a family of giraffes,' she smiles. 'All the fundamentalist Christians wanted to come round and see if it was really true that we had little horns.'</p> <p>I ask if she felt isolated at school and she offers a little shrug. 'Sometimes, but not because of being Jewish - more because my parents were very contemptuous of ordinary social conventions.' Her parents were bookish and fond of music and Paretsky describes her mother as 'a phenomenal storyteller, much more inventive than I am,' which might have seemed an ideal environment to encourage an intelligent young woman. But after school, Paretsky encountered another glass ceiling to be broken through. </p> <p>'Although my parents were very progressive in their social and racial politics, they were very conservative in their sexual politics,' she says, slightly sadly but without bitterness. 'They had four boys to educate and they didn't think it was really worth educating girls, because they just get married and their education goes to waste. It was very hurtful at the time.' Instead of university, she was sent to secretarial school, but afterwards took a job as a dishwasher to fund herself through university; she went on to do a PhD in history and a master's in business. </p> <p>A summer of community service work in Chicago with deprived children ignited her obssession with the city that forms the backdrop to the Warshawski novels, and where Paretsky still lives with her husband. Warshawski came later, while Paretsky was working for a large insurance firm. </p> <p>'It was the fall of '78, and I was in a meeting with this guy who was really lethal and undermining all his subordinates - not just the women, he was evil to everyone who worked for him. And I suddenly thought, \"Here is my detective. She's a woman like me, but when she meets a guy like, I'll call him Fred, she doesn't worry about what to say. She's not afraid of getting fired or being nice, she just says whatever's in that balloon over her head, which we nice girls were brought up not to do\".' </p> <p>So she embarked on the first Warshawski novel, Indemnity Only, published in 1982. 'It took a long time to find a publisher - not only because I was a woman with a woman detective, but mainly because New York is so parochial, they thought no-one would read a novel about Chicago.' </p> <p>Paretsky is a woman with political ideals and a strong social conscience, unafraid to get her hands dirty with projects such as mentoring girls in inner-city schools or working with refugees. Her books tackle difficult issues, but she resists being described as a 'political' writer. 'Political fiction tends to be pretty dreary when it's trying to make a point. In a way I think my literary role model is Dickens,' she says, without a hint of self-consciousness, 'in that he was a great storyteller, but the stories came against the backdrop of the horrific social inequities that existed in London in the 1850s and that he had experienced first hand. </p> <p>'I think because it's always been such a struggle for me to find a voice and get people to listen to me, I am more focused on people who are voiceless. But storyline and characters absorb me much more than the political stuff.' Nevertheless, her tenth novel, Hard Time (Penguin \u00a35.99), its title a deliberate homage, has Warshawski confronting high-level corruption: abuses in the prison system, globalisation of the media, the exploitation of immigrant workers. </p> <p>'It really concerns me the way government is for sale these days, and the massive amounts of money companies can spend to buy the legislation they want. So if you don't have an independent press that is really diligent there's no way that abuses will be exposed or people called to account. So if your press is all owned by Hollywood studios, and these are the people who are giving a hundred million dollars a year to George Bush, then...' she spreads her hands out, indicating helplessness. </p> <p>If that makes the book sound worthy and heavy-going, fear not - she is quite right about story line taking precedence. Hard Time had me sitting up most of the night until I finished it. But it is a harrowing read in places, particularly in her exposure of the way women prisoners are treated. Although not allowed into women's prisons, she spent a lot of time talking to former prisoners and lawyers and there is a quiet anger and frustration in the book. </p> <p>'I felt angry, and I felt really powerless,' she says, with fierce eyes. 'The average age of a woman in an American prison is 20, 65 per cent are illiterate, 80 per cent are black or Hispanic. There's a tremendous amount of sexual assault and violence, and if the women complain they get put in solitary. It was hard for me to put V.I. behind bars because I like her to be in control, not to be that vulnerable where she got beaten up and nearly killed.' She pauses and looks thoughtful. 'I hope I never have to go to prison,' she says earnestly. 'I don't think I'd be strong enough, physically or mentally.' </p> <p>Perhaps not physically, but I would not doubt the strength of her mind. Paretsky is a fighter and you wouldn't want to be one of the bad guys.</p>",

In the case of Violet Bonham Carter, the answer is yes. You feel yourself in the presence of a great woman, a woman of wit and cultivated discourse, passionately devoted to the Liberal principles she inherited from her father, H.H. Asquith, Prime Minister from 1908 until 1916, and utterly loyal to her family and friends. </p> <p>Her liberalism was principled, certainly, but it was perhaps more truly dynastic. Fidelity to her beloved father's memory and reputation was the mainspring of her life. Indeed, he had only one rival - Winston Churchill, whose declining years are one of the central themes of the diaries, the last of three volumes. Her husband Maurice Bonham Carter ('Bongy') gave her domestic happiness but Churchill was in other senses the love of her life. An entry for 1967 records the answer she gave to Kenneth Harris when he asked her before a television interview 'if she had been in love with Winston'. </p> <p>'I had not been in love - though I could not have loved him more - &amp; - our relationship was an intimacy of minds - &amp; words &amp; an emotional one.' </p> <p>It is perfectly truthful as far as it goes, but these diaries were written with an eye to posterity and are not fully confessional (the editor, Mark Pottle, has removed passages which would be hurtful to those still living). As Churchill's daughter, Mary Soames, discloses in a perceptive and elegant introduction, Violet found some difficulty in accepting his marriage in 1908 to Clementine Hozier and was rather rude about her in letters and conversation. Eventually, they were reconciled and with good sense Clementine made no attempt to stand in the way of her friendship with her husband. </p> <p>The account of Churchill's twilight years is vivid and touching, but her affection makes her tolerant of his faults. He could be jealous of rivals and was unable to reciprocate Attlee's respect and liking, though his reluctance to hand over to Anthony Eden was fully justified by the botch his successor made of Suez. And this passionate opponent of racism and apartheid forgives her hero's racism as a minor blemish in a 'great tree' towering over all the rest in the political forest. </p> <p>The diaries are largely an account of an energetic public life in which her Liberal principles, uncontaminated by the exercise of power, burned with a kind of purity. With Churchill, she had opposed appeasement before the war; now with him she embraced the European movement and as the opportunities of boarding the European bus slipped by she lamented the loss of cohesion and pace. With him, she detested de Gaulle and the high tone of the diaries falters when she almost exults in his ill-health and imminent death. </p> <p>For all her devotion, she refused Churchill's repeated offers of an electoral pact, preferring a long electoral winter to the end of principle. For the Tories, Churchill apart, she entertained a genuine contempt. Instead, she poured her energies into helping her son-in-law, Jo Grimond, lead the party's hesitant revival that began with her son Mark's victory in the Torrington by-election of 1958. </p> <p>But the most important man in her life, until her death, remained her father. She was fiercely proud of his achievement, particularly in building the foundations of the welfare state, and scornfully dismissive of Lloyd George who supplanted him. And the diaries assume their only note of real personal distress, moments of personal bereavement apart, when she contemplates the proposed publication of 500 letters written by her infatuated father over three years from 1912 to her own close friend, Venetia Stanley (later Montagu). He abandoned the relationship after Venetia's marriage. </p> <p>Pottle deserves a special word - he is the Jeeves of editors, ever ready with a concise but helpful footnote, the master of the informative appendix. He edited the first two volumes with Mark Bonham Carter, who died in 1994, but was the sole midwife of the third. The result is once again a highly readable book, with narrative pace. </p> <p>For all her egalitarian and humanitarian principles, Violet Bonham Carter was a member of the old ruling caste, a toff.

Almost 30 years later, blues guitarist B.B. King, speaking to Rolling Stone magazine, snapped: 'Singing the blues is like being black.' </p> <p>In this authoritative and engaging study of race and class in popular music, Craig Werner makes the point from the very outset that rock'n'roll has its origins in the deep South, forged out of black misery and repression. </p> <p>Decade by decade, Werner translates the black experience, from Vietnam-era rage to the Clintonite race for commerciality. A Change Is Gonna Come, published to outstanding reviews in the United States last year, is almost as definitive as the examples he uses to illustrate his theory. </p> <p>The war in Vietnam perfectly highlights Werner's case. Edwin Starr's 'War' was the dominant soul response to the conflict. 'War? What is it good for? Absolutely nothing,' wrote Starr, incensed that black casualties on the front line accounted for 23 per cent of total losses, while African-Americans comprised only 12 per cent of the armed forces. </p> <p>Starr's response didn't entirely represent the African-American experience. In 1972, ageing jazzmen Eddie Harris and Les McCann launched a blistering attack on Starr's peacenik anthem. 'Compared to What' pounds out a jazz-funk groove that barely suppresses Harris's screaming condemnation of US politicians who could barely muster even the semblance of justification. 'Nobody gives us rhyme or reason/ Half a doubt and they call it treason.' </p> <p>Both records ignited a far-reaching debate within the African-American community. Yet an equally virulent rivalry was being played out elsewhere between Canadian songwriter Neil Young and southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd. Young set the feud in motion when he wrote 'Southern Man' and 'Alabama', denunciations of the racist South. Skynyrd replied with 'Sweet Home Alabama'. Both sets of performers have now been slugging it with thinly veiled insults for the past 30 years, but as Werner notes: 'Not many black folks care who won.' </p> <p>A Change Is Gonna Come, annotated with meticulous detail, maps the racial evolution of the American record industry, a strand of music theory where Werner comfortably holds his own against already established critics like Greil Marcus, Nelson George, David Toop and Peter Guralnick. The symbiotic relationship between big finance and rock'n'roll, however, is only hinted at and perhaps better explained elsewhere - Fred Goodman's The Mansion on the Hill: Dylan, Young, Geffen, Springsteen and the Head-On Collision of Rock and Commerce, a seminal 1997 study of rock'n'roll commerce, stands unchallenged.</p> <p>Werner's chapters on Springsteen, one of the rare occasions in the book when the author dissects a white icon, make for inspired reading. 'The Boss thing hung heavily over Springsteen's \"Born In The USA\" tour, and a lot of black folks who never heard the music saw the flag behind the stage, and in the hands of the white crowd in the film clips, and thought it must be the soundtrack for the next war.' </p> <p>Werner extends his argument by pointing out that throughout his Seventies' heyday, Springsteen regularly played three-hour shows that attracted a wide racial mix. Yet the standing joke during the 1984 tour was that there were more black people on stage than in the audience and 'the Boss' title, bestowed upon him by music critics, only succeeded in further alienating his black fan-base. </p> <p>Werner's analysis of rap, perhaps the most severely criticised of modern music forms, is especially readable. In 1992, Oakland-based rap artist Paris released 'Bush Kill', a vicious attack on the US presidency. The song was condemned and the artist was forced to leave his record label. Similarly, the lionisation of all-white icons, Elvis Presley in particular, has provided rap groups with indignatory anger. </p> <p>The chapters on rap are particularly well researched, even given the slew of releases over the last 20 years. Werner cites Living Colour as the best example of modern-day black militancy. The group, a three-piece rap/rock outfit, denounced Presley in 1988's 'Cult of Personality', a record that contradicted the popular view of the white boy from Tupelo as a subversive force. The same year, Public Enemy rapper Chuck D pronounced: 'Elvis was a hero to most/ But he never meant shit to me/ Straight up racist that sucker was/ Motherfuck him and John Wayne.' </p> <p>Almost 20 years ago, James Baldwin wrote: 'Our history is each other. That is our only guide. One thing is absolutely certain: one can repudiate, or despise, no one's history without repudiating and despising one's own.

There's a predictably interesting piece by Mike Marqusee. Predictably good because Marqusee is one of the very best sports writers in the country. Predictably less good because his tirade is directed against Murdoch et al. A fair target, but an obvious one, although Marqusee might argue that Murdoch, like Jeffrey Archer or Sir Tim Rice, is someone that you have to keep on knocking. And he's probably right. </p> <p>There is also a good piece by Simon Kuper, who argues that football can be the most effective means of showing dissent against a dictatorship. As an example of such dissidence, he writes about Helmut Klopfleisch, a Hertha BSC fan, and suggests there might be millions of football dissidents. That may actually be stretching it a bit. </p> <p>A good piece by Jim Firstle on drugs mentions the survey among Olympic athletes where an overwhelming majority said they would take a drug which guaranteed a gold medal even if it foreshortened their life. As Ben Johnson's coach, Charlie Francis, was forever saying: 'It ain't cheating if everybody else is doing it.' This is a classic variant on the 'Why me?' defence often advanced by the obviously guilty. </p> <p>Finally, there's a load of flannel from Gary Whannel (professor of media cultures at the University of Luton). In the course of asking 'What exactly is David Beckham?' he argues: 'In a culture that is self-referential, parodic and marked by the globalised circulation of images, the role of the sporting hero is inevitably subject to public demonstration.' Yawn. It's only a game, Gary.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This Sporting Lie Index on Censorship \u00a38.99, pp192 Buy it at BOL The latest issue of Index on Censorship turns its attention to the question of corruption in the world of sport. There's a predictably interesting piece by Mike Marqusee. Predictably good because Marqusee is one of the very best sports writers in the country. Predictably less good because his tirade is directed against Murdoch et al. A fair target, but an obvious one, although Marqusee might argue that Murdoch, like Jeffrey Archer or Sir Tim Rice, is someone that you have to keep on knocking. And he's probably right. There is also a good piece by Simon Kuper, who argues that football can be the most effective means of showing dissent against a dictatorship. As an example of such dissidence, he writes about Helmut Klopfleisch, a Hertha BSC fan, and suggests there might be millions of football dissidents. That may actually be stretching it a bit. A good piece by Jim Firstle on drugs mentions the survey among Olympic athletes where an overwhelming majority said they would take a drug which guaranteed a gold medal even if it foreshortened their life. As Ben Johnson's coach, Charlie Francis, was forever saying: 'It ain't cheating if everybody else is doing it.' This is a classic variant on the 'Why me?' defence often advanced by the obviously guilty. Finally, there's a load of flannel from Gary Whannel (professor of media cultures at the University of Luton). In the course of asking 'What exactly is David Beckham?' he argues: 'In a culture that is self-referential, parodic and marked by the globalised circulation of images, the role of the sporting hero is inevitably subject to public demonstration.' Yawn. It's only a game, Gary.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Dr Johnson's London </strong><br>Liza Picard<br>Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson \u00a320, pp373<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502426915,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Samuel Johnson, though not a Londoner by birth, was a shameless advocate of the social advantages of city life. 'They who are content to live in the country are fit for the country,' he tutted; and it was his avowed opinion that 'the full tide of human existence' was to be found at Charing Cross. </p> <p>In this new survey of Johnson's London, which spans the years 1740 to 1770, Liza Picard reveals what it was that proved so compelling about the monstrous metropolis. She explores its glamorous thoroughfares, tawdry avenues and fetid byways, and in the process develops a detailed picture of what it must have been like to live in the eighteenth-century capital. Anatomising the different worlds of the rich, the poor and 'the middling sort', she attempts, in particular, to describe the existence of those whose rituals and routines have been overlooked by scholarly history. </p> <p>Picard prefers primary sources to modern distillations. Her previous book, Restoration London, drew heavily on Pepys's diaries. Where the eighteenth century is concerned, there is no such obvious point d'appui, but the period's addiction to print means that there is a wealth of materials, and data have been culled from both the expected sources (newspapers, periodicals) and the unexpected - such as the journal of Per Kalm, a Swedish botanist who came to London in 1748. The result is a cocktail of lustrous details and intimate reflection. Johnson himself does not loom especially large, but each part opens with an appropriate quotation from his 1755 Dictionary, perhaps less as a guide than a goad. </p> <p>Johnson speaks of London's 'wonderful immensity'; but though the period was marked by affluence and an affluent indulgence of grand projects, it is clear that eighteenth-century London was a city still chiefly residential. It was ill-designed, insanitary and enveloped by a mantle of pollution. One critic complained of 'serpentine narrow Streets, close, dismal, long Lanes, stinking Allies, dark, gloomy Courts and suffocating Yards'. The highway was choked with dirt - or rather, 'a rich, glutinous mixture of animal manure, dead cats and dogs, ashes, straw, and human excrement'. </p> <p>The novelist Tobias Smollett, a Scot at sea in this torrent of ordure, was scarcely more impressed with the city's bread, which he considered 'a deleterious paste mixed up with chalk, alum and bone-ashes, insipid to the taste and destructive to the constitution'. Gin was frequently adulterated with turpentine, while fish were inflated in order to appear bigger (and fresher) than they really were. </p> <p>The London diet must have been a minefield for dyspeptics. A moderately prosperous family could consume up to 30lb of pepper in a year. Cods' heads, pigs' ears, larks on skewers, bottled peas, turtles, eels and snipe were all popular. There was even some affection for consuming turkey and apple pie - simultaneously. </p> <p>Yet health, it is clear, was much on Londoners' minds. Patients suffered while doctors grew rich. Many were prey to the allure of costly quackery, since hypochondria and complacency existed in curious sympathy. Cow dung fried in butter was known to be good for a sore breast; powdered roast mouse was thought a remedy for incontinence. False teeth could be obtained by post.</p> <p>Venereal disease, which was common on account of the inadequacy of contraceptives and the abundance of cheap prostitutes, was countered with heavy doses of mercury. The inefficacy of birth control procedures meant that coitus interruptus was widely practised: and this was casually known as 'making a coffee house of a woman's privities', since it required a man 'to go in and out and spend nothing'. </p> <p>The society Picard depicts seems riddled with an almost studious immorality. Pickpockets collaborated with itinerant ballad singers. Grave robbers and highwaymen rubbed shoulders. Beggars could hire children as theatrical props at the rate of fourpence a day. But their crimes were often brutally answered; those caught and found guilty could be subjected to mob vengeance, branding, public whipping, or a stint in the pillory. Worse, they could enter the Navy, which was permanently desperate for new recruits.</p> <p>The unpopular press gangs thought nothing of forcibly enlisting able-bodied males, and their notion of what it meant to be 'able-bodied' was distinctly flexible. On one occasion, observing that two large birds perched atop St Paul's Cathedral had drawn a crowd of sightseers, a notably enterprising gang placed a turkey on top of the monument in order to drum up a flock of potential conscripts.</p> <p>This was a society of unrepentant voyeurs and freak shows were therefore much in favour. In its first year, the British Museum received only 60 visitors, but the exhibition of a deformed child could pull in hordes. Visits to Bedlam to inspect the traits of insanity were still in vogue, and in April 1751 the Gentleman's Magazine was pleased to advertise the opportunity to view a centaur. </p> <p>Picard's account of such oddities is untouched by critical or political theory. But though at times old-fashioned, her book is in truth radically interested in satisfying simple questions about what London was like in its mid-eighteenth-century pomp. </p> <p>How did people live? What did they earn? What did they wear? The economics of daily life are mapped out closely. A penny bought enough gin to get drunk on; a shilling, a pound of Parmesan cheese; six shillings, a pound of opium; seven shillings, a dozen rabbits or a pair of strong shoes. A pound might buy a square yard of carpet, 12 French lessons, or a housemaid's services for two months. A prosperous tradesman's family could live on \u00a3350 a year, yet the lace on the Queen's state bed cost \u00a33,780 - in other words, enough for nearly a million people to get drunk. </p> <p>There emerges from Dr Johnson's London an impression of a society resolutely commercial and obsessed with commodities. Londoners were entranced by the sheer theatricality of their existence. Yet their world was larded with contradictions; self-watching and studied politesse were matched by visceral tastes and unabashed earthiness. With her keen eye for human quirks and human weakness, Picard brings the age's tortuous splendours and profound murkiness vividly to life, and does so with great verve and originality.</p>",

Where the eighteenth century is concerned, there is no such obvious point d'appui, but the period's addiction to print means that there is a wealth of materials, and data have been culled from both the expected sources (newspapers, periodicals) and the unexpected - such as the journal of Per Kalm, a Swedish botanist who came to London in 1748. The result is a cocktail of lustrous details and intimate reflection. Johnson himself does not loom especially large, but each part opens with an appropriate quotation from his 1755 Dictionary, perhaps less as a guide than a goad. Johnson speaks of London's 'wonderful immensity'; but though the period was marked by affluence and an affluent indulgence of grand projects, it is clear that eighteenth-century London was a city still chiefly residential. It was ill-designed, insanitary and enveloped by a mantle of pollution. One critic complained of 'serpentine narrow Streets, close, dismal, long Lanes, stinking Allies, dark, gloomy Courts and suffocating Yards'. The highway was choked with dirt - or rather, 'a rich, glutinous mixture of animal manure, dead cats and dogs, ashes, straw, and human excrement'. The novelist Tobias Smollett, a Scot at sea in this torrent of ordure, was scarcely more impressed with the city's bread, which he considered 'a deleterious paste mixed up with chalk, alum and bone-ashes, insipid to the taste and destructive to the constitution'. Gin was frequently adulterated with turpentine, while fish were inflated in order to appear bigger (and fresher) than they really were. The London diet must have been a minefield for dyspeptics. A moderately prosperous family could consume up to 30lb of pepper in a year. Cods' heads, pigs' ears, larks on skewers, bottled peas, turtles, eels and snipe were all popular. There was even some affection for consuming turkey and apple pie - simultaneously. Yet health, it is clear, was much on Londoners' minds. Patients suffered while doctors grew rich. Many were prey to the allure of costly quackery, since hypochondria and complacency existed in curious sympathy. Cow dung fried in butter was known to be good for a sore breast; powdered roast mouse was thought a remedy for incontinence. False teeth could be obtained by post. Venereal disease, which was common on account of the inadequacy of contraceptives and the abundance of cheap prostitutes, was countered with heavy doses of mercury. The inefficacy of birth control procedures meant that coitus interruptus was widely practised: and this was casually known as 'making a coffee house of a woman's privities', since it required a man 'to go in and out and spend nothing'. The society Picard depicts seems riddled with an almost studious immorality. Pickpockets collaborated with itinerant ballad singers. Grave robbers and highwaymen rubbed shoulders. Beggars could hire children as theatrical props at the rate of fourpence a day. But their crimes were often brutally answered; those caught and found guilty could be subjected to mob vengeance, branding, public whipping, or a stint in the pillory. Worse, they could enter the Navy, which was permanently desperate for new recruits. The unpopular press gangs thought nothing of forcibly enlisting able-bodied males, and their notion of what it meant to be 'able-bodied' was distinctly flexible. On one occasion, observing that two large birds perched atop St Paul's Cathedral had drawn a crowd of sightseers, a notably enterprising gang placed a turkey on top of the monument in order to drum up a flock of potential conscripts. This was a society of unrepentant voyeurs and freak shows were therefore much in favour. In its first year, the British Museum received only 60 visitors, but the exhibition of a deformed child could pull in hordes. Visits to Bedlam to inspect the traits of insanity were still in vogue, and in April 1751 the Gentleman's Magazine was pleased to advertise the opportunity to view a centaur. Picard's account of such oddities is untouched by critical or political theory. But though at times old-fashioned, her book is in truth radically interested in satisfying simple questions about what London was like in its mid-eighteenth-century pomp. How did people live? What did they earn? What did they wear? The economics of daily life are mapped out closely. A penny bought enough gin to get drunk on; a shilling, a pound of Parmesan cheese; six shillings, a pound of opium; seven shillings, a dozen rabbits or a pair of strong shoes. A pound might buy a square yard of carpet, 12 French lessons, or a housemaid's services for two months. A prosperous tradesman's family could live on \u00a3350 a year, yet the lace on the Queen's state bed cost \u00a33,780 - in other words, enough for nearly a million people to get drunk. There emerges from Dr Johnson's London an impression of a society resolutely commercial and obsessed with commodities. Londoners were entranced by the sheer theatricality of their existence. Yet their world was larded with contradictions; self-watching and studied politesse were matched by visceral tastes and unabashed earthiness. With her keen eye for human quirks and human weakness, Picard brings the age's tortuous splendours and profound murkiness vividly to life, and does so with great verve and originality.",

However, the home side took the lead against the run of play, and from that point they never looked back. </p> <p>As for Gazza, it was from his 47th-minute corner that the impressive Nyarko controlled Pembridge's shot before cheekily back-heeling the ball past Weaver to make it 3-0. </p> <p>Ipswich's star in their 1-1 draw against Fiorentina was their 19-year-old central defender, Titus Bramble. </p> <p>In addition to his outstanding defensive work, he delighted a crowd of 11,329 when he appeared at the far post to head home a free-kick from Jim Magilton after Jermaine Wright had been fouled just outside the penalty area in the 37th minute. </p> <p>Another Ipswich hero was England's number three goalkeeper, Richard Wright, who looked sharp and confident after settling his immediate future by signing a new two-year deal with the club. </p> <p>Coventry, without five first-choice players because of injury, established a 1-0 lead at home to Ajax through their Belgian striker Cedric Roussel, but ended up losing 3-1. </p> <p>Still, one encouraging thought for Coventry's manager, Gordon Strachan, is that only when he started giving his substitutes a taste of the action did Ajax put the ball in the net. </p> <p>Richard Witschge, who had dictated the midfield play, got the equaliser in the 65th minute when Tomas Galasek cut the ball back from the goalline. </p> <p>Then, in the 80th minute, substitute Brutil Hose scored within seconds of running on and the final goal was scored with the last kick of the match by another substitute, Cedric Van Der Gun.</p>",

Walter Smith's side proved too strong for the top-flight new boys as summer signings Niclas Alexandersson and Alex Nyarko engineered their downfall, with Paul Gascoigne on his Goodison Park debut turning in a pleasing cameo performance as a second-half substitute. Alexandersson put the home side two up before departing prematurely through injury and Nyarko added a third before Sean Wright-Phillips gave the scoreline some respectability for Joe Royle's men. The game was organised as a testimonial for former Everton midfielder Joe Parkinson, whose career was cut short by a knee injury, and while the Goodison favourite received a rapturous welcome from a crowd of 21,596 as he joined the fray for the last 14 minutes, this was as competitive a friendly as could be at this late stage of pre-season. Ironically, it was City who could have taken the game by the scruff of the neck in the early stages as former World Footballer of the Year George Weah led David Unsworth and David Weir a merry dance. However, the home side took the lead against the run of play, and from that point they never looked back. As for Gazza, it was from his 47th-minute corner that the impressive Nyarko controlled Pembridge's shot before cheekily back-heeling the ball past Weaver to make it 3-0. Ipswich's star in their 1-1 draw against Fiorentina was their 19-year-old central defender, Titus Bramble. In addition to his outstanding defensive work, he delighted a crowd of 11,329 when he appeared at the far post to head home a free-kick from Jim Magilton after Jermaine Wright had been fouled just outside the penalty area in the 37th minute. Another Ipswich hero was England's number three goalkeeper, Richard Wright, who looked sharp and confident after settling his immediate future by signing a new two-year deal with the club. Coventry, without five first-choice players because of injury, established a 1-0 lead at home to Ajax through their Belgian striker Cedric Roussel, but ended up losing 3-1. Still, one encouraging thought for Coventry's manager, Gordon Strachan, is that only when he started giving his substitutes a taste of the action did Ajax put the ball in the net. Richard Witschge, who had dictated the midfield play, got the equaliser in the 65th minute when Tomas Galasek cut the ball back from the goalline. Then, in the 80th minute, substitute Brutil Hose scored within seconds of running on and the final goal was scored with the last kick of the match by another substitute, Cedric Van Der Gun.",

      "body": "<p>Of the Premiership teams who yesterday warmed up for the start of their season with matches against high-profile foreign opposition, Ipswich produced arguably the best performance, against Fiorentina. At least they did not lose. </p> <p>On top of that, their 1-1 draw against the Italian Serie A side thrust another of their home-produced youngsters into the spotlight. The name is Titus Bramble, a 19-year-old central defender who prevented Ipswich going behind in the 23rd minute with a perfectly timed tackle on Paolo Vanoli and delighted the 11,329 crowd by heading the opening goal from a Jim Hamilton free-kick 14 minutes later. </p> <p>No less prominent was Ipswich's goalkeeper, Richard Wright, who pulled off three excellent saves.

      "bodyText": "Of the Premiership teams who yesterday warmed up for the start of their season with matches against high-profile foreign opposition, Ipswich produced arguably the best performance, against Fiorentina. At least they did not lose. On top of that, their 1-1 draw against the Italian Serie A side thrust another of their home-produced youngsters into the spotlight. The name is Titus Bramble, a 19-year-old central defender who prevented Ipswich going behind in the 23rd minute with a perfectly timed tackle on Paolo Vanoli and delighted the 11,329 crowd by heading the opening goal from a Jim Hamilton free-kick 14 minutes later. No less prominent was Ipswich's goalkeeper, Richard Wright, who pulled off three excellent saves. But even he could do nothing about Fiorentina's 47th-minute equaliser from Marco Rossi. Southampton went down 2-1 to Real Sociedad - through a controversial penalty - while Coventry were beaten 3-1 by Ajax. Although Coventry were without five first-choice players because of injury - Carlton Palmer, David Thompson, Marc Edworthy, Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo - they did manage to open the scoring through Cedric Rousel. The goal, after just six minutes, was something of a gift by the Ajax defence; and from that point Coventry found it difficult to get the ball, let alone create further chances. Still, one encouraging thought for their manager, Gordon Strachan, was that it was only when he started to give his substitutes a taste of the action that Ajax, who were also not slow to bring on fresh faces from the bench, were able to start getting the ball in the net. Robert Witschge, who had dominated the midfield, scored the equaliser in the 65th minute, and Ajax seized control in the last 10 minutes through Brutil Hose and Cedric Van Der Gun. While Ipswich were giving a reasonable account of themselves as new members of the Premiership elite, Manchester City - who seem the likeliest of the three promoted teams to hold their own at this level - suffered a 3-1 defeat at Everton. The game, organised as a testimonial for the former Everton midfielder Joe Parkinson and watched by a crowd of 21,596, was highlighted initially by the skills of City's former World Player of the Year George Weah. However, it was Everton who took the lead after four minutes, thanks to Niclas Alexandersson, and they never really looked back. In addition to Alexandersson and Alex Nyarko, who scored the other Everton goals, Paul Gascoigne also caught the eye with an exciting cameo performance as a substitute. Portsmouth are as good an outside bet as any to reach the Premiership this season, according to Barnsley's manager, Dave Bassett. However, as Portsmouth went down 2-0 at Sheffield United, it was just as well that he added: 'If I knew who was going to do what, I would be a millionaire with my feet up in Las Vegas.' Perhaps his own team are the best bet. Their defender Carl Regan, who was signed from Everton, was sent off on his debut against Norwich for a two-footed lunge on Daryl Sutch. But Barnsley, whose promotion dream last season was destroyed in the play-off final, went on to win 1-0 through a goal by another debutant, Lee Jones. Of the newly-promoted teams Preston, Peterborough and Kidderminster got off to perfect starts in their new environments with wins; Swansea, Northampton and Burnley had to settle for draws; and Gillingham and Rotherham lost. Gillingham went down 3-1 at home to Stockport, after being a goal ahead. It was even worse for Rotherham, who were 2-0 ahead against Walsall but crashed 3-2.",

      "body": "<p>Building a state is a monumental, precarious and rarely peaceful business. Even some states we now consider natural parts of the landscape are recent creations which have stood on the edge of disintegration within living memory. Losing the colonial war in Algeria nearly brought France to its knees. From South Korea to Argentina, Greece to Egypt, it's a similar story. The panoply of flags, rule of law, orderly changes of government, civil peace and relative economic stability are all recent and hard-won achievements. And although it is now lost in the sands of time, Britain, too, had its share of civil war, murder and division before the contemporary British state emerged at the end of the seventeenth century.</p> <p>It is in this context that Vladimir Putin, this week celebrating his first year in office as first Prime Minister and latterly as President, should be judged. In the West, Putin is now seen as the butcher of Chechnya, the ex-KGB stooge with a scant regard for democracy, liberty and market economics, whatever lip service he pays to its principles. As he appoints his old security friends to key Ministries and offices, we should be wary of another instinctive authoritarian rebuilding his power base in Russia. We should hold our noses and keep our distance. Putin is the next Pinochet.</p> <p>But has the West been misreading the Russian leader? Cast Putin as a state builder, the necessary if insufficient precondition to establishing a successful capitalism in Russia, and you start to see him in a different light. Moreover, he begins his endeavours from a disastrous starting point. Russia moved from a crumbling Tsarist structure to an authoritarian police state in one jump. After its collapse, there is no system of contract and property law; no impartial bureaucracy or judiciary; no common glue holding civil society together; little sense of governmental legitimacy.</p> <p>He is constructing a state on a site where the old, corrupt outgrowths of communism still flourish and in a country with more than 100 ethnic groups, some of whom, like the Chechens, do not accept any authority or legitimacy beyond their ethnic boundaries.</p> <p>The often forgotten advantage of communism was that, whatever its massive failings, it did offer a unifying ideology to a part of Euro-Asia otherwise riven by vicious ethnic hatreds. Tito, for example, never accepted the economistic interpretation of communism that implied no role for markets or private enterprise; he expressly ran Yugoslavia as a mixed economy. For him, communism was the perfect political doctrine for holding a fissile, ethnically divided community together; ethnic cleansing was ideologically outlawed.</p> <p>Many professional middle-class Russians took the same view about the Soviet Union. At least communism kept the ethnic menace at bay and could hold the country together effectively. The endless parades in 1945, piling up German battle standards in Red Square, were a self-conscious repetition of what Tsar Alexander had done after victory over Napoleon, propagandising communism's effectiveness as a substitute for an orthodox state.</p> <p>The events of the last decade amply justify the fears about Russia's governability. The small army of ideological free-market economists who argued that the sole preconditions for a successful capitalism were private property and flexible prices were not simply economically na\u00efve, they were political innocents who had forgotten their history. Of course, in the absence of a strong centre and no cultural, ethnic or political reason to be loyal to Moscow, the governors in Russia's cities, provinces and federal regions would spend money like water to keep their restless, poverty-stricken and ethnically diverse populations happy without collecting taxes, the heart of the still massive government budget deficit and proximate cause of the high and volatile inflation rate.</p> <p>And, of course, capitalism in a state that could not offer even relative price stability, impartial justice, trustworthy banks and the rule of law would quickly collapse into quasi-banditry. Add the ghastly economic legacy of communism, with its massive inefficiencies, and the whole cocktail was likely to deliver what it has - economic collapse and a vacuum of political authority on a titanic scale. On one calculation, 80 per cent of businesses and 60 per cent of the state are said to be corrupt; even those figures could be an underestimate. In this respect, the infamous 'oligarchs', the Mafia-style bosses who dominate Russia's business through gangsterism, are as much the symptom as the cause of Russia's ills.</p> <p>Putin not only understands all this, he says so openly and is acting to correct it. His state-of-the-nation address to the Duma last month was astonishingly frank. The Russian government and state processes are the principal causes of 'raging corruption', the outflow of capital and the 'dictatorship of the black economy', he said. What was impeding economic growth were the twin enemies of criminal business and corrupt officialdom. Yet there was no going back to a command economy and communism. The only way forward was capitalism, but, paradoxically, that required strong political authority at the centre, an authority that would be strengthened rather than weakened by free media scrutiny, the rule of law, democratic competition and impartial administration.

      "bodyText": "Building a state is a monumental, precarious and rarely peaceful business. Even some states we now consider natural parts of the landscape are recent creations which have stood on the edge of disintegration within living memory. Losing the colonial war in Algeria nearly brought France to its knees. From South Korea to Argentina, Greece to Egypt, it's a similar story. The panoply of flags, rule of law, orderly changes of government, civil peace and relative economic stability are all recent and hard-won achievements. And although it is now lost in the sands of time, Britain, too, had its share of civil war, murder and division before the contemporary British state emerged at the end of the seventeenth century. It is in this context that Vladimir Putin, this week celebrating his first year in office as first Prime Minister and latterly as President, should be judged. In the West, Putin is now seen as the butcher of Chechnya, the ex-KGB stooge with a scant regard for democracy, liberty and market economics, whatever lip service he pays to its principles. As he appoints his old security friends to key Ministries and offices, we should be wary of another instinctive authoritarian rebuilding his power base in Russia. We should hold our noses and keep our distance. Putin is the next Pinochet. But has the West been misreading the Russian leader? Cast Putin as a state builder, the necessary if insufficient precondition to establishing a successful capitalism in Russia, and you start to see him in a different light. Moreover, he begins his endeavours from a disastrous starting point. Russia moved from a crumbling Tsarist structure to an authoritarian police state in one jump. After its collapse, there is no system of contract and property law; no impartial bureaucracy or judiciary; no common glue holding civil society together; little sense of governmental legitimacy. He is constructing a state on a site where the old, corrupt outgrowths of communism still flourish and in a country with more than 100 ethnic groups, some of whom, like the Chechens, do not accept any authority or legitimacy beyond their ethnic boundaries. The often forgotten advantage of communism was that, whatever its massive failings, it did offer a unifying ideology to a part of Euro-Asia otherwise riven by vicious ethnic hatreds. Tito, for example, never accepted the economistic interpretation of communism that implied no role for markets or private enterprise; he expressly ran Yugoslavia as a mixed economy. For him, communism was the perfect political doctrine for holding a fissile, ethnically divided community together; ethnic cleansing was ideologically outlawed. Many professional middle-class Russians took the same view about the Soviet Union. At least communism kept the ethnic menace at bay and could hold the country together effectively. The endless parades in 1945, piling up German battle standards in Red Square, were a self-conscious repetition of what Tsar Alexander had done after victory over Napoleon, propagandising communism's effectiveness as a substitute for an orthodox state. The events of the last decade amply justify the fears about Russia's governability. The small army of ideological free-market economists who argued that the sole preconditions for a successful capitalism were private property and flexible prices were not simply economically na\u00efve, they were political innocents who had forgotten their history. Of course, in the absence of a strong centre and no cultural, ethnic or political reason to be loyal to Moscow, the governors in Russia's cities, provinces and federal regions would spend money like water to keep their restless, poverty-stricken and ethnically diverse populations happy without collecting taxes, the heart of the still massive government budget deficit and proximate cause of the high and volatile inflation rate. And, of course, capitalism in a state that could not offer even relative price stability, impartial justice, trustworthy banks and the rule of law would quickly collapse into quasi-banditry. Add the ghastly economic legacy of communism, with its massive inefficiencies, and the whole cocktail was likely to deliver what it has - economic collapse and a vacuum of political authority on a titanic scale. On one calculation, 80 per cent of businesses and 60 per cent of the state are said to be corrupt; even those figures could be an underestimate. In this respect, the infamous 'oligarchs', the Mafia-style bosses who dominate Russia's business through gangsterism, are as much the symptom as the cause of Russia's ills. Putin not only understands all this, he says so openly and is acting to correct it. His state-of-the-nation address to the Duma last month was astonishingly frank. The Russian government and state processes are the principal causes of 'raging corruption', the outflow of capital and the 'dictatorship of the black economy', he said. What was impeding economic growth were the twin enemies of criminal business and corrupt officialdom. Yet there was no going back to a command economy and communism. The only way forward was capitalism, but, paradoxically, that required strong political authority at the centre, an authority that would be strengthened rather than weakened by free media scrutiny, the rule of law, democratic competition and impartial administration. Who can disagree? Putin is acting extraordinarily bravely in the circumstances. He has appointed seven federal super-governors charged with curbing the autonomy and spending of 89 provincial and regional political bosses. This is not just a political but an economic necessity as their spending now constitutes 40 per cent of all public spending. On top, he has insisted that all taxes should be collected centrally, a privilege which the regional governors guarded jealously against all Yeltsin's efforts but which they have now ceded to Putin. No concession at this juncture on autonomy was ever possible to the Chechens; it would have undermined the entire effort to re-engineer the Russian state.

But the new Gore-Lieberman brand has yet to be tested. And the first big test is whether it will fall into the trap the Republicans have set for it this week in Los Angeles.</p> <p>Gore's choice of Lieberman was smart on three grounds. First, the chutzpah of picking an orthodox Jew grabbed the political momentum away from George W. Bush right after Bush's perfectly-scripted Republican convention, thereby checking Bush's convention 'bounce' in the polls. Second, given Lieberman's concern about moral values in America and his outspoken criticism of President Clinton's liaison with Monica Lewinsky, the pick gives Gore some protection against Republican attempts to tar him with Clinton's turpitude. Finally, Lieberman is a conservative Democrat, which helps Gore with the same moderate swing-voters Bush is trying to court.</p> <p>But these advantages won't carry Gore far. Lieberman may be 'the conscience of the Senate', as one enthusiastic Democrat put it, but until last week most Americans had never heard of him. Senators are little known outside the states they represent and Lieberman is no exception.</p> <p>There's also the question of latent anti-Semitism in America.

The Democratic party is a larger tent than the Republican one - including labour unions, environmentalists, libertarians, African-Americans, Jews, old lefties, so-called New Democrats, trial lawyers, and civil servants - and not all these groups get on with the others. After eight years of the Clinton administration, moreover, some of them are outright disappointed. Rank-and-file union members are upset with Gore on his pro-trade stance, for example, and some of them will be on the convention floor talking to reporters.</p> <p>Plus, there's the complication of two other national Democratic campaigns competing with Gore's - Hillary Clinton's, for the US Senate from New York, which is drawing off donations and media attention; and Bill Clinton's for his place in history, which also needs money (for a presidential library and related accoutrements) and attention (to what he has accomplished in office). Also, count on bigger and more disruptive demonstrations outside the convention hall than occurred in Philadelphia. Los Angeles is easier to get to than Philadelphia, California is flakier than Pennsylvania and Democrats always attract more demonstrators.</p> <p>But the biggest trap has been laid by the Republicans, whose own convention embodied all the traditional images of a Democratic one - a kaleidoscope of ethnic groups; an address by the sole avowedly gay Republican member of Congress; the gentle rhetoric of tolerance and inclusion; the suggestion of policies that will help children become better educated, help working families afford health insurance and ensure that social security will be saved.</p> <p>Democrats are eager to reveal the hypocrisy at the heart of the Republican strategy. Who are these Republicans to adopt Democratic images and themes when for the last eight years the Republicans have gone out of their way to thwart Democratic goals? How dare they speak as if they're responsible for the good times when the Clinton-Gore administration inherited a $300 billion deficit?

They're also bored to tears with it.

Since the adoption of the Kyoto protocol in 1997, when major countries agreed to work toward reducing CO &lt;-&gt;2 emissions, US policy has been held hostage by special interests, particularly those in the oil industry. Now, all major presidential runners have made the giant step of accepting the truth of global warming. This provides an opportunity. The next global-warming conference will be held in the Hague in November. The US is set to propose that the Kyoto targets should be amended to include the notion of 'carbon sinks'. Countries which demonstrate improved crop land and forest management (which can absorb carbon dioxide) would be given carbon credits to trade against their emissions. In other words, the pressure would be off industry to reduce CO &lt;-&gt;2 emissions. It is an ingenious idea but deeply flawed, self-evidently so now that so much of US forest land is burning. The weather events in this infant millennium alone are sufficient to declare a global emergency. The US should treat it as such and take unequivocal action in the Hague to adopt the Kyoto targets.",

It has asked Western governments to declare its air space a 'no-fly zone' and to increase significantly the Nato naval presence in the Adriatic Sea. A 'no-fly zone' patrolled by Nato warplanes would prevent the Yugoslav Air Force from taking offensive action in the republic in the event of a conflict. During Nato's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia last year, warplanes used aircraft carriers in the Adriatic and cruise missiles were launched from Western naval vessels. A renewed naval presence off Montenegro would also leave the Yugoslav military guessing as to whether any military landing would follow a request for help from the Montenegrin government. A Montenegrin minister, who asked not to be named, confirmed that 'messages had been sent' to Western governments requesting the 'no-fly zone' but added that there was no agreement on how 'it is defined'. Relations between Montenegro and the Yugoslav authorities took a significant turn for the worse last month, when Milosevic rammed through constitutional changes without consulting Montenegro.

He is one of 20,000 civilians fighting what experts agree are the worst forest fires in the US for the past 10 years, if not since 1949. Nearly a million acres are ablaze in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Texas, Washington and Wyoming.

Below him, in Rabbit Creek, the two teams of Alaskan hotshots he works with have just pulled out of a fire that the winds had whipped down the valley. Dier is roaming the area, looking for information about the fire that might help his crews. Hotshots try to contain fires by chainsawing down unburnt trees and digging ditches across their path. Their shifts can last up to 30 hours. The work is perilous: a change in the wind direction can leave a team stranded, with only the thin, flame- retardant canopies they carry with them for protection.</p> <p>But these are ordinary men, many with ordinary jobs to go back to. Fourteen years ago, Dier spent his days fixing Harley-Davidsons. Then he became a hotshot and found full-time work in the US Forestry Service in San Bernardino, California.</p> <p>'I've been on my toes here' he says. 'It's slow going. In the desert terrain of San Bernardino you can see above the brush, but not here. With the cloud cover and smoke, our satellite positioning equipment is no use, as we can't get a signal. Also, the smoke is sinking, so it's unhealthy to stay around there. We may never get a handle on this one. For now we have to keep it away from people's homes'.</p> <p>Rabbit Creek is one of a host of problematic areas around Burgdorf Junction, north of the small lake town of McCall. On 14 July lightning struck and so far, across Idaho, 15 fires have set 408,000 acres ablaze. Burgdorf's 25,000-acre fire is small compared with the nation's largest blaze of 192,450 acres in nearby Clear Creek, or the Sula and Valley Complex fires in neighbouring Montana. But it has required the largest number of personnel to tackle it, even attracting the attention of President Clinton who diverted his helicopter last week to visit the teams and pledge an extra $150 million of federal money to aid the fight.</p> <p>Burgdorf's fires refuse to stay extinguished: the heat the conifers generate as they burn remains in the ground and ashes for days and can easily reignite. At present, the ignition rate is 90 per cent - for every hundred sparks that fly, 90 will start another fire.</p> <p>The counter-measures are slow. Blackhawk helicopters drop 3,000-gallon water bombs on the blaze, which erupt in angry clouds of steam. A few miles west, in Schissler Creek, a team from C Company, from the US Army's 3rd Battalion, are 'mopping up'. Following a dangerous 1,300ft steep descent from the road to the ravine below, the infantry slowly move across the valley, dousing embers with water piped from the rivers, felling hazardous trees and extinguishing ashes.

Based 150 miles away in Bosie, his team have been tackling blazes all over the country but cannot find the resources to help in Idaho. Jumpers parachute into the source of a blaze and then do the job of hotshots.</p> <p>Tupper spent a year as a real estate agent, before enlisting. 'Ninety-eight per cent of fires we jump, we catch within 24 hours,' he declares. 'We're valued for the speed and range of the aircraft that take us to a fire, and the payload we can deliver of eight jumpers per plane.'</p> <p>Tupper says he has never felt in danger. 'What I fear most is driving to work on my bike,' he grins, before enthusing about a jump he did in Alaska. His team were cut off in a valley by a wall of flame and had to beat a hole through it to escape.</p> <p>The Idaho fires are already too well established for the preventative measures of jumpers. Rex Crabtree, a US Forestry official from California with 26 years' experience, commands a team of firefighters in one valley here and refers to these burnt areas as having been 'nuked'.</p> <p>But he says that fire is a natural part of the forest eco-system. 'Hundreds of years ago, the Pioneers used to talk about the air here being foggy,' he says, referring to when fires were not contained by controlled burns, but allowed to follow their natural course and smoulder at a low intensity for much of the year. 'But today some areas have not seen fire for years, so dead and alive foliage builds up'. When the flames hit these areas, they burn intensely, causing the huge fires that blight the area today.</p> <p>Across the nation, the problem grows. Fourteen hundred people have been asked to leave their homes. Highways across the country have been shut and six million acres of Montana woodland have been closed to the public. Power lines running from Montana to the Pacific West have been cut.</p> <p>In previous years, the fires have died down in some areas before they ignited in others, easing the strain on man power. This year, the National Interagency Fire Centre says, the fires are happening everywhere simultaneously.</p> <p>At the end of a fierce day, Crabtree stands above Schissler Creek and surveys the endless plumes of smoke below. Over the rise, an area of flames is expanding quickly. Behind him on an adjacent hill, a fire has broken out in an area of wild forest. Within 15 minutes a vast cloud of smoke has filled the sky over the hill. As Crabtree turns around and heads back to the trucks, the grey lining on the horizon makes it clear why many experts think the fires will only stop with the arrival of the winter snow.</p>",

Highways across the country have been shut and six million acres of Montana woodland have been closed to the public. Power lines running from Montana to the Pacific West have been cut. In previous years, the fires have died down in some areas before they ignited in others, easing the strain on man power. This year, the National Interagency Fire Centre says, the fires are happening everywhere simultaneously. At the end of a fierce day, Crabtree stands above Schissler Creek and surveys the endless plumes of smoke below. Over the rise, an area of flames is expanding quickly. Behind him on an adjacent hill, a fire has broken out in an area of wild forest. Within 15 minutes a vast cloud of smoke has filled the sky over the hill. As Crabtree turns around and heads back to the trucks, the grey lining on the horizon makes it clear why many experts think the fires will only stop with the arrival of the winter snow.",

The lack of a dominant godfather figure means rival factions are fighting to fill the power vacuum, and police fear the violence may escalate further.</p> <p>Although he has been dead for nearly eight years, the name of Arthur Thompson still induces instant amnesia or muteness in Provanmill residents. 'You're wasting your time,' a shopkeeper said. 'No one is going to say anything about him or the rest of the family.'</p> <p>Arthur was an enforcer in Scotland for the Krays during the late Fifties, and by the mid-Sixties had established a chain of pubs and dance halls, popular haunts for gangsters. Friendly with the likes of 'Mad' Frankie Fraser and Billy Hill, he was a leading underworld figure north of the border.</p> <p>In 1966 he escaped death when a bomb exploded in his MG sports car, but his mother-in-law, in the passenger seat, was killed. Arthur suspected that two men from the rival Welsh clan, Patrick Welsh and James Goldie, had planted the bomb. Some time afterwards he spotted them in their van. He drove his Jaguar straight at the van, forcing it off the road and into a lamppost, killing Welsh and Goldie. Arthur was charged with their murders, but he was set free because no witnesses came forward to testify. The incident was part of a long feud between the two clans. In 1969 Thompson's wife, Rita, forced her way into the Welsh home, stabbed Patrick Welsh's wife in the chest, and was jailed for three years.</p> <p>By the Eighties, the Thompson clan had moved into the drug trade led by the Thompsons' eldest son, Arthur Jnr, known as Fat Boy, who operated out of Blackpool. As money rolled in, they converted their council home into a palace, buying the property next door and knocking the two together. This luxury fortress was known as 'The Ponderosa'.</p> <p>Disaster struck in 1985 when Fat Boy was jailed for 11 years when he fell victim to a huge heroin bust. His team, the Barlanark Gang, initially continued paying him a cut, but the two sides quickly fell out as the Gang found new paymasters.</p> <p>The jailing of Fat Boy brought challenges from gangs hoping to take over the Thompson empire. In 1988 Arthur was shot in the groin outside The Ponderosa. He booked himself into a private clinic and told the police the injury had been caused by a drill bit which broke off.</p> <p>Three years later, a car mounted the pavement outside his home and ran him over. Again, Arthur survived and refused to make any statement to the police. In 1989, Arthur's daughter, Margaret, died of a drugs overdose. Two years later Fat Boy was gunned down outside The Ponderosa just six hours after coming home from prison on weekend leave. He died in his father's arms.</p> <p>A few hours before Fat Boy's funeral, the bodies of local hardmen Bobby Glover and Joe 'Bananas' Hanlon, widely thought to be responsible for Fat Boy's death, were found outside a bar in east Glasgow. They had each been shot in the back of the head, with an extra bullet fired up their anuses for good measure. Another local hard man, Paul Ferris, was charged with Fat Boy's murder, but cleared after Scotland's longest criminal trial. He has since been jailed for involvement in a firearms conspiracy.</p> <p>The spot where Fat Boy died is just a few yards from where Billy Thompson was stabbed 10 months ago during the unsuccessful first attempt on his life and a short distance from the site of the most recent attack. Arthur Thompson Snr died of a heart attack in 1993. His death, coupled with the jailing of Paul Ferris on firearms charges in 1999, left a void which has generated a wave of violence.</p> <p>In May, veteran gangland boss Frank McPhee was shot through the head on his doorstep, as his 11-year-old son looked on in terror. Police have run up against a wall of silence, but believe the murder is linked to drugs.</p> <p>One theory is that McPhee had tried to muscle in on the drug trade controlled by former Irish terrorists. He had been a regular visitor to Northern Ireland. A sniper waited for him after he had been chased through Glasgow by another hitman. He had been responsible for negotiating between dealers in the North and the rest of England. He was killed by a single shot from a high-powered .22 rifle.</p> <p>One detective on the case said: 'He had been a dead man walking for years. For McPhee, the end was always going to come like this.' Police are probing his links with a big dogfighting ring.</p> <p>The battle for Glasgow's underworld is being further complicated by the arrival of a new clan of Triad gangsters attempting to take over the drug trade. Earlier this year, pitched battles broke out in Chinese restaurants between the Wo Sing Wo Triad and their rivals, the Tai Huen Chair or Big Circle Gang.</p> <p>Another underworld figure vying for control is a 65-year-old Scot, Billy Blackledge, who has been on the run from the FBI for 10 years for his involvement in a \u00a310 million drugs deal involving Hell's Angels from Canada. He is said to run his empire from a luxury yacht.</p> <p>According to underworld sources, Billy Thompson, who has served a number of prison sentences and has a heroin habit, wanted to regain the former prominence of the Thompson name, despite the fact that he has not inherited any of his father's business acumen.</p> <p>He was jailed three years ago for carrying a knife and, a week after his release, was jailed again for carrying a harpoon gun. On both occasions, he told police that he feared for his life.</p> <p>Billy Thompson has now been taken off the critical list and looks set to make a full recovery. But the damage to his family's already tattered reputation, not to mention the violent implications for Glasgow's underworld, look set to last for some time to come.</p>",

Arthur was an enforcer in Scotland for the Krays during the late Fifties, and by the mid-Sixties had established a chain of pubs and dance halls, popular haunts for gangsters. Friendly with the likes of 'Mad' Frankie Fraser and Billy Hill, he was a leading underworld figure north of the border. In 1966 he escaped death when a bomb exploded in his MG sports car, but his mother-in-law, in the passenger seat, was killed. Arthur suspected that two men from the rival Welsh clan, Patrick Welsh and James Goldie, had planted the bomb. Some time afterwards he spotted them in their van. He drove his Jaguar straight at the van, forcing it off the road and into a lamppost, killing Welsh and Goldie. Arthur was charged with their murders, but he was set free because no witnesses came forward to testify. The incident was part of a long feud between the two clans. In 1969 Thompson's wife, Rita, forced her way into the Welsh home, stabbed Patrick Welsh's wife in the chest, and was jailed for three years. By the Eighties, the Thompson clan had moved into the drug trade led by the Thompsons' eldest son, Arthur Jnr, known as Fat Boy, who operated out of Blackpool. As money rolled in, they converted their council home into a palace, buying the property next door and knocking the two together. This luxury fortress was known as 'The Ponderosa'. Disaster struck in 1985 when Fat Boy was jailed for 11 years when he fell victim to a huge heroin bust. His team, the Barlanark Gang, initially continued paying him a cut, but the two sides quickly fell out as the Gang found new paymasters. The jailing of Fat Boy brought challenges from gangs hoping to take over the Thompson empire. In 1988 Arthur was shot in the groin outside The Ponderosa. He booked himself into a private clinic and told the police the injury had been caused by a drill bit which broke off. Three years later, a car mounted the pavement outside his home and ran him over. Again, Arthur survived and refused to make any statement to the police. In 1989, Arthur's daughter, Margaret, died of a drugs overdose. Two years later Fat Boy was gunned down outside The Ponderosa just six hours after coming home from prison on weekend leave. He died in his father's arms. A few hours before Fat Boy's funeral, the bodies of local hardmen Bobby Glover and Joe 'Bananas' Hanlon, widely thought to be responsible for Fat Boy's death, were found outside a bar in east Glasgow. They had each been shot in the back of the head, with an extra bullet fired up their anuses for good measure. Another local hard man, Paul Ferris, was charged with Fat Boy's murder, but cleared after Scotland's longest criminal trial. He has since been jailed for involvement in a firearms conspiracy. The spot where Fat Boy died is just a few yards from where Billy Thompson was stabbed 10 months ago during the unsuccessful first attempt on his life and a short distance from the site of the most recent attack. Arthur Thompson Snr died of a heart attack in 1993. His death, coupled with the jailing of Paul Ferris on firearms charges in 1999, left a void which has generated a wave of violence. In May, veteran gangland boss Frank McPhee was shot through the head on his doorstep, as his 11-year-old son looked on in terror. Police have run up against a wall of silence, but believe the murder is linked to drugs. One theory is that McPhee had tried to muscle in on the drug trade controlled by former Irish terrorists. He had been a regular visitor to Northern Ireland. A sniper waited for him after he had been chased through Glasgow by another hitman. He had been responsible for negotiating between dealers in the North and the rest of England. He was killed by a single shot from a high-powered .22 rifle. One detective on the case said: 'He had been a dead man walking for years. For McPhee, the end was always going to come like this.' Police are probing his links with a big dogfighting ring. The battle for Glasgow's underworld is being further complicated by the arrival of a new clan of Triad gangsters attempting to take over the drug trade. Earlier this year, pitched battles broke out in Chinese restaurants between the Wo Sing Wo Triad and their rivals, the Tai Huen Chair or Big Circle Gang. Another underworld figure vying for control is a 65-year-old Scot, Billy Blackledge, who has been on the run from the FBI for 10 years for his involvement in a \u00a310 million drugs deal involving Hell's Angels from Canada. He is said to run his empire from a luxury yacht. According to underworld sources, Billy Thompson, who has served a number of prison sentences and has a heroin habit, wanted to regain the former prominence of the Thompson name, despite the fact that he has not inherited any of his father's business acumen. He was jailed three years ago for carrying a knife and, a week after his release, was jailed again for carrying a harpoon gun. On both occasions, he told police that he feared for his life. Billy Thompson has now been taken off the critical list and looks set to make a full recovery. But the damage to his family's already tattered reputation, not to mention the violent implications for Glasgow's underworld, look set to last for some time to come.",

Walls were covered with graffiti and the majority of the furniture was in poor repair. Mattresses were worn and curtains not provided. Toilet areas in shared cells and dormitories did not have doors or screens. The worst examples were found in single cells that were occupied by two young prisoners in which the toilet was only several inches away from the bunk beds and without privacy screens.' </b> Inspectors' report, September 1999 <br> <p>The case of a vulnerable teenager who killed himself at a young offenders' institution earlier this month will be taken up by children's charities and prison reformers in an effort to persuade the Government to abandon the practice of locking up young people under 18. </p> <p>Phillip Griffin, 17, from Leeds, who had been abandoned by his family, was serving a 10-month sentence for theft, burglary and robbery in Wetherby Young Offenders' Institution in West Yorkshire, despite warnings from his lawyer that he would not be able to cope with life inside. </p> <p>Griffin was only weeks into his sentence when he was found hanged in his cell on 1 August. </p> <p>The initiative by the Children's Society and the Howard League for Penal Reform comes just days after the resignation of Ian Thomas, who stood down as deputy governor of Feltham Young Offenders' Institution in west London after another teenager attempted suicide. </p> <p>The reformers believe that the increase in the number of young people given custodial sentences has left the youth justice system at breaking point. Since 1995, at least 26 people have committed suicide in young offenders' institutions, more than twice the number in the previous five years. Last year alone eight young people killed themselves in prison. </p> <p>Sharon Moore, who runs the Children's Society's remand project, said last night: 'These places have become the dumping ground for some of the most vulnerable young people in our society. Prison just brutalises and isolates them; this case is an example of how it can go terribly wrong.' </p> <p>She said young offenders' institutions and local authority secure units for even younger children were full to bursting point. </p> <p>New inmates were subjected to ritual humiliation on their arrival, a Children's Society worker at a West Midlands young offenders' institution told The Observer. Jan Chown said the younger boys were forced to shout nursery rhymes from the windows of their cells to identify them for future bullying. 'It is completely degrading. This kind of experience does absolutely nothing for these children who would be better off serving their sentences in the community.' </p> <p>Griffin was homeless and his family had, in the words of his lawyer, 'washed their hands of him' when he was caught attempting to burgle a house. The court heard how he broke down in tears in the street when he was apprehended by a neighbour. </p> <p>His solicitor, Mark Pritchard, said: 'I expressed my concern on the day he was remanded. It was his first time in prison and he didn't seem stable.' Because he had also been an accomplice in a cashpoint robbery and because 17-year-olds are effectively treated as adults within the criminal justice system, the courts were given little choice but to give him a custodial sentence. Serious questions are now being raised about reports written while Griffin was on remand at Doncaster prison, which said he was adapting well to prison life. </p> <p>Pritchard has now raised the case of a 15-year-old on remand at Doncaster who cannot be named for legal reasons. He was assessed as vulnerable in Doncaster prison, where he was being bullied. He phones his solicitor every day, telling him that he does not think he can survive the regime. He has been recommended for transfer to a secure unit for juveniles, but has been told he is fourteenth on the waiting list. </p> <p>Frances Crook, of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said that the two Yorkshire cases were not isolated examples. 'There are simply too many kids in the system, so they end up being stockpiled in prisons. The number of children in secure units has risen from 200 to 400 over the last year. More children will die if this continues.' </p> <p>Campaigners have seized on the resignation of Thomas, who left his \u00a338,000 a year post as deputy governor in charge of Feltham's juvenile wing on Thursday. Thomas, 29, described children as being 'warehoused' in Dickensian conditions. 'It doesn't take a genius to work out the possible tragic consequences of such an approach,' he said. </p> <p>The Children's Society, which is an arm of the Church of England, is calling on the Government to give a commitment to removing all under-18s from prisons. The Chief Inspector of Prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham, has sharply criticised several young offenders' institutions including Feltham, Portland and Glen Parva. </p> <p>A decade ago, the then Conservative government pledged to end imprisonment for 15- and 16-year-olds when it introduced new criminal justice legislation. Section 60 of the 1991 Criminal Justice Act outlawed the imprisonment on remand of 15- and 16-year-olds, but a subsequent section said the practice could continue if there was not enough space in local authority secure accommodation. Since then there has never been enough space outside prisons and so the incarceration of children has continued. </p> <p>The Children's Society, which already works with young offenders in Feltham and Wetherby, has successfully persuaded the Government to back an extension of its bail support system. The society claims this has a 70 per cent success rate in helping young offenders stick to bail conditions and report to court on time.</p>",

The initiative by the Children's Society and the Howard League for Penal Reform comes just days after the resignation of Ian Thomas, who stood down as deputy governor of Feltham Young Offenders' Institution in west London after another teenager attempted suicide. The reformers believe that the increase in the number of young people given custodial sentences has left the youth justice system at breaking point. Since 1995, at least 26 people have committed suicide in young offenders' institutions, more than twice the number in the previous five years. Last year alone eight young people killed themselves in prison. Sharon Moore, who runs the Children's Society's remand project, said last night: 'These places have become the dumping ground for some of the most vulnerable young people in our society. Prison just brutalises and isolates them; this case is an example of how it can go terribly wrong.' She said young offenders' institutions and local authority secure units for even younger children were full to bursting point. New inmates were subjected to ritual humiliation on their arrival, a Children's Society worker at a West Midlands young offenders' institution told The Observer. Jan Chown said the younger boys were forced to shout nursery rhymes from the windows of their cells to identify them for future bullying. 'It is completely degrading. This kind of experience does absolutely nothing for these children who would be better off serving their sentences in the community.' Griffin was homeless and his family had, in the words of his lawyer, 'washed their hands of him' when he was caught attempting to burgle a house. The court heard how he broke down in tears in the street when he was apprehended by a neighbour. His solicitor, Mark Pritchard, said: 'I expressed my concern on the day he was remanded. It was his first time in prison and he didn't seem stable.' Because he had also been an accomplice in a cashpoint robbery and because 17-year-olds are effectively treated as adults within the criminal justice system, the courts were given little choice but to give him a custodial sentence. Serious questions are now being raised about reports written while Griffin was on remand at Doncaster prison, which said he was adapting well to prison life. Pritchard has now raised the case of a 15-year-old on remand at Doncaster who cannot be named for legal reasons. He was assessed as vulnerable in Doncaster prison, where he was being bullied. He phones his solicitor every day, telling him that he does not think he can survive the regime. He has been recommended for transfer to a secure unit for juveniles, but has been told he is fourteenth on the waiting list. Frances Crook, of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said that the two Yorkshire cases were not isolated examples. 'There are simply too many kids in the system, so they end up being stockpiled in prisons. The number of children in secure units has risen from 200 to 400 over the last year. More children will die if this continues.' Campaigners have seized on the resignation of Thomas, who left his \u00a338,000 a year post as deputy governor in charge of Feltham's juvenile wing on Thursday. Thomas, 29, described children as being 'warehoused' in Dickensian conditions. 'It doesn't take a genius to work out the possible tragic consequences of such an approach,' he said. The Children's Society, which is an arm of the Church of England, is calling on the Government to give a commitment to removing all under-18s from prisons. The Chief Inspector of Prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham, has sharply criticised several young offenders' institutions including Feltham, Portland and Glen Parva. A decade ago, the then Conservative government pledged to end imprisonment for 15- and 16-year-olds when it introduced new criminal justice legislation. Section 60 of the 1991 Criminal Justice Act outlawed the imprisonment on remand of 15- and 16-year-olds, but a subsequent section said the practice could continue if there was not enough space in local authority secure accommodation. Since then there has never been enough space outside prisons and so the incarceration of children has continued. The Children's Society, which already works with young offenders in Feltham and Wetherby, has successfully persuaded the Government to back an extension of its bail support system. The society claims this has a 70 per cent success rate in helping young offenders stick to bail conditions and report to court on time.",

It's hugely rapid growth. Our timing has been impeccable. We've touched a raw nerve. We couldn't have done this if Labour hadn't been elected. People needed to see for themselves Labour in power.</p> <p>'People are absolutely disenchanted. And in Scotland Labour has a few problems. There is not just one alternative - the SNP - there are two - the SNP and us. The SNP's problem is that they lack clarity in what they stand for, as the leadership election shows.' By contrast the SSP has a 'clear ideological programme'. What is it? 'We want an independent socialist Scotland that raises the need for common ownership and social control of our economy back on the political agenda.'</p> <p>The Scottish Parliament so far, he concedes, has been disappointing. It has too few powers but what annoys him is that it has been unwilling to use those it does have - for example over local taxation.</p> <p>Sheridan wants to replace the regressive council tax, which hits the poor as it hits the rich, with a Scottish service tax. It would exempt all those earning less than \u00a310,000 a year, would be collected at source, remove the need for warrant sales and last year would have generated \u00a3100 million more than council tax.</p> <p>'You could to it tomorrow. But they're not willing to use even the limited powers they've got to effect social change and introduce more equality into our society.'</p> <p>The SSP plans to contest the next General Election 'in a big way'. He says: 'We're going to try to stand in all 72 seats - even though our undemocratic electoral system, based on money, means that we'll need \u00a372,000 to cover deposits and materials.' He adds: 'It's a lot of money for a small Scottish party. But we're going to go for it. We're standing to build a profile. We're standing to gain party loyalty.'</p> <p>The next Scottish elections in 2003 he sees as a major opportunity. Sheridan hopes the party can win 10 or more seats and thinks eight-to-10 well within its grasp. He continues: 'The SNP, I think, will gain and Labour will lose, the Liberal Democrats will lose. You might have the SNP then looking to form an administration with some of the smaller parties. If that happened then our demand would be that our redistributive policies are on the agenda. That's a price the SNP would have to pay. Whether they'd be willing to pay it I don't know but we wouldn't be easy negotiators. We're not after power for power's sake. Our whole history has shown that.'</p> <p>Sheridan describes himself as a 'revolutionary' committed to an open and democratic road. Essentially, one senses, he is still part of the Labour left in exile. Tony Benn is among his heroes.</p> <p>It is no accident that his co-sponsors of the Bill to abolish warrant sales are John McAllion, the often dissident Labour MSP, and Alex Neil, who is standing on a left-wing ticket for the SNP leadership. Tommy Sheridan has his eyes on the fringes of both the main parties and may yet emerge as a strategic figure capable of uniting the Scottish left.</p>",

'People are absolutely disenchanted. And in Scotland Labour has a few problems. There is not just one alternative - the SNP - there are two - the SNP and us. The SNP's problem is that they lack clarity in what they stand for, as the leadership election shows.' By contrast the SSP has a 'clear ideological programme'. What is it? 'We want an independent socialist Scotland that raises the need for common ownership and social control of our economy back on the political agenda.' The Scottish Parliament so far, he concedes, has been disappointing. It has too few powers but what annoys him is that it has been unwilling to use those it does have - for example over local taxation. Sheridan wants to replace the regressive council tax, which hits the poor as it hits the rich, with a Scottish service tax. It would exempt all those earning less than \u00a310,000 a year, would be collected at source, remove the need for warrant sales and last year would have generated \u00a3100 million more than council tax. 'You could to it tomorrow. But they're not willing to use even the limited powers they've got to effect social change and introduce more equality into our society.' The SSP plans to contest the next General Election 'in a big way'. He says: 'We're going to try to stand in all 72 seats - even though our undemocratic electoral system, based on money, means that we'll need \u00a372,000 to cover deposits and materials.' He adds: 'It's a lot of money for a small Scottish party. But we're going to go for it. We're standing to build a profile. We're standing to gain party loyalty.' The next Scottish elections in 2003 he sees as a major opportunity. Sheridan hopes the party can win 10 or more seats and thinks eight-to-10 well within its grasp. He continues: 'The SNP, I think, will gain and Labour will lose, the Liberal Democrats will lose. You might have the SNP then looking to form an administration with some of the smaller parties. If that happened then our demand would be that our redistributive policies are on the agenda. That's a price the SNP would have to pay. Whether they'd be willing to pay it I don't know but we wouldn't be easy negotiators. We're not after power for power's sake. Our whole history has shown that.' Sheridan describes himself as a 'revolutionary' committed to an open and democratic road. Essentially, one senses, he is still part of the Labour left in exile. Tony Benn is among his heroes. It is no accident that his co-sponsors of the Bill to abolish warrant sales are John McAllion, the often dissident Labour MSP, and Alex Neil, who is standing on a left-wing ticket for the SNP leadership. Tommy Sheridan has his eyes on the fringes of both the main parties and may yet emerge as a strategic figure capable of uniting the Scottish left.",

The big money, however, is in driven grouse, where shooters in butts take on whirling grouse forced from the heather towards them by a line of beaters.

      "bodyText": "French men are to be encouraged to come to England to be sterilised. Marie Stopes, the British family planning charity, plans to offer the first 'vasectomy tourism service' and is targeting the men reputed to be the world's best lovers because the operation is illegal in France. The service will be launched tomorrow at a press conference during which a Frenchman will be sterilised to prove how easy it is. Bernard Schnakenbourg, a father of one, will then recount his experience. Doctors in France can be imprisoned for performing vasectomies under a law against 'self-mutilation' introduced by Napoleon. The procedure can be undertaken only in cases where there are strong medical reasons. Britain is the world's vasectomy capital, with more men being snipped than in any other country. According to UN figures, 16 per cent of British men of reproductive age have had the operation. Marie Stopes will suggest that the operation can be undertaken in a day trip from Paris, or as spokesman Tom Kerridge suggested: 'Why not enjoy London for a couple of days while you're at it?' The procedure, which is usually irreversible, costs \u00a3200 and involves cauterising the tubes that carry the sperm with a laser tool. Schnakenbourg, 47, said: 'I am prepared to travel to the UK to access a vasectomy because my partner and I do not want any more children and I think it is only fair that couples share the responsibility for contraception.' Vasectomies are engulfed by taboos in France, where Marie Stopes has found it hard to place adverts for the service. One features a variation of a traditional Napoleon pose - with his hand below his belt - and the caption: 'Two hundred years on, he's still got a grip on them.'",

      "body": "<p>As the service began, a small girl tucked her knees under her chin and nervously slammed her fist down again and again onto the seat next to her. Behind, an even younger boy began howling. But there was no irritation among the adults. Parents gently held their fractious children, their neighbours smiled sadly, and the service to remember Sarah Evelyn Isobel Payne, the eight-year-old girl whose brutal murder sparked a nationwide debate into the risks our children live alongside, continued.</p> <p>The 40-minute service at Guildford Cathedral yesterday was attended by around 600 mourners. Sarah's favourite hymns 'All Things Bright and Beautiful', 'Morning has Broken' and 'Lord of the Dance' were sung.</p> <p>Jonathan Good, Sarah's teacher remembered how, before her death, Sarah had taken to drawing pictures of children doing handstand races. Pictures, he added, that were best appreciated when upside down.</p> <p>During a trip to the seaside last summer, Good remembered Sarah and her friends undaunted by foul weather. They built a sandcastle so splendid the teacher felt compelled to give them a prize.</p> <p>Two brothers watched from behind a bush some distance off as Sarah's family released 12 white doves from the cathedral green. A middle-aged man strode into view, dishevelled and a little shaky on his feet. 'Who's that?' the youngest boy asked. His brother hesitated. 'Not sure.' The man, unaware of the children, stumbled closer and the brothers grasped each other's hands and bolted back to their mother, who held them tight. And didn't let go.</p> <p>Children are at the forefront of the current debate about paedophiles in our midst. On vigilante marches and in family homes, parents say they are protesting for the love of children. But are they teaching every child to hate?</p> <p>They are certainly participating in the debates. Take 13-year-old Jodie and Sadie, 12, who made a dummy, painted 'paedo' on its chest and strung it by the neck from a lamppost in Portsmouth's Paulsgrove council estate, where the nation's post-Sarah Payne revulsion toward paedophiles boiled into violence and protests over the past week.</p> <p>Small children talk of 'pervs' and 'bashing their heads in'.</p> <p>Mothers say the summer holidays have been spoiled, that they won't let their kids out of their sight. Children tell you they are scared.</p> <p>Lynn Webb, 35, shows placards her four children made for the protest marches, cut from Fisher Price toy boxes.</p> <p>'Elly helped the girls colour them in,' said Webb, 35. Toddler Elly grinned.</p> <p>'People have said I'm wrong to take children on marches till midnight but I'm a single mum and I can't leave them here. They want to go. This is for them after all and nobody ever gives children a voice. We've got a perv over the road and he's always giving kids funny looks.'</p> <p>Jodie is scared: 'I want to go out with my friends but I won't because of all them pervs out there.'</p> <p>Like many, Webb believes child abduction is commonplace and that there is far more threat to children today than there was in her youth. Both perceptions are not borne out by statistics.</p> <p>In Paulgrove the children on social services' 'at risk' register outnumber the three or four men on the sexual offenders' register.</p> <p>Katrina Kessell was abused as a child. While she talks to The Observer her four children play in the garden with a rabbit under the watchful eye of their grandmother Mavis.</p> <p>A steady stream of visitors has been up and down the concrete path of the house where Kessell has been holding court for the media and, she says, for local people, often strangers, who have come to name names. She says people have been bringing her 'documentary evidence' of men they claim are paedophiles. 'They have been coming in and telling me the most terrible stories of how they were abused. It has been heartbreaking, we've all been in tears,' she said.</p> <p>Kessell says it was from these personal accounts that the protesters' list of 22 names - 'and still growing' - was compiled. Only the first, Victor Burnett, 53, published in the News of the World 's name and shame campaign, is a confirmed convicted sex offender. Last Sunday Burnett moved out of his home to a safe house. His sister's car was set alight.</p> <p>Five homes have so far been attacked during Paulsgrove's week of nighttime marches. Up to 10 fearful families and individuals have fled their homes. Kessell claims she did not begin the protests but has become a figurehead and holds the key to 'the list'.</p> <p>Kessell, who will only talk to The Observer in the presence of self-appointed press officer John Palmer, said: 'We all decide as a group whether someone should be on the list from the information we have gathered, we check all the details before we go and stand outside a house,' she said, refusing to say what kind of proof is required.</p> <p>Michelle lives in an immaculately clean house filled with collectors' dolls and pictures of Elvis. Her five children, well-mannered and well-behaved, are not allowed out to play by themselves.</p> <p>'This is all about how we must change the law. It's not right for these people to live among children. We should put them all together on an island,' she said. 'And blow it up,' 10-year-old Kevin interjects. 'Pervs are everywhere.' Four-year-old Chad pipes up : 'I'll kick them in the nuts.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "As the service began, a small girl tucked her knees under her chin and nervously slammed her fist down again and again onto the seat next to her. Behind, an even younger boy began howling. But there was no irritation among the adults. Parents gently held their fractious children, their neighbours smiled sadly, and the service to remember Sarah Evelyn Isobel Payne, the eight-year-old girl whose brutal murder sparked a nationwide debate into the risks our children live alongside, continued. The 40-minute service at Guildford Cathedral yesterday was attended by around 600 mourners. Sarah's favourite hymns 'All Things Bright and Beautiful', 'Morning has Broken' and 'Lord of the Dance' were sung. Jonathan Good, Sarah's teacher remembered how, before her death, Sarah had taken to drawing pictures of children doing handstand races. Pictures, he added, that were best appreciated when upside down. During a trip to the seaside last summer, Good remembered Sarah and her friends undaunted by foul weather. They built a sandcastle so splendid the teacher felt compelled to give them a prize. Two brothers watched from behind a bush some distance off as Sarah's family released 12 white doves from the cathedral green. A middle-aged man strode into view, dishevelled and a little shaky on his feet. 'Who's that?' the youngest boy asked. His brother hesitated. 'Not sure.' The man, unaware of the children, stumbled closer and the brothers grasped each other's hands and bolted back to their mother, who held them tight. And didn't let go. Children are at the forefront of the current debate about paedophiles in our midst. On vigilante marches and in family homes, parents say they are protesting for the love of children. But are they teaching every child to hate? They are certainly participating in the debates. Take 13-year-old Jodie and Sadie, 12, who made a dummy, painted 'paedo' on its chest and strung it by the neck from a lamppost in Portsmouth's Paulsgrove council estate, where the nation's post-Sarah Payne revulsion toward paedophiles boiled into violence and protests over the past week. Small children talk of 'pervs' and 'bashing their heads in'. Mothers say the summer holidays have been spoiled, that they won't let their kids out of their sight. Children tell you they are scared. Lynn Webb, 35, shows placards her four children made for the protest marches, cut from Fisher Price toy boxes. 'Elly helped the girls colour them in,' said Webb, 35. Toddler Elly grinned. 'People have said I'm wrong to take children on marches till midnight but I'm a single mum and I can't leave them here. They want to go. This is for them after all and nobody ever gives children a voice. We've got a perv over the road and he's always giving kids funny looks.' Jodie is scared: 'I want to go out with my friends but I won't because of all them pervs out there.' Like many, Webb believes child abduction is commonplace and that there is far more threat to children today than there was in her youth. Both perceptions are not borne out by statistics. In Paulgrove the children on social services' 'at risk' register outnumber the three or four men on the sexual offenders' register. Katrina Kessell was abused as a child. While she talks to The Observer her four children play in the garden with a rabbit under the watchful eye of their grandmother Mavis. A steady stream of visitors has been up and down the concrete path of the house where Kessell has been holding court for the media and, she says, for local people, often strangers, who have come to name names. She says people have been bringing her 'documentary evidence' of men they claim are paedophiles. 'They have been coming in and telling me the most terrible stories of how they were abused. It has been heartbreaking, we've all been in tears,' she said. Kessell says it was from these personal accounts that the protesters' list of 22 names - 'and still growing' - was compiled. Only the first, Victor Burnett, 53, published in the News of the World 's name and shame campaign, is a confirmed convicted sex offender. Last Sunday Burnett moved out of his home to a safe house. His sister's car was set alight. Five homes have so far been attacked during Paulsgrove's week of nighttime marches. Up to 10 fearful families and individuals have fled their homes. Kessell claims she did not begin the protests but has become a figurehead and holds the key to 'the list'. Kessell, who will only talk to The Observer in the presence of self-appointed press officer John Palmer, said: 'We all decide as a group whether someone should be on the list from the information we have gathered, we check all the details before we go and stand outside a house,' she said, refusing to say what kind of proof is required. Michelle lives in an immaculately clean house filled with collectors' dolls and pictures of Elvis. Her five children, well-mannered and well-behaved, are not allowed out to play by themselves. 'This is all about how we must change the law. It's not right for these people to live among children. We should put them all together on an island,' she said. 'And blow it up,' 10-year-old Kevin interjects. 'Pervs are everywhere.' Four-year-old Chad pipes up : 'I'll kick them in the nuts.'",

A damning report, which is based on an analysis of Ministry of Defence spending since 1993, will show this week that it can take more than 14 years from making a decision to buy new military equipment to its being put into service. Such long delays mean that by the time the new equipment is in place it has often been overtaken by technological advances and become obsolete. Millions more pounds are then needed to update it. Even equipment that is bought 'off-the-shelf' and supposedly ready for use takes six years to come into service. Cost overruns, delays and technical problems all add to the MoD's financial woes, the report says. The document, prepared for MPs investigating the performance of the MoD and obtained by The Observer , comes just days after General Sir Charles Guthrie, the Chief of Defence Staff, warned that a staff crisis and lack of resources were undermining the armed forces' strength as effective fighting units. Such a huge amount of wasted money will be damaging for the Ministry of Defence, which has recently received one of the biggest increases in its budget from the Treasury since 1997. 'Analysis of the trends in cost and time performance since 1993 shows that there is no evidence that the departments are controlling projects any better than in the past,' says the report.

      "byline": "Heather Connon",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The mapping of the human genome has confirmed Darwin's theory of evolution, according to Bill Castell, chief executive of Nycomed Amersham. He is hoping that the Nasdaq flotation of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (APB) will finally persuade investors that his group has evolved into one of the stars of the healthcare industry. </p> <p>Nycomed Amersham has undoubtedly made great strides since 1990 when, to quote Castell, its idea of innovation was to put radioactive material in a different-shaped phial. Now, it is a global business with a market-leading position in imaging, its instruments were used to sequence three of the first four chromosomes to be mapped, and it is a market leader in the fast-growing area of genetic sequencing. </p> <p>The City has not ignored the transformation. A share price which is about 29 times the expected earnings for the full year is a decent premium to the market, but is more than 10 per cent below pharmaceuticals companies such as GlaxoWellcome or its betrothed, SmithKline Beecham. And they do not have a hi-tech gene mapping subsidiary to float. </p> <p>Nycomed Amersham is clearly convinced that floating 10 per cent of APB, planned for the autumn, will unlock hidden value in the group. The genetic blueprint may now be complete, but the big bucks will be made in exploiting that information. There are plenty of rivals muscling in on its territory, but none covers the waterfront in quite the way Nycomed Amersham does. </p> <p>Analysts estimate that the business will attract a valuation between $4 billion and $6bn (\u00a32.6bn to \u00a34bn). That would value its share at around \u00a31.9bn, leaving the remainder of Amersham's businesses valued at just over \u00a32bn, or less than 20 times earnings. True, some parts of the business - such as its seeds for cancer therapy and some of its unpatented products - are achieving pedestrian sales growth. But the core imaging business managed a 17 per cent sales increase, driven by products such as Myoview, its heart diagnostic product. </p> <p>Critics point out that half of APB is in research products, where sales last year rose by just 3 per cent, and wonder whether the float will achieve the valuations predicted. And they question whether the rest of Amersham deserves a premium rating. But Castell and his team have done an excellent job evolving Amersham from a public-sector monolith to a highly focused, innovative business. That will eventually be recognised in the price. Buy the shares. </p> <p><strong> Reed sounds a stronger note</strong><br> </p> <p> Crispin Davis's appointment as chief executive of Reed Elsevier may not have been greeted with universal acclaim but, a year on, the City is finally warming to his approach. Interim profit before tax may have fallen 4 per cent, after adjusting for things like currency and exceptional items, but that was because of increased investment on internet initiatives. The underlying picture was of a business which not only knows where it wants to go - something the old management was good at - but also has a plan to get there. </p> <p>There are new executives in key management positions (apart from finance director) and Davis appears to have tight control. The \u00a3750 million three-year internet investment programme announced in February is already bearing fruit. So far, \u00a3110m has been spent, rising to \u00a3260m by the year-end. </p> <p>Internet-generated sales reached \u00a3160m in the first six months of 2000, and are expected to be \u00a3400m for the whole year. The science division was the biggest beneficiary. But there are also signs that it has managed to stop the rot in the legal business, where it has launched a service for small firms and is establishing a good presence in universities. </p> <p>On cost control, it is likely to exceed the promised \u00a3130m savings this year, suggesting there was a lot more fat in the group than analysts realised. </p> <p>The only thing that really spooked the City was Davis's interest in US publisher Harcourt Brace, which is up for sale. But analysts take the view that Davis was expressing more a healthy interest in the affairs of its rivals than a serious intention to acquire. </p> <p>After a faltering start, Reed's shares have recovered strongly in the past two months.

      "bodyText": "The mapping of the human genome has confirmed Darwin's theory of evolution, according to Bill Castell, chief executive of Nycomed Amersham. He is hoping that the Nasdaq flotation of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (APB) will finally persuade investors that his group has evolved into one of the stars of the healthcare industry. Nycomed Amersham has undoubtedly made great strides since 1990 when, to quote Castell, its idea of innovation was to put radioactive material in a different-shaped phial. Now, it is a global business with a market-leading position in imaging, its instruments were used to sequence three of the first four chromosomes to be mapped, and it is a market leader in the fast-growing area of genetic sequencing. The City has not ignored the transformation. A share price which is about 29 times the expected earnings for the full year is a decent premium to the market, but is more than 10 per cent below pharmaceuticals companies such as GlaxoWellcome or its betrothed, SmithKline Beecham. And they do not have a hi-tech gene mapping subsidiary to float. Nycomed Amersham is clearly convinced that floating 10 per cent of APB, planned for the autumn, will unlock hidden value in the group. The genetic blueprint may now be complete, but the big bucks will be made in exploiting that information. There are plenty of rivals muscling in on its territory, but none covers the waterfront in quite the way Nycomed Amersham does. Analysts estimate that the business will attract a valuation between $4 billion and $6bn (\u00a32.6bn to \u00a34bn). That would value its share at around \u00a31.9bn, leaving the remainder of Amersham's businesses valued at just over \u00a32bn, or less than 20 times earnings. True, some parts of the business - such as its seeds for cancer therapy and some of its unpatented products - are achieving pedestrian sales growth. But the core imaging business managed a 17 per cent sales increase, driven by products such as Myoview, its heart diagnostic product. Critics point out that half of APB is in research products, where sales last year rose by just 3 per cent, and wonder whether the float will achieve the valuations predicted. And they question whether the rest of Amersham deserves a premium rating. But Castell and his team have done an excellent job evolving Amersham from a public-sector monolith to a highly focused, innovative business. That will eventually be recognised in the price. Buy the shares. Reed sounds a stronger note Crispin Davis's appointment as chief executive of Reed Elsevier may not have been greeted with universal acclaim but, a year on, the City is finally warming to his approach. Interim profit before tax may have fallen 4 per cent, after adjusting for things like currency and exceptional items, but that was because of increased investment on internet initiatives. The underlying picture was of a business which not only knows where it wants to go - something the old management was good at - but also has a plan to get there. There are new executives in key management positions (apart from finance director) and Davis appears to have tight control. The \u00a3750 million three-year internet investment programme announced in February is already bearing fruit. So far, \u00a3110m has been spent, rising to \u00a3260m by the year-end. Internet-generated sales reached \u00a3160m in the first six months of 2000, and are expected to be \u00a3400m for the whole year. The science division was the biggest beneficiary. But there are also signs that it has managed to stop the rot in the legal business, where it has launched a service for small firms and is establishing a good presence in universities. On cost control, it is likely to exceed the promised \u00a3130m savings this year, suggesting there was a lot more fat in the group than analysts realised. The only thing that really spooked the City was Davis's interest in US publisher Harcourt Brace, which is up for sale. But analysts take the view that Davis was expressing more a healthy interest in the affairs of its rivals than a serious intention to acquire. After a faltering start, Reed's shares have recovered strongly in the past two months. They may now pause for breath, but those prepared to wait for their rewards should buy now. Bolt from Colt is over the top The collapse in Colt Telecom's share price after Paul Chisholm, its president and chief executive, announced that he planned to spend more time with his family in the US, perfectly illustrates how illogical the City's attitude to technology stocks is. Colt Telecom is one of the more successful of the new generation of phone operators. It has done all it promised in establishing its European network, attracting large corporate customers and increasing its revenue. The number of buildings connected to its network in the second quarter of the year jumped by 68 per cent over last year, while the number of minutes switched rose by 138 per cent. Profits are, of course, still a rather distant prospect but at least it has funds - \u00a32bn to be precise - which should be enough to get it into that position. Chisolm's departure is significant. He was the driving force behind the company's growth and will be missed. But he is hardly making a dash for the door with binbags full of trade secrets.

But such high-flying companies are valued less on common sense than on sentiment. Any unexpected news is likely to move the price sharply. That does not make it logical, however.

Pemberton won't say what Ford told him and Ford is not talking either, but minutes later a white-faced Pemberton returned to his office, put a few personal belongings into a carrier bag and left the building. He has not been back since. </p> <p>Pemberton's sacking has left staff at the music title reeling, and focused attention on a rising tide of discontent among staff at Emap, Q's owner. After months of internal turmoil, they say, the departure of the popular and talented editor marks the end of an era at Britain's leading magazine group, which publishes 150 titles including best-selling men's magazine FHM and entertainment weekly Heat . </p> <p>Ever since Sir Richard Winfrey bought the Spalding Guardian in 1887 and Emap was born as East Midlands Allied Press, the company, has been 'different', staff say. Unlike other giant magazine companies - IPC or NatMags - the company was run by journalists for journalists. Managers wrote record reviews, signed articles and even did a little moonlighting on the sub-editors' desk. There was none of the 'them' and 'us' culture that characterises other publishers. </p> <p>'The wages were never that great but that did not matter,' one former editor says. 'People worked there because they liked it. It was a good vibe. Most magazines that focus on music, glamour, showbiz, celebrity and style are not that glamorous to work for. In fact, they can be bloody awful. Emap magazines like Q and Empire never used to be like that. We saw them as pretty utopian - until now. Andy's sacking was like a terrorist murdering a hostage in front of a group of captives to demonstrate that they mean business.' </p> <p>Pemberton's dismissal from Emap's flagship music title has left staff bitter. They claim he was the victim of a heavy-handed new management structure which is ignoring the company's key titles in favour of new media ventures. The company is now scarcely recognisable as the one they joined. </p> <p>The change began, staff say, when Emap bought and and relaunched FHM , its rival to IPC's beer-and-babes mag, Loaded . It was a huge success, with sales of almost a million. From being a publisher of high-quality mags in niche markets - from music and cinema to motorcycle news and angling - Emap had broken into the big time. </p> <p>'The company was blown away by the success of FHM and realised it could make its way into the mainstream and the money,' the former editor went on. 'Management thought it could boost profits by targeting new advertisers and readers who preferred pictures to text. The balance of the company suddenly changed. Nothing has been the same since.' </p> <p>Insiders say that following the success of FHM, new management teams were installed and stopped nurturing the successful Q and Empire to concentrate on new media. 'Their successful titles were totally taken for granted,' says one. Key members of the magazines' original staff were sidelined, and new business methods introduced. Editors who were not presiding over rapidly rising circulations were sacked. </p> <p>Pemberton fell foul of the new management style - and staff are wondering who will be next. 'We present this glossy glamorous image to the outside world, but the tactics of a tabloid newspaper have come in and are poisoning the atmosphere. Everyone is worried,' one staffer said. </p> <p>Journalists say that with so many new managers, working out the company's strategy is almost impossible. </p> <p>'There are so many new faces running the company now that it is hard to know who is doing what, and what the company's vision is,' says one. 'In the past everyone shared a love of the job and pretty much worked together. </p> <p>'Now the company seems to be investing all its efforts into developing titles on the internet. From being choc full of people who loved magazines, it is full of marketing people and ad men who seem to want to turn everything into a lifestyle product because that will sell more ads for Caterpillar boots. </p> <p>'People are massively disillusioned. They think they joined a magazine company, but the only thing everyone seems to be talking about is TV, radio and the internet. The core of the business is being forgotten.' </p> <p>Andrew Collins, former editor of Q, who left to become a TV script writer, says: 'When I run into the people I used to work with it is incredible. They just moan all the time. They write about pop stars and movie stars but they have all become miserable bastards. I do not want to sound like some old fart bemoaning the passing of the good old days, but you have to remember that the sort of dramatic changes that have taken place have happened in just three years. In some ways, I suppose, it is a victim of its own success, but it is sad to see it going that way.' </p> <p>Not surprisingly, executives at Emap, which has just launched a \u00a3250m, three-year investment programme, see things differently. </p> <p>'In the past three years the company has grown significantly,' a spokesman said. 'It has expanded in the US has grown rapidly in France to become the number two consumer magazines publisher there. We have created Emap Digital to take our publications online. FHM is being launched in Germany and up to nine more countries, taking the overall total to 20. This is not the sign of a company looking back. We're moving forward.' </p> <p>Recently reported figures show a 14 per cent rise in pretax profits to \u00a3184.3m, while total sales, benefiting from a first full-year contribution from Peterson, Emap's newly acquired US division, grew by 25 per cent to \u00a31.1 billion. </p> <p>The spokesman denied Emap was ignoring its key titles: 'Like any publisher we prize our content. If you go for something online, it has to have the right content. To suggest that we could go on line without getting the content right is daft. We value everyone who works for us and reads our magazines, listens to our radio stations or watches our TV channels.' </p> <p>Taking titles into new areas of the media reflected Emap's desire to improve the performance of its magazines and establish them as increasingly powerful brands. </p> <p>'We are creating brands that are focused on particular markets. To progress in the market you need mags, radio and websites so that you can go to an advertiser and tell them we can deliver a music market audience in the better than anyone else. Magazines like Q and Empire are still run for enthusiasts, but you have to grow the brand.'</p>",

The core of the business is being forgotten.' Andrew Collins, former editor of Q, who left to become a TV script writer, says: 'When I run into the people I used to work with it is incredible. They just moan all the time. They write about pop stars and movie stars but they have all become miserable bastards. I do not want to sound like some old fart bemoaning the passing of the good old days, but you have to remember that the sort of dramatic changes that have taken place have happened in just three years. In some ways, I suppose, it is a victim of its own success, but it is sad to see it going that way.' Not surprisingly, executives at Emap, which has just launched a \u00a3250m, three-year investment programme, see things differently. 'In the past three years the company has grown significantly,' a spokesman said. 'It has expanded in the US has grown rapidly in France to become the number two consumer magazines publisher there. We have created Emap Digital to take our publications online. FHM is being launched in Germany and up to nine more countries, taking the overall total to 20. This is not the sign of a company looking back. We're moving forward.' Recently reported figures show a 14 per cent rise in pretax profits to \u00a3184.3m, while total sales, benefiting from a first full-year contribution from Peterson, Emap's newly acquired US division, grew by 25 per cent to \u00a31.1 billion. The spokesman denied Emap was ignoring its key titles: 'Like any publisher we prize our content. If you go for something online, it has to have the right content. To suggest that we could go on line without getting the content right is daft. We value everyone who works for us and reads our magazines, listens to our radio stations or watches our TV channels.' Taking titles into new areas of the media reflected Emap's desire to improve the performance of its magazines and establish them as increasingly powerful brands. 'We are creating brands that are focused on particular markets. To progress in the market you need mags, radio and websites so that you can go to an advertiser and tell them we can deliver a music market audience in the better than anyone else. Magazines like Q and Empire are still run for enthusiasts, but you have to grow the brand.'",

These are heady days for our dear, creative friends in adland. Against a backdrop of a sustained economic boom, dotcom businesses with more money than sense are filling the agencies' coffers. Add the upcoming Olympics and the US presidential election and we are talking euphoria. Expect to see WPP's pre-tax profits leap from \u00a3112 million to around \u00a3135m. Revenues should be up \u00a3180m to \u00a31.2 billion, while earnings per share should increase to 11.7p from 9.8p. Analysts will expect signs that WPP, whose clients include Ford, is on track to meet its target of an operating profit of 14 per cent. They will also want a progress report on its takeover of \u00a33.2bn Y &amp; R, which is in the hands of regulatory authorities. This deal should be completed in the next month, with WPP controlling two-thirds of the merged outfit. It would be interesting to know whether WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell sees an end to the good times.",

Instead, you will unlock doors by pressing your finger prints on a special pad. Your eyes will enable you to access money or cross borders into foreign countries. Welcome to the world of biometrics. Biometric technology is easy to use and is becoming more affordable. Senior executives at Japanese giant Sony last May said biometrics would solve internet security fears. Other firms getting in on the act include Unisys and UK company TSSI. Today Lotus uses a handscanning device to allow its employees to remove their children from its work cr\u00e8che. At Coca Cola, workers enter offices and literally punch the clock using their hands. At Vancouver airport, frequent flyers can use a handscanning device to get through customs quickly. </p> <p>\u0095 At last an economic use for recycled glass. Quoted UK construction materials company RMC Group is turning recycled glass into tarmac for roads. RMC collects glass from local authorities, crushes it to the size of a stone and replaces 30 per cent of its normal aggregate material - limestone, granite or quarried stone - with glass. RMC just won a contract to use the technology in Warwickshire. The company believes 'glasphalt' will lift off after 2002 when an aggregate tax is introduced - recycled glass will be exempt. So recent press stories saying there is no point in recycling glass should be put back in the bottle. </p> <p>\u0095 After 23 years flying billions of miles, the Voyager space mission is only now starting to leave the outer reaches of our universe. But scientists are close to making long-distance space travel a 'speedy' reality. Using solar sails it will soon be possible for rockets to fly at speeds of 50 miles per second. Solar sails harness photons from the Sun and use them to push a spacecraft along. Their drawback lies in the sheer size of sail required to trap enough photons to produce effective thrust. However, inflatable booms supporting vast, ultra-thin reflectors could soon provide the answer to maintaining the sail's shape and result in practicable, free propulsion for space probes. In time, some scientists say, this technology could be applied to boats and planes on Earth. </p> <p>\u0095 Anyone who thinks that the mutual society is dead had better think again. Buying groups will help drive the economy of the future. They work by businesses clubbing together to bulk-order anything from stationery to insurance. It's possible to get 25 per cent discounts buying this way - vast cost savings previously enjoyed only by multinationals. Consultancy firm London Economics estimates small businesses could save \u00a324 billion, or 3 per cent of UK GDP, through forming buying groups. Already there are a number of 'intelligent intermediaries' which are encouraging small businesses to form collectives. Companies such as GroupTrade will grow rich by rounding up small businesses like sheep and organising their orders. </p> <p>\u0095 In five years, the current software industry will be dead,' says Nick Harper, technical architect of Webgenerics - a leading e-business solution provider. 'Why buy a CD for \u00a3200 when you can pay 25p for an application over the web?' Harper is talking about Application Service Provider, possibly the biggest innovation in information technology. We will access all our software via the web instead of by a CD, which is out of date by the time you install it. The result will be increased efficiency for businesses, which won't have to pay for as many technical back-up staff or for software upgrades. The dream of teleworking will become a workable reality thanks to ASP. For Microsoft, it will mean a seismic shift and the mass closure of its CD pressing plants. </p> <p>\u0095 Vaccine specialist Cantab Pharmaceuticals is testing a vaccine that blocks the addictive effects of cocaine on humans. It reports that so far there have not been any adverse reactions. It is also in the first pre-clinical stages of formulating a drug to prevent nicotine addiction. At least five other companies are in the advanced stages of animal testing for antibody therapies against two of the most dangerous drugs around: angel dust (phencyclidine) and ice (methamphetamine). Addiction-cure drugs are here and will raise a host of ethical issues. They are being developed for addicts and are not considered to be a preventative measure - for now. </p> <p>\u0095 It's enough to make a humourless Vulcan come out in a wry smile: the science fiction of 'beaming' objects from place to place is now a reality - at least for particles of light. In 1993, a team of North American scientists backed by IBM discovered a way to use quantum mechanics for teleportation. Two years ago scientists succeeded in 'entangling' a photon - a quantum of electromagnetic radiation - one metre across a lab bench. The California Institute of Telechnology and the University of Wales in Bangor are leaders in this research, which could eventually usher in a new kind of hyper-intelligent internet using quantum theory to 'teleport' information around the globe. </p> <p>Beaming yourself out of a traffic jam straight to the beach is still a pipe-dream, however. </p> <p>\u0095 The internal combustion engine will soon be history - oil reserves will not sustain its voracious appetite. The race is on to get the hydrogen-powered fuel cell car on sale. Fuel cell cars emit only water from their exhausts. Vauxhall claims its Zafira model has a top speed of 87 mph and says its 209lb stainless steel tank holds 11lb of hydrogen,which allows you to drive 250 miles before a refill. Honda, DaimlerChrysler and Ford all have equivalent products. At present, mass-producing a fuel cell engine would cost \u00a320,000, compared with \u00a32,000 for a diesel one. Still a way to go, but cars run on fuel cells will be with us by 2004. </p> <p>\u0095 Stem cells have been described as life's magic cauldron. A human starts as one cell - a fertilised egg - and divides to several trillion. Some of these cells are stem cells, which go to form anything a human body might need. Two years ago scientists discovered how to make new stem cells. Neuro stem cell therapy is possibly where the most exciting possibilities lie. </p> <p>A dozen biotech companies are working in this field: one is ReNeuron, which says that in the next 10 years the therapy could reverse the effects of strokes, brain damage through road accidents, epilepsy and dementia. ReNeuron is set to enter clinical trials within two years. </p> <p>The biggest problem is that ethical concerns have forced politicians in the US to withdraw public money from these projects. In Britain, red tape blocks neuro stem cell therapy's path. </p> <p>\u0095 Additional research by Ruth Hallam</p>",

Solar sails harness photons from the Sun and use them to push a spacecraft along. Their drawback lies in the sheer size of sail required to trap enough photons to produce effective thrust. However, inflatable booms supporting vast, ultra-thin reflectors could soon provide the answer to maintaining the sail's shape and result in practicable, free propulsion for space probes. In time, some scientists say, this technology could be applied to boats and planes on Earth. \u0095 Anyone who thinks that the mutual society is dead had better think again. Buying groups will help drive the economy of the future. They work by businesses clubbing together to bulk-order anything from stationery to insurance. It's possible to get 25 per cent discounts buying this way - vast cost savings previously enjoyed only by multinationals. Consultancy firm London Economics estimates small businesses could save \u00a324 billion, or 3 per cent of UK GDP, through forming buying groups. Already there are a number of 'intelligent intermediaries' which are encouraging small businesses to form collectives. Companies such as GroupTrade will grow rich by rounding up small businesses like sheep and organising their orders. \u0095 In five years, the current software industry will be dead,' says Nick Harper, technical architect of Webgenerics - a leading e-business solution provider. 'Why buy a CD for \u00a3200 when you can pay 25p for an application over the web?' Harper is talking about Application Service Provider, possibly the biggest innovation in information technology. We will access all our software via the web instead of by a CD, which is out of date by the time you install it. The result will be increased efficiency for businesses, which won't have to pay for as many technical back-up staff or for software upgrades. The dream of teleworking will become a workable reality thanks to ASP. For Microsoft, it will mean a seismic shift and the mass closure of its CD pressing plants. \u0095 Vaccine specialist Cantab Pharmaceuticals is testing a vaccine that blocks the addictive effects of cocaine on humans. It reports that so far there have not been any adverse reactions. It is also in the first pre-clinical stages of formulating a drug to prevent nicotine addiction. At least five other companies are in the advanced stages of animal testing for antibody therapies against two of the most dangerous drugs around: angel dust (phencyclidine) and ice (methamphetamine). Addiction-cure drugs are here and will raise a host of ethical issues. They are being developed for addicts and are not considered to be a preventative measure - for now. \u0095 It's enough to make a humourless Vulcan come out in a wry smile: the science fiction of 'beaming' objects from place to place is now a reality - at least for particles of light. In 1993, a team of North American scientists backed by IBM discovered a way to use quantum mechanics for teleportation. Two years ago scientists succeeded in 'entangling' a photon - a quantum of electromagnetic radiation - one metre across a lab bench. The California Institute of Telechnology and the University of Wales in Bangor are leaders in this research, which could eventually usher in a new kind of hyper-intelligent internet using quantum theory to 'teleport' information around the globe. Beaming yourself out of a traffic jam straight to the beach is still a pipe-dream, however. \u0095 The internal combustion engine will soon be history - oil reserves will not sustain its voracious appetite. The race is on to get the hydrogen-powered fuel cell car on sale. Fuel cell cars emit only water from their exhausts. Vauxhall claims its Zafira model has a top speed of 87 mph and says its 209lb stainless steel tank holds 11lb of hydrogen,which allows you to drive 250 miles before a refill. Honda, DaimlerChrysler and Ford all have equivalent products. At present, mass-producing a fuel cell engine would cost \u00a320,000, compared with \u00a32,000 for a diesel one. Still a way to go, but cars run on fuel cells will be with us by 2004. \u0095 Stem cells have been described as life's magic cauldron. A human starts as one cell - a fertilised egg - and divides to several trillion. Some of these cells are stem cells, which go to form anything a human body might need. Two years ago scientists discovered how to make new stem cells. Neuro stem cell therapy is possibly where the most exciting possibilities lie. A dozen biotech companies are working in this field: one is ReNeuron, which says that in the next 10 years the therapy could reverse the effects of strokes, brain damage through road accidents, epilepsy and dementia. ReNeuron is set to enter clinical trials within two years. The biggest problem is that ethical concerns have forced politicians in the US to withdraw public money from these projects. In Britain, red tape blocks neuro stem cell therapy's path. \u0095 Additional research by Ruth Hallam",

      "body": "<p>We're all in therapy these days. Some of us still do it the old-fashioned way, lying down on a couch in front of a stranger and telling them our deepest and most private fears and desires. Everybody else just breathes in: it's in the air, the language, the media, burrowed deeply into our culture and touching every aspect of our lives. It is even replacing religion, according to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who recently complained that Christ the Saviour had become Christ the Counsellor.</p> <p>Psychotherapy is only 100 years old, but in that time, it has grown from a controversial, marginal treatment for the 'mad' into a multimillion pound industry incorporating more than 400 different kinds of therapy, treating everything from personality disorders to weight loss.</p> <p>Since the 80s in particular, Britain has been in the grip of a therapy boom. Reliable figures are hard to find - as well as 400 kinds of therapy, there are at least 75 different training organisations - but if we take 'therapy' to include psychiatry, psychology, psychotherapy and counselling, hundreds of thousands have had some sort of treatment. And 51 per cent of GPs' surgeries now have some kind of therapist attached - up from 31 per cent just 10 years ago.</p> <p>But in spite of its apparent health, therapy is also in deep trouble, under attack both from within - the variety of the new therapies is one of its biggest problems, leading as it has to bitter political in-fighting over definitions of authenticity and legitimacy - and from a growing army of academics and doctors who question its most basic tenets. Increasingly, it is accused of causing the very problems it seeks to cure, encouraging isolated, self-absorbed individuals who only know how to look inwards. Writers such as David Smail and Philip Cushman have argued that there is too much emphasis on subjective truth, and not enough on the social and cultural forces that also shape our lives and cause our problems.</p> <p>As it re-groups and re-evaluates, therapy is having an identity crisis. Is it a way to treat psychological disorders? Or, with the advances in pharmacology and genetics, is it increasingly a tool for personal development? Is it a secular religion, helping us to understand the meaning of our existence? Does it aim to resolve our problems, or only to help us manage and accept them? How long should it last? And, at the heart of it all, the big question: does it even work?</p> <p>'It is an important question,' says Dr Giovanna di Ceglie, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst. 'But what do we mean by \"work\"? Each case is different. Each time, you have a different therapeutic aim. I had a patient who came to see me in distress, but when I asked him why he'd come, he replied that he honestly did not know. This man had a serious eating disorder - he was anorexic. He did not want to acknowledge this problem, and he refused to have it treated. He came to me because he wanted to alleviate his emotional pain without giving up his addiction to anorexia. So the therapeutic aim was to get him to acknowledge his illness and to get physical treatment for it. We worked together very slowly on his personality, his relationships and sexuality. It took five years for him to reach the point where he accepted my referral to a doctor who could deal with the issues of his weight, eating habits and diet. So we didn't cure his anorexia, but helped him to acknowledge his illness. Does that mean the therapy worked or didn't work?'</p> <p>For much of its history, psychotherapy had dismissed that question as unanswerable in any definitive sense. The subtle and intricate process of therapy could not be number-crunched or measured. 'Proof' came from patients' or therapists' own assessments, not from hard data or rigorous research. Climbing on to the couch was essentially an act of faith.</p> <p>Many claim to have been helped by therapy, but how have they been helped, and by how much? In 1952, psychologist Hans Eysenck discovered 'spontaneous remission', claiming that while around two-thirds of therapy patients improved over a two-year period, the same number of untreated patients showed the same improvements. Therapy did no harm, but it made no difference.</p> <p>Only recently have we begun systematically to research which treatments work for which problems - and which don't. The results so far are mixed, sometimes flawed, and rarely show long-term results. But Eysenck's work has been countered with many studies since, showing much better results for the therapy patients. In spite of its inherent flaws and failings, a body of real evidence for the efficacy of therapy is growing.</p> <p>Professor Peter Fonagy is one of the few therapists to have undertaken a serious, far- reaching review of psychotherapy research. His book, What Works for Whom?: A Critical Review of Psychotherapy Research (\u00a318.99, Guildford Press) co-written by Anthony Roth, reviews 50 years' worth of different kinds of studies and research, and is considered to be the definitive work of its kind. (It was published in 1996 and is currently being revised.) 'There are many problems in researching psychotherapy,' says Professor Fonagy. 'I don't entirely accept the old, purist argument that it can't be studied empirically, but I do understand it. There is a large element of creativity in therapy. A dozen therapists may belong to the same school of thought, yet practise very differently. How do you quantify the elements of a human relationship? Many therapists see their work as part medicine, part art. They liken research to a reduction: how do you measure how funny a joke is? Or how beautiful a painting? But we cannot hide behind this argument. We can and should be measurable and accountable. It will probably take another 10 years, but we are finally moving to Evidence Based Medicine (EBM).'</p> <p>His research uncovers substantial support for psychotherapy in treating a wide range of emotional problems. In fact, in many cases it is more effective than other medical interventions. 'The important point,' says Fonagy, 'is that there is no such thing as one size fits all in therapy. An acute anxiety-related problem can often be dealt with in some kind of brief, well-structured therapy. But a deeper problem requires longer treatment, and often a combination of drugs and therapy.' Problems like depression tend to respond around the 20th session of therapy, while more serious dysfunctions, such as personality disorders, will usually show improvements after six to 12 months. Patients who have had abusive or traumatic experiences can be difficult to treat 'if they have lost their trust. Therapy is based on trust, and it is hard for it to be effective without it.'</p> <p>For some specific problems, such as phobias and panic attacks, cognitive or behavioural therapy is most effective. There can be subtle differences of approach depending on the nature of the problem. 'Children with Attention Deficient Disorder (ADD) who have anxiety problems benefit most from a combined drug and therapy treatment. But if the child had ADD without anxiety, then there is no real role for therapy.' And the brave new world of drug treatments is to be welcomed, he says, but not regarded as a substitute for therapy. 'They both work, but they have very different approaches. What therapy aims to do is to restore equilibrium. When we lose our equilibrium, when we are distressed and unhappy, I believe that there is a deep human impulse to reach out for help to another human being. When you see news footage of disasters like the Columbine shooting, you always see the same image - of people with their arms outstretched, stumbling towards each other. Seeking therapy is a version of the same impulse.'</p> <p>Unlike many therapists and doctors, Professor Fonagy sees no innate superiority of either treatment. 'We find more and more that integrated approaches are very helpful. In some cases drugs are most effective, but perhaps not as many as you might think. For example, there are powerful drugs for treating children with aggression problems, but they have enormous side effects. It is much safer and just as effective to use Multi- Systemic Therapy - a very complex therapy where the therapist practically moves in, dealing with all the layers of social and emotional difficulty across the whole family.' This can have profound results 'but it is expensive and absolutely depends on finding a highly skilled, well-trained therapist.'</p> <p>Ah - the therapist. We may be getting much closer to discovering which therapies work for whom, but the success of any therapy is limited to the skill and ability of the practitioner. Who can define what makes a 'good therapist?' Most professionals cite proper and rigorous training as a fundamental, but that doesn't mean that all well- trained therapists are good ones. 'Broadly speaking, about two-thirds of therapy can be said to work and a third to fail,' says Fonagy. 'While certain kinds of therapies are better suited to certain kinds of problems, most of the failure comes, in my view, from a lack of skill on the part of the therapist.' 'Skill' in this sense seems to refer to something harder to define. 'Talent' is a better description, implying innate abilities such as perception, empathy and sincerity. Perhaps not surprising for a treatment based on a relationship, it seems to be human qualities that determine therapeutic excellence.</p> <p>David Smail, clinical psychologist and author of How to Survive without Psychotherapy , dismisses the emphasis on training in psychotherapy: 'Most of it is just ideological rubbish. Qualities of wisdom, experience, intelligence and empathy are far more important, and these aren't restricted to \"trained therapists\". We had \"therapy\" long before we had therapists or the therapy industry. Speaking openly and honestly to a concerned and interested person has always been therapeutic, but in the past we'd have talked to priests or family members or friends.' Giovanna di Ceglie only half-agrees. 'Certainly, those qualities are very important. But without training you are just listening, not understanding. Training provides the body of theories, models and knowledge - a structure for moving the patient forward.' Formally trained therapists are required to undergo years of analytical therapy themselves as part of the training process. 'This is crucial. Without it, you can't be sure that you aren't treating the patient from your own emotional agenda.'</p> <p>The issue of training - how much, for how long - is a cornerstone of therapy's current crisis. Psychotherapy has no central governing body, no regulation, no consistency of training or standards, no quality control. You can train for five years or five days and still call yourself a therapist. While some therapists are highly trained and evolved human beings, others are dangerous quacks. The potential for exploitation - in a close, intimate relationship in which the patient is, by definition, distressed and emotionally vulnerable - is enormous.</p> <p>Lord Alderdice, who practised as a psychiatrist and psychotherapist in Northern Ireland, has brought forward a Private Member's Bill in the House of Lords, proposing a central governing body to regulate the whole field. Why it has taken 100 years is anybody's guess. 'It's quite scandalous in my view that patients don't have the protection of a properly regulated system. There are a lot of people practising who aren't properly trained, and some of them are downright dangerous. A bad therapist can be far worse than no therapist at all. I know, because I've sometimes had to take some of their patients in for treatment.' The Bill has had its first reading, and is now being submitted to further discussion and amendments. 'Psychotherapy is a wide field. We want to allow diversity, but apply standardised rules and regulations. It will take time, but this is a process which is way overdue. Psychotherapy is a branch of medicine and it should be as monitored and regulated as any other.'</p> <p>If matching the right therapy and therapist to the patient are two prongs of what makes therapy work, the patients themselves are the third. Many therapists, and therapy texts, stress the importance of the 'fit' or 'working alliance' between practitioner and patient. In simple terms, this means they like and respect each other enough to commit to working together. A good therapist will refer a patient they don't like or feel they can't relate to, while a good patient will pay attention to any warning signals, such as feeling uncomfortable, disregarded or bullied.</p> <p>Signs that the therapy will be successful are often apparent at the earliest sessions. 'When I think about my own failures, they have usually been failures of engagement,' admits di Ceglie. All therapy has a high early drop-out rate, so engagement is crucial. If they stay for 26 sessions, about 75 per cent of patients are estimated to improve.</p> <p>But even with a good therapist, an appropriate therapy and a good 'fit', a good outcome is not guaranteed. Some people just tend to do better in therapy than others. There is a known correlation between IQ and response, according to Peter Fonagy, while motivated, committed and self-aware patients - surprise, surprise - do best of all. These are also the patients most likely to be better educated about what therapy is, and to have the most realistic expectations.</p> <p>Some patients, for example, go into psychotherapy because they want advice and guidance from the therapist, but the therapy they have chosen may be analytical or exploratory. This feeds the common charge against therapy that it works best for the middle classes. But that ignores the ever- growing number of NHS clinics where all classes and groups are treated. Lower-income patients may have a higher drop-out rate but, where they remain in treatment, results are about the same. Individuals who over-intellectualise the process, who are unwilling to 'let go', who conceal or deny their true feelings and experiences, or who expect to have all the work done for them by the therapist, don't benefit.</p> <p>Freud's basic premise still governs most (though certainly not all) of psychotherapy: our early experiences shape our personalities, our feelings affect the way we think, behave and relate to other people, and we are all subject to unconscious psychological forces. Therapy lets us access our unconscious and make sense of our emotions and experiences. Once we know ourselves, we can change ourselves - or at least, we can't change if we don't know ourselves. Therapy's ultimate promise is something ever-increasing amounts of us are seeking with ever-increasing enthusiasm: personal transformation. And all of this is achieved by sitting in a quiet room, and just talking.</p> <p>While research has proved its point for the emotionally disturbed, we still debate the role of therapy for 'personal development', for those we sneeringly dismiss as 'the worried well'. But Giovanna di Cegli, doesn't accept that one group of humans is more deserving of therapy than another. 'Why draw a distinction between the emotionally disturbed and those who come for apparently \"lesser\" problems, such as relationship difficulties or feeling stuck at work? While we may judge that these problems are not so severe, they can cause us enormous difficulties and distress. Sometimes they mask other emotional issues. It is not self- indulgence to try to clarify and understand these things. Therapy is often difficult, expensive and painful. Why would you accept all of that if you didn't need to?' Therapy may be the last place where we can seriously ponder the meaning not just of our lives but of life itself. You don't have to be sick, or self-indulgent, for that to be a serious and worthwhile pursuit.</p> <p>'Psychotherapy can help pragmatically with specific problems and difficulties,' adds Peter Fonagy, 'but beyond that, what it gives you is a way to understand yourself and others. And while nobody can ignore the problems and failings of therapy itself, I believe that its legacy is benign.</p> <p>'Compare our world after 100 years of psychotherapy. Our attitudes to our penal and psychiatric institutions have been transformed. We understand now that crime and criminals can have psychological reasons, and the importance of children's development. Sometimes we forget that these are radical ideas which are slowly creating a more humane and emotionally literate society. I believe we will gradually move away from only treating emotional problems to preventing them. That will be the new challenge for psychotherapy.'</p> <p>Even as it struggles to clean up its act with regulation, research and accountability, it's easy to be cynical about therapy. The arguments against its theories and practice are compelling - many of them apply at least in part to most therapies. But lined up against them are the men and women who went into that quiet room and came out feeling more whole, able to be better parents, lovers, friends or workers.</p> <p>'Good' therapy has been difficult to describe or define, but don't think it doesn't exist. In a world of watered-down psychobabble, the real thing can still have transformative effects.</p> <p><b>Types of psychotherapy</b></p> <p>There are three main schools of thought: psychoanalysis, cognitive therapy and humanistic therapy.</p> <p><b> Psychoanalysis</b> Based on the work of Freud, the essence of psychoanalysis is that people's problems stem from traumatic childhood events. Patients talk about themselves while the therapist listens and says very little. It aims to bring about a patient's greater understanding of themselves, and is less oriented towards change than other psychotherapies. Treatment can take years, and patients meet their therapist as frequently as every day, though once or twice a week is more usual.</p> <p><b> Cognitive therapy</b> This works on the basis that emotions can be the product of particular thought processes. It involves talking about the connections between ideas and feelings with an emphasis on unrealistic thoughts, and focuses on the present rather than the past. Patients often carry out 'homework' between sessions and keep a diary. The length of treatment is negotiated at the beginning. The initial period is usually 10 weekly sessions.</p> <p><b> Humanistic therapy</b> Better known as 'counselling', it is based on the theory that people need supportive therapy to encourage them to face problems. The duration of treatment is negotiated at the start: 10 sessions is usual. The counsellor encourages the patient to think about familiar situations in a different way, or prompts the patient to reassess problems.</p> <p><b>Finding a therapist</b></p> <p>Do some research. There are innumerable types of therapy and therapists, and the better informed you are, the more appropriate your decision will be. Libraries and the specialist organisations mentioned below are good places to start.</p> <p>Ask your GP for a referral. There are all kinds of therapists available on the NHS, but priority is given to the most serious cases. Waiting lists may be long, and the number of sessions may be limited. Your GP can also make private referrals.</p> <p>Ask friends to recommend somebody. Many people find a therapist through personal recommendations, but remember the importance of 'fit'.</p> <p>Make sure your therapist is properly trained. Psychoanalytical psychotherapists should be accredited by either the British Confederation of Psychotherapists (BCP) or the UK Confederation of Psychotherapists.</p> <p>Most private therapy sessions last one hour (50 minutes for psychoanalysts) and costs vary enormously depending on the kind of therapy you are having, the skill and experience of your therapist. Expect to pay between \u00a330 and \u00a350 per session.</p> <p>The BCP publishes a register of psychotherapists (available in libraries or, for \u00a330, from: The British Confederation of Psychotherapists, 37 Mapesbury Road, London NW2 4HJ).

      "bodyText": "We're all in therapy these days. Some of us still do it the old-fashioned way, lying down on a couch in front of a stranger and telling them our deepest and most private fears and desires. Everybody else just breathes in: it's in the air, the language, the media, burrowed deeply into our culture and touching every aspect of our lives. It is even replacing religion, according to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who recently complained that Christ the Saviour had become Christ the Counsellor. Psychotherapy is only 100 years old, but in that time, it has grown from a controversial, marginal treatment for the 'mad' into a multimillion pound industry incorporating more than 400 different kinds of therapy, treating everything from personality disorders to weight loss. Since the 80s in particular, Britain has been in the grip of a therapy boom. Reliable figures are hard to find - as well as 400 kinds of therapy, there are at least 75 different training organisations - but if we take 'therapy' to include psychiatry, psychology, psychotherapy and counselling, hundreds of thousands have had some sort of treatment. And 51 per cent of GPs' surgeries now have some kind of therapist attached - up from 31 per cent just 10 years ago. But in spite of its apparent health, therapy is also in deep trouble, under attack both from within - the variety of the new therapies is one of its biggest problems, leading as it has to bitter political in-fighting over definitions of authenticity and legitimacy - and from a growing army of academics and doctors who question its most basic tenets. Increasingly, it is accused of causing the very problems it seeks to cure, encouraging isolated, self-absorbed individuals who only know how to look inwards. Writers such as David Smail and Philip Cushman have argued that there is too much emphasis on subjective truth, and not enough on the social and cultural forces that also shape our lives and cause our problems. As it re-groups and re-evaluates, therapy is having an identity crisis. Is it a way to treat psychological disorders? Or, with the advances in pharmacology and genetics, is it increasingly a tool for personal development? Is it a secular religion, helping us to understand the meaning of our existence? Does it aim to resolve our problems, or only to help us manage and accept them? How long should it last? And, at the heart of it all, the big question: does it even work? 'It is an important question,' says Dr Giovanna di Ceglie, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst. 'But what do we mean by \"work\"? Each case is different. Each time, you have a different therapeutic aim. I had a patient who came to see me in distress, but when I asked him why he'd come, he replied that he honestly did not know. This man had a serious eating disorder - he was anorexic. He did not want to acknowledge this problem, and he refused to have it treated. He came to me because he wanted to alleviate his emotional pain without giving up his addiction to anorexia. So the therapeutic aim was to get him to acknowledge his illness and to get physical treatment for it. We worked together very slowly on his personality, his relationships and sexuality. It took five years for him to reach the point where he accepted my referral to a doctor who could deal with the issues of his weight, eating habits and diet. So we didn't cure his anorexia, but helped him to acknowledge his illness. Does that mean the therapy worked or didn't work?' For much of its history, psychotherapy had dismissed that question as unanswerable in any definitive sense. The subtle and intricate process of therapy could not be number-crunched or measured. 'Proof' came from patients' or therapists' own assessments, not from hard data or rigorous research. Climbing on to the couch was essentially an act of faith. Many claim to have been helped by therapy, but how have they been helped, and by how much? In 1952, psychologist Hans Eysenck discovered 'spontaneous remission', claiming that while around two-thirds of therapy patients improved over a two-year period, the same number of untreated patients showed the same improvements. Therapy did no harm, but it made no difference. Only recently have we begun systematically to research which treatments work for which problems - and which don't. The results so far are mixed, sometimes flawed, and rarely show long-term results. But Eysenck's work has been countered with many studies since, showing much better results for the therapy patients. In spite of its inherent flaws and failings, a body of real evidence for the efficacy of therapy is growing. Professor Peter Fonagy is one of the few therapists to have undertaken a serious, far- reaching review of psychotherapy research. His book, What Works for Whom?: A Critical Review of Psychotherapy Research (\u00a318.99, Guildford Press) co-written by Anthony Roth, reviews 50 years' worth of different kinds of studies and research, and is considered to be the definitive work of its kind. (It was published in 1996 and is currently being revised.) 'There are many problems in researching psychotherapy,' says Professor Fonagy. 'I don't entirely accept the old, purist argument that it can't be studied empirically, but I do understand it. There is a large element of creativity in therapy. A dozen therapists may belong to the same school of thought, yet practise very differently. How do you quantify the elements of a human relationship? Many therapists see their work as part medicine, part art. They liken research to a reduction: how do you measure how funny a joke is? Or how beautiful a painting? But we cannot hide behind this argument. We can and should be measurable and accountable. It will probably take another 10 years, but we are finally moving to Evidence Based Medicine (EBM).' His research uncovers substantial support for psychotherapy in treating a wide range of emotional problems. In fact, in many cases it is more effective than other medical interventions. 'The important point,' says Fonagy, 'is that there is no such thing as one size fits all in therapy. An acute anxiety-related problem can often be dealt with in some kind of brief, well-structured therapy. But a deeper problem requires longer treatment, and often a combination of drugs and therapy.' Problems like depression tend to respond around the 20th session of therapy, while more serious dysfunctions, such as personality disorders, will usually show improvements after six to 12 months. Patients who have had abusive or traumatic experiences can be difficult to treat 'if they have lost their trust. Therapy is based on trust, and it is hard for it to be effective without it.' For some specific problems, such as phobias and panic attacks, cognitive or behavioural therapy is most effective. There can be subtle differences of approach depending on the nature of the problem. 'Children with Attention Deficient Disorder (ADD) who have anxiety problems benefit most from a combined drug and therapy treatment. But if the child had ADD without anxiety, then there is no real role for therapy.' And the brave new world of drug treatments is to be welcomed, he says, but not regarded as a substitute for therapy. 'They both work, but they have very different approaches. What therapy aims to do is to restore equilibrium. When we lose our equilibrium, when we are distressed and unhappy, I believe that there is a deep human impulse to reach out for help to another human being. When you see news footage of disasters like the Columbine shooting, you always see the same image - of people with their arms outstretched, stumbling towards each other. Seeking therapy is a version of the same impulse.' Unlike many therapists and doctors, Professor Fonagy sees no innate superiority of either treatment. 'We find more and more that integrated approaches are very helpful. In some cases drugs are most effective, but perhaps not as many as you might think. For example, there are powerful drugs for treating children with aggression problems, but they have enormous side effects. It is much safer and just as effective to use Multi- Systemic Therapy - a very complex therapy where the therapist practically moves in, dealing with all the layers of social and emotional difficulty across the whole family.' This can have profound results 'but it is expensive and absolutely depends on finding a highly skilled, well-trained therapist.' Ah - the therapist. We may be getting much closer to discovering which therapies work for whom, but the success of any therapy is limited to the skill and ability of the practitioner. Who can define what makes a 'good therapist?' Most professionals cite proper and rigorous training as a fundamental, but that doesn't mean that all well- trained therapists are good ones. 'Broadly speaking, about two-thirds of therapy can be said to work and a third to fail,' says Fonagy. 'While certain kinds of therapies are better suited to certain kinds of problems, most of the failure comes, in my view, from a lack of skill on the part of the therapist.' 'Skill' in this sense seems to refer to something harder to define. 'Talent' is a better description, implying innate abilities such as perception, empathy and sincerity. Perhaps not surprising for a treatment based on a relationship, it seems to be human qualities that determine therapeutic excellence. David Smail, clinical psychologist and author of How to Survive without Psychotherapy , dismisses the emphasis on training in psychotherapy: 'Most of it is just ideological rubbish. Qualities of wisdom, experience, intelligence and empathy are far more important, and these aren't restricted to \"trained therapists\". We had \"therapy\" long before we had therapists or the therapy industry. Speaking openly and honestly to a concerned and interested person has always been therapeutic, but in the past we'd have talked to priests or family members or friends.' Giovanna di Ceglie only half-agrees. 'Certainly, those qualities are very important. But without training you are just listening, not understanding. Training provides the body of theories, models and knowledge - a structure for moving the patient forward.' Formally trained therapists are required to undergo years of analytical therapy themselves as part of the training process. 'This is crucial. Without it, you can't be sure that you aren't treating the patient from your own emotional agenda.' The issue of training - how much, for how long - is a cornerstone of therapy's current crisis. Psychotherapy has no central governing body, no regulation, no consistency of training or standards, no quality control. You can train for five years or five days and still call yourself a therapist. While some therapists are highly trained and evolved human beings, others are dangerous quacks. The potential for exploitation - in a close, intimate relationship in which the patient is, by definition, distressed and emotionally vulnerable - is enormous. Lord Alderdice, who practised as a psychiatrist and psychotherapist in Northern Ireland, has brought forward a Private Member's Bill in the House of Lords, proposing a central governing body to regulate the whole field. Why it has taken 100 years is anybody's guess. 'It's quite scandalous in my view that patients don't have the protection of a properly regulated system. There are a lot of people practising who aren't properly trained, and some of them are downright dangerous. A bad therapist can be far worse than no therapist at all. I know, because I've sometimes had to take some of their patients in for treatment.' The Bill has had its first reading, and is now being submitted to further discussion and amendments. 'Psychotherapy is a wide field. We want to allow diversity, but apply standardised rules and regulations. It will take time, but this is a process which is way overdue. Psychotherapy is a branch of medicine and it should be as monitored and regulated as any other.' If matching the right therapy and therapist to the patient are two prongs of what makes therapy work, the patients themselves are the third. Many therapists, and therapy texts, stress the importance of the 'fit' or 'working alliance' between practitioner and patient. In simple terms, this means they like and respect each other enough to commit to working together. A good therapist will refer a patient they don't like or feel they can't relate to, while a good patient will pay attention to any warning signals, such as feeling uncomfortable, disregarded or bullied. Signs that the therapy will be successful are often apparent at the earliest sessions. 'When I think about my own failures, they have usually been failures of engagement,' admits di Ceglie. All therapy has a high early drop-out rate, so engagement is crucial. If they stay for 26 sessions, about 75 per cent of patients are estimated to improve. But even with a good therapist, an appropriate therapy and a good 'fit', a good outcome is not guaranteed. Some people just tend to do better in therapy than others. There is a known correlation between IQ and response, according to Peter Fonagy, while motivated, committed and self-aware patients - surprise, surprise - do best of all. These are also the patients most likely to be better educated about what therapy is, and to have the most realistic expectations. Some patients, for example, go into psychotherapy because they want advice and guidance from the therapist, but the therapy they have chosen may be analytical or exploratory. This feeds the common charge against therapy that it works best for the middle classes. But that ignores the ever- growing number of NHS clinics where all classes and groups are treated. Lower-income patients may have a higher drop-out rate but, where they remain in treatment, results are about the same. Individuals who over-intellectualise the process, who are unwilling to 'let go', who conceal or deny their true feelings and experiences, or who expect to have all the work done for them by the therapist, don't benefit. Freud's basic premise still governs most (though certainly not all) of psychotherapy: our early experiences shape our personalities, our feelings affect the way we think, behave and relate to other people, and we are all subject to unconscious psychological forces. Therapy lets us access our unconscious and make sense of our emotions and experiences. Once we know ourselves, we can change ourselves - or at least, we can't change if we don't know ourselves. Therapy's ultimate promise is something ever-increasing amounts of us are seeking with ever-increasing enthusiasm: personal transformation. And all of this is achieved by sitting in a quiet room, and just talking. While research has proved its point for the emotionally disturbed, we still debate the role of therapy for 'personal development', for those we sneeringly dismiss as 'the worried well'. But Giovanna di Cegli, doesn't accept that one group of humans is more deserving of therapy than another. 'Why draw a distinction between the emotionally disturbed and those who come for apparently \"lesser\" problems, such as relationship difficulties or feeling stuck at work? While we may judge that these problems are not so severe, they can cause us enormous difficulties and distress. Sometimes they mask other emotional issues. It is not self- indulgence to try to clarify and understand these things. Therapy is often difficult, expensive and painful. Why would you accept all of that if you didn't need to?' Therapy may be the last place where we can seriously ponder the meaning not just of our lives but of life itself. You don't have to be sick, or self-indulgent, for that to be a serious and worthwhile pursuit. 'Psychotherapy can help pragmatically with specific problems and difficulties,' adds Peter Fonagy, 'but beyond that, what it gives you is a way to understand yourself and others. And while nobody can ignore the problems and failings of therapy itself, I believe that its legacy is benign. 'Compare our world after 100 years of psychotherapy. Our attitudes to our penal and psychiatric institutions have been transformed. We understand now that crime and criminals can have psychological reasons, and the importance of children's development. Sometimes we forget that these are radical ideas which are slowly creating a more humane and emotionally literate society. I believe we will gradually move away from only treating emotional problems to preventing them. That will be the new challenge for psychotherapy.' Even as it struggles to clean up its act with regulation, research and accountability, it's easy to be cynical about therapy. The arguments against its theories and practice are compelling - many of them apply at least in part to most therapies. But lined up against them are the men and women who went into that quiet room and came out feeling more whole, able to be better parents, lovers, friends or workers. 'Good' therapy has been difficult to describe or define, but don't think it doesn't exist. In a world of watered-down psychobabble, the real thing can still have transformative effects. Types of psychotherapy There are three main schools of thought: psychoanalysis, cognitive therapy and humanistic therapy. Psychoanalysis Based on the work of Freud, the essence of psychoanalysis is that people's problems stem from traumatic childhood events. Patients talk about themselves while the therapist listens and says very little. It aims to bring about a patient's greater understanding of themselves, and is less oriented towards change than other psychotherapies. Treatment can take years, and patients meet their therapist as frequently as every day, though once or twice a week is more usual. Cognitive therapy This works on the basis that emotions can be the product of particular thought processes. It involves talking about the connections between ideas and feelings with an emphasis on unrealistic thoughts, and focuses on the present rather than the past. Patients often carry out 'homework' between sessions and keep a diary. The length of treatment is negotiated at the beginning. The initial period is usually 10 weekly sessions. Humanistic therapy Better known as 'counselling', it is based on the theory that people need supportive therapy to encourage them to face problems. The duration of treatment is negotiated at the start: 10 sessions is usual. The counsellor encourages the patient to think about familiar situations in a different way, or prompts the patient to reassess problems. Finding a therapist Do some research. There are innumerable types of therapy and therapists, and the better informed you are, the more appropriate your decision will be. Libraries and the specialist organisations mentioned below are good places to start. Ask your GP for a referral. There are all kinds of therapists available on the NHS, but priority is given to the most serious cases. Waiting lists may be long, and the number of sessions may be limited. Your GP can also make private referrals. Ask friends to recommend somebody. Many people find a therapist through personal recommendations, but remember the importance of 'fit'. Make sure your therapist is properly trained. Psychoanalytical psychotherapists should be accredited by either the British Confederation of Psychotherapists (BCP) or the UK Confederation of Psychotherapists. Most private therapy sessions last one hour (50 minutes for psychoanalysts) and costs vary enormously depending on the kind of therapy you are having, the skill and experience of your therapist. Expect to pay between \u00a330 and \u00a350 per session. The BCP publishes a register of psychotherapists (available in libraries or, for \u00a330, from: The British Confederation of Psychotherapists, 37 Mapesbury Road, London NW2 4HJ). For further information, call 020 8830 5173 or go to their website, www.bps.org.uk. Also available from the BCP are two free pamphlets: Finding a Therapist and Psychoanalytical Psychotherapy .

They were set up by Roger Fry, alongside other Bloomsbury friends, the painters Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant.

More than 80 years later, with stores such as Habitat, Heals, The Pier and Purves &amp; Purves on Tottenham Court Road, the area is a mecca for shoppers in search of furniture, sofas, kitchenware and trinkets for the home. But in the past month, the spirit of Bell and Grant has been revived in a corner of Charlotte Street, not far from the location of the Omega Workshops.</p> <p>Charlotte Street is the latest venture by Tim and Kit Kemp, the entrepreneur/ interior designer husband and wife team who, since 1985, have been quietly building up an empire of six 'boutique' hotels across London, including the Covent Garden Hotel, favoured by the film/fashion/ celebrity set long before New York hotelier Ian Schrager's hip hotels opened. In fact, Schrager, along with Philippe Starck and his team, shacked up in the Covent Garden while in London working on their own hotels. Christina Ricci moved in for six months while she was filming Sleepy Hollow . And over the years, regular guests at the Kemp hotels have included Giorgio Armani, Calvin Klein, Isaac Mizrahi, Linda Evangelista, Helena Christensen, Kathleen Turner and Jeanne Moreau.</p> <p>The property on Charlotte Street - an impressive 1888 building which was last used as a dental warehouse - was spotted by the couple two years ago, and has been given the Kemp treatment over the past 18 months. Its doors opened in July, without any fanfare. Instead, Meg Ryan has made the odd impromptu appearance, simply wandering in off the street for a coffee at the brasserie, and an American film director took a residency for a few weeks in one of the hotel's two penthouses.</p> <p>The starting point for Kit Kemp's interior design came from the Bloomsbury style and the Omega Workshops. In the brasserie, there is a mural, painted in the style of some 1916 frescoes entitled Scenes of Contemporary London Life by Roger Fry and his Omega colleagues for a client at a smart Berkeley Street address. Kemp commissioned a work in homage to it, with the London of 2000 as his inspiration. The people in the mural are chatting into mobile phones, and wearing jeans and trainers. It wraps around the brasserie, giving the place a life and vibrancy even when it is empty. This is typical Kemp. She knows how to take a reference from the past and make it fresh and of the moment. Instead of shipping in a team of set builders and stylists to recreate Charleston, the Sussex home of Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, Kemp has simply sprinkled the place with the Bloomsbury influence, with specially commissioned wallpaper, printed with a detail from an Omega woodprint, the odd piece of hand-painted furniture, and a collection of paintings and woodcuts, including work by Vanessa Bell, Duncan Grant, Roger Fry and Henry Lamb.</p> <p>Kemp spent a large chunk of the budget on the art collection, and it is what gives the hotel a more intimate, personal appeal. Wander into the spacious lobby, and the first thing you see is a 1967 sculpture by Lyn Chadwick on loan by the artist, who is also a friend of the Kemps'. There are also two abstract landscapes by the Wales-based painter Roger Cecil. A larger-than-life plaster ram's head watches over the comings and goings - a find at one of Kemp's favourite shops, Talisman Antiques in Dorset. In the smaller of two lounges, there are fat, squidgy sofas, where you can sit and admire the Roger Fry still life of flowers, the Henry Lamb line drawing, and the charmingly child-like flower painting by Winifred Nicholson. Kemp found it at the Art 2000 fair in north London, and couldn't resist splashing out \u00a310,000 for it.</p> <p>The artworks look quite at home in the lounge, alongside a series of framed dry herbs, found by Kit on her travels in France, and the Bloomsbury-style standard lamp with painted shade. In the bigger lounge, which looks out over Rathbone Street, there is work by Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, and a more contemporary painting of beach huts by Keith Purser.</p> <p>'The art was the starting point for the interiors,' says Kemp. 'I didn't want to do a pastiche on the past. It had to look cooler, airy and modern. The art works within it.' The theme is carried through into the 52 bedrooms, each of which is decorated in a different style. Room 500 has an African theme, with giraffe-print sofas and wood prints from the Hogarth Press. Another room is decorated in pink, with embroidered tulips. Each room has its own little gem, be it artwork or hand-made furniture. 'It's good to mix a modern feel with older objects,' says Kemp, who knows a good hotel when she stays in one. She has just returned from the Hotel du Palais Biarritz, which was built for Eugenie by Napoleon. Two other favourites are the Posta Vecchia near Rome, a Renaissance palazzo which became a hotel after J Paul Getty, who furnished and lived in it, sold it, lock stock and marble fireplace, in the 70s. 'They have a vegetable garden,' says Kemp, 'and guests eat whatever is in season.'</p> <p>It's all about the personal touch. In 1985, when the Kemps opened their first hotel, the chintzy, homely Dorset Square, and the capital's first country-house hotel, such places were still a novelty in London. The discerning business traveller had to make do with the older, more traditional hotels. 'Hotels were so stereotyped then - all cellophane-packed, not individual at all. We wanted to put a bit of adventure back into the hotel.' Since then, London has sprouted enough posh and stylish hotels to rival New York, with the Metropolitan, the Hempel, the Sanderson and St Martins Lane, One Aldwych, My Hotel off Tottenham Court Road, and Terence Conran's recent Great Eastern Hotel in Liverpool Street. And there is the Kemps's own empire, including the Pelham in South Kensington, and Durley House in Sloane Street. Already, they are working on their next venture, 16 Sumner Place in South Kensington, which promises to provide chic b&amp;b and a gorgeous garden for the stylish traveller spending their own money. This autumn, Kit will also put the finishing touches to their new restaurant in Westbourne Park Road.</p> <p>'People are more sophisticated now,' she says. 'They read magazines like Departures and Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller and they don't want to have a mass-produced experience.' And with Charlotte Street, Kit Kemp has created an environment in which Virginia Woolf herself might have felt at home.</p> <p>\u0095 Charlotte Street Hotel, 15 Charlotte Street, London W1 (020 7907 4000)</p>",

Two other favourites are the Posta Vecchia near Rome, a Renaissance palazzo which became a hotel after J Paul Getty, who furnished and lived in it, sold it, lock stock and marble fireplace, in the 70s. 'They have a vegetable garden,' says Kemp, 'and guests eat whatever is in season.' It's all about the personal touch. In 1985, when the Kemps opened their first hotel, the chintzy, homely Dorset Square, and the capital's first country-house hotel, such places were still a novelty in London. The discerning business traveller had to make do with the older, more traditional hotels. 'Hotels were so stereotyped then - all cellophane-packed, not individual at all. We wanted to put a bit of adventure back into the hotel.' Since then, London has sprouted enough posh and stylish hotels to rival New York, with the Metropolitan, the Hempel, the Sanderson and St Martins Lane, One Aldwych, My Hotel off Tottenham Court Road, and Terence Conran's recent Great Eastern Hotel in Liverpool Street. And there is the Kemps's own empire, including the Pelham in South Kensington, and Durley House in Sloane Street. Already, they are working on their next venture, 16 Sumner Place in South Kensington, which promises to provide chic b&amp;b and a gorgeous garden for the stylish traveller spending their own money. This autumn, Kit will also put the finishing touches to their new restaurant in Westbourne Park Road. 'People are more sophisticated now,' she says. 'They read magazines like Departures and Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller and they don't want to have a mass-produced experience.' And with Charlotte Street, Kit Kemp has created an environment in which Virginia Woolf herself might have felt at home. \u0095 Charlotte Street Hotel, 15 Charlotte Street, London W1 (020 7907 4000)",

We wriggled towards each other like a pair of earthworms. I didn't even know who I was wriggling towards, so there must have been some gravitational pull. I felt immediately in sympathy with her. <p> I suppose one does tend towards one's own kind. I can't smoke any more, but I have no intention of giving up friends who do. As for sex, that doesn't figure much now either, but I've always got on well with lesbians. I was completely gay until I was 22 and bisexual after that, so I feel more at home with people who deviate. I doubt that anything could change my feelings towards Maggi. I get a glow whenever I know I'm going to see her. It's a sort of fix.</p> <p> And I admire her paintings very much, which makes a difference. We don't agree on everything. I love the Pre-Raphaelites, she hates them. I respect her honesty. Maggi never prevaricates. </p> <p> The one big thing we have in common is a love of Vaudeville. Maggi would have liked to be in it and I am. I try out my jokes on her first and she'll save jokes for me. If I tried a joke on her and she didn't laugh, I'd suspect it wasn't a very good one. </p> <p> Maggi is less promiscuously friendly than I am and I sometimes think it's a failure on my part that I have so few enemies. It was during the Channel 4 quiz game in the 80s that we really got to know each other well. There was me, Maggi and Frank Whitford, the 'straight' man. We did 10 shows in five days and weren't sober once. A man came up to me at a party afterwards and shouted: 'Stop interfering with Maggi. She's a painter and you're turning her into a performer!' </p> <p> On one session, she arrived wearing a moustache, to keep her end up, and the next day she came in a gold lam\u00e9 dress and Joan Collins make-up. </p> <p> There's a marvellous portrait of me by Maggi in the National Portrait Gallery. If I'm ever having trouble getting a taxi in central London, I take comfort from the fact that there is a part of me sitting comfortably 200 yards away. </p> <p> She gets me into some quite difficult poses for a stiff, elderly man. When she's painting, you see Maggi popping out from behind the easel like an escaped mink. We went on a programme together to talk about one portrait and discovered Michael Winner there. It may have been the fact that he's got hair, that provoked Maggi into shaving hers off immediately afterwards, though in fact I think it suits her. I love the shape of her skull and her eyes are full of languorous beauty, but with something of the bird of prey about them. </p> <p> <b> Maggi Hambling:</b> George might not have known who he was wriggling towards, but I knew who he was. He'd just written a piece about my being the first artist in residence at the National Gallery and he'd got some of it wrong. So I decided that would be a good moment to tell him. </p> <p> It's George's quality of being both sexes, on and off the stage, that appeals to me. I don't choose friends. George just happened. The thought of him makes me feel better. George is a big person, not just physically. It's his spirit, his mind, his wit and generosity. I look forward to the large presence arriving at the door, his stomach half an hour before the rest of him. </p> <p> If I've painted George over life-size, that's what he is [her latest portrait is on show at Marlborough Fine Art, London]. He moves me and there's a serendipity between us. Recently, I was terribly upset about something. It was early one Sunday morning and I'd been crying. The phone went and George said: 'Are you all right, Maggi?' He'd dreamt that he was at a party. The others had left and I came into the room in tears. He'd dreamt it as it was happening. </p> <p> Wherever he is and whatever he's doing, George telephones every week to make sure we're both still here. That's a great reassurance. I try to help him by remembering jokes I've heard, but it's difficult to tell George a joke over the telephone. He doesn't hear too well, so you have to repeat every line, which puts a strain on the timing. But as long as he gets the punch line, that's the main thing. </p> <p> Work is a big part of our friendship. There's nothing sexier than George on stage and he understands what I'm trying to do in my work. He's always honest and he says when he doesn't like something. He's written very perceptively about my work and he sees things in it that I haven't. </p> <p> I'm not as gregarious as he is, but then I work on my own. People can eat you up. You have to keep them at bay. The art world isn't overburdened with a sense of humour. We both love drag. The great thing about George is that he's completely unshockable. We don't usually meet more than once a fortnight, but he's always there for me and that's what friendship is.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'Everyone loves you and everything's free/We're always the face everyone wants to see/Life goes by in a velvet rope blur/In through the back by the fire escape stairs/Everyone loves us and everything's free/Always in the place everyone wants to be' <br><strong>from Peakin' by Bleachin' </strong></p> <p> Jeremy Healy is a DJ. Ranked by fame, fortune or ability to attract paying customers through the door of a club, he's probably in the top 10 worldwide. He's a star, whose earnings for a good weekend run well into five figures. Under the name Bleachin', he has just released an album with his friend Amos Pizzey - one of those people everyone in London knows, even if few of them could say exactly what it is that Pizzey does. Bleachin' is an Afro-Caribbean term for serious partying, for going without sleep so long that your face turns white. It's also the name of the album's first track, the story of a nonstop three-night bender in Paris and London which the duo enjoyed two years ago. The first few copies of the album, Everyone Loves You, Everything's Free , come in a limited- edition, mirrored CD case complete with rolled-up note. As you may have guessed, it's about a certain lifestyle: about celebrity parties, guest lists and free champagne, about bright cocaine nights and the dark, empty comedowns that inevitably follow. For Pizzey especially, it's an intensely personal record. You could say he'd been researching it most of his life. </p> <p> Tuesday, 8.30am, Eurostar terminal at Waterloo. Pizzey is in his element. He has friends to entertain, strangers to charm, a party to organise. He's telling stories and jokes, cheerfully moving passengers around our first-class carriage so that we can all sit together, trying to persuade everyone to stay the night in Paris and go out. Meanwhile, he's on the mobile with his record label, trying to persuade them to hold the launch party for his album on a yacht in Ibiza. </p> <p>Annie Leibovitz is undertaking a marathon shoot for the September issue of US Vogue: 12 fashion designers with the friends who inspire them, shot in several countries over a period of 16 days. Pizzey, Trish Simenon and Annabelle Neilson are going to Paris to be photographed with John Galliano; Pizzey's girlfriend, the radio and TV presenter Lisa I'Anson, has come along to shop; I'm just there for the ride. </p> <p>From the Gare du Nord, a limo whisks us to the opulent restaurant where the shoot is to take place. An army of Vogue stylists and a rack of gorgeous Dior dresses is waiting. Galliano himself arrives straight from the airport at 5pm; Healy, who has provided the soundtrack to every catwalk show the designer has produced since his graduation, has flown in sleepless from Mallorca, where he has been playing all night at the vast BCM club; celebrity party organiser Fran Cutler and her sister Charlotte have come in from Ibiza, where they've been visiting Fran's business partner, Meg Mathews, at her home on the island. </p> <p>As they finally settle down for the shoot, they are asked to act like there's a party going on. It's no great stretch. Most of this group have known each other for years, and were there for Galliano when times were tough and his talent wasn't so richly rewarded. There's a lot of banter, a lot of loud laughter. Leibovitz takes just 30 minutes to capture an illusion of late-night glamour, and then the real night begins. Taxis arrive to transport everyone to rooms at the swish Hotel Costes, then there's an hour by the pool and dinner at a hip new Moroccan restaurant. Late that night, I get a taxi home. Reaching for the fare, I realise it's the first time I've paid for anything all day. </p> <p> Jeremy Healy was born in Peckham, south-east London 'a restless spirit, full of vague, unspoken ambitions'. On the bus to school, he'd met George O'Dowd, from the nearby suburb of Eltham. They began going out together, dressing up, becoming faces in the emerging club scene, living in squats and getting their photos in the new style magazines. Inevitably, they both joined bands. Healy's band, Haysi Fantayzee, got a record deal by making a cheap video and sending out a sheaf of promotional photographs, making them one of the first acts to realise the power that image was to play in the MTV decade. They hit the charts in July 1982 with the gloriously titled 'John Wayne Is Big Leggy'. O'Dowd's band, Culture Club, got its first hit single two months later, but proved to have rather more longevity. Healy, meanwhile, moved from making records to playing them, becoming a star DJ in the small, enclosed world that was 80s clubland. The elite got into clubs for free, drank cocktails in VIP rooms, enjoyed trips to New York, Japan, Ibiza. At the time, this seemed the height of sophistication but, like so much about the 80s, it proved to be just an over-dressed rehearsal for the decade to come. When the acid-house boom took club culture mainstream, going out dancing became something all kids did, not just the strangely dressed ones. Suddenly there were cool dance clubs in every town and city in Britain, and then across the globe. </p> <p>When the scene exploded, Healy employed his friend Fran Cutler, to organise his bookings for him. She went on to start one of the first DJ agencies and is one of the people credited by disgruntled promoters for raising DJ fees up into the stratosphere. Some time around 1993, Healy challenged Cutler to book him somewhere absurd, somewhere new, and she sent him to a club in Norway just by the Arctic Circle. It was then, he said, that he began to understand that he could take his records and get paid to go anywhere in the world. </p> <p> Friday, 9pm, Seven - the restaurant above Home nightclub in Leicester Square. Pizzey is holding court, as he does every Friday, before hosting the night at Home's members' bar on the floor above. He is entertaining the close friends on his table with the story of his doomed attempt to enjoy a quiet New Year's break in Thailand with I'Anson. (It involves various celebrities, plus a man with a gun, a helicopter, and things the libel laws wouldn't allow me to even hint at here.) The club pays Pizzey to host the night, to invite his friends along, have a few drinks and a few laughs. He's too diplomatic to mention it, but before he got involved, the place was dead. To kick it off, Pizzey set up a few parties for famous friends, peaking with an event for John Galliano that saw 1,400 people pass through the bar - including the reigning queen of the London party A-list, Madonna. 'After that,' he says casually, 'it was pretty much up and running.' </p> <p> Amos Pizzey was born in west London. His father, an ex-naval officer, worked in television. His mother, Erin, a diplomat's daughter, founded the first refuge for battered women in Chiswick, bringing the issue of domestic violence out into the open. After they divorced, his dad lived in a flat in the basement of their home with various girlfriends, while Erin unofficially fostered a group of young men Pizzey grew up regarding as his half-brothers. All of them were black, all older than him: 'They were my role models, which is where my cultural confusion stemmed from. I didn't know it, but I had real problems being white at that time.' </p> <p>His liberal parents told him he didn't have to go to school if he didn't want to. So he took his education instead in illegal shebeens, following reggae sound systems. By the time he was 13, he was performing himself, a white boy improvising on the mic in fluent patois. 'I was pretty wild,' he recalls. 'I couldn't write, but I couldn't half rock the mic!' </p> <p>His sister's boyfriend, Mickey Craig, had also moved into their household, and invited Pizzey to join his group, Culture Club. Pizzey worked with them under the alias Captain Crucial. He was 14 and the band was just on the verge of pop success when his mother dropped her bombshell: they were moving to New Mexico. 'The next thing I knew, I was in the desert in Santa Fe. A white kid with dreadlocks, surrounded by cowboys. Not a good move.' For years, Erin Pizzey's life had been a battle. Against the local authority about overcrowding at the refuge. Against feminists, who first celebrated her, then objected to her analysis of the causes of domestic violence. And finally against the legal system, when she refused to reveal the whereabouts of a woman and child she'd smuggled to safety in France. </p> <p>Pizzey remembers being in court with people like Spike Milligan who had taken up his mother's cause, watching her get sent to prison. She was eventually released, but decided to leave Britain. 'It was a bad period,' says Pizzey. 'I'm very proud of my mother. But it wasn't great, a lot of it. She was under a lot of pressure.' </p> <p>In the next few years, they moved across New Mexico, to the Caribbean and then to Italy. By the time he was 16 he was back in London alone, with a fierce self-belief that he says was his mother's gift to him. With his half-brother Cass (now in Skunk Anansie), he formed an abysmal band called Dark Star. They recorded one demo, a calypso version of 'My Girl', and signed a massive record deal. 'I loved the 80s,' laughs Pizzey. 'They gave us a quarter of a million quid. I was 17, Richard Branson took me out to lunch and said, \"You're it, you're going to be the thing.\"' </p> <p>Pizzey didn't have a driving licence, but he had a Jag. And suits with shoulder pads so wide he had to go through doors sideways. They spent two years in the studio, but the resulting album was predictably dire, and the group was dropped. 'If we'd been successful, I would have been such a wanker,' says Pizzey philosophically. 'I mean, I'm a wanker now, but I've got a sense of humour. Taking yourself seriously and being a wanker is a different thing: that's Mick Hucknall.' </p> <p>Undeterred, he formed a rock band with Ringo Starr's son Zak Starkey, and they were big in Japan for a while. By the time he returned to London, Ecstasy and house music had arrived, and Pizzey enthusiastically embraced the new scene. He'd known of Healy for years - Boy George had engineered a stand-off between the two over who had the most authentic dreadlocks - but finally they became friends, recording for O'Dowd's dance label More Protein. </p> <p>When Healy played in clubs, Pizzey would often come along to improvise on the mic over the records. It was on a club trip to Singapore and Bali with Healy at the start of the 90s that Pizzey met Melissa Ong, the woman he was to spend the next seven years of his life with. He took her to his swish hotel in Singapore to impress her; she laughed and told him that her father owned it. In fact, her family owns quite a few hotels, across the world. Along with a substantial oil business and a retail empire built around designer fashion. </p> <p>Although the 80s are often seen as the designer decade, the obsession with labels only became big business in the 90s, when entrepreneurs like the Ongs took an interest. At its peak, the company run by Melissa's mother Christina had the franchises to some 60 designer names including Armani, Prada, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein. She opened flagship stores for these labels across Asia, Australia - and, of course, in London, where she also opened the Metropolitan on Park Lane in 1997. A designer hotel very much in the mould set by Ian Schrager in New York, it had a small bar that the Ongs hoped would draw in hip Londoners as well as hotel guests. Since they wanted the bar to be exclusive, Pizzey advised them not to sell memberships. Instead, they gave them away. A thousand cards went out to carefully selected people, and the deluge began. </p> <p>'People are always going to fight if they can't get into something,' he shrugs. 'That's so London. It's just a small, red room, but the scenes that went on in there during the peak two years were just ridiculous.' </p> <p>For a while, it seemed that everyone who was anyone passed through the Met Bar. Fran Cutler and Meg Mathews hosted a night there. Models, actors, pop stars and their entourages partied there. 'It wasn't the celebrities, it was the people around them who started to fascinate me,' says Pizzey, explaining his inspiration for the Bleachin' album. 'They were all supposedly producers, directors, models, actors, but all they really did was bugle [cocaine] in the bar. But then you started to notice fall-out. Certain people would get rougher and rougher, their designer facade would slip and they'd end up hassling you for drugs. I found the whole period fascinating. It was the end of the century, there was an element of fiddling while Rome burns.' </p> <p> Monday, 7pm, yet another new cocktail bar, Zeta's, not far from the Met Bar. Pizzey is here with I'Anson, Healy with his Brazilian girlfriend Luciana Silva. We're meeting before the London Club and Bar Awards at the Hilton - a lavish, self-congratulatory affair that offers yet another illustration of how fast this industry has grown. It's being televised, so there's a short film clip before each award. Pizzey guides us on a tour of some of London's new bars before I'Anson comes on stage to present the Best Bar award to Piccadilly's 10 Rooms. Former EastEnders actor Sid Owen presents the Best Club award, reading out the list of nominees and announcing, 'I've been mashed in all of these places.' It goes to Fabric, and the lady who runs their VIP toilets steps up to collect it, joking that she's seen many of the audience lingering in her cubicles. </p> <p>Meanwhile, from the numbers shuttling to the toilets in groups, the hotel's staff could be forgiven for believing they were at a support night for the chronically weak- bladdered. </p> <p> There's another story to the Bleachin' album, one that is told in the final four tracks, where the titles are less celebratory: 'Comedown', 'Fragile', 'Ambulance' and 'Learn to Cry'. It's the story of the lows that always accompany chemical highs, of the many who lost their souls for a line of white powder. But more specifically, it's the story of Pizzey's nephew Keita. Pizzey's sister Cleo was 15 when Keita was born; the father, Mickey Craig, was two years older. Pizzey talks about Keita as a brother, or a son. 'We slept in the same bed because he got scared at night. I changed his nappies, and he always looked up to me 'way too much, I can see now.' </p> <p>Keita came to clubs when Pizzey performed, and had some talent as a rapper himself 'at one point, there was talk of him signing to Boy George's label. Like many clubbers, he got into Ecstasy. Unlike most, he started hearing voices. Gradually, the Pizzeys began to realise he was seriously ill, and discovered that paranoid schizophrenia ran in his father's side of the family. Pizzey spent a lot of time just talking to him, 'really out-there conversations when he'd hear voices talking to him in records and say me and him were here to fight aliens'. Pizzey got him into The Priory for a while, and Keita went through various NHS schemes without ever getting consistent help. Mostly the family was left trying to deal with his illness alone, his mother and grandmother taking turns to care for him. </p> <p>When he asked for money, Pizzey said he'd buy him food, clothes, anything he needed, but he wouldn't give him cash to buy drugs. One day Keita mugged an old lady. When he was chased, he ran to his own home and sat inside the front door, crying, until the police came. At the station, Keita said he was a danger to himself. The police followed procedure, putting him in a shared cell, checking on him every 15 minutes. But then he was transferred to Wandsworth Prison for the night and, by morning, he was dead - hanged in his cell with his laces. </p> <p>Pizzey blames himself for Keita's death. He didn't take drugs with his nephew, but he has never hidden the fact that he does take them. He thinks he's got away with a lot in his life, by being physically fit, by having good friends, by having places he could go to escape and clean out if it all got too much. He wonders if everyone will be as lucky. 'I think the drugs fallout will be massive over the next few generations, because we're doing shit that we've got no idea about.' </p> <p> Saturday, noon, The Dior couture show at L'\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris. On a balcony high in the roof, Healy is pacing about nervously. His music is playing: a simple four-note sequence repeated again and again, punctuated by the crack of a whip and a woman moaning in sexual ecstasy. Below, Steven Spielberg is sitting with his wife Kate Capshaw on one side, Elle Macpherson on the other, brilliantly managing to affect natural-looking conversations with both despite the photographers who surround them in an arc, flashbulbs popping. There's a hush as the show starts with a man in an ornate, feminine bishop's costume, followed by characters from a lavish, yet slightly sinister wedding. As each model moves along the catwalk, the music changes to match the mood. Healy has spent four days in Paris talking through the ideas with Galliano, making the music fit his themes of dysfunctional families and sexual transgression. The final mix includes dance beats, film soundtracks, a stream of obscenities by American performance artist Karen Finlay, and Beethoven's ninth symphony. As always, it's the most exciting music Healy makes. </p> <p>There was a point when he became a symbol of DJ excess. A couple of years ago, he began to slow down. He'd been depressed, he realised, and needed to start enjoying music again, enjoying his life. 'Money isn't everything. Unconsciously, I'd focused so much on my career - and I never thought I would even utter that word - that I was travelling all the time. If you're not around when people phone, after six months no one's going to call you. Success made me quite a lonely person.' Healy's daughter, Marley, was born in 1991. It wasn't something he'd planned, and it didn't make much difference to his life at first: 'I was never with the mother, never said I would be.' But then Marley's mum died. Suddenly, unexpectedly. (In the context of this feature, it seems relevant to say there were no drugs involved.) So Marley came to live with Healy for two days a week, and in their first year together, he finally became a father. 'To see the wonder in her eyes when I show her things is brilliant. It's lovely.' </p> <p>He recently moved into a new apartment in central London after spending months having it fitted to his specifications, yet he talks wistfully of a house he'd seen out in the suburbs, a big house with room for a swimming pool that he says would be lonely without a family to fill it. For now, though, Marley lives in Ibiza with her mother's best friend, who is bringing her up with her own children. Healy doesn't see her as much as he'd like, and he still seems surprised at how painful that is. 'I hope to take on more, to get closer and closer to her. It's difficult, because apart from the summer, I can go two or three months without seeing her, and that tends to hurt. You have to get to know them again, and it takes time to get to that place with them again. That idea of a family may be corny, but to not have that is a lot harder to deal with than to have it. And not to have your daughter with you when you want her to be_ That's one thing I haven't got, and it's about the only thing in my life that could have been worked better.' He pauses then laughs, almost embarrassed. 'But everything else has worked out quite good.' </p> <p> Saturday, 8pm. There's a car waiting at Waterloo. I drive with Healy to his new home. In two hours, he'll leave again to play at a club in Watford. Then it's back to London, where he'll DJ at another club until 5.30am. The next day, he'll fly to Mallorca for another all-nighter, followed by his weekly residency in Ibiza. There are far worse ways to make a living, of course, and Healy certainly isn't complaining. Nonetheless, it's a relentless schedule. Everybody loves you, nothing comes free.</p>",

      "bodyText": "'Everyone loves you and everything's free/We're always the face everyone wants to see/Life goes by in a velvet rope blur/In through the back by the fire escape stairs/Everyone loves us and everything's free/Always in the place everyone wants to be' from Peakin' by Bleachin' Jeremy Healy is a DJ. Ranked by fame, fortune or ability to attract paying customers through the door of a club, he's probably in the top 10 worldwide. He's a star, whose earnings for a good weekend run well into five figures. Under the name Bleachin', he has just released an album with his friend Amos Pizzey - one of those people everyone in London knows, even if few of them could say exactly what it is that Pizzey does. Bleachin' is an Afro-Caribbean term for serious partying, for going without sleep so long that your face turns white. It's also the name of the album's first track, the story of a nonstop three-night bender in Paris and London which the duo enjoyed two years ago. The first few copies of the album, Everyone Loves You, Everything's Free , come in a limited- edition, mirrored CD case complete with rolled-up note. As you may have guessed, it's about a certain lifestyle: about celebrity parties, guest lists and free champagne, about bright cocaine nights and the dark, empty comedowns that inevitably follow. For Pizzey especially, it's an intensely personal record. You could say he'd been researching it most of his life. Tuesday, 8.30am, Eurostar terminal at Waterloo. Pizzey is in his element. He has friends to entertain, strangers to charm, a party to organise. He's telling stories and jokes, cheerfully moving passengers around our first-class carriage so that we can all sit together, trying to persuade everyone to stay the night in Paris and go out. Meanwhile, he's on the mobile with his record label, trying to persuade them to hold the launch party for his album on a yacht in Ibiza. Annie Leibovitz is undertaking a marathon shoot for the September issue of US Vogue: 12 fashion designers with the friends who inspire them, shot in several countries over a period of 16 days. Pizzey, Trish Simenon and Annabelle Neilson are going to Paris to be photographed with John Galliano; Pizzey's girlfriend, the radio and TV presenter Lisa I'Anson, has come along to shop; I'm just there for the ride. From the Gare du Nord, a limo whisks us to the opulent restaurant where the shoot is to take place. An army of Vogue stylists and a rack of gorgeous Dior dresses is waiting. Galliano himself arrives straight from the airport at 5pm; Healy, who has provided the soundtrack to every catwalk show the designer has produced since his graduation, has flown in sleepless from Mallorca, where he has been playing all night at the vast BCM club; celebrity party organiser Fran Cutler and her sister Charlotte have come in from Ibiza, where they've been visiting Fran's business partner, Meg Mathews, at her home on the island. As they finally settle down for the shoot, they are asked to act like there's a party going on. It's no great stretch. Most of this group have known each other for years, and were there for Galliano when times were tough and his talent wasn't so richly rewarded. There's a lot of banter, a lot of loud laughter. Leibovitz takes just 30 minutes to capture an illusion of late-night glamour, and then the real night begins. Taxis arrive to transport everyone to rooms at the swish Hotel Costes, then there's an hour by the pool and dinner at a hip new Moroccan restaurant. Late that night, I get a taxi home. Reaching for the fare, I realise it's the first time I've paid for anything all day. Jeremy Healy was born in Peckham, south-east London 'a restless spirit, full of vague, unspoken ambitions'. On the bus to school, he'd met George O'Dowd, from the nearby suburb of Eltham. They began going out together, dressing up, becoming faces in the emerging club scene, living in squats and getting their photos in the new style magazines. Inevitably, they both joined bands. Healy's band, Haysi Fantayzee, got a record deal by making a cheap video and sending out a sheaf of promotional photographs, making them one of the first acts to realise the power that image was to play in the MTV decade. They hit the charts in July 1982 with the gloriously titled 'John Wayne Is Big Leggy'. O'Dowd's band, Culture Club, got its first hit single two months later, but proved to have rather more longevity. Healy, meanwhile, moved from making records to playing them, becoming a star DJ in the small, enclosed world that was 80s clubland. The elite got into clubs for free, drank cocktails in VIP rooms, enjoyed trips to New York, Japan, Ibiza. At the time, this seemed the height of sophistication but, like so much about the 80s, it proved to be just an over-dressed rehearsal for the decade to come. When the acid-house boom took club culture mainstream, going out dancing became something all kids did, not just the strangely dressed ones. Suddenly there were cool dance clubs in every town and city in Britain, and then across the globe. When the scene exploded, Healy employed his friend Fran Cutler, to organise his bookings for him. She went on to start one of the first DJ agencies and is one of the people credited by disgruntled promoters for raising DJ fees up into the stratosphere. Some time around 1993, Healy challenged Cutler to book him somewhere absurd, somewhere new, and she sent him to a club in Norway just by the Arctic Circle. It was then, he said, that he began to understand that he could take his records and get paid to go anywhere in the world. Friday, 9pm, Seven - the restaurant above Home nightclub in Leicester Square. Pizzey is holding court, as he does every Friday, before hosting the night at Home's members' bar on the floor above. He is entertaining the close friends on his table with the story of his doomed attempt to enjoy a quiet New Year's break in Thailand with I'Anson. (It involves various celebrities, plus a man with a gun, a helicopter, and things the libel laws wouldn't allow me to even hint at here.) The club pays Pizzey to host the night, to invite his friends along, have a few drinks and a few laughs. He's too diplomatic to mention it, but before he got involved, the place was dead. To kick it off, Pizzey set up a few parties for famous friends, peaking with an event for John Galliano that saw 1,400 people pass through the bar - including the reigning queen of the London party A-list, Madonna. 'After that,' he says casually, 'it was pretty much up and running.' Amos Pizzey was born in west London. His father, an ex-naval officer, worked in television. His mother, Erin, a diplomat's daughter, founded the first refuge for battered women in Chiswick, bringing the issue of domestic violence out into the open. After they divorced, his dad lived in a flat in the basement of their home with various girlfriends, while Erin unofficially fostered a group of young men Pizzey grew up regarding as his half-brothers. All of them were black, all older than him: 'They were my role models, which is where my cultural confusion stemmed from. I didn't know it, but I had real problems being white at that time.' His liberal parents told him he didn't have to go to school if he didn't want to. So he took his education instead in illegal shebeens, following reggae sound systems. By the time he was 13, he was performing himself, a white boy improvising on the mic in fluent patois. 'I was pretty wild,' he recalls. 'I couldn't write, but I couldn't half rock the mic!' His sister's boyfriend, Mickey Craig, had also moved into their household, and invited Pizzey to join his group, Culture Club. Pizzey worked with them under the alias Captain Crucial. He was 14 and the band was just on the verge of pop success when his mother dropped her bombshell: they were moving to New Mexico. 'The next thing I knew, I was in the desert in Santa Fe. A white kid with dreadlocks, surrounded by cowboys. Not a good move.' For years, Erin Pizzey's life had been a battle. Against the local authority about overcrowding at the refuge. Against feminists, who first celebrated her, then objected to her analysis of the causes of domestic violence. And finally against the legal system, when she refused to reveal the whereabouts of a woman and child she'd smuggled to safety in France. Pizzey remembers being in court with people like Spike Milligan who had taken up his mother's cause, watching her get sent to prison. She was eventually released, but decided to leave Britain. 'It was a bad period,' says Pizzey. 'I'm very proud of my mother. But it wasn't great, a lot of it. She was under a lot of pressure.' In the next few years, they moved across New Mexico, to the Caribbean and then to Italy. By the time he was 16 he was back in London alone, with a fierce self-belief that he says was his mother's gift to him. With his half-brother Cass (now in Skunk Anansie), he formed an abysmal band called Dark Star. They recorded one demo, a calypso version of 'My Girl', and signed a massive record deal. 'I loved the 80s,' laughs Pizzey. 'They gave us a quarter of a million quid. I was 17, Richard Branson took me out to lunch and said, \"You're it, you're going to be the thing.\"' Pizzey didn't have a driving licence, but he had a Jag. And suits with shoulder pads so wide he had to go through doors sideways. They spent two years in the studio, but the resulting album was predictably dire, and the group was dropped. 'If we'd been successful, I would have been such a wanker,' says Pizzey philosophically. 'I mean, I'm a wanker now, but I've got a sense of humour. Taking yourself seriously and being a wanker is a different thing: that's Mick Hucknall.' Undeterred, he formed a rock band with Ringo Starr's son Zak Starkey, and they were big in Japan for a while. By the time he returned to London, Ecstasy and house music had arrived, and Pizzey enthusiastically embraced the new scene. He'd known of Healy for years - Boy George had engineered a stand-off between the two over who had the most authentic dreadlocks - but finally they became friends, recording for O'Dowd's dance label More Protein. When Healy played in clubs, Pizzey would often come along to improvise on the mic over the records. It was on a club trip to Singapore and Bali with Healy at the start of the 90s that Pizzey met Melissa Ong, the woman he was to spend the next seven years of his life with. He took her to his swish hotel in Singapore to impress her; she laughed and told him that her father owned it. In fact, her family owns quite a few hotels, across the world. Along with a substantial oil business and a retail empire built around designer fashion. Although the 80s are often seen as the designer decade, the obsession with labels only became big business in the 90s, when entrepreneurs like the Ongs took an interest. At its peak, the company run by Melissa's mother Christina had the franchises to some 60 designer names including Armani, Prada, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein. She opened flagship stores for these labels across Asia, Australia - and, of course, in London, where she also opened the Metropolitan on Park Lane in 1997. A designer hotel very much in the mould set by Ian Schrager in New York, it had a small bar that the Ongs hoped would draw in hip Londoners as well as hotel guests. Since they wanted the bar to be exclusive, Pizzey advised them not to sell memberships. Instead, they gave them away. A thousand cards went out to carefully selected people, and the deluge began. 'People are always going to fight if they can't get into something,' he shrugs. 'That's so London. It's just a small, red room, but the scenes that went on in there during the peak two years were just ridiculous.' For a while, it seemed that everyone who was anyone passed through the Met Bar. Fran Cutler and Meg Mathews hosted a night there. Models, actors, pop stars and their entourages partied there. 'It wasn't the celebrities, it was the people around them who started to fascinate me,' says Pizzey, explaining his inspiration for the Bleachin' album. 'They were all supposedly producers, directors, models, actors, but all they really did was bugle [cocaine] in the bar. But then you started to notice fall-out. Certain people would get rougher and rougher, their designer facade would slip and they'd end up hassling you for drugs. I found the whole period fascinating. It was the end of the century, there was an element of fiddling while Rome burns.' Monday, 7pm, yet another new cocktail bar, Zeta's, not far from the Met Bar. Pizzey is here with I'Anson, Healy with his Brazilian girlfriend Luciana Silva. We're meeting before the London Club and Bar Awards at the Hilton - a lavish, self-congratulatory affair that offers yet another illustration of how fast this industry has grown. It's being televised, so there's a short film clip before each award. Pizzey guides us on a tour of some of London's new bars before I'Anson comes on stage to present the Best Bar award to Piccadilly's 10 Rooms. Former EastEnders actor Sid Owen presents the Best Club award, reading out the list of nominees and announcing, 'I've been mashed in all of these places.' It goes to Fabric, and the lady who runs their VIP toilets steps up to collect it, joking that she's seen many of the audience lingering in her cubicles. Meanwhile, from the numbers shuttling to the toilets in groups, the hotel's staff could be forgiven for believing they were at a support night for the chronically weak- bladdered. There's another story to the Bleachin' album, one that is told in the final four tracks, where the titles are less celebratory: 'Comedown', 'Fragile', 'Ambulance' and 'Learn to Cry'. It's the story of the lows that always accompany chemical highs, of the many who lost their souls for a line of white powder. But more specifically, it's the story of Pizzey's nephew Keita. Pizzey's sister Cleo was 15 when Keita was born; the father, Mickey Craig, was two years older. Pizzey talks about Keita as a brother, or a son. 'We slept in the same bed because he got scared at night. I changed his nappies, and he always looked up to me 'way too much, I can see now.' Keita came to clubs when Pizzey performed, and had some talent as a rapper himself 'at one point, there was talk of him signing to Boy George's label. Like many clubbers, he got into Ecstasy. Unlike most, he started hearing voices. Gradually, the Pizzeys began to realise he was seriously ill, and discovered that paranoid schizophrenia ran in his father's side of the family. Pizzey spent a lot of time just talking to him, 'really out-there conversations when he'd hear voices talking to him in records and say me and him were here to fight aliens'. Pizzey got him into The Priory for a while, and Keita went through various NHS schemes without ever getting consistent help. Mostly the family was left trying to deal with his illness alone, his mother and grandmother taking turns to care for him. When he asked for money, Pizzey said he'd buy him food, clothes, anything he needed, but he wouldn't give him cash to buy drugs. One day Keita mugged an old lady. When he was chased, he ran to his own home and sat inside the front door, crying, until the police came. At the station, Keita said he was a danger to himself. The police followed procedure, putting him in a shared cell, checking on him every 15 minutes. But then he was transferred to Wandsworth Prison for the night and, by morning, he was dead - hanged in his cell with his laces. Pizzey blames himself for Keita's death. He didn't take drugs with his nephew, but he has never hidden the fact that he does take them. He thinks he's got away with a lot in his life, by being physically fit, by having good friends, by having places he could go to escape and clean out if it all got too much. He wonders if everyone will be as lucky. 'I think the drugs fallout will be massive over the next few generations, because we're doing shit that we've got no idea about.' Saturday, noon, The Dior couture show at L'\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris. On a balcony high in the roof, Healy is pacing about nervously. His music is playing: a simple four-note sequence repeated again and again, punctuated by the crack of a whip and a woman moaning in sexual ecstasy. Below, Steven Spielberg is sitting with his wife Kate Capshaw on one side, Elle Macpherson on the other, brilliantly managing to affect natural-looking conversations with both despite the photographers who surround them in an arc, flashbulbs popping. There's a hush as the show starts with a man in an ornate, feminine bishop's costume, followed by characters from a lavish, yet slightly sinister wedding. As each model moves along the catwalk, the music changes to match the mood. Healy has spent four days in Paris talking through the ideas with Galliano, making the music fit his themes of dysfunctional families and sexual transgression. The final mix includes dance beats, film soundtracks, a stream of obscenities by American performance artist Karen Finlay, and Beethoven's ninth symphony. As always, it's the most exciting music Healy makes. There was a point when he became a symbol of DJ excess. A couple of years ago, he began to slow down. He'd been depressed, he realised, and needed to start enjoying music again, enjoying his life. 'Money isn't everything. Unconsciously, I'd focused so much on my career - and I never thought I would even utter that word - that I was travelling all the time. If you're not around when people phone, after six months no one's going to call you. Success made me quite a lonely person.' Healy's daughter, Marley, was born in 1991. It wasn't something he'd planned, and it didn't make much difference to his life at first: 'I was never with the mother, never said I would be.' But then Marley's mum died. Suddenly, unexpectedly. (In the context of this feature, it seems relevant to say there were no drugs involved.) So Marley came to live with Healy for two days a week, and in their first year together, he finally became a father. 'To see the wonder in her eyes when I show her things is brilliant. It's lovely.' He recently moved into a new apartment in central London after spending months having it fitted to his specifications, yet he talks wistfully of a house he'd seen out in the suburbs, a big house with room for a swimming pool that he says would be lonely without a family to fill it. For now, though, Marley lives in Ibiza with her mother's best friend, who is bringing her up with her own children. Healy doesn't see her as much as he'd like, and he still seems surprised at how painful that is. 'I hope to take on more, to get closer and closer to her. It's difficult, because apart from the summer, I can go two or three months without seeing her, and that tends to hurt. You have to get to know them again, and it takes time to get to that place with them again. That idea of a family may be corny, but to not have that is a lot harder to deal with than to have it. And not to have your daughter with you when you want her to be_ That's one thing I haven't got, and it's about the only thing in my life that could have been worked better.' He pauses then laughs, almost embarrassed. 'But everything else has worked out quite good.' Saturday, 8pm. There's a car waiting at Waterloo. I drive with Healy to his new home. In two hours, he'll leave again to play at a club in Watford. Then it's back to London, where he'll DJ at another club until 5.30am. The next day, he'll fly to Mallorca for another all-nighter, followed by his weekly residency in Ibiza. There are far worse ways to make a living, of course, and Healy certainly isn't complaining. Nonetheless, it's a relentless schedule. Everybody loves you, nothing comes free.",

      "body": "<p>My footballing career peaked with an appearance on the subs bench for Hudson Primary School under-11s in 1971, and my musical skills have never progressed beyond doing the dance to 'Tiger Feet' by Mud while strumming a tennis racquet in front of the mirror. So there is only one route left in this celebrity-crazed world if I am to become rich, famous and adored by thousands of women. I have to become a chef.</p> <p>Therefore, for the past nine weeks I've been chopping, slicing, peeling, whisking, boning and beating. I've sieved soups and made mayonnaise. I've stuffed most varieties of farmyard animal and even a couple of ocean-dwelling fish. I've wrestled with bread dough and been tender with pasta. My hands always smell of garlic and my fingers bear the cuts and coloured plasters of many misjudged slices. I dream of owning a restaurant, and have nightmares about lumpy b\u00e9chamel sauce. And now here I am in the late-night glow of an Anglepoise lamp swotting up on how to fillet a trout and make flaky pastry on the eve of a three-hour practical exam that will determine whether I can add the words 'Cordon Bleu-qualified' to my dinner-party repartee.</p> <p><b> Week 1 </b></p> <p>If cheffing really is the new rock'n'roll, with Jamie Oliver as Oasis to Ainsley Harriot's Kajagoogoo, then I'm the busker you try to avoid outside your local shopping centre. This is brought home to me within hours of arriving at the Victorian country pile just outside Woking that is the Tante Marie School of Cookery. My fellow students all have more cooking experience than me. One of them has even made a souffl\u00e9. The second thing that hits me is that I really am back at school, with loads of rules to be obeyed. For the \u00a33,000 I'm paying for my Cordon Bleu Certificate course, I am not allowed to use the front door or main staircase (tradesman's entrance and narrow back stairs only), I have to address all my teachers formally by their titles and surnames, and I have to wash up my own pots and pans. School dinners, however, won't be quite as I remember them. From now on, I will be cooking and eating the sort of lunch that merits cigars, brandies and afternoon naps all round. Lesson one: if each dish doesn't contain enough butter or cream to clog up several arteries, it ain't Cordon Bleu.</p> <p>My new classmates are a fairly accurate cross-section of the kind of people who enrol at Tante Marie. There's the 18-year-old Sloanie whose parents have not only stumped up for the course, but bought her a new sports car and house as an incentive to pass. There's the Lotus-driving, burnt-out City head-hunter who's just bought a hotel. There's the competitive housewife from Surrey with too much time and money on her hands. There's the relentlessly polite Japanese student who's flown in from Tokyo with the latest cookery books and hardly a word of English. There's the shy teenager from Thailand, reputedly the son of one of Bangkok's richest families. And then there's me, the docker's son from Liverpool, blowing the last of my savings on dreams of Michelin stars and serving seared scallops and pancetta on a bed of baby spinach to Liz Hurley.</p> <p>The first stage towards fulfilling this fantasy is considerably less glamorous: I have to change into my chef's whites and apron in a pokey locker room amid a heaving, sweaty mass of spotty English youths and big, bearded Texans (the female section is much more spacious, complete with window, mirrors and a sofa). Then I find I'm on floor-sweeping duties and that my cooking partner for the first week will be Mariko from Tokyo, who smiles and says 'thank you' to everything I ask her, including 'Have you weighed out the flour yet?'</p> <p>The first recipes we tackle are designed to introduce us to the basic skills of chopping up veg and sauce-making. The Cordon Bleu-approved way of dicing an onion - involving a series of precise horizontal incisions - is more geometry than gourmet. And the way we are shown how to crush a garlic clove bears no resemblance to the way Jamie Oliver splats his with the palm of his hand in that Sainsbury's ad.</p> <p>By the end of the first week, I have made chilli con carne, tagliatelle al forno and a batch of scones. And I have been told off twice for licking my spoon.</p> <p><b> Week 2 </b></p> <p>Spent the weekend back home in Manchester impressing my girlfriend with my new onion-chopping tech nique. Arrived back at school to find my partner this week is Ollie the head-hunter turned hotelier. When I ask what kind of business plan he has to put together to get a bank loan for his hotel, he looks a bit sheepish. Turns out he didn't need a loan. Ollie is 27.</p> <p>Most afternoons involve having the following day's recipes demonstrated to us. The school's star demonstrator is Miss Bond, who casually whips up a three- or four-course meal in the time it takes me to read the instructions on the side of a microwave meal-for-one. We get stiff necks from trying to keep up with her every move in the overhead mirror. 'Am I going too fast?' she asks, blushing innocently.</p> <p>We bake our first loaves of bread. To me, this feels as portentous as a rite of passage. I get the same buzz from turning out my plump brown loaf as I did the first time I changed a wheel on my car.</p> <p>The Tante Marie two-volume cookbook contains nearly 2,000 recipes, lovingly compiled by head teacher Mrs Alexander and a former colleague. There are 14 pages of potato recipes alone, ranging from pommes de terre Mont d'Or (a fancy mash piled into a pyramid shape) to pommes de terre Pont-Neuf (chips the size of bridge girders). The potato dish we are cooking this week seems to sum up everything we need to know about Cordon Bleu: why do things simply and call it a baked potato, when you can add some cheese, double cream, egg, herbs and breadcrumbs and call it pommes de terre farcies \u00e0 la viennoise?</p> <p>Contrary to a rumour probably started by Rory the gay Texan in Group Six, Arancia Caramella isn't the name of the school principal's evil stepmother. It's oranges in syrup on page 327.</p> <p><b> Week 3 </b></p> <p>There are five kitchens at the school, all named after regions of France, and we all dread being timetabled in Alsace. This is at the top of the building and involves lugging buckets of ingredients up and down three flights of stairs. Dozens of aproned students racing up and down to meet lunchtime service deadlines gives the school a convincing working-restaurant feel. There's even a scary Gordon Ramsay-type figure in the shape of the brisk and efficient Miss Hatcher, whose stern glare has been known to make souffl\u00e9s droop.</p> <p>Having last week made shortcrust pastry, we are now going to attempt pastry making the traditional French way, without the safety cushion of a mixing bowl. We are going to make a slab of pat\u00e9 bris\u00e9e by mixing together the flour, butter and egg on a board, one-handed ! Heroically, I manage to keep most of the ingredients within a five-metre radius of my work surface, and sure enough a solid form begins to take shape in my hands out of the gooey, powdery mess. OK, it's only the pastry base for a quiche Alsacienne, but to me it's something beautiful and delicate hewn from the coarsest of raw elements.</p> <p>This is the week we are also introduced to the delights of filleting and skinning fish. We are warned that filets de plie m\u00e9nag\u00e8re - baked fillets of plaice in a mushroom and cheese sauce - is a likely exam dish. This is disheartening news: the amount of flesh I've managed to extract from my fish would be barely enough to feed a skinny cat, never mind a party of four. At the weekend, I buy a bulk order of plaice from my local fishmonger. Late on Saturday night, I finally satisfy myself that I have got the technique right, and am spared plaice on toast for Sunday breakfast.</p> <p><b> Week 4 </b></p> <p>More pastry, this time flaky. I'm really getting into kneading, rolling and folding, and am entertaining images of becoming a pastry chef, all smooth dough and bulging biceps, when there is a distinct squelching from under my rolling pin. My butter and lard is starting to melt in the heat from the ovens which have been on most of the day. Time for one more fold and turn before slamming it into the fridge. We'll be sticking it on top of a chicken-and-mushroom pie tomorrow.</p> <p>We make ice cream. Now I'm sorry, but I didn't think vanilla ice cream was made , I thought it was excavated from a secret cave somewhere in the Caspian Mountains and transported by Cossacks to my local Tesco. And now here I am - with four eggs, a jug of milk and cream, a cup of sugar and a vanilla pod - about to make my own. The only dampner on my excitement is that my partner for this is Competitive Housewife, who has failed to grasp the concept of 'working together'.</p> <p>Our weekly theory class involves joints of meat and ways of cooking them: chump chops or scrag end of lamb anyone?

Using a pastry board and one hand, we mix together flour, eggs, salt and oil. After letting it relax in the fridge for 30 minutes, we roll the dough to unimagined extremities of thinness.

We'll have the option of a pasta machine next time, but for now she wants us to sweat blood, tears and garlic.</p> <p>We also have a crash course in wine appreciation. We whizz through the vineyards of Bordeaux, Burgundy, Australia and New Zealand. This will lead to a heated argument in my local Oddbins on the way home.</p> <p><b> Week 6 </b></p> <p>We've been cooking offal all morning, so today's the perfect day to escape school lunch for the simple pleasures of a tuna salad sandwich from M&amp;S.</p> <p>In the afternoon we are each given an envelope containing \u00a35. This is the funding for our budget lunch, our first practical exam in two weeks' time, when we'll be expected to provide a three-course meal for four people. Before then, we have to prepare details of what we propose to cook, a costings breakdown and timeplan. I raid the school library looking for ideas. By the weekend I have decided on carrot and coriander roulade as a starter, followed by herbed mushroom ravioli in a tomato sauce, accompanied by broccoli in lemon butter, finished off with chocolate and orange mousse. On Saturday I undertake my first rehearsal.

The previous day, she'd had to ask for a volunteer from the Diploma class to kill a lobster: 'I was shaking. Its eyes were looking at me. I thought, \"I can't kill you.\" I got Chris to do it.

I never imagined I would feel this nervous. About halfway through, I suddenly lose the ability to grate a carrot. With Mrs Wooton keeping an eagle eye on our every move from the corner, it's an intimate torture, like taking your driving test. Did I chop that onion speedily enough? Is my section as clean as it should be? Is this sheet of pasta thin enough?

I get 67, which I don't think is anywhere near worthy of the richness of my roulade or quality of my pasta. I suppose the broccoli and mousse could have been better, though.

(La coquille St Jacques); Name four foods which are a good source of Vitamin A? (Haven't a clue).</p> <p><b> Final week - after the exam </b></p> <p>OK, so perhaps last night I spent too much time looking at pictures of fish being filleted.

      "bodyText": "My footballing career peaked with an appearance on the subs bench for Hudson Primary School under-11s in 1971, and my musical skills have never progressed beyond doing the dance to 'Tiger Feet' by Mud while strumming a tennis racquet in front of the mirror. So there is only one route left in this celebrity-crazed world if I am to become rich, famous and adored by thousands of women. I have to become a chef. Therefore, for the past nine weeks I've been chopping, slicing, peeling, whisking, boning and beating. I've sieved soups and made mayonnaise. I've stuffed most varieties of farmyard animal and even a couple of ocean-dwelling fish. I've wrestled with bread dough and been tender with pasta. My hands always smell of garlic and my fingers bear the cuts and coloured plasters of many misjudged slices. I dream of owning a restaurant, and have nightmares about lumpy b\u00e9chamel sauce. And now here I am in the late-night glow of an Anglepoise lamp swotting up on how to fillet a trout and make flaky pastry on the eve of a three-hour practical exam that will determine whether I can add the words 'Cordon Bleu-qualified' to my dinner-party repartee. Week 1 If cheffing really is the new rock'n'roll, with Jamie Oliver as Oasis to Ainsley Harriot's Kajagoogoo, then I'm the busker you try to avoid outside your local shopping centre. This is brought home to me within hours of arriving at the Victorian country pile just outside Woking that is the Tante Marie School of Cookery. My fellow students all have more cooking experience than me. One of them has even made a souffl\u00e9. The second thing that hits me is that I really am back at school, with loads of rules to be obeyed. For the \u00a33,000 I'm paying for my Cordon Bleu Certificate course, I am not allowed to use the front door or main staircase (tradesman's entrance and narrow back stairs only), I have to address all my teachers formally by their titles and surnames, and I have to wash up my own pots and pans. School dinners, however, won't be quite as I remember them. From now on, I will be cooking and eating the sort of lunch that merits cigars, brandies and afternoon naps all round. Lesson one: if each dish doesn't contain enough butter or cream to clog up several arteries, it ain't Cordon Bleu. My new classmates are a fairly accurate cross-section of the kind of people who enrol at Tante Marie. There's the 18-year-old Sloanie whose parents have not only stumped up for the course, but bought her a new sports car and house as an incentive to pass. There's the Lotus-driving, burnt-out City head-hunter who's just bought a hotel. There's the competitive housewife from Surrey with too much time and money on her hands. There's the relentlessly polite Japanese student who's flown in from Tokyo with the latest cookery books and hardly a word of English. There's the shy teenager from Thailand, reputedly the son of one of Bangkok's richest families. And then there's me, the docker's son from Liverpool, blowing the last of my savings on dreams of Michelin stars and serving seared scallops and pancetta on a bed of baby spinach to Liz Hurley. The first stage towards fulfilling this fantasy is considerably less glamorous: I have to change into my chef's whites and apron in a pokey locker room amid a heaving, sweaty mass of spotty English youths and big, bearded Texans (the female section is much more spacious, complete with window, mirrors and a sofa). Then I find I'm on floor-sweeping duties and that my cooking partner for the first week will be Mariko from Tokyo, who smiles and says 'thank you' to everything I ask her, including 'Have you weighed out the flour yet?' The first recipes we tackle are designed to introduce us to the basic skills of chopping up veg and sauce-making. The Cordon Bleu-approved way of dicing an onion - involving a series of precise horizontal incisions - is more geometry than gourmet. And the way we are shown how to crush a garlic clove bears no resemblance to the way Jamie Oliver splats his with the palm of his hand in that Sainsbury's ad. By the end of the first week, I have made chilli con carne, tagliatelle al forno and a batch of scones. And I have been told off twice for licking my spoon. Week 2 Spent the weekend back home in Manchester impressing my girlfriend with my new onion-chopping tech nique. Arrived back at school to find my partner this week is Ollie the head-hunter turned hotelier. When I ask what kind of business plan he has to put together to get a bank loan for his hotel, he looks a bit sheepish. Turns out he didn't need a loan. Ollie is 27. Most afternoons involve having the following day's recipes demonstrated to us. The school's star demonstrator is Miss Bond, who casually whips up a three- or four-course meal in the time it takes me to read the instructions on the side of a microwave meal-for-one. We get stiff necks from trying to keep up with her every move in the overhead mirror. 'Am I going too fast?' she asks, blushing innocently. We bake our first loaves of bread. To me, this feels as portentous as a rite of passage. I get the same buzz from turning out my plump brown loaf as I did the first time I changed a wheel on my car. The Tante Marie two-volume cookbook contains nearly 2,000 recipes, lovingly compiled by head teacher Mrs Alexander and a former colleague. There are 14 pages of potato recipes alone, ranging from pommes de terre Mont d'Or (a fancy mash piled into a pyramid shape) to pommes de terre Pont-Neuf (chips the size of bridge girders). The potato dish we are cooking this week seems to sum up everything we need to know about Cordon Bleu: why do things simply and call it a baked potato, when you can add some cheese, double cream, egg, herbs and breadcrumbs and call it pommes de terre farcies \u00e0 la viennoise? Contrary to a rumour probably started by Rory the gay Texan in Group Six, Arancia Caramella isn't the name of the school principal's evil stepmother. It's oranges in syrup on page 327. Week 3 There are five kitchens at the school, all named after regions of France, and we all dread being timetabled in Alsace. This is at the top of the building and involves lugging buckets of ingredients up and down three flights of stairs. Dozens of aproned students racing up and down to meet lunchtime service deadlines gives the school a convincing working-restaurant feel. There's even a scary Gordon Ramsay-type figure in the shape of the brisk and efficient Miss Hatcher, whose stern glare has been known to make souffl\u00e9s droop. Having last week made shortcrust pastry, we are now going to attempt pastry making the traditional French way, without the safety cushion of a mixing bowl. We are going to make a slab of pat\u00e9 bris\u00e9e by mixing together the flour, butter and egg on a board, one-handed ! Heroically, I manage to keep most of the ingredients within a five-metre radius of my work surface, and sure enough a solid form begins to take shape in my hands out of the gooey, powdery mess. OK, it's only the pastry base for a quiche Alsacienne, but to me it's something beautiful and delicate hewn from the coarsest of raw elements. This is the week we are also introduced to the delights of filleting and skinning fish. We are warned that filets de plie m\u00e9nag\u00e8re - baked fillets of plaice in a mushroom and cheese sauce - is a likely exam dish. This is disheartening news: the amount of flesh I've managed to extract from my fish would be barely enough to feed a skinny cat, never mind a party of four. At the weekend, I buy a bulk order of plaice from my local fishmonger. Late on Saturday night, I finally satisfy myself that I have got the technique right, and am spared plaice on toast for Sunday breakfast. Week 4 More pastry, this time flaky. I'm really getting into kneading, rolling and folding, and am entertaining images of becoming a pastry chef, all smooth dough and bulging biceps, when there is a distinct squelching from under my rolling pin. My butter and lard is starting to melt in the heat from the ovens which have been on most of the day. Time for one more fold and turn before slamming it into the fridge. We'll be sticking it on top of a chicken-and-mushroom pie tomorrow. We make ice cream. Now I'm sorry, but I didn't think vanilla ice cream was made , I thought it was excavated from a secret cave somewhere in the Caspian Mountains and transported by Cossacks to my local Tesco. And now here I am - with four eggs, a jug of milk and cream, a cup of sugar and a vanilla pod - about to make my own. The only dampner on my excitement is that my partner for this is Competitive Housewife, who has failed to grasp the concept of 'working together'. Our weekly theory class involves joints of meat and ways of cooking them: chump chops or scrag end of lamb anyone? This is only marginally less dull than last week's class on the pros and cons of microwave ovens, but not as interesting as next week when we will learn how to correct curdled mayonnaise and lumpy b\u00e9chamel sauce. The teachers try their best, but they're just not as inspiring with a marker pen and flip chart as they are with a fruit knife or spatula. Week 5 Two days off for half-term. Spend most of it cooking for my girlfriend. Shame she's a vegetarian - I feel like an artist denied his full palette of colours. Also have to swot up for our culinary-terms test. The difference between 'd\u00e9glacer' and 'd\u00e9graisser' could mean delight or disgrace in the end of term results. Back at school we have a pasta class. Using a pastry board and one hand, we mix together flour, eggs, salt and oil. After letting it relax in the fridge for 30 minutes, we roll the dough to unimagined extremities of thinness. Mrs Alexander's daughter won't let us stop until the pasta is practically transparent. We'll have the option of a pasta machine next time, but for now she wants us to sweat blood, tears and garlic. We also have a crash course in wine appreciation. We whizz through the vineyards of Bordeaux, Burgundy, Australia and New Zealand. This will lead to a heated argument in my local Oddbins on the way home. Week 6 We've been cooking offal all morning, so today's the perfect day to escape school lunch for the simple pleasures of a tuna salad sandwich from M&amp;S. In the afternoon we are each given an envelope containing \u00a35. This is the funding for our budget lunch, our first practical exam in two weeks' time, when we'll be expected to provide a three-course meal for four people. Before then, we have to prepare details of what we propose to cook, a costings breakdown and timeplan. I raid the school library looking for ideas. By the weekend I have decided on carrot and coriander roulade as a starter, followed by herbed mushroom ravioli in a tomato sauce, accompanied by broccoli in lemon butter, finished off with chocolate and orange mousse. On Saturday I undertake my first rehearsal. I complete it on time, it tastes OK, but my girlfriend's kitchen is left resembling the aftermath of a Sierra Leone Freedom Fighters' convention. Week 7 As Miss Bond demonstrates the subtle art of 'tunnel-boning' a shoulder of lamb, she reveals she is actually a vegetarian. The previous day, she'd had to ask for a volunteer from the Diploma class to kill a lobster: 'I was shaking. Its eyes were looking at me. I thought, \"I can't kill you.\" I got Chris to do it. He just lowered it into the pan and put the lid on. We had to keep a tight hold of the lid. It weighed a pound, so we gave it 10 minutes, plus an extra 10.' This week we make the thinnest pastry yet, for apple strudel. You have to tickle and stretch it gently, until it's as wispy as muslin. Do the final pricings for my budget lunch. I've found a fino sherry in Safeways that works out at 9p for the tablespoon I need, and eggs work out at 6p each in Tesco, though I'll have to pretend the herbs are from my dad's allotment to keep my total to \u00a34.99. Week 8 The day of the budget-lunch exam is here. I never imagined I would feel this nervous. About halfway through, I suddenly lose the ability to grate a carrot.

      "body": "<p>I have just returned from a couple of weeks in Australia, where the winter sun shone nonstop. If you expose yourself to it sensibly (I never went out without being smothered in factor 30), the sun can be one of nature's most powerful mood-boosters. It also provides your body with a significant source of vitamin D, known for its bone-strengthening qualities. Epidemiological studies indicate that sunlight may have a profound effect on the body's neurological system, too, specifically in relation to multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic, progressive disease of the central nervous system. Epidemiologists have noted that in countries where there is a poor level of ultraviolet (UV) light, the body's supply of vitamin D3 drops and the incidence of MS increases. Sunlight seems to influence the metabolism of fatty acids in the eye's retina as well, and may therefore affect the development of retrobular, or optic, neuritis - a common precursor of MS.</p> <p>Multiple sclerosis arises from damage caused to the myelin sheath that surrounds certain nerve fibres. Symptoms include neurological sensations, such as pins and needles and numbness, impaired speech, visual disorders, acute or chronic fatigue, lack of muscular co-ordination or spasms, tremors and sometimes partial paralysis. I see many people in my practice who are interested in how food can help slow down the progress of MS, several of whom have heard that eating gluten-free or raw food, or following bizarre diets may ease their MS. Not only is there no evidence to support the wilder dietary claims, but, worse still, they may result in malnourishment, weakness and depression.</p> <p>My nutritional therapy addresses two major areas. Firstly, it aims to minimise further potential damage to the myelin sheath by increasing intakes of unsaturated fats, vitamin D and antioxidant-rich foods. Secondly, it works to keep the immune system strong, boosts and sustains energy levels and reduces the consumption of antagonistic foodstuffs.</p> <p>The most-talked-about link between food and MS is dietary fat. Northern European and Scandinavian countries, whose populations consume a large amount of saturated animal fats, have more MS sufferers than their southern European counterparts, where olive oil - an unsaturated fat - is typically used in cooking. The problem is that people who consume high levels of saturated fats tend to eat fewer unsaturated fats, which play two important roles in the body. They are components of the membranes, including the myelin sheath, that surround the body's cells, and they are components of prostaglandins, hormone-like compounds that affect the body's nervous- and immune-system's defence mechanisms.</p> <p>Unsaturated fats are found in oily fish and in vegetable oils. Try to eat oily fish at least three times a week, perhaps in the form of tinned sardines on toast, a seared-tuna-ni\u00e7oise salad or a smoked-salmon- topped jacket potato drizzled with olive oil. Eating a lot of oily fish from October to March has the additional advantage of helping to make up for the UK's lack of sunlight. Using a generous amount of any type of vegetable oil (apart from coconut and palm oil) when cooking will also help maintain high levels of unsaturated fats in your body. Not only do vegetable oils provide a useful source of energy and calories, but they taste good, too. Stir-fries are wonderful with sesame seed oil, and the flavour of salads can be enhanced with a mixture of olive and walnut oil.</p> <p>Although MS sufferers tend to be underweight, if weight gain is a problem, keep your fat intake moderate and focus more on oily fish. Many doctors and dieticians who specialise in MS advocate a supplement of unsaturated fatty acids, specifically linoleic acid, because the extra- concentrated dose appears to reduce the severity, and possibly the frequency, of relapses. If this option interests you, discuss it with your medical team.</p> <p>Remember that in order for unsaturated fats to work effectively, you will need to keep your saturated-fat intake down. The concentration of saturated fats is highest in fatty meat, yogurt, cheese, cream, milk, palm and coconut oil, so keep these to a minimum. Because saturated fats compete with unsaturated fats to cross the blood-brain barrier, they may prevent the unsaturated fats from performing their beneficial function, so don't follow a fish supper with cheese or a creamy pudding.</p> <p>You should also ensure that your diet includes lots of foods that contain antioxidants, in other words, such vitamins and minerals as vitamin C and E, beta carotene and selenium. MS sufferers who eat plenty of antioxidant-packed vegetables and fruits not only have stronger immune systems, but also seem to have fewer relapses. Try to eat five portions of fruit a day (a good-sized bowl of strawberries constitutes two portions, for instance, and a glass of fresh orange juice or a couple of greengages or a peach) and accompany your meals with salads or vegetables drizzled with vegetable oil.</p> <p>Incidentally, using fruits to satisfy sweet desires provides your body with a slow, sustainable energy boost; relying on the quick fix of chocolate and refined sugary confectionery to give your body a boost can trigger fluctuating energy levels, which aggravate overall strength. MS sufferers who wean themselves off rapidly absorbed sugars tend to find their stamina increases. Although you should be able to achieve this antioxidant target without a supplement, if you're concerned that your intake's low, ask your doctor to refer you to a dietician, who will advise you.</p> <p>A final piece of advice: drinking more than two to three shots of caffeine a day can destabilise energy levels, weaken your muscles and make you feel out of sorts. The same goes for alcohol, so don't have too much, and avoid drinking on an empty stomach - eating food first will cushion its negative effects.</p>",

Symptoms include neurological sensations, such as pins and needles and numbness, impaired speech, visual disorders, acute or chronic fatigue, lack of muscular co-ordination or spasms, tremors and sometimes partial paralysis. I see many people in my practice who are interested in how food can help slow down the progress of MS, several of whom have heard that eating gluten-free or raw food, or following bizarre diets may ease their MS. Not only is there no evidence to support the wilder dietary claims, but, worse still, they may result in malnourishment, weakness and depression. My nutritional therapy addresses two major areas. Firstly, it aims to minimise further potential damage to the myelin sheath by increasing intakes of unsaturated fats, vitamin D and antioxidant-rich foods. Secondly, it works to keep the immune system strong, boosts and sustains energy levels and reduces the consumption of antagonistic foodstuffs. The most-talked-about link between food and MS is dietary fat. Northern European and Scandinavian countries, whose populations consume a large amount of saturated animal fats, have more MS sufferers than their southern European counterparts, where olive oil - an unsaturated fat - is typically used in cooking. The problem is that people who consume high levels of saturated fats tend to eat fewer unsaturated fats, which play two important roles in the body. They are components of the membranes, including the myelin sheath, that surround the body's cells, and they are components of prostaglandins, hormone-like compounds that affect the body's nervous- and immune-system's defence mechanisms. Unsaturated fats are found in oily fish and in vegetable oils. Try to eat oily fish at least three times a week, perhaps in the form of tinned sardines on toast, a seared-tuna-ni\u00e7oise salad or a smoked-salmon- topped jacket potato drizzled with olive oil. Eating a lot of oily fish from October to March has the additional advantage of helping to make up for the UK's lack of sunlight. Using a generous amount of any type of vegetable oil (apart from coconut and palm oil) when cooking will also help maintain high levels of unsaturated fats in your body. Not only do vegetable oils provide a useful source of energy and calories, but they taste good, too. Stir-fries are wonderful with sesame seed oil, and the flavour of salads can be enhanced with a mixture of olive and walnut oil. Although MS sufferers tend to be underweight, if weight gain is a problem, keep your fat intake moderate and focus more on oily fish. Many doctors and dieticians who specialise in MS advocate a supplement of unsaturated fatty acids, specifically linoleic acid, because the extra- concentrated dose appears to reduce the severity, and possibly the frequency, of relapses. If this option interests you, discuss it with your medical team. Remember that in order for unsaturated fats to work effectively, you will need to keep your saturated-fat intake down. The concentration of saturated fats is highest in fatty meat, yogurt, cheese, cream, milk, palm and coconut oil, so keep these to a minimum. Because saturated fats compete with unsaturated fats to cross the blood-brain barrier, they may prevent the unsaturated fats from performing their beneficial function, so don't follow a fish supper with cheese or a creamy pudding. You should also ensure that your diet includes lots of foods that contain antioxidants, in other words, such vitamins and minerals as vitamin C and E, beta carotene and selenium. MS sufferers who eat plenty of antioxidant-packed vegetables and fruits not only have stronger immune systems, but also seem to have fewer relapses. Try to eat five portions of fruit a day (a good-sized bowl of strawberries constitutes two portions, for instance, and a glass of fresh orange juice or a couple of greengages or a peach) and accompany your meals with salads or vegetables drizzled with vegetable oil. Incidentally, using fruits to satisfy sweet desires provides your body with a slow, sustainable energy boost; relying on the quick fix of chocolate and refined sugary confectionery to give your body a boost can trigger fluctuating energy levels, which aggravate overall strength. MS sufferers who wean themselves off rapidly absorbed sugars tend to find their stamina increases. Although you should be able to achieve this antioxidant target without a supplement, if you're concerned that your intake's low, ask your doctor to refer you to a dietician, who will advise you. A final piece of advice: drinking more than two to three shots of caffeine a day can destabilise energy levels, weaken your muscles and make you feel out of sorts. The same goes for alcohol, so don't have too much, and avoid drinking on an empty stomach - eating food first will cushion its negative effects.",

      "body": "<p>I have three children. They've all got fairish hair and blueish, greyish eyes, but they're far from identical. One likes eating bacon with her fingers and dipping everything in Sainsbury's hot tomato pickle. One has just turned vegetarian. The other would eat rice, baked beans and pears every day of his life. One draws exquisitely, one does it with more imagination than control and one doesn't bother. Two are colour-blind, one isn't - it's a male thing, but it's inherited through the female line, so it will stop with the two (colour-blind) boys but carry on through the (non-colour-blind) girl. And two are right-handed, like me and their mother. The youngest is left-handed. Which means, according to stories I keep seeing, that his life expectancy is five years less than his brother or sister.</p> <p>Today is International Left-Handers Day. Alexander the Great was the first one on record, though the Bible tells us that Benjamin's army included a 700-strong group of left-handed slingshotters. It's a strictly human thing. There are no 'left-handed' dogs, horses or hamsters. 'Human-handedness,' wrote KA Flowers in The Oxford Companion To The Mind , 'appears to have developed along with, and to be a feature of, man's uniquely high level of finger dexterity and capacity to make and use tools.' Anthropologists think it emerged in the lower Stone Age.</p> <p>Some 100,000 years later, there are said to be 600m left-handers in the world today, though that's the roughest of rough guesses. Estimates range as high as 36 per cent of the population and as low as 3 per cent, though an ultrasound study of babies in the womb by Queen's University, Belfast, produced a probably accurate 85/15 split. Handedness certainly begins in the womb - about 18 per cent of 'identical' twins display a left/right split.</p> <p>But while some scientists have suggested that it is a result of prenatal trauma, Dr Amar JS Klar thinks it's genetic. According to his research, published a couple of months ago, 80 per cent of the population is born right-handed and among the remaining 20 per cent there is a 50-50 chance of being left or right - the split works according to the classic Mendelian genetic model for recessive and dominant genes. That is, if you inherit one 'left' gene, you'll be right-handed. Inherit two and you may be 'left'.</p> <p>There are almost certainly more left-handers in Britain than there used to be - probably because we are not so prejudiced against them as we used to be. By and large, for example, left-handed children are no longer forced to write with their right hand. More of them are male than female - men are about 50 per cent more likely to be left-handed than women. Recent research into this has focused on testosterone levels in the womb. Male foetuses produce more testosterone than female and scientists think an excess of it may slow the development of the left side of the brain - which controls the right side of the body. It is also true, though, that all kinds of 'abnormality' are more common in men than women.</p> <p>So what are the health implications of being left-handed? And what does it mean for my youngest son? At first look, the research is not so much inconclusive as strangely incomplete. After a while, some kind of pattern begins to emerge. It's related to our brain's bipolar structure. The use of language is generally the preserve of the left hemisphere. Most lefties have a smaller brain area devoted to language.</p> <p>How does this affect them? Let's start with that most sophisticated use of language: lying. A 1997 experiment by Dr Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire involved 4,900 respondents and revealed a statistically significant difference - lefties are less able to discern when they're being lied to.</p> <p>Why? The guess is that lefties either have less language-specialist grey stuff or make less efficient use of the language-specialist left hemisphere; they are simply not so good at making sophisticated language calls. They are more likely to suffer from that most notable of language misfunctions, dyslexia. They're also more likely to stutter - George VI had both conditions. There is a higher risk of mental illness, including schizophrenia. And they are more likely to be the victim of accidents of various kinds. Canadian psychologist Stanley Cohen claimed that left-handers are 25 per cent more likely to have an accident at work. Studies of A&amp;E departments show a disproportionate number of lefties, according to Lauren Milsom of the Left-handers Club - she's one, she's married to one and they have a pair of leftie children. 'Basically, that's because we're left-handers in a right-handed world,' she says. That's true. In essence, existence is right-handed.</p> <p>The double helix of DNA is 'right-handed' - that is, it spirals in a counter-clockwise direction, like a wood screw. 'Kitchen equipment is the cause of many home accidents, and it's all set up for right-handers. Not that we ever admit that it's a problem. We accept that scissors don't cut for us, they bend and tear. We get on with it. We don't have an alternative.' She is now associated with Anything Left-Handed, a shop in London where you can buy left-handed scissors and the like. 'When you do finally get to use the correct tools,' she says, 'it's a revelation. It's like going from a beaten-up old car where only three gears work to a brand-new Mercedes.'</p> <p>Lefties have a problem with cars, too. They get killed in them more. Well, American ones do, according to research. The assumption here is that, in panic situations, we pull the wheel with our dominant hand. In the US, a leftie doing that will pull themselves into oncoming traffic - not the case here, of course.</p> <p>There is also research which purports to show that left-handers are more likely to be homosexual. So does that mean my son is more likely to, as they say, dress to the left? 'That was a very small and badly conducted study,' says Lauren Milsom. A recent article in Psychological Bulletin disagrees. Collating many different studies, it concluded that gay men are more likely to be left-handers - at least in America, where the research was concentrated.</p> <p>Will my son die younger, then? Well, no. The original research, conducted by Dr Stanley Cohen of the University of British Columbia, drew on baseball records - where handedness is always noted. As he went back through the decades, he discovered fewer and fewer left-handers. He deduced this was because they died younger. When a British team reproduced his research with cricket players, they came up with the same result. Then it was pointed out how our tolerance of left-handers has changed over the last century. The results were re-analysed and it was discovered that lefties lived as long as the rest of us. 'We all breathed a deep sigh of relief,' says Lauren Milsom.</p> <p>So are there any advantages in being left-handed? Well, it's better for writing on a blackboard. And it's better for some sports - though lefties are banned in polo and jai alai, on safety grounds. Left-handed boxers, cricketers, baseball and tennis players seem to have distinct advantages over their right-handed colleagues or competitors. Some say that's because right-handers have less experience of lefties than vice versa.</p> <p>Recent research, though, suggests there's more to it, that it's another effect of brain bipolarity. Left-handers may react faster because certain neural impulses don't have to make the nanosecond cross-brain journey - which may be why lefties are better at returning the 120mph tennis serves that, according to the laws of physics, no one should be able to see.</p> <p>So it's off to the tennis court, then, with my little one. Or maybe a game of football. Given the England team's inability to find even a half-decent left-footer for Euro 2000, Long John Silver could probably have made the squad if he'd been a leftie.</p> <p><b> Grasping left-handedness</b></p> <p>Nearly all cultures associate left-handedness with varying degrees of nastiness. Right is right and the rest is left - a word that originally meant 'weak' and 'worthless'. In Roget's Thesaurus , left-handed leads us to 'oblique', 'insincere', 'clumsy' and 'insulting'. A left-handed compliment is back-handed, a left-handed sugar bowl is a chamber pot, a left-handed wife is a mistress and a left-handed marriage one of social unequals. Catholics are left-footers, though they call themselves 'right-handers'. Sinister comes to us from the Latin for left. Gauche is our direct 18th-century adoption of the French word for it - and that comes from gauchir , which means 'warp'. Cack-handed - an old synonym for left-handed - means, quite simply, shit-handed. An echo of the Muslim ban on eating with the 'unclean' left hand?</p> <p>The French, German and Dutch all share our right/good, left/bad perspective. Even history's beleaguered minorities have a thing against lefties. The Hebrew for a left-hander is eetair yad yemino - a person who is not right-handed. And gypsies use the word 'bongo', no relation to the African drums but Roma for 'evil'. 'All religions are united in one thing,' said Dr Amar JS Klar, disentangler of the left-handed gene conundrum.

We've all heard about the banality of evil - Big Brother brings you the banality of banality. Increasingly, over the last few weeks, the contestants's trials and tribulations have had an almost fairy-tale beat to them: who's going to sleep with who first? Who's going to burst into tears next? Who's been eating my porridge? </p> <p>As well as being voyeuristic and seedy, Big Brother manages to exude the most frigid of atmospheres - it's a bit like watching wife swapping enacted by people who've been technically impotent for years.

That includes dreary Sada, repellent Andrew, strident Caroline, flirty Mel and arrogant Darren. Not to mention louche, manipulative, insurance broker Nick Bateman, the contestant we all love to hate, but secretly want to stick around until the bitter end. </p> <p>With his obvious and clumsy attempts to set everybody against each other, and divide and conquer, 'Nasty Nick' has unwittingly become the true star of Big Brother . At the beginning of the week, The Sun even went so far as to hire a helicopter to scatter leaflets over the Big Brother camp in a failed attempt to warn the others of Nick's 'evil' duplicity.

Wedding rings cost from \u00a3200 to \u00a35,000. Once preparations begin in earnest, hire a 'wedding co-ordinator' (about \u00a31,000 or 15 per cent of the total cost of the wedding). They can order the cake (\u00a3300), book photographers (up to \u00a31,500) and organise caterers and stationers for the invitations. The laws concerning wedding venues have been relaxed, so it is now possible to get married underwater or in a stately home (from \u00a32,000). King Constantine of Greece managed to book Hampstead's Kenwood House for his daughter's wedding - with the help of a \u00a35,000 donation. Use your imagination when arranging the reception. The main hall of the Natural History Museum, for instance, is available for \u00a37,000, although it may not be such a practical idea if there is the chance of an alcohol-fuelled brawl. It always possible to cut costs. Serve supermarket own-brand champagne, like Gordon Brown, or borrow a friend's Ford Capri rather than splashing out on a 20s Rolls-Royce (\u00a3600 for the day). However, don't stint on the honeymoon - these may be the happiest days of your married life, and it is far better to have spent them in Bali than Bognor. Average wedding for 100 guests Engagement ring \u00a31,000 Wedding ring \u00a3200 Venue \u00a32,000 Clothes, including wedding dress \u00a34,000 Catering, including cake \u00a33,300 Flowers \u00a3400 Stationery \u00a3100 Photographer \u00a3500 Honeymoon \u00a32,500 Total \u00a314,000",

      "body": "<p>Jim Spowart probably deserves to be known as 'Mr Mortgage'. </p> <p> Even if your interest in money is minimal you will have noticed the proliferation of advertisements for new-fangled mortgages and savings accounts. Jim Spowart is one of the reasons for all this activity. He took Direct Line into savings and mortgages, and at Standard Life he pioneered the flexible homeloan in the UK. </p> <p> Now he is working for Halifax bank, as it tests the systems for IF, or Intelligent Finance. IF will offer a full range of banking and savings accounts but the big idea is that if you have deposits with IF, these will be set against borrowings to reduce the interest you pay. Spowart argues that IF customers shouldn't have to shop around obsessively for a good deal in an industry obsessed with profits. </p> <p> 'Banks have forgotten they are the custodians of people's money,' he says. And, naturally, IF will operate via the internet and the telephone. IF's launch was postponed when Spowart and his team discovered that it couldn't cope under pressure. The team is now testing upgrades with the aim of launching by the end of this month. </p> <p> One of IF's guiding principles is that some of the best returns to be had on your money are available simply by paying off debt.It's not a new idea; the flexible mortgage draws on it, as does Virgin's current account mortgage. But Spowart is not sure the mass market is ready to tie mortgages to current accounts and, anyway, he is a great believer in the jam-jar system for managing money. At Direct Line and Standard Life, savers could designate separate accounts for different purposes - holidays, new car, wedding - but still be paid a high rate of interest on their total balance. </p> <p> Spowart, now earning \u00a3250,000 a year plus bonuses, still has a budget account to pay for holidays and bills, a throwback to his days as a \u00a328-a-month bank employee. This Scot, who lists 'church elder' as a hobby on his CV, has 'Presbyterian' attitudes to money: 'It's important but not the be-all and end-all.' He derives satisfaction from having created 4,500 jobs in the businesses he has built. But money is not so unimportant that it did not play a part in his decision to move from Standard Life. </p> <p> He moved there on \u00a3125,000, not, in retrospect due recognition of the job he had done for the insurer: 'I was poorly rewarded for that.' But it's not the money itself that is the issue, he insists, but that people be suitably rewarded for the job they do. </p> <p> Having built three businesses from scratch, Spowart has had little time to spend what surplus he has accumulated. Even if he had, he wouldn't flash it around, he says. He enjoys the trappings of a comfortable middle-class existence - a good holiday each year, membership of a golf club and a car for his wife. </p> <p> At 49 he has no mortgage and he recently bought a flat in Edinburgh for his two sons, one of whom is still at university. He has an accountant to handle his tax affairs , and manages his own investments, a collection of unit trusts, shares and deposit accounts, but he doesn't find this particularly exciting. </p> <p> And yes, of course, he will have IF accounts. If it all sounds a little dull, ask yourself this: no matter how much we want innovation from our banks, would we trust a banker who was flamboyant with his own money?</p>",

But Spowart is not sure the mass market is ready to tie mortgages to current accounts and, anyway, he is a great believer in the jam-jar system for managing money. At Direct Line and Standard Life, savers could designate separate accounts for different purposes - holidays, new car, wedding - but still be paid a high rate of interest on their total balance. Spowart, now earning \u00a3250,000 a year plus bonuses, still has a budget account to pay for holidays and bills, a throwback to his days as a \u00a328-a-month bank employee. This Scot, who lists 'church elder' as a hobby on his CV, has 'Presbyterian' attitudes to money: 'It's important but not the be-all and end-all.' He derives satisfaction from having created 4,500 jobs in the businesses he has built. But money is not so unimportant that it did not play a part in his decision to move from Standard Life. He moved there on \u00a3125,000, not, in retrospect due recognition of the job he had done for the insurer: 'I was poorly rewarded for that.' But it's not the money itself that is the issue, he insists, but that people be suitably rewarded for the job they do. Having built three businesses from scratch, Spowart has had little time to spend what surplus he has accumulated. Even if he had, he wouldn't flash it around, he says. He enjoys the trappings of a comfortable middle-class existence - a good holiday each year, membership of a golf club and a car for his wife. At 49 he has no mortgage and he recently bought a flat in Edinburgh for his two sons, one of whom is still at university. He has an accountant to handle his tax affairs , and manages his own investments, a collection of unit trusts, shares and deposit accounts, but he doesn't find this particularly exciting. And yes, of course, he will have IF accounts. If it all sounds a little dull, ask yourself this: no matter how much we want innovation from our banks, would we trust a banker who was flamboyant with his own money?",

One area of their finances which they would particularly like to sort out is their mortgage. </p> <p>Like many couples nowadays, both had already started buying their own properties before they met and married. So when they bought a joint home two and a half years ago, they decided to transfer the repayment vehicles they had been using previously to cover their new mortgage. In Caroline's case, this was a Norwich Union endowment which she had taken out in 1989 to repay her original \u00a335,000 home loan. Bill, on the other hand, had been advised to take out a pension mortgage with J Rothschild Assurance to cover his \u00a350,000 mortgage, as he was not a member of a company pension scheme at the time. To top up, the couple took out a further endowment for \u00a330,000 with J Rothschild for the increased mortgage on their new home. </p> <p>However, two years ago, Bill joined his employer's occupational pension scheme and ceased contributing to his personal pension. Caroline explains 'So far we have made no alternative provision for repaying that part of the mortgage and would like advice about what to do next'. Their current mortgage is a five-year fixed-rate loan (7.85 per cent) with the Halifax. They are halfway through the five-year period and though they have looked into getting a more competitive deal they found the redemption penalty on the current loan was too high and have decided to stay put. </p> <p>Caroline is also a member of a company pension scheme. She has been in her present scheme for the past 18 months and has transferred the value of pension benefits built up with her last employer over the previous four years into the scheme. 'When I joined my current scheme I also started paying maximum AVCs, realising I needed to boost my pension, especially as I am not sure whether I will always want to work full time.' At present, though, she is planning to return to work in January full time, or almost full time, after the new baby. </p> <p>Apropos the increasing size of their family, another area on which Bill and Caroline would like advice is life assurance. 'One thing we are not sure about is how much cover we really need' says Caroline. </p> <p>In terms of savings they currently have about \u00a3500 in an HSBC Tessa and about \u00a3500 in a Halifax account. They raided another account with Northern Rock recently to buy a new car. After Caroline returns to work next January and allowing for increased childcare costs, they expect to be able to save around \u00a3200 per month which they would like to put aside for the children with a view to the time when they will be going to university, 'or so we hope', says Caroline.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Gordon Wilson</strong></p> <p>Bill and Caroline should address the mortgage issue without delay. This is a good example of one of the main disadvantages of pension mortgages. For the debt to be repaid at the end of the term, not only must the pension fund be four times the size of the mortgage to allow sufficient cash to be withdrawn, the assumption is that your circumstances will never change. What makes matters worse in Bill's case is the transfer value of the fund is \u00a38,000 less than the fund value, a quite staggering penalty if he wants to transfer it. On its own, this pension fund will not be large enough to repay the \u00a350,000. A strategy is required to repay the mortgage, probably by age 60 at the latest. This could be achieved through a capital and interest mortgage. It is also important for Bill and Caroline to check that they have sufficient life assurance to repay the full mortgage amount of \u00a3115,000. </p> <p>As to other life cover, they need to work through a few 'what if' scenarios. Ideally, a list of all expenses should be drawn up to see what level of income is required to maintain the family. The cheapest way of providing life assurance is often by using term assurance. The term should normally be until the children have completed their education which could be about 23 years in their case.</p> <p>To illustrate the costs involved, \u00a3100,000 of term cover for 23 years on a joint life basis would cost around \u00a330 a month.</p> <p>Loans and credit cards tend to be expensive and should be cleared before saving. Caroline may also need to rethink her pension strategy on return to work in January. If she reduces her hours, she may become a basic-rate taxpayer which would make AVCs much less attractive. Individual Savings Accounts may be a more flexible option. Once these issues have been addressed, any surplus can be used to save for the children. Fidelity International is a well managed fund suitable for this purpose. Another alternative is Invesco GT's Rupert fund. </p> <p>\u0095 Gordon Wilson works for financial advisers Aitchison &amp; Colegrave. </p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Charles Levett-Scrivener</strong></p> <p>There are considerable issues which Caroline and Bill need to tackle. In deciding what action to take, priorities must be established. I would suggest with one very young child and another on the way, the first priority should be to have sufficient life cover both to repay the mortgage and provide an income for the children and surviving spouse. As a minimum, the cover should be 10 times the main breadwinner's gross salary plus sufficient cover to repay the mortgage. </p> <p>They also need to check the long term health insurance their employers offer. If they are not provided with this benefit, they need to arrange their own income protection insur ance, particularly for the main breadwinner. Caroline may have to wait until shortly after the end of her pregnancy before she can arrange these policies to ensure that no complications have arisen.</p> <p>They should contact the building society as soon as possible and request that part of the mortgage previously covered by Bill's personal pension be placed on a repayment basis. There should not be any early redemption penalty as a result of this new arrangement as only a small amount of capital will be repaid. The term should be arranged to coincide with Bill's retirement. Caroline and Bill should then concentrate on the repayment of their consumer debt before saving, particularly the credit card, as the rate of interest on this will be very high. The car loan rate of interest is also likely to be high but there may be quite steep penalties for its early repayment.</p> <p>After that, they should both focus on building up an emergency contingency reserve of at least three months' expenses plus a sum of money available for repairs to the car. If it is their intention to regularly replace the car they should be saving to build up the necessary funds for this purpose rather than taking out car loans. Only when all these issues have been addressed should they look at savings and investments for the longer term. </p> <p>\u0095 Charles Levett-Scrivener works for financial advisers Towry Law.</p>",

With a new spurt of energy halfway through the season, as if to remind us there's no slacking in these 72 concerts, the BBC Proms were at their singular best in a distinctive programme featuring Jessye Norman and the London Sinfonietta.

Yet that fact in itself made the opportunity to hear them all the more intriguing, with Jessye Norman a perfect exponent of their kittenish wit and Mark Markham an agile accompanist.

      "body": "<p><strong> House </strong> and<strong> Garden</strong> Lyttelton and Olivier, London SE1 </p> <p>This morning I found a pot of English marmalade in my handbag and pulled it out like a trophy, proof that the marathon - Alan Ayckbourn's two plays, House and Garden - wasn't a splendid, demented dream. It happened. I bought the marmalade at the country fete held in the National Theatre's foyer afterwards - but I'll meander back to that later. </p> <p>Ayckbourn's House and Garden run at the same time, in separate theatres: House at the Lyttelton, Garden in the Olivier. The same cast perform in both plays and commute between theatres. Ayckbourn directs. The plays were written as Ayckbourn's sixtieth birthday present to himself. They are a masterpiece of timing that Mussolini could not have bettered. But are they any thing more than a technical tour de force? </p> <p>The short and satisfactory answer to this question is: yes. The dramatic experiment goes far beyond a clever trick. There is an artistic thrill in the sense of a life going on simultaneously elsewhere, the sure knowledge that for every story we find ourselves caught up in, there is another running alongside. But the beauty of the plays - unlike life - is that we can fully sample two versions of one day, which together make a delicious, substantial sandwich. </p> <p>I saw House first, at a matin\u00e9e, and then Garden in the evening. House bursts at the seams with comedy, intrigue and calamity. Meet Teddy Platt, 'hero' of House and Garden, brilliantly performed by David Haig. He has to do particularly strenuous theatre-hopping and often arrives on stage puffing and perspiring.

      "bodyText": "House and Garden Lyttelton and Olivier, London SE1 This morning I found a pot of English marmalade in my handbag and pulled it out like a trophy, proof that the marathon - Alan Ayckbourn's two plays, House and Garden - wasn't a splendid, demented dream. It happened. I bought the marmalade at the country fete held in the National Theatre's foyer afterwards - but I'll meander back to that later. Ayckbourn's House and Garden run at the same time, in separate theatres: House at the Lyttelton, Garden in the Olivier. The same cast perform in both plays and commute between theatres. Ayckbourn directs. The plays were written as Ayckbourn's sixtieth birthday present to himself. They are a masterpiece of timing that Mussolini could not have bettered. But are they any thing more than a technical tour de force? The short and satisfactory answer to this question is: yes. The dramatic experiment goes far beyond a clever trick. There is an artistic thrill in the sense of a life going on simultaneously elsewhere, the sure knowledge that for every story we find ourselves caught up in, there is another running alongside. But the beauty of the plays - unlike life - is that we can fully sample two versions of one day, which together make a delicious, substantial sandwich. I saw House first, at a matin\u00e9e, and then Garden in the evening. House bursts at the seams with comedy, intrigue and calamity. Meet Teddy Platt, 'hero' of House and Garden, brilliantly performed by David Haig. He has to do particularly strenuous theatre-hopping and often arrives on stage puffing and perspiring. Teddy has more than one reason to sweat: he may be about to become a Tory MP, but it will depend on cutting a dash with influential novelist Gavin Ryng-Mayne (a perfectly reptilian performance by Malcolm Sinclair) who is coming to lunch. Teddy is an awful, loveable, womanising rogue. No shrubbery is safe from him - though try telling that to Giles Mace (Michael Siberry), a doltish nice guy who misses what is staring him in the face.

      "body": "<p><strong> Rules of Engagement</strong> (127 mins, 15) Dir by William Friedkin; starring Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel L. Jackson, Guy Pearce </p> <p>Forty years ago Kenneth Tynan conducted a lengthy interview for The Observer with Jean-Paul Sartre, during which he asked if right-wing art was possible. Unfortunately, instead of saying la droite (the political Right), he said le droit (the law). Before he could correct himself, Sartre had taken off on an unstoppable spiel, beginning with the assertion that 'the law is theatre' and going on to show that 'the characters of Sophocles, of Euripides, even of Aeschylus - they are all lawyers' and that 'the stage is the courtroom'. </p> <p>When Tynan returned to the matter in hand, asking Sartre if 'an author of extreme right-wing views could ever succeed in creating a work of art', he received a plain answer 'in my opinion, no'. According to Sartre, as the Right no longer understood how the world functions 'one can't imagine a modern play that could be at the same time right-wing and good'. </p> <p>I thought of this exchange while watching William Friedkin's Rules of Engagement because as a courtroom drama it fulfils in the most literal way Sartre's definition of what constitutes theatre and also because it's arguably right-wing and unarguably pretty bad, though not without entertaining moments, mostly connected with the central performances. </p> <p>There have always been two streams of Hollywood movies about the armed forces - those made with the assistance of the army, navy or air force, which have constituted the majority, and those which have not sought, or have been denied, official assistance. Rules of Engagement belongs very clearly in the former category, as a somewhat extreme apologia for military conduct and thinking. It begins in the swamps of Vietnam in 1968 where a young black lieutenant, Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson), saves the life of a fellow officer, Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), by committing a war crime. To compel a North Vietnamese colonel to call off his men bent on killing Hodges's isolated section, Childers murders a Vietcong prisoner-of-war in cold blood. This is what happens in battle, the film implies, and only a civilian would think it improper. </p> <p>The film cuts to 29 years later when both men are US marine colonels, one divorced, the other married to the corps. Hodges, a military lawyer of no great distinction (he's been behind a desk since being crippled in Nam), is on the point of retirement; Childers is on active service in the Indian Ocean. </p> <p>When a mob of Islamic fundamentalists threatens the American embassy in Yemen, Childers takes a platoon of Marines to the rescue, saving the ambassador and his family, but ordering his men to fire on the mob, whom he sees as an armed threat to his men, and 83 civilians are killed and more than 100 wounded. As a result he returns home not to a hero's welcome, but to a court martial with the possibility of receiving a death sentence. Improbably, he asks his old chum Hodges to defend him, rather than engaging a hot-shot civilian. </p> <p>Credit for the story goes to the film's executive producer, James Webb, who served as a marine officer in Vietnam before working as a lawyer, writer on military affairs and US Secretary of the Navy under Reagan. The screenplay, however, is by a television writer, Stephen Gaghan, and it is presumably he who has larded it with every clich\u00e9 in the book from the retired lawyer out fly-fishing when he's called back to the fray to the ridiculous bonding fight between old chums that ends in black eyes, bloody noses and laughter. </p> <p>There are the usual surprise witnesses, of course, as well as vital bits of evidence that suddenly turn up, though these are all acceptable aspects of the courtroom genre.

      "bodyText": "Rules of Engagement (127 mins, 15) Dir by William Friedkin; starring Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel L. Jackson, Guy Pearce Forty years ago Kenneth Tynan conducted a lengthy interview for The Observer with Jean-Paul Sartre, during which he asked if right-wing art was possible. Unfortunately, instead of saying la droite (the political Right), he said le droit (the law). Before he could correct himself, Sartre had taken off on an unstoppable spiel, beginning with the assertion that 'the law is theatre' and going on to show that 'the characters of Sophocles, of Euripides, even of Aeschylus - they are all lawyers' and that 'the stage is the courtroom'. When Tynan returned to the matter in hand, asking Sartre if 'an author of extreme right-wing views could ever succeed in creating a work of art', he received a plain answer 'in my opinion, no'. According to Sartre, as the Right no longer understood how the world functions 'one can't imagine a modern play that could be at the same time right-wing and good'. I thought of this exchange while watching William Friedkin's Rules of Engagement because as a courtroom drama it fulfils in the most literal way Sartre's definition of what constitutes theatre and also because it's arguably right-wing and unarguably pretty bad, though not without entertaining moments, mostly connected with the central performances. There have always been two streams of Hollywood movies about the armed forces - those made with the assistance of the army, navy or air force, which have constituted the majority, and those which have not sought, or have been denied, official assistance. Rules of Engagement belongs very clearly in the former category, as a somewhat extreme apologia for military conduct and thinking. It begins in the swamps of Vietnam in 1968 where a young black lieutenant, Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson), saves the life of a fellow officer, Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), by committing a war crime. To compel a North Vietnamese colonel to call off his men bent on killing Hodges's isolated section, Childers murders a Vietcong prisoner-of-war in cold blood. This is what happens in battle, the film implies, and only a civilian would think it improper. The film cuts to 29 years later when both men are US marine colonels, one divorced, the other married to the corps. Hodges, a military lawyer of no great distinction (he's been behind a desk since being crippled in Nam), is on the point of retirement; Childers is on active service in the Indian Ocean. When a mob of Islamic fundamentalists threatens the American embassy in Yemen, Childers takes a platoon of Marines to the rescue, saving the ambassador and his family, but ordering his men to fire on the mob, whom he sees as an armed threat to his men, and 83 civilians are killed and more than 100 wounded. As a result he returns home not to a hero's welcome, but to a court martial with the possibility of receiving a death sentence. Improbably, he asks his old chum Hodges to defend him, rather than engaging a hot-shot civilian. Credit for the story goes to the film's executive producer, James Webb, who served as a marine officer in Vietnam before working as a lawyer, writer on military affairs and US Secretary of the Navy under Reagan. The screenplay, however, is by a television writer, Stephen Gaghan, and it is presumably he who has larded it with every clich\u00e9 in the book from the retired lawyer out fly-fishing when he's called back to the fray to the ridiculous bonding fight between old chums that ends in black eyes, bloody noses and laughter. There are the usual surprise witnesses, of course, as well as vital bits of evidence that suddenly turn up, though these are all acceptable aspects of the courtroom genre. More significantly, however, the audience is given nothing to ponder, evaluate, think about. We should be in the position of the seven marine majors who make up the jury. Instead, we're made privy to vital information that would not merely have been useful for the defence but would have prevented Childers from being indicted in the first place. The villains of the piece (worse than the Yemeni mob whom the movie views as so many towelheads) are a suave National Security Adviser (Bruce Greenwood), with a portrait of Jack Kennedy, on his wall and a cowardly US ambassador (Ben Kingsley), with a throbbing vein in his temple. But we aren't invited to assess their credibility as witnesses. We've already seen the ambassador act in a craven fashion in Yemen so we know he's a gross perjurer when he accuses Childers of losing his cool and enforcing the evacuation. We also see the Security Adviser, who's looking for a scapegoat to appease Middle- Eastern opinion, destroy a video from the embassy's CCTV surveillance camera that shows (rather unlikely this) that every man, woman and child in the mob had a concealed automatic weapon and fired on the Marines. This pair are contrasted with a newly discovered good guy, the Vietnamese colonel Childers had captured in the jungle 30 years earlier, and who now salutes his old adversary. Seeing this movie after the Republican Convention in Philadelphia is an unnerving experience. The presidential candidate avoided serving in Vietnam and his vice-presidential running mate had 'more pressing business' than doing his national service. Yet the party called in Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf and General Colin Powell to rouse the delegates. Do the producers of Rules of Engagement really believe that the American public is still hostile to the armed forces, and if so do they think that simplistic gung-ho movies that back the boys in uniform right or wrong are the way to restore confidence in the military? Another question about the film is raised by the final name on the cast list - talk show host - G. Gordon Liddy. What was the most right-wing member of the Watergate plumbers doing in this movie and why was he cut from the print being shown in Britain?",

Er, no. There are still people who believe racism, child abuse and throat cancer are unsuitable subjects for comedy, yet in the space of a week I've laughed at lines about all of them. I didn't feel terrible afterwards, either. Scott Capurro has provoked mass walk-outs from his show with a gag which climaxes in the phrase 'Holocaust schmolocaust', but the people who thought this line beyond the pale were still outnumbered by those who sat there laughing. I would argue strongly that it's not intrinsically inappropriate or offensive to make people laugh at the darkest aspects of life and society. It's just really, really difficult. </p> <p>There are various ways of attacking this problem, from Capurro's head-on provocation to the subtle, soft-soap charms of Omid Djalili, whose claim to fame used to be that he was 'the only Iranian comedian in the world'. Now there are two others, so his new unique selling point is that he's the only Iranian comedian in the world with a burgeoning Hollywood career (he sold Russell Crowe to Oliver Reed in Gladiator ), a plummy English accent (he was educated at Queen's, Belfast), and the ability to mimic middle-class women with two kids and a Range Rover fighting their way through a Waitrose car park. </p> <p>'Out of my way, out of my way!' he shrieks with a face like a nun in a brothel, and 60 audience members howl with laughter. The sixty-first member of the audience sits pale-faced and tense, gripping the keys to her Range Rover. But not to worry, for a minute later she is grinning again. Djalili has no wish to offend anyone: he is, as he tells us from the outset in the thick Middle Eastern accent of a Bond villain, a 'crowd-pleaser', whose often pointed observations are always softened by his trademark 'winning smile'. </p> <p>As with the young Lenny Henry, every serious racial point in his show is immediately undercut. Yet the point remains made. 'If you laugh at an ethnic comedian,' he says, 'you warm to his culture. So by the end of the night you'll be feeling very warm towards Islamic fundamentalism.' Djalili's strategy is to blow you away with a blizzard of gags, identities, accents and funny faces, as if to settle on one form of comedy for more than a minute would be to invite his worst enemy - boredom. The downside of this is obviously an inability to develop something slower and more thoughtful, but when you're a short, pudgy Iranian playing clubs full of drunken bigots, this is not the kind of activity you get much chance to practise. His reponse to hecklers who call him an 'Arab twat' is, he reveals, to reply: 'Thank you for reaffirming my identity.' </p> <p> A Lump In My Throat has at its core another likeable man (journalist and author John Diamond) and a similar determination to prove that comedy is, like an inverted Yellow Pages, not just there for the happy things in life. This is a shorter, rawer version of the show that played in London earlier this year to rave reviews. </p> <p>Most people in the first-night audience were Diamond fans, but it's not compulsory. Even if you don't like the columns, condensed into an hour they gain a new intensity. Performed by the charmingly downbeat Robert Katz, the evening starts off light and darkens deeply as the evening (and the cancer) progresses, but even at the end there are still cathartic laughs. </p> <p>One of the most notable trends this year has been the increasingly blurred line between comic theatre and stand-up, and the most interesting shows often exist somewhere in that blur. A Man of Substance in a World of Filth is a one-man character monologue which keeps bursting into improvised interactions with the audience. Written and performed by the gawky, dynamic Andrew Clover, it is fairly unhinged, but never dull. </p> <p>Clover plays a scholar of eighteenth-century literature who believes himself to be the reincarnation of Jonathan Swift, and who has a peculiarly intense relationship with his mother. Barking and braying, he takes us through his eccen tric life, family and self-made porn collection. Then he strips butt naked, prances around while making a deranged final speech, and runs off to a standing ovation. </p> <p>Of course, not every comedy show at Edinburgh can be intelligent, lively and thought-provoking. There are plenty of chancers and idiots here to spoil the fun, and some of them are getting five-star reviews in other papers. One such is Jeff Innocent, a man whose musclebound suit and shaven, steel-lined head give you a fair indication of his life and material. He grew up in east London, got involved in crime, went to prison, and has come out the other end of the system a successful stand-up comedian. </p> <p>In many ways this is an inspiring story, and you certainly couldn't accuse Innocent of glamorising violent psychopaths (unlike, say, most of the British media). There's nothing 'offensive' about him at all, in fact. Yet his rise is still deeply depressing. Because he is clearly not a natural stand-up: his style is an achingly competent, join-the-dots variety, every bog-standard gag and painfully timed facial gesture seemingly learnt at an evening course taught by Jim Davidson. Taboo schmaboo - in comedy, nothing is more offensive than a mediocre performer telling banal jokes.</p>",

      "body": "<b> June 1996</b> <br> I'm encouraged by director John Tiffany to write a very short play called Nice for the Traverse Theatre. As a result of this I'm given a commission to write a longer, grown-up play - and yes, from 1996 to 2000 does seem rather a long time to have had a commission and not produced a play but it is 'one big lateness in this house', as a character in the play remarks irritably. <p>All I know about the play in its embryonic stage is that it's set in one room and there's a ghost. But, most importantly for me (because I cannot write without one), it has a title - Abandonment. So all you have to do now is write it, J.T. says. Yes indeed, that's all. </p> <p> <b> November</b> <br> Write the first draft of Abandonment. Complain to J.T. that it's all dialogue and dialogue isn't something I really do . Well it is now,he responds, a mite testily. I think fondly of Slava's Snowshow in which there is no dialogue at all, but, sadly, I am not not writing a play with a part for a Russian existentialist clown. </p> <p> <b> 1997-1998</b> <br> Spend a year trying - and failing - to write the next novel. Give up and write second draft of Abandonment . Begin to get the hang of dialogue. No longer yearn for pages of descriptive writing but am still finding it very hard to eradicate speech indicators ('remarks irritably', 'responds a mite testily' and so on.) Adverbs are a particular loss. How on earth will the actors know how this naked speech is to be played? Trust them, J.T. advises (with quite a few adverbs). And how will we ever get by without helpful little signposts for the audience indicating 'this is funny' (and conversely, and perhaps more importantly, 'this is not funny')? </p> <p>Write a third draft, still hanging on to all those lengthy stage directions that make directors despair - 'She looks up with interested expression on her face' or 'Exits to kitchen carry ing plates, cutlery, glasses, etc'. The play is going through its 'postmodern' stage, deconstructing all over the place, actors aware they're actors in a play and so on. Gently coaxed out of this (thank goodness). </p> <p> <b> 1998</b> <br> Abandon Abandonment and return to writing Emotionally Weird which, under the influence of the play, is suddenly full of dialogue. </p> <p> <b> 1999</b> <br> Finally finish Emotionally Weird. Write fourth draft of Abandonment. </p> <p> <b> February 2000</b> <br> Workshop the play. Can't get over the novelty of actors speaking words that have been two-dimensional for so long. </p> <p> <b> April</b><br> Fifth draft. Finally eliminate all those stage directions. </p> <p> <b> May</b> <br> Start casting. Leave some of the casting rather late and make one actress read the script and give us an answer the day before she gets married. Are we sympathetic? No. Casting makes you strangely ruthless. Finally we have our complete cast, every one a diamond - James Cunningham, Michelle Gomez, Kathryn Howden, Patricia Kerrigan, Neil McKinven, Sheila Redi, Elaine C. Smith. </p> <p> <b> June</b><br> See the model of the set for the first time. Designer Georgia Sion has made an exquisitely detailed claustrophobic doll's-house room - a round Victorian sitting room that must serve as both the past and the present, a panoramic curve that moves from order into disintegration, from reality to facsimile. </p> <p>Start rehearsals, sitting round a table for the week going through the script with the actors, the result of which is the sixth draft which we rehearse for the next three weeks. </p> <p>A word in praise of actors - apart from being intelligent and resourceful and brave and all that stuff - they never show that they're bored. Perhaps they aren't but I would be if I had to keep saying the same thing again and again (especially when I might not actually like what I was saying) each time finding a different nuance, a different place to go. </p> <p> <b> July</b> <br> Technical rehearsal. Two long days' tech, 14 hours back to back, and the first time we've seen the completed set. Feel as if I've shrunk inside the model. The window, big on the model, enormous in reality, looks out on a cloudy backcloth of galactic nebulae, the kind of view you see from the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. 'You've not got much of a view, have you,' the mother in the play says. A half-empty kind of person, clearly. </p> <p>This is the first time that the actresses who wear crinolines get to try them on, and suddenly walking and talking becomes amazingly difficult. You could hide a flock of goats and a small garden centre beneath Elaine C. Smith's dress. And where did all that eating and drinking come from? It's non-stop - 'Exits to kitchen carrying plates, cutlery, glasses, etc' may have disappeared as a stage direction but it exists now as a nerve-racking reality. If I ever write another play there will be no eating and drinking and everyone will wear chitons. </p> <p> <b> 11 July</b> <br> Previews begin. First preview night the audience seem as nervous as the actors. They laugh uproariously at a scene we had always thought of as tragic. I want back those little signposts saying 'this is not funny'. By the end of six previews we have grown to accept that the audience will always laugh at this particular scene. </p> <p> <b> 17 July</b> <br> A week's holiday so that it seems as if the play has finished after an incredibly short but reasonably successful run. </p> <p> <b> 25 July</b> <br> Back into rehearsals with a final draft. I am stuck with publicity. Sneak off and buy something gorgeous for the gala performance we're going to have on the last night. Am feeling very pleased with this glamorous acquisition but when I return home I have to face the Sewage Crisis - a monsoon downpour that caused the main sewer to back up. The main sewer, needless to say, runs under my house and garden, and I spend the next 24 hours cleaning other people's excrement off my patio. The puritan in me feels this must be good for me but I'm not sure how or why. </p> <p> <b> 3 August</b> <br> Press night. All this time and suddenly we're there. The Traverse is so full of flowers for the actors it looks like a funeral home. ('Or the botanical gardens,' as a more cheerful half-full sort of person says.) No one forgets their lines and (more importantly in my book) no one falls over. Audiences love the play, critics somewhat less so (it was ever thus). </p> <p> <b> 7 August</b> <br> Reviews. The good, the bad and the ugly. (And let's not forget the misogynistic and vitriolic). There are many reasons why I've never expected good reviews. For one, I have crossed genres and no one likes that ('Novelist writes play - must be bad'). Then there's that curiously British form of intellectual snobbery which proposes that if you're popular you can't be good, if you sell you must have sold out. This is insulting to readers and audiences alike. Just yesterday in the Scotsman a 'leading Scottish writer' was telling his fellow writers that if they wanted to sell books they would have to 'lower their standards'. </p> <p>Plus, it's a very busy play, a lot of plot and action ('an overstuffed trunk', 'over-egged pudding'. Thank you.) But that's the kind of writer I am and, just as I don't like spare, thin novels, I don't like spare, thin plays (and neither do audiences). And of course, if you write a play with a lot of women in it, then it's a 'woman's play'. Write a play with men in it and it's just a play. Go figure. </p> <p>Nevertheless, in case I sound like a totally empty-glass person, we do have some very lovely reviews and I am particularly taken by Michael Billington's encouraging comment that I 'have arrived at theatrical customs with a huge amount to declare' (even if it's with that somewhat overstuffed trunk). </p> <p>We have done what we set out to do, which was to write a complex, opulent and entertaining play about identity and loss. And it's been a wonderful experience, the bitchiness and jealousy far outweighed by the love and creativity and companionship of a wonderful company. And working in the theatre has felt like coming home for me. At last.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,353544,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Read Susannah Clapp's review of Adandonment here</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "June 1996 I'm encouraged by director John Tiffany to write a very short play called Nice for the Traverse Theatre. As a result of this I'm given a commission to write a longer, grown-up play - and yes, from 1996 to 2000 does seem rather a long time to have had a commission and not produced a play but it is 'one big lateness in this house', as a character in the play remarks irritably. All I know about the play in its embryonic stage is that it's set in one room and there's a ghost. But, most importantly for me (because I cannot write without one), it has a title - Abandonment. So all you have to do now is write it, J.T. says. Yes indeed, that's all. November Write the first draft of Abandonment. Complain to J.T. that it's all dialogue and dialogue isn't something I really do . Well it is now,he responds, a mite testily. I think fondly of Slava's Snowshow in which there is no dialogue at all, but, sadly, I am not not writing a play with a part for a Russian existentialist clown. 1997-1998 Spend a year trying - and failing - to write the next novel. Give up and write second draft of Abandonment . Begin to get the hang of dialogue. No longer yearn for pages of descriptive writing but am still finding it very hard to eradicate speech indicators ('remarks irritably', 'responds a mite testily' and so on.) Adverbs are a particular loss. How on earth will the actors know how this naked speech is to be played? Trust them, J.T. advises (with quite a few adverbs). And how will we ever get by without helpful little signposts for the audience indicating 'this is funny' (and conversely, and perhaps more importantly, 'this is not funny')? Write a third draft, still hanging on to all those lengthy stage directions that make directors despair - 'She looks up with interested expression on her face' or 'Exits to kitchen carry ing plates, cutlery, glasses, etc'. The play is going through its 'postmodern' stage, deconstructing all over the place, actors aware they're actors in a play and so on. Gently coaxed out of this (thank goodness). 1998 Abandon Abandonment and return to writing Emotionally Weird which, under the influence of the play, is suddenly full of dialogue. 1999 Finally finish Emotionally Weird. Write fourth draft of Abandonment. February 2000 Workshop the play. Can't get over the novelty of actors speaking words that have been two-dimensional for so long. April Fifth draft. Finally eliminate all those stage directions. May Start casting. Leave some of the casting rather late and make one actress read the script and give us an answer the day before she gets married. Are we sympathetic? No. Casting makes you strangely ruthless. Finally we have our complete cast, every one a diamond - James Cunningham, Michelle Gomez, Kathryn Howden, Patricia Kerrigan, Neil McKinven, Sheila Redi, Elaine C. Smith. June See the model of the set for the first time. Designer Georgia Sion has made an exquisitely detailed claustrophobic doll's-house room - a round Victorian sitting room that must serve as both the past and the present, a panoramic curve that moves from order into disintegration, from reality to facsimile. Start rehearsals, sitting round a table for the week going through the script with the actors, the result of which is the sixth draft which we rehearse for the next three weeks. A word in praise of actors - apart from being intelligent and resourceful and brave and all that stuff - they never show that they're bored. Perhaps they aren't but I would be if I had to keep saying the same thing again and again (especially when I might not actually like what I was saying) each time finding a different nuance, a different place to go. July Technical rehearsal. Two long days' tech, 14 hours back to back, and the first time we've seen the completed set. Feel as if I've shrunk inside the model. The window, big on the model, enormous in reality, looks out on a cloudy backcloth of galactic nebulae, the kind of view you see from the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. 'You've not got much of a view, have you,' the mother in the play says. A half-empty kind of person, clearly. This is the first time that the actresses who wear crinolines get to try them on, and suddenly walking and talking becomes amazingly difficult. You could hide a flock of goats and a small garden centre beneath Elaine C. Smith's dress. And where did all that eating and drinking come from? It's non-stop - 'Exits to kitchen carrying plates, cutlery, glasses, etc' may have disappeared as a stage direction but it exists now as a nerve-racking reality. If I ever write another play there will be no eating and drinking and everyone will wear chitons. 11 July Previews begin. First preview night the audience seem as nervous as the actors. They laugh uproariously at a scene we had always thought of as tragic. I want back those little signposts saying 'this is not funny'. By the end of six previews we have grown to accept that the audience will always laugh at this particular scene. 17 July A week's holiday so that it seems as if the play has finished after an incredibly short but reasonably successful run. 25 July Back into rehearsals with a final draft. I am stuck with publicity. Sneak off and buy something gorgeous for the gala performance we're going to have on the last night. Am feeling very pleased with this glamorous acquisition but when I return home I have to face the Sewage Crisis - a monsoon downpour that caused the main sewer to back up. The main sewer, needless to say, runs under my house and garden, and I spend the next 24 hours cleaning other people's excrement off my patio. The puritan in me feels this must be good for me but I'm not sure how or why. 3 August Press night. All this time and suddenly we're there. The Traverse is so full of flowers for the actors it looks like a funeral home. ('Or the botanical gardens,' as a more cheerful half-full sort of person says.) No one forgets their lines and (more importantly in my book) no one falls over. Audiences love the play, critics somewhat less so (it was ever thus). 7 August Reviews. The good, the bad and the ugly. (And let's not forget the misogynistic and vitriolic). There are many reasons why I've never expected good reviews. For one, I have crossed genres and no one likes that ('Novelist writes play - must be bad'). Then there's that curiously British form of intellectual snobbery which proposes that if you're popular you can't be good, if you sell you must have sold out. This is insulting to readers and audiences alike. Just yesterday in the Scotsman a 'leading Scottish writer' was telling his fellow writers that if they wanted to sell books they would have to 'lower their standards'. Plus, it's a very busy play, a lot of plot and action ('an overstuffed trunk', 'over-egged pudding'. Thank you.) But that's the kind of writer I am and, just as I don't like spare, thin novels, I don't like spare, thin plays (and neither do audiences). And of course, if you write a play with a lot of women in it, then it's a 'woman's play'. Write a play with men in it and it's just a play. Go figure. Nevertheless, in case I sound like a totally empty-glass person, we do have some very lovely reviews and I am particularly taken by Michael Billington's encouraging comment that I 'have arrived at theatrical customs with a huge amount to declare' (even if it's with that somewhat overstuffed trunk). We have done what we set out to do, which was to write a complex, opulent and entertaining play about identity and loss. And it's been a wonderful experience, the bitchiness and jealousy far outweighed by the love and creativity and companionship of a wonderful company. And working in the theatre has felt like coming home for me. At last. Read Susannah Clapp's review of Adandonment here",

I remember her as huge, though she was only nine or 10, with loose, oily curls, a blunt nose, rosy cheeks, a big white merry smile, a hearty laugh. She towers over me still, 35 years later. </p> <p>There I am, small and shrinking; wanting the ground to open so I can disappear, taking my shame with me. For the fear of all people who have been bullied is that the bully has seen something in them, sniffed out the invisible stain like a dog. She didn't pick on anyone else. She didn't pick on the girl with thick glasses, or the fat boy, or the class cry-baby or the one who still wet her knickers in moments of emotion. She picked on me. </p> <p>Jane was a prefect in the junior school. Teachers liked her. She had a group of friends whom she walked around with at break, arm in arm, skirts hoiked up above the knee, strong, gleaming legs in short white socks. She was sent to sit with our class while we did our 'silent reading' several times a week. Here, she became my tormentor. She would tell everyone they could talk, except me. I had to sit silent amid the chatter. Then she'd tell them all to be silent, except me. I was now allowed to talk; I had to talk although no one was allowed to say anything back, or even look at me. </p> <p>When my unanswered words dried up, she would put me in the corner and get my best friend (Rosemary Leeming, with long blonde plaits) to stand behind me with a ruler. If I turned round, Rosemary had to whack me. Can this be true, I wonder to myself now, or is this some gothic memory I've produced out of a calm and sunny childhood? Jane made us all write our names on the blackboard. When I spelled out N-I-C-C-I, she would jeer that I didn't know how to spell my name, what a baby! She made me spell it the more ordinary way: N-I-C-K-Y. She took away my own name. I had always been rather a confident child, a show-off and a flirt. Yet with what ease she saw beneath the surface. </p> <p>Of course, I didn't tell on Jane. I lay awake in bed at night with my secret, which blossomed in the darkness. I don't know how long it went on - perhaps not many weeks, after all. I had always loved school, but I started wanting to stay at home. How did it end? I can't remember. Perhaps I eventually broke down and 'confessed' to my parents. Perhaps my friends mentioned it to theirs. At any rate, the secret came out. I know that because one afternoon at home, the telephone rang and it was Jane, calling to apologise. Her voice was strained. She sounded as if she had been crying but I didn't believe that. Wolves don't cry. I pretended I couldn't hear what she was saying. She shouted sorry, louder and louder, sorry sorry sorry, and in the end she put the phone down. And strangely, I never recall even seeing her again, let alone being persecuted by her. She must have still been at school, striding round the playground with her friends, but I don't remember it. For me, her power had been taken away and she simply disappeared. </p> <p>I've been bullied since then, in milder forms. Picked on, excluded, like we all have - that little whispering knot of girls who snicker and fall silent when you approach. And I've watched other people being bullied, and some times I've tried to intervene, and other times I've let it happen, knowing my own timidity. Now I have four children of my own, and sometimes they have been bullied and, of course, that is the worst of all - thinking of them with their Janes, imagining them being eager and obedient with them. </p> <p>I saw a boy at my son's school being knocked around the other day - a group of children set upon him, laughing and intent. In the few moments before I intervened, I saw the way the boy lifted his arm up in a gesture of appeal, and how his face twisted with fear and shame, trying so hard not to cry. It made me feel sick at heart for him, that expression, that was almost like a smile. Children love to belong and will do almost anything not to be excluded. They learn to conform. They mock the ones who stick out. Children will do almost anything not to be bullied; they'll let it happen to others, just so it is not them. They will become the bully themselves, just so they are not the bully's victim. Difference is dangerous. Cowardice makes us cruel. A Jane in all of us.</p>",

He is an official war artist, sent to document the shipyards of Port Glasgow on the Clyde. His fringe is harried by the east-coast wind. His jersey looks quite inadequate. There he stands, struggling to keep his drawings secure, a tiny Alan Bennett surrounded by mighty shipbuilders. </p> <p>Not that Spencer painted them that way: his workers are hardly heroic. There are eight friezes in the Port Glasgow cycle, each crammed with figures absorbed in the task of hammering, hauling, soldering and riveting the disparate parts of a gigantic ship. Many hundreds of workers, yet not a single man of steel among them - not one Achilles or Ajax to dismay the enemy, as the War Artists' Committee advised. Diego Rivera would have cast them as patriotic champions, blue-denimed fighters for freedom. Stanley Spencer painted the builders as homely gents in mufflers, cloth caps, herringbone breeks and, of course, Fair Isle sweaters. </p> <p>This doesn't make the paintings anti-propagandist - there isn't a smutch of grease or sweat on these faces. Nor is there any sense of the fraught industrial relations at Port Glasgow, or the future of these ships as floating graveyards for the war-dead. What fascinates Spencer is the very thing that absorbs his subjects - a nice bit of craftsmanship. That's as likely to be the cobbling in a boot or the knitting in a waistcoat as the joinery of the worker who wears them. Devotion outweighs purpose. Spencer thought the shipbuilders were like the angels in Paradise Lost - it wasn't their usual job, but sometimes they were forced to bombard Satan's army with rocks. </p> <p>What Spencer made of these figures is itself a religious revelation, oxyacetylene angels on the upper tier, scenes from the Bible below. It is by far the most complicated drama he ever painted and the Portrait Gallery has displayed it to perfection. For the first time, the friezes are hung as Spencer intended - the long, narrow panels, sometimes six metres in length, configured around a central altarpiece like the cycles in a medieval chapel. </p> <p>So you see that some of the carpenters are building an ark, its giant, fish shape doubling as Jonah's whale. Or that the men pulling on guy ropes recall the Raising of the Cross, while the women, with their shroud-like sails, are enacting the Deposition. There is no Christ, just as there is no final image of the ship. But in the altarpiece a team of apostles draws a white-hot bolt from the furnace, shielding their eyes against the supernatural light. This Jerusalem-on-Clyde is both ancient and modern, quoting from Giotto and Mantegna while marrying man and machine with near-futurist dynamics. Men with blowtorches are hoisted high like spacemen, rotating in the shipyard darkness. Welders peer down through their visors as if seeing the earth below, their bodies transfigured with otherworldly brightness. </p> <p>The Man with the Pram paints himself into this industrial panorama, a worried figure watching the Passion unfold. But Spencer also saw what happened next in a midnight vision as he walked through the civic graveyard. </p> <p>The shipbuilding friezes are always shown alone.

He'd call me from their house and switch to calling me 'Bob' when she walked into the room. He even called me daily from their holiday in Turkey. And every time he called, he'd repeat the same old thing: 'I'm sorry. I wish this had never happened. I want us to get back together again.'</p> <p>And so I put the revenge plan in action. For three months, I became 'the other woman', with lunchtime meetings and afternoon sex with my ex-husband. 'I'm going to leave her,' he'd keep telling me. 'Yeah, whatever,' I'd reply. But he did. He threw her out, for me. There were tears and hours of talking before he told her to go and never return. He didn't tell her why.

A couple of months went by with news of the ex-friend filtering through to me: that she was looking pretty rough, wasn't coping well at work and that my ex-husband's actions were a complete mystery to her.</p> <p>In short, I'd caused her heartache. Not as much as she had caused me, but enough. Besides, I was starting to feel charitable. My life was back on track. Part one of the plan was complete. My ex-husband started making plans for me to move in with him and I went along with them, all the while knowing I wasn't going anywhere.

      "body": "<p>I can't prove it, but taking the children on holiday must surely be right up there among the top five triggers for mental torment along with divorce, moving house, running out of toilet paper, and not being left any money following the sudden death of a well off relative. Of course, everyone puts a brave face on it for the sake of the holiday snaps, and we do make a point of bringing back hand-tooled plaster reproductions of Mount Snowdon for people with less fortunate taste than ourselves, and sending postcards to our mums joking about the typhoon that hilariously turned our caravan upside down while we were out trying to find a McDonald's in Brittany. That's all part of the fun. I'm not saying it can't be fun. The problem is... well, it's not exactly relaxing, is it? </p> <p>Gone are the days when you might have spent the afternoon vegetating on a sun lounger with a chilled margarita and the Daily Mirror , or wandering around the Uffizi catching up on neoclassicism, or perhaps tramping the dappled byways of the Dordogne, sojourning at a homely auberge for a spot of boeuf, burgundy, bed, brioche and non-reproductive sexual intercourse. But that was then. </p> <p>Now we are parents. It turns out that children don't much like sitting around reading yesterday's papers or being enlightened on the system of arts patronage under the Medicis or being taken on long walks with nothing to look at but haystacks. They're forever wanting you to make sandcastles or get wet in a variety of ways or watch them skim pebbles. And while it's true that there's about five minutes in your life when your first baby can still pass as hand luggage and it is theoretically possible to eat in a restaurant without stopping to breastfeed or wipe the sick off your shoulder, your days are numbered. This year the Amalfi coast, next year Bournemouth. </p> <p>My wife's friend's sister Carol, a newly single parent who has just got back from 10 days in Norfolk with Bella, her two-year-old daughter, says: 'What I miss are those warm, balmy evenings strolling around some small mediterranean town, deciding where to eat, dropping into a bar for an aperitif... just being able to chill out. I used to be quite snooty about English seaside holidays,' she adds, 'but it's surprising how quickly you can get used to windbreaks and deckchairs and sand in your food - and it is less hassle than going abroad for me at the moment.' </p> <p>Carol shared a cottage with her single-parent friend Janine and Janine's toddler Dennis. 'I had this mad idea that it would be a bit of a girls' holiday together - Janine's parents came for the first weekend and I thought they might babysit, but they went out to the pub instead! And Bella and Dennis didn't get on very well. Bella kept hitting Dennis with her tennis racket and stealing his toys, which made me tense, but then he'd be forever standing on the table or getting yoghurt on the sofa. I did think Janine could have been a fraction more hands-on, but what could I say?You know how it gets if you're even minutely critical of someone else's parenting techniques. Dennis would be allowed to stay up till midnight, whereas I'd normally put Bella to bed at eight, which was impossible with Dennis still running around. And Bella was still getting me out of bed at 6.30 every morning, so I was getting the worst of both worlds. I came back needing another holiday. </p> <p>'But it was fun too,' she adds. 'We did sometimes manage to get the two of them to play together while we sunbathed or had a coffee. And with the grandparents there for a couple of days, it was nice to be part of a strange hybrid family. I did feel Bella was at least getting some experience of a typical ghastly English holiday.' </p> <p>But going away with another family can numb the pain, especially if you have more children than they do. This year we took our four to Devon for a week with our old neighbours and chums John and Fiona, who have just the one cool, together, undemanding 12-year-old daughter, Harriet. Of course they are used to a less frenzied pace of life than us, but they soon got used to being woken up at dawn by our three-year-old, and didn't seem to mind the ambient whining soundtrack and new bulk cooking rota. Being in a spacious, well-resourced environment helped, especially one with its own corkscrew. Because we did manage to salvage the later part of our evenings to sit around drinking and making fun of John's range of surfwear. Fiona, who is a primary school teacher and accustomed to blocking out peripheral noise, read her usual eight books during our stay. Even I got to page 28 of Philip Roth's American Pastoral, which is a quite dense novel, chiefly about gloves. </p> <p>The days, however, were full of not sitting down. It was all right for John, who enjoys nothing more than splashing about in a frogman's outfit and discovering his inner child. I have no inner child. Just outer ones. 'You shouldn't expect to relax,' says my wife. 'The holiday is for the children. Think of them.' </p> <p>She's right, of course. I ought to be getting the hang of it by now. The thing is, it doesn't matter how many hours you spend watching them hold their breath underwater or how much money you give them to waste on machines, they'll always discover something they haven't moaned about yet. Do holidays have to be so fraught with anxiety? Are they like Christmas in that respect? </p> <p>Dorothy Rowe, the psychologist, writer, and something of an expert on things that get you down, says: 'Holidays can be very challenging. You can get bored, the kids are difficult, perhaps someone gets ill. You're in an unfamiliar environment. Holidays are supposed to be wonderful, but a lot of kids would rather be at home where they know what's what. It's up to adults to make it work, but then it's down to adults when things go wrong. That's what parents are for - for the children to blame.' </p> <p>'It's all a bit depressing,' I say. </p> <p>'Depression is something else,' she says. 'But it can be very dispiriting.' </p> <p>And, as Louise and Nick (not their real names) have discovered in the last couple of years, there's nothing like having a surly teenager in the family to make things worse. 'If you don't get it right, it can be an absolute nightmare,' says Louise, who has two boys, eight and 10, and Gemma, 15. 'The boys are easy to please and Nick is very good at getting any nearby children together for football or rounders. But we can't expect Gemma to play rounders now. She'd just hang around scowling and being difficult for two weeks and wanting to go home - or, worse, to a fairground.' The answer, says Louise, is to a) go abroad so Gemma can at least hold her head up at school - France is ideally situated, being right next door to Britain; b) book into a large, raucous Eurocamp or similar with a nightly disco and boys with earrings and tattoos; c) open a bottle of Chablis. </p> <p>This year the family went to a site near Bordeaux - the same place they went last year. 'Both times Gemma has made friends with other teenagers. After the first day we hardly saw her, because she was out enjoying herself and being independent. She loved it. This year we let her invite a friend from school along, which was better for her, though slightly worse for us, in terms of privacy and space. But I suppose we're beginning to realise that every holiday she has with us now could be her last.' </p> <p>My wife says we should enjoy the children while we can. Of course, she agrees that holidays can drive you scatty but she says they provide a family with a history of shared memories. They are like magical milestones on the highway of routine. Okay, she didn't actually say that last bit. But it's true that we do still talk about the trout that our eldest caught in France, and the bats that lived behind the shutters, and Bridget the camel in Tunisia and how the youngest lost his shoe in the souk and how our little trio of cuties won the fancy dress as mice in the Isle of Wight. </p> <p>And the funny thing is... I can't seem to remember any of the bad bits.</p>",

That's all part of the fun. I'm not saying it can't be fun. The problem is... well, it's not exactly relaxing, is it? Gone are the days when you might have spent the afternoon vegetating on a sun lounger with a chilled margarita and the Daily Mirror , or wandering around the Uffizi catching up on neoclassicism, or perhaps tramping the dappled byways of the Dordogne, sojourning at a homely auberge for a spot of boeuf, burgundy, bed, brioche and non-reproductive sexual intercourse. But that was then. Now we are parents. It turns out that children don't much like sitting around reading yesterday's papers or being enlightened on the system of arts patronage under the Medicis or being taken on long walks with nothing to look at but haystacks. They're forever wanting you to make sandcastles or get wet in a variety of ways or watch them skim pebbles. And while it's true that there's about five minutes in your life when your first baby can still pass as hand luggage and it is theoretically possible to eat in a restaurant without stopping to breastfeed or wipe the sick off your shoulder, your days are numbered. This year the Amalfi coast, next year Bournemouth. My wife's friend's sister Carol, a newly single parent who has just got back from 10 days in Norfolk with Bella, her two-year-old daughter, says: 'What I miss are those warm, balmy evenings strolling around some small mediterranean town, deciding where to eat, dropping into a bar for an aperitif... just being able to chill out. I used to be quite snooty about English seaside holidays,' she adds, 'but it's surprising how quickly you can get used to windbreaks and deckchairs and sand in your food - and it is less hassle than going abroad for me at the moment.' Carol shared a cottage with her single-parent friend Janine and Janine's toddler Dennis. 'I had this mad idea that it would be a bit of a girls' holiday together - Janine's parents came for the first weekend and I thought they might babysit, but they went out to the pub instead! And Bella and Dennis didn't get on very well. Bella kept hitting Dennis with her tennis racket and stealing his toys, which made me tense, but then he'd be forever standing on the table or getting yoghurt on the sofa. I did think Janine could have been a fraction more hands-on, but what could I say?You know how it gets if you're even minutely critical of someone else's parenting techniques. Dennis would be allowed to stay up till midnight, whereas I'd normally put Bella to bed at eight, which was impossible with Dennis still running around. And Bella was still getting me out of bed at 6.30 every morning, so I was getting the worst of both worlds. I came back needing another holiday. 'But it was fun too,' she adds. 'We did sometimes manage to get the two of them to play together while we sunbathed or had a coffee. And with the grandparents there for a couple of days, it was nice to be part of a strange hybrid family. I did feel Bella was at least getting some experience of a typical ghastly English holiday.' But going away with another family can numb the pain, especially if you have more children than they do. This year we took our four to Devon for a week with our old neighbours and chums John and Fiona, who have just the one cool, together, undemanding 12-year-old daughter, Harriet. Of course they are used to a less frenzied pace of life than us, but they soon got used to being woken up at dawn by our three-year-old, and didn't seem to mind the ambient whining soundtrack and new bulk cooking rota. Being in a spacious, well-resourced environment helped, especially one with its own corkscrew. Because we did manage to salvage the later part of our evenings to sit around drinking and making fun of John's range of surfwear. Fiona, who is a primary school teacher and accustomed to blocking out peripheral noise, read her usual eight books during our stay. Even I got to page 28 of Philip Roth's American Pastoral, which is a quite dense novel, chiefly about gloves. The days, however, were full of not sitting down. It was all right for John, who enjoys nothing more than splashing about in a frogman's outfit and discovering his inner child. I have no inner child. Just outer ones. 'You shouldn't expect to relax,' says my wife. 'The holiday is for the children. Think of them.' She's right, of course. I ought to be getting the hang of it by now. The thing is, it doesn't matter how many hours you spend watching them hold their breath underwater or how much money you give them to waste on machines, they'll always discover something they haven't moaned about yet. Do holidays have to be so fraught with anxiety? Are they like Christmas in that respect? Dorothy Rowe, the psychologist, writer, and something of an expert on things that get you down, says: 'Holidays can be very challenging. You can get bored, the kids are difficult, perhaps someone gets ill. You're in an unfamiliar environment. Holidays are supposed to be wonderful, but a lot of kids would rather be at home where they know what's what. It's up to adults to make it work, but then it's down to adults when things go wrong. That's what parents are for - for the children to blame.' 'It's all a bit depressing,' I say. 'Depression is something else,' she says. 'But it can be very dispiriting.' And, as Louise and Nick (not their real names) have discovered in the last couple of years, there's nothing like having a surly teenager in the family to make things worse. 'If you don't get it right, it can be an absolute nightmare,' says Louise, who has two boys, eight and 10, and Gemma, 15. 'The boys are easy to please and Nick is very good at getting any nearby children together for football or rounders. But we can't expect Gemma to play rounders now. She'd just hang around scowling and being difficult for two weeks and wanting to go home - or, worse, to a fairground.' The answer, says Louise, is to a) go abroad so Gemma can at least hold her head up at school - France is ideally situated, being right next door to Britain; b) book into a large, raucous Eurocamp or similar with a nightly disco and boys with earrings and tattoos; c) open a bottle of Chablis. This year the family went to a site near Bordeaux - the same place they went last year. 'Both times Gemma has made friends with other teenagers. After the first day we hardly saw her, because she was out enjoying herself and being independent. She loved it. This year we let her invite a friend from school along, which was better for her, though slightly worse for us, in terms of privacy and space. But I suppose we're beginning to realise that every holiday she has with us now could be her last.' My wife says we should enjoy the children while we can. Of course, she agrees that holidays can drive you scatty but she says they provide a family with a history of shared memories. They are like magical milestones on the highway of routine. Okay, she didn't actually say that last bit. But it's true that we do still talk about the trout that our eldest caught in France, and the bats that lived behind the shutters, and Bridget the camel in Tunisia and how the youngest lost his shoe in the souk and how our little trio of cuties won the fancy dress as mice in the Isle of Wight. And the funny thing is... I can't seem to remember any of the bad bits.",

      "body": "<p>He calls himself 'the happy environmentalist', making it sound like the title of a fairy story. Sitting in the living-room of his beautiful house in Cheltenham - light floating in through the tall, clean windows; on the shelves books, children's videos, board games; on the cream walls two square, bright paintings of blue skies and blue seas; all around the room photographs of his two daughters smiling, his wife smiling, himself smiling from under his locks of dark hair - this seems a world of well-tempered tranquillity, prosperous contentment and a particularly English ease. </p> <p>Yet the worlds Jonathon Porritt deals with are, as he says himself, ones of 'deep gloom and darkest dismay', where the news is very rarely good and often apocalyptic: poisoned beaches, toxic air, leaking gases, endangered species, a torn sky, a dangerous sun. So, he says, 'happiness can seem such an illegitimate emotion; optimism strange amid such deep, dark gloom. Happiness is quite psychologically complicated for someone like me. A lot of my friends are worn down by the literal despair that they feel at living with this pattern of destruction. In the face of dire news, people may easily become paralysed and feel powerless.' He smiles with great charm. 'Not me. I have never felt despair. I remain an optimist. You see, I think I can change things - still, even now, I think I can change what is happening.' </p> <p>Jonathon Porritt has just been appointed by Tony Blair as the Government's key adviser on sustainable development; he will chair the 15-strong Sustainable Development Committee. He's rather modest, and mildly rueful, about his new position, which he calls 'a monstrous challenge'. He doesn't think that he was their first choice. 'In fact, I wasn't even a candidate at all,' he says. 'I've never had any internal dealings with the Labour Party. I've always been critical of them. I have not sought to defend this party's record, and I won't begin doing that now. I'm not going to be suddenly going, \"oooh, I got it all wrong, all along\". I've always been dark green and radical. Now here I am on the inside, or sort of. I have to report on the Government's performance on sustainable development, and you can't be on the inside doing that. You can't be too close, or there would be no usefulness in it for them; no credibility for others. I nailed that down with Michael Meacher, whom I have always admired. It will be a critical dialogue.' </p> <p>When he was invited to do the job, he was 'very surprised indeed. I said, \"I'm still a member of the Green Party, you know\". They said, \"no problem\". I said, \"what if I campaign for the radical greenies at the next election?\" They said, \"well, it might sit a mite uneasily; this is an independent body\". I said, \"what if I make critical speeches about the Government?\" They said, \"Jonathon, that's part of your job\".' He thinks that he can be outside and inside, all at once. </p> <p>In fact, that's pretty much what he's been all of his working life: inside and outside, establishment and radical, friend to the powerless and to the Prince of Wales. He was born to be a Sir - his father, who died eight years ago, was Baron Porritt of Wanganui and Hampstead. He was educated at Eton, where he was 'very happy; I had a wonderful time, I'm afraid - my whole childhood was very happy and untroubled... no torments there'. </p> <p>He went to Oxford, where he obtained a first-class degree in modern languages. His sister works in finance; his brother is a property developer. Nothing prepared him for being an environmental activist and a thorn in the side of the establishment to which he belongs by birth and manner, except for his childhood love of wildlife. After Oxford, he started training as a barrister, but it bored him, so he spent the next 10 years teaching at a London comprehensive, during which time he became active in the Green Party, becoming its co-chair in 1980. </p> <p>He left teaching and the chair of the Green Party (which by then was a wrangling and rivalrous organisation headed towards its Sara Parkin farrago) to become director of Friends of the Earth, which he built up into the face of 'respectable radicalism', firmly grounded in science and fact and setting its face against wacky and mystical environmentalism. He has written books on environmental issues, presented television series on them; he has chaired the United Nations environmental and development committee for the UK. In 1996, he became a founder and director of Forum for the Future, a charity campaigning for solutions to today's environmental problems. The Forum tends to highlight good news rather than pointing out the bad, and its members include Richard Rogers, Jonathan Dimbleby and Will Hutton. A lot of its work is done with large companies - if Friends of the Earth was a bottom-up organisation, Forum for the Future is a top-down one. </p> <p>The great and the good, I say, and he smiles at the buried question mark. </p> <p>'This conflict has been true all my life. I don't see it as a tension, but as a set of opportunities. I have always felt that. The fact that I know how the establishment world works, because I was born into it and educated into it, has not been a disadvantage to me or the organisations I've worked with. The opposite is true: it has helped me to do much more useful work. At Friends of the Earth, being at ease with the people who were on the inside track, in the corridors of power, it was plain useful for us. I could take this radical message to people who simply wouldn't have listened to others, but who would listen to me. </p> <p>'I'm upfront about this. I've used my privilege to get greater leverage for green ideas. I've done it calculatingly. I have turned it to good effect. It's not complicated for me. I feel no guilt.' He adds, after a pause, that it is, however, 'much too easy to forget what it is like to be powerless and to have no voice. I am familiar with worlds where people don't just forget - they have never known. They are blind to injustice, inequality, poverty. Things are genuinely invisible to them'. </p> <p>But he insists that 'that is absolutely not true for me. I will not allow myself to forget what my work is about and be seduced by power. I just won't. I still feel the same way about it as I did when I started. I can remember the first impulse as clearly as yesterday. I am,' he continues, 'an environmentalist not because I care about Nature, which I very much do, but because I care more about the human species. I care about things like social justice, fairness, equality, human potential - and survival. Part of the quality of life is our relationship with the natural world. Diminish that and we diminish ourselves. There are other activists who start from the other way round - that what matters is the natural world. Well, I think I have a huge sense of its spiritual significance. My attitude is not just utilitarian. But I see nature through a human lens.' He laughs: 'Anyway, you should try talking about spiritual things at Friends of the Earth; they'd shout you down in a blaze of materialistic fury. They are a rationalist, instrumentalist organisation. That's why they are so effective; they don't get cluttered up with, you know, stuff.' </p> <p>He respects science, but only so far. Poetry creeps into his analyses. He is scornful of scientists such as Richard Dawkins, and his anti-religious, absolutist fervour. He hates the great divide between scientists and the rest of us - C.P. Snow's famous two cultures, and the yawning gap between them; the hole into which the world will fall. His latest book, Playing Safe: Science and the Environment (Thames and Hudson) contains a wealth of scientific information about the parlous state of the natural word, but also several swipes at arrogant scientists and their assumption that science is authoritative, objective, value-free and the last word. </p> <p>He was one of the people who turned Friends of the Earth into a respectable, science-led place, but he bemoans its dry-eyed materialism. He loves James Lovelock and the Gaia principle; he calls for holistic solutions; he approves of the Prince of Wales's dogged championing of 'the sacred'; he can't stand media cynics; he talks about cosmic harmony and psychic disconnection, and about synthetic chemicals and sewerage systems. The world for him is not just a great rock but a 'whispering pond'. </p> <p>'I do believe in a world that is a created world and not just an accident. God is probably the best word to describe that force. Well, I know it doesn't correlate much with what most people mean by God. And since I don't believe you can have a pick'n'mix Christianity, then I'd probably subscribe to the Christian faith. But as a Christian, I'd better tell you I fail on every count. I don't, for a start, believe in life after death. I do believe in reincarnation, by which I mean a literal, physical reincarnation, so that when we die we are promptly recycled into a million different organisms.' </p> <p>In other words, he believes in decay. 'Yes. I love the thought. It thrills me. It turns me on. I revel in the idea that I'll be incorporated back into the world like that. I love the idea of being buried in a grove, a tree growing out of my heart. I'm not at all scared of death. Even less after seeing my father die. He was 92, after all, but none the less, he was very gentle, very accepting. We talked a lot about his death, and he thought there was nothing you needed to make a fuss about. I don't worry about dying at all.' </p> <p>So where are the things that trip him up? 'Hmmm. Well, getting a balance. Some things have fallen by the way in my life. In my early adulthood, I had a really strong network of friends. I felt passionately about friendship. That's gone, if I'm honest. I've sacrificed that to family and work - I work tremendously hard in the week, and I spend every weekend with my family and I protect my space with them; that always takes priority. But I worry about friendships; it troubles me.' </p> <p>Other things, he says, do not trouble him. He is lucky, cheerful, optimistic. Environmental work creates 'fear, guilt, anger. It touches on the darkest places of your psyche. And I've worked there all my life, but I do not feel despair. And now, with the Forum and its emphasis on best practice, I work with other things - like joy, fulfilment, success. It taps into other parts of human energy. And I think, I really do, that in some ways things are getting better. The pattern of destruction, well, the news remains uniformly bad, and often getting worse. But in terms of awareness, things are better. It's an area that is not so measurable, but I believe there's a growing commitment to changed behaviour, and a readiness for change. It's very different from the Eighties, let alone the Seventies.' </p> <p>There's such joy, he says, in the business of protecting the earth. 'It's not a crabby, grim business at all. The essence of it is joy.' If he ever does get a bit depressed at the enormity of the task, 'I just get out there, into nature. I reconnect.' He chuckles. 'I hug those trees. I'm very flaky, you know. God knows what the Government's done. Appointed a complete flake. </p> <p>'Maybe what I'll do after this is to start chaining myself to railings again. I'd like that sense of life being a cycle. I could loop round, back to where I started. Into the corridors of power and out the other side, chained to the railings and shouting for change.'</p>",

I'd like that sense of life being a cycle. I could loop round, back to where I started. Into the corridors of power and out the other side, chained to the railings and shouting for change.'",

While undeniably watchable, Big Brother fails to engage emotions because the pressure for contestants to compete, to be 'on' effectively 24 hours a day, means that any sort of a relationship they appear to construct with each other is fundamentally dishonest and therefore as exhaustingly unedifying as watching a series of audition tapes for an MTV presenting job. </p> <p> We can play at virtual voyeurism with this lot but we shouldn't fool ourselves: they're semi-pro media bunnies bouncing on cue inside their televised hutch - if they were prepared to sabotage their performances to reveal a real them, they'd be at it like rabbits, too. No, if this week you wanted televisual voyeurism featuring some truly awkward fledgling relationships then you needed to see the delightfully candid, funny, touching and entertainingly naive documentary, Blokes . </p> <p> The young director/narrator, Cassie Allward, claimed she had set out to make a film about contemporary blokedom, with particular emphasis on male friendship. To this end she was introduced to Jack and Chris, a pair of sweetly feckless twentysomethings who agreed to be filmed for her project. However, Cassie rather waved goodbye to her objectivity when, on the night they first met, she snogged Jack and then went to bed with Chris. (Well, it was New Year's Eve). </p> <p> This made for a better film, though: Cassie carried on having a desultory sort of relationship with Chris, while recognising that she much preferred the 'more appropriate' Jack; and Jack - though patently keen on Cassie - stuck doggedly to the unwritten code of honour: Thou dost not shag one's best mate's bird - at least not until he's dumped her. By necessity, Cassie sought sanctuary behind her lens, instigating needy conversations with Chris which, she acknowledged, indicated that 'all he wanted to do was have sex and play on his [record] decks'. </p> <p> 'I don't want you to, like, get too into me,' said Chris, who had some intimacy issues. </p> <p> 'Do you know exactly what you want?' pondered Cassie. </p> <p> 'In which domain?' wondered Chris. </p> <p> 'In the domain of sex and love...' </p> <p> 'No, blatantly [sic] not. But there's still that kind of natural desire to find a soulmate...' </p> <p> These boys, a pair of hopelessly ricocheting emotional pinballs, were brimful of casual misogyny and wildly unrealisable romantic dreams, while Cassie herself was a tangled web-weaver of considerable skill (she should meet Big Brother 's Nick). In the end, though, it all went pear-shaped: Jack gave up and moved to Brighton in pursuit of another girl, while Chris just gave up. </p> <p> Male friendships - and competitiveness - came under equally intense scrutiny in Gold Fever, the first of a four-part series looking at the three-year preparation by Britain's coxless four rowing team. Persuaded to have a stab at a potentially record-breaking fifth Olympic gold medal, Steve Redgrave again teamed up with Matthew Pinsent and enlisted newcomers James Cracknell and Tim Foster in a bid to, as Pinsent put it, 'pull a very sizable rabbit out of a very small hat' in Sydney next month. Much misleading glamour was implied by the opening title sequence - a doppel ganger for the current Seat Leon ad - which concentrated on the extremely attractively-proportioned foursome sweating in artfully lit pop-vid monochrome to the accompaniment of a testosterone-bonkers guitar solo. Though there were, admittedly, numerous distracting shots throughout the film of abdominal-crunching and bicep-pumping, there was also some insight into the process of pursuing whatever it is that lies somewhere beyond excellence. </p> <p> Less than an hour in the company of the borderline-dour Redgrave and one could see that the life of a top-flight pro sportsman in the twilight of his career is no laughing matter. Freshly diagnosed with diabetes, Redgrave effectively shrugged and got on with it. </p> <p> Later, hovering over his newborn son, he inquired 'am I going to row?', which sounded like a pretty rhetorical sort of question to both me and Mrs Redgrave - 'If you want to,' she said quietly, babe in arms, two small daughters causing havoc nearby. This was either heroic dedication or borderline insanity. </p> <p> 'It's difficult for all of them to get the balance right between rowing and relationships,' conceded the voiceover - including, apparently, the relationship between each member of the crew. </p> <p> There was the collective sigh of disappointment (followed by an immediate breakdown in communications) between the four men when Tim (of the irritating half-smile and slightly wild streak - cigar-smoking, for example), accidentally stuck his arm through a window and severed some tendons. Matt Pinsent was 'pissed off because that sort of thing is controllable', and even Tim admitted: 'I'd be pretty annoyed with me if I were them.' </p> <p> The rest of us can't really claim to be of the same species as these burnished, physically superhuman, emotionally constipated sportsmen - but, by God, you ended up wanting them to win. They do it so we don't have to. 'This is why I do it!' Pinsent had crowed as the team rowed to victory in the world championships in France in 1997. A sentiment echoed heartily by Dave 'Devilfish' (no, we didn't find out why) Ulliot, professional poker player, greyhound owners Pat and Nicky Chambers, committed gambler Sir Clement Freud, and Glaswegian bingo and slot machine addict Betty - the first four subjects of BBC2's entertaining series, Jackpot. </p> <p> My one major criticism about Jackpot is that there was simply far too much winning going on: despite some substantial losses en route, Dave was several grand ahead by the end of the programme and, after a heartwarming parental scene in which he played blackjack (for cash) with his (very young) sons, was preparing to head for Vegas.</p> <p>Meanwhile, after a disastrous season, Pat and Nicky (and Droopy's Rivero) won their first greyhound 'classic', the Romford Puppy Cup; Sir Clement lost on the ponies at a point-to-point in Pytchley, but watched his own horse make up for it by winning at Chepstow; and even Betty, who pitches up to play the slots at the Mecca Bingo first thing every Monday morning ('it's a bit quiet') and could easily be identified as the one with A Problem, finished late on Monday night \u00a340 up on her \u00a3100 stake, despite losing at the bingo. Statistically the odds were surely against quite this much winning going on, though admittedly the series is called Jackpot , not Bankruptcy. </p> <p> 'You're Mussolini/ You're Mrs Sweeny/ You're Camembert...' sang Cole Porter - though, so far, only Camembert has survived with its reputation intact, as the Duchess of Argyll, the former Mrs Sweeny, ended up famously disgraced and, by the end of her life, clearly as bankrupt financially as she had been deemed to be morally. This Secret History also revealed (courtesy of a deliciously lugubrious Geoffrey Palmer voiceover) not only the identity of the famous 'Headless Man' - shamed, though not named, by the Duke in his divorce petition - but also the fact that, just like Posh Spice, the young Margaret Argyll was never photographed smiling.

Gore was being packaged to them as the young man who had just returned from his stint in Vietnam - wearing his country's uniform although he bitterly criticised its war - now making his way in the world free from the overbearing family tradition of politics. In contrast to the cynical realpolitik practiced by his father, Senator Albert Gore I, Al Gore II had studied esoteric spiritualism. He was a decent enough reporter too - he pursued a local corruption case all the way to a court hearing (although the target was acquitted). </p> <p>But the package was a deceptive one. Had he really wanted to go into journalism, the Harvard-educated Gore could have walked into other, more prestigious newsrooms than that which happened to have been in his father's political back-pocket in Nashville. The editor of the Nashville Tennessean was John Siegenthaler, who employed celebrity interns who would enhance his own contacts in Washington. </p> <p>In Vietnam, Gore's father had been able to pull a few strings (although without such sordid efficiency as George Bush's) and secured Gore a job as an army reporter. Accordingly, he had been mollycoddled around, a safe distance from the action which he reported in vivid detail from second-hand accounts. 'Gore was not the journalist type,' recalls his former colleague on the desk, Phil Sullivan. 'It didn't seem like that was what he was setting out to do. Siegenthaler saw him as someone who was going into politics.' </p> <p>But although his colleagues knew exactly what he was up to, Gore himself could have had no idea that the more relaxed and apparently self-confident summer intern sitting at the next desk would, in two decades time, be the man to whom he would turn for yet another in the long series of makeovers that would define his career: Carter Eskew, 'message guru' of the current campaign, laboratory technician of the present-day GM Gore and Svengali of the LA convention. </p> <p>It is hard to know which aspects of Al Gore's life are fact and which are fanciful, or indeed whether there is any difference between the two. Gore himself plays along with the entwinement, turning even the rawest and most intimate moments of his life - such as his own son's scrape with death in a car accident - into theatrics, part of the electoral strategy. </p> <p>The packaging of Al Gore as President of the United States began when he was still in utero. On the day Gore was born, the Nashville Tennessean hailed the birth on page one: 'Well, Mr Gore, Here He Is', with the Knoxville News Sentinel adding only a year or two later: 'There may be another Gore on his way to the political pinnacle.' </p> <p>Gore grew up not in Tennessee but in what is now the Ritz Carlton Hotel on Embassy Row in Washington DC, attending an \u00e9lite prep school and spending summers on the tobacco farm in his father's home state. He played with a toy submarine in the Senate swimming-pool and bounced on President Nixon's lap. Albert Snr was a rags-to-riches, Scots-Irish politician, a New Dealer unafraid of unpopular positing and ultimately defeated after an 18-year career only when Nixon unleashed a slush of illegal finance against him, as revealed by the Watergate papers. Like his son, he enjoyed taking the ethical high ground and like his son he betrayed it. But it was Gore's mother, Pauline, who claimed the initial packaging of her son - 'I trained them both,' she said of Alberts I and II, 'and I did a better job on my son than I did on my husband.' </p> <p>The most striking thing about packaging Al Gore is the regularity with which it happens and the extent of the metamorphoses. The most dramatic was the apparent conversion from new-age eco-catastrophist to Vice-President in 1992 and, more recently, from a woodentop with as much political razzmatazz as a traffic jam to something from Sopranos central casting. </p> <p>The task in 1992 was particularly daunting and almost effective. Gore pre sented a curious figure at the time, as expressed in his book, Earth in the Balance . It was published at a time when politicians were full of foreboding about the various apocalypses of global warming, over-population and ozone-depletion and making routine pilgrimages to the Amazon rainforest. </p> <p>Gore had been understandably affected by his son's narrow scrape with death after a car hit the child as the family was leaving a Baltimore Orioles baseball game. He had immersed himself in alternative psychotherapy, new-age thought and the fad philosophy of Gaia, popular among right-wing eco-catastrophists, suggesting that the human race is merely part of a single, natural organism. </p> <p>'It cannot be accidental,' wrote Gore in one of his more wayward passages, 'that the percentage of salt in our bloodstreams is the same as the percentage in the oceans of the world.' Gore laments mankind's alienation from this natural order, putting the blame squarely on Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Quite apart from its intellectual absurdity, Gore's position had two curiosities: the fact that it did not put off the embryonic Clinton administration and its brazen disingenuousness. </p> <p>On his 1998 tax return, Al Gore lists a $20,000 royalty payment from the Union Zinc Company for the right to mine zinc on his farm in Tennessee. The income, which has netted Gore $450,000 over the years, is the legacy of Gore Snr's lucrative relationship and joint ventures with fraudulent tycoon and Soviet agent, Armand Hammer, also chief executive of the environmentally controversial Occidental Petroleum Company. Among other ironies, Hammer was caught making illegal contributions to Nixon, used to topple Gore Snr. Hammer and Gore Snr enjoyed a two-way deal: Hammer boasted that he had Gore in his 'back-pocket'; he found protection from anti-communist investigations and open doors in Washington; Gore Snr secured campaign funds, a six-figure directorship upon retirement and donations for his son's Congressional campaigns. </p> <p>After hosting Gore and Tipper at innumerable parties, and being Al's guest at Ronald Reagan's inauguration in 1987, Hammer died in 1990. But the $20,000 a year was a handsome supplement to what Gore complained were 'slave wages' on the Tennessean , and still listed in 1992 as his most important source of income after his salary, now eclipsed by the $1.1 million in royalties from Earth in the Balance . </p> <p>The relationship between Gore and Occidental has remained a mutually advantageous one. Occidental loaned $100,000 to the Clinton-Gore inaugural committee in 1992, and has donated some $500,000 in 'soft money' to the Democratic Party since Gore made it on to the ticket. </p> <p>This was the administration-in-waiting that decided it needed Al Gore on the ticket. When he took the initial call from scout Warren Christopher, Gore was attending the Rio Earth Summit in 1991, waving his copy of Earth in the Balance . Baby-boomer Clinton liked the generational chemistry with Gore, and the Vietnam 'record' which, on paper, contrasted with his own. Gore appealed to the 'new Democrat' right wing for a number of reasons. He had been recruited by the party as an attack dog to see off Jesse Jackson's candidacy in 1988 and had done a good enough job. Even then, Clinton also needed someone with a stable marriage to offset his embarrassment over Gennifer Flowers. </p> <p>Gore was duly put through the mill, drilled into shape even by people who disliked him at the political core of Clinton's campaign: Hillary, James Carville and George Stephanopoulos. He was worked over by speech coaches and a ballet choreographer, who counselled him on his awkward movements. The wrathful impatience with conventional politics sketched in Earth in the Balance was silenced as the book became the first ever bestseller that a publisher refrained from pushing. Clinton liked the volume, but Carville, Harold Ickes and the realists on the party's Left, trying to win an election, found it insane at best, scary at worst. Gore the Rainbow Warrior duly became Gore the Vice-President. </p> <p>But what kind of packaging was it? The nadir of Gore's life-as-theatre came at the party convention in New York that year, Gore's 'coming-out' event. He told the delegates and viewing millions how he had watched Albert Gore III 'fly 30 feet through the air and scrape along the pavement... I ran to his side and held him and called his name... his eyes were open with the nothingness state of death'. Gore was reading every word off the autocue. </p> <p>The history of Vice-Presidents assuming the top office is a patchy one, as Pauline Gore must have realised when she expressed coded disapproval of her son's supporting role to the 'provincial' Bill Clinton. It was a concept in promotion pioneered by the shock of Truman's takeover from Franklin Roosevelt and L.B.J.'s even more dramatic succession of J.F. Kennedy, but these were without preparation. It worked differently in the more ambitious cases of Nixon, first of the 'modern' Vice-Presidents, and George Bush. </p> <p>A year ago, a lifetime of grooming 'Veep' Al Gore for the presidency seemed doomed to failure. A bumper sticker appeared: 'Stuck in Traffic? Blame Al Gore'. Gore had creased the nation's sides by telling CNN's Wolf Blitzer he had 'taken the initiative in creating the internet'. Hillary Clinton's candidacy in New York created a Medusan triangle inside the White House with resentments in all directions. Most importantly, Gore was making instantly and utterly forgettable speeches: 'Gore' was spelled with a 'B'. </p> <p>A Wagnerian family psychodrama was playing out between Clinton and Gore - 'father' and 'son' - which was, with hindsight, crucial to Gore's selection of running mate last week. Throughout the Lewinsky scandal, Gore had walked a high wire between loyalty and disgust. Apart from Hillary, he was the most senior victim of the President's deceit but also had the highest honour under Clinton's patronage to betray if he abandoned him. </p> <p>Gore's political father (Clinton) finally blessed Gore's ambition to become President in 1998, the year that his actual father died, thereby turning Clinton's political paternity into something more complex. Gore always knew that his success lay in the passing of power by both to him, as George Bush Snr has done to his son. But there was a problem - the motives of both Gore's father figures were entirely narcissistic. One wanted a President Gore who would bear the family name in the White House, the other a President Gore to rescue his legacy from the stains on Monica's dress. </p> <p>In his hour of need, Gore was shunned by the surrogate father in a way he never was by Albert Snr. Out of the blue, Clinton made an unsolicited call to the New York Times, making clear his displeasure at the way Gore was conducting his campaign. On the morning his remarks were published, the atmosphere in Gore's White House office was one of 'stunned disbelief'. Meanwhile, down the corridor, Gore had been shut out of the huddle that gathered around the President to discuss the advisability and fallout of the Times interview. Gore's retort came sharp enough. He told Diane Sawyer he thought Clinton's behaviour during the Lewinsky scandal had been 'inexcusable... especially as a father'. </p> <p>Gore assembled a team with specific instructions - to repackage him again, almost from scratch. One source told The Observer that Gore himself even admitted privately that 'I would not vote for the Al Gore I read about'. A war council was convened by the new campaign director, Tony Coelho, a former Congressman dogged by allegations of embezzlement and scandal, to do just that. With Coelho was Bob Shrum, former wordsmith for Teddy Kennedy who will have written Gore's sink-or-swim Los Angeles speech; Gore's daughter, Karenna Gore Schriff, and wife, Tipper; Eskew and stringent political director Donna Brazile, who acted as pastor and conscience to the otherwise devious bunch. </p> <p>According to one present at the meeting, the message was to 'free Gore from his office and from the White House' - to declare UDI from Bill and Hillary. Gore moved his campaign headquarters from Washington to his supposed 'roots' in Tennessee. The move was also a good way to cull a troubled, squabbling staff, to sort out the wheat prepared to sacrifice everything to follow him from the chaff who preferred to stay around their DC dinner tables. Brazile added a trial by salary, cutting everybody's by two-thirds. Gore and his senior staff remained in the comfort of Washington. </p> <p>Diane Sawyer conducted the first TV interview in Tennessee with Gore and Tipper on his late father's tobacco farm. Gore wore jeans and cowboy boots. Sawyer threw the first pitch, a fastball. Her grandmother, she said, who was in tobacco farming, wanted to ask: how many strains of tobacco are there in the US? Gore stared back blankly, a look of wounded hatred in his eyes. The second question was about the maintenance of fencing between two properties; Gore was equally clueless. </p> <p>Addressing the crowds at his launch rally in Tennessee, Gore pledged to 'take my own values of faith and family to the Presidency' and promised: 'If you entrust me with the Presidency, I will marshal its authority, its resources and its moral leadership to fight for America's family.' It was a brazen slap in Clinton's face. Gore's campaign hit the road with speeches luxuriating in the strong economy, but barely mentioning Clinton. He needed to share in the President's public successes (and stubborn popularity among Americans) while denouncing his private failings. </p> <p>Winter came, and the packaging team devised a new, folksy Al Gore who stopped talking about 'livability' and held town meetings and his audience to raise their hands until he had identified who had the most grandchildren. As the jester of American politician-watching, Professor Todd Gitlin at New York University, puts it: 'The difference between Bush and Gore now is that Bush is fake trying to be real, while Gore is real trying to be fake.' </p> <p>But even the 'fake' package had trouble selling himself. Gore was tainted by the Russian money-laundering scandal. A photo opportunity in a canoe backfired when it emerged that 170 million gallons of water had been released to stage it, during a drought. Bill Bradley was making headway he simply didn't deserve. Coelho's tyrannical style was driving the team to distraction to no effect; he was hardly the Carville figure the campaign so obviously needed. There was bitter internal strife between one-time partners Eskew and the (now late) Bob Squier, policy adviser. The two men had once run a consultancy together but their combined presence on the Gore campaign was, said old White House hand Dick Morris 'like asking the Albanians and Serbs to work together'. Then came a final split from Bill, a bit of the sex appeal and the final makeover. </p> <p>The Gores had decided that marital bliss was the key to the post-Monica era, but now they added a bit of libido to their version. On stage, Tipper would summon him with a wave of her hand, saying: 'He's so sexy', and he would respond: 'I love it when she beckons me with her finger like that.' The chic feminist Naomi Wolf was recruited to refurbish Gore's wardrobe and promote his sexual chem istry from what she labelled 'Beta to Alpha' grade. </p> <p>It seemed to work. Brazile's puritanism played counterpoint to this flippancy. Gore became almost a control freak over his campaign, designing his own logos and websites. The result appeared on television during the New Hampshire primary opposite Bill Bradley. To the nation's amazement, Gore suddenly looked hunky, like a football quarterback dressed as a small-time Mafiosi. He was confident yet relaxed. </p> <p>Gore has since applied the new style to new crusades, none more virulently than that against America's drugs and medicines industry. Gore lambasts the pharmaceutical companies for 'gouging the consumer unfairly' and claims credit for a recent industry retreat in agreeing to allow South Africa and other countries to manufacture cheaper generic drugs to counter the Aids pandemic. But even this genetic modification is flawed because, as ever with Gore, it is disingenuous. Gore's claim that he pushed for the generic production of Aids medicines in South Africa is especially unconvincing. Last December, The Observer revealed the web of consultancies and lobbying that connected Gore to the major drug producers suing the South African government for trying to produce generics. </p> <p>This campaign is the final act in Gore's lifelong White House drama. The first scene has already been successfully played out: the overdue shedding of Coelho and his replacement by William Daley, a rough-cut professional and one of America's fourth dynasty after the Kennedys, Bushes, Gores, that of the past and present mayors of Chicago, Richard Daley Snr and Jr. If anyone can save Gore, it is Daley, as Gore must have known when he called him shortly after midnight to offer him the job. A groggy Daley said he'd like to think about it over a cup of coffee. 'OK,' replied Gore, 'go get your coffee and I'll hold.' </p> <p>The second scene was concluded last week with Lieberman's appointment. But this only complicates the third scene, which opens in Los Angeles tomorrow - that which is supposed to star President Al Gore, but in which President Bill Clinton will inevitably play centre stage. That was always the problem in packaging Al Gore - fathers. </p> <p>If this was Wagner, the aged, flawed Wotan would be standing at the foot of the mountain, spear in hand. Young Siegfried would slice it in half and Wotan would say: 'Pass on, for I cannot stop you.' But Al Gore Snr never taught his son how to use the sword, and neither did Bill Clinton. In the end, it was they who did the packaging, and neither was prepared, in the final hour, to be outshone by Al Gore.</p>",

To the nation's amazement, Gore suddenly looked hunky, like a football quarterback dressed as a small-time Mafiosi. He was confident yet relaxed. Gore has since applied the new style to new crusades, none more virulently than that against America's drugs and medicines industry. Gore lambasts the pharmaceutical companies for 'gouging the consumer unfairly' and claims credit for a recent industry retreat in agreeing to allow South Africa and other countries to manufacture cheaper generic drugs to counter the Aids pandemic. But even this genetic modification is flawed because, as ever with Gore, it is disingenuous. Gore's claim that he pushed for the generic production of Aids medicines in South Africa is especially unconvincing. Last December, The Observer revealed the web of consultancies and lobbying that connected Gore to the major drug producers suing the South African government for trying to produce generics. This campaign is the final act in Gore's lifelong White House drama. The first scene has already been successfully played out: the overdue shedding of Coelho and his replacement by William Daley, a rough-cut professional and one of America's fourth dynasty after the Kennedys, Bushes, Gores, that of the past and present mayors of Chicago, Richard Daley Snr and Jr. If anyone can save Gore, it is Daley, as Gore must have known when he called him shortly after midnight to offer him the job. A groggy Daley said he'd like to think about it over a cup of coffee. 'OK,' replied Gore, 'go get your coffee and I'll hold.' The second scene was concluded last week with Lieberman's appointment. But this only complicates the third scene, which opens in Los Angeles tomorrow - that which is supposed to star President Al Gore, but in which President Bill Clinton will inevitably play centre stage. That was always the problem in packaging Al Gore - fathers. If this was Wagner, the aged, flawed Wotan would be standing at the foot of the mountain, spear in hand. Young Siegfried would slice it in half and Wotan would say: 'Pass on, for I cannot stop you.' But Al Gore Snr never taught his son how to use the sword, and neither did Bill Clinton. In the end, it was they who did the packaging, and neither was prepared, in the final hour, to be outshone by Al Gore.",

For Bolton, whose makeshift team dominated the first half, surely better awaits once manager Sam Allardyce is able to work with a settled squad. For Stan Ternent's Burnley, as commanding after the interval as their hosts were before it, survival appears achievable on this display, should they avoid injuries to a worryingly thin squad. Given those limitations, it was ironic that it was a Burnley substitute, winger Glen Little, who dramatically altered the course of a game that seemed to be comfortably heading towards a home victory. Pre-season injury robbed Little, the object of summer interest from Aston Villa and Bradford, of a starting place, yet his introduction could scarcely have had a bigger impact on the game. First, just two minutes into the half, he exchanged passes with Paul Cook and Phil Gray before lobbing the ball narrowly over, then Little saw his shot blocked by Mark Fish with Gray placing the rebound wide from six yards. Finally, in the 56th minute, Paul Weller's throw-in presented Little with the space down the right-hand side and the winger's perfect cross was met by the stooping Gray, who headed home in front of 5,550 delirious visiting supporters.

Indeed, the fall-out that followed Bolton's play-off exit at Ipswich in May has led to a summer of traumatic transfer activity. Only three players on duty at Portman Road that night were available yesterday and, by the game's end, six of Bolton's 11 were debutants. So hectic has Allardyce's summer been that late on Friday he was still desperately adding bodies to his depleted squad in the form of the loan signing of Bradford striker Isiah Rankin, handed his debut against Burnley, and the arrival of free agent Ian Marshall, the former Leicester forward, on a short-term contract. How rewarding it must have been for Allardyce that the former was responsible for the first-half penalty that led to Bolton's goal and the latter almost won the game in the dying minutes. Rankin, whose career opportunities at Bradford must be at an end following the arrival of Benito Carbone and Ashley Ward, was direct and enthusiastic and won a 26th-minute penalty after Ian Cox was harshly judged to have brought him down as the debutant took advantage of excellent passes from Bo Hansen. Rankin recovered and had the ball in the goal, but only after the penalty had been awarded - one which the impressive Per Frandsen then expertly converted into the bottom right corner. 'I thought he had given us a free-kick,' said a bemused Ternent of referee Bill Burns's decision. 'The guy pulled our defender back, they scored, but he didn't give the goal. I couldn't work it out.

Not such an impossible timescale after all, then. ***** Not a single run came from the bat when Cuddalore were dismissed for six - all wides - by Chennai B in an inter-district women's match in India. But the oddest thing about this story of 10 consecutive ducks, told on the cricinfo.com website, is that one of the batswomen did get the ball away in the direction of the boundary, only to be seized by cramp as she started to run. A runner was called for, but when she arrived there was, alas, nothing more to run for.",

And he who took it upon himself, with the bat, to try to rectify the consequences of that decision. </p> <p>He didn't succeed. On 61, the captain of Hampshire was beaten and bowled by his namesake, Neil, the captain of Warwickshire. Great was the fielding side's rejoicing. Greatly expressive, too, was the weary pause before the batsman started his homeward trudge. </p> <p>Much earlier in the day the two Smiths had met for the toss, and there was considerable surprise at the decision to let Warwickshire bat first. That was evidently made on the basis of a touch of moisture in the pitch, perhaps promising a little movement in the morning. </p> <p>But it still looked like a desperate gamble by the poorest-performing side of the season, and quite soon it hardly looked like a contest at all as the ball went through slowly and without deviation - except from the bat. </p> <p>At other levels of cricket you will get sides turning up in August who are so weak - with players on holiday and a couple of fill-ins who may turn up late - that they opt to put the other team in to bat if they win the toss, to make the game last a bit longer. In truth it looked a bit like that, as Hampshire's decision to bowl at first looked increasingly nonsensical, and a huge Warwickshire total inevitable. </p> <p>Once Knight had got the pace of the pitch, he was soon finding an easy route to the backward-point boundary. Soon, too, he was going down the pitch to seam bowlers - forcing the keeper to come up to the stumps to try and deter him. </p> <p>Anurag Singh took a little longer to get moving. And, on 10, he survived when bowler and wicketkeeper believed the ball had flicked Singh's outside edge as he played forward. Channel 4's snickometer gave some credence to that, but umpire Jeremy Lloyds wasn't convinced. </p> <p>In the absence of Shane Warne, Hampshire's only bowling ace was Alan Mullally, who has been in great championship form. But when he came on first change he was immediately expensive - Singh striking a wonderful extra-cover boundary 'on the up' - and was withdrawn after two overs. It wasn't that he was bowling badly, more that the pitch offered no pace or movement. </p> <p>So easy was it that it is hard to say whether Knight's performance will force his Test claims. It must also have been hard for Warwickshire to determine how well they were doing. Ironically, the sublime progress of Knight and Singh left little time for the real enforcers. No blame to the openers, though. The pair's 185 was a first-wicket record for Warwickshire in any one-day competition, beating the 180 of those 1970s favourites Dennis Amiss and John Jameson. </p> <p>Given a platform of 133 without loss from 30 overs, 262 was perhaps a touch light. Perhaps Hampshire had done rather well after all? That nagging thought deepened as the captain came in first, and gave the innings a flying start. His highest score in any cricket this season is just 71, but now we saw the Smith of old: the bristling body language, the defiant forward defensive alternating with the rifle-shot square cut. </p> <p>But spin was always his weak point, and he was 'done' by both the flight and turn of the ball which went through his half-formed drive. It was 101 for two when he fell.

But he might have to bat at number seven, which might make him grumpy again. This ploy could only be justified if the selectors were convinced that the Headingley pitch was going to be at its most nefarious with innings lasting no more than about 70 overs. Otherwise England might run out of bowlers. </p> <p>Perhaps the likeliest option will be to replace Croft with another paceman and let Vaughan do whatever spinning is necessary. In which case Matthew Hoggard would expect to be recalled on his home ground. He may be deserving but it must also be tempting for the selectors to whisk Alan Mullally back into the team. Being left-handed he offers variety. More importantly he is in the best form of his life.

It was 8am and the sun was beating down on my sweating head. I wondered what kind of week I had let myself in for. </p> <p>Our group of 24 strangers had arrived in Egypt three days earlier with Explore Worldwide and was travelling down the Nile in feluccas , traditional Egyptian sailing boats. Our aim was to take part in a subsidised operation to clear rubbish left on the riverbanks by other tourists. The lure was a holiday for just \u00a3250 and feeling good about undoing the environmental damage caused by others. </p> <p>From the 17-year-old student to the retired maths teacher, we were a diverse group. On the first day our guide, Suzy, led us on a vigorous early-morning donkey trek from Luxor, across the honey-coloured cliffs to the Valley of the Kings. An equally lively descent brought us to the Mortuary Temple of Queen Hatshepsut, the third queen to rule ancient Egypt and the first to reign as a 'pharaoh'. It was here in November 1997 that six armed Muslim fundamentalists had killed 58 holidaymakers, including six Britons. The only destruction we saw was that wreaked by Hatshepsut's successor, Tuthmosis III, whose hatred of the woman drove him to obliterate her image and replace it with his own. </p> <p>Next we boarded a train to the southern city of Aswan, in Nubia. A hot evening Sahara wind and a team of taxis took us past the Aswan dam to a vivid, blue-painted Nubian village at the side of the Nile, where our host for the night welcomed us into his home. We listened entranced to his description of his family's frugal life. There was a distant ringing, louder by the second. Slowly, he reached into the pocket of his gallabiyah and pulled out his mobile phone. </p> <p>Having slept on the sand outside the house, under a star-littered sky, I was woken at dawn by the gentle sounds of the Nile tickling its banks and the less gentle sound of some of my snoring companions. </p> <p>Forty minutes later we were on rock-hard saddles, trekking across the desert on camels to St Simeon's monastery, a sixth-century Christian stronghold. It was several hours before I lost my John Wayne walk. Comfort for the saddle-sore came with retail therapy at Aswan bazaar, bursting with colour and noise, where traders tested their Del Boy hard-sell with cries of 'luvly jubbly' and 'have a gander'. </p> <p>So, to our outdoor home for the next four days: three beautiful, cotton-sailed feluccas on our clean-up route from Aswan to Edfu. Early each morning we cleaned in three teams for several hours - and again at the end of each day on another stretch of the river where we would moor for the night. We bagged our rubbish for recycling or built bonfires. Sweating over piles of rubbish, we bonded quickly, our squeamishness forgotten in the haste to avoid the heat. </p> <p>The days were spent drifting downriver past rushes, banana palms and trees of bursting ripe mangoes on one side and sun-cracked earth on the other. We passed Nubian farmers loading their day's work on to faded blue and green rowing boats. We lay on deck, talked, snoozed, swam, watched the river and felt its current. The captain had mastered the art of delegation, leaving the sweaty work to his young lieutenant, while he spent his days lazily eyeing up the women, offering his services - 'youwannamassage?' - and Arabic lessons. For reasons that soon became apparent he was called Gin. </p> <p>Our slumber was occasionally broken. On our third day on the river, suddenly there stood the well preserved temple of Kom Ombo, on the Nile's east bank, a garden of sunflowers and heady jasmine at its base. It is dedicated to Horus, the sky god, and Sobek, the crocodile god. </p> <p>At sunset, a party would take its turn to dig our lava tory for the night, and hammer in its surrounding canopy at a discreet distance from our boats. We ate simple meals and retired to the beach, beer in hand, to dance, talk or play raucous Jameson-fuelled games by the fire to the hypnotic sounds of our crew's drums and their vibrant song. It became hard to imagine another life. We slept on deck, waking with first light for a communal wash in the Nile. </p> <p>On our final felucca day, we reached Edfu, where accumulated rubbish which had been stored on a separate boat was transferred to the incinerator for disposal. Dusty, we mingled with much cleaner tourists at the temple of Horus, built in honour of the falcon-headed god. </p> <p>Climbing into taxis, we sped back to Luxor, where our senses were assaulted by the dry heat, car horns so loud I felt my head about to burst, traffic, men yelling ' baksheesh ', and wild Egyptian music coming from every roadside village. </p> <p>It was almost over.

It is dusk on 14 August and preparations for the eve of the Assumption are under way. </p> <p>Festivals on Skino\u00fassa - one of the tiniest inhabited islands in the Greek archipelago - don't come much bigger than the summer Panagyri . Its full name is the Apok\u00edmisis tis Panagyias , or Final Repose of the Blessed Mary. As prodigal offspring jet in from the far reaches of the Greek diaspora to celebrate the Virgin's assumption into heaven, the island embraces its extended family. These xenitem\u00e9ni (self-imposed exiles) are the legacy of sustained economic migrancy, and the sight of barnacled old men greeting their smooth-skinned brothers from abroad is peculiarly touching. For two weeks, this rock in the Aegean is transformed into a cosmopolitan microculture where 10-year-olds insist they like Skino\u00fassa because the crime rate is much lower than in Johannesburg. </p> <p>The name derives from the violent thorns ( sk\u00edna ) specific to its rough terrain, all four square miles of it. Part of a cluster of Minor Cyclades also known as the 'Islands of Solitude', it buffers the waves between N\u00e1xos to the west and Orthodox Amorg\u00f3s to the east. Here, the feudal and the modern nuzzle together. Windmills and satellite dishes and pylons score the horizon. </p> <p>What unites the crowds gathered for the Panagyri celebrations is a tenacious nostalgia for the nest they have flown. 'Don't you dig the lifestyle? Like these guys really know how to enjoy themselves,' says Christina, from Astoria, New York. 'Back in the States we just work and then some!' </p> <p>If the myth of Persephone is alive and kicking, the price of paradise has gone up in modern times. Instead of six months away from the 'underworld', you get two weeks of annual freedom and stockpile the rest for retirement. Perhaps those who stayed put view it all differently. Like M\u00edtsos, the ancient fisherman deafened in an encounter with a windmill blade; and B\u00e1rba Io\u00e1nnis, near-blind with cataracts, his Assos cigarette invariably missing the three ashtrays on his table. The tragedy of lost communication can be excruciating to behold when the deaf man forgets to remember to watch the lips of the blind man. </p> <p>Paradise or not, Skino\u00fassa is a strikingly beautiful island. It is also surprisingly lush. And, like a floating Noah's Ark, it bursts at the seams with outsized livestock. Away from the toil of subsistence farming, the island boasts 17 unspoilt and chiefly hidden beaches. Desert island life is both pleasurable and disarming : it was curious to return from an isolated beach to find my outgoing footprints still immaculate in the dirt-track. Perhaps the flip-side to this Crusoe-esque stuff is the islanders' fascination for the verb taxidevo - travel. Used for transport of all sorts, it refers more specifically to figurative modes of escape. Drink, music, love and nature are all 'taxis' ferrying passengers to otherworldly destinations. </p> <p>Which is, of course, the spirit of the Panagyri . Miraculously, Skino\u00fassans reinvent life on their tiny slab of existence, resorting to their exhilarating talent for music and dance and letting rip. Forget plate-smashing and think a different breed of bacchanalian abandon: whole crates of Amstel beer and ersatz champagne hurled to the ground with the sort of gusto that offers enough of a fleeting escape to be a holiday in itself. I wonder if this exuberant 'journeying' reflects the knowledge that the Virgin Mary is not the only one bound for the skies, for the Panagyri also marks summer's close. </p> <p>Shutters are snapped into place and the acrid camphor of mothballs mingles incongruously with the scent of wild thyme. Down at the port of Mers\u00edni, there are painful leave-takings as the Skopel\u00edtis - the provisions boat from N\u00e1xos - manoeuvres its way out of the natural harbour into the world beyond. The night is young, however, and I am getting ahead of myself. Kyrios Angelos would not approve. </p> <p> The old man looks up from his Bible and focuses on the spectacle of sated tourists at his niece's kafen\u00edo . Worked off her feet, Kyria Pothit\u00ed shrills and spins in the kitchen like a whirling dervish. Out on the terrace, her university-educated son enjoys the attention he's getting as a temporary waiter. Expertly, he knits his eyebrows together and flurries into irresistibly accented English. Named after his great uncle, he briefs natives and ox\u00e9ni (outsiders) about the Bar Piraktik\u00f3 where his brothers are preparing the way for us to party long beyond dawn. Getting there involves a trek across recently ploughed fields, but there are lifts to be caught and the views of Almir\u00f3s beach just below and K\u00e9ros over on the horizon will make it worth our while. Everyone is welcome at the festivities. </p> <p>Apart from two Parisian fashion designers, there are Italians and a sprinkling of Scandinavians, but no Germans and few English. An international currency of words and smoke wafts over from the crowd next door, at Melt\u00e9mi's fresh grill. </p> <p>Along the main thoroughfare, the ambience is hotting up on the balcony of Bar Margar\u00edta and stomachs are swelling at Panor\u00e1ma, a summer joint run by the primary school teacher and ex-president of the island. </p> <p>The church's blue dome is set in the heart of the island. Its circular stained glass windows are shot through with lingering shafts of sunlight and the courtyard is a riot of abstract Cycladic lines. Inside, there are rich frescoes and an unusual icon depicting the Virgin standing rather than seated. Tapers are lit and incense fills the air. The chanting of those freed from tourist duties provides a contrast to the light, skipping rhythms of Cycladic island music. </p> <p>The priest has made a special trip over from the (literally) cliff-hanging monastery on Amorg\u00f3s. He is part of Skino\u00fassa's history, in as far as today's inhabitants - all six clans of them - are descendants of the last wave of settlers sent over by the monastery in 1840. </p> <p>I meet a sound-recordist from an award-winning film documentary about Skino\u00fassa. He is back on the island for the first time in around 20 years and trying to absorb the changes in a place candied in his mind. He assures me that his experience was the real thing. </p> <p>He spins me tales of paraffin lamps and water drawn from the well down at Mers\u00edni, of grown men dancing with handkerchiefs and children learning to write with their fingers in the dust. He enthuses about musicians playing at dawn to wake the sleeping fishermen cradled in their boats and about a people who had never been to Athens or experienced the razor-blade of tourism. </p> <p>His chin grows long with regret and we head to the Piraktik\u00f3 to lift our spirits. It is a good move. Everyone is down on their knees, clapping and yelping encouragement to the solo-dancer in their midst. He is Man\u00f3lis, Angelos's younger brother, and he kicks his legs and shrieks and spins before brushing the ground skilfully and rebounding. He combines lightning dexterity with hovering poise and he punctuates his rhythms with such intricate counterpoint that even the sound-recordist approves. </p> <p>The onlookers keep offering him toasts or prop\u00f3sis , and Man\u00f3lis downs a throatful from each glass before flinging it away and continuing the dance. </p> <p>Ad\u00f3nis, cousin of Angelos and Man\u00f3lis, is supposedly keeping the tab at the bar, but the drink is flowing so freely and so generously that I cannot see the point. We have danced all night to the starlight and now the sun is rising, red and mystical, behind K\u00e9ros. </p> <p>We are expected for church at 10. We plunge into the early morning waters of Alm\u00edros, before heading up to the village and the day's festivities. We pass the farmers on their way to milk the goats and we hear the sound of firecrackers resonating from every corner of the island. </p> <p>Pothit\u00ed's terrace fills for the game of b\u00edlies , a version of skittles that uses nine wooden bricks. The aim is to topple the centre brick, worth 10 points, or else score a point for each brick hit. There are two teams and it takes until evening for one of them to reach a winning score. </p> <p>Then the sound-recordist entreats us, xenitem\u00e9ni , ox\u00e9ni and Skinoussans alike, to a viewing of his film. I am torn between watching it and glancing at the faces of the islanders watching themselves 20 years ago. Unfortunately, the priest's video player goes up in a puff of smoke halfway through our session. But I've seen enough to know that Kyrios Angelos looks as sharp now as he did then.

      "byline": "Joanna Walters",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> Seeing a killer whale close up in its natural surroundings is a heart-stopping moment. Of awe, not fear. It doesn't have to do anything spectacular such as leap in the air or hunt in a pack, with David Attenborough narrating. </p> <p>Simply watching this gargantuan and graceful beast glide slowly through a piercing-blue stretch of ocean is utterly thrilling. Around 100 killer whales spend all their springs and summers pursuing the wild king salmon and chilling out between meals just yards off the San Juan archipelago of tiny, lush islands not far from Seattle, at the northern end of the US Pacific coast. </p> <p>The Free Willy movies were filmed around here and the area is a real draw for nature lovers and sailors, especially those who want to watch whales. Tourists take to boats and canoes to observe the resident orca - to give killer whales their polite Latin name - or just sit on the shore with a picnic, as the whales often swim close by. </p> <p>When a group of eight of us in an open-backed cruiser chanced on a group of three killer whales it was an emotional moment. Our skipper had been about to give up and turn back to the harbour because a bone-chilling and seemingly impenetrable late-spring mist was gathering. </p> <p>But as suddenly as it had descended, the fog evaporated, just as a giant male orca bobbed its head up out of the water some distance away, looking around in what whale watchers call a 'spy hop'. Moments later two towering dorsal fins cut through the water next to the boat and a calf followed behind, breaking the surface with its body and flashing its characteristic white patches. </p> <p>The orca family was in no hurry, content to swish and dive in the millpond sea. The snow-capped Olympic Mountains formed the backdrop to the glassy ocean on one side, a hazy view of Vancouver Island, just across the Canadian border, on the other. </p> <p>It is not hard to see why the San Juan islands have become the holiday playground for burnt-out Boeing bosses and millionaire Microsoft net-heads who work for Seattle's two biggest employers. These and other urban stressballs consume the tranquillity and natural feast from their timber lodges, discreet guesthouses and yachts. There are no traffic lights, nightclubs or high-rise blocks. But there is fresh seafood, ancient woodland, crystal waters and the chance to commune with the sealions, whales, bald eagles and cormorants. </p> <p> Even getting to San Juan Island, the largest in the archipelago, is special. Trippers take off in seven-seater De Havilland Beaver seaplanes from the middle of Lake Union amid the skyscrapers of downtown Seattle. After an hour's low-level flying over Puget Sound with spectacular views of the snowy Mount Rainier volcano, the plane skims into San Juan Island's diminutive Friday Harbour. There are also ferries from the mainland. Either way it feels like arriving in paradise. </p> <p>But wonderful as it looks, there is trouble in paradise.The killer whales are under threat. An adult orca needs almost 50 kilos of salmon a day. But Bill Wright, who owns San Juan Safaris, which runs boat and canoe trips to see the whales, estimates that the region's salmon population has declined by 90 per cent in the past 100 years, with its annihilation greatly accelerated during the 'greed is good' Eighties. </p> <p>He partly blames aggressive logging in nearby Washington and Oregon states and the transformation of near-desert landscape inland into lush ranches with golf courses using thousands of gallons of water for irrigation and artificial fertilisers. These actions decimated the topsoil and filled the rivers pouring into the whales' Pacific feeding waters with silt and pesticides he said. </p> <p>In addition hydro-electric programmes have dammed many of the rivers, providing inadequate salmon 'ladders' alongside and therefore making it virtually impossible for the fish to swim upriver to their breeding grounds. Combine all that with straightforward over-fishing and it won't be long before the islanders start to lose their orcas. </p> <p>Wright is very conscious that what looks like perfection is already an illusion and that the fragile ecosystem will break down without greater protection. He said: 'Some of the worst damage was inflicted at the height of Republican economic aggression, and there was only thought for money in these parts, no thought for tomorrow and no thought for our environment.' </p> <p>The local island newspaper is full of stories of the whale population shrinking and familiar individual orcas failing to return from their winter feeding grounds. The scarcer minke and grey whales are also reportedly being spotted less frequently. </p> <p>Whale watching itself has come in for criticism. Wright is an example of a local businessman who is also an environmentalist. He makes a living taking tourists out on his cruisers and believes the orca don't mind the dozens of tourist boats from different companies that criss-cross their habitat during the summer. Boats are not allowed to drive within 100 metres of a whale and must switch their engines off in the vicinity. </p> <p> Wright said: 'I was there yesterday and some dolphins surrounded the boat for 15 minutes, leaping and diving around the hull. They were curious and obviously loving it.' </p> <p>He said that, since the hunting parties that used to come out from the Seattle area to shoot whales were banned in the Seventies, the whales were in better shape than they had been for 30 years. As well as being a leading figure in the San Juan whale watching industry, Wright is also involved in environmental and conservation movements seeking better ways to protect the orca. </p> <p>But some locals disagree that commercial whale-watching is beneficial. One boat captain said it was not uncommon to see 100 boats out in the single stretch of ocean just off San Juan Island watching the whales at the height of the season - in August. </p> <p>He said: 'When things get really busy out there I think the whales do get upset. I see mothers with calves slapping the water with their fins repeatedly. I always interpret it as the equivalent of them shaking their fist, saying \"get out of here\" to the humans,' he said. </p> <p>Others spoke of the rules governing whale watching as being too lax and poorly enforced in the area. 'There are boats coming from Vancouver Island, mainland Canada and the San Juan Islands, so there isn't one system. People try to be considerate, but it gets pretty chaotic out there at the height of the season,' said one. </p> <p>A greener alternative to the cruiser boats are the paddling trips in kayaks. As well as the chance to see whales close up in absolute silence, there is the exhilaration of paddling past the wooded island peninsulas and rocky outcrops with their resident eagles and seals. And giant starfish and anemones are visible on the seabed in the shallows. Kayaking, however, will never be the money-spinner that whale-watching boat trips are. </p> <p>The other local debate is the one about the whales and the area's Native American communities, or what this all-white enclave mostly refers to as 'Indian tribes'. Native Americans hunted and fished these waters as long as 10,000 years ago, but have long since been driven out and corralled on mainland 'reservations'. </p> <p>Lee Brooks, who runs a small Native American art and sculpture gallery at Friday Harbour, said he has listened to torrents of poisonous ranting from both islanders and visitors about the very existence of the people who produce the crafts on display. </p> <p>Some islanders blame the Native American populations in Washington State for over-exploiting their ancient fishing rights. One group has caused a storm by winning the right to kill five minke whales a year, which has prompted a local environmental protest ship to blockade their boats during the hunting season. </p> <p>Brooks said: 'The environmentalists did not want to discuss or negotiate with the Native American fishermen - there was no dialogue, just leafleting and placards.' </p> <p>He is dubious about the merits of the tourism industry that makes a fortune off the orca's graceful backs and on which the island now depends. He believes the whale-watching industry has been allowed to grow too far. </p> <p>He looked out of the gallery window disconsolately as another seaplane arrived from Seattle and a Canadian ferry docked, disgorging more pleasure seekers eager to indulge in nature's bounty. </p> <p>'The orcas are dying and time's running out to save them,' he said bitterly.</p> <p><strong>Fact file </strong></p> <p><strong>Flights</strong></p> <p>Joanna Walters travelled to Seattle with British Airways (0845 77 333 77) from Heathrow. Return fares in the whale-watch season range from \u00a3329 Apex/ \u00a3737 fully flexible economy in May, to \u00a3570 Apex/\u00a32,180 fully flexible economy from July-Sept.

      "bodyText": "Seeing a killer whale close up in its natural surroundings is a heart-stopping moment. Of awe, not fear. It doesn't have to do anything spectacular such as leap in the air or hunt in a pack, with David Attenborough narrating. Simply watching this gargantuan and graceful beast glide slowly through a piercing-blue stretch of ocean is utterly thrilling. Around 100 killer whales spend all their springs and summers pursuing the wild king salmon and chilling out between meals just yards off the San Juan archipelago of tiny, lush islands not far from Seattle, at the northern end of the US Pacific coast. The Free Willy movies were filmed around here and the area is a real draw for nature lovers and sailors, especially those who want to watch whales. Tourists take to boats and canoes to observe the resident orca - to give killer whales their polite Latin name - or just sit on the shore with a picnic, as the whales often swim close by. When a group of eight of us in an open-backed cruiser chanced on a group of three killer whales it was an emotional moment. Our skipper had been about to give up and turn back to the harbour because a bone-chilling and seemingly impenetrable late-spring mist was gathering. But as suddenly as it had descended, the fog evaporated, just as a giant male orca bobbed its head up out of the water some distance away, looking around in what whale watchers call a 'spy hop'. Moments later two towering dorsal fins cut through the water next to the boat and a calf followed behind, breaking the surface with its body and flashing its characteristic white patches. The orca family was in no hurry, content to swish and dive in the millpond sea. The snow-capped Olympic Mountains formed the backdrop to the glassy ocean on one side, a hazy view of Vancouver Island, just across the Canadian border, on the other. It is not hard to see why the San Juan islands have become the holiday playground for burnt-out Boeing bosses and millionaire Microsoft net-heads who work for Seattle's two biggest employers. These and other urban stressballs consume the tranquillity and natural feast from their timber lodges, discreet guesthouses and yachts. There are no traffic lights, nightclubs or high-rise blocks. But there is fresh seafood, ancient woodland, crystal waters and the chance to commune with the sealions, whales, bald eagles and cormorants. Even getting to San Juan Island, the largest in the archipelago, is special. Trippers take off in seven-seater De Havilland Beaver seaplanes from the middle of Lake Union amid the skyscrapers of downtown Seattle. After an hour's low-level flying over Puget Sound with spectacular views of the snowy Mount Rainier volcano, the plane skims into San Juan Island's diminutive Friday Harbour. There are also ferries from the mainland. Either way it feels like arriving in paradise. But wonderful as it looks, there is trouble in paradise.The killer whales are under threat. An adult orca needs almost 50 kilos of salmon a day. But Bill Wright, who owns San Juan Safaris, which runs boat and canoe trips to see the whales, estimates that the region's salmon population has declined by 90 per cent in the past 100 years, with its annihilation greatly accelerated during the 'greed is good' Eighties. He partly blames aggressive logging in nearby Washington and Oregon states and the transformation of near-desert landscape inland into lush ranches with golf courses using thousands of gallons of water for irrigation and artificial fertilisers. These actions decimated the topsoil and filled the rivers pouring into the whales' Pacific feeding waters with silt and pesticides he said. In addition hydro-electric programmes have dammed many of the rivers, providing inadequate salmon 'ladders' alongside and therefore making it virtually impossible for the fish to swim upriver to their breeding grounds. Combine all that with straightforward over-fishing and it won't be long before the islanders start to lose their orcas. Wright is very conscious that what looks like perfection is already an illusion and that the fragile ecosystem will break down without greater protection. He said: 'Some of the worst damage was inflicted at the height of Republican economic aggression, and there was only thought for money in these parts, no thought for tomorrow and no thought for our environment.' The local island newspaper is full of stories of the whale population shrinking and familiar individual orcas failing to return from their winter feeding grounds. The scarcer minke and grey whales are also reportedly being spotted less frequently. Whale watching itself has come in for criticism. Wright is an example of a local businessman who is also an environmentalist. He makes a living taking tourists out on his cruisers and believes the orca don't mind the dozens of tourist boats from different companies that criss-cross their habitat during the summer. Boats are not allowed to drive within 100 metres of a whale and must switch their engines off in the vicinity. Wright said: 'I was there yesterday and some dolphins surrounded the boat for 15 minutes, leaping and diving around the hull. They were curious and obviously loving it.' He said that, since the hunting parties that used to come out from the Seattle area to shoot whales were banned in the Seventies, the whales were in better shape than they had been for 30 years. As well as being a leading figure in the San Juan whale watching industry, Wright is also involved in environmental and conservation movements seeking better ways to protect the orca. But some locals disagree that commercial whale-watching is beneficial. One boat captain said it was not uncommon to see 100 boats out in the single stretch of ocean just off San Juan Island watching the whales at the height of the season - in August. He said: 'When things get really busy out there I think the whales do get upset. I see mothers with calves slapping the water with their fins repeatedly. I always interpret it as the equivalent of them shaking their fist, saying \"get out of here\" to the humans,' he said. Others spoke of the rules governing whale watching as being too lax and poorly enforced in the area. 'There are boats coming from Vancouver Island, mainland Canada and the San Juan Islands, so there isn't one system. People try to be considerate, but it gets pretty chaotic out there at the height of the season,' said one. A greener alternative to the cruiser boats are the paddling trips in kayaks. As well as the chance to see whales close up in absolute silence, there is the exhilaration of paddling past the wooded island peninsulas and rocky outcrops with their resident eagles and seals. And giant starfish and anemones are visible on the seabed in the shallows. Kayaking, however, will never be the money-spinner that whale-watching boat trips are. The other local debate is the one about the whales and the area's Native American communities, or what this all-white enclave mostly refers to as 'Indian tribes'. Native Americans hunted and fished these waters as long as 10,000 years ago, but have long since been driven out and corralled on mainland 'reservations'. Lee Brooks, who runs a small Native American art and sculpture gallery at Friday Harbour, said he has listened to torrents of poisonous ranting from both islanders and visitors about the very existence of the people who produce the crafts on display. Some islanders blame the Native American populations in Washington State for over-exploiting their ancient fishing rights. One group has caused a storm by winning the right to kill five minke whales a year, which has prompted a local environmental protest ship to blockade their boats during the hunting season. Brooks said: 'The environmentalists did not want to discuss or negotiate with the Native American fishermen - there was no dialogue, just leafleting and placards.' He is dubious about the merits of the tourism industry that makes a fortune off the orca's graceful backs and on which the island now depends. He believes the whale-watching industry has been allowed to grow too far. He looked out of the gallery window disconsolately as another seaplane arrived from Seattle and a Canadian ferry docked, disgorging more pleasure seekers eager to indulge in nature's bounty. 'The orcas are dying and time's running out to save them,' he said bitterly. Fact file Flights Joanna Walters travelled to Seattle with British Airways (0845 77 333 77) from Heathrow. Return fares in the whale-watch season range from \u00a3329 Apex/ \u00a3737 fully flexible economy in May, to \u00a3570 Apex/\u00a32,180 fully flexible economy from July-Sept.

If you've ever visited the giants of northern California, the sequoias and redwoods, you will understand the true scale of this devastation - and the huge irony of it. </p> <p>It was last September when I went to the Giant Sequoia Grove on the outskirts of Yosemite National Park. The leaves were turning russet and gold against the backdrop of summer's green. I was expecting to be amazed by them, and had got used to the idea of size by the presence of foot-long sugar-pine cones littering the forest floor. But nothing prepares you for the trees themselves. </p> <p>Giant Sequoias grow up to 300ft tall, the first one we saw was 87ft in circumference and its weight estimated at 6,100 tonnes. Giant sequoias are the largest single living organisms on the planet and can live for up to 3,000 years. How do you even start putting that figure into any kind of appreciable context? It precedes the Battle of Hastings by 2,000 years, it's 1,000 years older than Christianity. What does all the fuss over the millennium mean to a sequoia that has lived through three of them? </p> <p>The Giant Sequoia Grove was very quiet and cool. I pressed my body against the soft, reddish bark and stretched my arms out as far as I could. I was completely flat. It was like pressing up against a spongy wall, the top of which was invisible above me. </p> <p>One sequoia yields the same amount of timber as one acre of pine. About 100 years ago early timber manufacturers realised they could make a fortune from a single tree and set about cutting down as many as possible. Now they are protected and their natural habitats are national parks. </p> <p>And as biologists and botanists understand more about these ancient and majestic giants, they have also started to believe that the thing that is threatening to destroy so much of America's forests may also be one of the things that ensures the sequoia's survival. For now some experts think that fire is part of the trees' regenerative cycle; that, far from damaging forest growth, it is a necessary part of it. </p> <p>Every year giant sequoias drop up to 1,500 pine cones on to the forest floor. Each cone contains as many as 200 seeds. When the forest floor burns it heats the cones which releases the seeds. The fire also burns all the debris from the forest floor, known as duff, exposing mineral-rich soil for the seeds to take root in. In addition smaller, weaker trees are destroyed by the fire, leaving more space for the stronger trees to succeed. </p> <p>Over time, lightning has struck in the Giant Sequoia Grove and started fires which have cleared away the duff. In the grove we visited there are just a handful of trees as their growth is also restricted by elevation and warmth. The fact that so few sequoias succeed shows what a hit-and-miss system of survival this is. Yet survive they have done. </p> <p>As we sat in the grove, it felt like all the wisdom in the world was contained within these trees, that here was the very soul of the planet; that this is what it's all about: trees that live and grow and spread and creak and then finally die and fall, crushing huge swaths of forest beneath them, decaying for centuries but nourishing generations of life. </p> <p>We may think we run this planet, but I very much hope the giant sequoias will be here long after we're gone.</p>",

The book is Vladimir Nabokov's The Luzhin Defence, now - it almost certainly says - a major film starring John Turturro and Emily Watson. </p> <p>Watson is on the cover, although you couldn't really tell: she's got her head turned away from the camera, towards Turturro. Both are soaked. 'Why did they choose this picture?' she's asking. 'That scene isn't even in the film. We got halfway through shooting it when the rain pump broke down, so it was all a disaster. We managed to realign the story so we didn't need it.' </p> <p>Meeting Watson is strange. Beforehand, everyone says she's very nice, and so she is. In most ways she seems like a very average 33-year-old Londoner, if one on the more grown-up end of the spectrum. In person, she's more elegant than you expect: tall and wearing a dark green top and pale green trousers that accentuate her height. </p> <p>But Watson isn't an average Camden Town resident, still less your average actress. She received best actress Oscar nominations for her first film, Breaking The Waves and also for Hilary And Jackie. And even that doesn't do her justice: Breaking The Waves was hardly Academy-fodder, being foreign, strange, brutal and sexual. The force of Watson's performance meant that the Academy was forced to pay attention. </p> <p>Her impact has been so powerful so fast that it is a surprise when you realise how few films she's done. She counts them on her fingers, suggests six before deciding on seven. In fact, it's eight. In her third film, she starred opposite Daniel Day-Lewis in Jim Sheridan's The Boxer. The fourth was the controversial Hilary And Jackie. And her fifth was Tim Robbins's Cradle Will Rock, followed by Angela's Ashes. All in four years. </p> <p>It's an unlikely tale. After an impeccably middle-class upbringing (father an architect, mother a teacher) in London, Watson went to Bristol University to do English. She wanted to act, but had trouble convincing people she could. Drama schools turned her down. Eventually The Drama Studio in west London took her and she graduated to the Royal Shakespeare Company. By the time she started acting professionally, she was already 25. </p> <p>One of the words she uses most is 'lucky' and you can see why. She was still unknown at 29 when Lars von Trier chose her to play the disturbed girl from the tiny Calvinist Scottish island who marries a foreign oil rig worker. Then again, at the time only film buffs knew who von Trier was. Breaking The Waves would change both their lives. 'It was just a very personal thing for me,' she says in her soft voice. 'I'd never made a film before. I didn't know it was an important film. But I think I was aware that it represented a very intense time of personal change for him [von Trier]. Because if you look at the change between Europa and Breaking The Waves, he's thrown the rule book out of the window, and his relationship with actors completely changed, from bodies that you put somewhere to really being in touch with his emotional state. And he was discovering that in Breaking The Waves, so it was special.' Most actresses aren't able to analyse the different stages of directors' careers. Watson is different. </p> <p>There is a chance that Breaking The Waves will turn out to be one of the key films in cinema history. Already its influence has been enormous. And the reactions to it have been repeated with von Trier's Dancer In The Dark. Watson is a fan, although she expresses it in a slightly disturbing way. 'For me, watching it was like having someone walk over my grave. I could tell what was going to happen. Little things. I loved it, I found it very raw.' </p> <p>In a way, it is easy to see why the drama schools passed on Watson. The reason she is so effective on screen is that she acts with her face. Sure, she is no slouch at accents, but the expression comes from the corners of her mouth, her vast eyes. She is mildly taken aback when I suggest that this might be why her film career blossomed in a way her stage career did not. But she considers the point. 'It's funny, you don't know that about your face until someone points a camera at it. The first time I saw Breaking The Waves was in Cannes, and each nostril was as big as a house. It was a real shocker: I wasn't wearing any make-up - and no clothes at times - and everything was very exposed. It's a weird thing.' </p> <p>'Exposed' is something she's willing to do: in Hilary And Jackie she took Jacqueline Du Pre, something of a secular saint, and showed her to be a complex, confused and sexual character. Having also played Angela McCourt, she is aware of the peril of playing real people. 'It is a huge responsibility. Unless you make something incredibly bland, you're going to upset somebody. It's tricky, and I felt a bit stung by the whole thing with Hilary And Jackie . I was quite taken aback by the reaction to that. The way the press were talking about it, as if it was salacious tittle-tattle. It just so wasn't.' </p> <p> The Luzhin (pronounced as in illusion, according to Nabokov himself ) Defence isn't a showpiece for her on the scale of Breaking The Waves or Hilary And Jackie. Not that she's not good in it: she is. But it's not that kind of part. The film is a well-appointed costume drama but is turned into something more interesting by Turturro's performance as a damaged chess genius. Watson found someone else playing a traumatised character an interesting expe rience. 'I did have more of an appreciation of how, when you're in the thick of it - you think that everybody understands what you are going through. They don't. You have to stay in that world, it is so easy to destroy it. During Breaking The Waves, I was on my own in a hotel room. I think I would have been impossible to live with. When you go home, you have to pretend to be the person you are at home.' </p> <p>There is no obvious biographical reason why Watson should be so adept at trauma. She seems happy in her life in Camden with her husband, actor/writer Jack Waters, with whom she is working on a screenplay. And the only strange thing about her childhood seems to be the way her parents took a certain kind of educated, middle-class approach to life to its extreme. 'I grew up without a television. It meant that I read lots of books and entertained myself. I missed things: There's a huge gap in my knowledge of popular culture basically, because of it.

      "bodyText": "Emily Watson is distracted. She's staring at the cover of the book on the table. The book is Vladimir Nabokov's The Luzhin Defence, now - it almost certainly says - a major film starring John Turturro and Emily Watson. Watson is on the cover, although you couldn't really tell: she's got her head turned away from the camera, towards Turturro. Both are soaked. 'Why did they choose this picture?' she's asking. 'That scene isn't even in the film. We got halfway through shooting it when the rain pump broke down, so it was all a disaster. We managed to realign the story so we didn't need it.' Meeting Watson is strange. Beforehand, everyone says she's very nice, and so she is. In most ways she seems like a very average 33-year-old Londoner, if one on the more grown-up end of the spectrum. In person, she's more elegant than you expect: tall and wearing a dark green top and pale green trousers that accentuate her height. But Watson isn't an average Camden Town resident, still less your average actress. She received best actress Oscar nominations for her first film, Breaking The Waves and also for Hilary And Jackie. And even that doesn't do her justice: Breaking The Waves was hardly Academy-fodder, being foreign, strange, brutal and sexual. The force of Watson's performance meant that the Academy was forced to pay attention. Her impact has been so powerful so fast that it is a surprise when you realise how few films she's done.

      "body": "<b> Mark, mid-forties</b> <p>'I went into therapy telling myself it was because I had decided to train to become a psychoanalyst, and therapy is part of the training, but I knew that I had stuff of my own to deal with. At the bottom of my problem was the fact that I was adopted when I was a baby, and it had left me with a barely conscious sense of deep abandonment. My adoptive family was fine, but I grew up like a cuckoo in their nest. I liked different things: I was quite academic and they were a very non-academic family. To this day, I'm the only member of the family from any generation to go to university. </p> <p>'Growing up, I felt a low level of unhappiness all the time. To a large extent I cauterised my feelings, but I was always angry, and socially incompetent. If I'd met myself, I wouldn't have liked myself. I chose psychoanalysis, which is one of the most demanding - and expensive - therapies. I went for an hour a day, four days a week, for just over a year. I wasn't a good patient. I intellectualised the process. </p> <p>'It was only gradually that I relinquished control, and that's when the therapy began to really affect me. For the first time, I let myself not be strong and in control. It was a very big thing for me, very liberating. Sometimes I'd become incredibly emotional. I'd drive home from sessions weeping in the car. </p> <p>'My adoptive family were blue-collar workers, and my birth mother, whom I'd met a few years before, was an academic. I began to idealise her family. During analysis I met my mother again, and my analyst helped me to understand my real feelings about her as the person who had abandoned me, and to get a more adult distance from the family. It's easy to underestimate the damage done to children by their parents. </p> <p>'I've always been good at my job, but I've also always had a unique ability to piss people off at work. I could never work out exactly why, but I seemed to rub people up the wrong way. As a consequence, my career has usually been most successful when I've been self-employed. During analysis, a really good job came up and I applied for it. I got it, and not only that, I became a pivotal person at the office, the consiglieri . That had never happened to me before, and I don't think it would have done without therapy. </p> <p>'I'm certainly calmer, less angry and more open. But the biggest effect went beyond individual examples. The best way I can describe it is to say that it gave me a completely new language - the language of emotions. It taught me to understand my own feelings and motivations, but also how to understand other people's. I gave it up because the emotional and financial commitment became too demanding, but what I learned from it, emotionally and intellectually, has stayed with me. I experienced it as something profound that was also slightly ludicrous.' </p> <p><b> Jennifer, early thirties</b> </p> <p>'I went into therapy a few years ago, because I was suddenly stuck in my life and needed to get unstuck. I'd been through a period of secret cocaine-taking, which I had pulled myself out of, but the feelings that had caused it stayed with me. I hated my job in publishing, but I didn't know what else to do or how to do it, and my old, old issues with my father were still there. He'd always been a terrible bully while I was growing up. I made myself strong to stand up to him, but it also made me scared of vulnerability and commitment. </p> <p>'At the beginning, I loved therapy. There is real value in talking about yourself for a whole hour to someone who doesn't interrupt or get bored or tell you exactly why you're completely wrong and a pain in the arse. But I've always talked about myself with close friends, and I'm used to having a relationship - I tell them, they tell me. My therapist just listened. She didn't talk about herself, and I started to find that really annoying. It seemed contrived and unnatural. </p> <p>'The therapy did give me clarity, but there were elements of it I really didn't like. Reliving my vulnerability as a child was horrible - I felt I'd moved on from that and I didn't want to go back. And once we got past talking about how stuck I felt and getting on to possible solutions, I backed off. I just wasn't ready to make those big changes. </p> <p>'It served its purpose for me, but after three months I'd had enough. It's a good way to kick-start yourself, but I'm very suspicious of people who stay in therapy for ages. I'm inclined to introspection and analysis myself, but you can get too much up your own bum. It's very valuable for getting your thoughts and feelings straight, but it's not a substitute for experience. Things happen to us - we make mistakes, we mess up and hopefully that's what moves us on. I think some people try to short-cut that process in therapy.' </p> <p><b> Sarah, mid-thirties</b> </p> <p>'When I was 18 I was engaged and had my own mortgage - embracing adult responsibilities as soon as I could, even though I wasn't ready for them. I reacted by drinking huge amounts and behaving as destructively as I could. </p> <p>'I first tried therapy in my early twenties, and had a bad experience. I went to one of these \"healing centres\", and was put into group therapy. It was too full-on for me - very confrontational. There were all these people weeping and screaming and punching cushions, and I remember feeling very uncomfortable. There was one particularly drippy woman there who kept whingeing that nobody liked her or valued her. The therapist said it wasn't true. Then she made us all say in turn that we loved her. Well, I didn't love her, and everything about it felt fake to me. </p> <p>'That put me off for years, but I went back into therapy in my thirties because I felt as if my life was in real crisis. I'd been married, had a child and got divorced. Then I met my current boyfriend and fell madly in love. He had been a drug addict but was in recovery. </p> <p>'I got pregnant, and he had a serious relapse. He went off the rails at a point when I felt most vulnerable. I was so angry, and so desperate. I felt so bad I believed that I needed to be hospitalised. Instead, I saw a woman therapist who calmed me down and got me over the crisis. She was a gentle, warm, affirmative person. She helped me to see past the cloud of rage and panic to my real situation. She also helped me see that there was nothing I could do to change my boyfriend, and that I would have to set boundaries for what I would and wouldn't accept from him. </p> <p>'Thankfully, he did recover. I'll always be grateful to that therapist, but after the crisis was over, I felt I needed to move on to a different kind of practitioner. I found a wonderful man, who specialises in addiction issues. My boyfriend and I see him together, and it has helped us more than I can describe. I also discovered that I've got what the therapist calls an \"addictive portfolio\" - shopaholic, workaholic, foodie. </p> <p>'It's important to make the links. A huge part of it has been coming to terms with my own anger - something I've had since I was a child. Sometimes I'd be angry with my boyfriend or one of my children, and he'd make me see it was left over anger from other relationships and betrayals. A big part of therapy is just becoming conscious about your own emotional issues.'</p>",

A huge part of it has been coming to terms with my own anger - something I've had since I was a child. Sometimes I'd be angry with my boyfriend or one of my children, and he'd make me see it was left over anger from other relationships and betrayals. A big part of therapy is just becoming conscious about your own emotional issues.'",

      "bodyText": "The United Nations is set to launch an attack on the Government's record on race relations, after condemnation from more than 30 British human rights and ethnic minority groups. The criticism is contained in a report submitted by the groups to the UN committee responsible for monitoring racism. It contains claims that the Government's policy on asylum-seekers 'gives comfort to racists' and has led to increased racial tension. It also criticises Ministers for failing to grapple with police hostility to the findings of the Macpherson inquiry into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence. The UN Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination meets every three years and last reported on Britain as Labour came to power. Campaigners believe its findings will, therefore, provide a clear picture of race relations in Tony Blair's Britain. Officials from the Home Office and the Foreign Office will fly tomorrow to Geneva in an attempt to head off the criticism. They will claim that they have met most of the committee's recommendations from 1997. The civil rights and anti-racist groups will make presentations on asylum-seekers, deaths in custody and education. The report has been compiled by the civil rights group Liberty and the anti-racist 1990 Trust from submissions by groups that include the Refugee Council. Maxie Hayles, of the Birmingham Racial Attacks Monitoring Unit, said he had failed to notice any significant change in police attitudes since the Macpherson report was published in February 1999. 'Although there have been some improvements in police policy, this is not getting down to the bully boys on the ground.' he said. The report contains a list of six major areas of concern: \u0095 The number of racist attacks have increased. \u0095 People from ethnic minorities are more likely to be stopped and searched. \u0095 Immigration and asylum policy has become a threat to good race relations. \u0095 New race relation legislation includes exemptions for immigration policy. \u0095 Certain ethnic minorities are more likely to be unemployed. \u0095 Little improvement in the representation of ethnic minorities in public life. It is hoped that the committee will demand public inquiries into the deaths in custody of Alton Manning and Roger Sylvester and the killing of Zahid Mubarak while he was at Feltham young offenders' institution. However, Brenda Weinberg, chair of the United Families and Friends Campaign, which works for the relatives of people who have died in custody, said she was sceptical that anything would come of government plans to set up a fully independent police complaints procedure. The Home Office told The Observer that it had presented its own submission to the discrimination committee (CERD) last May, but said officials would be providing the UN with an update when they arrive tomorrow. 'We are are confident we have fulfilled our reporting obligations to the UN,' a spokesman said.

      "body": "<p> The start of my travelling gap year can be summed up in one word - fear. There was no excitement, anticipation or thoughts of adventure. My best friend Laura and I got on the plane, looked at each other and thought, 'What on earth are we doing?' </p> <p> We both cried practically all the way to LA and kept saying to each other, 'If we hate it we can come back' - and we honestly thought we would. In LA we were miserable: my parents had booked us a hotel which had fallen through - not what we needed on our first night away. The Holiday Inn was horrible to us and didn't make us feel any better about the fact that we'd just left home for eight months. We then got our connecting flight to Fiji.</p> <p> Once we arrived, we had one drink - and it all changed! Suddenly it was the most exciting thing in the world: we were exploring islands, catching local buses to remote villages, getting lost and having to hitch-hike back - the fear was gone and we were having the times of our lives. We were to spend a large proportion of our gap year in Australia - a mixture of work and travel. On arriving we stayed with friends with whom we fell out. Then we moved to a flat where we slept on a sofabed together surrounded by mess and often drunken Aussies - and absolutely loved it. </p> <p> We got jobs in a local restaurant and then explored the Harbour City. Our advantage was that we were looking round Sydney as locals - we were working and living with Australians so we just developed an entirely new lifestyle. We had got working visas before we left, which were valid for a year and cost less than \u00a3100. You could work anywhere you liked, but for no longer than three months at a time. </p> <p> After about four months we travelled to Melbourne, through the middle of Australia and then down the East Coast. This is when we became tourists, staying in hostels, scuba diving, bungee jumping and drinking excessive amounts of beer with fellow Brits, Swedes and Danes. Some of the trips we took were very long. It was a 36-hour bus journey from Ayers Rock, now known as Uluru, to the East Coast, and this was hot and uncomfortable - but seeing the Rock and King's Canyon in central Australia were definitely worth it. I would recommend anyone to take that journey. </p> <p> In fact, all the trips were worth the money, although if I did it again I'd get my diving certificate when I was on the Great Barrier Reef. It was travelling that Laura and I had our only low points. Moving around all the time, never unpacking and not having time on your own can get you down after a while. If you want to just slump, there are people in your room. The communal areas are always heaving and, after a while, we both found this quite hard. </p> <p> Once back in Sydney, we couldn't leave. We had intended to go to New Zealand and San Francisco, but we extended our time in Oz instead. We got our old jobs back and went skiing with friends - we'd fallen in love with the place - and some rather cute surfers too. Laura and I left for these travels in February after leaving school, and had both been working in the interim. We had about \u00a34,000 saved each, after having paid for our flights. Some of this money was in an Australian bank account; my father was in charge of the rest, both to pay off my credit card bills and to top up my Australian account when needed. </p> <p> We both kept budget books, which we updated weekly by keeping all our receipts and payslips. As soon as we arrived, we started work - even though we had enough money stacked up. If you can work in a restaurant or bar, the money is fantastic. It is paid like a temping job would be in England, and if you work weekends and late at night, the money increases even more. You earn enough to live very comfortably, and get the added advantage of meeting the locals. However, the money we saved while working in England and in Sydney went quickly up the East Coast. The hostels are expensive - although dorms are cheaper - and buying your coach ticket is a hefty sum. We bought a ticket that let you jump on and off a specified route, which was brilliant as there were no restrictions. Obviously we found sneaky ways to save money. We'd catch coaches overnight - getting a good night's sleep without the cost of a hostel. But you don't realise how much you can spend when travelling. During the day you are constantly getting drinks, food or paying for galleries or entertainment. When we were there we both vowed that we would never worry about money and not do something because of cash restrictions as we may regret it later. We decided that we'd prefer to come back to England with vast overdrafts and then pay them off. Australia is not cheap, but there are opportunities to work all around the country. It could be done more cheaply if you bought a car and camped, but being two girls on our own, away for the first time, we decided not to do it like that. Looking back on it we'd have been absolutely fine. </p> <p> So what did I think of my year off? I still regret not doing something a bit more 'worthy' and actually helping someone. On the other hand, on organised gap years, people tend to get 'mothered' and it's really just like a long school trip to somewhere far away. A lot of people explored more countries than we did, adding South East Asia to their itinerary. This would have been fantastic, but we needed to work to keep our money topped up, and we now have the advantage of knowing a city inside out, having lived there as residents. There's plenty of time to go elsewhere and we preferred to explore places properly. </p> <p> We gained experience that was invaluable at that time in our lives. We learnt to be independent. We sorted out everything from our jobs and taxes to remembering to buy groceries and wash our knickers. We'd both been at day school so this was the first occasion we'd left home for any length of time. We also learnt to budget. When I got to university it was obvious who had been away for a year - we had loads to talk about and we no longer acted like kids just out of the classroom. For instance, those who had come straight from school were throwing up everywhere at the Freshers' Ball. </p> <p> What are the cons then? When I came back home I was an absolute nightmare. I was so miserable to be back - I'd met someone in Australia and fallen in love and I wanted to stay in Sydney with him. I announced that I did not want to go to university: I wanted to travel more, return to Australia, and defer a year. My parents had a few words to say about that. My mother thought that I was being such a lunatic that she hid my passport, thinking that I would run away in the night, and I was so mad I probably would have. Laura was also so miserable when she got back that she hopped on a plane and went back for another six months. This was a major negative point of travelling. The feeling of complete despondency and disorientation on return was horrible. </p> <p> The other problems included my mother sorting out my university accommodation, which meant that I was in a university hall full of the most awful people. I also put on two stone while I was away, thanks to vast quantities of beer and the 9p-a-packet noodles eaten in gargantuan quantities. But, all in all, my gap year was one of the best times of my life. As for the Australian love of my life, he fell by the wayside after about the second week of university. He came to visit for Christmas - but you'll have to ask my parents about that, as he ended up staying with them for three months. </p> <p> \u0095 Katie graduated in physiology from Bristol University last year.

The parents of the girl, who cannot be identified, have said that her expulsion from her secondary school a year before her GCSE exams could do irreparable damage to her education. The girl, from the South East, was expelled on the last day of the summer term. As a result, she will appear at a magistrates' hearing this week on a minor criminal charge. Her case, which will be taken after the criminal investigation is completed, will test Article 6 of the Convention, the right to a fair trial. It is claimed that new procedures for appealing against exclusions do not give enough rights to the school child or parents. It will be the first of a series of cases involving education and gay rights which will test the limits of the Act, which comes into force in October. The girl's solicitor, David Ruebain, said that because of changes to the right of appeal against exclusions, it was difficult to see how children who were expelled could get a fair hearing. Last month David Blunkett, the Education Secretary, announced that schools had the right to override the appeals process if they thought the child was a threat to other children. 'There is a view that the new guidance is a breach of Article 6,' Ruebain said. 'What is the point of an appeals process if that appeals process can be overridden?' Because the girl was expelled on the last day of term, she will not be able to appeal against exclusion until the first day of the new term. By then the exclusion policy will be in place and by the time her case comes to court the human rights act will also be in force. Stonewall, the gay rights group, is considering a number of cases where it can be proved that employers are not giving the same rights to gay partners of employees as to married couples.",

In the aptly named Scotland Yard Playground, Grid Iron Theatre Company have arranged a circle of child-size stools for their audience.

Observing the exacting rules is as unnerving as taking the entrance exam for the Civil Service; falling short - as does the wee, bullied Decky - means exclusion. </p> <p>The plot of Decky ends grimly.

Salty and sardonic, it casts the woman who was once considered a witch as the archetype of the wronged woman. The chorus, in dove-grey, with knotted hair, is a politicised crew of widows, mistresses, wives - all recently- turned worms. Jason is a male-chauvinist pig; Kreon an old-style master, buttoned-up like a church elder or an advocate. </p> <p>There's nothing even-handed about this: it pushes an argument about the unfair lot dealt to women. Nor does it in the end give a really convincing reason - what could it be? - for Medea's murder of her children. But you can quarrel with nothing else in an absorbing, galvanic evening. </p> <p>Maureen Beattie - alone in red, and isolated in her speech, as the incomer in a Scots-speaking Establishment - is magnificent. Her anger is the more effective for containing displays of deflationary humour with which she cajoles the audience before her blackest deeds; she purrs without cease. A national tour follows. </p> <p>You don't often hear people crying in the theatre. But you do during The Bogus Woman. Kay Adshead's play, presented by The Red Room and Mamo Quillo, is a body-blow. </p> <p>Delivered with top-velocity grace by Noma Dumezweni on a brutally bare stage - there's a slop bucket and some gnawed blocks of wood - the play tells the story of an African journalist whose father, husband and baby daughter have been butchered, who has been raped by soldiers, fled her country and who wants to stay in England. 'Why', inquires one of the sweetly sceptical admission officers of the asylum-seeker, 'did they rape you and not kill you?' </p> <p>It's a fictional account in as much as it is the story of no particular woman's life; it's a documentary account in that it draws on the facts of many lives - part of Adshead's research involved talking to a refugee charged with causing riot and affray at the Campsfield Detention Centre in 1997. The result is, she has said, a history 'more shocking than some and less shocking than others'. </p> <p>Its effect is increased by an almost Grecian restraint. The violence has already taken place; what the audience observe is a series of dogged humiliations: casual racial insults from the officers in the camp; the institutionalised contempt which delivers weeny food vouchers and insecure lodgings. Dumezweni makes you feel you are inhabiting a world behind the headlines. </p> <p>Other Traverse shows seem wan in comparison: while nearly every play has something to recommend it, few come across as urgent. Kate Atkinson's likable Abandonment is a case in point. It's in many respects a good advertisement for her novels: full of good sentences and funny, with themes woven together as intricately as a bird's nest. </p> <p>The device of parallel lives seems particularly congenial for examining the stories of women's lives. Atkinson's heroine is a twentieth-century historian, left by her mother as an infant, dumped by her lover, who finds a way of building a family of her own - and whose life is shadowed by that of a nineteenth-century governess. </p> <p>The cast double up across the two time zones: at one point, the faithless lover cradles both Victorian and modern woman. </p> <p>There are no loose ends here: the structure is the story; and it's a story warmly realised in design and warmth of acting. But despite its intimate touches, you are left admiring an apparatus rather than feeling compelled by the heroine. A bit more abandon would have come in handy. </p> <p>Zinnie Harris's Further than the Furthest Thing, a joint production between the Tron and the National, is also freighted with good ideas, not carried lightly. Inspired by the experience of the inhabitants of Tristan da Cunha, evacuated to England in the Sixties when a volcano erupted, it evokes a displanted island culture, whose survival is threatened by realpolitik and metropolitan commercialism. </p> <p>Niki Turner's design is striking: a paralysed wasteland in which stony slopes are supervised by a frozen gush of water. There's a beautifully judged performance by Paola Dionisotti - precise, proudly spoken, emotionally disarrayed. But its boldest stroke - the creation of an island patois - confines its characters to quaintness. </p> <p>Meanwhile, The Donkey Show is playing to packed houses with its clubbing adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream . There's no dialogue, but a carnival of undulating, roller-skating, tattooed bodies. Titania, in thigh-high shiny boots and a ruff of peacock feathers, gives new resonance to her name, with butterflies perched on her nipples. As the lovers lose each other in a forest of people, Helena sings 'Don't leave me this way'. The magic potion is a bag of cocaine. It's very New York - and very Edinburgh.</p>",

Stripping 13 nights of a pub quiz across prime time (ITV's Who Wants to be a Millionaire?) is a winner, as is experimenting with soft pornography in the late- night schedules (Channel 5) and, now, prurient social experimentation. 'Original drama' will still be the mainstay of the schedule as long as it is good enough (Cold Feet) or sufficiently 'different' to build a following despite limitations of plot and script (Bad Girls). But Big Brother-style experiments should be celebrated and embraced, even by those who are not keen viewers themselves. After all, if you don't like it, you can always read a book.",

      "body": "<p>Honey is what you get when bees collect nectar from flowers and break it down with their spit. Something to think about next time you watch the golden syrup slowly dissolve into your herbal tea. </p> <p>But it is also the ultimate luxury for the sweet of tooth - a fat pot of liquid gold with which to dip, drizzle and spread. Unlike jam or golden syrup, honey gets a nod of approval from the health police. Yet ask them to explain exactly why its sucrose, fructose and maltose are superior to the stuff in the sugar bowl, and their reasons rapidly descend into folklore. 'Honey is a natural antiseptic,' they cry, before flying away on their broomsticks. </p> <p>The true magic of honey is not what it did for aficionado Barbara Cartland - who was prolifically penning romantic novels into her late nineties - but how it is made, a procedure surely worth a few moments of anyone's daydreams on a sunny afternoon. Watching a portly bumblebee at work in the lavender has always had me reaching, Pooh-like, for the honey pot. A pot that belongs to a time when the summers were longer, the world smelled of honeysuckle and toast, and honey was part of a Sunday garden tea rather than a snatched weekday breakfast wolfed on the run. </p> <p>However much our lives have speeded up, honey still moves at its own leisurely pace, falling slowly from the spoon on to thick slices of toast, into heavy Greek yogurt or, sacrilegiously, on to porridge. (It will get a move on if you can be bothered to heat the spoon first.) I regard honey dippers, those bee-shaped wooden stirrers you get in your Christmas stocking, in much the same way I do any kitchen gadget - as just another thing I can live without. They are pretty pointless for the crystalline, glucose-laden lavender honeys I prefer. </p> <p>The floral and herbal notes of the purest honey depend on which flowers' nectar the bees have been gathering. How beekeepers keep track of this is a mystery. I have visions of lone apiarists furtively following their swarm, peeping from behind trees, little black book in hand, recording every flower visited. The answer has much to do with where the hives are located and what flowers happen to be in season. </p> <p>Over the years, I have sampled the floral notes from raspberry flower (imperceptible) and orange blossom (charming) to acacia (revered but nevertheless boring) and the mysterious rhododendron (you could have fooled me). The one scented with herbs from the garrigue - the short, woody brush that covers so much of southwestern France - is memorable for its deep, almost cough-linctus back notes. Those from lavender fields remain a great favourite, and not just for the cute picture of hives among the rows of mauve bushes. They all have their fans, though I have yet to finish a whole jar of any of them. You could almost measure my life in pots of unfinished honey. </p> <p>As with Dairylea, roast beef and Dandelion &amp; Burdock, my lust for honey is an occasional one. But it is unmistakably lust. What appeals is gouging the fudge-like, flower-scented paste from its pot and spreading it on thick slices of pale toast. It does not matter how generously I spread it, even the thinnest scraping is sweet enough to subdue the craving for a while. I have been known to set out especially to buy a jar or even two, a honey-fix if you like, but find that good though it is, one spoonful is always enough. </p> <p>It is this sweetness that demands much thought from the cook once the romance of a new jar has faded and it is 'off to the kitchen' with it. Some balance is needed. Sadly, the herbal and floral notes present in raw honey fade once it is heated. Gentle warmth will bring the flavours to the surface; fierce heat will send them scuttling away. But you can cook with them effectively enough if you temper their shock of sweetness with lemon, vinegar or ginger, and remember that generosity is not always a good thing. </p> <p>Honey is used chiefly with duck, in which case its sugar-coating is harnessed with the aniseed of star anise and the salt-shock of soy sauce; with chicken, where lemon, orange and ginger are included, and most successfully with pork. It seems strange that the sweetest of meats should benefit from the stickiest of preserves, but it does. The clue is to add a carefully judged squirt of acidity in the form of lemon or lime juice or white-wine vinegar. It does little for the meat itself, but wonders for the pan juices, which take on a deep, sweet savour and a burnished gloss. </p> <p>The texture of honey depends, like the flavour, on where the bees collected their nectar. The higher the glucose content of the nectar, the thicker the honey. I find those varieties such as clover, some of the older, more granulated heather honey and the lavender varieties a particularly unctuous spread for toast or soft farmhouse white bread. This is the best way to pick up the discreet floral notes.

As the oil starts to simmer, add the pork chops, not moving them till their undersides are golden - a matter of a minute or two. Meanwhile, slice the mushrooms (not too thinly). Turn the chops over and colour the other side, then push them to the side of the pan and add the sliced mushrooms, turning them briefly in the pan juices. Lay the chops on top and turn off the heat. </p> <p>Season the meat with salt, ground black pepper and several good pinches of oregano. You can, of course, use fresh oregano leaves, but the dried herb works exceptionally well in this instance. Squeeze over the lemon then add the spent shells to the dish. Drizzle over the honey, but no more than a couple of tablespoons' worth. </p> <p>Bake the chops for 20 to 25 minutes at 200 C/gas mark 6, basting them once or twice as they cook.

      "bodyText": "Honey is what you get when bees collect nectar from flowers and break it down with their spit. Something to think about next time you watch the golden syrup slowly dissolve into your herbal tea. But it is also the ultimate luxury for the sweet of tooth - a fat pot of liquid gold with which to dip, drizzle and spread. Unlike jam or golden syrup, honey gets a nod of approval from the health police. Yet ask them to explain exactly why its sucrose, fructose and maltose are superior to the stuff in the sugar bowl, and their reasons rapidly descend into folklore. 'Honey is a natural antiseptic,' they cry, before flying away on their broomsticks. The true magic of honey is not what it did for aficionado Barbara Cartland - who was prolifically penning romantic novels into her late nineties - but how it is made, a procedure surely worth a few moments of anyone's daydreams on a sunny afternoon. Watching a portly bumblebee at work in the lavender has always had me reaching, Pooh-like, for the honey pot. A pot that belongs to a time when the summers were longer, the world smelled of honeysuckle and toast, and honey was part of a Sunday garden tea rather than a snatched weekday breakfast wolfed on the run. However much our lives have speeded up, honey still moves at its own leisurely pace, falling slowly from the spoon on to thick slices of toast, into heavy Greek yogurt or, sacrilegiously, on to porridge. (It will get a move on if you can be bothered to heat the spoon first.) I regard honey dippers, those bee-shaped wooden stirrers you get in your Christmas stocking, in much the same way I do any kitchen gadget - as just another thing I can live without. They are pretty pointless for the crystalline, glucose-laden lavender honeys I prefer. The floral and herbal notes of the purest honey depend on which flowers' nectar the bees have been gathering. How beekeepers keep track of this is a mystery. I have visions of lone apiarists furtively following their swarm, peeping from behind trees, little black book in hand, recording every flower visited. The answer has much to do with where the hives are located and what flowers happen to be in season. Over the years, I have sampled the floral notes from raspberry flower (imperceptible) and orange blossom (charming) to acacia (revered but nevertheless boring) and the mysterious rhododendron (you could have fooled me). The one scented with herbs from the garrigue - the short, woody brush that covers so much of southwestern France - is memorable for its deep, almost cough-linctus back notes. Those from lavender fields remain a great favourite, and not just for the cute picture of hives among the rows of mauve bushes. They all have their fans, though I have yet to finish a whole jar of any of them. You could almost measure my life in pots of unfinished honey. As with Dairylea, roast beef and Dandelion &amp; Burdock, my lust for honey is an occasional one. But it is unmistakably lust. What appeals is gouging the fudge-like, flower-scented paste from its pot and spreading it on thick slices of pale toast. It does not matter how generously I spread it, even the thinnest scraping is sweet enough to subdue the craving for a while. I have been known to set out especially to buy a jar or even two, a honey-fix if you like, but find that good though it is, one spoonful is always enough. It is this sweetness that demands much thought from the cook once the romance of a new jar has faded and it is 'off to the kitchen' with it. Some balance is needed. Sadly, the herbal and floral notes present in raw honey fade once it is heated. Gentle warmth will bring the flavours to the surface; fierce heat will send them scuttling away. But you can cook with them effectively enough if you temper their shock of sweetness with lemon, vinegar or ginger, and remember that generosity is not always a good thing. Honey is used chiefly with duck, in which case its sugar-coating is harnessed with the aniseed of star anise and the salt-shock of soy sauce; with chicken, where lemon, orange and ginger are included, and most successfully with pork. It seems strange that the sweetest of meats should benefit from the stickiest of preserves, but it does. The clue is to add a carefully judged squirt of acidity in the form of lemon or lime juice or white-wine vinegar. It does little for the meat itself, but wonders for the pan juices, which take on a deep, sweet savour and a burnished gloss. The texture of honey depends, like the flavour, on where the bees collected their nectar. The higher the glucose content of the nectar, the thicker the honey. I find those varieties such as clover, some of the older, more granulated heather honey and the lavender varieties a particularly unctuous spread for toast or soft farmhouse white bread. This is the best way to pick up the discreet floral notes. Once you start cooking with the stuff, rather than simply spooning it from the jar, you might as well use whatever you have in the cupboard. Tonight there will be honey for tea, and thick white doorsteps of the freshest imaginable bread. A rather old-fashioned tea, I know, but who cares when you get to eat nectar, pollen, royal jelly and the sugar of herbs and flowers? Oh, and that bit of bee spit. Baked pork chops with mushrooms, lemon and honey Savoury chops, a few mushrooms and some sweet herbal juices for a summer lunch. You may like to have a few fancy salad leaves washed and ready on the side. Serves 4, or 2 if you are very hungry. 4 pork steaks or spare-rib chops a little mild olive oil 2 largish mushrooms dried oregano 1 lemon 2 tbsp liquid honey Put a large oval dish or small roasting tin over a moderately high flame and pour in just enough oil to cover the bottom.

Season the meat with salt, ground black pepper and several good pinches of oregano. You can, of course, use fresh oregano leaves, but the dried herb works exceptionally well in this instance. Squeeze over the lemon then add the spent shells to the dish. Drizzle over the honey, but no more than a couple of tablespoons' worth. Bake the chops for 20 to 25 minutes at 200 C/gas mark 6, basting them once or twice as they cook. You will need some salad leaves on your plate to mop up the sweet, herbal juices. Fig, orange and honey cake A truly moist cake, crunchy with fig seeds and scented with honey. Serves 12. 200g ready-to-eat dried figs 225g butter, cool but not hard, cut into small chunks 225g golden caster sugar 100g plain flour 75g ground almonds 4 large eggs, beaten the grated zest of an organic orange the juice of 2 oranges 4 tbsp honey 2 tsp orange-blossom water strained Greek yogurt to serve You will also need a 21cm cake tin, the base lined with baking parchment.

This barren territory does, I suppose, give the lie to the oft-reported claim that we are in the grip of a restaurant boom.

It occupies an attractive site overlooking a weir on the tree-lined River Derwent to the north of the city, and is part of a development of a hulking, old Victorian mill.

One of the reasons there are a lot of good restaurants in London is that there are a lot of good restaurants in London. Put another way, chefs raise their game if they know the punters could be going elsewhere. The fine town of Ludlow in Shropshire has no particular reason for being of note where eating out is concerned, for example, but because Shaun Hill's Merchant House and Ken Adam's Oaks Restaurant are both there, other chefs have now crowded in and it has become something of a foodie mecca. </p> <p>Darley's, meanwhile, has to 'go for the rosettes' without anything to judge itself by. That, at least, can be my only explanation for my rather lacklustre lunch. This is not to say that Darley's is a bad place. The service is very friendly and efficient, the room light and airy, and there is a dinner menu both reasonably priced and ambitious which promised an interesting busyness on the plate: 'Twice-baked goat's cheese souffl\u00e9, salad of grilled red peppers, tapanade and pistachio-nut vinaigrette' to start, for example (\u00a36.90); 'Caramelised breast of Gressingham duck, Oriental vegetable spring roll, black cherry compote with Thai chilli dressing' as a main course (\u00a317.50). </p> <p>Three courses at lunch is good value at \u00a314.50. To start, I chose grilled sardines with what was described as a 'vine tomato fondue', because doing grilled sardines well in a restaurant of some ambition is very difficult. The fondue was just a thick tomato sauce, and not a particularly distinguished one at that. As to the fish, it was a bit of a mistake to gut one and not the other; there's nothing wrong with an ungutted sardine as long as it's cooked properly. But a little consistency on the plate goes a long way. </p> <p>My main course, honey-basted belly pork with celeriac pur\u00e9e, compote of figs, beans and crackling also displayed a similar lack of attention to detail. The crackling was perfect, the meat fine, but the celeriac pur\u00e9e was grossly over salted and the compote was an overly crude and lumpy affair, plonked on the plate with little thought for presentation. For pudding, the best part of the lunch, I went local and ordered the Bakewell tart with a raspberry coulis. It was more of a cake than a tart, the customary slick of jam replaced with crush of fresh raspberries, and all the jollier for that. Unfortunately, it was then let down by a truly dismal cup of insipid coffee. </p> <p>I have no doubt that Darley's has a dedicated band of loyal fans.

Anthony Bourdain, 25 years a New York chef, has been a soldier in that battle all his blood-stained, sweat-sodden working life and this coruscating account of his years in combat stinks of it.</p> <p>The military metaphors are his, not mine. They lurk not just in the language of 'crews' or 'brigades' that he forms about him in his kitchens, but in the total approach to the life that the working chef must lead. Hell, these boys are even armed, with serious lengths of thrice-sharpened steel. </p> <p>In one sequence, Bourdain describes how he and his sous-chefs, strung out on a rich stew of dope, amphetamines and overwork, would re-enact the opening sequences of the movie Apocalypse Now as an overture to the evening service. As a finale, they would recreate the napalm blast by emptying half a pint of brandy over the range so that it would ignite, sending a sheet of flame powering through the kitchen. They were, he says, happy days. Eventually, the restaurant went bust. </p> <p>Most of the restaurants where Bourdain served went bust. It is that litany of failure which distinguishes this book. Although he is now an established figure in New York, executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles, a faux French joint serving up brasserie staples, for most of his career he was just a jobbing guy with his knives and his moves and his tricks with demi-glace who tumbled from kitchen to kitchen, rubbing shoulders as often with the Mob as with the suburban dentists turned ill-fated restaurateurs, on a picaresque adventure to put Don Quixote to shame. He was never one of the generals with his daytime TV slot and his name stitched carefully across the breast of his whites. Mind you, the heroin addiction probably had something to do with that. </p> <p>But what really makes Bourdain's writing sing is his complete understanding that food is not a subject for aesthetes. It's a belly thing, not a head thing. From his very first meeting with 'stinky runny cheeses that smelled like a dead man's feet' or his first oyster ('this glistening, vaguely sexual-looking object, still dripping and nearly alive') both while in France with his parents aged just nine, he grasped the true sensuousness of food and eating. </p> <p>The result is an obsession with prime ingredients without any of the tiresome reverence that too often follows on behind. Sometimes, that lack of reverence tumbles into a curious kind of disdain and the book becomes less an education than a warning. It began life as an article in the New Yorker entitled 'Don't Eat Before Reading This', which explained why you should never order fish on Mondays (it's been hanging around since the previous Friday) and why mussels are a terrible dish to order in restaurants ('mussels are allowed to wallow in their own foul-smelling piss in the bottom of a reach-in'). </p> <p>Kitchen Confidential takes it all much further. There are extraordinary accounts of the cooking practices at an esteemed New York restaurant where the chateaubriand would be chucked in the deep-fat fryer to give it a good crust or steaks would be cooked off an hour ahead of time and then reintroduced to heat courtesy of a slick of sauce thrown over them just before service. It also seems you can never be sure which animal provided the juices on your plate; in another manic kitchen overseen by Bourdain, the crew decided that cuts incurred during service were such a badge of honour that they should spray as much of the resulting blood across each other as possible. Can you be sure none of that ended up on your plate? Can you really? </p> <p>For my part, it has made me realise that any respect I had for this newspaper's war correspondents has been entirely misplaced. They are not the ones taking risks with their lives in pursuit of truth. It's me, the restaurant critic. I want danger money and I want it now. It also seems that we should give thanks for fashion; the explosion in the number of restaurants with their kitchens open to the dining-room, so that the punters may watch the dramas, may actually end up saving lives. </p> <p>Kitchen Confidential does have its faults. There are long meditations on the state of the New York restaurant business which will make about as much sense to British readers as an Arabic menu. And there is some unnecessary material here on the stand-up guys he has known which, like toasted pine nuts added to a Caesar salad, don't improve the dish any. </p> <p>But this is to quibble. There are also extraordinary passages here, written with a clarity and a clear-eyed wit to put the professional food writing fraternity to shame. His account of a day in the life of a chef is a tour de force. (The moral of the story: never trust a fat chef; they just aren't working hard enough.) In short, Bourdain has written a bouillabaisse of a book. Which is to say it's a classic, and a ripe one at that. There are very few books which all professional cooks should read but this is one. To Escoffier and Larousse may now be added the name Bourdain.</p>",

They lurk not just in the language of 'crews' or 'brigades' that he forms about him in his kitchens, but in the total approach to the life that the working chef must lead. Hell, these boys are even armed, with serious lengths of thrice-sharpened steel. In one sequence, Bourdain describes how he and his sous-chefs, strung out on a rich stew of dope, amphetamines and overwork, would re-enact the opening sequences of the movie Apocalypse Now as an overture to the evening service. As a finale, they would recreate the napalm blast by emptying half a pint of brandy over the range so that it would ignite, sending a sheet of flame powering through the kitchen. They were, he says, happy days. Eventually, the restaurant went bust. Most of the restaurants where Bourdain served went bust. It is that litany of failure which distinguishes this book. Although he is now an established figure in New York, executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles, a faux French joint serving up brasserie staples, for most of his career he was just a jobbing guy with his knives and his moves and his tricks with demi-glace who tumbled from kitchen to kitchen, rubbing shoulders as often with the Mob as with the suburban dentists turned ill-fated restaurateurs, on a picaresque adventure to put Don Quixote to shame. He was never one of the generals with his daytime TV slot and his name stitched carefully across the breast of his whites. Mind you, the heroin addiction probably had something to do with that. But what really makes Bourdain's writing sing is his complete understanding that food is not a subject for aesthetes. It's a belly thing, not a head thing. From his very first meeting with 'stinky runny cheeses that smelled like a dead man's feet' or his first oyster ('this glistening, vaguely sexual-looking object, still dripping and nearly alive') both while in France with his parents aged just nine, he grasped the true sensuousness of food and eating. The result is an obsession with prime ingredients without any of the tiresome reverence that too often follows on behind. Sometimes, that lack of reverence tumbles into a curious kind of disdain and the book becomes less an education than a warning. It began life as an article in the New Yorker entitled 'Don't Eat Before Reading This', which explained why you should never order fish on Mondays (it's been hanging around since the previous Friday) and why mussels are a terrible dish to order in restaurants ('mussels are allowed to wallow in their own foul-smelling piss in the bottom of a reach-in'). Kitchen Confidential takes it all much further. There are extraordinary accounts of the cooking practices at an esteemed New York restaurant where the chateaubriand would be chucked in the deep-fat fryer to give it a good crust or steaks would be cooked off an hour ahead of time and then reintroduced to heat courtesy of a slick of sauce thrown over them just before service. It also seems you can never be sure which animal provided the juices on your plate; in another manic kitchen overseen by Bourdain, the crew decided that cuts incurred during service were such a badge of honour that they should spray as much of the resulting blood across each other as possible. Can you be sure none of that ended up on your plate? Can you really? For my part, it has made me realise that any respect I had for this newspaper's war correspondents has been entirely misplaced. They are not the ones taking risks with their lives in pursuit of truth. It's me, the restaurant critic. I want danger money and I want it now. It also seems that we should give thanks for fashion; the explosion in the number of restaurants with their kitchens open to the dining-room, so that the punters may watch the dramas, may actually end up saving lives. Kitchen Confidential does have its faults. There are long meditations on the state of the New York restaurant business which will make about as much sense to British readers as an Arabic menu. And there is some unnecessary material here on the stand-up guys he has known which, like toasted pine nuts added to a Caesar salad, don't improve the dish any. But this is to quibble. There are also extraordinary passages here, written with a clarity and a clear-eyed wit to put the professional food writing fraternity to shame. His account of a day in the life of a chef is a tour de force. (The moral of the story: never trust a fat chef; they just aren't working hard enough.) In short, Bourdain has written a bouillabaisse of a book. Which is to say it's a classic, and a ripe one at that. There are very few books which all professional cooks should read but this is one. To Escoffier and Larousse may now be added the name Bourdain.",

      "body": "<p>The Bang has a spring in it. It builds to an echoing climax and then is thrown up into the air. Whoosh, Ka-bang, bo-ing. Then, as the sound lands, a resounding thump. For two teenage boys this is a good noise, a sound rich with all the corollaries of pleasure. For the two adults weeding over the wall it is almost torture, almost an invasion, almost bloody intolerable. But not quite. It shatters the peace that the garden so carefully laces around itself and is an assault of a kind - but one thing saves it. After each elastic, clattering crash is a whoop of laughter. That raucous, pubescent addition to the general row clears and legitimises everything else. Adam and Josh are having fun. </p> <p>I got a nice letter today from a reader of this column asking me to drop by and see the letter-writer's garden, asking me to bring the children, too 'as it is a great place for playing hide and seek'. While it is a charming image (and invitation) it presupposes that my children are locked between the ages of about four and eight. The truth is that gardens are dangerous places for unsupervised toddlers and dead boring for any child over seven. Popular garden lore can accommodate toddlers and young children, and there are a number of books that explore all the delightful ways that small children can enjoy your garden. However, there is always a subtext to these books - children enjoying the garden without trashing it too badly. But trashing things is inevitable, if you are having the right kind of fun. Football and cricket ruin lawns, flowerbeds and greenhouses. (This summer Adam hit a cricket ball through the open door of the greenhouse; it bounced once on the path, miraculously went through an open window and out the other side - straight on to a pile of spare panes resting against the fence. Six sheets of glass, smashed.)</p> <p>Treehouses are most fun with six-inch nails, scaffolding planks, rope and plenty of branches sawn off to fit them in and get a good view. Bicycles make good muddy ruts in paths and, anyway, seem to spend most of their lives thrown down on the ground blocking a doorway.</p> <p>My children are all heavily into blading (or is it skates - the wrong terminology in front of their friends is met with eye-rolling contempt). Hence the half-pipe, which consists of three pieces of 8ft by 4ft marine ply coaxed into curves to make an enormous ramped semicircle so they can swoop down one side, up the other, jump and twist in mid-air and either whizz back down again or fall tumbling on to their backsides. It is brilliant and took the two boys a whole afternoon to make. A variety of tools were used, and the principal ingredient, other than the ply, assorted blocks of wood, concrete blocks, four milk crates, all my nails and a mysterious quantity of rope, is the courtyard garden. This is a minimalist area, refined to an exquisite harmony in stone and wood, the yard paved in York stone, the walls of ancient red sandstone and a square of river-washed pebbles in the centre. Around the perimeter are nine cubes of green oak, now weathering into a silvery-cracked maturity. It is the children's best bit of the garden at the moment, because it is brilliant for blading. Unfortunately, the half-pipe means blocking the only entrance to the walled garden, which is where we eat whenever we can in summer.</p> <p>The walled garden was completely revamped last year for the children. They wanted a lawn near the house. Sarah and I wanted a hard surface near the house. There was a huge open space down the end of the garden, but children like to be near. They like popping in and out. They like the garden as an extension of their bedrooms, and after a day at home the two look pretty similar. So we cleared the four big borders, moving them to the perimeter, and made a lawn in the centre. The trampoline sits in the middle of that patch of grass.</p> <p>Trampolines are just another piece of the affluent family's kit nowadays. Boasting about having a trampoline is dead uncool, and I'm the only one in our household who does it. But the children use it all the time. From the landing window, I can watch my lovely daughter Freya, 12, leaping and flying, headphones on, crazy auburn corkscrew hair shooting out, eyes closed as she dances to the rhythm of her CD Walkman. Actually it is mine and was a birthday present, but she has nabbed it. Nine-year-old Tom goes and jumps when he is angry, and it soothes him. Adam and his friends, Josh and George, all 14, fight and laugh and swear in that hoarse, shouty way 14-year-olds do, like boisterous, awkward cubs. The funny thing is that Sarah and I ignore the trampoline - which totally dominates the space - in the same way that they ignore the subtleties of the planting - all pastels and whites - around their leaping selves. We accommodate each other's needs by pretending that they are temporary.</p> <p>And, of course, on every level, they are. The children grow as fast as the garden, and they change their demands from the garden almost daily. Certainly by the time you have established any kind of set-up for them, they have moved on to something else. What children beyond the hide-and-seek age want is a kind of loosely equipped playground with enough familiarity so that they can loaf comfortably, but with enough novelty to make the world up afresh as the spirit takes them.</p> <p>Horticulture doesn't come into it. My daughter made a garden this year and did it carefully and well. But once made - which took her perhaps three sessions of an hour spread over a week - it was forgotten. Everything was in the doing of it. In fact, it has thrived and her sweet peas are every bit as good as ours, despite total neglect. Tom periodically makes camps and treehouses but his are all essentially hiding places. One was elaborately dug out and then camouflaged to look like a stack of brashings (sweet that he does not think I know every stick and leaf of this garden) and he has a series of flowerpots sunk in the ground, covered over with a tile and then hidden by soil. They each contain an emblematic piece of him, like a key or a sweet. He roams this garden like a member of the Resistance, seemingly compliant to its strict regulations and adult, horticultural tyranny, but really possessing it as fully as anyone.</p> <p>And there is his shed. This is strictly private and entrance is by invitation only. There are a series of notices to that effect, the latest of which reads: 'BUGER OF, I LIVE HEAR' - he's not so hot on spelling, our Tom, but he has other skills. His shed is a serious workshop and much more highly sophisticated than anything I possess or am able to employ.</p> <p>At the age of nine, he can make almost anything that he sets his mind to, copying things seen on television or in magazines, or making up inventions. He makes things all day. Nothing is more admirable. Yet his mess spreads like a dervish workshop ripple from his shed to the farthest reaches of the garden, with saws, power drills, hammers, endless bits of wood, plastic, metal and string put down and abandoned wherever the fancy has taken him. And he bangs an awful lot. Boys in the garden always equal noise. Tom seems to foray out from his shed with the tools of the moment and to work wherever the action is. This is not just limited to the garden but has now ventured quietly out into cyberspace. I got a bill the other day for a domain name registered as www.tomshed.com that he had set up entirely on his own. I think perhaps that tomshed.com is the most accurate metaphor for a growing child's garden - a mental space of limitless imagination founded on the comfort of an actual, utterly safe haven.</p> <p>Inevitably, the real garden with a growing family of children will be untidy, messy even, noisy and often destructive. It drives arch control-freaks like myself mad. But I hate it when they are not there. </p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>All change. All the broad beans and peas are up and on the compost heap, and purple kale, red cabbage, purple sprouts and purple-sprouting broccoli have replaced them. You may notice a theme. The idea is that the winter is fundamentally a brown and grey place here, and while green is good and to be encouraged, purple is better. It also seems to make the green greener while diminishing the brown. So the greener brassicas - calabrese, savoys, cavolo nero - have all been planted out up the top end of the garden where the garlic was. </p> <p>Garlic is good for the soil and most things thrive that follow it on a piece of ground, so this is hardly relegation for the green greens. I did not dig the ground after the garlic was lifted, but simply raked it over and trowelled a hole for each plant, which had been grown in a 3in pot, so that it is a fair-sized plant before the slugs can get at it. I don't believe in no-dig gardening, except as a labour-saving scheme, but brassicas like firm soil so that their roots anchor strongly. It will be interesting to see if this laissez-faire method makes them able to withstand wind better than their purple counterparts in the more pampered vegetable garden. </p> <p>The garlic is a fabulous crop this year. I sowed 'Cledar' in November and 'Printnor' a month later on heavy ground lightened only with mushroom compost. While I do not think of this soil or climate as being good for garlic, I know that it is perfect for parsley and have never failed to have masses of flat-leaf all year round. This year, for a reason I have not yet established, all three sowings of parsley are looking poorly, with orange, feeble leaves and weak root-growth. Although it has been rather dry, I think the cause of this might be a fungal infection. </p> <p>Talking of dry, everything could do with a good soak. We do not water much because we do not have the time or irrigation system, but I always know what things are beginning to suffer when the Acanthus spinosus starts to flop dangerously. But the plant that suffers the most from dry weather is the Gunnera manicata that I planted last spring. I lined its (large) planting hole with an old butyl liner, and added masses of compost to hold moisture, but it only gets wet when the garden floods or when I leave the hose on it. However, it has amazing powers of recovery after a long bath.</p>",

      "body": "<p>'It isn't about filling a bucket; it's about lighting a fire!' So goes the advice given to undergraduate students choosing their subjects at Miami University, Ohio. </p> <p>The advice given to students selecting a degree course on this side of the Atlantic may be less colourful, but it still carries the same message. Universities, careers advisers and employers agree that students should choose a subject they enjoy. </p> <p>Students should ignore advice to go for a subject that promises a job in a sexy part of the economy, such as IT, or one thought to involve watching lots of daytime TV, such as media studies. </p> <p>At the very least studying a subject you find boring is unlikely to lead to academic glory. At most it could mean subjecting yourself to three years of misery. </p> <p>Keith Hicks, communications manager for the University of the West of England, says the university has found it vital for students to study a subject that matches their ambitions. He says that students who who do not are much more likely to drop out. </p> <p>To address this problem the University set up a programme in collaboration with Ucas to produce a profile of individual courses to help students choose. </p> <p>This 'course profile' gives students details about jobs former graduates of the course are doing and the skills the course will require of an individual student. It is meant to be a kind of course CV. Hicks says: 'Those studying more vocational courses such as education, computer studies or media studies tend to be more typecast in the kinds of jobs which they go on to after graduation.' They should therefore be very sure about their ultimate career ambitions. 'Non-vocational courses are better for people wanting to keep their options open.' </p> <p>Carl Gilleard, chief executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters, represents employers who recruit between 20 and 30 thousand graduates each year across all sectors of the economy. In his view it is necessary to look much further than the choice of subject when considering how best to secure a graduate job. He says: 'It's not enough just to go to university and end up with a degree'. Students, he says, 'need to take control of their career and take advantage of opportunities to develop new skills.' </p> <p>Employers are looking for difficult-to-define skills such as the ability to work with colleagues, to express yourself clearly - and the self confidence to follow a job through to completion. Gilleard says that while at university, students should take part-time or voluntary work to build their self-confidence and demonstrate their abilities to future employers. </p> <p>Anne Lindsey, from the Learning and Skills Group of employers' organisation The Confederation of British Industry (CBI), says: 'Students should go to university knowing what they want to get out of their time in terms of personal development and improving their employability.' She believes that employers look for, 'intellectual, communication, interpersonal and specialist knowledge'. All the other skills can be gained from academic study of any subject and, importantly, from experiences beyond the curriculum. </p> <p>Lindsey says students must nowadays, 'think early about how to improve employability and take advantage of the careers services at their university early on in their course'. Already, according to a study by the Department for Education and Employment, 41 per cent of all students now do some form of work experience during their degree. </p> <p>Work experience is often a part of the curriculum in vocational degrees, through 'sandwich courses', where students work for a time in industry during their studies. </p> <p>However the view of the CBI is that all students need to be getting work experience. Even those students studying non-vocational subjects such as English should be looking to improve their mix of skills through extra-curricular activities during their time at university. </p> <p>The requirements of employers are greater than ever, and a student can't meet them any longer simply by doing well in their degree.

      "bodyText": "'It isn't about filling a bucket; it's about lighting a fire!' So goes the advice given to undergraduate students choosing their subjects at Miami University, Ohio. The advice given to students selecting a degree course on this side of the Atlantic may be less colourful, but it still carries the same message. Universities, careers advisers and employers agree that students should choose a subject they enjoy. Students should ignore advice to go for a subject that promises a job in a sexy part of the economy, such as IT, or one thought to involve watching lots of daytime TV, such as media studies. At the very least studying a subject you find boring is unlikely to lead to academic glory. At most it could mean subjecting yourself to three years of misery. Keith Hicks, communications manager for the University of the West of England, says the university has found it vital for students to study a subject that matches their ambitions. He says that students who who do not are much more likely to drop out. To address this problem the University set up a programme in collaboration with Ucas to produce a profile of individual courses to help students choose. This 'course profile' gives students details about jobs former graduates of the course are doing and the skills the course will require of an individual student. It is meant to be a kind of course CV. Hicks says: 'Those studying more vocational courses such as education, computer studies or media studies tend to be more typecast in the kinds of jobs which they go on to after graduation.' They should therefore be very sure about their ultimate career ambitions. 'Non-vocational courses are better for people wanting to keep their options open.' Carl Gilleard, chief executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters, represents employers who recruit between 20 and 30 thousand graduates each year across all sectors of the economy. In his view it is necessary to look much further than the choice of subject when considering how best to secure a graduate job. He says: 'It's not enough just to go to university and end up with a degree'. Students, he says, 'need to take control of their career and take advantage of opportunities to develop new skills.' Employers are looking for difficult-to-define skills such as the ability to work with colleagues, to express yourself clearly - and the self confidence to follow a job through to completion. Gilleard says that while at university, students should take part-time or voluntary work to build their self-confidence and demonstrate their abilities to future employers. Anne Lindsey, from the Learning and Skills Group of employers' organisation The Confederation of British Industry (CBI), says: 'Students should go to university knowing what they want to get out of their time in terms of personal development and improving their employability.' She believes that employers look for, 'intellectual, communication, interpersonal and specialist knowledge'. All the other skills can be gained from academic study of any subject and, importantly, from experiences beyond the curriculum. Lindsey says students must nowadays, 'think early about how to improve employability and take advantage of the careers services at their university early on in their course'. Already, according to a study by the Department for Education and Employment, 41 per cent of all students now do some form of work experience during their degree. Work experience is often a part of the curriculum in vocational degrees, through 'sandwich courses', where students work for a time in industry during their studies. However the view of the CBI is that all students need to be getting work experience. Even those students studying non-vocational subjects such as English should be looking to improve their mix of skills through extra-curricular activities during their time at university. The requirements of employers are greater than ever, and a student can't meet them any longer simply by doing well in their degree. Many graduates, those who did media courses for example, have already found that there are a very limited number of jobs being chased by a large number of graduates. Graduates from non-vocational courses are competing with them for the same jobs. In the media, as in many other areas, getting the perfect job on graduation depends on a lot more than getting on to the right course. The growth in the number of vocational degrees and places available on these courses has continued throughout the Nineties, and shows no sign of ending. There are now more places available to study business as an undergraduate (41,000) does than there are to study physical or biological science (37,000). This growth is partly driven by the appetite of business for more and more graduates qualified in booming sectors such as IT and electrical engineering. It is also a response to the demand from students for new kinds of courses. Among many students there is a misconception that vocational courses offer the best employment opportunities after graduation. However when applying for the majority of graduate jobs the degree subject is irrelevant. What is important to an employer is simply that the candidate has a degree, which demonstrates their sound intellect. Unwelcome as it may sound to those who believe their place on a media studies, or other vocational course, will guarantee them a job, there are plenty of hurdles to clear before the first pay cheque. Conversely, for those who fancied a media studies course and have ended up in clearing, expecting to study English or other traditional courses, the chance of getting that dream job may be better than you thought. The writer of this article studied politics at university, qualified as a lawyer and decided to become a journalist only after working for several years. I dread to think of all the vocational knowledge, which poured into my brain never to be seen again. My advice is not to worry. Remember everyone's fire gets lit eventually. Take your time and work out what it is you really want to do, and then get going.",

      "body": "<p>This is a tense time for students who have just taken their A Levels (or equivalents) - and, indeed, for their parents. Those who have conditional offers for university or other higher education courses know what grades they have to make. Depending on those results, different career paths and lifetime opportunities would appear to open up - or, if the grades aren't good enough, be closed down. </p> <p> But will going to university increase your future earning capacity? Given the considerable financial costs of going through three or more years of higher education, it is well worth looking beyond the immediate hurdle to see whether there are other ways to get what you want out of life and to glean some idea of what you might be earning four or five years out. </p> <p> A survey conducted by the economics department at the University of Warwick looked at the earnings of nearly 45,000 students who graduated in 1993 from traditional universities (not former polytechnics) and went more or less straight into employment. After six months, average earnings for men were \u00a3464 a week, while the average for women graduates was considerably lower, at \u00a3347 a week. This was in line with most earlier research, which showed male graduates earning salaries 17 per cent higher than those of men who did not attend university or did not complete their degrees. The differential for women was even more pronounced, with a 37 per cent premium over non-graduates. </p> <p>But that data goes back to 1993 - before the internet and the 'New Economy' took off. Nor does it include graduates from any of the 'modern' universities. Taking a longer viewpoint, the differential between graduates and non-graduates tends to increase with age. All the research confirms that university graduates do earn more in the long run. Richard Pearson, director of the Brighton-based Institute of Employment Studies (IES), uses a 'rate of return analysis' to show that, on average, graduates earn 60 per cent more over a working life. </p> <p> 'But that,' he notes, 'is historical data based on final salaries before retirement. It's looking back into the twentieth century, not forward to the twentyfirst.' What the Warwick research does underline is that it makes a big difference what kind of degree you get. A first-class degree holder will earn about 12 per cent more than a person who gets a third. It also found considerable differences between subjects studied. At the older universities, law and politics students found jobs paying roughly 20 per cent above average, while those studying the humanities or agriculture were paid well below the median salary. </p> <p> But again, these results are achieved by analysing historical data and extrapolating forward. They are also based on the graduates' first jobs. Those taking time out are not represented, while those who took a temporary and fairly low-paid job before deciding on their career may depress the averages. </p> <p> Yet another approach was applied in a recent study conducted by the Higher Education Career Services Unit (CSU), using data from the Labour Force Survey to see how graduate earnings compared with those of non-graduates. Based on a random sample of British households conducted in 1998, the research shows that, on average, graduates earn over 60 per cent more than non-graduates. The pay gap among the 20-24 age group was 31 per cent; by the late thirties it was 60 per cent; and graduates in their late forties were earning 76 per cent more. It also found that the earnings gap between female graduates and non-graduates was consistently higher than for males. </p> <p> So most significant consideration for those thinking of taking a university degree is not the salary level of their first job after graduating, but what happens thereafter. For their earnings rise much more sharply as their career 'takes off' between the ages of 25 and 35. Above the age of 40 average earnings level out or even drop off - maybe because the older respondents were working fewer hours or taking on different roles. But the graduates tend to 'plateau' at a much higher level and retain their peak earnings later in life. </p> <p> Another CSU report, entitled 'Moving On' tracked the early career paths of people who graduated in 1995, including those from the new universities. Again, the choice of subject was critical, with those qualifying in medicine, maths and computing, engineering and business studies earning more than \u00a320,000, while those who had studied arts or humanities earned on average \u00a317,000 or less. The demand for good graduates has been booming in recent years. The demand is most fierce at the 'high-flyer' end of the spectrum, with big recruiters such as multi-nationals, the City and financial services companies still unable to find what they need. At the IES, Richard Pearson notes: 'Despite their recurrent difficulties, the major recruiters have not markedly raised graduate starting salaries. While last year a few paid in excess of \u00a325,000, many jobs are advertised at \u00a310-12,000. Changes to the median starting salary (\u00a317,500 in 1999) largely track the rise in national earnings'. For those who are certain to get into the university and course of their choice, the answer as to whether it's worth it is straightforward. On average graduates do earn more, and continue to do so throughout their working lives. </p> <p> But that is on average. Different individuals have different skills and aptitudes. The decision is most difficult for those who haven't got on to the course they wanted, or who are unsure whether they'll graduate. The experience of going to university may be worthwhile in itself, but the financial bonuses normally kick in only if you get the qualification. </p> <p> The UK has one of the lowest student drop-out rates in the world. In 1995-6 only 18 per cent did not complete their higher education course; this compares with 28 per cent in Germany, 37 per cent in the US and 66 per cent in Italy. And as for the likelihood of being in a job three years after graduation, 94 per cent of British students manage that, as against 86 per cent of French graduates and 68 per cent in Italy. </p> <p> Work out what the total cost of your degree will be, factor in all the variables, such as dropping out or not finding a job, and then make an estimate of what your lifetime earnings might be. The result would be a basic risk/reward ratio. But the law of averages will always work out that it is worth taking that risk and making the personal investment of taking that university place.</p>",

But nothing stops parents worrying when a child first leaves home and many parents scrape together as much as they can, knowing that students whose life is restricted to study and sleep also waste the experience of university. </p> <p> Parents have already learned that, if your children go to university, it is going to cost you money - around \u00a318,000 for a three-year course outside London, and \u00a322,000 in London. You have to pay at least the means-tested parental contribution but can add however much you want for holidays, travel, sports and a student social life. Further education costs are cheapest if your child attends a university near home because it cuts out rent, food, and coach or train fares back. Most kids ignore the expense and take the opportunity to leave the family nest.</p> <p> Immediately they are tempted to borrow money. The student loan has replaced maintenance grants, and banks readily lend to students. As a result, graduates now leave university more than \u00a35,000, and sometimes \u00a310,000, in debt, which can take years to repay. Add this to your calculations if you want your child to graduate debt-free. </p> <p> Ian Millward, investment marketing manager at financial adviser Chase de Vere, explains the benefit of starting to save for this expense early: 'The first pound in is the most valuable, because it has longer to grow: so the sooner you start saving, the less it will cost.' Not all parents have the chance to start saving ahead of the event: many simply have no money to spare while the children are young. Parents worrying where they are going to find the money for this October have limited options.</p> <p> You can pay out of current income, which is difficult even if you cancel all holidays. Grandparents may help. Or you can make the child work through college. You could sell investments - but please do not sell life insurance policies. If life insurance is your only source of money, try borrowing against the policy but remember that, if you die before repaying the loan, the debt is deducted from the payout to your dependants. You can borrow from other sources. Overdrafts are a bad idea because they are not intended for long-term debt. Personal loans are possible but expensive. Instead, negotiate with your mortgage provider, or find one that has remortgage scheme, allowing you to use the equity in your home. As a last resort, you could move to a cheaper property. </p> <p> An increasingly popular idea is buying a house for the student to live in. Not only does this avoid paying rent, but the student earns money from taking in lodgers. The property market has gone off the boil recently, so you may not make a capital gain after three years - but you could continue renting to other students. You face capital gains tax if you do make a profit when you sell. </p> <p> For parents who are planning ahead, saving for university fees is the same as saving for any event happening on a known date. You can earmark a lump sum if you have money to spare, or you can start a regular savings scheme. You choose the type that is most appropriate to the length of time left before you will need the money. And the less time there is, the less risk you should take. When there is less than five years to go, keep your savings safe, in a bank or building society deposit account, mini cash Isa or National Savings product. Look for the highest rate of interest. </p> <p> If you have 10 years in hand, you should go for safe unit trusts or investment trusts. You can hold these in your own name, or designate the investment with your child's name so the money is taxed as the child's and not yours. Unless children have investments or earnings totalling more than the personal tax allowance (\u00a34,385 this year), you can avoid tax. </p> <p> But choose funds that concentrate on capital growth rather than income because, once the income on money you give your child exceeds \u00a3100 a year, the Inland Revenue taxes it as yours again. Zero-dividend preference shares, a type of investment trust, are a possibil ity according to Millward: 'Zeros produce a set amount on a set date, but finding zeros to match what you are looking to do is not always easy.' You can put the investment in an Isa in your own name to avoid tax. </p> <p> Parents with plenty of time can put money into riskier unit trusts or investment trusts, although you should still keep some money in a comparatively safe investment. 'Time is on your side, so you can take more chances, which should give you better returns, which should mean you need to save less,' says Millward. </p> <p> Friendly society savings plans are tax-free and take a maximum \u00a325 a month. You are locked in for 10 years, but it is a relatively small premium. Be wary of wrap-up school-fee and university schemes. Millward warns: 'They tend to be just wrapped around a series of endowments that run at different maturity dates. They are normal lump-sum investments, as you might buy for a retirement or wedding, that someone has chosen to badge for university fees. With any endowment, you are locked in - and they are inflexible.'</p>",

Grandparents may help. Or you can make the child work through college. You could sell investments - but please do not sell life insurance policies. If life insurance is your only source of money, try borrowing against the policy but remember that, if you die before repaying the loan, the debt is deducted from the payout to your dependants. You can borrow from other sources. Overdrafts are a bad idea because they are not intended for long-term debt. Personal loans are possible but expensive. Instead, negotiate with your mortgage provider, or find one that has remortgage scheme, allowing you to use the equity in your home. As a last resort, you could move to a cheaper property. An increasingly popular idea is buying a house for the student to live in. Not only does this avoid paying rent, but the student earns money from taking in lodgers. The property market has gone off the boil recently, so you may not make a capital gain after three years - but you could continue renting to other students. You face capital gains tax if you do make a profit when you sell. For parents who are planning ahead, saving for university fees is the same as saving for any event happening on a known date. You can earmark a lump sum if you have money to spare, or you can start a regular savings scheme. You choose the type that is most appropriate to the length of time left before you will need the money. And the less time there is, the less risk you should take. When there is less than five years to go, keep your savings safe, in a bank or building society deposit account, mini cash Isa or National Savings product. Look for the highest rate of interest. If you have 10 years in hand, you should go for safe unit trusts or investment trusts. You can hold these in your own name, or designate the investment with your child's name so the money is taxed as the child's and not yours. Unless children have investments or earnings totalling more than the personal tax allowance (\u00a34,385 this year), you can avoid tax. But choose funds that concentrate on capital growth rather than income because, once the income on money you give your child exceeds \u00a3100 a year, the Inland Revenue taxes it as yours again. Zero-dividend preference shares, a type of investment trust, are a possibil ity according to Millward: 'Zeros produce a set amount on a set date, but finding zeros to match what you are looking to do is not always easy.' You can put the investment in an Isa in your own name to avoid tax. Parents with plenty of time can put money into riskier unit trusts or investment trusts, although you should still keep some money in a comparatively safe investment. 'Time is on your side, so you can take more chances, which should give you better returns, which should mean you need to save less,' says Millward. Friendly society savings plans are tax-free and take a maximum \u00a325 a month. You are locked in for 10 years, but it is a relatively small premium. Be wary of wrap-up school-fee and university schemes. Millward warns: 'They tend to be just wrapped around a series of endowments that run at different maturity dates. They are normal lump-sum investments, as you might buy for a retirement or wedding, that someone has chosen to badge for university fees. With any endowment, you are locked in - and they are inflexible.'",

The Americans call it 'empty nest syndrome', but the range of feelings a parent feels when their loved one leaves home is no medical condition. </p> <p> 'It's quite natural to feel sad when your children leave home,' says Cheryl Walters, head of policy and research at Parentline Plus, the family support organisation. 'And it's OK for it to be difficult. If you didn't care about them, their leaving wouldn't matter. If someone becomes seriously depressed, of course, that is a medical condition, but I would suggest that person would be predisposed to depression.' </p> <p> US parents Van and Shirley Hughes of Arizona felt the lack of their two sons so deeply that they decided to become foster parents and ended up adopting 10 brothers and sisters. 'Everybody thinks we are crazy, but the pros outweigh the cons,' Shirley says. </p> <p> Although Walters would not necessarily advocate rushing off and having more children, she agrees that some women simply cannot face losing their role of mother. Forty five-year-old 'Sarah', who found herself in this position, says: 'My whole life has revolved around my kids and when they were ready to move out of the house I had a hard time dealing with it. It was like all of a sudden I felt so alone and didn't feel needed anymore. Well that didn't last long. I ended up getting pregnant again and had another baby at 40. </p> <p> 'At the time I thought I was mad for wanting to do it, but after five years now it's been one of the best things that ever happened to me. I cherish her more every day and feel like I have a purpose in life again.' </p> <p> But it is obviously not possible to keep on having babies for ever. Walters says: 'While it is very difficult telling people what they should do, one thing I would say is that it is very important not to live your life entirely through your children. You need to have interests that can be expanded to fill the space left when they leave.' </p> <p> Paradoxically, though, Walters does not believe that stay-at-home mothers necessarily have a harder time adjusting to their children leaving home. 'A mother who doesn't work may feel more aware of the loss faster, but it could also be argued that a working mother will have a job to hold down while at the same time having to deal with some difficult feelings. It is all about adjustment, and how easily you do this will depend more on the type of person you are than on whether you work. Not everyone will experience problems.' </p> <p> Indeed, for some parents their children leaving home can be nothing short of liberating. 'Rachel', who had stayed at home while her children were growing up says: 'I served my role as chauffeur, nurse, teacher, referee, you name it. I have never regretted one day of it. But it was inevitable that one day my children would grow up, and if I did my job the way I was supposed to, they would become responsible adults and leave home. </p> <p> 'I have to admit that the anticipation I used to feel when I thought about them leaving home was far worse than the reality. I have kept myself busy with a fun job, with college courses and doing things I always wanted to do but didn't because I didn't want to feel guilty for taking time away from my kids.' </p> <p> But empty nest syndrome is not just an issue for mothers; fathers suffer too. Playwright Jack Rosenthal became so depressed when his own children left home for university that he sought the help of a counsellor. What he describes as his 'agony of loss' inspired two television plays, Eskimo Days and Cold Enough for Snow. He found parting with each of his three children extremely traumatic. In Cold Enough for Snow, one of the two fathers in the play has a nervous breakdown but finds salvation when his wife (played by Rosenthal's real-life wife Maureen Lipman) persuades him to go back to the local college in Blackburn, where he does a night school course in sports science. But what of the children in all this. It is an exciting but often frightening time of transition for them.Watching their parents going through agonies at the prospect of them leaving is unlikely to be very helpful. 'You never really get rid of your children: a sign of a healthy relationship is where the child can go off without feeling guilty,' says Walters. 'It is very important that you don't put these negative feelings on to the child. A child needs to feel confident that they can go off and be OK and that you'll be OK and that if they have any problems they can come back to you.' </p> <p> And come back they probably will. Students are likely to be at home for about 20 weeks of the year. And once you have started to adjust to the fact that they have left, you then have to readjust to them coming back. Lucy Selleck, a Relate counsellor and mother of undergraduates, says that can prove just as difficult, not just on the parent-child relationship but also the relationship between the parents. 'Maybe as a couple you start to come closer again. You adjust to your nice new life - going out, supper parties - then back the kids come in the holidays or at weekends. It can be difficult: everyone wants to be nice to each other but it may be hard. </p> <p> 'People often feel they are alone in dreading these returns home, but the adjustments don't end with the child going away and you recovering from the trauma. When your children come back they often regress. They come back to mummy and daddy very ambivalent. Half of them wants to be looked after, and the other half feels overmothered and overparented.' </p> <p> But if you recognise this situation, do not despair. Selleck says that parents as well as children grow up during this period, and both start to recognise each other's space - no more rows over the use of the kitchen. 'It is good if you all recognise boundaries. Children can't treat their homes like a student house, and you must remember that the family house is also still their home. Also, as parents, it is most important to remember that you are a team - kids are very good at splitting you.' </p> <p> This is one of the reasons why this time of adjustment can also put a strain on a marriage. Relate sees many couples for whom the empty nest has played a part in bringing problems to a head. 'If a relationship has not got good basic foundations, it can be sorely tested. Couples may look at each other and wonder what's still there,' says Selleck. But children leaving home, whether to go to university, to get married, or just to lead an independent life is also just a part of the natural order of things - one of those rites of passage where parents must learn to let go.</p> <p> Selleck's advice to parents is reassuring: <br> <strong> 1.</strong> Be aware that your child leaving home for college is a transition period. Year one can be difficult and it can take time for all of you to adjust. Don't panic.<br> <strong> 2. </strong>Don't rush into things yourself. It is very tempting to fill up every minute of your day. You need time to think as an individual and as a couple. Don't do anything drastic. <br> <strong> 3. </strong>Take the time to work on your relationship as a couple. Don't give up on it. <br></p> <p> \u0095 Parentline Plus helpline: 0808 800 2222 Relate: 01788 573241</p>",

This is one of the reasons why this time of adjustment can also put a strain on a marriage. Relate sees many couples for whom the empty nest has played a part in bringing problems to a head. 'If a relationship has not got good basic foundations, it can be sorely tested. Couples may look at each other and wonder what's still there,' says Selleck. But children leaving home, whether to go to university, to get married, or just to lead an independent life is also just a part of the natural order of things - one of those rites of passage where parents must learn to let go. Selleck's advice to parents is reassuring: 1. Be aware that your child leaving home for college is a transition period. Year one can be difficult and it can take time for all of you to adjust. Don't panic. 2. Don't rush into things yourself. It is very tempting to fill up every minute of your day. You need time to think as an individual and as a couple. Don't do anything drastic. 3. Take the time to work on your relationship as a couple. Don't give up on it. \u0095 Parentline Plus helpline: 0808 800 2222 Relate: 01788 573241",

      "body": "<p>UK carmakers and components suppliers were warned this weekend by a leading industry expert that they must learn to live with the high pound. </p> <p>But the Government was given notice by the expert, academic Nick Matthews, that the euro will eventually become the global currency of the motor industry, and that manufacturers will continue to suffer real financial pain as long as Britain fails to commit itself to the single currency. </p> <p>The warnings came after Toyota, which builds cars in Derbyshire and engines in north Wales, last week put further pressure on the Government to join the euro by demanding that suppliers of components sign all contracts for future new business in euros. </p> <p>This was the latest call in a catalogue of protests this summer from virtually all the companies building cars in the UK: the high value of the pound against the euro is, they insist, threatening existing factories as well as future investment in Britain. </p> <p>Toyota's announcement followed a meeting between Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn and Tony Blair at the end of last month at which the Prime Minister was warned that the Nissan plant in Sunderland did not have a future if currency imbalances meant it was not awarded the contract later this year to build the next Micra model. </p> <p>The Government has so far steadfastly refused to bend to the manufacturers' appeals either to join the euro or to commit itself unequivocally to joining, in order to encourage the pound and the euro to move closer in value. </p> <p>Matthews, senior fellow at Warwick University's international manufacturing group, said that rather than relying on the Government, carmakers and suppliers would have to 'get used' to the industry costing in euros and adapt to the environment in order to survive. </p> <p>'The aerospace industry costs in US dollars the world over, whether trading parts or whole aircraft, because the planemakers work in dollars and because North America is the leading marketplace,' he said. </p> <p>'What is happening with the motor industry is that Europe is the world's single biggest car market, and the euro is becoming the currency of the auto business.' </p> <p>European motorists buy around 16 million cars a year, ahead of North America with 12 million and the Far East with 10 million. </p> <p>Matthews said: 'It does not matter whether you currently operate with pounds, yen or dollars: the future for the industry is the euro. Everyone outside the eurozone, including the UK and places like Norway, Poland and the Czech Republic over time will be forced to cost components in euros as the norm.' </p> <p>Smaller UK component suppliers have most to lose from the large manufacturers demanding to pay in euros, as they are least flexible and all their staff and materials costs are in sterling. </p> <p>The motor industry is consolidating, with an increasing number of tie-ups between US, European and Asian manufacturers. International barriers are being broken down and companies are increasingly buying parts wherever in Europe they can get the best price, rather than remaining loyal to local suppliers. </p> <p>The carmakers will benefit from buying in the eurozone, or paying UK suppliers in euros. But British car factories are still at a disadvantage in terms of selling their cars in the UK in competition with cheaper imports, as well as trying to make profits when exporting into the eurozone. </p> <p>British car factories are less cost-effective than many of their continental counterparts because their tooling and equipment are outdated, often because of under-investment. Nissan's Sunderland plant - now more than 10 years old - is heading the same way.

      "bodyText": "UK carmakers and components suppliers were warned this weekend by a leading industry expert that they must learn to live with the high pound. But the Government was given notice by the expert, academic Nick Matthews, that the euro will eventually become the global currency of the motor industry, and that manufacturers will continue to suffer real financial pain as long as Britain fails to commit itself to the single currency. The warnings came after Toyota, which builds cars in Derbyshire and engines in north Wales, last week put further pressure on the Government to join the euro by demanding that suppliers of components sign all contracts for future new business in euros. This was the latest call in a catalogue of protests this summer from virtually all the companies building cars in the UK: the high value of the pound against the euro is, they insist, threatening existing factories as well as future investment in Britain. Toyota's announcement followed a meeting between Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn and Tony Blair at the end of last month at which the Prime Minister was warned that the Nissan plant in Sunderland did not have a future if currency imbalances meant it was not awarded the contract later this year to build the next Micra model. The Government has so far steadfastly refused to bend to the manufacturers' appeals either to join the euro or to commit itself unequivocally to joining, in order to encourage the pound and the euro to move closer in value. Matthews, senior fellow at Warwick University's international manufacturing group, said that rather than relying on the Government, carmakers and suppliers would have to 'get used' to the industry costing in euros and adapt to the environment in order to survive. 'The aerospace industry costs in US dollars the world over, whether trading parts or whole aircraft, because the planemakers work in dollars and because North America is the leading marketplace,' he said. 'What is happening with the motor industry is that Europe is the world's single biggest car market, and the euro is becoming the currency of the auto business.' European motorists buy around 16 million cars a year, ahead of North America with 12 million and the Far East with 10 million. Matthews said: 'It does not matter whether you currently operate with pounds, yen or dollars: the future for the industry is the euro. Everyone outside the eurozone, including the UK and places like Norway, Poland and the Czech Republic over time will be forced to cost components in euros as the norm.' Smaller UK component suppliers have most to lose from the large manufacturers demanding to pay in euros, as they are least flexible and all their staff and materials costs are in sterling. The motor industry is consolidating, with an increasing number of tie-ups between US, European and Asian manufacturers. International barriers are being broken down and companies are increasingly buying parts wherever in Europe they can get the best price, rather than remaining loyal to local suppliers. The carmakers will benefit from buying in the eurozone, or paying UK suppliers in euros. But British car factories are still at a disadvantage in terms of selling their cars in the UK in competition with cheaper imports, as well as trying to make profits when exporting into the eurozone. British car factories are less cost-effective than many of their continental counterparts because their tooling and equipment are outdated, often because of under-investment. Nissan's Sunderland plant - now more than 10 years old - is heading the same way. This means the plants cannot produce the huge variety of models that firms want to make from a single, expensive platform. This problem contributed to Rover's near-collapse, and to Ford's decision to stop making cars at Dagenham. This exacerbates the problem of Britain becoming a less attractive place for foreign-owned carmakers to invest. Meanwhile, Mark Schennum, vice-president at Gemini Consulting, said the UK government seemed to be 'letting the market' bring the value of sterling nearer to the euro. 'If your suppliers bill in euros, it puts downward pressure on the pound anyway,' he said. It would be 'political suicide' for the Government to join the euro now, because public opinion was firmly against it. Schennum said UK carmakers were 'undoubtedly hurting', but the Government needed to consider seriously whether the manufacturers could adjust successfully to the currency situation. He felt that their protests were part of a backlash against the Government's ruling that the price of new cars in Britain must be slashed. He added: 'Britain is still getting more than its fair share of inward investment from around the world compared with the rest of Europe.'",

Unfortunately, instead of saying la droite (the political Right), he said le droit (the law). Before he could correct himself, Sartre had taken off on an unstoppable spiel, beginning with the assertion that 'the law is theatre' and going on to show that 'the characters of Sophocles, of Euripides, even of Aeschylus - they are all lawyers' and that 'the stage is the courtroom'. </p> <p>When Tynan returned to the matter in hand, asking Sartre if 'an author of extreme right-wing views could ever succeed in creating a work of art', he received a plain answer 'in my opinion, no'. According to Sartre, as the Right no longer understood how the world functions 'one can't imagine a modern play that could be at the same time right-wing and good'. </p> <p>I thought of this exchange while watching William Friedkin's Rules of Engagement because as a courtroom drama it fulfils in the most literal way Sartre's definition of what constitutes theatre and also because it's arguably right-wing and unarguably pretty bad, though not without entertaining moments, mostly connected with the central performances. </p> <p>There have always been two streams of Hollywood movies about the armed forces - those made with the assistance of the army, navy or air force, which have constituted the majority, and those which have not sought, or have been denied, official assistance.</p> <p>Rules of Engagement belongs very clearly in the former category, as a somewhat extreme apologia for military conduct and thinking. It begins in the swamps of Vietnam in 1968 where a young black lieutenant, Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson), saves the life of a fellow officer, Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), by committing a war crime. To compel a North Vietnamese colonel to call off his men bent on killing Hodges's isolated section, Childers murders a Vietcong prisoner-of-war in cold blood. This is what happens in battle, the film implies, and only a civilian would think it improper. </p> <p>The film cuts to 29 years later when both men are US marine colonels, one divorced, the other married to the corps. Hodges, a military lawyer of no great distinction (he's been behind a desk since being crippled in Nam), is on the point of retirement; Childers is on active service in the Indian Ocean. </p> <p>When a mob of Islamic fundamentalists threatens the American embassy in Yemen, Childers takes a platoon of Marines to the rescue, saving the ambassador and his family, but ordering his men to fire on the mob, whom he sees as an armed threat to his men, and 83 civilians are killed and more than 100 wounded. As a result he returns home not to a hero's welcome, but to a court martial with the possibility of receiving a death sentence. Improbably, he asks his old chum Hodges to defend him, rather than engaging a hot-shot civilian. </p> <p>Credit for the story goes to the film's executive producer, James Webb, who served as a marine officer in Vietnam before working as a lawyer, writer on military affairs and US Secretary of the Navy under Reagan. The screenplay, however, is by a television writer, Stephen Gaghan, and it is presumably he who has larded it with every clich\u00e9 in the book from the retired lawyer out fly-fishing when he's called back to the fray to the ridiculous bonding fight between old chums that ends in black eyes, bloody noses and laughter. </p> <p>There are the usual surprise witnesses, of course, as well as vital bits of evidence that suddenly turn up, though these are all acceptable aspects of the courtroom genre. More significantly, however, the audience is given nothing to ponder, evaluate, think about. We should be in the position of the seven marine majors who make up the jury. Instead, we're made privy to vital information that would not merely have been useful for the defence but would have prevented Childers from being indicted in the first place. </p> <p>The villains of the piece (worse than the Yemeni mob whom the movie views as so many towelheads) are a suave National Security Adviser (Bruce Greenwood), with a portrait of Jack Kennedy, on his wall and a cowardly US ambassador (Ben Kingsley), with a throbbing vein in his temple. </p> <p>But we aren't invited to assess their credibility as witnesses. We've already seen the ambassador act in a craven fashion in Yemen so we know he's a gross perjurer when he accuses Childers of losing his cool and enforcing the evacuation. </p> <p>We also see the Security Adviser, who's looking for a scapegoat to appease Middle- Eastern opinion, destroy a video from the embassy's CCTV surveillance camera that shows (rather unlikely this) that every man, woman and child in the mob had a concealed automatic weapon and fired on the Marines. This pair are contrasted with a newly discovered good guy, the Vietnamese colonel Childers had captured in the jungle 30 years earlier, and who now salutes his old adversary. </p> <p>Seeing this movie after the Republican Convention in Philadelphia is an unnerving experience.

      "body": "<p>In an address given to an aptly awful audience of venture capitalists a few months ago, Tony Blair adopted the modish confessional style and told the world that his struggle to manage the public sector had left 'scars on my back'. The National Health Service was not a home for the many under-resourced and over-worked people who run the most efficient medical service in the developed world, but a swamp of vested interests. Nurses, doctors and cleaners were the \u00e9lite forces of conservatism. The Prime Minister was their proletarian victim. Only the unreliable protection of an enormous Parliamentary majority and a Cabinet which will let him do anything he wants, prevented a martyrdom to rival Saint Di's. </p> <p>After his performance, no one had the right to be surprised when he announced that henceforth the NHS would buy operations from private hospitals. A 'concordat' had been reached with corporate medicine. 'I have always made clear that it is not a question of ideology,' he said in July when asked if further treaties were likely. </p> <p>Admittedly, this particular policy without ideology was the wheeze of New Labour's most influential think tank - the Conservative Party, which once was considered to be an ideologically motivated organisation. But all Third Wayers of good will and sound judgment could be relied upon to forget intellectual origins in this instance and agree that it is nothing more than plain common sense to cut waiting lists by snapping up private services. Who wouldn't prefer to be treated on demand by suddenly deferential consultants in a room of one's own, luxuriously appointed with pot plants the size of triffids, soft carpets and cable television? How many Observer readers have forgotten their loud defences of the NHS when worrying pains afflict them or their loved ones and gone private? What matters is what works. Only a weirdo and probable paedophile would sacrifice the health of a child on the alter of an exhausted ideology. The private sector delivers. </p> <p>It can deliver your child at the Portland Hospital, where Sarah Ferguson, Patsy Kensit, and Posh Spice were relieved of various sprogs. Those with other requirements can be sent to the Harley Street, Princess Grace or Wellington hospitals in central London. All four were brought by a company called HCA on 19 May. The US health conglomerate, which used to be called Columbia/HCA, but was forced to dance the old Windscale-Sellafield name shuffle for reasons we'll get to in a moment, added the Devonshire, Lister and London Bridge hospitals to its portfolio in June.

      "bodyText": "In an address given to an aptly awful audience of venture capitalists a few months ago, Tony Blair adopted the modish confessional style and told the world that his struggle to manage the public sector had left 'scars on my back'. The National Health Service was not a home for the many under-resourced and over-worked people who run the most efficient medical service in the developed world, but a swamp of vested interests. Nurses, doctors and cleaners were the \u00e9lite forces of conservatism. The Prime Minister was their proletarian victim. Only the unreliable protection of an enormous Parliamentary majority and a Cabinet which will let him do anything he wants, prevented a martyrdom to rival Saint Di's. After his performance, no one had the right to be surprised when he announced that henceforth the NHS would buy operations from private hospitals. A 'concordat' had been reached with corporate medicine. 'I have always made clear that it is not a question of ideology,' he said in July when asked if further treaties were likely. Admittedly, this particular policy without ideology was the wheeze of New Labour's most influential think tank - the Conservative Party, which once was considered to be an ideologically motivated organisation. But all Third Wayers of good will and sound judgment could be relied upon to forget intellectual origins in this instance and agree that it is nothing more than plain common sense to cut waiting lists by snapping up private services. Who wouldn't prefer to be treated on demand by suddenly deferential consultants in a room of one's own, luxuriously appointed with pot plants the size of triffids, soft carpets and cable television? How many Observer readers have forgotten their loud defences of the NHS when worrying pains afflict them or their loved ones and gone private? What matters is what works. Only a weirdo and probable paedophile would sacrifice the health of a child on the alter of an exhausted ideology. The private sector delivers. It can deliver your child at the Portland Hospital, where Sarah Ferguson, Patsy Kensit, and Posh Spice were relieved of various sprogs. Those with other requirements can be sent to the Harley Street, Princess Grace or Wellington hospitals in central London. All four were brought by a company called HCA on 19 May. The US health conglomerate, which used to be called Columbia/HCA, but was forced to dance the old Windscale-Sellafield name shuffle for reasons we'll get to in a moment, added the Devonshire, Lister and London Bridge hospitals to its portfolio in June. The company intends to nab 'new facilities in markets outside the London area' as soon as possible. Commercial rivals at the London Heart Hospital are so worried by the Americans' predatory intent they are trying to excite a media campaign to persuade the Department of Trade and Industry to stop HCA creating a private monopoly in London.

'Considering we still have a few out, I was pleased with the performance against a team who are many people's favourites this season,' he said. </p> <p>His squad are also to be strengthened by the arrival of Birmingham's Paul Furlong in a three-month loan deal which was confirmed yesterday.</p>",

The visitors always looked the more likely to score, but their best opportunities in the first half fell to midfielder Martin Grainger, who was twice foiled by good saves from Lee Harper. With Rangers debutant Clarke Carlisle impressive in the home defence, the closest the game came to a goal was five minutes after the interval, when Ndlovu thought he had scored from Grainger's corner only for Gavin Peacock to head out from under his own bar. Rangers almost found a goalscorer in the unlikely form of debutant Peter Crouch. Unlikely because the matchstick physique of Gerry Francis's summer capture from Spurs makes him look even taller than his stated 6ft 6in. Unfortunately, although he won more aerial battles in the second half than the first, heading does not appear to be his strong suit. Crouch was on his own in front of goal when Peacock crossed from the right after an hour, but he could only head weakly over Ian Bennet's bar. But Gerry Francis was pleased enough with his QPR side's performance. 'Considering we still have a few out, I was pleased with the performance against a team who are many people's favourites this season,' he said. His squad are also to be strengthened by the arrival of Birmingham's Paul Furlong in a three-month loan deal which was confirmed yesterday.",
