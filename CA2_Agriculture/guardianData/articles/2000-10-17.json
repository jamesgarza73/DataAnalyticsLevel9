      "body": "<p>There seems to be an unwritten rule among Brazilian musicians at the moment, that staging and showmanship need to be larger than the music. Marisa Monte has pushed the boat out. The set for her sell-out show was so extravagantly camp that it would have upstaged her had she not outmanoeuvred it with her charisma, panache and musicianship. </p> <p>Large gauzes, stretched across and anchored to the stage, loomed like huge splodges of chewing gum, but served as projection screens for moving image projections. Video pictures swirled across them as Monte, wrapped in a black gothic dress with huge red roses stitched to her breast and crowned with an outsize and even blacker wig piece, sashayed onto the stage to Serge Gainsbourg's Je T'aime. </p> <p>Monte, an energetic yet sensitive singer, has been f ted outside of Brazil and embraced by some of the New York art musician set.

      "bodyText": "There seems to be an unwritten rule among Brazilian musicians at the moment, that staging and showmanship need to be larger than the music. Marisa Monte has pushed the boat out. The set for her sell-out show was so extravagantly camp that it would have upstaged her had she not outmanoeuvred it with her charisma, panache and musicianship. Large gauzes, stretched across and anchored to the stage, loomed like huge splodges of chewing gum, but served as projection screens for moving image projections. Video pictures swirled across them as Monte, wrapped in a black gothic dress with huge red roses stitched to her breast and crowned with an outsize and even blacker wig piece, sashayed onto the stage to Serge Gainsbourg's Je T'aime. Monte, an energetic yet sensitive singer, has been f ted outside of Brazil and embraced by some of the New York art musician set. She has also worked with the Brazilian greats, including Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso. She has a fantastic voice. She struck up her nine-piece band - which included a four-strong percussion team that confidently rippled complex rhythms across the stage - to open the show with Amor I Love You, the first track on her most recent album, Memories Chronicles and Declarations of Love. The album formed the backbone of the performance, which seemed to prove another rule - that given some electric guitars and the chance to rock out, a Brazilian band simply can't resist.

But Hollingsworth is just as fascinated by light. His Electric Chair, a neon structure, is a thing of horrible beauty, with its fly-killing, Death Row references, while two video works, 6-0-1 Bike Wheel and The Language of Signs, show the artist in playful form during a residency in Japan. </p> <p>In one, he rides round and round in a park at night, a neon tube attached to his bike. He moves in and out of the frame, powering the light with his pedalling, the circular motion and reddish glow suggesting a heartbeat. It is an oddly comforting work, hypnotically so in fact. </p> <p>The second work is funnier, madder. He pushes the wheel of a bike round city streets, again with neon embellishments - but again there is a warm charm to the result. A wobbly handheld camera filming at shin level gives the video a childlike quality in keeping with the childishness of the game he has entered into. </p> <p>Altogether more grown up is his exploration of existentialism, with a nod to Camus's Myth of Sisyphus. Well, the reference is grown-up, but the result - crushing a Vauxhall Astra in to a white ball - is in keeping with the general air of playful profundity. The ball rocks softly from side to side, as if there might be someone within. Hollingsworth quotes Camus: \"There is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labour.\" The results of futile labour on show here couldn't be less like a punishment. </p> <p>Heyer, by contrast, is less engaging, cooler in the chilly sense of the word. A table of lemon geraniums is the only sign of life, \"a living equivalent of the time-lapse film\" is how the explanatory leaflet puts it, a bit carried away with itself. More affecting is a miniature greenhouse, echoing the gallery's own form. Devoid of function, it makes you think of Crystal Palace, or fragile structures like piers, and how they are held together. </p> <p>The artist takes up this concern again, by placing a series of reversed half-arches along the gallery walls. A generic architectural form suddenly without context, function - they are emphatically not linking or bridging anything - they are a dramatic interrogation of form and function, and the strongest work in Heyer's show. </p> <p>They make you think, \"why?\" just as Hollingsworth rather more playfully makes you think, \"why not?\" </p> <p> Until November 18 Details: 0131-225 2383.</p>",

It was as if these 250-page loan agreements I was negotiating had to be put in place because of the lack of trust,\" Ms Copisarow said. </p> <p>Her vision is to bring the idea to Britain through a new lending institution known as Street UK. Based in Birmingham, Ms Copisarow and her team hope to issue their first loans next month to small businesses which would otherwise never be able to borrow money. By next year, she hopes to sell shares in Street UK so that shareholders could recoup their investment in a few years. </p> <p>It is six years since Ms Copisarow, who worked at multinational banking groups such as Citicorp, the now reformed MidlandMontagu and JP Morgan, gave up her life as an investment banker. The Oxford-educated 42-year-old took the micro-finance idea to Poland, where she was based after the fall of the Berlin wall. She opened up eastern Europe to international finance. She set up Fundusz Mikro, which has now issued 30,000 loans and opened branches in 33 cities in Poland. </p> <p><strong> Banking for all</strong><br> </p> <p> She hopes to secure backing from government and if she achieves her goal, Big Issue sellers on the streets up and down the country could soon have bank accounts. It is what she sees as the first step along the road to saving and the basis for a sounder financial footing. </p> <p>Street UK is based on micro-credit, devised by Professor Mohammed Yunus who eventually formed what became Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Micro-credit sounds evangelical and all too worthy. It requires mutual trust, and it is based on developing a network of friends to support each other. The more people who apply for loans, the lower their rate of repayments. </p> <p>The catch is that they must guarantee each other's loans. Failure by one in the group requires the others to pay. No more than seven are allowed in each group and loans can be granted to individuals on their own, provided they have three outsiders to act as guarantors. </p> <p>\"What we're trying to tap into is the circle of support people naturally have around themselves and the informal information banks would never get. We know when you choose someone to be in your group you wouldn't dream of having them there if you thought you'd have to pay up or they wouldn't pay for you,\" she said. </p> <p><strong> Higher interest rate</strong><br> </p> <p> The loans will be charged at rates of interest perhaps two percentage points higher than banks charge small businesses. But, as far as Street UK is concerned, this is a small price to pay as the borrowers would be denied credit without its loans, which would be about \u00a32,000 and involve repayments over nine months or so. </p> <p>The alternative might be loans from money lenders, who usually lend money to individuals rather than businesses, or loan sharks, whose rates can reach exorbitant levels. </p> <p>The borrowers are likely to be small businesses, probably sole traders, in local communities, where self support - watching each other's stalls in a street market, for example - is a way of life. \"What we're trying to do is make them highly motivated to repay, making them feel they want to repay because this is an organisation that believes in them,\" she says. </p> <p>To cynics, who might regard Street UK as yet another well intentioned attempt - doomed to failure - to tackle the politically charged issue of financial exclusion, Ms Copisarow reels out statistics. By 1993 in Bangladesh 2m of the world's poorest people had been lent money by Grameen Bank with default rates of only 2%. In her venture in Poland, Ms Copisarow's brainchild now employs 94 people and has lent approximately \u00a330m. </p> <p>Street UK will not hold a banking licence but aims to offer bank accounts through a new arrangement through the Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>Ms Copisarow hopes that 80% of all loans made by Street UK will go to groups of seven or less because it should generate simultaneous, mutual growth. \"The main attraction initially will be the [lower] interest rate of repayment within a large group.

When I come into the office, I'm different from when I'm at home and I'd like my employees to meet the Richard-at-home every now and then. Away weekends are perfect for this, but only as long as you make sure that, come Monday, it's back to work - you have to show that you are in charge of your chameleon nature. As the boss, I'm quite happy to get squiffy with the rest of them, but I have a policy of going to bed by 2am because that's when things start to get messy. If people are rowing drunkenly while you're in bed, it is not your responsibility. My advice is always to deal with these things in the morning. </p> <p> <strong> Alison Parker, 39</strong> - chief executive </p> <p> I went on an away weekend at which an esteemed and rather drunk colleague professed undying love. I didn't see it coming, but he confessed his adoration in front of everyone, which produced much mirth. Luckily, I went on two weeks' holiday straight after, so when I got back, it had all blown over. People regress on away weekends - it's almost like being a student again, where everyone gets drunk at a party and lets themselves go. If anyone did bring the subject up, I'd defend mycolleague, blaming the whisky. Every ensuing year, when the subject of away weekends came up, I'd look across at him but get no reaction. I suspect he didn't remember a thing. </p> <p> <strong> Richard Gough, 55</strong> - financial director </p> <p> One thing I have learnt is that you cannot run an away weekend and participate in it. It's a recipe for disaster because you can't keep colleagues on the straight and narrow while throwing your views into work discussions. The only way to get round it is to employ a trained facilitator to run the thing for you. They then control the group dynamics and get people to focus on the day's objectives and enjoy it. On our last away weekend, we were looking to improve our creative thinking skills and the facilitator came up with some very good interactive schemes. He created debating points, we all sat in booths linked by email and in an hour we'd come up with 600 ideas. </p> <p> <strong> Robert Saunders, 27</strong> IT manager </p> <p> Our company organised a big powwow for the organisation's regional offices. The idea was that we got to know each other and it was all lovey-dovey as we worked together in little teams. Well, the weekend was full of good intentions but nothing came of it. We all tried to communicate with each other for the first month afterwards, but as there was no monitoring by the bosses, things just went back to normal. I think away weekends are like being at school. You've got to relax and be cool. Anyone who's too enthusiastic just gets labelled teacher's pet and people gang up against them. That's why I think they don't really work. No one wants to be seen to be putting in too much effort. </p> <p> <strong> Katie James, 42</strong> - project manager </p> <p> Away weekends are a minefield. Often you're stuck with your colleagues in some hotel in the middle of nowhere and the only recreation on offer is the bar. As a result, it can get a bit intense and people always overdo it.

Stress-management consultant, Judi James, is similarly unimpressed by managers who make an early exit. </p> <p>\"Obviously our bosses should be role models - but to see a person who has landed you with a bulk of work skulk off early to play golf is going to stick in your throat a bit,\" she says. </p> <p>\"The British worker is prepared to put up with a lot if they think everyone else is suffering, but if they get the impression someone else is having an easier ride it doesn't go down well at all.\" </p> <p>Early evenings can quickly become co-opted into the hierarchy of perks. \"For much of the 80s, the more elevated position you kept, the less work you seemed to do,\" says Richard Reeves, director of futures at the Industrial Society. \"Obviously, that's not what we want. But equally we don't want this clocking on, clocking off mentality of strict office hours that was borne out of the days of factory working.

      "trailText": "<p>Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale talks to <strong>Daniel Taylor</strong> about the sense of foreboding hanging over the club's return to Istanbul and tells how he is still haunted by the deaths of two supporters in the city.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Every time Peter Ridsdale's mobile phone rings over the next couple of days, the Leeds United chairman will, he confesses, be consumed by a nauseating sense of foreboding. His heart will skip a beat and a knot will tighten in the pit of his stomach. For tomorrow night his team return to Istanbul for the first time since the tragic events of last April. </p> <p>Six months ago on a muggy night in Istanbul the Leeds chairman was dining beside the Bosphorus, a guest of Galatasaray's directors, when he was interrupted by a phone call. The message left him cold to the bone. </p> <p>Later that night Ridsdale was there when the bodies of Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight were formally identified. When he finally left Taksim hospital, he had to pass through bloodstains in the corridors. The memories, grotesque and vivid, will live with him forever. </p> <p>This morning, as the Leeds squad, management and directors leave for Istanbul once again, this time to face Besiktas in the Champions League Group H, it will be a return that has come sooner than they dared even anticipate. For Ridsdale it will be a gruelling 48 hours. Much as he would like to conceal his anxiety, it is an impossible task. </p> <p>\"It is the one game in my life where I am considering all aspects, the safety, the security, everything,\" he says. \"How will the supporters react? Will we be safe getting there? Will we get through the game? I have never felt like this about a football match before. </p> <p>\"What will happen I don't know. I just hope we can get through and that by the end of the week we're asking ourselves: 'Why did we have any sort of fear?' </p> <p>\"But the memories are very fresh and nothing will ever, ever repair the damage that was done in April. As far as the two families are concerned, there is nothing that can ever change. What happened has damaged their lives forever. </p> <p>\"You can't erase it from your memory and pretend it's like going to Barcelona or Milan. I would be a liar if I said it was a normal game. I just sincerely hope that, when we come to Thursday morning, any misgivings I have now will have been misplaced.\" </p> <p>For all the lingering fears, Ridsdale has found the dialogue with Besiktas \"encouraging\". This, he says, is the chance for a new beginning. </p> <p>\"Football desperately needs to demonstrate that it can take place safely. We all know 99.9 per cent of games are safe, secure and entertaining but the incidents last April set everything back. Wednesday is a chance to correct that.\" </p> <p>Paradoxically, Ridsdale says they are treating it like \"any other game in Europe\". Leeds will not employ their own bodyguards out of concern that it could be seen as provocative. But when has a normal game required 20 police officers for every away fan? </p> <p>What passes for the norm in Turkey has long been unacceptable elsewhere, anyway. Galatasaray's supporters have a squalid reputation and the atmosphere when Leeds arrived at the Ali Sami Yen Stadium for their ill-starred Uefa Cup semi-final was bordering on the poisonous. Everyone has seen the pictures of Turks running their thumbs under their throats to mock the two fatal stabbings. What went largely unreported was the dart that was thrown into Nigel Martyn's goalmouth. </p> <p>Besiktas, too, have their lunatic fringe and Ridsdale's fears will not have been eased by the news that a Turkish youth was stabbed before a recent league game at the 45,000-capacity Inonu stadium. </p> <p>Leeds are still waiting for an apology from Galatasaray but Ridsdale insists he is not bitter. \"To be frank I don't blame them. If something had happened on the day of a game at Leeds we would not wish to be accountable for the actions of individuals we didn't know. So I have no blame, no concern about Galatasaray. I may have done things differently but different cultures do things differently. </p> <p>\"My concern is how to handle the families of Christopher and Kevin. I hope we dealt with that in the most appropriate way. We are still in constant contact with them and this is a game that will hopefully build for the future, without being disrespectful to the past.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Manchester United could be without Andy Cole when they face PSV Eindhoven tomorrow in the Group G Champions League game at Old Trafford. The England striker did not train yesterday but United's other doubts, David Beckham and Gary Neville, have been declared fit. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "Every time Peter Ridsdale's mobile phone rings over the next couple of days, the Leeds United chairman will, he confesses, be consumed by a nauseating sense of foreboding. His heart will skip a beat and a knot will tighten in the pit of his stomach. For tomorrow night his team return to Istanbul for the first time since the tragic events of last April. Six months ago on a muggy night in Istanbul the Leeds chairman was dining beside the Bosphorus, a guest of Galatasaray's directors, when he was interrupted by a phone call. The message left him cold to the bone. Later that night Ridsdale was there when the bodies of Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight were formally identified. When he finally left Taksim hospital, he had to pass through bloodstains in the corridors. The memories, grotesque and vivid, will live with him forever. This morning, as the Leeds squad, management and directors leave for Istanbul once again, this time to face Besiktas in the Champions League Group H, it will be a return that has come sooner than they dared even anticipate. For Ridsdale it will be a gruelling 48 hours. Much as he would like to conceal his anxiety, it is an impossible task. \"It is the one game in my life where I am considering all aspects, the safety, the security, everything,\" he says. \"How will the supporters react? Will we be safe getting there? Will we get through the game? I have never felt like this about a football match before. \"What will happen I don't know. I just hope we can get through and that by the end of the week we're asking ourselves: 'Why did we have any sort of fear?' \"But the memories are very fresh and nothing will ever, ever repair the damage that was done in April. As far as the two families are concerned, there is nothing that can ever change. What happened has damaged their lives forever. \"You can't erase it from your memory and pretend it's like going to Barcelona or Milan. I would be a liar if I said it was a normal game. I just sincerely hope that, when we come to Thursday morning, any misgivings I have now will have been misplaced.\" For all the lingering fears, Ridsdale has found the dialogue with Besiktas \"encouraging\". This, he says, is the chance for a new beginning. \"Football desperately needs to demonstrate that it can take place safely. We all know 99.9 per cent of games are safe, secure and entertaining but the incidents last April set everything back. Wednesday is a chance to correct that.\" Paradoxically, Ridsdale says they are treating it like \"any other game in Europe\". Leeds will not employ their own bodyguards out of concern that it could be seen as provocative. But when has a normal game required 20 police officers for every away fan? What passes for the norm in Turkey has long been unacceptable elsewhere, anyway. Galatasaray's supporters have a squalid reputation and the atmosphere when Leeds arrived at the Ali Sami Yen Stadium for their ill-starred Uefa Cup semi-final was bordering on the poisonous. Everyone has seen the pictures of Turks running their thumbs under their throats to mock the two fatal stabbings. What went largely unreported was the dart that was thrown into Nigel Martyn's goalmouth. Besiktas, too, have their lunatic fringe and Ridsdale's fears will not have been eased by the news that a Turkish youth was stabbed before a recent league game at the 45,000-capacity Inonu stadium. Leeds are still waiting for an apology from Galatasaray but Ridsdale insists he is not bitter. \"To be frank I don't blame them. If something had happened on the day of a game at Leeds we would not wish to be accountable for the actions of individuals we didn't know. So I have no blame, no concern about Galatasaray. I may have done things differently but different cultures do things differently. \"My concern is how to handle the families of Christopher and Kevin. I hope we dealt with that in the most appropriate way. We are still in constant contact with them and this is a game that will hopefully build for the future, without being disrespectful to the past.\" \u0095 Manchester United could be without Andy Cole when they face PSV Eindhoven tomorrow in the Group G Champions League game at Old Trafford. The England striker did not train yesterday but United's other doubts, David Beckham and Gary Neville, have been declared fit. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Subs: Marchegiani, Lopez, Crespo, Favalli, Couto, Lombardo, Baronio. <br> <strong>Arsenal :</strong> 24-John Lukic; 2-Lee Dixon, 5-Martin Keown (Captain), 22-Oleg Luzhny, 16-Silvinho; 15-Ray Parlour, 4-Patrick Vieira, 18-Gilles Grimandi, 8-Fredrik Ljungberg; 25-Nwankwo Kanu, 14-Thierry Henry. Subs: Taylor, Adams, Pires, Wiltord, Lauren, Vivas, Cole. <br> <strong>Referee :</strong> Hellmut Krug (Germany) <br> <strong>1</strong> Lazio kick-off on a rain-soaked night in Rome's Olympic Stadium. <br> <strong>2</strong> Nedved creates some space for himself. His looping shot richets out for a corner. Lucic, who tonight becomes the oldest player to appear in the Champions League, does well to block the subsequent cross.<br> <strong>4 </strong> Grimandi and then Luzhney out-grapple fiesty attacking runs from Inzaghi and Salas. <br> <strong>6</strong> Ljunburg pokes the ball down the left flank. But before he can cause any mither, the bald Swede is body-checked by Nesta. Free-kick. <br> <strong>7</strong> Grimandi loses his marker at the near post to dispatch a firm header just wide of the mark. <br> <strong>8</strong> Arsenal enjoy their first spell of possession. The ball is knocked into the galloping Grimandi who directs a well-struck drive straight into the keeper's arms.<br> <strong>11 </strong> Henry shimmies and skins Nesta, who then drags him back to concede a foul. The resulting free-kick is wasted. <br> <strong>12 </strong> A moment of hesitation between Keown and Luzhney allows Nedved to put the willies up Lucic. However, his cross/shot across the goal fails to be met by any of his teammates. <br> <strong>15</strong> The match livens up after early jousting. Viera and Veron vie for midfield supremecy. <br> <strong>18</strong> Much to annoyance of Lazio's notoriously demanding home support, Arsenal begin to boss the tempo of the game. But with one deft touch, Veron demonstrates his capacity to change a game in an instant. <br> <strong>21 </strong> Arsenal continue piling on the pressure with Kanu getting his groove on, Henry cruising into wide spaces and Silvinho threatening to run in on goal from the left wing. <br> <strong>24 GOAL!</strong> Fluke. Salas and Inzaghi bobble the ball to each other unconvincingly outside the Arsenal penalty area. A misdirected pass to Nedved invites a challenge from Silvinho. Somehow the ball balloons up and over the stranded Lucic. A red-faced Nedved claims the goal, but his was not the decisive touch. <br> <strong>29 </strong> Kanu seems determined to break his duck. He might be trying a bit too hard.<br> <strong>34 </strong> Good spell of pressure from Arsenal. Both teams invest much effort in getting an early cross into the box. Yet both teams are getting defenders back in numbers. <br> <strong>35</strong> Off on one of his trademark teasing runs down the left, Silvinho cuts inside and swerves past two Lazio defenders. The young Brazillian finds himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper. But his delicate chip is smoothered by the flailing limbs of Peruzzi. <br> <strong>39</strong> Parlour skips into space, deep inside the Lazio half. But 'ginger locks' fires into deep space. <br> <strong>41</strong>Lazio are awarded a free-kick on the right side of the penalty area. Lucic does very well to bat away Mihajlovic's unholy curler . <br> <strong>43 BOOKING.</strong> Big Ron says: \"Freddie must be fuming!\" Attempting to see out a stray forward pass, Nesta uses his body to shield the attentions of Ljungberg . But, fearing he may lose the ball to the determined Swede, the Italian resorts to sly fakery - voluntarily falling over and winning a free-kick. Ljungberg earns a caution for protesting his innocence. Half-time.<br> <strong>46 SUBSTITUTION.</strong> Claudio Lopez on for Dejan Stankovic. <br> <strong>46</strong> Inzaghi finds himself in acres. But his clips the ball well-wide to the relief of the ageing stand-in goaly.<br> <strong>48</strong> Nedved and Ljungberg almost tear off each others clothes as they battle for the ball. The Lazio hero wins a corner. Lucic does well to get a fist to the inswinging cross. <br> <strong>50</strong> The game opens up with chances at either end. Yet as Arsenal chase the equaliser and throw men forward they looking increasingly susceptible to the premier poaching abilities of Lopez, Salas, Inzaghi et all.<br> <strong>53</strong> The arrival of Lopez gives Lazio much better delivery from the left. <br> <strong>54 FIGHT!</strong> The match descends into a ugly brawl. Simeone looks mighty irrate as blood spurts from a gash by his eye. The slow motion replay reveals that Grimandi planted a right hook into the Argentinean's mush. After much pushing and shoving, Nesta finally gets a yellow card that has been a long time coming. <br> <strong>56</strong> Simeone, who went off to bandage up his wound, returns to the field in a vengeful state of consciousness. Grimandi better watch his back. Maybe his bravery has been bouyed by the presence of big John in goal. <br> <strong>58 </strong> Arsenal's players seemed to have been unnerved by Simeone's aggresive antics. <br> <strong>63</strong> The game returns to the open attacking pattern it assumed early in the second half. <br> <strong>65</strong> Big Ron asks : \"This Veron is supposed to be one of the best players in the world... where is he?\" Indeed. <br> <strong>68 SUSTITUTION.</strong> Crespo- the world's second most expensive striker- comes on for Inzaghi. <br> <strong>69 SUBSTITUTION.</strong> Lauren on for Grimandi ; cock of the Gunners chickens out. <br> <strong>70</strong> Lazio win a series of corners. Up steps the hit-and-miss Mihajlovic. His first corner swings in, bang on target. A spooked Arsenal defence scrambles the ball away. His second almost hits the opposite corner flag. <br> <strong>71</strong> Lazio get the ball into the net after a neat exchange of passes between Crespo and Salas. But the ref rightly calls it offside. <br> <strong>74 SUBSTITUTION.</strong> Wiltord on for Ljungberg <br> <strong>76</strong> Lauren makes his first meaningful contribution to Arsenal's campaign with a meaningless cross. <br> <strong>78</strong> Big Ron declares : \"The game is calling for a little bit of devil from an Arsenal man.\" Nobody does it better than that jeweled man with the fake tan.<br> <strong>80</strong> That Luzhney has looked impressively nimble, covering for the tiring Tony Adams.<br> <strong>82</strong> Kanu finds himself with the goal at his mercy. His shot is blocked. The big Nigerian recovers the ball but flicks it into his own face before being tackled. At times he personifies grace. At times, he displays Wanchope-esque clumsiness <br> <strong>87 GOAL!</strong> Wiltord gets hold of the ball after Arsenal defend a corner. The Frenchman does extremely well to spot the break-neck run of Pires down the right wing and make space for himself to deliver an inch-perfect pass to his compatriot. Pires collects the ball in his stride, balances himself and unleashes a storming right-footed scoop into the top corner.<br> <strong>90</strong> A last minute fright for Arsenal. Somehow Keown conspires to fumble the ball into his own goal. But luckily, the ref spots an earlier infringement and disallows the goal.<br> <strong>93</strong> Full-time. <br> <strong>94</strong>Grimandi and Nesta exchange a bit of afters. <br> <strong>95</strong> The Arsenal players applaud their supporters following a well-earned away draw.</p>",

Subs: Marchegiani, Lopez, Crespo, Favalli, Couto, Lombardo, Baronio. Arsenal : 24-John Lukic; 2-Lee Dixon, 5-Martin Keown (Captain), 22-Oleg Luzhny, 16-Silvinho; 15-Ray Parlour, 4-Patrick Vieira, 18-Gilles Grimandi, 8-Fredrik Ljungberg; 25-Nwankwo Kanu, 14-Thierry Henry. Subs: Taylor, Adams, Pires, Wiltord, Lauren, Vivas, Cole. Referee : Hellmut Krug (Germany) 1 Lazio kick-off on a rain-soaked night in Rome's Olympic Stadium. 2 Nedved creates some space for himself. His looping shot richets out for a corner. Lucic, who tonight becomes the oldest player to appear in the Champions League, does well to block the subsequent cross. 4 Grimandi and then Luzhney out-grapple fiesty attacking runs from Inzaghi and Salas. 6 Ljunburg pokes the ball down the left flank. But before he can cause any mither, the bald Swede is body-checked by Nesta. Free-kick. 7 Grimandi loses his marker at the near post to dispatch a firm header just wide of the mark. 8 Arsenal enjoy their first spell of possession. The ball is knocked into the galloping Grimandi who directs a well-struck drive straight into the keeper's arms. 11 Henry shimmies and skins Nesta, who then drags him back to concede a foul. The resulting free-kick is wasted. 12 A moment of hesitation between Keown and Luzhney allows Nedved to put the willies up Lucic. However, his cross/shot across the goal fails to be met by any of his teammates. 15 The match livens up after early jousting. Viera and Veron vie for midfield supremecy. 18 Much to annoyance of Lazio's notoriously demanding home support, Arsenal begin to boss the tempo of the game. But with one deft touch, Veron demonstrates his capacity to change a game in an instant. 21 Arsenal continue piling on the pressure with Kanu getting his groove on, Henry cruising into wide spaces and Silvinho threatening to run in on goal from the left wing. 24 GOAL! Fluke. Salas and Inzaghi bobble the ball to each other unconvincingly outside the Arsenal penalty area. A misdirected pass to Nedved invites a challenge from Silvinho. Somehow the ball balloons up and over the stranded Lucic. A red-faced Nedved claims the goal, but his was not the decisive touch. 29 Kanu seems determined to break his duck. He might be trying a bit too hard. 34 Good spell of pressure from Arsenal. Both teams invest much effort in getting an early cross into the box. Yet both teams are getting defenders back in numbers. 35 Off on one of his trademark teasing runs down the left, Silvinho cuts inside and swerves past two Lazio defenders. The young Brazillian finds himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper. But his delicate chip is smoothered by the flailing limbs of Peruzzi. 39 Parlour skips into space, deep inside the Lazio half. But 'ginger locks' fires into deep space. 41Lazio are awarded a free-kick on the right side of the penalty area. Lucic does very well to bat away Mihajlovic's unholy curler . 43 BOOKING. Big Ron says: \"Freddie must be fuming!\" Attempting to see out a stray forward pass, Nesta uses his body to shield the attentions of Ljungberg . But, fearing he may lose the ball to the determined Swede, the Italian resorts to sly fakery - voluntarily falling over and winning a free-kick. Ljungberg earns a caution for protesting his innocence. Half-time. 46 SUBSTITUTION. Claudio Lopez on for Dejan Stankovic. 46 Inzaghi finds himself in acres. But his clips the ball well-wide to the relief of the ageing stand-in goaly. 48 Nedved and Ljungberg almost tear off each others clothes as they battle for the ball. The Lazio hero wins a corner. Lucic does well to get a fist to the inswinging cross. 50 The game opens up with chances at either end. Yet as Arsenal chase the equaliser and throw men forward they looking increasingly susceptible to the premier poaching abilities of Lopez, Salas, Inzaghi et all. 53 The arrival of Lopez gives Lazio much better delivery from the left. 54 FIGHT! The match descends into a ugly brawl. Simeone looks mighty irrate as blood spurts from a gash by his eye. The slow motion replay reveals that Grimandi planted a right hook into the Argentinean's mush. After much pushing and shoving, Nesta finally gets a yellow card that has been a long time coming. 56 Simeone, who went off to bandage up his wound, returns to the field in a vengeful state of consciousness. Grimandi better watch his back. Maybe his bravery has been bouyed by the presence of big John in goal. 58 Arsenal's players seemed to have been unnerved by Simeone's aggresive antics. 63 The game returns to the open attacking pattern it assumed early in the second half. 65 Big Ron asks : \"This Veron is supposed to be one of the best players in the world... where is he?\" Indeed. 68 SUSTITUTION. Crespo- the world's second most expensive striker- comes on for Inzaghi. 69 SUBSTITUTION. Lauren on for Grimandi ; cock of the Gunners chickens out. 70 Lazio win a series of corners. Up steps the hit-and-miss Mihajlovic. His first corner swings in, bang on target. A spooked Arsenal defence scrambles the ball away. His second almost hits the opposite corner flag. 71 Lazio get the ball into the net after a neat exchange of passes between Crespo and Salas. But the ref rightly calls it offside. 74 SUBSTITUTION. Wiltord on for Ljungberg 76 Lauren makes his first meaningful contribution to Arsenal's campaign with a meaningless cross. 78 Big Ron declares : \"The game is calling for a little bit of devil from an Arsenal man.\" Nobody does it better than that jeweled man with the fake tan. 80 That Luzhney has looked impressively nimble, covering for the tiring Tony Adams. 82 Kanu finds himself with the goal at his mercy. His shot is blocked. The big Nigerian recovers the ball but flicks it into his own face before being tackled. At times he personifies grace. At times, he displays Wanchope-esque clumsiness 87 GOAL! Wiltord gets hold of the ball after Arsenal defend a corner. The Frenchman does extremely well to spot the break-neck run of Pires down the right wing and make space for himself to deliver an inch-perfect pass to his compatriot. Pires collects the ball in his stride, balances himself and unleashes a storming right-footed scoop into the top corner. 90 A last minute fright for Arsenal. Somehow Keown conspires to fumble the ball into his own goal. But luckily, the ref spots an earlier infringement and disallows the goal. 93 Full-time. 94Grimandi and Nesta exchange a bit of afters. 95 The Arsenal players applaud their supporters following a well-earned away draw.",

      "bodyText": "Health ministers yesterday took delivery of a \"winter warbook\" identifying trouble spots in the NHS that could flare into crises in the wards after Christmas unless early action is taken to reorganise the service. Officials said Alan Milburn, the health secretary, was preparing to send in help squads to tackle the most serious problems that could be exploited by the Conservatives to damage the credibility of his NHS reform plan in the run-up to the general election. His confidential dossier on the strengths and weaknesses of every part of the NHS, private hospitals, nursing homes and social services was put together over the weekend from reports sent in by the 99 health authorities in England. The volume was said to be \"at least six inches thick, with more pages than a telephone directory.\" Each authority has completed a vulnerability audit of every public and private service in its area to assess whether they are at high, medium or low risk of a winter emergency. Health authority managers will be expected to provide regular updates of their planning for winter, including estimates of how close they are to targets for trolley waits and flu vaccinations. \"This is the biggest planning exercise for winter that the NHS has ever seen,\" a Department of Health source said. \"We are making sure we are forewarned about the likely hotspots and able to send in teams in advance to minimise the problems.\" The dossier was being called a warbook because ministers thought the Tories and some sections of the media would use winter pressures to declare war on the NHS, he said. Earlier this year Mr Milburn allocated \u00a360m for social services to provide alternative provision for older people who might otherwise stay too long in hospital. He set aside \u00a3630m for the NHS to deal with winter pressures, including \u00a3150m for critical care facilities. As a result there will be more than 250 extra critical care beds this winter.

Preliminary health department figures indicate there are 30,000 more people working for the NHS than two years ago, including 10,000 more nurses and 2,800 more therapists. But ministers are not try ing to deny the danger that the service will continue to have capacity problems pending implementation of the NHS plan over the next five years.

Some 45% of DE voters - the unskilled and unemployed - think it should be legalised as do 44% of AB voters - the professional classes. The poll does however show a clear divide between those who want to see the decriminalisation of cannabis but are not yet prepared to see it fully legalised. While 22% said they believed the personal use of cannabis should remain a criminal act, some 30% said the police should not make prosecution a priority and it should effectively be decriminalised. The issue has polarised opinion with only 4% of voters saying they had no opinion on the matter. The findings of this poll, combined with weekend surveys also showing large majorities for decriminalisation, will put Tony Blair and Jack Straw under further pressure to reassess the government's policy on drugs. The next opportunity will come when Home Office ministers give evidence to the Commons home affairs select committee on why they dismissed within hours of publication the Police Foundation report on cannabis published in March. The report, which included two chief constables among its membership, recommended that prison should no longer be used for cannabis possession. Some 4,500 people were imprisoned last year after being convicted of cannabis charges.",

The internet and CD-Roms provide access to a much wider range of information.

It can motivate boys who are reluctant to read books, and help pupils learn key concepts and ideas for their exams.

For whole class teaching I use PowerPoint presentation - projecting an image from my computer onto a screen or electronic whiteboard.

Running a search under the terms religion and religious brings hundreds of thousands of responses - and therein lies the problem for teachers hoping to use the internet as a research tool in their lessons. Where to start? Another problem is that a few sites are as undesirable as the pornography the school's web server is probably programmed to avoid. Responsible teachers will want to steer children away from cults and from some of what passes for religion on sites devoted to far right-wing politics.

      "trailText": "<p>Hole in the wall has a whole new meaning in New Delhi. David Cohen reports on \na remarkable initiative to provide free internet access to slum children.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> A few feet away from the hi-tech offices of New Delhi-based NIIT - a computer training and software services company - stands a tall, yellow wall. For years it has been an anonymous barrier separating internet-haves from the penniless have-nots living in the neighbouring Kalkaji slum in the south of the city. But now the wall has been breached. NIIT engineers installed a kiosk in the wall containing a Pentium PC connected to the internet which gives free net access to any passer-by. The first to tinker with the kiosk were kids.</p> <p> \"Straightaway children approached and began learning how to operate the computer,\" says Sugata Mitra, director of research and development at NIIT. \"No one showed them how to use it. They came on their own, because they were curious, and learnt by a process of trial and error.\" Within an hour they had learnt how to manipulate the mouse through the touch pad. Mitra had set up the web browser pointing at www.altavista.com and moments later they worked out \"almost by accident\" how to click and surf the web. Grown-ups showed no interest. But, despite their lack of education, groups of children aged 6-12 swarmed around the machine all day.</p> <p> Most slum children do not go to school, are very poor and speak only Hindi. Many did not even know what the computer was - they just called it 'the thing'. Yet through Mitra's lassez-faire approach, they taught themselves how to use a mouse, browse the net, play games and even download and play Hindi music files. Mitra installed a video camera on a tree nearby to watch over the kiosk and observe what the children did. Through the NIIT computer network he also monitored their surfing and computer usage habits to see where they went and which programs they spent their time using. </p> <p> \"Disney.com is very popular with them because they like games,\" says Mitra. The children found a game starring Mickey Mouse, whom they affectionately re-named 'the rat'. \"They also use Microsoft Paint. It's very, very popular with all of them,\" says Mitra. The children come from very deprived areas and often do not have easy access to paper and paint. One day Mitra intervened and played an MP3 digital music file in front of a group of children. \"They were astonished to hear music come out of the computer and asked: 'Does it work like a TV or radio?' In keeping with my no instruction approach, I said: 'Well, I know how to get there but I don't know how it works.' Then I left.\" Within seven days they had discovered what MP3 was, downloaded free players, found where Hindi music was on the web and played it non-stop. </p> <p> \"As usual they didn't know what any of it was called,\" says Mitra. \"But they figured out exactly how to use it.\" Most of the children could not read English and invented their own names for objects on the screen. Computer, mouse and icon are all English words born of Western ideas. Mitra was fascinated by the terms the kids employed to describe the new technology they were encountering. The hourglass - used to show the computer is working - is an alien term in India. \"The kids use the word damru,\" says Mitra. \"The god Shiva has a drum that he shakes - the drum is called damru in Hindi - and it's shaped just like an hourglass. So that's the word they came up with.\" The kids called the on-screen pointer, 'sui'. In Hindi this means 'needle'. When the computer is busy, the sui turns into the damru. \"Who cares if they don't know what the correct terms are?\" says Mitra. \"The terminology is not as important as the metaphor.\"</p> <p> These are just some of the surprises that Mitra and his colleagues discovered during the project. Another two experiments are now running in other poor areas with similar results. India's population recently passed one billion, yet there are just one million internet users in the country to date. These experiments have led Mitra to speculate on a grand scheme to educate India's children to use the net. \"One kiosk, which taught some 160 children, cost 150,000 rupees (\u00a32,343) to build plus the same again for the dedicated internet connection and maintenance. If we built 100,000 kiosks it would cost US$2bn (\u00a31.4bn) to keep them running for five years. In that time, assuming 200 children learn from each kiosk each year, 100 million children would become computer literate. </p> <p> \"The 13 year-olds of today would be 18. They would vote. I think we would have irreversible social change in India.\" The British social think tank, the Institute for Social Inventions, applauds Mitra's vision. This summer it awarded the project the prize for social invention of the year because of its novel method of empowering large numbers of people in a lasting way. It's a resounding affirmation of the idea, but whether the project really breaks down the poverty barrier around the slum for these and other slum children only time (and money) will tell.</p> <p>This and other awards are detailed in the Book of Inspirations (\u00a315), published by the Institute of Social Inventions, tel: 020-8208 2853.</p>",

For years it has been an anonymous barrier separating internet-haves from the penniless have-nots living in the neighbouring Kalkaji slum in the south of the city. But now the wall has been breached. NIIT engineers installed a kiosk in the wall containing a Pentium PC connected to the internet which gives free net access to any passer-by. The first to tinker with the kiosk were kids. \"Straightaway children approached and began learning how to operate the computer,\" says Sugata Mitra, director of research and development at NIIT. \"No one showed them how to use it. They came on their own, because they were curious, and learnt by a process of trial and error.\" Within an hour they had learnt how to manipulate the mouse through the touch pad. Mitra had set up the web browser pointing at www.altavista.com and moments later they worked out \"almost by accident\" how to click and surf the web. Grown-ups showed no interest. But, despite their lack of education, groups of children aged 6-12 swarmed around the machine all day. Most slum children do not go to school, are very poor and speak only Hindi. Many did not even know what the computer was - they just called it 'the thing'. Yet through Mitra's lassez-faire approach, they taught themselves how to use a mouse, browse the net, play games and even download and play Hindi music files. Mitra installed a video camera on a tree nearby to watch over the kiosk and observe what the children did. Through the NIIT computer network he also monitored their surfing and computer usage habits to see where they went and which programs they spent their time using. \"Disney.com is very popular with them because they like games,\" says Mitra. The children found a game starring Mickey Mouse, whom they affectionately re-named 'the rat'. \"They also use Microsoft Paint. It's very, very popular with all of them,\" says Mitra. The children come from very deprived areas and often do not have easy access to paper and paint. One day Mitra intervened and played an MP3 digital music file in front of a group of children. \"They were astonished to hear music come out of the computer and asked: 'Does it work like a TV or radio?' In keeping with my no instruction approach, I said: 'Well, I know how to get there but I don't know how it works.' Then I left.\" Within seven days they had discovered what MP3 was, downloaded free players, found where Hindi music was on the web and played it non-stop. \"As usual they didn't know what any of it was called,\" says Mitra. \"But they figured out exactly how to use it.\" Most of the children could not read English and invented their own names for objects on the screen. Computer, mouse and icon are all English words born of Western ideas. Mitra was fascinated by the terms the kids employed to describe the new technology they were encountering. The hourglass - used to show the computer is working - is an alien term in India. \"The kids use the word damru,\" says Mitra. \"The god Shiva has a drum that he shakes - the drum is called damru in Hindi - and it's shaped just like an hourglass. So that's the word they came up with.\" The kids called the on-screen pointer, 'sui'. In Hindi this means 'needle'. When the computer is busy, the sui turns into the damru. \"Who cares if they don't know what the correct terms are?\" says Mitra. \"The terminology is not as important as the metaphor.\" These are just some of the surprises that Mitra and his colleagues discovered during the project. Another two experiments are now running in other poor areas with similar results. India's population recently passed one billion, yet there are just one million internet users in the country to date. These experiments have led Mitra to speculate on a grand scheme to educate India's children to use the net. \"One kiosk, which taught some 160 children, cost 150,000 rupees (\u00a32,343) to build plus the same again for the dedicated internet connection and maintenance. If we built 100,000 kiosks it would cost US$2bn (\u00a31.4bn) to keep them running for five years. In that time, assuming 200 children learn from each kiosk each year, 100 million children would become computer literate. \"The 13 year-olds of today would be 18. They would vote. I think we would have irreversible social change in India.\" The British social think tank, the Institute for Social Inventions, applauds Mitra's vision. This summer it awarded the project the prize for social invention of the year because of its novel method of empowering large numbers of people in a lasting way. It's a resounding affirmation of the idea, but whether the project really breaks down the poverty barrier around the slum for these and other slum children only time (and money) will tell. This and other awards are detailed in the Book of Inspirations (\u00a315), published by the Institute of Social Inventions, tel: 020-8208 2853.",

I tried a lesson in Spanish from scratch, checking I had a soundcard, a headset and a fast enough computer (333 Pentium is ideal but it works with a little less memory). I then downloaded Microsoft Netmeeting from Netlearn's website (free, and it took 10 minutes). </p> <p> My teacher, Ines, appeared live on the Netmeeting screen via a videocamera and opened a whiteboard next to it. This was set up with the Spanish alphabet, and a series of nouns, articles and verbs which Ines had prepared as an introduction. Watching and listening to her alongside the whiteboard made it easy for me to link the sounds and the writing. Ines used a highlighter to pick up points I specially needed to work on, and typed in additional notes. This let me concentrate exclusively on her explanations (often in English, and quite right too, as I could ask questions and understand the answers), and had my notes ready-made by saving the whiteboard. Homework was built into the lesson if I wanted it, but most Netlearn clients don't. By the end of the lesson, I could compose simple sentences in Spanish, and had a basic idea of how the language hangs together. </p> <p> Netlearn's website suggests it takes 500 hours' work to learn a language to near-native speaker level, which includes considerable private study time. It's not cheap at \u00a329.50 an hour for individual lessons or \u00a39 per hour for work in a group of six (minimum two hours per week and two hours homework on this system), but for pupils wanting to swot up for GCSE or A-level and needing some extra coaching, with no travel involved, it could be a life-saver. My lesson was skilfully taught, with a nice personal touch.

In addition to conventional reading, writing and listening exercises, the programme detects poorly pronounced words within sentences. Students who are struggling with individual sounds can view an animation to see how the mouth moves to articulate them. Buy the software and you are allowed two weeks' free tutoring; after that you pay around \u00a312 a month. You can use it offline to complete the exercises in a customised programme.

Given the potential for learning that CD-Roms provide it is a shame that more companies do not take more seriously, as Headstrong Interactive does, the educational aims of their software. \u0095 Headstrong Interactive, tel: 01484 660770 \u0095 Longman, tel: 01279 623623 \u0095 Cromwell, tel: 01789 415187",

      "body": "<p>Harold Wilson's 'white heat of technology' has finally arrived nearly 40 years late - and it's in the classroom. Government figures published last month show some 86% of primary schools can access the web - 12,500 more than in 1998 - and 92% of secondaries are online. </p> <p> Average expenditure from central government on ICT for teaching and learning was \u00a341,800 per school in 1999. So how is the future shaping up? Firstly, in schools that have moved ahead most in ICT, developments have been driven by empowered and connected teachers confident enough to shape ICT to meet their classroom. Secondly, the progress of ICT in whole class teaching points to the end of 'computer room mentality', and wireless communication and portable computers have played a major part here. Last month the Isle of Man bought 500 Airport wireless networking cards for the teachers' Apple laptop computers so they can move about the class with their machines and still stay connected to the internet and network printers. And in Cornwallis School, Maidstone, over 100 Acer laptop computers are now linked to a school-wide wireless network.</p> <p> Thirdly, new collaborative learning software and permanent high speed access to resources over the internet is allowing inter-school conferencing and communication to grow, using voice and image tools alongside text. In five years' time 'computer rooms' will be as old hat as separate rooms for the TV or the slate. Computers are coming to the classroom, not vice-versa.</p> <p> New types of collaborative learning software like RM's Discourse are starting to emerge. Here students and teachers can collaborate and question as they build their own bodies of knowledge over school computer networks. It gives a digital alternative to the 'hands up' method of classroom interraction with obvious benefits for those too shy or unsure to go public. Whole class teaching with ICT has taken hold in many schools thanks to a rise in quality and a drop in price of the data projector - a device that takes the computer display and projects it onto any wall or screen so that the whole class may see and share. To help teachers further, many companies provide interactive whiteboards - in effect giant touchscreens through which teachers can operate the computer. </p> <p> Joanna Felton, ICT co-ordinator at Eastwood junior school, Southend-on-Sea, enthuses about her interactive whiteboard from Time Computers. 'It gains the pupils' attention instantly and motivates the pupils wonderfully. A colleague has been using the Virtual Whiteboard tools to plan stories with the whole class who take it in turns to write on the board with the electronic pen.'</p> <p> Interactive whiteboard specialist Promethean has just announced a further level of interactivity for its ACTIVBoard whiteboards by adding an infrared tablet to the basic system. This allows students to take control of the front of class display so that they may add their comments or point out areas about which they are unsure. Schools may also buy hand-held voting pads so that every student can take part in contributing to questions - just the thing for end-of-lesson review summaries. Such systems cost around \u00a34,000 but cheaper options are emerging. One of the most revolutionary is the Mimio, a \u00a3350 sensing device with software, which can be fixed to any ordinary whiteboard via two stout sucker pads. Sensors record any writing or drawing on the board onto the screen of a connected computer - work that can be saved as web pages for perusal later. </p> <p> This tool has amazing potential to record key lessons for later use and distribution on school networks. The Mimio can also be used with a projector to mimic the effects of a full, interactive whiteboard - although my test model did not match the accuracy or the sophistication of these devices. Even so, teachers and parents need convincing that this sort of approach is right. Last week in Hammersmith I sat a little humbled as the visiting expert at Larmenier Infant School, while the head, Sister Hannah, and parents detailed their vision of how ICT could be adapted as a whole class teaching tool with resources like interactive whiteboards for students aged 4 to 7. </p> <p> The school had not imposed an idea of the future - it was having an open debate At 9.15pm I counted 52 parents and teachers in the audience, all there to discuss, argue and cajole until they reached an understanding on how ICT could best meet the needs of their children. Some parents spoke powerfully about the danger of too much screenwork - others detailed quiet moments at home when they sat at the computer with their children. At the end of the session, though, the teachers felt they had the parents' approval to proceed with the learning aims of whole class teaching assisted by ICT. The revolution starts here when schools like Larmenier take control of developments and shape them to their ends. </p> <p><strong>Whole class 1: Whiteboard wizard</strong></p> <p> Wendy Bowe is head of ICT at North Cumbria Technology College, which is trying out a ground-breaking device</p> <p> We have been using two Mimio devices for several months now to turn two ordinary whiteboards into large touch screens. The Mimio is a sensor which fixes to the side of an ordinary whiteboard and detects the movement of a pen on the screen which it sends back to the computer. When run in mouse mode it converts any touch on the screen to a click on the computer to which it is attached.</p> <p> It's ideal for demonstrating CD-Roms or web pages. When used with a computer projector, it allows us to use resources straight from the web with whole class groups. Using projectors with computers in the past has often caused problems as it divides pupils' attention between the screen and the teacher who had to sit behind a computer. With the Mimio the teacher is at the front so the pupils are focused on them.</p> <p> At present, we are piloting some excellent online resources from the BBC. These provide much of the content for geography at KS3 and students work through them on their own computers. When new concepts emerge, however, it's essential that the whole group can be brought back together and taught as a class; with the Mimio and the projector we are able to do this. Unless we call students together to teach key points we are not making the most of the opportunity. The school is connected to the internet using a fast ISDN connection; we have also set up our own media server to store video clips and sound which staff can use in their lessons. With these approaches we can put the teachers back at the centre in the world of digital media. </p> <p> <strong>Whole class 2: Symbols at the front</strong></p> <p>Sally Adds, a mother of five, has always wanted to write software for handicapped children. She now works part-time at Woodlands Special School, Chelsmford</p> <p> My motivation comes from my daughter Helen, who can't talk or understand speech. I was determined to tap into her understanding by using photographs and video, and so I bought myself a digital video camera and an Apple Macintosh computer. Next I learned Flash animation software, with the help of Geoff Dellow, a tutor who I call on the phone for lessons. He talks me through the software, helping me to solve problems as he introduces new skills. One day I looked at some printed symbols we use all the time as a communication device and it clicked that I could improve them by making them move.</p> <p> I started to develop animated symbols so children could see more clearly what they represented from the real world. I now have a library of walking symbols showing basic skills like sitting down and eating. Working part-time at Woodlands, I help students by bringing movement to a world that has been static. The headteacher, Oliver Caviglioli, has just written a book called Mapwise which looks afresh at how learners' understanding transcends the limitations of linear text . By using his ideas and an interactive whiteboard we are now building complete maps of understanding using video and symbol animations. Teachers use these with whole class groups. Sometimes it feels as if I'm the only one out there but I know it's worth it. Helen is nearly 14 and with these tools I want her to be able to say what she needs. </p> <p><strong> Whole class 3: Networking music</strong></p> <p>Philip Wright is head of music at John Henry Newman, a large Catholic comprehensive in Stevenage</p> <p>In the summer the school was networked and connected to the internet. Each department was given two network connections and we put one in our main teaching classroom. This is proving invaluable. During a lesson with year 10 on contemporary dance music, I wanted to illustrate an earlier form. From the site <a href=\"http://www.mp3.com\"> mp3.com</a> I accessed and played a copyright-free minuet - pausing it to make my points on form. I saved it to the network so that students could access it for their coursework. The file moved from the internet onto the airwaves and it all took less than two minutes. I am now building a library of files for the choir. We regularly download midi files which students play through our keyboards and adapt. Starting with an existing melody helps them be more creative in the early stages. Next I want to use interactive whiteboards to introduce composition to whole class groups. </p> <p> <strong>Whole class 4: A test of understanding</strong><br></p> <p> Sean O'Reilly is head of ICT at Ashcroft High school, a large comprehensive in Luton, Bedfordshire. <br></p> <p>The school has been using Discourse software from RM which allows students to ask and answer questions as part of a normal lesson or an end-of-module test. I was struck by the potential of Discourse the first time I used it. Since it is based on Internet Explorer, it runs easily over the school network and staff and students feel familiar with the interface. As I am able to send messages to target and get feedback from every student it means that there is no room for students not participating.</p> <p> I am now using the software with students from year 7 to 11. A major strength is that Discourse is content-free, so suitable for any subject area. It generates open-ended questions, which means that lesson preparation time is not a concern. It's an ideal tool for testing understanding and challenging misconceptions. The software also helps to build knowledge in a structured way. Discourse is a great step forward in using ICT to help teachers by monitoring every student in their class.</p> <p> It's a superb example of extending ICT as a teaching tool. Other staff are using the software; one recently remarked that the best thing about this approach to online learning is that Discourse allows them to see which students understand and which students don't understand what the hell I'm trying to teach them. There is no hiding with Discourse. Once teachers build their confidence in using the software they are able to use a student's written answers immediately as a basis for their next question or to make a point for the whole group. </p> <p> \u0095 Classroom of the Future Report at: <a href=\"http://www.futureclass.ngfl.gov.uk\">futureclass.ngfl.gov.uk</a><br></p> <p>\u0095 Time Computers, tel: 01282 777799 <a href=\"http://www.timeeducation.com\">www.timeeducation.com</a><br></p> <p>\u0095 Promethean, 01524 298526 <a href=\"http://www.promethean.co.uk\">www.promethean.co.uk </a><br></p> <p> \u0095 RM, 0870 9086868 <a href=\"http://www.www.rm.com\">www.rm.com </a> <br></p> <p> \u0095 Mimio: <a href=\"http://www.mimio.com\">www.mimio.com</a> Virtual Ink, 0870 458 3344 </p> <p> \u0095 John Davitt is a freelance ICT in education adviser <a href=\"mailto:davitt@rmplc.co.uk\"> davitt@rmplc.co.uk</a></p>",

Hours before a train derailment at Hatfield in Hertfordshire killed four, nine passengers on the No 41 minibus became trapped by the automatic barriers at a level crossing at Pooley Green, near Egham in Surrey, at 9.15am. As the empty commuter train bore down on them, its horn blaring, the bus driver led them to safety. The impact derailed the front carriage of the eight-car South West Trains train. It was left lying across the tracks at an angle of 30 degrees, blocking the line in both directions. Before it came to a stop the train shunted the bus 70 yards across gardens and into the wall of a nearby cottage. The cottage resident, who is in her 70s, was treated for shock at the scene after she returned from a shopping trip to find that the bus had knocked a chunk out of her living room wall. Beryl Manning, 68, who lives opposite the level crossing in Vicarage Road, Egham, was putting out her rubbish when she heard the train's horn. Mrs Manning said: \"It got louder and louder and all of a sudden there was an almighty crash. \"There were a couple of people who looked like they were in a bit of shock. They told me they had jumped off the bus.\" Railtrack confirmed the bus had been trapped by traffic while trying to cross the track.

      "body": "<p><strong>WHAM BAM, THANK YOU STANLEY</strong></p> <p>Is Stanley Victor Collymore on the mend? That is the question the Fiver must ask this afternoon after news reached us that the renowned former England striker actually left his bedroom yesterday. Admittedly, he left it to turn out for Leicester reserves, have an argument with a teammate on the pitch, carry it on into the dressing room at half-time, and storm off in a huff when substituted. But it is a start.</p> <p>As ever with Stanley, his latest faux pas could not have been better timed. Just as he set off a fire extinguisher at La Manga when some people thought his trouble-making days were over, last night's incident occurred after Peter Taylor had told local radio audiences that there was still a way back for Colly. Indeed, if Stanley had bothered to complete the match, it would have been his first full 90 minutes of the season.</p> <p>\"We can confirm we are investigating a half-time dressing room incident which took place at last night's reserve game at Filbert Street,\" Paul Mace, the Foxes' swankily-titled director of media and communications, said. \"We will not be in a position to comment further until the investigation has been completed.\" </p> <p>Very wise. But not all that interesting, so thank God for a Foxy fan site (<a href=\"http://www.thebluearmy.co.uk\">www.thebluearmy.co.uk</a>) which quotes \"an unnamed Charlton player\" who reckons Stanley was punched by his teammate. \"Collymore was out of order from the start, slagging off his team-mate and calling him lazy and using foul language\", he claimed. \"The lad cracked at half-time and chinned him. It was ironic, because Collymore himself was strolling through the game.\" You don't say.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>ADVERTISEMENT</strong></p> <p>Free personal reminders, news, sports, weather, horoscopes and lottery results sent direct to your Vodafone by text; register now with <a href=\"http://www.vizzavi.co.uk\">www.vizzavi.co.uk</a> and keep informed anywhere.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>SOMETHING BORO'D, SOMETHING BLUE</strong> </p> <p>After being thoroughly outplayed on your home soil by (vaguely) local rivals. After failing to garner a home win for all of seven months. After being booed off by your long-suffering fans. What do you do? Well, some people might consider resigning. Others might adopt a change of tactics. Yet others might immediately try and sign another 30-something millionaire midfielder whose best days are behind him. Can you guess which strategy Bryan Robson uses?</p> <p>Unconfirmed reports today suggest that Boro officials have \"jetted out\" (not got on a jet, you understand, but actually attached twin turbines to their shoulder blades) in an attempt to sign Milan's Zvonimir Boban for \u00a32m, or thereabouts. Of course, Robbo has done this sort of thing before without much success (ie Dani, Steve McManaman, Jimbo Hasselbaink, Marco Gabbiadini etc), but this time could be different. Boban has mostly been warming the bench for Milan this season and, it is believed, he is keen to play with his pal Alen Boksic.</p> <p>Boro are playing it cool at the moment, refusing to deny anything, and saying only: \"We have no information at the moment.\" While this may not be the first time Boro have been without a clue this season, it might just mean they're in with a chance of signing the Croat playmaker. At the same time Boro have also resumed talks with Ugo Ehiogu over his proposed \u00a38m move to the Riverside. Could this be a happy, bright new dawn, or just another couple of names on the list of overpaid underachievers? Can you guess which option is the more likely?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Of course it will touch on Terry Venables. I wouldn't be able to write a book without touching on those subjects.\" Eddie Ashby, Tel's former \"business associate\", who just happens to have a book coming out at the same time as his old pal is up for the England job.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>MY WEAH</strong></p> <p>At tea-time yesterday, George Weah's quickie divorce from Manchester City seemed to be relatively civil. There was no \"keep your bitch on a lead\" Jerry Springer-esque mudslinging outside court, no smashing of prized heirlooms - just an endless sea of goodwill on both sides. George was happy because he had 'earned' \u00a3750,000 for just two months work. Joe Royle was happy because he had got rid of an over-the-hill stallion that was now firing blanks.

      "bodyText": "WHAM BAM, THANK YOU STANLEY Is Stanley Victor Collymore on the mend? That is the question the Fiver must ask this afternoon after news reached us that the renowned former England striker actually left his bedroom yesterday. Admittedly, he left it to turn out for Leicester reserves, have an argument with a teammate on the pitch, carry it on into the dressing room at half-time, and storm off in a huff when substituted. But it is a start. As ever with Stanley, his latest faux pas could not have been better timed. Just as he set off a fire extinguisher at La Manga when some people thought his trouble-making days were over, last night's incident occurred after Peter Taylor had told local radio audiences that there was still a way back for Colly. Indeed, if Stanley had bothered to complete the match, it would have been his first full 90 minutes of the season. \"We can confirm we are investigating a half-time dressing room incident which took place at last night's reserve game at Filbert Street,\" Paul Mace, the Foxes' swankily-titled director of media and communications, said. \"We will not be in a position to comment further until the investigation has been completed.\" Very wise. But not all that interesting, so thank God for a Foxy fan site (www.thebluearmy.co.uk) which quotes \"an unnamed Charlton player\" who reckons Stanley was punched by his teammate. \"Collymore was out of order from the start, slagging off his team-mate and calling him lazy and using foul language\", he claimed. \"The lad cracked at half-time and chinned him. It was ironic, because Collymore himself was strolling through the game.\" You don't say. * * * * * * * * * * * * * ADVERTISEMENT Free personal reminders, news, sports, weather, horoscopes and lottery results sent direct to your Vodafone by text; register now with www.vizzavi.co.uk and keep informed anywhere. * * * * * * * * * * * * * SOMETHING BORO'D, SOMETHING BLUE After being thoroughly outplayed on your home soil by (vaguely) local rivals. After failing to garner a home win for all of seven months. After being booed off by your long-suffering fans. What do you do? Well, some people might consider resigning. Others might adopt a change of tactics. Yet others might immediately try and sign another 30-something millionaire midfielder whose best days are behind him. Can you guess which strategy Bryan Robson uses? Unconfirmed reports today suggest that Boro officials have \"jetted out\" (not got on a jet, you understand, but actually attached twin turbines to their shoulder blades) in an attempt to sign Milan's Zvonimir Boban for \u00a32m, or thereabouts. Of course, Robbo has done this sort of thing before without much success (ie Dani, Steve McManaman, Jimbo Hasselbaink, Marco Gabbiadini etc), but this time could be different. Boban has mostly been warming the bench for Milan this season and, it is believed, he is keen to play with his pal Alen Boksic. Boro are playing it cool at the moment, refusing to deny anything, and saying only: \"We have no information at the moment.\" While this may not be the first time Boro have been without a clue this season, it might just mean they're in with a chance of signing the Croat playmaker. At the same time Boro have also resumed talks with Ugo Ehiogu over his proposed \u00a38m move to the Riverside. Could this be a happy, bright new dawn, or just another couple of names on the list of overpaid underachievers? Can you guess which option is the more likely? * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Of course it will touch on Terry Venables. I wouldn't be able to write a book without touching on those subjects.\" Eddie Ashby, Tel's former \"business associate\", who just happens to have a book coming out at the same time as his old pal is up for the England job. * * * * * * * * * * * * * MY WEAH At tea-time yesterday, George Weah's quickie divorce from Manchester City seemed to be relatively civil. There was no \"keep your bitch on a lead\" Jerry Springer-esque mudslinging outside court, no smashing of prized heirlooms - just an endless sea of goodwill on both sides. George was happy because he had 'earned' \u00a3750,000 for just two months work. Joe Royle was happy because he had got rid of an over-the-hill stallion that was now firing blanks. And the Fiver was happy too, just because it was. So you can imagine our surprise when we retreated from the pub this morning to find that George had attacked Joe for making him \"look small in front of younger players\" and accused him of telling him to \"shut up and f**k off.\" But barely had the Fiver recovered from such profanity - where's the bleep machine when you need one? - when Joe retaliated, insisting that \"no player at this club has ever been helped more, given more assistance or more respect.

      "body": "<b>1. Character </b> <p>George Bush has been marked as a grinning airhead with little knowledge of domestic issues and none of foreign affairs. Rumours about his behaviour at university and videos of him drunk at a wedding party have not helped his cause. However, the Yale and Harvard-educated Bush is no dimwit, even if he doesn't pretend to match Al Gore for intellect and has never written a book. On the contrary, his amiable vagueness is an attraction for many voters: it certainly didn't do Ronald Reagan any harm.</p> <p>Al Gore is leaden where Mr Bush is light, informed where Mr Bush is ignorant. His worthy plugging of the merits of big government means he scores well with the electorate on policy issues. But voters see him as excruciatingly dull: a sort of know-all teacher's pet. That is not the kind of president most Americans want and is the prime reason his campaign is in trouble. As a result, Mr Gore is trying to show the softer side to his character, kissing his wife passionately at this summer's Democratic convention and even giving an interview barefoot on a beach. Will this do the trick by polling day? If it does, the White House will almost certainly be his. </p> <p>The third man shaping the election is the sitting president, Bill Clinton, whose influence is being felt in two big ways. The Lewinsky affair and Mr Clinton's high-pressure fundraising techniques have tainted Mr Gore's reputation for moral integrity. Meanwhile, Mr Clinton's success in combining economic growth with a budget surplus has boosted the Democratic cause. Republicans have found it hard to convince voters that America has been mismanaged while Al Gore has been number two at the White House.</p> <p><b>2. Vice-presidents</b> </p> <p>The battle of character extends to the deputies. Both were chosen to make up for the weaknesses of the main candidates.</p> <p>Al Gore is running with the Connecticut senator Joseph Lieberman. As a strong moral critic of Bill Clinton's personal behaviour, he has added credibility to the Gore campaign. Not least because, as a devout Orthodox Jew, Mr Lieberman appeals to many voters doubtful about the integrity of his running mate. If Mr Gore wins, commentators will see Mr Lieberman's selection as a key factor in his success.</p> <p>Dick Cheney, George Bush's deputy, has had a lesser impact on the campaign. A prosperous oil executive from Wyoming, he has a long record of service in high office, including a spell as defence secretary to Mr Bush's father, the former president. As such, Mr Cheney has added gravitas to a lightweight campaign, but not enough to outweigh more pressing factors.</p> <p><b>3. Debates</b> </p> <p>In a close year, the series of televised debates between the presidential candidates can swing the election. </p> <p>This year, Al Gore was widely tipped to crush George Bush in each of the three 90-minute official debates and romp to power. So far, it hasn't worked out that way. Mr Gore's aggressive style in the first debate saw him beat Mr Bush on points - but polls afterwards showed that voters liked Mr Bush's gentle approach. </p> <p>Mr Gore changed his style in the second debate, only to find commentators slamming him for letting Mr Bush's assertions pass unchallenged. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the single vice-presidential debate resembled a friendly fireside chat. Overall, then, this year's debates have settled nothing. The field is still wide open.</p> <p><b>4. Texas</b> </p> <p>Al Gore is pushing the Texas factor hard, claiming that his rival's poor record on education and pollution as the governor of the state makes him unfit to run the country. But Mr Bush's campaign has been just as eager to rebut all the claims and the tit-for-tat warfare is likely to alienate voters, not energise them. </p> <p>One issue can't be hidden, though: Texas' rapid-fire use of the death penalty. Though both candidates say they support its use, many voters find the 145 executions Mr Bush has authorised as governor hard to stomach. Many others, of course, welcome the Texan's hardline stance on crime. The impact on election day is hard to predict. </p> <p><b>5. Minor candidates</b> </p> <p>The focus may be on the two-horse race, but two outsiders could influence the outcome by stealing votes from the main candidates. </p> <p>Of these, Ralph Nader, running as a Green, will have the biggest impact. Almost all his supporters are natural Democrats, whose support Al Gore will badly miss. National polls put Mr Nader on 2-5%, which is bigger than the margin of difference in many states and could hand victory to George Bush.</p> <p>Pat Buchanan, the fourth candidate, scores only around 1% in the polls - but as an ex-Republican running as a rightwing Reform candidate he will cost Mr Bush some votes. Mr Buchanan is most interesting for his running mate: against expectations he chose a black woman, Ezola Foster.</p> <p><b>6. Abortion</b> </p> <p>The United States has always been unsettled about abortion. Many voters and politicians abhor it, while others defend a woman's right to choose.</p> <p>Al Gore comes down in the latter camp; Bush, almost certainly, in the former. </p> <p>Some voters fear that Bush will appoint hardline judges to the supreme court, who will overturn the court's crucial decision in favour of abortion. That fear works in Gore's favour. </p> <p><b>7. Health Care</b> </p> <p>Al Gore promises to spend money to control the cost of prescription drugs and to ensure all Americans have access to health care, a stance popular with older voters. It may be the reason for his campaign proving unexpectedly competitive in Florida, the retirees' state.</p> <p>George W Bush says much the same, but then describes Medicare, the state safety net for the old, as \"outdated\". This kind of talk worries some voters, though it reassures others who would prefer government money to return to them in the form of tax cuts.</p> <p><b>8. Taxation</b> </p> <p>The healthy state of the US economy means that government income exceeds expenditure. The dilemma for the candidates is: what balance should they strike between tax cuts and expenditure? </p> <p>George Bush plans to devote half of the surplus \"to saving Social Security\u0085 one-quarter for pro-growth tax cuts; and the remainder to reform education, strengthen Medicare, and support other priorities\". </p> <p>Al Gore proposes a complex scheme of targeted tax relief, covering things such as health care, the environment, business growth and college education. This has appealed to voters worried that a Republican president would slash welfare programmes, but alienated others who see Gore as an outdated fan of interventionist big government.</p> <p><b>9. Education</b> </p> <p>George Bush has not made education a priority, in contrast with Al Gore, the traditional Democrat. </p> <p>Gore's plan involves greater federal supervision of the nation's schools and a sizeable increase in spending - another complex scheme which appeals to some voters and deters others. </p> <p><b>10. Foreign Policy</b> </p> <p>Foreign policy issues have not made headlines in the campaign so far, but events in Yugoslavia and the Middle East have pushed them up front in these last weeks before polling day. </p> <p>Polls show that Republicans are trusted more than Democrats when it comes to standing up for American interests around the world. That's the good news for George Bush. </p> <p>The bad is that no one doubts that it is Al Gore who has a far better understanding of world affairs. The question is whether Americans want a foreign policy expert in the White House. The two candidates' strengths and weaknesses on the issue will probably cancel each other out.</p> <p><b>11. Petrol</b> </p> <p>The rising price of oil has hit American motorists in their wallets and they are not happy. The issue carries dangers for both candidates.</p> <p>Al Gore has a reputation as an environmentalist who wants to reduce car use and regards energy taxation as a good thing. Voters who believe that he will increase petrol prices still further will be wary of electing him.</p> <p>George Bush and his running mate have both made money from oil companies, which many Americans see as one of the causes of rising gas prices. They may turn against Bush for profiting from their troubles.</p>",

      "body": "<p> Sometimes reviewers bend over backwards to try to be nice. That was the sense I had from several reviews of Peter Ackroyd's London: The Biography (Chatto and Windus, \u00a325). There was amazement at the scope of the project, joy in its abundance, but a delicately phrased suggestion that it didn't quite work as a book. It mirrored the chaos of the city, but wasn't a text supposed to reduce chaos to order? </p> <p> \"At times the reader can become lost in the byways of his imagination,\" wrote <strong>Andrew Holgate</strong> in the <strong>Sunday Times</strong>. \"The sheer weight of incidental detail can also be oppressive, and as many as five separate centuries can sometimes elide in a single paragraph as he attempts to reanimate, say, the satanic conditions experienced by London's prisoners... This is history written by a novelist, passionate, inexact and impressionistic, sometimes inspired, at other times maddeningly vague and overblown.\"</p> <p> Holgate's final judgement sided with Ackroyd. \"The past few years have seen a millennial flood of histories of London; many of them will last, but you can be sure that none of them will match the sheer virtuosity or spirit exhibited by this flawed but compelling book.\" But by then the damage was done. Isn't impressionistic history bad history?</p> <p><strong>Iain Sinclair</strong>, in the <strong>Guardian</strong>, also had doubts: \"London: The Biography is an antiquarian project, a city of words, a public monument to set alongside the sculptures of Henry Moore. This is a final tribute to an unworkable notion of the epic. It is extraordinary that it exists and that its existence shames the city of bricks and mortar.\"</p> <p>Sinclair interpreted the book as a paean to a \"Falstaffian past\" and an attack on an \"anorexic present\". <strong>Peter Preston</strong>, in the <strong>Observer</strong>, detected no such subtext, and saw it as a hymn to London past, present and future. Preston became dewy-eyed contemplating the city which, like Ackroyd, he loves. \"This isn't, for good or ill, a city for city planners. It shuns - even after the disasters of the Great Fire or the Blitz - the grand dream as solution: and where there is a small, mistaken dream, like the tower block, it soon shrugs it off. London believes in muddling through, making up its own destiny as it goes along. </p> <p><strong>Kathryn Hughes</strong>, in the <strong>Sunday Telegraph</strong>, sat awkwardly on the fence, but echoed Sinclair's suggestion that the city's present was not captured with the force of its teeming past. \"Peter Ackroyd has written an episodically brilliant book. No one gets London - especially pungent, raucous, randy London - quite as well as he. The biography is a kind of love poem to the city which shaped Ackroyd's imagination and granted him one of the most distinguished literary careers of the late 20th century. Just what he makes of its present is not quite so clear.\"</p> <p><strong>Roy Porter</strong>, in the <strong>Times</strong>, enjoyed the book and defended its eccentricities: \"One cannot but marvel at Ackroyd's erudition, his energy in marshalling minutiae, his ear for quotation, his flair for dazzling juxtapositions, his vibrant imagination and sheer exuberance. To aficionados of conventional 'biographies', Ackroyd's contrariness may be perplexing - thus we hear of the Tube before London's railways. But there is method in his madness, for he explains that London throbs with a multiplicity of 'times', independent of chronology, rather as geological unconformities crop out unpredictably at the surface.\"</p> <p>But Porter's conclusion worried me: \"As Ackroyd remarks, this is not a biography to be read doggedly from cover to cover. Put it by your bedside and open it at random. Like sticking a pin in the A to Z and going on a mystery visit, it's an exercise which will have its dull moments as well as its delights. But in that this idiosyncratic book only mirrors the unique city itself.\" A book best opened an random does not sound like a very good book.</p> <p>Only <strong>David Sexton</strong>, in the <strong>London Evening Standard</strong>, really seemed to adore it, and his enthusiasm was infectious. \"There are chapters and mini-chapters on a wonderful profusion of topics: the noise, the smell, the drinking, the eating, the crowds, the flowers, the fogs, the murderers, the suicides, the wells, the lost rivers, the beggars,the prisons, the gambling, the sexual licence, the fires, the accents, the executions, the immigrants, the suburbs, the lights, the bells, the rubbish, the graffiti, the children, the thieves, the maddened. Each is rolled up into a prose poem reaching to his conclusion that London now is [pace Sinclair] also the London that has always been.\"</p> <p>Sexton also tied the biography of the city neatly to that of its author. \"In this work of imagination, Ackroyd has also given us his own autobiography, as indeed anybody does who shows us his own London. This is the book he has always been working towards or around, and sometimes away from. It seems all too weirdly apt that on the day he completed it, last November, he nearly died of a heart attack.\" </p> <p>Spooky. Sexton returned to the point in his conclusion. \"London: The Biography is from beginning to end, a self-portrait projected on to the town. So much becomes clear from the very first page. 'It is fleshy and voracious, grown fat upon its appetite for people and for food, for goods and drink; it consumes and excretes, maintained within a continual state of desire and greed.' It is Peter Ackroyd.\"</p> <p>Truly a rave, then, even if that final paragraph might tempt Ackroyd to consult his solicitors.</p>",

It shuns - even after the disasters of the Great Fire or the Blitz - the grand dream as solution: and where there is a small, mistaken dream, like the tower block, it soon shrugs it off. London believes in muddling through, making up its own destiny as it goes along. Kathryn Hughes, in the Sunday Telegraph, sat awkwardly on the fence, but echoed Sinclair's suggestion that the city's present was not captured with the force of its teeming past. \"Peter Ackroyd has written an episodically brilliant book. No one gets London - especially pungent, raucous, randy London - quite as well as he. The biography is a kind of love poem to the city which shaped Ackroyd's imagination and granted him one of the most distinguished literary careers of the late 20th century. Just what he makes of its present is not quite so clear.\" Roy Porter, in the Times, enjoyed the book and defended its eccentricities: \"One cannot but marvel at Ackroyd's erudition, his energy in marshalling minutiae, his ear for quotation, his flair for dazzling juxtapositions, his vibrant imagination and sheer exuberance. To aficionados of conventional 'biographies', Ackroyd's contrariness may be perplexing - thus we hear of the Tube before London's railways. But there is method in his madness, for he explains that London throbs with a multiplicity of 'times', independent of chronology, rather as geological unconformities crop out unpredictably at the surface.\" But Porter's conclusion worried me: \"As Ackroyd remarks, this is not a biography to be read doggedly from cover to cover. Put it by your bedside and open it at random. Like sticking a pin in the A to Z and going on a mystery visit, it's an exercise which will have its dull moments as well as its delights. But in that this idiosyncratic book only mirrors the unique city itself.\" A book best opened an random does not sound like a very good book. Only David Sexton, in the London Evening Standard, really seemed to adore it, and his enthusiasm was infectious. \"There are chapters and mini-chapters on a wonderful profusion of topics: the noise, the smell, the drinking, the eating, the crowds, the flowers, the fogs, the murderers, the suicides, the wells, the lost rivers, the beggars,the prisons, the gambling, the sexual licence, the fires, the accents, the executions, the immigrants, the suburbs, the lights, the bells, the rubbish, the graffiti, the children, the thieves, the maddened. Each is rolled up into a prose poem reaching to his conclusion that London now is [pace Sinclair] also the London that has always been.\" Sexton also tied the biography of the city neatly to that of its author. \"In this work of imagination, Ackroyd has also given us his own autobiography, as indeed anybody does who shows us his own London. This is the book he has always been working towards or around, and sometimes away from. It seems all too weirdly apt that on the day he completed it, last November, he nearly died of a heart attack.\" Spooky. Sexton returned to the point in his conclusion. \"London: The Biography is from beginning to end, a self-portrait projected on to the town. So much becomes clear from the very first page. 'It is fleshy and voracious, grown fat upon its appetite for people and for food, for goods and drink; it consumes and excretes, maintained within a continual state of desire and greed.' It is Peter Ackroyd.\" Truly a rave, then, even if that final paragraph might tempt Ackroyd to consult his solicitors.",

She is so confident that she has called her new book Stop Smoking in One Hour. </p> <p>Austin claims to stop 95% of smokers in this hour. I'm staring at the book cover - it shows a mouth being used as an ashtray, with fags and ash dumped unceremoniously between teeth. It is supposed to be a deterrent, but I find it sensual. </p> <p>The book teaches us how to hypnotise ourselves into kicking the habit. Austin admits it's less effective than having an expert hypnotise you. For one thing, you never know when you've managed to hypnotise yourself. </p> <p>She says hypnotism is so different from popular perception - there are no dangers, no peculiar feelings, just a sense of being relaxed. According to Austin, people cannot be hypnotised to do things they don't want to - so my ambivalence is a problem. </p> <p>A colleague told me that he visited a hypnotist for an hour and then stopped smoking for four years. He had no withdrawal effects. \"The strange thing was, my life was about as bad as it could be, everything was disintegrating, yet I still felt no desire to smoke. I didn't feel envy or panic or hostility when I smelled smoke; I simply thought, 'Isn't it funny, I used to do this thing.'\" </p> <p>Austin discovered hypnosis when she suffered hysterical amnesia after a car crash. She could remember yesterday but not the day before, and her life was in chaos. Eventually, she recovered her mind through hypnosis. She then did a course in hypnotherapy, discovered she was good at it, and built a career. She worked in Hollywood and Malaysia before returning to Britain and a Harley Street practice - still a fair distance from her Blackpool roots. She says she has always had an eye for a story, which is a nice word for self-publicity. </p> <p>Austin likes her analogies. She says I should imagine I'm a computer with a virus, and I am calling out the engineer. There is nothing magic about hypnosis. It's simply about winning over the subconscious. She tells me of a 91-year-old surgeon friend who has done 4,000 operations with patients under hypnosis. \"There are videos of him sawing someone's leg off and the woman's lying there singing!\" </p> <p>The session is split into half an hour's explanation and half an hour's hypnosis. She asks me to focus on a spot, then close my eyes, count back wards from 500, tighten and relax toes, calves, thighs, shoulders, face. </p> <p>Suddenly I'm desperate for it to work. I shut my eyes as fiercely as possible. I'm becoming seriously relaxed, mindlessly relaxed. \"You have now made one of the most important decisions of your life... Colin... to save your life, by giving up smoking, giving up polluting your lungs...\" </p> <p>Unfortunately, I'm not called Colin, and I close my eyes even harder so as not to giggle. Austin knows she's boobed and Colin becomes a stammered Simon. </p> <p>In a gentle monotone, she tells me of the many ways I'm corrupting the planet. She tells me to think instinctively of three substitutes for smoking. I list football, reading and sex. The sex bit seems to unnerve her and she never refers back to my substitutes. She asks the old, stinky, fag-addled me to step inside an imaginary 3ft television. \"How d'you look?\" I know she wants me to say gross, so I try to create as horrible a picture as possible. \"Not nice,\" I say. I replace fag-addled me with the fit, reformed me. \"How d'you look?\" \"Great!\" </p> <p>Who am I to disappoint Austin? She's spending time with me, and if I weren't a journalist I'd be spending a huge amount of money on her (\u00a3500 a throw). For a second the cynic gets the better of me: if you've saved up for ages for this one last-ditch attempt to quit, you're hardly going to walk out of the session and light up, are you? </p> <p>Austin says I'm suggestible, and I'm not quite sure how to take it. Suggestible tends to be used pejoratively - you may as well say gullible - but in the world of hypnosis, if you're suggestible you're as good as it gets - an ideal candidate. </p> <p>Austin brings me out of hypnosis. She doesn't click her fingers or say a magic word, she simply tells me to open my eyes, which I do because it would be churlish not to. </p> <p>When I tell her I don't think I was hypnotised but it was very nice thank you, she gives me a heard-it-all-before look. Anyway, she says, my eyes were flipping up and down at great speed, which can only happen if you're in a state of hypnosis or if you're Ann Widdecombe. Austin isn't about tricks and showmanship. </p> <p>\"OK, if you want to see a trick I'll show you one,\" she says. She asks me to place my arm out straight and push against her arm, placed above it.

      "body": "<p>When I was pregnant for the first time a \"breastfeeding counsellor\" came to our antenatal class to tell us that \"breast is best\". Given that a friend of mine had just told me breastfeeding was more agonising than giving birth, I felt compelled to ask: \"Will it hurt?\" \"Of course not,\" laughed the counsellor. \"It's what your boobs are designed for.\" She admitted there might be a little \"discomfort\" if the baby did not \"latch on\". But, she added, \"Many women even find it erotic.\" </p> <p>Sadly, according to Department of Health statistics, most new mothers do not agree. Each year in Britain 75,000 of us stop breastfeeding in the first week after our baby is born. This is not necessarily through choice. </p> <p>According to Robert Finch of the Department of Health's Infant Feeding Initiative (a scheme aiming to encourage women to breastfeed), \"Of those who give up in the first week, only 1% do so because they have breastfed for as long as they wanted.\" </p> <p>In the weeks following childbirth, breastfeeders continue to drop like flies: less than half of those who breastfeed immediately after their baby is born are sticking to it by the time the child is six weeks old. And no, this is not what we want. The vast majority (80%) who give up before their baby is four months old say they would have liked to continue for longer. </p> <p>So why do we stop? Most of us probably know that breastfeeding is good for babies: studies have shown that a breastfed baby is likely to be brighter, healthier and less prone to allergies than a formula-fed one. </p> <p>Women are less likely to get breast, ovarian and cervical cancers if they breastfeed and can (we are told) lose the pregnancy flab quicker that way. And if the thought of a stomach like Madonna's won't persuade us all to whip out our boobs, the message that breastfeeding is convenient and \"easy\" (nothing to sterilise, buy or remember) surely should. </p> <p>But it is not that simple. \"There are,\" says Finch, \"wide and varied reasons why women stop breastfeeding.\" One that will ring a bell for many new mothers is that breastfeeding is not always as easy as it looks. \"It may be natural,\" says Finch, \"but it's not instinctive.\" This seems to go against the antenatal message. Listen to any group of new mothers, and some will be saying how breastfeeding was not the idyll they had expected. We are, it seems, simply not prepared - psychologically as much as physically - for the difficulties that can arise when we try to do the \"natural\" thing. </p> <p>This was certainly my experience. I was told by midwives that on day three postpartum my boobs would swell to the size of watermelons and start gushing real milk instead of the gloopy colostrum that feeds the baby in its first few days. They showed me various positions. They gave me a breast pump. I waited with a growing sense of hysteria and inadequacy for the engorgement to happen. It never did. This did not mean that I could not breastfeed. It just caused unnecessary angst. </p> <p>Most of us learn something of the physiology of breastfeeding before we give birth. It goes roughly like this: when the baby is born, a hormone, prolactin, tells the cells in the breasts to start making milk; the baby's sucking then sends messages to the pituitary gland in the brain, which triggers the release of another hormone, oxytocin, which in turn makes the muscular walls of the milk-producing cells contract; this ejects the milk down the duct and out through the nipple. It is what they call \"supply and demand\". </p> <p>But it does not always work so smoothly. My friend Rachel gave birth to twins recently. Like me, she was reassured that her milk would \"come in\" (they said on day five). It didn't. \"I was distraught,\" she says. \"I spent several days in hospital with hungry and upset babies.\" When her milk supply still hadn't come in a few days later (like mine, it took a fortnight to become properly established), she had to start \"supplementary feeding\": that is, to breastfeed, then give her twins a bottle of formula. \"I was absolutely devastated,\" she says. \"I felt like a bad mother. I felt like I was feeding them junk. I cried for a week.\" </p> <p>This may sound extreme, but according to Eleanor Jackson, a breastfeeding counsellor, it is incredibly common: \"So many women feel like failures when breastfeeding goes wrong, and so often it's just a matter of confidence. Breastfeeding,\" she stresses, \"is a learned art.\" </p> <p>Government statistics bear this out. The chief reason we give up (48% of us) in those early months is \"insufficient milk supply\". We either believe or are told that our breasts are failing to produce enough milk. In reality, says Jackson, it is extremely rare for women to be physiologically unable to breastfeed (reasons for this may include breast reduction surgery that has damaged the glands or a retained placenta in the first week or so after birth). </p> <p>The problem is that breasts do not always look or feel like they are producing milk, and breastfed babies can guzzle frequently and voraciously. This can be alarming if you were expecting to gush milk and have a baby that takes efficient four-hourly feeds. Breastfed babies do not always gain weight in the same way as bottlefed babies, either. According to Jackson, \"There is a huge 'normal' weight range for breastfed babies.\" The health visitor's growth chart, then, can be worrying reading for a breastfeeding mother. When - as happened to me - a health visitor informs you that your baby has not gained enough weight and that you should \"top up\" with a bottle after each feed, it is easy to panic. My health visitor did not discuss my diet, my rest or how often I was feeding my three-month-old baby. Nor did she suggest places I could go for support. Instead, I was sent to the chemist, feeling I had failed when, with support, I could have taken measures to increase my milk supply. </p> <p>OK, so there are worse things in life than feeding your baby from a bottle. But if you are expecting your body to do it all automatically then setbacks can be profoundly undermining. \"I asked the midwife in my antenatal group whether I'd have enough milk for two,\" says Rachel. \"She told me, 'Nature's a marvellous thing - of course you will.' \" It was after the problems set in that a health visitor admitted to Rachel that: \"In all her time she'd only met one person with twins who'd been able to breastfeed exclusively. And she had two nannies.\" </p> <p>Of course, childbirth educators and health professionals do not want to put us off. But surely it would help if we were told beforehand that our breasts might not do what is expected of them; that it is common for boobs or ache, or block up, or get engorged, or nipples to crack; that our babies may not gain weight exactly as the chart says; and that in the first six weeks they may feed up to 12 times in 24 hours. To present us instead with a picture of erotic mother-infant bliss is, surely, setting us up for a fall? </p> <p>Janet Fyle, a midwifery policy adviser to the Royal College of Midwives, says midwives are not to blame: \"Midwives aren't raising expectations,\" she says. \"The expectations women have come from within. Midwives don't set women up; they give them information and, when difficulties arise, offer support, listening and reassurance.\" </p> <p>Wherever our expectations come from, it is clear that the support is not always there afterwards. Another friend of mine, Tracy, experienced severe, burning pain each time she fed her newborn. She was told by midwives, health visitors, breastfeeding counsellors and her GP that nothing was wrong. \"You're just the kind of person who wants things to be perfect,\" said one breastfeeding counsellor. Two months later, Tracy was diagnosed with thrush in her nipples. It cleared up with some cream, and she had no problems from then on. </p> <p>So yes, of course we need to be encouraged; and yes, we need to be told how valuable breastfeeding is. But we also need to know - in advance - how \"normal\" problems are. Antenatal realism might not solve the whole breastfeeding issue - it is too complicated for that. But it might help countless women feel better about themselves, whether they choose to continue or not. And that cannot be a bad thing, can it?</p>",

Janet Fyle, a midwifery policy adviser to the Royal College of Midwives, says midwives are not to blame: \"Midwives aren't raising expectations,\" she says. \"The expectations women have come from within. Midwives don't set women up; they give them information and, when difficulties arise, offer support, listening and reassurance.\" Wherever our expectations come from, it is clear that the support is not always there afterwards. Another friend of mine, Tracy, experienced severe, burning pain each time she fed her newborn. She was told by midwives, health visitors, breastfeeding counsellors and her GP that nothing was wrong. \"You're just the kind of person who wants things to be perfect,\" said one breastfeeding counsellor. Two months later, Tracy was diagnosed with thrush in her nipples. It cleared up with some cream, and she had no problems from then on. So yes, of course we need to be encouraged; and yes, we need to be told how valuable breastfeeding is. But we also need to know - in advance - how \"normal\" problems are. Antenatal realism might not solve the whole breastfeeding issue - it is too complicated for that. But it might help countless women feel better about themselves, whether they choose to continue or not. And that cannot be a bad thing, can it?",

My optician has only ever seen four patients who have had the treatment, two of whom were very short-sighted and had their vision improved rather than completely corrected, one whose sight was restored to perfection, and one who regained perfect focus, but with some peripheral blurring. However, my optician stressed that these might have been atypical cases. </p> <p>His only reservation concerned the \"experimental\" nature of the procedure; having only been practised for around 30 years, the treatment may have unknown long-term effects. Do you know of any statistics on the overall success rate for this operation? And is there a professional body I could contact for impartial advice on the matter? </p> <p><strong>A. </strong>The most commonly used technique is called LASIK. A thin flap of outer corneal tissue is lifted up using a tiny instrument like a carpenter's plane. The laser is directed at the inner part of the cornea and the outer flap then flipped back into place. There are no stitches, minimal or no discomfort after the operation, and rapid recovery of vision with hardly any haziness. Up to 60% of those treated won't need glasses or lenses at all after the operation. There is no standard list of professionals offering LASIK, but an opthalmologist whom I asked said that Optimax, the largest organisation offering LASIK in this country, appears to meet the required standards. </p> <p><strong> Avoiding scars</strong></p> <p> <strong> Q. </strong> I have a basal cell carcinoma on the end of my nose. I am trying to find out the very best method of treatment with the least scarring. The only treatment available around here (Brighton, East Sussex area) is scraping, which will leave quite a scar. Would laser treatment (available in London) leave less of a scar and be effective? All my local enquiries on this matter seem to be hitting a brick wall of \"don't know\". </p> <p><strong>A. </strong> Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), also known as rodent ulcers, need to be removed, because they tend to enlarge and eat away at surrounding tissues. The British Association of Dermatologists recommends seeing a specialist for BCCs on and around the nose, rather than letting your GP remove them, because they tend to recur unless fully destroyed. They can be cut off, scraped (curettage), or burnt off or destroyed using laser or radiotherapy. All methods, including laser, may leave a scar, but it's usually minimal and far less unsightly than an untreated BCC. Your local dermatologist should be able to discuss the pros and cons with you, but you could get a second opinion from a dermatologist or plastic surgeon before going ahead with treatment. Your GP really should help you find one. Remember to use sunblock in future and limit exposure to the sun - BCCs are commoner in fair-skinned people and related to sunburn and time spent in the sun. </p> <p><strong> Less fat, more sugar</strong></p> <p> <strong> Q.</strong> When I buy low-fat desserts, such as custard, I note on the carton that although the fat content is low, the sugar content is very high. Is it a false economy then to feel happy to enjoy liberal helpings of 95% fat-free custard - does all that sugar become fat, or can you really enjoy it? </p> <p><strong>A. </strong>Everything you eat or drink in excess turns to fat. Sugar is a carbohydrate and contains the same number of calories per gram as protein, which has about half as many calories per gram as fat. So low-fat, high-sugar custard will have fewer calories than high-fat, high-sugar custard. You can reduce calories further by eating low-fat custard with artifical sweetener, but it would probably taste so disgusting that you wouldn't want to bother. Personally, I'd rather eat a smaller amount of proper food than gorge myself on nasty substitutes. </p> <p>\u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help.

A virus that puts you flat on your back for at least a week, with a raging fever, sore throat, hacking cough, aching muscles and such weakness that using the TV remote control is too much effort? A virus that, if you already have a medical problem or have reached retirement age, can land you in hospital? Now is the time for influenza vaccinations, and the start of the season of flu surveillance by doctors in the northern hemisphere, who are keeping their fingers crossed against another epidemic. </p> <p>But however debilitating the illness - and once you've had it, you never again confuse it with a bad cold - there is only enough vaccine in Britain for 11m people. So while some employers offer it to their workforce to avoid the risk of everyone taking flu leave, most healthy people may find it tough to get vaccinated. The government intends the vaccination to be given free only to people aged 65 and over and those at high risk: a category including anyone with a serious medical condition, such as diabetes, chronic respiratory disease (including asthma) or kidney or heart disease, and those with impaired immunity. </p> <p>The vaccine will also be given to people in residential or nursing homes because it is in these vulnerable and enclosed communities that flu - which is spread by droplets, for example in coughing - wreaks havoc most rapidly. This is the first year that the government has lowered the minimum age for free vaccination from 75 to 65. </p> <p>\"The main reason for preventing flu is to prevent the complications of flu,\" says a spokeswoman at the Public Health Laboratory Service in London. \"The people being targeted by the Department of Health are those at high risk of bronchitis and pneumonia, which are the serious complications.\" </p> <p>A new vaccine against flu must be given each year because the flu viruses cunningly change at least annually. Each vaccine is made from killed strains of the three main flu viruses, decided upon by the World Health Organisation each February after examining several thousand influenza viruses from its laboratories in London, Atlanta and Melbourne. But there is still a slight risk of epidemics because the viruses can mutate in mid-season. </p> <p>Production of the vaccine starts in March, and GPs are encouraged to place their orders in the summer. But in an ideal world, wouldn't it be worth everyone getting vaccinated? \"It is worth having a flu jab if you are a fit, healthy adult,\" says Dr Joe Neary, a GP and chair of the clinical and special projects network for the Royal College of General Practitioners. </p> <p>Neary cites a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1995 which compares the amount of sick leave taken by two groups of fit working adults (there were more than 400 in each). One group had been vaccinated, the other had not. Those given the vaccine took almost half the amount of sick leave and had a quarter of the the rate of sore throats, fevers and coughs. The economic savings of vaccination were modest (about \u00a330 per person), but the health benefits were arguably more significant. </p> <p>\"You can look at whether you'd benefit from a flu jab in the same way as having a gamble,\" says Neary. \"The stake is the cost of the vaccine\" - around \u00a37.50 from some chemists - \"and its side effects are a sore arm and sometimes flu-like symptoms for a few days. Only people who have a serious allergic response to eggs shouldn't have the vaccine. The odds on whether you would get flu depend on your job - there's a higher risk if you touch lots of people who might be infected. </p> <p>\"The vaccine also offers only between 80-90% protection - but if you do get flu after being vaccinated, the chances are you'd be able to struggle on with it. The payout is that you don't get what is a very incapacitating illness that can last two weeks.\" </p> <p>But Neary accepts that unless more vaccine is produced, then government priorities are right. \"You can't afford to do everything for everyone. For some people flu is an inconvenience, but for others with impaired health it is life-threatening.\" </p> <p>Neary pays for his own flu jab every year, despite being able to justify having one on the NHS because the health service virtually collapses when its staff get flu. \"It's just that when my patients who aren't eligible for a free jab ask for one, I wouldn't be able to look them in the face if I didn't pay for my own vaccination,\" he says. </p> <p>\u0095 Further information is avaiable from <a href=\"http://www.phls.co.uk/seasonal/influenza\">www.phls.co.uk/seasonal/influenza,</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk\">www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk</a>.</p>",

But in an ideal world, wouldn't it be worth everyone getting vaccinated? \"It is worth having a flu jab if you are a fit, healthy adult,\" says Dr Joe Neary, a GP and chair of the clinical and special projects network for the Royal College of General Practitioners. Neary cites a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1995 which compares the amount of sick leave taken by two groups of fit working adults (there were more than 400 in each). One group had been vaccinated, the other had not. Those given the vaccine took almost half the amount of sick leave and had a quarter of the the rate of sore throats, fevers and coughs. The economic savings of vaccination were modest (about \u00a330 per person), but the health benefits were arguably more significant. \"You can look at whether you'd benefit from a flu jab in the same way as having a gamble,\" says Neary. \"The stake is the cost of the vaccine\" - around \u00a37.50 from some chemists - \"and its side effects are a sore arm and sometimes flu-like symptoms for a few days. Only people who have a serious allergic response to eggs shouldn't have the vaccine. The odds on whether you would get flu depend on your job - there's a higher risk if you touch lots of people who might be infected. \"The vaccine also offers only between 80-90% protection - but if you do get flu after being vaccinated, the chances are you'd be able to struggle on with it. The payout is that you don't get what is a very incapacitating illness that can last two weeks.\" But Neary accepts that unless more vaccine is produced, then government priorities are right. \"You can't afford to do everything for everyone. For some people flu is an inconvenience, but for others with impaired health it is life-threatening.\" Neary pays for his own flu jab every year, despite being able to justify having one on the NHS because the health service virtually collapses when its staff get flu. \"It's just that when my patients who aren't eligible for a free jab ask for one, I wouldn't be able to look them in the face if I didn't pay for my own vaccination,\" he says. \u0095 Further information is avaiable from www.phls.co.uk/seasonal/influenza, and www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk.",

Sir Jeremy, who is chairman of the new channel, said\" \"There are less arts programmes on British television than there were 20 years ago, yet the huge hunger for the arts grows apace.\" Artsworld, whose investors include the Guardian Media Group, will be available on Sky Digital for a \u00a36 monthly subscription fee. It will offer five hours of programming a night, which will be repeated the following afternoon. There will be a nightly arts magazine programme, followed by an evening of performances, documentaries and other cultural shows. The success of Tate Modern, Billy Elliott and Classic FM showed there is a great demand for culture, Sir Jeremy said. The channel, which launches on December 2, aims initially to attract a modest \"few hundred thousand\" subscribers. A number of familiar names will be associated with the channel, with Sheena McDonald, Richard Coles, Charlie Lee-Potter and Tim Marlow presenting the daily magazine show Focus. Clive James is to interview the Australian poet Les Murray, while Bel Mooney will present a show in which guests talk about pictures that have influenced them. Artsworld, which has signed an exclusive three-year deal with Italian broadcaster RAI to show opera and ballet from Milan's La Scala, has said that 30-40% of its programmes will be original commissions.",

And the BBC triumphantly declared a victory in the TV news wars, with its first 10pm news bulletin pulling in almost six million viewers. BBC1 controller Lorraine Heggessey said: \"I couldn't have had a better first night\" But in an unsurprising war of words, ITV insisted it had won the battle with its powerful combination of Millionaire and Coronation Street guaranteeing it the higher audience share on the night. More than 15 million tuned into Coronation Street to catch up on the aftermath of the Freshco siege and shooting. That delivered ITV a huge 63 per cent share of the audience, boosting its overall peak time viewing share between 7pm and 10.30pm to 38%. The BBC, which rolled out the first episode of the last series of one Foot in the Grave and the first episode in a new series of The Royle Family, won 32.7% for peak time, according to unofficial overnights. Grumpy Victor Meldrew, a viewers' favourite, pulled in 10.2 million, pulling off a rare feat for a BBC1 show - beating Millionaire. The Chris Tarrant quiz show came a narrow second with an audience of 9.4m - share of 36 per cent share - for the half-hour it went head-to-head with One Foot in the Grave. In its second half, Millionaire climbed to a quarter-hour high of 11.1m and averaged 10.2m or a 39% overall share. That was enough to give ITV a comfortable lead over BBC1's The Royle Family, which nonetheless turned in best ever figures of 8.4m or 32% share of viewing.

BBC director of television Mark Thompson said: \"Although it's very early days in a very long game, it is very encouraring to see that a significant number of viewers will turn to a Ten O'Clock News.\" BBC director general Greg Dyke, who persuaded the board of governors to rubber-stamp the lightning change to the TV schedules, will have been pleased with the performance of its new-look schedule. In the 90 minutes after 9pm, BBC1 pulled in a massive 8.2m viewers, or a 33%, share - 10 percentage points up on last Monday's audience of 5.1m.

      "body": "<p><strong>George Weah: Liberian girl, or badly-treated genius? </strong> </p> <p>Last night George Weah claimed that Manchester City manager Joe Royle showed him \"a lack of respect\" while he was at Maine Road. Lee Calvert, for one, is not impressed. \"Who the hell does Weah think he is?\" he says, attacking the former world, European and African footballer of the year. \"I am a life long Oldham Athletic fan and still have a very soft spot for Joe Royle, and anyone who knows anything about him knows that he is in no way \"dishonest and disrespectful\". In fact, if you ask anyone in football they will tell you he is one of the most honest and honourable men in the game.</p> <p>\"Methinks that maybe Weah expected to play all season in what he saw as a second rate side and finish his career as a hero. Unfortunately football does not quite work like that you mardy-arse! I'm sure Joe treated him no different to any other player, and they aren't moaning.\"</p> <p>Andrew Parker agrees. \"George Weah: what a moaning, spoilt, little rich boy,\" he says. \"Let's face it. He doesn't like Manchester, and who can blame him. It's grim, it rains all the time, and Alex Ferguson works there. I'd much rather be in Milan sitting in the town square somewhere drinking a cappuccino. Still, we can't have everything we want, can we now?\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Paul Act has a different suggestion. \"After reading about Mr Weah leaving Man City, I believe that he should drop down a couple of divisions and join Uncle Sam at Cardiff City! All the boyz will make him welcome and we will take him out for a couple of pints down The NIN and then for a kebab down Caroling Street, I'm sure we will make him feel at home!\" Well, down-town Cardiff could pass for war-torn Liberia on a particularly heavy Saturday night, perhaps...</p> <p><strong>Hoddle or Howard or Harry? More thoughts on the vacant England manager's job</strong></p> <p>Another day, another batch of emails about the vacant England manager's job - including one, surprisingly, from a glenn_hoddle. \"Are you interested in playing eleven a side football?\" he writes from his hotmail account. \"I'm looking for local guys to play regular eleven a side football for a team (nothing too serious). I urgently need new players as the team frankly at the moment is crap.</p> <p>\"Players get free use of the local gym, and I can get you a discounted rate at an exclusive golf course.

      "bodyText": "George Weah: Liberian girl, or badly-treated genius? Last night George Weah claimed that Manchester City manager Joe Royle showed him \"a lack of respect\" while he was at Maine Road. Lee Calvert, for one, is not impressed. \"Who the hell does Weah think he is?\" he says, attacking the former world, European and African footballer of the year. \"I am a life long Oldham Athletic fan and still have a very soft spot for Joe Royle, and anyone who knows anything about him knows that he is in no way \"dishonest and disrespectful\". In fact, if you ask anyone in football they will tell you he is one of the most honest and honourable men in the game. \"Methinks that maybe Weah expected to play all season in what he saw as a second rate side and finish his career as a hero. Unfortunately football does not quite work like that you mardy-arse! I'm sure Joe treated him no different to any other player, and they aren't moaning.\" Andrew Parker agrees. \"George Weah: what a moaning, spoilt, little rich boy,\" he says. \"Let's face it. He doesn't like Manchester, and who can blame him. It's grim, it rains all the time, and Alex Ferguson works there. I'd much rather be in Milan sitting in the town square somewhere drinking a cappuccino. Still, we can't have everything we want, can we now?\" Meanwhile Paul Act has a different suggestion. \"After reading about Mr Weah leaving Man City, I believe that he should drop down a couple of divisions and join Uncle Sam at Cardiff City! All the boyz will make him welcome and we will take him out for a couple of pints down The NIN and then for a kebab down Caroling Street, I'm sure we will make him feel at home!\" Well, down-town Cardiff could pass for war-torn Liberia on a particularly heavy Saturday night, perhaps... Hoddle or Howard or Harry? More thoughts on the vacant England manager's job Another day, another batch of emails about the vacant England manager's job - including one, surprisingly, from a glenn_hoddle. \"Are you interested in playing eleven a side football?\" he writes from his hotmail account. \"I'm looking for local guys to play regular eleven a side football for a team (nothing too serious). I urgently need new players as the team frankly at the moment is crap. \"Players get free use of the local gym, and I can get you a discounted rate at an exclusive golf course. We even have a sponsor who funds us to travel abroad to play competitive games, but frankly if we keep playing as craply as we do at the moment it'll just be embarrassing and we'll have to knock that on the head.

Mark Oliver and Julian Glover explain.",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>What is the core issue?</b> <br> The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, and the former paymaster general, Geoffrey Robinson are in dispute about who made the running in the conversations that culminated in a loan of \u00a3373,000 from Mr Robinson to Mr Mandelson, allowing the latter to buy a house in London's trendy Notting Hill. <p><b>What do they agree about?</b><br> What is not contested is that the pair had dinner at Mr Robinson's penthouse flat in May 1996, and discussed Mr Mandelson's desire to find better London accommodation. Mr Mandelson denies he angled for the loan or forced Mr Robinson to give it to him. Mr Robinson wants it on the record that he was not trying push the money on the minister - arguably prime minister Tony Blair's closest confidant - in a bid to help his own political career. The affair prompted Mr Mandelson's resignation as trade and industry secretary in December 1998, shortly followed by Mr Robinson's resignation. </p> <p><b>What is Mr Robinson's version of events?</b><br> \"We met, he brought the whole matter of his house up, and the rather straitened circumstances in which he felt he lived... He said he would like to buy somewhere, he mentioned Notting Hill, it was clear that was what he was most interested in, but he didn't have anybody who would help him... I replied that I was financially well placed and might be able to help if that was what he wanted. At that point nothing further was said. I imagine he was mulling the situation over in his own mind. But the next morning at 9am, the phone rang and it was Peter saying quite openly, 'Would you really help me buy a house', to which I replied, 'Yes, if that's what you want.' \"</p> <p><b>How has Mr Mandelson responded?</b><br> He has described the suggestion that he forced Mr Robinson into giving him a loan, or went to dinner with him for this express purpose, as \"ridiculous\". Mr Mandelson says: \"As a friend of many years standing, he volunteered his financial help if needed. I later took him up on his offer and I was grateful to him... I gave a full, faithful, and factual account to the House of Commons standards committee, as did Geoffrey himself. They accepted it and I regard the matter as closed.\" </p> <p><b>What did Mr Mandelson say to the Commons standards and privileges committee on May 18 1999?</b><br> He said: \"I did not go to him [Robinson] with the intention of asking him to loan me some money.

      "bodyText": "What is the core issue? The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, and the former paymaster general, Geoffrey Robinson are in dispute about who made the running in the conversations that culminated in a loan of \u00a3373,000 from Mr Robinson to Mr Mandelson, allowing the latter to buy a house in London's trendy Notting Hill. What do they agree about? What is not contested is that the pair had dinner at Mr Robinson's penthouse flat in May 1996, and discussed Mr Mandelson's desire to find better London accommodation. Mr Mandelson denies he angled for the loan or forced Mr Robinson to give it to him. Mr Robinson wants it on the record that he was not trying push the money on the minister - arguably prime minister Tony Blair's closest confidant - in a bid to help his own political career. The affair prompted Mr Mandelson's resignation as trade and industry secretary in December 1998, shortly followed by Mr Robinson's resignation. What is Mr Robinson's version of events? \"We met, he brought the whole matter of his house up, and the rather straitened circumstances in which he felt he lived... He said he would like to buy somewhere, he mentioned Notting Hill, it was clear that was what he was most interested in, but he didn't have anybody who would help him... I replied that I was financially well placed and might be able to help if that was what he wanted. At that point nothing further was said. I imagine he was mulling the situation over in his own mind. But the next morning at 9am, the phone rang and it was Peter saying quite openly, 'Would you really help me buy a house', to which I replied, 'Yes, if that's what you want.' \" How has Mr Mandelson responded? He has described the suggestion that he forced Mr Robinson into giving him a loan, or went to dinner with him for this express purpose, as \"ridiculous\". Mr Mandelson says: \"As a friend of many years standing, he volunteered his financial help if needed. I later took him up on his offer and I was grateful to him... I gave a full, faithful, and factual account to the House of Commons standards committee, as did Geoffrey himself. They accepted it and I regard the matter as closed.\" What did Mr Mandelson say to the Commons standards and privileges committee on May 18 1999? He said: \"I did not go to him [Robinson] with the intention of asking him to loan me some money. I told him I was looking for a house or a flat. He asked how I was going to pay for it. I said I was going to sell my property and my mother would help. He said, 'Well, if you need any help you know I will help'.\" Is Mr Robinson calling Mr Mandelson a liar? Yes and no. Yes, in that he says Mr Mandelson solicited the loan, rather than simply accepted it. No, in that he agrees with Mr Mandelson that he first suggested the idea of lending the money. The Daily Mail used the word \"lied\" in one of its headlines. Mr Robinson says he does not agree with this and that he thinks Mandelson should not resign again. Why does any of this matter? Because Mr Robinson's new version of events is, arguably, at odds with Mr Mandelson's statement to the Commons committee. This is important for two reasons, both related to the impression it gives of Mr Mandelson having lied. The first reason is that Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary standards commissioner, is likely to reopen her file on the affair. She may conclude that the Northern Ireland secretary acted improperly. The second reason is that Mr Mandelson's speedy rehabilitation - he returned to the cabinet just 10 months after resigning - was made possible by the fact that he appeared not to have sought the loan. Had Mr Robinson's version of events been known at the time, it would have been tricky for the prime minister to reappoint his friend. The impression of sharp practice is hard to avoid. Does the affair have any wider significance for Tony Blair? In his memoir, An Unconventional Minister, Mr Robinson labels Mr Mandelson a \"divisive and destabilising figure\" who caused rows between Mr Blair and chancellor Gordon Brown. He says: \"It is, in my opinion, something he should control, it is something the prime minister should help him control, and I believe the administration of his government would be more effective if he was able to do so.\" Yesterday, the education secretary David Blunkett condemned Mr Robinson for \"self-indulgent\" sniping at Mr Mandelson, challenging the businessman to reveal how much he had made from the serialisation of his book, and donate it to the Labour party or a charity. How damaging is this affair to Mr Mandelson? Mr Mandelson was politically damaged when the affair broke because he had kept the loan a secret from Mr Blair and had not been forthcoming to his building society when he applied for a further \u00a3150,000 loan. But he has since clawed his way back to one of the top jobs in the cabinet. Today, there are renewed calls for Mr Mandelson's resignation but he is nothing if not a survivor.

As paymaster general, and one of Gordon Brown's Treasury colleagues, he proposed schemes for intervening both in Rover and the coal industry which the arch-New Labourite then at Trade and Industry could not fully accept.

The Mephistophelian depiction of his enemy, bumbling and even well-intentioned though it affects to be, thus reaches a nadir of malignity. Also of untruth. The notion that Blair needs Mandelson to tell him what to think about Europe is as fatuous as the parallel insinuation that any minister who objects to a decision fixed up between Blair and Brown is, outrageously, \"reopening\" an issue.</p> <p>This, I think, is the harbinger of something bigger. While Blair doesn't have to be told what his Europe policy should be, undermining Mandelson is a sure way of making that policy harder to carry forward.

Y una de cada cuatro fumadoras ya ten\u00eda adici\u00f3n al tabaco cuando cumpli\u00f3 los catorce a\u00f1os. Entre los hombres de quince a dieciocho a\u00f1os hay un quince por ciento de fumadores.

Y la misma Uni\u00f3n Europea tambi\u00e9n destina m\u00e1s de mil millones de euros a subvencionar el cultivo de tabaco. En Espa\u00f1a el Gobierno declara su inter\u00e9s en hacer campa\u00f1as contra el tabaco. Pero el Estado espa\u00f1ol tambi\u00e9n tiene otros intereses en el tabaco: es el propietario del ochenta por ciento de la empresa que transforma el setenta por ciento de la producci\u00f3n nacional. </p> <p>Un grupo de alumnos de la escuela S\u00fanion, de Barcelona, se re\u00fanen para hablar de tabaco. </p> <p> <strong> Por qu\u00e9 fuman los j\u00f3venes? Por qu\u00e9 cada vez m\u00e1s pronto? Fumas t\u00fa? </strong></p> <p><strong>Marc Nuez (14 a\u00f1os): </strong> Los j\u00f3venes fuman porque fuman los amigos. Yo empec\u00e9 a fumar el verano pasado. Todos los amigos fumaban y me dec\u00edan que lo probara. Al final lo prob\u00e9 y me enganch\u00e9. De momento no me he planteado dejarlo. </p> <p> <strong> Merc\u00e8 Pardo (14 a\u00f1os): </strong> Los j\u00f3venes empiezan a fumar cada vez m\u00e1s pronto por presi\u00f3n social. Fumar queda bien. El que fuma parece mayor, m\u00e1s atractivo y m\u00e1s fuerte. Yo fumo espor\u00e1dicamente pero puedo vivir sin fumar. Prefiero no engancharme, porque ahora parece atractivo pero despu\u00e9s, pasada la adolescencia, es un palo. </p> <p> <strong> Amaya D\u00edaz (14 a\u00f1os): </strong> Los m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes ven a los alumnos del curso superior que fuman y ellos tambi\u00e9n se apuntan. Por eso los fumadores son cada vez m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes. Yo tambi\u00e9n fumo. El a\u00f1o pasado fumaba mucho porque mis padres me prohib\u00edan fumar. Ahora ya no me lo prohiben y fumo menos. </p> <p> <strong> Mar\u00eda Sais (12 a\u00f1os): </strong> Los j\u00f3venes creen que si fuman son m\u00e1s importantes. Muchos de mis amigos fuman. Yo lo he probado pero no me ha gustado. </p> <p> <strong> La Uni\u00f3n Europea decidi\u00f3 prohibir la publicidad de tabaco a partir del a\u00f1o 2001. Sin embargo, el Tribunal Europeo de Justicia ha anulado esta decisi\u00f3n. Crees que se deber\u00eda prohibir la publicidad de tabaco? </strong></p> <p><strong>Marc: </strong> La publicidad es enga\u00f1osa. Venden el tabaco como algo bueno cuando en realidad no lo es, pues el tabaco mata. Pero yo no prohibir\u00eda la publicidad de tabaco. Al final la gente si quiere fuma. </p> <p> <strong> Merc\u00e8: </strong> No. La publicidad influye pero no obliga. La mejor prevenci\u00f3n es informar. Si tiene mucha informaci\u00f3n puede llegar a la conclusi\u00f3n de que no es bueno fumar. De este modo el joven puede escoger. Tampoco se puede pretender convencer a los j\u00f3venes con imposiciones. </p> <p> <strong> Amaya: </strong> Yo obligar\u00eda a los anunciantes a poner una advertencia de forma muy visible en sus anuncios. La publicidad influye pero si uno no quiere no fuma. </p> <p> <strong> Clara Corbella (14 a\u00f1os): </strong> Entonces es como decir: \"Compra. El tabaco mata\". Las campa\u00f1as contra el tabaco no sirven para nada. Hay muchas charlas sobre el tema, pero muchos j\u00f3venes dicen: \"Yo paso de esto. Fumo porque quiero\". Es para ellos un signo de superioridad. La \u00faltima decisi\u00f3n depende de uno mismo. </p> <p> <strong> La Uni\u00f3n Europea subvenciona al mismo tiempo las campa\u00f1as contra el tabaquismo y plantaciones de tabaco. C\u00f3mo explicas esta contradicci\u00f3n? </strong> </p> <p><strong>Marc: </strong> En realidad el Estado no tiene intenci\u00f3n de que no fumen los j\u00f3venes. Yo, por ejemplo, tengo catorce a\u00f1os y no tengo problemas para entrar en un estanco y comprar un paquete de cigarrillos. Subir el precio del paquete, como han hecho en Estados Unidos, tampoco ser\u00eda una soluci\u00f3n. Yo pago 310 pesetas por un paquete de tabaco en el estanco. Y por la misma marca los vendedores ambulantes del metro cobran doscientas cincuenta pesetas. Si suben los impuestos ir\u00e9 m\u00e1s a menudo a los pasillos del metro a comprar tabaco ilegal. No conozco el tema muy bien, pero me han dicho que el peligro de fumar no es el tabaco sino los productos que a\u00f1aden para hacer los cigarrillos, como alquitr\u00e1n y nicotina. Quiz\u00e1s lo mejor ser\u00eda no a\u00f1adir estos productos. </p> <p> <strong> Merc\u00e8: </strong> Existen muchos intereses econ\u00f3micos. En realidad el Estado no quiere que la gente deje de fumar. Hay muchas personas que hacen dinero con esto. El Estado, por ejemplo, cobra impuestos con la venta del tabaco. </p> <p> <strong> Clara: </strong> Yo invertir\u00eda m\u00e1s dinero en investigar c\u00f3mo el tabaco puede ser menos perjudicial para la salud. De este modo la gente podr\u00eda seguir fumando pero sin hacerse tanto da\u00f1o. <br></p> <p><strong> Glosario/Glossary</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> apuntarse </strong> to join (in) </p> <p><strong> una charla </strong> a discussion, chat </p> <p><strong> dejarlo </strong> to give it up </p> <p><strong> engancharse </strong> to become addicted </p> <p><strong> un estanco </strong> shop with licence to sell tobacco and stamps </p> <p><strong> es un palo </strong> it's a pain </p> <p><strong> fumar habitualmente </strong> to smoke regularly </p> <p><strong> perjudicial </strong> harmful </p> <p><strong> pretender </strong> to try to </p> <p><strong> queda bien </strong> it looks good</p>",

Fumar queda bien. El que fuma parece mayor, m\u00e1s atractivo y m\u00e1s fuerte. Yo fumo espor\u00e1dicamente pero puedo vivir sin fumar. Prefiero no engancharme, porque ahora parece atractivo pero despu\u00e9s, pasada la adolescencia, es un palo. Amaya D\u00edaz (14 a\u00f1os): Los m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes ven a los alumnos del curso superior que fuman y ellos tambi\u00e9n se apuntan. Por eso los fumadores son cada vez m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes. Yo tambi\u00e9n fumo. El a\u00f1o pasado fumaba mucho porque mis padres me prohib\u00edan fumar. Ahora ya no me lo prohiben y fumo menos. Mar\u00eda Sais (12 a\u00f1os): Los j\u00f3venes creen que si fuman son m\u00e1s importantes. Muchos de mis amigos fuman. Yo lo he probado pero no me ha gustado. La Uni\u00f3n Europea decidi\u00f3 prohibir la publicidad de tabaco a partir del a\u00f1o 2001. Sin embargo, el Tribunal Europeo de Justicia ha anulado esta decisi\u00f3n. Crees que se deber\u00eda prohibir la publicidad de tabaco? Marc: La publicidad es enga\u00f1osa. Venden el tabaco como algo bueno cuando en realidad no lo es, pues el tabaco mata. Pero yo no prohibir\u00eda la publicidad de tabaco. Al final la gente si quiere fuma. Merc\u00e8: No. La publicidad influye pero no obliga. La mejor prevenci\u00f3n es informar. Si tiene mucha informaci\u00f3n puede llegar a la conclusi\u00f3n de que no es bueno fumar. De este modo el joven puede escoger. Tampoco se puede pretender convencer a los j\u00f3venes con imposiciones. Amaya: Yo obligar\u00eda a los anunciantes a poner una advertencia de forma muy visible en sus anuncios. La publicidad influye pero si uno no quiere no fuma. Clara Corbella (14 a\u00f1os): Entonces es como decir: \"Compra. El tabaco mata\". Las campa\u00f1as contra el tabaco no sirven para nada. Hay muchas charlas sobre el tema, pero muchos j\u00f3venes dicen: \"Yo paso de esto. Fumo porque quiero\". Es para ellos un signo de superioridad. La \u00faltima decisi\u00f3n depende de uno mismo. La Uni\u00f3n Europea subvenciona al mismo tiempo las campa\u00f1as contra el tabaquismo y plantaciones de tabaco. C\u00f3mo explicas esta contradicci\u00f3n? Marc: En realidad el Estado no tiene intenci\u00f3n de que no fumen los j\u00f3venes. Yo, por ejemplo, tengo catorce a\u00f1os y no tengo problemas para entrar en un estanco y comprar un paquete de cigarrillos. Subir el precio del paquete, como han hecho en Estados Unidos, tampoco ser\u00eda una soluci\u00f3n. Yo pago 310 pesetas por un paquete de tabaco en el estanco. Y por la misma marca los vendedores ambulantes del metro cobran doscientas cincuenta pesetas. Si suben los impuestos ir\u00e9 m\u00e1s a menudo a los pasillos del metro a comprar tabaco ilegal. No conozco el tema muy bien, pero me han dicho que el peligro de fumar no es el tabaco sino los productos que a\u00f1aden para hacer los cigarrillos, como alquitr\u00e1n y nicotina. Quiz\u00e1s lo mejor ser\u00eda no a\u00f1adir estos productos. Merc\u00e8: Existen muchos intereses econ\u00f3micos. En realidad el Estado no quiere que la gente deje de fumar. Hay muchas personas que hacen dinero con esto. El Estado, por ejemplo, cobra impuestos con la venta del tabaco. Clara: Yo invertir\u00eda m\u00e1s dinero en investigar c\u00f3mo el tabaco puede ser menos perjudicial para la salud. De este modo la gente podr\u00eda seguir fumando pero sin hacerse tanto da\u00f1o. Glosario/Glossary apuntarse to join (in) una charla a discussion, chat dejarlo to give it up engancharse to become addicted un estanco shop with licence to sell tobacco and stamps es un palo it's a pain fumar habitualmente to smoke regularly perjudicial harmful pretender to try to queda bien it looks good",

Colne Times The great escape Police are urging members of the public to be on the lookout for a flock of exotic birds after two parrots escaped from their owners' houses in north Shropshire. They are worried that a colony of parrots will breed in the wild from the African greys who fled their roosts in Wem and Whixhall within a week of each other. \"We are concerned that if we don't catch them quickly enough we might have a colony of parrots living wild in the Wem area,\" said Inspector Martin Whitelegg.

I initially asked him if there were any big, black dogs in his house or indeed in the local area. He told me that his father's dogs were in kennels that week, and that he wasn't aware of any other dogs nearby. He seemed rather surprised when I told him what I had seen but hopefully he believed me. I am interested to know if anyone else has spotted a black cat in the area opposite Oak Hill Wood. I would love to hear from anyone who can solve the mystery! Claire Banks, Stroud Gloucestershire Echo",

      "bodyText": "How many beans does Jean Tiberi have, and when will he decide to spill them? The embattled mayor of Paris, kicked out of his party last week for rejecting its decision to appoint a new candidate for the 2001 local elections, is now a fearsome loose cannon in French politics. Few would make any great claims of originality or vision for the diminutive grey-haired Corsican, a Gaullist RPR (Rassemblement pour la R\u00e9publique) party militant since practically the first hour and Jacques Chirac's loyal lieutenant at Paris town hall during the 18 years the president spent there as mayor. Handpicked by Chirac to succeed him after the 1995 presidential poll, Tiberi has proved a competent if uninspired mayor, getting things done in the capital with energy and commitment but lacking the stature - both physical and ideological - that Parisians would like to see in their civic leader. Inevitably, Tiberi has also got himself caught up in a few corruption scandals. He came under fire for allowing his children to occupy big council-owned apartments in chic Left Bank streets for knock-down rents. His son, once employed by Air France, was paid a million francs by the airline over three years while he was acting as a ministerial aid. Tiberi's wife faces a retrial over a now infamous 36-page report that she wrote for one of her husband's close RPR allies in a Gaullist-run local council outside Paris. Xavi\u00e8re Tiberi was paid \u00a320,000 for the report, which turned out to be stuffed with spelling mistakes and largely copied from a textbook. And Jean Tiberi himself, a judge confirmed last week, remains very much under investigation in the so-called HLM, or council-housing, scandal - part of the vast and many tentacled corporate kickback scam by which Chirac's RPR party funded itself back in the 80s and early 90s and which now threatens to engulf the president himself. It would have been more or less impossible for Tiberi - a man of whom Chirac once reportedly said \"would jump through a window if I asked him\" - not to have been aware of what exactly was going on at Paris town hall during the years it was turned into an RPR machine that catapulted Chirac into the presidency of the Republic. Maybe the RPR party should have borne that in mind when it decided that - with the Socialists showing every sign of being in a position to win the capital for the left for the first time since the Paris Commune - it needed a rather more heavyweight candidate for the March 2001 mayoral race. The man it eventually chose was Philippe S\u00e9guin, a former party chairman and portly RPR grandee who is currently running neck and neck in the polls with the Socialist candidate, a hardworking local councillor called Bertrand Delano\u00eb who was one of the first French politicians of any standing to admit he was homosexual. But the RPR has not treated Tiberi very kindly. Indeed, he would contend that it has treated him downright shabbily.

Senior diplomats in Rome expect the 30-minute private meeting to result in an attempt to bolster the Good Friday agreement and reinforce the search for peace in the province. They are also expected to discuss progress towards Christian unity between the Protestant and Catholic churches. Pope John Paul II heads the church to which almost all nationalists and republicans in Ireland at least nominally belong, and the declaration is thought likely to go further than the normal exchange of diplomatic pleasantries between heads of state. A British Vatican diplomat said: \"The Pope has been very supportive and helpful without being too triumphalist. The Vatican has been sensitive to Unionist opinion.\" The Queen arrived in Rome last night for her four-day state visit, accompanied at some distance by up to 3,000 Arsenal supporters - dubbed hooligans by the Italian press - for tonight's Champion's League second round match with the local club Lazio. The royal British Airways chartered flight arrived hours before the soccer fans at Rome's Ciampino Airport, and to a rather warmer welcome. But her dresses, in 10 garment bags labelled \"the Queen\", were dropped by two airport porters, sliding to the ground from a hanging rail. She will attend a banquet at the British ambassador's residence tonight. The royal party was escorted by a mounted cavalry procession to the Quirinale palace where the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh are staying as guests of 79-year-old Italian president, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and his wife Franca. Security surrounding the visit has been stepped up as a result of the Middle East crisis. Speculation about the visit has been intense in the Italian media. But only a few hundred gathered in the twilight outside the palace last night to wave plastic union flags as the Queen's convoy swept through. The Italian press has been speculating for days not only about the royal dress sense - a slightly dowdy, pale peach outfit and brown hat to review the presidential guard at the palace yesterday - and about the Queen's taste in food (no garlic or long strands of spaghetti) but also about who would receive an invitation to last night's presidential banquet at the Quirinale. La Repubblica said yesterday it was a pity that the flamboyant Oscar-winning film actor Roberto Benigni, star of Life is Beautiful, had declined an invitation: \"It is such a shame because if he had grabbed the Queen in a hug he would surely have created a stir and made world headlines.\" Another newspaper, Il Tempo, produced a heavily manipulated photograph showing the Queen apparently in the process of hugging the Duke of Edinburgh and noted that for her visit to Milan later in the week, she will be staying in the same \u00a34,000 a night hotel suite occupied last year by Phil Collins and George Clooney. The Italian government will be footing that bill. Corriere della Sera more soberly noted: \"If anyone finds the Queen cold with few compliments for Bel Paese and its inhabitants, try to be understanding. Her Majesty is working and has not come here on holiday.\" Indeed she is, paying her third visit to Italy as a means of celebrating ties between the two countries, in business where trade is worth \u00a318bn a year and in defence where both countries have cooperated over Kosovo. The Vatican meeting will be the Queen's third encounter with the Pope, but her first since his visit to Britain 18 years ago. The Queen also met Pope John XXIII during a visit in 1961 and as Princess Elizabeth in 1951, Pius XII, now forever tarred for his wartime neutrality.

      "byline": "Hadley Freeman",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The atrium of this London hotel is polished and very, very smooth. It is filled with loud American accents and businessmen in suits. The packs of pinstripes part to reveal, arm in arm, a brown-haired woman with a voluminous skirt and a middle-aged man in brown cords and a tweed jacket. </p> <p>She is Clarissa Dickson Wright - surviving half of the Two Fat Ladies, rector of Aberdeen University, columnist for the Scotland on Sunday, owner of two cafes and one bookshop, former barrister, recovered alcoholic and now television champion for rural Britain. He is Sir John Scott, a hill farmer from Scotland, and her childhood friend. Angered by what she calls \"the un-believable ignorance most people in this country have about the countryside,\" they have filmed a TV series presenting their view of real rural Britain. </p> <p>\"When it comes to the countryside on television,\" says Clarissa, getting into her familiarly strident mode, \"it's all this stultifying sentiment. Those endless Pet Rescue programmes, and things like that. I know a cameraman who worked on one of those programmes and he was describing this bit when a hedgehog was being chased and they rolled the hedgehog down the slope ten times to get the shot. The hedgehog then died and they had to bring in a substitute hedgehog, and this is meant to be 'Oh isn't this sweet.'\" </p> <p>Clarissa and the Countryman is a picaresque tour of the British Isles, with Dickson Wright and Scott celebrating aspects of rural life from wildfowling in Norfolk to coursing in the Lancashire marshes. Clarissa, a self-described townie, who lives in the small Scottish town Musselborough, and Sir John (\"Johnny\" to Clarissa, she is \"Clarrie\" to him) are unequivocal about the intentions and importance of the programme. \"There has been nothing on television about the countryside since the early 70s, when media attention became entirely urban orientated,\" says Johnny. \"The gulf [between the urban and the rural] then grew and the politicians started to use it to their advantage.\" </p> <p>For too long, the British countryside has been presented either as \"full of toffs getting their rocks off\", as Clarissa puts it, or hopelessly backward - a tedious dichotomy between To the Manor Born and Cold Comfort Farm. More importantly, the difficulties facing the rural community today are very real. Scott's lambs, for example, are bought from him for \u00a310 each, fattened up and sold for \u00a314 a kilo in the supermarkets. Whether Dickson Wright and Scott's venture will rectify matters, though, is questionable. </p> <p>In Two Fat Ladies, Clarissa and Jennifer Paterson, who died last year, were as much an anomaly on television themselves as their creamy heavy cooking was at the end of the last decade. Their deep-fried dollop of plain-speaking common sense, harked back to a pre-low fat, pre-stylised, airheaded celebrity age - and who could resist that? More than four million people watched it in the UK, almost 70m worldwide. Understandably, the BBC has stuck to a familiar formula with Clarissa's new series: once again, we see Clarissa plus friend making unusual stops around Britain, presenting a very traditional view of the country. But she is impatient with such comparisons. </p> <p>\"Well, apart from the fact that one was going out and getting wet and wearing different clothes, this is totally different,\" she says, with a particularly stentorian intonation. \"Also, Johnny and I have real friendship.\" </p> <p>\"But weren't you friends with Jen...\" I am not even allowed to finish the question. \"No, that was invented for television. We were like the Spice Girls. It was a very amiable working partnership, but it wasn't friendship.\" </p> <p>Indeed, that pairing always seemed based on a shared body-size and mutual love of cooking. Clarissa always came across as the saner sidekick to Jennifer's verbal wanderings, full of rolling r's and sudden increases in volume (\"Pour HALF a pint of CREAM in ...\") </p> <p>Johnny and Clarissa have a very real friendship. They finish one another's anecdotes and look into each other's eyes. \"The thing about Clarrie,\" he says, looking at her across the table, \"is that she has the unique ability to squeeze every drop of pleasure out of the day, and ensures that everyone around her enjoys it as much as she does.\" She looks down at the tablecloth, smiling. Later, when the photographer asks them to pose near a large plant in the lobby, they swat each other with the leaves and make shadow animals on the wall. </p> <p>The forthrightness of Dickson Wright can be a joy. When asked which programme she enjoyed making more, her unhesitating answer is, \"This one,\" a reply devoid of any bland PR tact. She recently took Jamie Oliver to task for advertising Sainsbury's without shopping at the supermarket himself. \"We all know now he did it just for a handful of silver, don't we?\" she grins. Johnny is equally forthright. For example, what does he think of vegetarians? He smiles slyly. \"Very sad.\" They both laugh delightedly. The American businessman at the table next to us picks nervously at his melon. </p> <p>But such frankness can work against them. Few people are so vehemently pro low-fat cooking that they would be offended by Clarissa's cooking, but many have stronger views on the subject of hunting and bloodsports. She claims to be unconcerned. \"Well, if the BBC get cold feet over this, Discovery, ABC or somebody else would probably recommission it.\" </p> <p>Clarissa's pro-hunting views are well known, and have already been criticised. In their book, which accompanies the series, Johnny describes a protestor shouting at Clarissa: \"One fat lady's dead. One to go.\" So are they prepared for more inevitable criticism when the series is aired? \"I think what we're doing is too important for personal worries to intervene,\" she says with a breezy wave. \"But, yes, I am fully prepared.\" </p> <p>Clarissa and Johnny repeatedly insist that all they want is \"tolerance\", but any questioning or criticism of their views is dismissed as \"townie ignorance\". She describes how one original member of the television crew was sacked \"because she had a fixed set of ideas. They weren't exactly anti ideas but they weren't how it was, and she kept putting everybody's backs up.\" </p> <p>In reference to the government's anti-hunting leanings, they are particularly vehement.

      "bodyText": "The atrium of this London hotel is polished and very, very smooth. It is filled with loud American accents and businessmen in suits. The packs of pinstripes part to reveal, arm in arm, a brown-haired woman with a voluminous skirt and a middle-aged man in brown cords and a tweed jacket. She is Clarissa Dickson Wright - surviving half of the Two Fat Ladies, rector of Aberdeen University, columnist for the Scotland on Sunday, owner of two cafes and one bookshop, former barrister, recovered alcoholic and now television champion for rural Britain. He is Sir John Scott, a hill farmer from Scotland, and her childhood friend. Angered by what she calls \"the un-believable ignorance most people in this country have about the countryside,\" they have filmed a TV series presenting their view of real rural Britain. \"When it comes to the countryside on television,\" says Clarissa, getting into her familiarly strident mode, \"it's all this stultifying sentiment. Those endless Pet Rescue programmes, and things like that. I know a cameraman who worked on one of those programmes and he was describing this bit when a hedgehog was being chased and they rolled the hedgehog down the slope ten times to get the shot. The hedgehog then died and they had to bring in a substitute hedgehog, and this is meant to be 'Oh isn't this sweet.'\" Clarissa and the Countryman is a picaresque tour of the British Isles, with Dickson Wright and Scott celebrating aspects of rural life from wildfowling in Norfolk to coursing in the Lancashire marshes. Clarissa, a self-described townie, who lives in the small Scottish town Musselborough, and Sir John (\"Johnny\" to Clarissa, she is \"Clarrie\" to him) are unequivocal about the intentions and importance of the programme. \"There has been nothing on television about the countryside since the early 70s, when media attention became entirely urban orientated,\" says Johnny. \"The gulf [between the urban and the rural] then grew and the politicians started to use it to their advantage.\" For too long, the British countryside has been presented either as \"full of toffs getting their rocks off\", as Clarissa puts it, or hopelessly backward - a tedious dichotomy between To the Manor Born and Cold Comfort Farm. More importantly, the difficulties facing the rural community today are very real. Scott's lambs, for example, are bought from him for \u00a310 each, fattened up and sold for \u00a314 a kilo in the supermarkets. Whether Dickson Wright and Scott's venture will rectify matters, though, is questionable. In Two Fat Ladies, Clarissa and Jennifer Paterson, who died last year, were as much an anomaly on television themselves as their creamy heavy cooking was at the end of the last decade. Their deep-fried dollop of plain-speaking common sense, harked back to a pre-low fat, pre-stylised, airheaded celebrity age - and who could resist that? More than four million people watched it in the UK, almost 70m worldwide. Understandably, the BBC has stuck to a familiar formula with Clarissa's new series: once again, we see Clarissa plus friend making unusual stops around Britain, presenting a very traditional view of the country. But she is impatient with such comparisons. \"Well, apart from the fact that one was going out and getting wet and wearing different clothes, this is totally different,\" she says, with a particularly stentorian intonation. \"Also, Johnny and I have real friendship.\" \"But weren't you friends with Jen...\" I am not even allowed to finish the question. \"No, that was invented for television. We were like the Spice Girls. It was a very amiable working partnership, but it wasn't friendship.\" Indeed, that pairing always seemed based on a shared body-size and mutual love of cooking. Clarissa always came across as the saner sidekick to Jennifer's verbal wanderings, full of rolling r's and sudden increases in volume (\"Pour HALF a pint of CREAM in ...\") Johnny and Clarissa have a very real friendship. They finish one another's anecdotes and look into each other's eyes. \"The thing about Clarrie,\" he says, looking at her across the table, \"is that she has the unique ability to squeeze every drop of pleasure out of the day, and ensures that everyone around her enjoys it as much as she does.\" She looks down at the tablecloth, smiling. Later, when the photographer asks them to pose near a large plant in the lobby, they swat each other with the leaves and make shadow animals on the wall. The forthrightness of Dickson Wright can be a joy. When asked which programme she enjoyed making more, her unhesitating answer is, \"This one,\" a reply devoid of any bland PR tact. She recently took Jamie Oliver to task for advertising Sainsbury's without shopping at the supermarket himself. \"We all know now he did it just for a handful of silver, don't we?\" she grins. Johnny is equally forthright. For example, what does he think of vegetarians? He smiles slyly. \"Very sad.\" They both laugh delightedly. The American businessman at the table next to us picks nervously at his melon. But such frankness can work against them. Few people are so vehemently pro low-fat cooking that they would be offended by Clarissa's cooking, but many have stronger views on the subject of hunting and bloodsports. She claims to be unconcerned. \"Well, if the BBC get cold feet over this, Discovery, ABC or somebody else would probably recommission it.\" Clarissa's pro-hunting views are well known, and have already been criticised. In their book, which accompanies the series, Johnny describes a protestor shouting at Clarissa: \"One fat lady's dead. One to go.\" So are they prepared for more inevitable criticism when the series is aired? \"I think what we're doing is too important for personal worries to intervene,\" she says with a breezy wave. \"But, yes, I am fully prepared.\" Clarissa and Johnny repeatedly insist that all they want is \"tolerance\", but any questioning or criticism of their views is dismissed as \"townie ignorance\". She describes how one original member of the television crew was sacked \"because she had a fixed set of ideas. They weren't exactly anti ideas but they weren't how it was, and she kept putting everybody's backs up.\" In reference to the government's anti-hunting leanings, they are particularly vehement. One of her favourite references, disconcertingly, is to Adolf Hitler: \"Hitler was the last man to ban fox hunting, it was the first thing he did when he came to power,\" Clarissa says, with an emphatic tap on the table. \"It was about regulating something he didn't understand. OK, his second act was a little more serious, but this government is messing with things they don't understand and don't want to because they are paid not to.\" (Clarissa and Sir John argue that the \u00a31.1m donation from the International Fund for Animal Liberation to the Labour government is \"payment for legislation\".) At the end of the interview the recorder is turned off and both relax. Picking up on my accent, they talk briefly about Americans:\"We met a lot of Americans in our travels who described hunting as their idea of Heaven. Wonderful people.\" After a warm peck from Clarissa and a gentlemanly handshake from Johnny, Clarissa lowers her chin and raises her eyebrows imperiously at me. \"Be fair,\" she calls out, in a matronly tone of voice. \"That's all we ask, you know.\"",

      "body": "<p>In his prime during the 1970s, Peter Bogdanovich felt that The Godfather and Chinatown were directing assignments he could refuse, Cybill Shepherd was the lover for whom he should abandon his wife and newborn child, and only time seemed to separate him from legendary status in Hollywood. But then he fell. \"I felt that by the mid-70s I'd blown it,\" says Bogdanovich, now 61, sitting in a deserted Thai restaurant on Manhattan's Upper West Side. \"William Friedkin had blown it, Robert Altman went into eclipse, one flop after another, Coppola went crazy, even Raging Bull didn't do any business. Everybody kind of blew it in varying shapes and sizes.\" </p> <p>Since those glory days, the acclaimed director of The Last Picture Show and Paper Moon has become an outcast in the movie community, reduced to making low-brow TV movies. He has endured bankruptcy twice, the brutal murder of his lover and, after marrying her young sister, the disdain of America's perennially-affronted tabloids. </p> <p>Now, despite his tale of misery and woe, Bogdanovich is in the process of staging an ambitious, if tentative, comeback. With a recurring role in The Sopranos, the celebrated TV series about the New Jersey mafia, he has reclaimed at least part of the lustre that once made him a high-profile figure. Playing an analyst to the psychiatrist treating the drama's mafia don, he has a small but pivotal comedic role in the nonchalantly violent show that has become one of the most popular in America. Bogdanovich is pleased, if typically calm when discussing his part in the series that excitable critics have described as the most significant addition to American culture in 25 years. Not least because he is able to act again: \"After the second day of shooting, David Chase [Sopranos creator] called me and asked me if I'd acted before. No one seemed to have been aware that I had been trained as a kid by Stella Adler. I have been acting since I was 15 years old and I enjoy it now as much as I ever did.\" </p> <p>Bogdanovich removes his trademark tinted glasses, concentrating on the opinions he will share. His deliberation might be practiced, adopted after an early career faux pas when he compared his talent - rather than his sharp professional decline - to that of Orson Welles. \"I don't judge myself on the basis of my contemporaries,\" he told the New York Times. \"I judge myself against those I admire - Hawks, Hitchcock and Welles. I don't think I'm anywhere as good as they are, but I think I'm pretty good.\" </p> <p>Welles remains an enormous figure to Bogdanovich. Down on his luck in the 70s, the corpulent legend lodged with Bogdanovich for two years in a spare room at the young director's enormous Beverly Hills mansion. The two spent many hours discussing films, the movie business and how to stay at the top. Normally stoic, Bogdanovich laughs fondly when discussing his mentor, recalling how Welles's mistress would appal him with her guttural language and dirty jokes. </p> <p>After the bubble burst on his career, few of Bogdanovich's enemies in the industry mourned his demise, the same reaction many had had to Welles's decline. Ironically, directors like Welles and John Ford were friends from his early days as a film critic in New York and as a writer at Esquire magazine alongside a young Tom Wolfe. With his two Oscar nominations for The Last Picture Show and the success of Paper Moon and What's Up, Doc? those old acquaintances congratulated Bogdanovich as he and peers such as De Palma, Spielberg, Lucas and Coppola redefined Hollywood for their generation. </p> <p>But as the young directors flourished and their hedonistic appetites increased accordingly throughout the 70s, falls from grace were inevitable. Bogdanovich's particular nemesis arrived on August 14 1980. Actress and former Playboy centrefold Dorothy Stratten had her head blown off by her estranged husband Paul Snider. He then had sex with her corpse before shooting himself in the head. Stratten had been the love of Bogdanovich's life. They had become a couple less than a year earlier, after meeting in Hugh Hefner's Los Angeles mansion. He made her the star of his film, They All Laughed, and appeared to be moulding her as his protege in the same way he had with a young Cybill Shepherd. </p> <p>But her death left him a devastated wreck. Faced with the further revelation that 20th Century Fox were not keen to push hard on the film's marketing, the impassioned, still grief-stricken Bogdanovich bought the film negative from the studio and set about doing the job himself. The catastrophic box office performance of They All Laughed cost Bogdanovich $5m and ultimately sent him on his first trip to the bankruptcy court. \"It was career suicide,\" he said. </p> <p>Seeking comfort in the others who loved Stratten, he then began paying for her mother Nelly and sister Louise to make regular trips from Canada to his 19-room home in California. The nature of Bogdanovich's relationship with the teenage Louise, who was 12 when her sister died, has remained a subject of much debate and legendary gossip. Bogdanovich married her eight years later in Vancouver. They are still together and living in a small apartment just a few streets away from the childhood home he shared with his mother and painter father on Manhattan's Upper West Side. </p> <p>\"I married Dorothy's younger sister and I think there was a great deal of controversy because everybody has to talk about something. But I think what I did is not so unusual because it all boils down to the old cliche, which is to ask your lover, 'Are there any more at home who are just like you ?' As it happened there was. The whole thing was a mess and it wasn't good for anybody, but especially for Louise because she was so young. It was very ugly, especially after I criticised Hugh Hefner for his magazine's role in Dorothy's death and he came back at me about Louise. </p> <p>\"Dorothy's murder sent me reeling for a long time,\" he says. \"That event triggered a lot of reactions in me and I had to question everything in my life. I certainly didn't think I'd ever direct another picture. In fact, I eventually had to because I went bankrupt. The death is with Louise and I all the time. But that is okay. We deal with it. Now I'm steadier and taking every day as it comes.\" </p> <p>Beneath the humble exterior lurks an auteur's ego. He is still driven with the same passion as before, and plans to direct several new projects. New Hollywood has given him its stamp of approval. Just as the young pretender Bogdanovich came to the rescue of Welles when Hollywood abandoned him, he himself has been championed by Quentin Tarantino: the Pulp Fiction director offered to let Bogdanovich stay at his Los Angeles home when his financial problems overcame him, and has agreed to act in a new comedy about a film director haunted by ghosts of his past, written and directed by Bogdanovich. \"Quentin is a friend and we were ready to start shooting last year,\" says Bogdanovich. \"We had $15m in financing and were ready, but I felt the script wasn't quite right. So I've put it on hold until I've rewritten it sufficiently.\" </p> <p>The ghost project, along with The Cat's Meow (a comedy about Charlie Chaplin and William Randolph Hearst in the 1920s) and a script based on three stories by Robert Graves have buoyed Bogdanovich's confidence enough to give him real expectations for the future. \"I won't ever get back into the Hollywood loop,\" he concludes. \"But I want to be back in the position of making personal, yet not private films. I don't want to be a gun for hire. I'm just not comfortable with that.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Sopranos, Channel 4, Thursdays, 10.30pm.</p>",

The Extreme Sports Channel, due to launch on the Astra satellite network later this month, said it had been unable to get onto the Telewest network, despite the fact that UPC, which owns 50% of the channel, is also to take a 25% stake in Telewest. Home shopping channel QVC is developing an interactive rival to BSkyB's Open...based on its QVC directory service. ONdigital has failed to identify the reasons for the disappearance from the air of its ONrequest service for three days last week. Canal Plus Technologies, which supplies the operating system, says it believes the outage was caused by a hardware problem. NMM quotes several senior advertising executives who say the ITC's relaxation of sponsorship rules announced last week do not go far enough. The head of digital at J.

The move, to a purpose-built, state-of-the-art news centre in which all the BBC's journalists across radio, television, satellite and online would be congregated, was a pet project of the then director-general, John Birt, and his head of news and current affairs, Tony Hall.

I said it was inimical to pluralism and the integrity of each radio station's distinctive sound, that White City was a mad place to site the Today programme, and that the figures were unbelievable. It was also obvious - even before a brick was laid - that the site was far too small. </p> <p>The worst damage, I feared, would be to Radio 4. Broadcasting House, in the heart of central London, was easy for interviewees to reach. Who would be willing to toil down to Shepherd's Bush at 7am to face Jim Naughtie? The dread sound of the \"down the line\" interview would become the norm, to the detriment of one of the BBC's most important programmes. And while it was clearly sensible to centralise the collecting of the raw material for news, it was impossible to meet the needs and agendas of all the BBC's different audiences - from Radio 1 to the Nine O'Clock News - with the same amorphous and interchangeable troupe of journalists producing the finished programmes. </p> <p>John Birt had, with great courage, brought radical reforms to the BBC. Everything was subjected to minute scrutiny of costs, management and strategic aim. The exception to such long overdue rigour was this costly and controversial proposal to yank all radio journalism out of its home and into a forced marriage with television. </p> <p>The ostensible gains were huge financial efficiencies. But no one apart from John Birt and Tony Hall was ever allowed to see the detailed figures. I never met anyone else who believed them for a minute. Stage Six, as the new journalism factory was called, was more than a new office. It was a physical symbol of corporate purpose. Practical arguments about the needs of programmes and programme-makers were secondary. </p> <p>The governors were in an impossible position. Several declared private support for radio's case but, faced with the insistence of their director-general, the whole thing had become an issue of confidence. It was a choice between losing a managing director and losing a director-general. Quite understandably, they chose the former. </p> <p>Having lost the argument I had no alternative but to resign, but I was determined not to become a stick for enemies of the corporation to beat it with. For the past five years I have refused to discuss my resignation or to utter a critical syllable about the BBC, which I value and admire passionately. </p> <p>But what I thought was water under the bridge has suddenly turned into a whirlpool. The BBC is now reported to have discovered serious doubts after all about the suitability of White City for a journalistic centre and is said to be considering reversing the whole damaging episode.

No doubt the BBC will be angered by my writing this after all this time. The criterion in both cases is the same: whether any purpose would be served by speaking out.

Paul Curtis, C5i's chief executive, said: \"By avoiding the traditional internet sales house idea we feel we have established something more focused and dynamic - the first UK internet sales agency. \"We want to establish a network of clients whose interests are represented to the advertising community by dedicated account handlers. Not only that, we want to establish a set of advertising propositions that advertisers can cherry-pick to meet specific marketing objectives.\" Nick Bampton, sales director of C5i, added: \"Our business is maximising revenue for our publishers and advertisers. It is our belief that we can best do this by providing advertising solutions, which are relevant and focused - always with the advertiser in mind. Our core values of integrity, transparency, open-mindedness, and belief in partnership ensure that this vision is consistent throughout the entire team.\" Unlike others in the online advertising sales market, C5i will offer bespoke advertising solutions - to publisher and advertiser alike - rather than blanket selling of internet impressions. The agency plans to represent a small number of large publishers, sold to key advertisers, fulfilling detailed advertising briefs.",

And higher prices look here to stay. The centrepiece of the Merrill Lynch presentation was a thesis that there had been a paradigm shift in the fundamentals of the oil price: the Brent blend average price of $18 over the last decade will be left behind, they say, towards an average close to $23.50 meaning higher profitability for everyone. </p> <p>But as oil companies become ever larger through merger and acquisition, there have been growing signs of concern amongst the regulators. BP Amoco ran into ferocious opposition with the federal trade commission in the early stages of its Arco takeover and was forced to hive off assets in an effort to appease the civil servants. Chevron and Texaco may have to dispose of several refineries and hundreds of petrol stations to get their deal accepted. </p> <p>Then there is the fee-making instincts of the investment banking community, which has already made money by building up these new industrial goliaths. At least one London bank was willing to predict privately last night that it would soon be time to start breaking up the super majors to take advantage of small but potentially lucrative opportunities for their now sprawling empires.</p>",

The centrepiece of the Merrill Lynch presentation was a thesis that there had been a paradigm shift in the fundamentals of the oil price: the Brent blend average price of $18 over the last decade will be left behind, they say, towards an average close to $23.50 meaning higher profitability for everyone. But as oil companies become ever larger through merger and acquisition, there have been growing signs of concern amongst the regulators. BP Amoco ran into ferocious opposition with the federal trade commission in the early stages of its Arco takeover and was forced to hive off assets in an effort to appease the civil servants. Chevron and Texaco may have to dispose of several refineries and hundreds of petrol stations to get their deal accepted. Then there is the fee-making instincts of the investment banking community, which has already made money by building up these new industrial goliaths. At least one London bank was willing to predict privately last night that it would soon be time to start breaking up the super majors to take advantage of small but potentially lucrative opportunities for their now sprawling empires.",

The western nations, particularly America, were consuming cheap oil as if there were no tomorrow, becoming still more dependent on foreign producers, led by Saudi Arabia. When the Arab-Israel war broke out in 1973 the Arab producers boycotted oil to western countries - which in turn precipitated the shortage and huge price hikes.</p> <p>The crisis took the media and the governments almost totally by surprise The American government had been warned over the previous years that the Saudis would find it hard to resist a boycott, but President Nixon in the run-up to a presidential election could not risk offending Israel. Most oil companies remained complacent until the shock happened: then it created a sudden panic, generating desperate demand, queues for petrol and hectic bidding for oil which forced the price still higher.</p> <p>Does that sound familiar? Of course much has changed in 27 years. Today the Arab oil-producers are less dominating and less greedy, as they realise the danger to themselves of extorting too high a price. There is no danger of a military war against Israel comparable to the threat of Egypt and Syria when they invaded in 1973. Most of the world's oil comes from countries outside Opec, including Britain; and most countries have contingency plans against a shortage. \"The west is now much better able to withstand an oil shock,\" the Financial Times assures us.</p> <p>Yet the similarities remain. The Americans have been consuming oil as recklessly as they were in 1973: their roads are full of new gas-guzzlers, the huge \"utility vehicles\" like mini-tanks which loom above the road, intimidating the smaller cars, and consuming a gallon every 10 miles. Stretch limos, golf buggies and speedboats compete in guzzling oil with no thought of the conservation movements of the 80s.</p> <p>The American government and media have largely lost interest in understanding Arab and other third world oil-producers, which loomed so large in the 70s and early 80s. And during the presidential elections neither candidate dares either to sympathise with Arab grievances, or suggest that Americans should conserve oil, or pay more for it.</p> <p>The Europeans have been less wasteful, but still complacent. The rapid increase of the world oil price in the past two years, which should have been seen as a warning of a coming shortage, has led only to a clamour to reduce taxes and bring the price down. The British have now still fewer alternatives to the private car, with a failing railway network and decaying public transport for commuters.</p> <p>It is only high oil prices and the fear of potential shortage which compels countries to conserve fuel and press forward with other forms of energy and transport. But the British, like the Americans, are becoming still more dependent on cars and oil.</p> <p>In the meantime Asian and Latin American consumers are joining in the demand for unlimited cheap oil, without the prospect of unlimited supplies. While huge new reserves are opening up in central Asia and Africa, they all have their own political risks, in dangerous and remote parts of the world. The most accessible new oil remains in Arab countries which have their own quarrels with the west, including Iraq which now has huge new potential oil supplies.</p> <p>The key oil producer, which holds the balance, remains the most problematic of all: Saudi Arabia. While the Saudi monarchy is ostensibly pro-American, dependent on American military and security support, they are becoming more worried by their own fundamentalists and dissidents who bitterly resent their government's subservience to the Americans, all the more since they rescued them from Saddam in the Gulf war 10 years ago.</p> <p>The hijacking of a Saudi plane on Saturday by Saudi dissidents was a reminder of the vulnerability of the kingdom, where the greed and corruption of the royal family and the ignoring of human rights have caused a groundswell of resentment from fundamentalists, Shi'ites and exploited foreign workers. The demonstrations inside Saudi Arabia in support of Palestinians have been a reminder of the dangers of a pro-western policy. The lack of reliable reports in the media from inside the kingdom - there are no foreign correspondents there - is hardly reassuring: in Saudi Arabia, no news usually means bad news.</p> <p>It is true that America and Israel have an overwhelming military might in the Middle East.

As much as the then president's so-called grands projets - the Op\u00e9ra Bastille, La D\u00e9fense, the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale and IM Pei's pyramid at the Louvre - Minitel showed that France was a thoroughly modern place. It must have been particularly pleasing for French patriots to look across the Channel and witness the failure of Prestel, Britain's long-defunct version of Minitel. You remember Prestel, don't you? Thought not. </p> <p>From these beginnings, Minitel went from strength to strength. It quickly became linked to other central databanks. It was a newspaper, a mail-order service, a ticket agency, a railway and airline bookings office, an online bill-paying service, an encyclopaedia - all at once. </p> <p>Minitel hardware evolved over the years, including a desktop computer version and even a laptop, but all had French keyboards, which to qwerty-fixated Anglo-Saxons was rather irritating. What's more, it is still operated in the same way as it was back in 1982. The Minitel terminal in the Guardian's Paris office, for instance, has a black monitor and phone receiver, and a keyboard best operated by the fingers of a small child. </p> <p>By the start of the 1990s, there were 6.5m Minitel terminals in France, 80% of them in private households. This year, there were an estimated 17m Minitel users in France - some 20% of the population. It seems an incredible success story, particularly when you consider that France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, which, in the 80s, was a public corporation, was acting on behalf of a dirigiste government that saw Minitel as a means of promoting a particular vision of French social and political interaction. </p> <p>And it worked: no other country in the world embraced Minitel. It seemed a perfect example of l'exception fran\u00e7aise. Yes, it's true that you can access Minitel from the internet, but the point remains: Minitel showed France thriving outside the globalising tendencies of Anglo-Saxon culture. </p> <p>Or did it? There is a parallel technological story to that of France's Minitel - that of the rise of the internet, which is, at least in part, the story of the rise and rise of the English language. Even now, only 2% of internet data is in French. Minitel, perhaps, could have been a contender to fight back against the internet domination but it was too nationally defined to do so. </p> <p>France has been slow to move into the world of the internet, and part of the reason for that is the success of Minitel and the huge investment of national pride in this defiantly Frenchy invention. Arguably, for a long time after Minitel should have been ditched, the French stayed with relatively expensive, limited and non-international communications technology. And, while the French had been the envy of their neighbours during the 80s because of Minitel, in the following decade they were derided for not keeping up with the communications revolution. </p> <p>At the start of 1999, the number of French net users was half that of Britain's. President Jacques Chirac didn't get his own email address until 1998 and even then he specified that replies to emails would be sent by ordinary post. That said, the French are now adapting to the internet with gusto. In May this year, a survey by the IT consultancy CMG of 250 companies in Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands, showed that France had succeeded in knocking the UK into second place in the European e-commerce stakes. Suddenly, every poster in the metro is advertising a web company selling food, wine, books, clothes, bank accounts, holidays or stocks and shares. In this climate, Minitel seems doomed. </p> <p>But that ain't necessarily so. Just as anti-globalisation campaigner Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 tapped into a rich French vein of resentment for many things Anglo-Saxon and for lousy American food in particular when he vandalised a McDonald's restaurant last year, so Minitel need not politely defer to the internet. Just yet. Dominique Lamiche of France T\u00e9l\u00e9com says: \"We'll always have people who prefer to buy a train ticket on the Minitel because it's fast and one knows how to manage it. You don't need the internet's animated pictures to buy a simple train ticket.\" </p> <p>And, indeed, that is one of the things that makes Minitel worth preserving. It is quicker at some things than the internet - booking train or airline tickets especially. But secure payment is Minitel's main advantage. All terminals have a chip to enable electronic payment, and France T\u00e9l\u00e9com guarantees the safety of the network. As a result, French people are used to buying goods on the Minitel. In 1998, e-commerce was worth 6bn francs (about \u00a3600m), but only 15m francs (about \u00a31.5m) on the internet. </p> <p>Sceptics suggest the Minitel's relaunch is little more than a stay of execution.

Mr Arafat also wants Israel to lift a closure on the West Bank and Gaza, which has cut off his people from jobs in Israel that are a lifeline.</p> <p>Those demands are unthinkable for Mr Barak, who is facing intense domestic pressure to take a tough stand against the Palestinians. \"Mr Barak is fed up with Arafat,\" said Nachman Shai, an Israeli spokesman.</p> <p>The two sides remain no closer on reconciling Palestinian demands for a full-scale international investigation into the violence.</p> <p>That demand wrecked a summit earlier this month between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in Paris.</p> <p>Yesterday, Mr Barak was willing to concede only a modest fact-finding committee under US auspices.</p> <p>In Beirut, the secretary general of the Lebanese Hizbullah group, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, said that an Israeli in their hands was a Mossad officer seeking to penetrate their ranks. He said Elhahan Tenenbaum had been lured to Lebanon and seized there, not in Switzerland, as previously reported. He had travelled to Beirut from Brussels on a false foreign passport.</p> <p>But Israel continued to insist the man was a private individual who had no connection with the Mossad.

Despite more than 11 hours of coddling by the leaders and diplomats, Israel and the Palestinians drew no nearer to an agreement to end the carnage. Instead, Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, remained locked in recrimination, revisiting the atmosphere of hatred and suspicion that ruled the region before the two sides embraced the path of peace seven years ago. The two leaders did not hold one-on-one meetings, channelling their frustrations through Mr Clinton, who met each man twice, and the summit host, the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak. \"I saw Mr Barak on television and he was full of venom, intransigence, and cruelty,\" said Nabil Shaath, a senior Palestinian negotiator. \"He still talks like an occupier.\" Arab governments were said to be threatening to link progress on the Israel-Palestine dispute to a threat to lift sanctions against Iraq, seriously eroded in recent weeks. This would pose a serious problem for the US and force it to choose between two issues of vital importance. Yesterday's standoff defied efforts by Mr Clinton, the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, the European Union's Javier Solana and the leaders of Jordan and Egypt. All spoke of their fears of a deepening confrontation. \"We should not give it all up for what has happened in the last few weeks, and what has happened in the last few weeks reminds us of the terrible alternatives to continuing to live in peace, and to continuing the peace process,\" Mr Clinton said. The kernel of yesterday's dispute lies in Mr Barak's insistence that Mr Arafat halt the violence by reining in Palestinian policemen and the tanzim, the armed cells of his Fatah organisation, which have opened fire on Israeli soldiers. The Palestinians are adamant that Israel yield first by rolling back its tanks positioned outside luxury flats in Ramallah and in other West Bank cities. Mr Arafat also wants Israel to lift a closure on the West Bank and Gaza, which has cut off his people from jobs in Israel that are a lifeline. Those demands are unthinkable for Mr Barak, who is facing intense domestic pressure to take a tough stand against the Palestinians. \"Mr Barak is fed up with Arafat,\" said Nachman Shai, an Israeli spokesman. The two sides remain no closer on reconciling Palestinian demands for a full-scale international investigation into the violence. That demand wrecked a summit earlier this month between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in Paris. Yesterday, Mr Barak was willing to concede only a modest fact-finding committee under US auspices. In Beirut, the secretary general of the Lebanese Hizbullah group, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, said that an Israeli in their hands was a Mossad officer seeking to penetrate their ranks. He said Elhahan Tenenbaum had been lured to Lebanon and seized there, not in Switzerland, as previously reported. He had travelled to Beirut from Brussels on a false foreign passport. But Israel continued to insist the man was a private individual who had no connection with the Mossad. The Israeli media has been told there are legal restrictions on reporting the case.

A few couples enjoy a quiet half in the pub, at the top of the village street an elderly man weeds through his flower bed, but most of the low, leaded windows on the half-timbered chocolate-box houses are dark.</p> <p>Inside you can see televisions, videos and microwaves; no doubt there is a fair amount of jewellery tucked away in this affluent commuter village, 25 miles south of Manchester. But almost none of the cottages has a lock on its windows, and only a couple have burglar alarms. This is not a community, it seems, that lives in fear of crime.</p> <p>\"I think people feel more secure in the country,\" says Jane Perry, 32, who lives in the nearby village of Marston but has come to Budworth for a quiet drink. \"There's less opportunity to steal things.\" Her husband Danny, a builder, agrees that burglary is not much of a worry. \"We have dogs, and we do lock everything, obviously, but in 10 years we have never had a problem in our house.\"</p> <p>The villagers of Great Budworth neatly illustrate the paradox in the way rural crime is perceived. They say they are surprised to learn that burglaries are falling in rural areas, that they would have thought crime was on the up. But then, come to think of it, they can't remember having any trouble themselves.</p> <p>Sue Scott's husband's family has lived in the village for decades. \"I'm not too concerned,\" she says. \"I feel that I'm rather protected here.\" She has never felt the need for an alarm on her home - her neighbours, after all, are watching the house if she is out. \"We keep an eye on each others' homes.

      "bodyText": "At least until 3pm, when the narrow lanes suddenly throng with bullish 4x4 vehicles on the school run, the streets of Great Budworth in Cheshire are almost silent. A few couples enjoy a quiet half in the pub, at the top of the village street an elderly man weeds through his flower bed, but most of the low, leaded windows on the half-timbered chocolate-box houses are dark. Inside you can see televisions, videos and microwaves; no doubt there is a fair amount of jewellery tucked away in this affluent commuter village, 25 miles south of Manchester. But almost none of the cottages has a lock on its windows, and only a couple have burglar alarms. This is not a community, it seems, that lives in fear of crime. \"I think people feel more secure in the country,\" says Jane Perry, 32, who lives in the nearby village of Marston but has come to Budworth for a quiet drink. \"There's less opportunity to steal things.\" Her husband Danny, a builder, agrees that burglary is not much of a worry. \"We have dogs, and we do lock everything, obviously, but in 10 years we have never had a problem in our house.\" The villagers of Great Budworth neatly illustrate the paradox in the way rural crime is perceived. They say they are surprised to learn that burglaries are falling in rural areas, that they would have thought crime was on the up. But then, come to think of it, they can't remember having any trouble themselves. Sue Scott's husband's family has lived in the village for decades. \"I'm not too concerned,\" she says. \"I feel that I'm rather protected here.\" She has never felt the need for an alarm on her home - her neighbours, after all, are watching the house if she is out. \"We keep an eye on each others' homes. Everyone is close to their neighbours.\" But despite Great Budworth's picture-postcard appearance, all is not entirely idyllic. Break-ins may not concern the residents unduly but car crime, they agree, is more of a problem. Mrs Scott's car and that of her next-door neighbour were broken into last year. One man, sipping Guinness in the pub, admits that he came to the village partly to see if a man he suspects of breaking into his van is around.

There is no treatment for Ebola, whose victims rapidly bleed to death. Because it is highly infectious, the only hope of stopping an outbreak is isolating victims and their contacts. Until the weekend, the victims had been restricted to a 20-mile radius of the northern Ugandan district capital of Gulu, which is 225 miles north of the capital, Kampala. However, since Saturday new cases have been reported outside the original area of infection. \"Four cases have been reported in neighbouring Kitgum district, while five people have been admitted to hospital from Pece, a suburb of Gulu town which was not affected before,\" said Lt Col Walter Ochoro, who heads a taskforce set up to combat the disease. More worryingly still, two cases of Ebola have also been reported in Atiak and Amoru, two congested camps north and west of Gulu that are home to tens of thousands of people displaced by the insurgency in the region. Oladapo Walker, Uganda's WHO representative, said: \"This is a problem but we just have to do the best that we can under the circumstances. \"If we are able to quickly isolate the reported cases in the camps we should be able to contain it very quickly.

International aid workers and scientists are converging on the area to support the Ugandan effort and study the disease. The WHO has sent two Ebola experts to Gulu and two more, one epidomologist and one specialist in barrier nursing, are due to fly in today. A public education programme has been launched, advising local people to stay away from infected people and to suspend cultural practices, such as burial rights, that might inadvertently spread the disease.

His adaptation of James Jones's novel is set during the savage battle for Guadalcanal in the Pacific during the second world war - a semi-mystical meditation on men in battle that builds a collage of (often voiced-over) thoughts and feelings amid scenes of terrifying brutality, committed on an island of stunning beauty.",

The two decades that have passed since Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai peninsula have brought a wholesale transformation to what was once a simple Bedouin village.</p> <p>Known for its pristine sands and crystal clear coves teeming with fluorescent tropical fish, the Sharm of today is the region's equivalent of the Costa del Sol. It is especially popular with Italian package tourists, who arrive on direct charters from Rome and Milan.</p> <p>At the Hyatt hotel the delegation bedded down in 300 rooms, including 18 for CNN and other television crews. Italian tourists were bundled out of their rooms, with their bags half-packed. The press secretary of the US embassy in Tel Aviv was also evicted at 2am yesterday morning.</p> <p>Security was tight. In the US entourage, a Clinton double rode in the black limousine. The real US president exited from a lowly jeep.</p> <p>At 4pm there was a flurry of excitement when President Clinton, accompanied by about 20 people, took a five-minute stroll around the golf course. At 100-yard intervals between the stubby palm trees were shorter stumps: motionless security men in suits.</p> <p>The Israelis arrived with their own baggage, principally the posse of spin doctors on the prime ministerial aircraft, who distributed lurid pictures from nearly three weeks of bloodshed and factsheets on the dangerous Hamas bombers freed from Palestinian jails last week. They also handed out videos of incendiary sermons from the imam of a Gaza mosque.</p> <p>An honour guard clad in white lined the route from the airport - their backs to the road and their eyes resolutely fixed on the desert horizon.</p> <p>But as the prime minister, Ehud Barak, drove to the summit centre - the Jolie Ville hotel - US and Palestinian flags were visible but not the Israeli star of David. During the last few days of tension, the Egyptian official press has returned to the language of the 1970s, before there was a peace agreement with Israel, referring to their neighbour as the \"Zionist entity\".</p> <p>During a three-way meeting with Mr Barak and the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, King Abdullah of Jordan said that more than a fortnight of killing in Israeli-occupied territories had badly shaken the forces of peace.</p> <p>\"We must build the peace camp anew among all the states including mine,\" the Jordanian ruler said, according to Israeli officials.</p> <p>The isolation of the place makes it easy to forget the bombs, bullets and stones that were the official reason for calling this summit - though many Arab journalists believe the real motive was to upstage the Arab summit, due to be held in Cairo this weekend.</p> <p>Many believe that Mr Mubarak has ambitions to turn Sharm into the Middle East's own Camp David.</p> <p>Four years ago it hosted a summit attended by 29 world leaders, again in response to a wave of violence - a series of anti-Israeli suicide bombings which killed 62 people.</p> <p>In September last year, Israelis and Palestinians signed a West Bank land-for-security agreement and earlier this month the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, met Mr Arafat in Sharm. Mr Barak had refused her invitation.</p> <p><b>The demands</b><br></p> <p><b> Israelis</b><br></p> <p><b> Short term</b></p> <p>\u0095 Arafat to order immediate halt to violence</p> <p>\u0095 Re-arrest of Hamas militants freed from jail</p> <p>\u0095 Repair of desecrated holy sites</p> <p><b> Long term</b></p> <p>\u0095 Secure and internationally recognised borders, including permanent control of Jordan valley</p> <p>\u0095 Demilitarisation of any independent Palestinian state.

      "bodyText": "The Americans swept in like a firestorm yesterday, descending on the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh with all the brawn of the world's last remaining superpower. An occasional site for Middle East conflabs, Sharm el-sheikh is a bizarre mix of high stakes diplomacy and cheap package tourism. The two decades that have passed since Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai peninsula have brought a wholesale transformation to what was once a simple Bedouin village. Known for its pristine sands and crystal clear coves teeming with fluorescent tropical fish, the Sharm of today is the region's equivalent of the Costa del Sol. It is especially popular with Italian package tourists, who arrive on direct charters from Rome and Milan. At the Hyatt hotel the delegation bedded down in 300 rooms, including 18 for CNN and other television crews. Italian tourists were bundled out of their rooms, with their bags half-packed. The press secretary of the US embassy in Tel Aviv was also evicted at 2am yesterday morning. Security was tight. In the US entourage, a Clinton double rode in the black limousine. The real US president exited from a lowly jeep. At 4pm there was a flurry of excitement when President Clinton, accompanied by about 20 people, took a five-minute stroll around the golf course. At 100-yard intervals between the stubby palm trees were shorter stumps: motionless security men in suits. The Israelis arrived with their own baggage, principally the posse of spin doctors on the prime ministerial aircraft, who distributed lurid pictures from nearly three weeks of bloodshed and factsheets on the dangerous Hamas bombers freed from Palestinian jails last week. They also handed out videos of incendiary sermons from the imam of a Gaza mosque. An honour guard clad in white lined the route from the airport - their backs to the road and their eyes resolutely fixed on the desert horizon. But as the prime minister, Ehud Barak, drove to the summit centre - the Jolie Ville hotel - US and Palestinian flags were visible but not the Israeli star of David. During the last few days of tension, the Egyptian official press has returned to the language of the 1970s, before there was a peace agreement with Israel, referring to their neighbour as the \"Zionist entity\". During a three-way meeting with Mr Barak and the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, King Abdullah of Jordan said that more than a fortnight of killing in Israeli-occupied territories had badly shaken the forces of peace. \"We must build the peace camp anew among all the states including mine,\" the Jordanian ruler said, according to Israeli officials. The isolation of the place makes it easy to forget the bombs, bullets and stones that were the official reason for calling this summit - though many Arab journalists believe the real motive was to upstage the Arab summit, due to be held in Cairo this weekend. Many believe that Mr Mubarak has ambitions to turn Sharm into the Middle East's own Camp David. Four years ago it hosted a summit attended by 29 world leaders, again in response to a wave of violence - a series of anti-Israeli suicide bombings which killed 62 people. In September last year, Israelis and Palestinians signed a West Bank land-for-security agreement and earlier this month the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, met Mr Arafat in Sharm. Mr Barak had refused her invitation. The demands Israelis Short term \u0095 Arafat to order immediate halt to violence \u0095 Re-arrest of Hamas militants freed from jail \u0095 Repair of desecrated holy sites Long term \u0095 Secure and internationally recognised borders, including permanent control of Jordan valley \u0095 Demilitarisation of any independent Palestinian state.

Mr Mawdsley, 27, a Catholic human rights campaigner and university drop-out, has made it his life's mission to campaign against human rights abuses in Burma, one of the world's most repressive regimes. He was arrested just over a year ago for carrying pro-democracy leaflets. Last night the Foreign Office minister John Battle announced that the Burmese ambassador had informed him of Mr Mawdsley's imminent release and deportation to Britain. He is expected to arrive at the end of the week. Mr Mawdsley has been kept in solitary confinement in Keng Tung prison in a remote part of Burma, 400 miles from Rangoon.

      "body": "<p>Last week in an interview with the New Statesman, Lord Woolf, the Lord Chief Justice, made a series of comments concerning the newly in force Human Rights Act and the fate of a murderer convicted of two killings in the 1960s. Understandably, given his position within the legal establishment, his remarks were bland and noncommittal. Yet they have provoked immediate and intense public reaction. The reason for this sudden enthusiasm for the finer points of criminal sentencing practice is that the prisoner is Myra Hindley, still public enemy No 1 after all these years.</p> <p>Last year, Hindley lost her appeal against her \"life meaning life\" sentence in the House of Lords; she is now looking to the European Court of Human Rights to overturn that ruling. The judgment of the House of Lords is an interesting example of the way the British judiciary present their deliberations as if part of some quasi-scientific process. It is salutary to see how an impressive turn of phrase can disguise the extent to which political views and entrenched social positions are liable to cloud their decisions. The proceedings rumble on towards Strasbourg but it is difficult not to feel that in many ways the strictly legal aspects of Hindley's case are now of secondary importance.</p> <p>Hindley now stands, in the worst possible way, above the law. Her case has become the focus for our moral, political and cultural anxieties. The Moors murderers are one fixed bearing in a sea of relativist notions. Everyone knows what to think about Brady and Hindley: that they are bad. We derive a moral certainty from them which time has done nothing to wear away. Successive home secretaries have used her to shore up their own authority and there is no better illustration of the extent to which we feel free to manipulate her image than the Marcus Harvey painting exhibited three years ago as part of Sensation at the Royal Academy. The infamous photograph - bouffant peroxide hair, heavy-jawed, overweight face - was reproduced in paint using the palm prints of children. Of arguable artistic merit, its deeper significance lay in the fact that it demonstrated our eagerness to accept her decades-old mug-shot as pure art, detached from the current reality of her situation.</p> <p>This institutionalisation has led to the denial of Hindley's individuality with the consequence that injustices perpetrated against her are easier to accept. The received popular wisdom is that she is irredeemably evil and no further questions need to be asked. By identifying her as a wicked witch or a cultural icon rather than as a human being, we escape from even having to consider the hard choices regarding her future that a mature society should be capable of making. Instead we commit an appalling act. We refuse to accept the possibility of change on her part and hide our collective insecurity behind tabloid-inspired petitions and mob justice.</p> <p>Hindley's difficulties have been compounded by the fact that she is inextricably entwined with her partner in crime and that over time, the perception of the roles of Brady and Hindley has undergone a reversal. Previously Hindley, though vilified, was seen as the less willing participant, the cowed girlfriend not in full control of her actions due to Brady's overbearing personality. Recently it is Brady who has become the more acceptable of the two. By bringing a judicial review against the health authority that continued to feed him against his will, by proclaiming his wish to die, he has exhibited exactly the nihilistic longing applauded by a society that refuses to recognise the potential for contrition and reform on the part of a convicted criminal.</p> <p>In no small part, our reaction to Hindley is a paradigm of the one we have to many women who commit crime. They are caught in a double bind. They fail to live up to their idealised role as maternal homemakers. At the same time, we are fascinated by their behaviour as they act out our fantasies of risqu\u00e9 femininity. Hindley is the focus of this conflict within us regarding women. Although her role in the commission of the offences was less, her culpability is regarded as somehow greater and it is difficult to attribute this to anything other than that we regard Brady's actions as less heinous because of his masculinity. The terrible nature of her crimes makes Hindley an important gauge not just of the criminal justice process but of our culture. Our fascination with her reveals deeply conservative attitudes rarely exposed to the light of day.</p> <p>Myra Hindley is the ultimate example of the difficulty society seems to have in treating men and women on equal terms in the criminal justice process. She is not merely a woman who has committed a crime; rather there is an element of criminality inherent in her womanhood.</p> <p>This view of women who commit crime is evident at every level in the criminal justice system, from the House of Lords to magistrates' courts. And it is not only the perpetrators of crime who suffer from this discrimination. We have an ambivalent attitude towards women victims, too. It is unpleasant to observe the ill-disguised glee a small number of recent highly publicised rape acquittals have brought in certain quarters. Not only were they asking for it, but they're liars, too, seems to be the conclusion some are too ready to reach.</p> <p>Even when they are not directly involved in a crime, women are made to accept responsibility in a way that men in the same position would not be. The Daily Mirror of May 23 1981 ran the following quote from a detective in the Yorkshire Ripper case: \"I think that when Sutcliffe attacked his twenty victims he was attacking his wife twenty times in his mind.\" The article went on to say how he worshipped her and she dominated him. This was just one of many pieces that put forward Sonia Sutcliffe's failings as a wife - her inadequacies as a sexual partner, her wish not to have children, her mental health difficulties - as the direct cause of his butchery. A woman was expected in the eyes of a prurient, disapproving public not just to stand by her serial killer man but to stand in place of him.</p> <p>Whether we like it or not, the phenomenon of Myra Hindley is no longer confined to the purely legal. The paintings, the songs, the hysteria that surrounds her crimes have made her a public force. It is currently one used to reinforce harmful stereotypes and raise politicians' approval ratings. It would be better harnessed to provide lessons in how to prevent the administration of justice being crushed by the steamroller of populist pressure.</p> <p>\u0095 John Upton is a criminal barrister.</p>",

In no small part, our reaction to Hindley is a paradigm of the one we have to many women who commit crime. They are caught in a double bind. They fail to live up to their idealised role as maternal homemakers. At the same time, we are fascinated by their behaviour as they act out our fantasies of risqu\u00e9 femininity. Hindley is the focus of this conflict within us regarding women. Although her role in the commission of the offences was less, her culpability is regarded as somehow greater and it is difficult to attribute this to anything other than that we regard Brady's actions as less heinous because of his masculinity. The terrible nature of her crimes makes Hindley an important gauge not just of the criminal justice process but of our culture. Our fascination with her reveals deeply conservative attitudes rarely exposed to the light of day. Myra Hindley is the ultimate example of the difficulty society seems to have in treating men and women on equal terms in the criminal justice process. She is not merely a woman who has committed a crime; rather there is an element of criminality inherent in her womanhood. This view of women who commit crime is evident at every level in the criminal justice system, from the House of Lords to magistrates' courts. And it is not only the perpetrators of crime who suffer from this discrimination. We have an ambivalent attitude towards women victims, too. It is unpleasant to observe the ill-disguised glee a small number of recent highly publicised rape acquittals have brought in certain quarters. Not only were they asking for it, but they're liars, too, seems to be the conclusion some are too ready to reach. Even when they are not directly involved in a crime, women are made to accept responsibility in a way that men in the same position would not be. The Daily Mirror of May 23 1981 ran the following quote from a detective in the Yorkshire Ripper case: \"I think that when Sutcliffe attacked his twenty victims he was attacking his wife twenty times in his mind.\" The article went on to say how he worshipped her and she dominated him. This was just one of many pieces that put forward Sonia Sutcliffe's failings as a wife - her inadequacies as a sexual partner, her wish not to have children, her mental health difficulties - as the direct cause of his butchery. A woman was expected in the eyes of a prurient, disapproving public not just to stand by her serial killer man but to stand in place of him. Whether we like it or not, the phenomenon of Myra Hindley is no longer confined to the purely legal. The paintings, the songs, the hysteria that surrounds her crimes have made her a public force. It is currently one used to reinforce harmful stereotypes and raise politicians' approval ratings. It would be better harnessed to provide lessons in how to prevent the administration of justice being crushed by the steamroller of populist pressure. \u0095 John Upton is a criminal barrister.",

      "bodyText": "AC Grayling is in error when he states (The last word on virginity, Saturday Review, October 14) that the teenage years are biologically excellently suited to childbearing. Girls aged 15 to 19 are twice as likely to die in childbirth - never mind other pregnancy-related causes - as women in their 20s, and those under 15 are five times as likely to do so (World Health Organisation statistics). It is rather depressing to read a statement which seems to approve teenaged marriage as a good strategy for girl protection, or virginity protection, in this day and age. Many girls in west Africa and south Asia are still forced into a relationship tantamount to servitude almost - if not actually - before they have menstruated. Grayling is also wrong to suppose that throughout most of history, western European girls married very young. In the 16th century, average age at marriage for women in Europe was 24, rising to 27 by the 18th century.

      "body": "<p>There appears to be a myth that the Labour party operates democratically within its own organisation (Labour scorned for failing to select women, October 16). This is not so, as I have learned to my cost on many occasions.</p> <p>There is no hope of selecting more women candidates into safe and marginal seats while Millbank is training professional young male politicians and while CLPs are dominated by ambitious, manipulating males who blatantly discriminate against women, particularly those who have the guts to stand up to them.</p> <p>Once I was actually accused of \"going for the job\" of a twice-failed male candidate. <br><b>Shirley Haines</b><br> Leeds <br><a href=\"mailto:shirley@rochester16.freeserve. co.uk\">shirley@rochester16.freeserve. co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Labour Women's Action Committee campaigned tirelessly within the party to increase the representation of Labour women in parliament.</p> <p>Time and again, Labour proved that it was no differ ent from the vast majority of organisations: the preference for men over women (regardless of the qualities of the latter) was demonstrated almost without fail - though it faltered in unwinnable seats, where women were allowed \"to get the practice\" that somehow the men never needed. Timid mechanisms, such as one woman on every shortlist, proved hopelessly inadequate. Even when the general secretary, Larry (now Lord) Whitty wrote to constituencies urging them voluntarily to adopt all-women shortlists prior to the 1992 general election, his words went unheeded.</p> <p>It is, therefore, unsurprising that the present system of \"equal opportunities\" in selections has reversed the effects of the highly successful policy of all-women shortlists. With a gender gap remaining in the polls, we now need to move on. Ensuring that party selections, based on all-women shortlists, are controlled by constituency parties rather than party officials would restore the confidence of activists in the most successful policy ever adopted by a political party to ensure the representation of women. <br><b> Cllr Pam Tatlow </b><br> Chair, Labour Women's Action Committee</p> <p>\u0095 It would be simple to get more women elected - by applying the \"pendulum principle\".

      "bodyText": "There appears to be a myth that the Labour party operates democratically within its own organisation (Labour scorned for failing to select women, October 16). This is not so, as I have learned to my cost on many occasions. There is no hope of selecting more women candidates into safe and marginal seats while Millbank is training professional young male politicians and while CLPs are dominated by ambitious, manipulating males who blatantly discriminate against women, particularly those who have the guts to stand up to them. Once I was actually accused of \"going for the job\" of a twice-failed male candidate. Shirley Haines Leeds shirley@rochester16.freeserve. co.uk \u0095 In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Labour Women's Action Committee campaigned tirelessly within the party to increase the representation of Labour women in parliament. Time and again, Labour proved that it was no differ ent from the vast majority of organisations: the preference for men over women (regardless of the qualities of the latter) was demonstrated almost without fail - though it faltered in unwinnable seats, where women were allowed \"to get the practice\" that somehow the men never needed. Timid mechanisms, such as one woman on every shortlist, proved hopelessly inadequate. Even when the general secretary, Larry (now Lord) Whitty wrote to constituencies urging them voluntarily to adopt all-women shortlists prior to the 1992 general election, his words went unheeded. It is, therefore, unsurprising that the present system of \"equal opportunities\" in selections has reversed the effects of the highly successful policy of all-women shortlists. With a gender gap remaining in the polls, we now need to move on. Ensuring that party selections, based on all-women shortlists, are controlled by constituency parties rather than party officials would restore the confidence of activists in the most successful policy ever adopted by a political party to ensure the representation of women. Cllr Pam Tatlow Chair, Labour Women's Action Committee \u0095 It would be simple to get more women elected - by applying the \"pendulum principle\". Electoral law could be changed so that in any constituency where the current member is not seeking re-election only candidates of the other gender may stand. For example, the successor to Alan Clark as MP for Kensington and Chelsea would not have been Michael Portillo; it would have been a woman. In every constituency, the pendulum would result in a man-woman sequence of MPs over time. The same approach could be adopted for local authorities, the devolved assemblies and the European parliament. Keith Rogers Mancheste Klrogers@tesco.net \u0095 I fully support the drive to get more women into parliament. However, I find myself strangely unconcerned by the news that the Tory selection procedure may have \"missed many Thatchers\". If this system could be developed to miss Portillos and Tebbits too, it might contain the kernel of a good selection process. Patrick Vallance London rmhapav@ucl.ac.uk \u0095 You might have mentioned that the Lib Dems are the only party to have increased the number of women in the Commons since May '97, the only party to have offered a woman candidate for mayor of London, and the only party to offer a woman candidate in the West Bromwich by-election.

On the fifth anniversary of the event billed as the Million Man March, thought to be the largest gathering of black people in Washinton, DC, Mr Farrakhan was only partly successful in his attempt to recreate the remarkable impact of the 1995 march. Even so, the gathering gave a more accurate picture of modern American diversity than many of the mainstream political events in this year's presidential election campaign. The thousands of people who rallied in the Mall came not so much to press for any particular political or legislative objective as to celebrate their own numbers and diversity, so often marginalised by the choreography and language of electoral politics. From the steps of the US Capitol building, where Congress is still grappling with the minutiae of the budget, thousands of people from different ethnic backgrounds could be seen sitting on blankets, in deckchairs, or milling about in colourful groups. The over-arching purpose of the event, organisers say, was to celebrate and strengthen the family unit. \"People of God can come together despite our diversity, for the noblest of causes - the family,\" said Rashul Muhammad, the son of the Nation of Islam founder, Elijah Muhammad. \"I think this is a once-in-a-lifetime blessing,\" said Darryl Tucker, a black American from Detroit, there with his wife and three children. \"I think the spirit that comes from this will help families around the world come closer and be better people.\" \"This march is about people from all walks of life coming together and putting an emphasis on family,\" said Sharon Gilmore, also from Detroit. \"I like to see everybody mix\". Unlike earlier Farrakhan-inspired events, the Million Family March was far more inclusive, both ethnically and in terms of gender. While the attendance was predominantly black, there were plenty of white families in the crowd, and a succession of other minorities and religious leaders - even, controversially, some Jewish groups - all had their place on the programme. \"Give the Jewish family a big hand,\" announced the white Christian leader Reverend Michael Jenkins, as he went through the list of the event's supporters. The crowd responded enthusiastically to his call. The march began before dawn, with Muslim prayers and religious speakers calling for unity and family renewal. \"We need to realise that we are one,\" the black American Catholic leader George Stallings told them. As the day wore on, and the crowds swelled, there were speeches from leaders such as Rev Al Sharpton and Martin Luther King III, the son of the murdered civil-rights leader. Even the convicted murderer Mumir Abu-Jamal addressed the crowd in a video from his death-row cell. \"The next great march will be on November 7 when we march to the polling booths,\" Mr Sharpton told the crowd. The climax of the proceedings came when Mr Farrakhan conducted a \"sacred wedding blessing\" delivered to several thousand couples, most of whom were \"reaffirming\" their marriage vows. The ceremony was a relection of the Nation of Islam leader's recent - and controversial - alliance with the Unification Church of the Rev Sun Myung Moon, which has long been fond of staging mass weddings.

In a speech that effectively heralded the start of his election campaign, Mr Hague built on his determination to depict his party as one of social inclusion - a theme repeatedly stressed at the Conservative conference this month and exemplified by Michael Portillo, the shadow chancellor, who spoke of his Spanish father being an asylum seeker. But, while conveying this softer image, Mr Hague in sisted the Tories would not \"be a prisoner to political correctness\" and were opposed to positive discrimination for such groups. His comments, made in Cardiff, came as he tried to marry the rival factions of his party by pledging to \"champion mainstream values\" while respecting the rights of minorities. In an attempt to unite the liberal and authoritarian elements within the Tories - elements at war during the recent controversy over Ann Widdecombe's drugs policy - he insisted his party could maintain a tough line on tax, crime and asylum while campaigning in a \"very robust and Conservative way\" on improving education, health care and inner-city deprivation. He added: \"We believe passionately in the personal and economic freedom of the individual, but we also understand that as individuals we owe rights to others and that we live in a society with a history and traditions. \"I see no contradiction, and nor do most people, in saying of course I'm not going to dic tate how every person should lead their life, but I will change the tax system to support marriage because all the evidence tells us that stable marriages lead to stable societies. \"I see no contradiction, and nor do most people, in saying we celebrate the different ethnic communities that make up Britain but we won't be a prisoner to political correctness.\" Mr Hague also announced he would spend the next few months \"cover[ing] more miles and meet[ing] more people in the most energetic, enthusiastic, widely travelled campaign in living memory\". His only fixed diary date would be the weekly prime minister's question time. \"When the time comes for Tony Blair to start his election campaign, our campaign will have been on the road for months already,\" he added.

Three weeks ago, Payne made a last visit to the Liberal Democrats' conference at Bournemouth. By now partly in a wheelchair, he was in constant demand from friends and colleagues. They had all benefited from his clear-sightedness and refusal ever to panic. Payne himself summed up his style in a story about an interview with Ashdown in the mid-1990s. Not wishing to waste time, the leader set the rendezvous at an airport. In his haste not to miss the plane, Ashdown, first walking, then sprinting, left Payne and the journalist way behind. \"Shouldn't we run and catch him up?\" asked the concerned hack. \"I don't think so,\" came Payne's reply. \"We've plenty of time and, anyway, I've got his ticket.\" Payne is survived by his wife, Jo Whittingstall, whom he married in 1963, and his four sons. Mark Payne, political aide, born August 6 1939; died October 12 2000",

      "body": "<p>Riot police were mobilised yesterday to protect McDonald's restaurants as thousands of demonstrators in 20 Italian cities declared war on the fast-food chain.</p> <p>In Milan, marchers flung raw meat through police lines, splattering restaurant windows with blood. But most of the protests were more peaceful, with crowds in Rome, Naples, Palermo and Turin chanting: \"Better a day of tortellini than 100 days of hamburgers.\"</p> <p>Organisers of the protests have said they will intensify their campaign, predicting that Italy will overtake France in the strength of its opposition to the chain.</p> <p>The government promised to set up a task force to draw up a charter of principles for multinational companies. The charter, to be agreed with trade unions, was intended to defuse hostility by acting as a \"civic defender\", said the industry minister, Enrico Letta.</p> <p>He added: \"It would be a mistake to create a climate of tension. McDonald's is one of the few foreign companies bringing investment to our country.\"</p> <p>A coalition of leftwing radicals, family-run bars and trade unions hopes to reverse, or at least slow down, McDonald's planned opening of 200 outlets in the next two years. It says the chain is destroying consumer choice, exploiting staff andselling unhealthy food.</p> <p>McDonald's responds that it is employing 15,000 young people and has become hugely popular with families since opening its first restaurant in Rome 15 years ago.</p> <p>The countrywide protests were bolstered by controversy over the chain's treatment of staff.</p> <p>Last week, 20 employees in Florence walked out in protest at an \"intimidating\" work climate. Around the same time a manager in Florence raised hackles by disciplining an employee for sipping a soft drink without permission. The worker complained to his union, which complained to the labour minister, Cesare Salvi.</p> <p>After meeting the minister, the president of McDonald's in Italy, Mario Resca, promised an inquiry. \"The respect and valour of each of our employees is of the highest priority to McDonald's,\" he said, adding that the new outlets would create 10,000 jobs.</p> <p>The chain, which has 272 restaurants in Italy, suffered another blow when trade unions mobilised to defend five employees reprimanded for eating chocolate chips.</p> <p>Earlier this month Fausto Bertinotti, leader of the Refounded Communist party, led 100,000 protesters to a McDonald's branch in Piazza della Repubblica in Rome. Branding its hamburgers a symbol of Americanisation and globalisation, he said he understood why people physically attacked the restaurants.</p> <p>The Turin-based Slow Food movement, which champions traditional cooking and eating, joined yesterday's protests. Its spokesman, Silvio Barbero, told the Corriere della Sera newspaper: \"It forces consumers to taste the same hamburger in Tokyo, New York, Helsinki and Palermo. A McDonald's hamburger doesn't evoke regional tastes or sensations, and its gastronomic origin is impossible to define.\"</p> <p>Ghettoised for years with a combined market share of 5%, McDonald's and Burger King resolved to bring Italy up to the European average of 25%. Food purists said Italians would never succumb, but they were wrong, with pasta salads and pizza slices boosting the chains' popularity.</p> <p><b>Digested history of McProtest</b></p> <p>\u0095 In the 1980s, McDonald's faced protests in the west after rumours that its beef came from cattle raised on cleared rainforest in South and Central America. The firm quickly clarified the situation - it demands proof from its suppliers that they use only long-established cattle ranches and 100% EU beef. But the myth lives on.</p> <p>\u0095 In Britain, the 'David and Goliath' McLibel case began in 1994 and saw the company successfully sue Dave Morris and Helen Steel for allegations they made in a leaflet in the late 80s. It became the longest libel case in English history, lasting over two and a half years and costing McDonald's \u00a310m.</p> <p>\u0095 In summer this year, a French farmer, Jose Bove, roused Gallic sympathy when he was jailed for three months for attacking a half-built McDonald's in Millau, southern France. He was protesting against US duties on French cheese and the 'McDomination of the world'.</p> <p>\u0095 It took 13 years for McDonald's to establish a presence on Hampstead High Street, north London, after celebrity opposition from the likes of Melvyn Bragg, Tom Conti and Margaret Drabble</p>",

      "bodyText": "Riot police were mobilised yesterday to protect McDonald's restaurants as thousands of demonstrators in 20 Italian cities declared war on the fast-food chain. In Milan, marchers flung raw meat through police lines, splattering restaurant windows with blood. But most of the protests were more peaceful, with crowds in Rome, Naples, Palermo and Turin chanting: \"Better a day of tortellini than 100 days of hamburgers.\" Organisers of the protests have said they will intensify their campaign, predicting that Italy will overtake France in the strength of its opposition to the chain. The government promised to set up a task force to draw up a charter of principles for multinational companies. The charter, to be agreed with trade unions, was intended to defuse hostility by acting as a \"civic defender\", said the industry minister, Enrico Letta. He added: \"It would be a mistake to create a climate of tension. McDonald's is one of the few foreign companies bringing investment to our country.\" A coalition of leftwing radicals, family-run bars and trade unions hopes to reverse, or at least slow down, McDonald's planned opening of 200 outlets in the next two years. It says the chain is destroying consumer choice, exploiting staff andselling unhealthy food. McDonald's responds that it is employing 15,000 young people and has become hugely popular with families since opening its first restaurant in Rome 15 years ago. The countrywide protests were bolstered by controversy over the chain's treatment of staff. Last week, 20 employees in Florence walked out in protest at an \"intimidating\" work climate. Around the same time a manager in Florence raised hackles by disciplining an employee for sipping a soft drink without permission. The worker complained to his union, which complained to the labour minister, Cesare Salvi. After meeting the minister, the president of McDonald's in Italy, Mario Resca, promised an inquiry. \"The respect and valour of each of our employees is of the highest priority to McDonald's,\" he said, adding that the new outlets would create 10,000 jobs. The chain, which has 272 restaurants in Italy, suffered another blow when trade unions mobilised to defend five employees reprimanded for eating chocolate chips. Earlier this month Fausto Bertinotti, leader of the Refounded Communist party, led 100,000 protesters to a McDonald's branch in Piazza della Repubblica in Rome. Branding its hamburgers a symbol of Americanisation and globalisation, he said he understood why people physically attacked the restaurants. The Turin-based Slow Food movement, which champions traditional cooking and eating, joined yesterday's protests. Its spokesman, Silvio Barbero, told the Corriere della Sera newspaper: \"It forces consumers to taste the same hamburger in Tokyo, New York, Helsinki and Palermo. A McDonald's hamburger doesn't evoke regional tastes or sensations, and its gastronomic origin is impossible to define.\" Ghettoised for years with a combined market share of 5%, McDonald's and Burger King resolved to bring Italy up to the European average of 25%. Food purists said Italians would never succumb, but they were wrong, with pasta salads and pizza slices boosting the chains' popularity. Digested history of McProtest \u0095 In the 1980s, McDonald's faced protests in the west after rumours that its beef came from cattle raised on cleared rainforest in South and Central America. The firm quickly clarified the situation - it demands proof from its suppliers that they use only long-established cattle ranches and 100% EU beef. But the myth lives on. \u0095 In Britain, the 'David and Goliath' McLibel case began in 1994 and saw the company successfully sue Dave Morris and Helen Steel for allegations they made in a leaflet in the late 80s. It became the longest libel case in English history, lasting over two and a half years and costing McDonald's \u00a310m. \u0095 In summer this year, a French farmer, Jose Bove, roused Gallic sympathy when he was jailed for three months for attacking a half-built McDonald's in Millau, southern France. He was protesting against US duties on French cheese and the 'McDomination of the world'. \u0095 It took 13 years for McDonald's to establish a presence on Hampstead High Street, north London, after celebrity opposition from the likes of Melvyn Bragg, Tom Conti and Margaret Drabble",

      "bodyText": "The Bosnian Serb general accused of masterminding Europe's worst atrocities since the second world war yesterday claimed he was emotionally attached to the very people his troops are said to have massacred five years ago. Launching his defence at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in the Hague, General Radislav Krstic argued that his upbringing showed that he was hardly the type of man to indulge in the ethnic cleansing of Muslims. Gen Krstic is accused of playing a leading role in the wholesale slaughter of at least 7,500 Muslim men and boys in the now infamous enclave of Srebrenica in the summer of 1995. It was supposed to be a UN safe haven but the 100-strong Dutch military unit of peacekeepers there to protect the largely Muslim population abandoned the town and its unfortunate inhabitants to the advancing Bosnian Serb army. Mr Krstic - whose 15,000 strong unit, the Drina Wolves, is said to have played a pivotal role in the ensuing massacres - is the highest-ranking Bosnian Serb military officer to go on trial in the Hague. He is charged with genocide and crimes against humanity. The prosecution has already shown pictures of mass graves in fields overflowing with corpses and bones, and has claimed that Gen Krstic and his men tried to cover up the atrocities by later exhuming the bodies and burying them elsewhere. But Gen Krstic protests his innocence and pins the blame on his superior, General Ratko Mladic, who is still at liberty somewhere in the former Yugoslavia. Prosecutors have shown footage of Gen Krstic entering Srebrenica alongside Gen Mladic. In an attempt to portray himself as a man untouched by ethnic hatred, Gen Krstic, 52, yesterday described how he found the breakup of the former Yugoslavia \"horrible\" and said he was \"emotional\" when Muslim and Serb soldiers had to part company to form separate opposing armies. Dressed in a dark suit and wearing gold-rimmed glasses, Gen Krstic limped to the witness stand. \"We all went to school together, socialised together and had great respect for each other,\" he said of the Muslim soldiers. \"We hoped we would see each other again and hoped we would work together again.\" He then claimed he had as sumed command of the Drina Wolves almost two weeks after the Muslim enclave had fallen to the Bosnian Serbs. His lawyer also argued there was a parallel chain of command \"concealed\" from the general. However, the killings took place between July 11 and July 17 1995, and prosecutors have already produced a copy of a decree signed by Gen Mladic showing that Gen Krstic took charge of the Drina Wolves on July 13. Gen Krstic's lawyer was yesterday adamant that he would prove that this was not the case. \"We will prove that Gen Krstic and the lower-ranking officers did not stain the honour of Serb officers. We will prove that with documents of the VRS [Bosnian Serb Army].\" The Srebrenica massacres are viewed as the worst atrocities of the 1992-95 Bosnian war and have been described by UN judges as a scene from hell written on the darkest pages of human history. The Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic - also indicted for war crimes but like Gen Mladic still at liberty - has singled out Gen Krstic for praise, calling him \"a great commander\" who did \"an extraordinary job\". The war crimes case is a real test for the UN since it has so far failed to secure a genocide conviction. Gen Krstic faces life imprisonment if the final verdict, due in the first half of next year, is guilty.",

The deal ended a week of obstruction by the Socialist party, the dominant group in the Milosevic regime. The 18-party alliance of the new president, Vojislav Kostunica, had threatened to bring hundreds of thousands of protesters back on to the streets if the Socialists tried to block change. The general strike and mass protests that brought down Mr Milosevic on October 5 are now known as the Bulldozer Revolution because the machines were used to smash their way into the state-run radio and TV headquarters and the federal parliament. Mr Kostunica's allies in the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) said they would bring the bulldozers back if the Socialists - the largest party in the Serbian government - refused early elections. Under the deal for an early poll, which the DOS is confident of winning, the Socialists will retain the post of Serbian prime minister in the transitional government. But the prime minister will have to act in consensus with two deputy prime ministers. One will be from the DOS and the other from the Serbian Renewal Movement of another opposition figure, Vuk Draskovic, who said the deal meant \"the end of Serbia as a country of organised terrorism\". The Serbian police, information, justice and finance ministries are to be shared between appointees from the Socialist party and from the DOS. The nationalist hardliner Vojislav Seseslj, who holds a large block of seats in the Serbian parliament, refused to take part. The deal should restore some of the momentum that seemed to be lost last week when the DOS failed to consolidate its original victory of late September. Mr Kostunica has also been slow in appointing a prime minister for the Yugoslav Federation and a new Yugoslav government, partly because of disagreements with Milo Djukanovic's government in Montenegro.

But I was warned off it,\" Reed explains. </p> <p>Although this made him abandon the idea of concentrating on the murder and its aftermath, he was still keen to make a film portraying the lives of people who grew up in the area where such events happened. However, few wanted to talk on camera. \"I didn't want a procession of faceless silhouettes,\" he says. \"It wouldn't have satisfied me. I want to make films that look good.\" </p> <p>He also rejected the idea of just dramatising the world he wanted to portray. \"At the moment, television drama seems to me incredibly unimaginative, with its potted ideas, gestures and mannerisms. It's lost the connection with real life.\" So he came up with a possibly unique solution - an improvised drama, based on the stories of the people he'd been talking to - and with them playing the fictitious characters themselves. \"I wanted to tie it back to an authentic reality. It was important to me that the characters should be based on the people who were going to be in the film.\" These men knew about Liverpool's underworld, although there is no suggestion that they had been involved in serious crime, or the 1995 murder itself. </p> <p>In preparation, Reed spent a year talking to the men he wanted to involve. \"A lot of them are terribly interested in movies,\" he says. \"They re-enacted them in their real lives, or even passed off recycled film scenes as their own experience. Fortunately, though, I'd seen the films too.\" </p> <p>Once Reed had gained the men's trust and convinced them he wasn't an undercover policeman, he began to discuss how they were going to tackle the filming. \"I had to be honest. I told them I wasn't going to glamorise them - it wouldn't be a film about men with flash cars. This was a film which would depict the grim reality in which they live.\" </p> <p>Of course it wasn't just these \"people with an alternative moral code\" - as he describes them - that Reed had to keep on board. \"Channel 4 took a big leap in the dark, too. We couldn't be sure that any of the guys would even turn up on the first day of shooting.\" </p> <p>He also had to worry about possible tabloid press attention for what he was doing. \"I'm unperturbed about the News Of The World getting hold of it, because there are no skeletons in my cupboard. I told the people involved in the film that there was no money in it for them. I'm worried that someone will take a phoney story to the papers about the project - when we were in Liverpool there were rumours about huge payments I was supposed to have made.\" </p> <p>But what, does he feel, was the motivation for these men to appear on camera? \"I think they couldn't quite believe that I was there asking them to do it,\" says Reed. \"But they also felt that they belong to a part of the country that's been misrepresented by the media for too long.\" </p> <p>He is bracing himself for a strong reaction from his film-making peers when the film premiers. \"There will be a degree of bafflement,\" he admits, \"and lots of questions as to who these people are, but I hope that most people will recognise the integrity behind my desire to show the consequences of violence.\" </p> <p>He rejects any charges that he is exploiting his subjects for his own aggrandisement. \"It's nothing overtly attention-seeking,\" he argues. \"In fact it's just the opposite. The question is whether it's valuable to have films on television which engage with different ways of life. These people exist, and they're more prevalent and powerful in our society than most of us would ever imagine.\" </p> <p>Hilary Bell, the Channel 4 commissioning editor overseeing the film, is sending out a clear message about what she considers to be its prime driving motivation. \"I think it's a very moral film, with a clear documentary purpose - to examine how the surge in both cocaine and gun use has changed the business of crime in England's major cities. I'm not saying that these people are angels,\" says Bell, \"but they don't hold convictions for serious violent crime.\" </p> <p>And, like Reed, Bell doesn't seem too worried about the controversial reception that might be lying around the corner for Shooters. \"I don't have sleepless nights about it,\" she says. \"How does it go? Fasten your seatbelts - it's going to be a bumpy ride...\" </p> <p>\u0095 Shooters will be screened at the Seventh Annual Sheffield International Documentary Film Festival on Thursday at 9.30pm and Friday at 10pm.

And, in contrast to the dreary backslapping/ stabbing of most celebrity memoirs, you've got to hand it to the man in question, what with his being the first black actor to win an Oscar, and the former Bahamian ambassador to Japan. The bald truth... Oh, and if you overhear a lilting guitar refrain straight from the South African townships in the next few days, that'll be sanctions-busting Paul Simon, girding himself for three consecutive nights at the Hammersmith Apollo, starting next Monday. Whether he'll be performing selections from his ill-fated musical The Capeman (sample review: \"like watching a mortally wounded animal\") remains, as yet, unclear. Ol' Blue Eyes, Jr... Which just leaves time to mention Tina Sinatra, spawn - as you might expect - of the late Frank. Over on Monday to plug her book My Father's Daughter, the little minx is promising a host of \"revealing and shocking\" insights into pops, although given the kind of material that's already public knowledge, you have to wonder what she could possibly mean...",

      "body": "<p>Next week, Rachel Whiteread's Holocaust Memorial will be unveiled in Vienna's Judenplatz. The memorial is a kind of library, its proportions based on a typical room in a building facing the square. Standing on a raised concrete dais, the memorial's outer surface is covered in what appear to be thousands of books, spine inwards, so that what one sees are the edges of the covers and the closed pages. A mute memorial, in other words, for the People of the Book. The doors to this library are sealed shut. Around the dais is a frieze of names, of the camps and sites where the genocide took place. On one face is a commemoration to the 65,000 Austrian Jews who perished. The inscription is in German, Hebrew and English. </p> <p>Whiteread's memorial has been subject to the intrigues and arguments of the city's commercial, political and religious interests. It has raised criticism on all fronts - from the fact that Whiteread is neither Jewish nor Austrian, to its possible negative effect on local trade and complaints about the loss of parking spaces for the square's residents. What was once a congested thoroughfare is now a pedestrianised oasis of calm. </p> <p>\"I'm really looking forward to seeing the memorial being absorbed into the city,\" says Whiteread, \"to seeing it in guide books. I'm wondering how they'll describe it.\" </p> <p>The refurbishment of Judenplatz includes access to the underground remains of the synagogue that originally stood there, and a refurbished Judaic centre for the ultra-orthodox Misrachi community, which will contain a Holocaust museum. \"It was always clear that the archaeological remains of a former synagogue, which burned to the ground in 1421, lay under the site. Our initial proposal took it into account,\" says Whiteread. \"There were also disputes within the Jewish community about the nature of the memorial itself. But you can't make public sculpture by consensus. Nevertheless, the work is a political animal: the elections are coming up.\" </p> <p>As the far right, xenophobia and anti-semitism re-emerge in Europe - synagogues burning in Paris, the rise of the Vlaams Blok in Belgium - Whiteread's memorial is likely to become a conspicuous target. \"There's going to have to be 24-hour security of some sort. The surface has some anti-graffiti stuff on it. We've also cast extra books for the surface. If someone sprays a swastika on it we can try to scrub it off, or the books can be moved to break up the sign. A few daubed swastikas would really make people think about what is happening in their society, their culture. I certainly don't want to encourage it, but if it happens, it happens.\" The defacement would signal something, just as the graffiti on Whiteread's House, her 1993 cast of an entire Victorian house in a condemned terrace in London's east end - \"WOT FOR\", \"WHY NOT\" and \"Homes for all - black and white\" - registered the temperature of local feeling. </p> <p>Part of the inspiration for the memorial came from the second world war bunkers in Normandy. \"It is a library, but it looks like a bunker,\" Whiteread says. \"Even the excavations underneath are bunker-like. It is also very brutal. I was thinking of brutalist architecture. But essentially, I tried to make something sombre and poetic. I've since been asked to make several other memorials but I've turned them down. I'm not in the memorial business.\" </p> <p>Since being awarded this public commission in 1996, Whiteread has completed an acclaimed transparent cast of a rooftop water tower in New York, which stood on the skyline with other water towers, advertising signs, satellite dishes and aerials. \"It was about trying to make something which almost wasn't there. In certain light conditions it is almost invisible. People haven't been able to find it. I like that. It's being relocated to the roof of the Museum of Modern Art now, a very different context. </p> <p>\"There were people who wanted to buy the water tower and take it to California, but I was adamant that it should stay in New York,\" she continues. \"When I made House I had a couple of offers to chop it into sections and re-erect it somewhere else. I've got a few chunks from it, like bits of the Berlin Wall. They're meaningless. Displacing things is odd.\" </p> <p>Whiteread's sculpture for the plinth in Trafalgar Square - a translucent resin replica of the plinth itself, to be mounted, inverted, atop its granite twin - should have gone on view this month, but has been held up because of technical problems with the resin cast. She is preparing a major travelling exhibition for the Guggenheim museums in New York, Berlin and Bilbao next year, when she will also hold a retrospective exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London, scheduled for May. </p> <p>\"I wanted to make something architectural for the Guggenheim, to relate to Frank Gehry's building in Bilbao and to the Frank Lloyd Wright building in New York. I decided to use my own architecture. I'm casting an apartment, which was in part of the building I've just bought in the east end.\" This building was also once a synagogue, a fact that Whiteread finds oddly circular and propitious. </p> <p>She is casting a series of rooms, \"with the spaces between the walls, the plaster and lath, so one will have glimpses through the slats of the lights, the plug sockets, the switches. Everything will be there, but you won't be able to see all of it. We had to work out how to remove the cast without destroying the room. It took four months to figure out how to do it.\" The sculpture, a descendant of Ghost (1990) and House, is technically complex; it uses a plaster developed for the Disney corporation to make fake rock faces. The resin she used for Water Tower was derived from a compound used in film special effects. </p> <p>All this to make things which are, she insists, true to their original form. Forms that - from the spaces around staircases, to abandoned flats, bookcases and light fittings - have an understated resonance. Her sculptures, in other words, are as much about their anonymous past in the everyday world, and their future as loci of memory and symbolism, as they are about objects, materials, planes and masses. </p> <p>\"I've been casting floors for the Serpentine Gallery show - again from the synagogue - in metal,\" says Whiteread. \"The idea is that they'll be rusted then waxed, and you can walk on them, so the raised parts will get polished by visitors' feet. Of course it refers to Carl Andre: it's a kind of double-double memory.\" </p> <p>Whiteread's role in the production process of the work at times appears as much about management and quality control as it is the hands-on efforts of the traditional sculptor. \"It is hard to persuade the technicians not to prettify the elements. I give them something to cast that looks like a piece of crap and they try to make it look nicer. They can't believe I want it just the way it is. I'm also working with a local architectural cast iron foundry. They had no idea of what I'm doing or why. Then one day someone recognised me, and everyone turned and said: 'You're that woman who made House.' \" </p> <p>When the controversy about House was at its height, Whiteread would sit in her car at a little distance from the sculpture, looking at the crowds who came to see it through a tear in a newspaper. As with the Holocaust Memorial, she wanted to keep her distance from the brouhaha. But fame catches up with you. She's even been mistaken for Charlie Dimmock by the star-struck. We recently found ourselves in a dingy Hackney strip-tease pub (don't ask why), where girls gyrated beneath a gorgeous, but filthy, Victorian ceiling.

For one, the weather switched from temperatures in the 90s to an onslaught of snow and wind that froze the trees and cacti into glassy ice structures. The other events were no less spectacular, if less unexpected. Some 1,400 people attended the annual open house weekend held by the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, a town of approximately 2,500 inhabitants set high in the Chihuahuan desert. Although some of the events were unravelled by the tempestuous weather, the inauguration of Dan Flavin's Untitled (Marfa project) dazzled all the more brilliantly. </p> <p>One of three works to be completed posthumously (he died in 1996), it is Flavin's largest work and ranks among the most ambitious large-scale works of the 20th century. It is in good company, too. The Chinati Foundation, created by Donald Judd, a dominant figure in minimalist art throughout the past 30 years, is committed to installing and preserving works of art, often too large, fragile or complex to be held in normal museums. Judd also wanted to give substantial showings of a few artists' work rather than the myriad museum anthologies sparsely covering too many artists. </p> <p>In order to realise this vision, Judd bought 340 acres of land just outside Marfa in 1979 with the assistance of the Dia foundation. The site's existing buildings once formed a US military camp, and met Judd's need for large, functional spaces. A line of U-shaped barracks is flanked by rectangular mess halls. Two artillery sheds dominate the site and house Judd's series of 100 aluminium boxes, made specifically for the site. </p> <p>Flavin drew up plans for work at Chinati during the 1980s, but due partly to the expense and scale of the project, and partly to some complicated wrangling between Judd and Flavin in their last years, it has taken until now to realise the plans. </p> <p>Like much of the work at Chinati - the foundation has housed pieces by Ilya Kabakov, Claes Oldenburg, and Richard Long - Untitled (Marfa project) utilises the space and permanence afforded by Judd's vision. Six barracks have been converted to house 336 fluorescent lights in four colours. Each building has its windows blocked out, bar the two that are farthest from the lights. At the top of each wing of the U-shape, the building is divided into two corridors by a wall that slants at 76 degrees to the floor. The sides of the corridors also slant. </p> <p>The fluorescent lights, always two different colours backing up against each other, form blockades, either at the ends of these corridors or in the middle. You enter each building at a distance from the lamps, where the light is benign. Up close the light is stringent, the stripes falling at the same angle as the walls, recalling a shaft of sunlight or rain. There is a simple sequence: pink and green lamps are used in the first two buildings, yellow and blue in the third and fourth, and all four colours in the last two. The colours carry distinct sensations: the pink is kitsch, the green is similarly artificial but has a stranger, more sonorous tone; the blue is sky blue when you look directly at the lamps but deepens to an ultraviolet in the darkened corridors. The yellow modulates to amber from its buttercup lamp. </p> <p>The repetition that is involved in seeing all six buildings, entering all 12 wings, sharpens your awareness of the size and proportion of the buildings, and provides an interesting response to Judd's own work at Chinati. Where Judd's use of aluminium in the 100 box structures plays with the light passing through the wall-to-floor windows, Flavin's work restricts the natural light and favours instead the play of fluorescent light against white walls. Where Judd's installation encompasses the surrounding landscape, Flavin directs the viewer towards the enveloping artifice. </p> <p>The contrasts and compliments that pass between the works at the Chinati Foundation testify to Judd's curatorial foresight. And that there are plenty of serendipitous aspects to viewing the work at Chinati, not least the weather, makes the arrival of Flavin's new work an all the more captivating experience.</p> <p>\u0095 For details of guided tours of the Chinati Foundation, call 001 915 729 4362.</p>",

      "bodyText": "AKA: Ottomar Rudolphe Vlad Dracula. Age: A bit long in the tooth. Wait a minute, did you say... Dracula? Oh yes. Kretzulesco is the last living member of the famous Dracula clan. And he's coming to Britain. W ... w ... why? For the past six years, the prince has lived in the small East German village of Schenkendorf, by turns attempting to forge a living in catering, entertainment and antique dealing, and by opening his home as a tourist attraction. However, he has now been hounded out by superstitious locals who have attempted to torch his castle, graffitied neo-Nazi slogans and swastikas on the walls, and delivered death threats. What kind of death threats? He hasn't specified, but one suspects it was a bit more serious than a few cloves of garlic shoved through his letterbox. So he's pulling up stakes and moving to Blighty? Well, he also has the option of a monastery in Bavaria. But the Prince believes that \"Britain has lots of castles and old stately homes which could benefit from being turned into a Dracula home\". Hasn't he got more important things to be doing? Such as? Oh, y'know, sleeping in coffins, nibbling young maidens on the neck, that kind of thing ... Actually, these days he's too busy with his charity work. He recently fronted a campaign by the German Red Cross to encourage people to give blood. Please tell me you're joking. Oh no, I'm deadly serious. The Germans made donations in droves after his campaign for the Red Cross. Now the Prince hopes we will be equally bitten. I mean smitten. But isn't he worried about BSE? Surely you mean a steak through the heart? Do say: \"Caped crusader.\" Don't say: \"Where the hell's Buffy when you need her?\"",

It was built for \u00a34.5m, a fraction of the cost of most of its rivals. For the first time the public was invited to vote a building on to the shortlist. The London Eye, designed by Marks Barfield, was expected to walk away with this vote, but although the big wheel did make it on to the shortlist, the surprise popular vote was for the Sainsbury supermarket on the Greenwich peninsula, south London, designed by Chetwood Associates, which recently also collected a Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors building of the year award.",

The comments, by Susan Stobbs, the admissions director, came after Cambridge published its first table detailing how many places went to state school applicants in 1999. It showed they gained at least 50% of places at half the 24 main undergraduate colleges. The figures uncovered a sizeable variation with King's taking 79% of its class of 1999 from state schools, compared with 39% at Gonville and Caius and Corpus Christi. Only Magdalene and St Catharine's gave at least half their places to comprehensive pupils despite having more private school applicants. Ms Stobbs said that if pupils looked at the figures in isolation, they might be put off applying to the very colleges that were working hardest to attract them. The row about elitism erupted in May when Mr Brown criticised the rejection of the state school pupil Laura Spence by Magdalen College, Oxford. Ms Stobbs said: \"Our great fear this year is that it will make it harder to achieve what we want because people don't like being used as a political football. \"The average intake from state schools has been going up slowly but steadily over the last 12 years. \"Oxford have announced their number of applications are down and we sense it is the same with us.

It may be that she is in fact on top of her work. </p> <p>If her teachers feel that she's not doing enough to achieve her target grades, perhaps the time has come to sit down with your daughter and encourage her to think about her future. Does she hope to go to university? If so, what grades does she need? </p> <p>Students find it difficult to take responsibility for their own learning, so negotiate with her about what you can do to help, for example offer to buy support texts, provide a suitable study area and maybe offer rewards in return for her agreeing to a routine that includes a balance of studying and socialising, with limited part-time work. Emphasise the ultimate goal of university and the extra freedoms associated with it. </p> <p>We've found recently that a useful exercise for our sixth form students was to ask them to complete a time study for an average week, encouraging them to realise exactly what proportion they are spending on their studies. If you find that you make little progress with this approach, contact the school again - they really can help and support you. </p> <p> <strong> Ann Limb, Principal of Cambridge Regional College</strong> <br> </p> <p> It's easy to forget how traumatic the transition from compulsory to post-16 education can be, particularly as it involves adapting to a totally independent approach to learning. To assume that this can happen within a few weeks at the beginning of term is rather unrealistic! It's more organic and develops over time. </p> <p>Many young people actually feel a little abandoned, especially if the move is also to a different environment where new relationships between staff and students have to be established. Parents can also feel neglected and/or anxious about how far to encroach upon their child's \"space\". </p> <p>We've tried to overcome this by inviting parents and students to an induction session, where we explain the courses and the expectations/requirements of students. We also give an overview of where their studies could lead them, be it university or employment. This is quite a short period in the student's life, so it can be very motivating to give it a sense of purpose. </p> <p>Don't be afraid to contact staff if you don't know how to be more involved without encroaching upon your daughter's independence.

      "bodyText": "Lucy Peters, sixth form teacher at Fullbrook School in Surrey It's hard to generalise about which approach to use with laid-back 17-year-olds as they're all motivated in different ways, but my initial response would be to contact your daughter's school to find out exactly how her teachers feel she's getting on. It may be that she is in fact on top of her work. If her teachers feel that she's not doing enough to achieve her target grades, perhaps the time has come to sit down with your daughter and encourage her to think about her future. Does she hope to go to university? If so, what grades does she need? Students find it difficult to take responsibility for their own learning, so negotiate with her about what you can do to help, for example offer to buy support texts, provide a suitable study area and maybe offer rewards in return for her agreeing to a routine that includes a balance of studying and socialising, with limited part-time work. Emphasise the ultimate goal of university and the extra freedoms associated with it. We've found recently that a useful exercise for our sixth form students was to ask them to complete a time study for an average week, encouraging them to realise exactly what proportion they are spending on their studies. If you find that you make little progress with this approach, contact the school again - they really can help and support you. Ann Limb, Principal of Cambridge Regional College It's easy to forget how traumatic the transition from compulsory to post-16 education can be, particularly as it involves adapting to a totally independent approach to learning. To assume that this can happen within a few weeks at the beginning of term is rather unrealistic! It's more organic and develops over time. Many young people actually feel a little abandoned, especially if the move is also to a different environment where new relationships between staff and students have to be established. Parents can also feel neglected and/or anxious about how far to encroach upon their child's \"space\". We've tried to overcome this by inviting parents and students to an induction session, where we explain the courses and the expectations/requirements of students. We also give an overview of where their studies could lead them, be it university or employment. This is quite a short period in the student's life, so it can be very motivating to give it a sense of purpose. Don't be afraid to contact staff if you don't know how to be more involved without encroaching upon your daughter's independence. Parents are extremely important partners in the process of learning.

This type of person always finds everything fascinating and often says something like, \"Well I wish I could do this course.\" Call it tiredness or downright stupidity but I always seem to find myself laughing nervously and saying, \"Well you can, we run it as an evening class. Here take this leaflet.\" I can hear myself saying it. I mean, I can always hear myself saying it on the night as I am usually the last lecturer left in the room and the college has gone eerily quiet. Well, I can't pretend these things won't happen again this year. Maybe my wife is right about the suit, but if I keep applying the ointment I am sure I will get through another open evening.",

It will be expected to coordinate and improve existing efforts, presently organised by such bodies as the Further Education Funding Council, Basic Skills Agency and the Further Education Development Agency - and to make sure the emerging Learning and Skills Councils stay on message too. </p> <p>The national strategy is the direct consequence of last year's powerful Moser Report and an earlier funding council survey. Both revealed disturbingly poor levels of basic skills teaching and, worse, insufficient numbers of people even vaguely motivated to do something about their own plight. </p> <p>Unpublished inspection findings of basic skills teaching in 54 colleges this year show that over two-thirds of literacy and numeracy lessons - whether as part of discrete courses, vocational programmes or additional learning support - were judged satisfactory. But the Further Education Funding Council chief inspector, Jim Donaldson, who carried out the survey, warns there is a worrying degree of complacency abroad. Colleges, he says, are being \"over-generous\" in the way they assess their own achievements. Virtually half think they are doing an outstanding job - almost twice the proportion reckoned to be in the same category by funding council. \"This,\" Donaldson says, \"at a time when college staff have become much more self-critical. </p> <p>\"We are reaching a turning point in tackling illiteracy and low numeracy. We now know what needs to be done. We have the willingness and the ability to perform the cultural revolution that's so vital.

But it is certain that the Learning and Skills Council and its 47 local varieties will need to take note of the new strategy, not least because a substantial part of the government's \u00a3160m Standards Fund is being earmarked for basic skills. </p> <p>A \"quality initiative\" to raise teaching standards through a programme of staff training and organisational development is being led by the funding council until its demise next April. Over 1000 college staff will be invited to training sessions starting next month. A possibly controversial element of this initiative will be the piloting in the new year of a national test that eventually could be taken by all further education students, not just those with basic skills deficiencies. This will be intended to be a national benchmark to help give employers a clearer understanding of potential recruits' abilities. </p> <p>The basic skills tsarina has been charged with accelerating the delivery of the quality initiative as part of the national strategy. This will set targets, including getting 50% of adults qualified to the accepted standard or above by 2002 (the present figure is 46%) and a 7% reduction in non-learners. </p> <p>Pember, whose brief transcends the boundaries of government departments, doesn't quibble about the challenge facing her. \"We can't have a learning society with 7m not participating. We have set up more learning environments than any country in the world, but students are not coming to us in sufficient droves. </p> <p>\"We need to change people's attitudes to learning, which is really difficult. Learning programmes must be responsive to what people want and when. They must be really exciting.\" </p> <p>She also wants to ginger support among employers by trying to convince far more that their profit margins will nose-dive unless they take staff training seriously \"and help us assess what needs to be done\". An obvious example was enabling cleaners and other caretaker staff unable to read or add up to acquire these skills so they could use the internet to order materials rather than continue to make more costly phone calls. </p> <p>As far as colleges go, Pember is pushing at a wide open door. The enthusiasm for the task in hand is mutual. Even a reputable institution like Liverpool Community College, given top marks for quality and standards in a recent funding council inspection, is planning to restructure its basic education faculty in order to respond to the tsarina's message. Marie Allen heads a faculty that plans to double to 12 the number of outreach learning centres in the city. She explains: \"We need a fresh start. The needs of basic skills five years ago are not those of today.\" </p> <p>The secret is to make sure improvements are properly managed and that the illusion of quick fixes is dismissed.

I have my syllabus always to hand. </p> <p>The trouble is, the syllabus for disablement hasn't been written yet.

It's not till something denies you your legs, that you realise your brain can be paralysed without them. The battle that I've been waging, shoring up my mind, my capacity as an intellectual, against the ravages of a disease that crumbles away my body bit by bit, demands energy that is rightfully due to my children, my husband, my students. Over the past year they've got used to my tottering gait, first with one stick and then with two. They've adapted to my inability to join in all the activities we used to share. My family good- naturedly fetch and carry for me. My students look the other way when I trip up.

Perhaps my vision of the past is clouded or I'm forgetting the further education expectation that you sort it out for yourself. Of course, I've found ways.

Maybe appearing in a wheelchair will be liberating. Soon, I expect I'll be rolling confidently down the zig-zag one in 12 slope provided as secondary access to the main door of college, calling breezily to other part-time colleagues whose names I don't know, getting them to open doors for me. I'll be blas\u00e9 about using the lift that fits a wheelchair inside, so long as you don't need to turn and press the lift buttons, the same lift that breaks down more often than I care to think about. I'll be able to tell those full-time colleagues I hardly know, who contort their faces into masks of concern when they see me coming and ask \"How are you coping?\" where they can stuff their sympathy. </p> <p>Maybe. The odds are that it won't happen like that. I'll be making it up as I go along, taking it one step, or one wheel-revolution at a time.

I'll be blas\u00e9 about using the lift that fits a wheelchair inside, so long as you don't need to turn and press the lift buttons, the same lift that breaks down more often than I care to think about. I'll be able to tell those full-time colleagues I hardly know, who contort their faces into masks of concern when they see me coming and ask \"How are you coping?\" where they can stuff their sympathy. Maybe. The odds are that it won't happen like that. I'll be making it up as I go along, taking it one step, or one wheel-revolution at a time. Much as I like syllabuses, I need to learn to learn without one. \u0095 Pauline Eyre teaches German to evening classes at a Yorkshire college. She was diagnosed as suffering from MS in 1986.",

Malcolm Wicks, minister for lifelong learning, will today announce a review of the 75 organisations, which vary enormously in size, clout and the influence they wield in the sectors they cover. A considerable boost in the numbers of youngsters completing modern apprenticeships will be high on the government wish list in return for more cash. Currently 60% of these training programmes don't get finished. Every NTO will be required to produce a \"workforce development plan\" setting out the skills needs in the sector it covers. Some of the 75 NTOs, which vary enormously in size and clout, will be expected to do more to get themselves taken more seriously by the employers in their industries. And some will have to consider merging to survive. All of the organisations, whose role is to boost the skills and competitiveness of their sectors, will be required to submit to scrutiny by a government-appointed panel.

For example, if Britain could close the labour productivity gap with Germany it would boost the country's output by \u00a350bn. Wicks is expected to follow the recommendation in the third report by the National Skills Task Force this summer, which urged government to review its funding to National Training Organisations to ensure they are up to the job of increasing the numbers getting training in their sectors. The hope among his audience is that he will announce at least a doubling of the \u00a310m that NTOs currently receive. Ministers will be told of the difficulties facing some of these organisations, set up in the dying days of the last Tory government to replace the 150 Industry Training Organisations. Many are small - 29 have fewer than five staff - and suffer poor recognition among the sectors they cover. Barely one in 10 employers \"can provide an unprompted description of an NTO\", according to Garry Hawkes, chair of the national council.

Vividly diverse in terms of language and culture, Asia is home to the world's most rapidly expanding populations, many of them still rural. This decade, they represent the world's biggest potential market of consumers for higher education. </p> <p>In Asia, the need for higher education, in one form or another, encompasses perhaps 500m people at a time when personal wealth, mobility, migration and internet usage are also generally increasing. </p> <p>Analysts say that if Asia were to use conventional solutions to meet current demand, the region would need to increase its spending on higher education by at least 40%. That leaves governments no choice but to look for solutions outside the traditional, elite systems of instruction which are often hundreds of years old - some bequeathed by colonial overlords and others of local origin. In Hong Kong itself, distance is a matter for geography books: here 6.4m inhabitants are crowded into just 380 square miles. The territory is at the other end of the Asian demographic spectrum from western China or rural India, where poor villagers are spread out over large distances.</p> <p> Hong Kong is the world's second-most densely populated urban centre after Singapore, with some 16,840 people per square mile. Compared with some countries, the percentage of adult students studying by internet and other unconventional modes of higher education in Hong Kong remains pretty low: just 21%, compared with 40% in western Europe and more than 60% in Scandinavia. But unlike Hong Kong's other eight conventional universities, the Open University accepts all comers, or at least as many as it can serve. That policy contrasts with those of older institutions, such as the Chinese University of Hong Kong, which admit only 18% of applicants. \"We allow people a second chance,\" says British-born Richard Armour, registrar at the Open University. Even so, he says, \"Second chance doesn't mean second-rate. It can't - not in status-conscious Hong Kong. We would be out of business if it did.\" </p> <p>More than 100,000 students have studied at the Open University, about a tenth earning degrees. From offering the most restricted opportunities for higher education, Hong Kong became, in the past decade, \"a place where any 18-year-old who can hold a pen can obtain a diploma\", in the words of one newspaper editorial. </p> <p>The growth is particularly evident in business schools. Before the government began examining their credentials, more than 60 fast-track MBA programmes were being offered in the territory, most by offshore institutions based in Britain and Australia, and some with dubious, if any, accreditation. \"We became very concerned at some of the overseas offerings, and still are, up to a point,\" says Ronnie Carr, another Briton at the Open University who is dean of its education and languages department. \"Some of these institutions have seen Hong Kong as a good place to cut corners,\" he adds, \"especially given that this is a culture where students like to finish things quickly.\" </p> <p>Still, the arrival of the \"cowboys\", as Carr describes them, was a compliment, of sorts, for Hong Kong. \"It showed that this is an ideal society for educational opportunities,\" he says, mentioning the ease of English-language communication among other cultural characteristics. </p> <p>Some outside observers say the Open University does have its weaknesses. \"If I have anything to say against the Open University,\" says Cheng Kai-ming, a professor of education at the University of Hong Kong, it is \"probably that it hasn't been ambitious enough, especially at a time when whoever truly taps into the mainland-Chinese market will become a very, very significant player in higher education.\" </p> <p>In China, a nation of 1.3bn, the number of students working toward a master's degree in business administration this year is just 2,000. </p> <p>Even so, Open University administrators cite a variety of difficulties in penetrating the mainland market. According to the \"one country, two systems\" concept under which the transfer of rule from Britain to China took place in 1997, for economic purposes the Chinese regard Hong Kong as just another country, albeit one with special cultural ties. But in the past three years the university has pushed to have at least some of its programmes accepted by the Chinese government. Today, more than 1,000 of its students are from the mainland. </p> <p>Does Armour worry that the Open University could get trampled in the rush to the mainland, particularly if American or British institutions join in? \"I don't think so,\" he says, after a moment's thought.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Warwick was just another newish university until it discovered Smirnoff. Vodka didn't exactly keep it afloat, but it did provide uplifting and continual waves of extra funding. It ensured that the university's greenfield site on the edge of Coventry became home to the first en-suite student residences, one of the most significant business archives in the UK and the biggest multi-arts centre outside the Barbican in London. </p> <p>No other British university has been fortunate enough to retain a relationship with a private philanthropic foundation over such an extended period. In 35 years, Warwick has received the equivalent of \u00a319m at this year's prices. And all because of Jack Martin, the man who invented such hindrances to clear-headed thinking as the the Bloody Mary, the Screwdriver, the Moscow Mule and the Black Russian cocktail. </p> <p>Martin's sister, Helen, set up a charitable trust to spend some of the fortune that Jack built. Born in Coventry, he moved to the United States in 1927 and, 12 years later, bought the rights to Smirnoff Vodka for $14,000. By the 1960s, when Warwick was founded, the company was selling 14m crates worldwide. </p> <p>Helen continued to live at the family home in Kenilworth, a mile or two across the fields from Warwick University, until she died in 1988. By that time, her trust had given away many millions, not only to the university but also to a number of local and national charities. She was an unmarried woman who loved pedigree poodles and classical music. Indeed, she had her own seat in the concert hall at the arts centre. \"I met her there only once,\" says Michael Shattock, who retired last year as the university's registrar. \"She was a quiet and unassuming lady who was very anxious that her contribution should have no publicity.\" </p> <p>Twelve years after her death, Shattock felt that the time was right to put the record straight, officially, and give credit where credit was due. He has just published a 25-page glossy brochure outlining the history of the Martin family's contribution and the impact it has made on Warwick's development. \"What private money gives you is the betterment factor,\" he says. \"It marks you out. What we've got out of this are things which couldn't have been done with state money. It only happens in a few places and it's a matter of luck and the personalities fitting together.\" </p> <p>Two very different personalities were key figures in this saga. Jack Butterworth, fellow of New College, Oxford, was about to take up a job as Warwick's vice-chancellor in 1963 when he was invited to address the Coventry Chamber of Commerce. It was there that he met an accountant called Phil Mead, who was a trustee of the Martin family's fledgling charity. Mead was keen on football and would become president of Coventry City. At their first meeting, he told the prospective vice-chancellor: \"Universities are like football clubs. You have to be in the first division.\" </p> <p>Were he still at Warwick today, Lord Butterworth would be pushing for a European place at the top of the premiership. Back in 1963, he demonstrated some nifty footwork when Mead revealed that the education department had still not responded to the trustees' offer to set up an Anglo-American scholarship fund. Would Warwick like the money instead? It would. </p> <p>\"It was this speed of reaction, informality of style and ambition to support new projects that brought the two sides together so quickly and in such a trusting relationship,\" Shattock writes. The initial donation of \u00a35,000 was followed by more. Much more. So much more that when they crossed the Atlantic in 1964 and visited the Hopkins (arts) Center at Dartmouth College, Mead apparently said to Butterworth: \"I think we'll have one of these.\" </p> <p>Ten years later, stage one was opened with a concert conducted by the great American composer Leonard Bernstein. When Butterworth left Warwick in 1985, Shattock took over dealings with the trustees and the university continued to make the most of its good fortune. </p> <p>The en-suite student residences, for instance, became the basis for a lucrative summer conference trade. Matching \u00a3500,000 from the trust and building a modern records centre was enough to persuade BP to choose Warwick ahead of Cambridge to house its sought-after business archives. But developing a reputation for entrepreneurial shrewdness was not to the taste of some academics. \"Warwick University Ltd,\" was the contemptuous label pinned on it by one of its readers, the historian EP Thompson. </p> <p>\"A left-wing fabrication,\" Shattock retorts. \"We've put the money we've generated back into the university.\" He goes on to say: \"Higher education has to be a mixed economy. It's important that the state continues to provide funding, but you can only be a world-class institution if you can continue to attract other resources.\" Cheers, Jack. </p> <p> <strong>Vices behind vice-chancellors</strong><br></p> <p> Bristol University owed its foundation to the munificence of tobacco magnate Henry Overton Wills. After years of attempts to create a university in the city, his announcement of a \u00a3100,000 gift provided a charter was granted within two years proved the necessary spur. It was followed by Bristol granting a penny rate to the venture to bring in \u00a37,000 a year. The Wills Memorial Building (right) looks set to outlast Bristol's declining cigarette industry. </p> <p>The delicious smell of breweries still hangs over Edinburgh, but a more tangible tribute to the demon drink is McEwan Hall (right), where thousands of graduands troop through degree ceremonies each year. When Edinburgh University expanded in the late 19th century, Disraeli's government was prepared to help but not to fund a graduation hall.

      "bodyText": "Warwick was just another newish university until it discovered Smirnoff. Vodka didn't exactly keep it afloat, but it did provide uplifting and continual waves of extra funding. It ensured that the university's greenfield site on the edge of Coventry became home to the first en-suite student residences, one of the most significant business archives in the UK and the biggest multi-arts centre outside the Barbican in London. No other British university has been fortunate enough to retain a relationship with a private philanthropic foundation over such an extended period. In 35 years, Warwick has received the equivalent of \u00a319m at this year's prices. And all because of Jack Martin, the man who invented such hindrances to clear-headed thinking as the the Bloody Mary, the Screwdriver, the Moscow Mule and the Black Russian cocktail. Martin's sister, Helen, set up a charitable trust to spend some of the fortune that Jack built. Born in Coventry, he moved to the United States in 1927 and, 12 years later, bought the rights to Smirnoff Vodka for $14,000. By the 1960s, when Warwick was founded, the company was selling 14m crates worldwide. Helen continued to live at the family home in Kenilworth, a mile or two across the fields from Warwick University, until she died in 1988. By that time, her trust had given away many millions, not only to the university but also to a number of local and national charities. She was an unmarried woman who loved pedigree poodles and classical music. Indeed, she had her own seat in the concert hall at the arts centre. \"I met her there only once,\" says Michael Shattock, who retired last year as the university's registrar. \"She was a quiet and unassuming lady who was very anxious that her contribution should have no publicity.\" Twelve years after her death, Shattock felt that the time was right to put the record straight, officially, and give credit where credit was due. He has just published a 25-page glossy brochure outlining the history of the Martin family's contribution and the impact it has made on Warwick's development. \"What private money gives you is the betterment factor,\" he says. \"It marks you out. What we've got out of this are things which couldn't have been done with state money. It only happens in a few places and it's a matter of luck and the personalities fitting together.\" Two very different personalities were key figures in this saga. Jack Butterworth, fellow of New College, Oxford, was about to take up a job as Warwick's vice-chancellor in 1963 when he was invited to address the Coventry Chamber of Commerce. It was there that he met an accountant called Phil Mead, who was a trustee of the Martin family's fledgling charity. Mead was keen on football and would become president of Coventry City. At their first meeting, he told the prospective vice-chancellor: \"Universities are like football clubs. You have to be in the first division.\" Were he still at Warwick today, Lord Butterworth would be pushing for a European place at the top of the premiership. Back in 1963, he demonstrated some nifty footwork when Mead revealed that the education department had still not responded to the trustees' offer to set up an Anglo-American scholarship fund. Would Warwick like the money instead? It would. \"It was this speed of reaction, informality of style and ambition to support new projects that brought the two sides together so quickly and in such a trusting relationship,\" Shattock writes. The initial donation of \u00a35,000 was followed by more. Much more. So much more that when they crossed the Atlantic in 1964 and visited the Hopkins (arts) Center at Dartmouth College, Mead apparently said to Butterworth: \"I think we'll have one of these.\" Ten years later, stage one was opened with a concert conducted by the great American composer Leonard Bernstein. When Butterworth left Warwick in 1985, Shattock took over dealings with the trustees and the university continued to make the most of its good fortune. The en-suite student residences, for instance, became the basis for a lucrative summer conference trade. Matching \u00a3500,000 from the trust and building a modern records centre was enough to persuade BP to choose Warwick ahead of Cambridge to house its sought-after business archives. But developing a reputation for entrepreneurial shrewdness was not to the taste of some academics. \"Warwick University Ltd,\" was the contemptuous label pinned on it by one of its readers, the historian EP Thompson. \"A left-wing fabrication,\" Shattock retorts. \"We've put the money we've generated back into the university.\" He goes on to say: \"Higher education has to be a mixed economy. It's important that the state continues to provide funding, but you can only be a world-class institution if you can continue to attract other resources.\" Cheers, Jack.

Knowing this, I suggested that the university authorities should apply for slightly higher funding for both languages for the following four years, in order to establish temporary lectureships.

Her new series, Women in Science, on BBC2 culminates on October 26 with talks from a panel of four women who have made their mark in the scientific community. \"What is now important is to get more women on strategic and decision making committees,\" said Dr Nancy Lane, a cell biologist at Cambridge University, and one of the four panelists, \"Women need to be involved in the bodies that are dictating policies in universities over the next 10 years.\"",

Looking at ways of easing the change is a project that Jean Jameson, head of learning support and special educational needs co-ordinator at Nailsea School, has been working on for the past year. </p> <p>\"Primary school is much more intimate and familiar than secondary school,\" she explains. \"The children suddenly go from having just one or two teachers and classrooms to maybe a dozen. It can be daunting to meet so many different teachers and to have to move around the school at every bell.\" Her idea for making the transition easier was partly based on an American book about high-school reform. The basic principle, she explains, involves reducing the number of different adult-child interactions by giving year seven groups fewer different teachers. Each class tutor teaches the children in their class, not only for their specialist subject but also for personal, social and health education. The year seven teachers will also receive extra training in counselling skills and student-support strategies. </p> <p>Working in this way, explains Jameson, doesn't just reduce the stress on the children. It also gives the teachers a chance to get to know their pupils. \"In that transitional year, it's an opportunity for the children's needs to be recognised and for them to feel valued and feel that they have become part of the school and that they have kept their identity.\" </p> <p>Smoothing the passage in this way helps parents too, she adds. \"At parents' evenings, the parents are so upset if they find one of their child's teachers hadn't realised they had a problem such as mild dyslexia. But some teachers might see 500 pupils in a week. The teachers simply can't remember everything about every pupil.\" However, she says, a year spent getting to know each individual in the new intake can help. \"It's a foundation for a good relationship with the pupil. The teacher will have knowledge of strengths and of any special needs - and can pass that on to colleagues.\" </p> <p>Jameson believes that this kind of approach is particularly important as modern testing becomes more demanding for pupils, teachers and parents alike. As she was speaking, Nailsea School's new intake of year seven pupils, just five weeks into the term, were taking a cognitive ability test in the hall below, all 240 of them packed in together, following microphoned instructions from the dais at the front of the room. \"There is more pressure on children today,\" says Jameson. \"Even in these early stages, there is an ethos of testing; you tell the children not to worry, but they do.\" </p> <p>The transition project is backed up by other initiatives. David Turner has special responsibility for induction of new pupils. Himself a former pupil at Nailsea, a comprehensive in a pleasant conurbation near Bristol with around 1,300 pupils, he has spent his entire teaching career at the school and knows the area well. He visits the local primary schools to talk to year six pupils, and there is a programme of visits, activities and workshops for prospective pupils. At the end of the summer term comes \"moving up\" day, where the junior school pupils come to spend a day at Nailsea, go into their tutor groups, and have their first taste of working to a timetable. </p> <p>Jameson, helped by a grant from the Human Scale Education organisation, hoped to take the transition scheme even further, and have as much as a third of school time in the first year taken by one teacher. \"We'd hoped that each teacher would be class tutor, teach their specialist subject plus PSHE, and teach at least one other subject as well.\" She was disappointed when prospective parents consulted over a possible pilot scheme on a larger scale said they would prefer their children to have different teachers for every subject right from the start. Perhaps, she says philosophically, the scheme needed more PR. </p> <p>Which it may yet receive; for initial results this year are promising. The year seven tutor team, says Jameson, is working well together, the pupils have settled in and the atmosphere is very positive. She hopes all will continue to go well, because she believes that a scheme like this can replace something crucial that has been edged out by timetable pressures and the sheer size of modern schools: a sense of community. </p> <p>\"School used to be the first alternative to family,\" she says. \"Children today aren't involved in the human undertones of school life.

Ten minutes later, I emerge from the school office with a vast and bewildering bundle of guides, circulars, bulletins, regulations, reports, directives, policy statements and handbooks. Mr Richardson's secretary, Joan, who moonlights as clerk to the governors, is vague about the training courses when I enquire.

      "body": "<p>Half-term approaches and, for thousands of children, that will mean a school trip. For most parents these trips are routine. But, in the wake of last week's tragic accident in Yorkshire, parents will, yet again, be asking themselves whether their children are safe. </p> <p>Statistically the answer is a resounding yes. Accidents are mercifully rare and literally thousands of visits go ahead each year without incident. But that will be no comfort at all to the parents of Rochelle Cauvet and Hannah Black, who waved their children off on a geography field trip to the Yorkshire Dales and then, days later, had to face every parents' worst nightmare when police called to say their daughters were missing. </p> <p>For Sharon Carter, the news reawakened all too recent memories of the police call to her home last June, when she was told of the death of her 13-year-old daughter Gemma on a school trip to France. </p> <p>\"I'm absolutely horrified that it can happen again,\" she said. Gemma was a pupil at Cockburn High School in Leeds, just a few miles away from the Royds School which organised the Dales field trip. \"No lessons seem to have been learnt from Gemma's death,\" said Carter. In fact, Leeds did issue new guidelines to schools this year, but experts in outdoor education argue that the existence of detailed guidance has failed to prevent tragedy after tragedy and that it's time for some schools to face up to the fact that they do not have the expertise to lead activities in the outdoors. </p> <p>\"This all feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\" says Outward Bound's Steve Howe. \"I can only hope parents aren't discouraged from allowing their children to experience adventurous outdoor activities; that was certainly the case for a period after the Lyme Bay incident.\" </p> <p>The Lyme Bay incident in 1993 was a watershed in outdoor safety. Four Dorset sixth-formers died on what should have been a simple canoeing trip. Tragedy unfolded because two young instructors had been put in a situation beyond their competence. They were not qualified to lead groups on the sea, flares were not carried, and lifejackets worn by the group were not inflated. </p> <p>Attention soon switched to the running of the St Albans centre the group had started from, and managing director Peter Kite was convicted of manslaughter. </p> <p>A public outcry ensued. Eventually the government was persuaded to bring in legislation to control the industry. </p> <p>The result was the Activity Centres (Young Persons Safety) Act, which allowed for the inspection and registration of activity centres. A new inspection authority was created, the Adventurous Activities Licensing Authority (AALA), and the scheme became operational in October 1997. </p> <p>But, from the very beginning, voices within the industry complained that the government was legislating for the wrong sector. Activity centres had a good safety record, as an inspection by the Health and Safety Executive after Lyme Bay confirmed. Accidents were far more likely to take place on amateur expeditions led by voluntary organisations - and on school trips. </p> <p>Since Lyme Bay, there have been no fatal incidents involving children at activity centres, but voluntary organisations and schools, which are not inspected, have suffered several avoidable tragedies. </p> <p>In July 1996 Caroline Dickinson was murdered on a school trip to Brittany. The hostel used by the school party did not belong to the International Federation of Youth Hostels, basic security was lax and Caroline's murderer was able to simply wander in and out of the building. </p> <p>A year later, 10-year-old Laura Zielinski died on a school trip to Wales. The talented young dancer from the Midlands was paddling in the sea on Shell Island near Harlech when waves carried her away. Teachers with the group had no lifesaving qualifications and had not sought advice about the beach before allowing children into the water. Shell Island's owners told the Guardian at the time that they would have warned against swimming at the spot where Laura drowned, and an activity centre based on the island cancelled swimming activities on the day after a safety inspection ruled that the sea was too rough. </p> <p>In 1998 three children from St James' School in Bolton died when their minibus crashed in France. The school party had left Lancashire on a coach fitted with seat belts, but on arrival in France the tour operator asked the English driver to use a left hand drive minibus with no seatbelts to take the children up into the mountains. Unused to the vehicle, the driver lost control on a steep, narrow road and the bus rolled down the hill. The inquest was told that the three would have survived had they been wearing seatbelts. </p> <p>The last 18 months have seen four further deaths, with two fatalities in Snowdonia on scout-led expeditions, the death of 15-year-old Rachel Williams from Penzance on a school skiing holiday and Gemma Carter's death in France. </p> <p>Some would argue strongly against a culture of safety and security which, they argue, is denying children opportunities for adventure and excitement. Climber Sir Chris Bonington, in an interview in the Times Educational Supplement, railed against the effects of a culture of safety at all costs. \"After every crisis,\" he said, \"there are screams to make things safer, but at what cost to education?\" </p> <p>Last year, adventurer David Templeman-Adams told the Royal Geographical Society: \"We are becoming a nation of softies ... surrounding our children in cotton wool ... they will not be able to cope with risk when they encounter it as adults.\" </p> <p>But the point being missed by these gung-ho adventurers is that deaths have occurred in circumstances which any competent leader would have avoided. Ten-year-old Johnathan Attwell died on Snowdon in circumstances that have led to charges of manslaughter against the scout leader in charge of the group, but the case has yet to be heard. </p> <p>Rachel Williams was not wearing a helmet, despite a recommendation by the US resort. She hit a tree on the slopes in exactly the same circumstances and at the same resort where singer Sonny Bono died the previous year. </p> <p>Gemma Carter's death is alleged to have happened after a group of children were allowed to leave the main party and go paddling by themselves. Sixteen months later, Sharon Carter is still awaiting the results of inquiries into the death of her daughter. </p> <p>It's too soon to speculate about the detailed causes of last week's tragedy, but the available facts point towards a failure of judgement on the part of the group leaders. </p> <p>Leeds will be holding their own inquiry into the deaths, but education director Keith Burton told reporters: \"This part of the education programme was classified as a low-risk activity; a water check and advance weather checks would not be part of such a low-risk activity. We need to ascertain exactly what has happened.\" </p> <p>Gorge walking is normally a safe, fun activity enjoyed by thousands of children every year at licensed centres all over the UK. It involves an upstream paddle over rocks and boulders. </p> <p>Instructor Andy Colau lives in Stainforth and holds an AALA licence for gorge walking in the beck where the Leeds children died. He would expect children to be kitted out with helmets and waterproofs and under normal conditions would be quite happy to take a group up the gorge. But normal conditions involve river levels of less than six inches in depth. </p> <p>\"Anything near the knees is far too deep,\" he says. \"This is swift-moving water. Knee-deep, there would be a force of half a ton for every metre width.\" </p> <p>Colau saw the school groups on the day, when they looked \"wet and bedraggled\". It had been raining \"bloody hard\" that morning and had he been aware that they planned to walk the gorge he would have warned against it. Instead, as a member of the local rescue team, he spent much of last week searching for the bodies. </p> <p>There is a lot of anger in the area about the waste of life and an equal sense of frustration amongst outdoor professionals who know that the inevitable result of the tragedy will be for parents to shy away from such trips. </p> <p>Outward Bound is particularly annoyed because several reports referred to the activity as an \"outward bound\" type adventure. The trust operates four licensed centres across the UK and is incensed that its safety record should be besmirched by association with the deaths. </p> <p>Along with other providers, the trust would like to see schools and voluntary organisations subject to the same regime of inspection that they themselves have to undergo. </p> <p>Outward Bound's Steve Howe wonders whether cost savings had any impact on schools. A week in a licensed centre starts at around \u00a3200 per pupil. Some school trips are offered for half this amount. Not surprisingly, perhaps, some schools often opt to run activities themselves rather than use a licensed centre. </p> <p>\"There is a real and obvious temptation for teachers to minimise the cost of such courses,\" Howe said. \"That has inherent dangers if it means shortcuts on safety. You can't just assume that because you are a good classroom teacher you have the skills to lead a group in the outdoors.\" </p> <p> <strong>Keep your child safe: parents' questions answered</strong><br></p> <p> Schools trips are hugely beneficial in all sorts of ways and few would want to see them banned.

Their website <a href=\"http://www.aala.org\">www.aala.org</a> gives details of all licensed centres and the activities they are accredited for. It is possible to run some activities (low-level walking, quad biking) without a licence; in those cases schools need to contact the local outdoor education adviser to check that the centre is safe. </p> <p><strong> What about going abroad?</strong> <br> </p> <p> Reputable companies that operate abroad, such as PGL, adhere to the same standards as licensed centres in the UK. Other holiday operators, running language tours, for example, do not need a licence. Here parents should ask whether teachers have detailed knowledge of the area they are planning to visit.

      "bodyText": "Half-term approaches and, for thousands of children, that will mean a school trip. For most parents these trips are routine. But, in the wake of last week's tragic accident in Yorkshire, parents will, yet again, be asking themselves whether their children are safe. Statistically the answer is a resounding yes. Accidents are mercifully rare and literally thousands of visits go ahead each year without incident. But that will be no comfort at all to the parents of Rochelle Cauvet and Hannah Black, who waved their children off on a geography field trip to the Yorkshire Dales and then, days later, had to face every parents' worst nightmare when police called to say their daughters were missing. For Sharon Carter, the news reawakened all too recent memories of the police call to her home last June, when she was told of the death of her 13-year-old daughter Gemma on a school trip to France. \"I'm absolutely horrified that it can happen again,\" she said. Gemma was a pupil at Cockburn High School in Leeds, just a few miles away from the Royds School which organised the Dales field trip. \"No lessons seem to have been learnt from Gemma's death,\" said Carter. In fact, Leeds did issue new guidelines to schools this year, but experts in outdoor education argue that the existence of detailed guidance has failed to prevent tragedy after tragedy and that it's time for some schools to face up to the fact that they do not have the expertise to lead activities in the outdoors. \"This all feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\" says Outward Bound's Steve Howe. \"I can only hope parents aren't discouraged from allowing their children to experience adventurous outdoor activities; that was certainly the case for a period after the Lyme Bay incident.\" The Lyme Bay incident in 1993 was a watershed in outdoor safety. Four Dorset sixth-formers died on what should have been a simple canoeing trip. Tragedy unfolded because two young instructors had been put in a situation beyond their competence. They were not qualified to lead groups on the sea, flares were not carried, and lifejackets worn by the group were not inflated. Attention soon switched to the running of the St Albans centre the group had started from, and managing director Peter Kite was convicted of manslaughter. A public outcry ensued. Eventually the government was persuaded to bring in legislation to control the industry. The result was the Activity Centres (Young Persons Safety) Act, which allowed for the inspection and registration of activity centres. A new inspection authority was created, the Adventurous Activities Licensing Authority (AALA), and the scheme became operational in October 1997. But, from the very beginning, voices within the industry complained that the government was legislating for the wrong sector. Activity centres had a good safety record, as an inspection by the Health and Safety Executive after Lyme Bay confirmed. Accidents were far more likely to take place on amateur expeditions led by voluntary organisations - and on school trips. Since Lyme Bay, there have been no fatal incidents involving children at activity centres, but voluntary organisations and schools, which are not inspected, have suffered several avoidable tragedies. In July 1996 Caroline Dickinson was murdered on a school trip to Brittany. The hostel used by the school party did not belong to the International Federation of Youth Hostels, basic security was lax and Caroline's murderer was able to simply wander in and out of the building. A year later, 10-year-old Laura Zielinski died on a school trip to Wales. The talented young dancer from the Midlands was paddling in the sea on Shell Island near Harlech when waves carried her away. Teachers with the group had no lifesaving qualifications and had not sought advice about the beach before allowing children into the water. Shell Island's owners told the Guardian at the time that they would have warned against swimming at the spot where Laura drowned, and an activity centre based on the island cancelled swimming activities on the day after a safety inspection ruled that the sea was too rough.

How does it feel to be one of those British black children who is let down by British schools? We asked 18-year-old Aaron Dixon to tell us. This is his story. </p> <p>\"I liked nursery school. I lived alone with my mum and she taught me to read very young so I was top of the class. I liked learning, and I used to go home and tell mum all about what we'd done each day. I was active and noisy but I was popular, too, and I remember the headteacher, Miss Marsden, seemed to really like me. </p> <p>I went on to primary school in Muswell Hill, London, but I stayed less than a year because my mum changed jobs and couldn't collect me from school. I was sent to stay in Wolverhampton with my aunt. There, I went to a Catholic primary with a strict regime. The teachers were kind, they really showed you love. I remember one especially - he was safe, he would take me to play golf and was always there if I had a problem. Being taught by him was stimulating; I felt I could move forward and learn at my pace. I was always fairly high up in class. </p> <p>I only stayed at this school nine months, though, because mum wanted me back in London. So I started at a junior school in Haringey. I didn't find it easy to settle. I wanted to see my dad but he didn't take an interest in me. I became troublesome around this time. When I was nine, mum put me into foster care. She said she couldn't control me. I became disruptive at school - talking in class, mouthing back at teachers when they chastised me and playing tricks all the time. I also became the class joker making other kids laugh. </p> <p>Part of it was that my head was muddled with what was going on in my life, but also I was so bored in school. My mum had taught me a lot of stuff and I knew so much that we were being taught and I didn't want to sit through listening to it all again. But there was no scope for working separately from the others. I'd start to write an essay and lose interest and screw it up. Science was the one thing that really grabbed me - I wanted to be a rocket scientist and I was desperate for books to read on that. No one gave me any. </p> <p>My parents were from Jamaica and my mum used to give me books to read about black history - but there was nothing like that at school. It was all Columbus and stuff. I would have liked a black teacher in school teaching about black culture, - once a month, say. It would have been interesting for white kids, too. But all my schools felt like white places where there happened to be black kids who had to fit in. </p> <p>The school knew that I was fostered and that the placements kept breaking down, and the head was sympathetic. He would sit me down and talk to me and try to help, but I was too far gone at that time. They brought in psychiatrists and social workers but what I really wanted was my mum - I used to cry down the phone asking if I could come home to live but she said no. I don't really speak to her any more. </p> <p>At 11, I went to a comprehensive in Hornsey. I was happy enough for the first few months because it was a new place and a challenge to find my way in it, but then it became boring just spending all of every day in lessons where I didn't feel I was learning much. I was trouble then, I know - disruptive, loud-mouthing teachers. I was always being sent out of class - it seemed to me that more black kids than white were sent out and there was definitely a feeling in this school that black kids were the most trouble and less likely to learn. </p> <p>I met up with older boys who were out of class too, and already into crime. They took me under their wing and became like my family. They really cared for me. We would register at school in the morning and then bunk for the day and go down the West End stealing. Nobody at the school said anything even though I was not in class day after day. By the end of the year I had stopped going altogether. </p> <p>Later, I went on to White Hart Lane comprehensive but I hated that, too. I didn't feel accepted by anyone. I liked English and my English teacher used to let me write stories and give me good marks, but most of the time I just felt hated. </p> <p>Then one day I was going into the playground to meet my cousin who was coming to see me when I saw a teacher had him on his back and was saying \"call the police\". I pulled the teacher off and put him against a wall and told him to leave my cousin alone. I was suspended indefinitely for that and sent to a unit for excluded children. </p> <p>The teachers there treated you like an adult, they were on Christian-name terms and I felt I could talk to them. There were black people as well as white running it and there weren't all the petty rules and regulations like at school. I decided there I'd take the opportunity of the education they were offering. I hadn't done any work for GCSEs so they did basic maths and English with me, but also I did two days in college and I got my GNVQ in health and science. </p> <p>I had to leave when I was 16 and then I spent all my time in crime. It was soon after that I got caught for robbery and because I had convictions for other petty offences I was sentenced to 18 months at Huntercombe Young Offenders' Institution. </p> <p>It was the teachers in prison who got me back into education. They encouraged me to do two GCSEs. Jane, who took English, put a lot of time into making sure I did good. I felt she cared, and Stella who taught maths made us laugh so I looked forward to lessons. The person who was the biggest influence, though, was Steive Butler, the head of arts training. She let me spend a lot of time in the recording studio. I took my GCSEs after six months and got a B and a C. I felt really pleased. </p> <p>When I came out of prison I signed up to do a college course in music technology, web design and video camera work. I got my NVQ in that and was asked to teach other children on a weekend course. </p> <p>I've also got a job working for Eastern Electricity as a salesman. Life's all right now but I think with a better education there are a lot of things I could have done. So I feel sorry I failed at school, and I feel sorry that school failed me, too.\"</p>",

I went on to primary school in Muswell Hill, London, but I stayed less than a year because my mum changed jobs and couldn't collect me from school. I was sent to stay in Wolverhampton with my aunt. There, I went to a Catholic primary with a strict regime. The teachers were kind, they really showed you love. I remember one especially - he was safe, he would take me to play golf and was always there if I had a problem. Being taught by him was stimulating; I felt I could move forward and learn at my pace. I was always fairly high up in class. I only stayed at this school nine months, though, because mum wanted me back in London. So I started at a junior school in Haringey. I didn't find it easy to settle. I wanted to see my dad but he didn't take an interest in me. I became troublesome around this time. When I was nine, mum put me into foster care. She said she couldn't control me. I became disruptive at school - talking in class, mouthing back at teachers when they chastised me and playing tricks all the time. I also became the class joker making other kids laugh. Part of it was that my head was muddled with what was going on in my life, but also I was so bored in school. My mum had taught me a lot of stuff and I knew so much that we were being taught and I didn't want to sit through listening to it all again. But there was no scope for working separately from the others. I'd start to write an essay and lose interest and screw it up. Science was the one thing that really grabbed me - I wanted to be a rocket scientist and I was desperate for books to read on that. No one gave me any. My parents were from Jamaica and my mum used to give me books to read about black history - but there was nothing like that at school. It was all Columbus and stuff. I would have liked a black teacher in school teaching about black culture, - once a month, say. It would have been interesting for white kids, too. But all my schools felt like white places where there happened to be black kids who had to fit in. The school knew that I was fostered and that the placements kept breaking down, and the head was sympathetic. He would sit me down and talk to me and try to help, but I was too far gone at that time. They brought in psychiatrists and social workers but what I really wanted was my mum - I used to cry down the phone asking if I could come home to live but she said no. I don't really speak to her any more. At 11, I went to a comprehensive in Hornsey. I was happy enough for the first few months because it was a new place and a challenge to find my way in it, but then it became boring just spending all of every day in lessons where I didn't feel I was learning much. I was trouble then, I know - disruptive, loud-mouthing teachers. I was always being sent out of class - it seemed to me that more black kids than white were sent out and there was definitely a feeling in this school that black kids were the most trouble and less likely to learn. I met up with older boys who were out of class too, and already into crime. They took me under their wing and became like my family. They really cared for me. We would register at school in the morning and then bunk for the day and go down the West End stealing. Nobody at the school said anything even though I was not in class day after day. By the end of the year I had stopped going altogether. Later, I went on to White Hart Lane comprehensive but I hated that, too. I didn't feel accepted by anyone. I liked English and my English teacher used to let me write stories and give me good marks, but most of the time I just felt hated. Then one day I was going into the playground to meet my cousin who was coming to see me when I saw a teacher had him on his back and was saying \"call the police\". I pulled the teacher off and put him against a wall and told him to leave my cousin alone. I was suspended indefinitely for that and sent to a unit for excluded children. The teachers there treated you like an adult, they were on Christian-name terms and I felt I could talk to them. There were black people as well as white running it and there weren't all the petty rules and regulations like at school. I decided there I'd take the opportunity of the education they were offering. I hadn't done any work for GCSEs so they did basic maths and English with me, but also I did two days in college and I got my GNVQ in health and science. I had to leave when I was 16 and then I spent all my time in crime. It was soon after that I got caught for robbery and because I had convictions for other petty offences I was sentenced to 18 months at Huntercombe Young Offenders' Institution. It was the teachers in prison who got me back into education. They encouraged me to do two GCSEs. Jane, who took English, put a lot of time into making sure I did good. I felt she cared, and Stella who taught maths made us laugh so I looked forward to lessons. The person who was the biggest influence, though, was Steive Butler, the head of arts training. She let me spend a lot of time in the recording studio. I took my GCSEs after six months and got a B and a C. I felt really pleased. When I came out of prison I signed up to do a college course in music technology, web design and video camera work. I got my NVQ in that and was asked to teach other children on a weekend course. I've also got a job working for Eastern Electricity as a salesman. Life's all right now but I think with a better education there are a lot of things I could have done. So I feel sorry I failed at school, and I feel sorry that school failed me, too.\"",
