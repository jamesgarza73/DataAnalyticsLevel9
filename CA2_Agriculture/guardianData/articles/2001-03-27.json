      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Glenn Hoddle was giving nothing away at teatime yesterday as to when or whether he was taking the Tottenham manager's job, but there was no doubt among those connected with White Hart Lane. </p> <p>\"I think he'll take the job,\" the former Spurs player Graham Roberts declared. \"I think Glenn wants to come home.\" </p> <p>The words \"Hoddle\" and \"home\" and \"Spurs\" have become almost inseparable over the past few days, reports of his possible appointment being littered with football cliches about prodigal sons returning to spiritual homes. </p> <p>Tottenham fans have always turned weak-kneed and misty-eyed at the memory of Hoddle waltzing over the White Hart Lane turf, majestically sidestepping tackles and sweeping the ball out to the corner of the pitch with dazzling poise and grace. </p> <p>Even when he returned as manager of Chelsea and then Southampton, White Hart Lane would often echo to the sound of \"Hod is the King of White Hart Lane\" being sung to the tune of the First Noel, and for many at the Lane he is still referred to as \"Hod the god\". </p> <p>But for Tottenham fans and former players, Enic's pursuit of Hoddle as manager is seen as much more than an attempt to hire the services of a talented former player who enjoys a special relationship with the fans. Indeed, his coming is being seen as instrumental in the attempt to heal the wounds that have beset White Hart Lane over the past few years and to unite the club after a period of uncertainty and turmoil. </p> <p>The former Spurs captain Gary Mabbutt said: \"There's no doubt that Glenn Hoddle is the biggest idol Spurs have ever had and in many ways he embodied as a player everything Tottenham are about. </p> <p>\"But the fans have needed Hoddle and his memory more than ever over the last few years because of the strong Arsenal connections that became associated with the club. No matter what George [Graham] did, the fans always felt that he would be more remembered for Arsenal. </p> <p>\"Hoddle is somebody who understands the traditions of Spurs and knows what is expected of the club. It's no surprise to me that Enic have said that he is top of their list.\" </p> <p>Even during Graham's reign, which yielded one Worthington Cup triumph, most Spurs fans were still in favour of Hoddle taking over at the club. </p> <p>After the anger and divisions caused by Alan Sugar's chairmanship, his lack of spending on big-name players, the appointment of Graham and the antics of Christian Gross which almost ended in relegation, Hoddle's possible arrival is viewed as an attempt to forge a new vision at Tottenham which is shared by all those involved with the club: fans, players, directors and back-room staff. Crucially he also has a Tottenham pedigree, something Graham conspicuously lacked. </p> <p>If Enic's three- and five-year plan for Tottenham is to succeed then securing somebody such as Hoddle to orchestrate it is vital. His appointment is imperative if the psychological and football damage inflicted on the club is to be repaired. </p> <p>The Tottenham players themselves sometimes hinted at their unhappiness under Graham's reign and the impact this was having within the club. It was well known at the club, for example, that Graham and the captain Sol Campbell had not talked for several weeks and that this might have had a significant impact on the defender's contract negotiations, which are currently under way with Enic. Other important players such as Les Ferdinand and Darren Anderton, who are also out of contract this summer, rarely spoke with Graham. </p> <p>Two weeks before Graham's sacking the defender Stephen Carr captured the fans' mood when he said: \"Some people seem certain that Glenn will leave Southampton and come to Spurs at the end of the season. I can see why Spurs fans would want to believe that, as the man was an exceptional player here for many years and has since been added to the folklore of the club.\" </p> <p>Of course, Tottenham have been down the road of the return of the prodigal son once before when in 1993 Ossie Ardiles was appointed by Sugar in an attempt to placate the fans after Terry Venables left the club. </p> <p>Ardiles's reign was a disaster, albeit an entertaining one, and almost ended in relegation as his team leaked goals. </p> <p>Roberts said: \"Ossie loved to play kamikaze football but I'm sure Glenn will not be like that. He is a very cautious manager; he does not like to concede goals. He's had a lot of experience and although he made some small mistakes with England I think he's learned from them. </p> <p>\"Ossie was also a great Spurs hero but there is something special about Glenn. He's the greatest player Spurs have ever had and as a player he captured the spirit of how a Tottenham team should play. I think the biggest problem is going to be how much money Enic are going to give him to spend.\" </p> <p>Mabbutt said: \"When Ossie was given the Spurs job many fans were happy to see him back. He is also a Tottenham legend. But I think Glenn will approach the Tottenham job in a completely different way. But that all depends on whether he is going to take it. That is still the main question.\" </p> <p>Should Hoddle accept the challenge of turning Tottenham Hotspur around he is sure to be hailed as a messiah. Getting the club to the promised land, however, would be the biggest challenge he has ever faced. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "Glenn Hoddle was giving nothing away at teatime yesterday as to when or whether he was taking the Tottenham manager's job, but there was no doubt among those connected with White Hart Lane. \"I think he'll take the job,\" the former Spurs player Graham Roberts declared. \"I think Glenn wants to come home.\" The words \"Hoddle\" and \"home\" and \"Spurs\" have become almost inseparable over the past few days, reports of his possible appointment being littered with football cliches about prodigal sons returning to spiritual homes. Tottenham fans have always turned weak-kneed and misty-eyed at the memory of Hoddle waltzing over the White Hart Lane turf, majestically sidestepping tackles and sweeping the ball out to the corner of the pitch with dazzling poise and grace. Even when he returned as manager of Chelsea and then Southampton, White Hart Lane would often echo to the sound of \"Hod is the King of White Hart Lane\" being sung to the tune of the First Noel, and for many at the Lane he is still referred to as \"Hod the god\". But for Tottenham fans and former players, Enic's pursuit of Hoddle as manager is seen as much more than an attempt to hire the services of a talented former player who enjoys a special relationship with the fans. Indeed, his coming is being seen as instrumental in the attempt to heal the wounds that have beset White Hart Lane over the past few years and to unite the club after a period of uncertainty and turmoil. The former Spurs captain Gary Mabbutt said: \"There's no doubt that Glenn Hoddle is the biggest idol Spurs have ever had and in many ways he embodied as a player everything Tottenham are about. \"But the fans have needed Hoddle and his memory more than ever over the last few years because of the strong Arsenal connections that became associated with the club. No matter what George [Graham] did, the fans always felt that he would be more remembered for Arsenal. \"Hoddle is somebody who understands the traditions of Spurs and knows what is expected of the club. It's no surprise to me that Enic have said that he is top of their list.\" Even during Graham's reign, which yielded one Worthington Cup triumph, most Spurs fans were still in favour of Hoddle taking over at the club. After the anger and divisions caused by Alan Sugar's chairmanship, his lack of spending on big-name players, the appointment of Graham and the antics of Christian Gross which almost ended in relegation, Hoddle's possible arrival is viewed as an attempt to forge a new vision at Tottenham which is shared by all those involved with the club: fans, players, directors and back-room staff. Crucially he also has a Tottenham pedigree, something Graham conspicuously lacked. If Enic's three- and five-year plan for Tottenham is to succeed then securing somebody such as Hoddle to orchestrate it is vital. His appointment is imperative if the psychological and football damage inflicted on the club is to be repaired. The Tottenham players themselves sometimes hinted at their unhappiness under Graham's reign and the impact this was having within the club. It was well known at the club, for example, that Graham and the captain Sol Campbell had not talked for several weeks and that this might have had a significant impact on the defender's contract negotiations, which are currently under way with Enic. Other important players such as Les Ferdinand and Darren Anderton, who are also out of contract this summer, rarely spoke with Graham. Two weeks before Graham's sacking the defender Stephen Carr captured the fans' mood when he said: \"Some people seem certain that Glenn will leave Southampton and come to Spurs at the end of the season. I can see why Spurs fans would want to believe that, as the man was an exceptional player here for many years and has since been added to the folklore of the club.\" Of course, Tottenham have been down the road of the return of the prodigal son once before when in 1993 Ossie Ardiles was appointed by Sugar in an attempt to placate the fans after Terry Venables left the club. Ardiles's reign was a disaster, albeit an entertaining one, and almost ended in relegation as his team leaked goals. Roberts said: \"Ossie loved to play kamikaze football but I'm sure Glenn will not be like that. He is a very cautious manager; he does not like to concede goals. He's had a lot of experience and although he made some small mistakes with England I think he's learned from them. \"Ossie was also a great Spurs hero but there is something special about Glenn. He's the greatest player Spurs have ever had and as a player he captured the spirit of how a Tottenham team should play. I think the biggest problem is going to be how much money Enic are going to give him to spend.\" Mabbutt said: \"When Ossie was given the Spurs job many fans were happy to see him back. He is also a Tottenham legend. But I think Glenn will approach the Tottenham job in a completely different way. But that all depends on whether he is going to take it. That is still the main question.\" Should Hoddle accept the challenge of turning Tottenham Hotspur around he is sure to be hailed as a messiah. Getting the club to the promised land, however, would be the biggest challenge he has ever faced. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Larry Ellison, the head of software group Oracle, has not only a traditional executive jet but also a MiG fighter. He had to take the weapon systems off his purchase before the former symbol of Soviet military power was allowed into the US. </p> <p>Corporate or executive jets are being used by companies more and more frequently especially by British executives who can no longer rely on British Airways or Air France for supersonic flights following the grounding of the Concorde fleet. </p> <p>Virgin group underlined this at the weekend when it confirmed it was looking at establishing a corporate jet airline, Jetset, to cater for growing demand. </p> <p>A recent survey by the National Business Aviation Association in the US suggested that 300 of the Fortune 500 companies owned a jet and 72% of company managers are using their own jets for business travel compared with 56% two years ago. </p> <p>This might make shareholders more accepting of jets. It was not so for Robert Montague, former chief executive of trailer rental group Tiphook. He was one of the country's richest and successful executives of the 1980s with a fleet of luxury cars, a 139ft yacht and pedigree cattle. </p> <p>When the business went pear-shaped attention centred on the private jet as an example of personal excess. Similarly Australian tycoon Alan Bond went to jail after running a highly successful business empire. He owned an entire Oxfordshire village but it was his aircraft that was seen as a symbol of misplaced opulence. </p> <p><strong>The high flyers</strong><br></p> <p><strong>How much it costs</strong><br></p> <p><strong> Corporate jets, as explained away by their users</strong> </p> <p>Shell 3 planes in Europe, 2 in the US </p> <p>Glaxo SmithKline 2 \"proper jets\", 1 small turbo-prop </p> <p>BP 2 planes, both based in the US </p> <p>AstraZeneca 2 planes, both to be sold shortly </p> <p>BAe Systems 1 plane for staff use </p> <p>Scottish &amp; Newcastle 1 seven-seater plane </p> <p>Vodafone 1 \"small\" corporate aircraft</p>",

The Irish taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and other Irish politicians have been in trouble for running up travel bills of \u00a33m a year on a government Gulfstream aircraft whose destinations included race meetings. In France Elf Aquitaine - now TotalFinaElf - has been at the centre of fraud investigations over allegations that former Gaullist interior minister Charles Pasqua travelled free on the company's planes. The Pensions and Investment Research Consultants (Pirc), which specialises in corporate governance, says it sees nothing wrong with companies operating corporate jets, but it believes details of personal use by directors must always be properly included in the remuneration section of an annual report. Stuart Bell, research director at Pirc, agrees that aircraft do set alarm bells ringing but only in the context of other abuses. The internet boom has created a generation of super-wealthy businessmen who have turned to jets for business and pleasure. Larry Ellison, the head of software group Oracle, has not only a traditional executive jet but also a MiG fighter. He had to take the weapon systems off his purchase before the former symbol of Soviet military power was allowed into the US. Corporate or executive jets are being used by companies more and more frequently especially by British executives who can no longer rely on British Airways or Air France for supersonic flights following the grounding of the Concorde fleet. Virgin group underlined this at the weekend when it confirmed it was looking at establishing a corporate jet airline, Jetset, to cater for growing demand. A recent survey by the National Business Aviation Association in the US suggested that 300 of the Fortune 500 companies owned a jet and 72% of company managers are using their own jets for business travel compared with 56% two years ago. This might make shareholders more accepting of jets. It was not so for Robert Montague, former chief executive of trailer rental group Tiphook. He was one of the country's richest and successful executives of the 1980s with a fleet of luxury cars, a 139ft yacht and pedigree cattle. When the business went pear-shaped attention centred on the private jet as an example of personal excess. Similarly Australian tycoon Alan Bond went to jail after running a highly successful business empire. He owned an entire Oxfordshire village but it was his aircraft that was seen as a symbol of misplaced opulence.

This week, he is on a three-day tour of seven European cities to promote NetJet, the corporate aircraft firm which his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, bought for $725m (\u00a3500m) three years ago. </p> <p>NetJet is one of the leaders in a rapidly growing market for executive jets. In the US, most top business people, sports stars and entertainers feel they need their own transport. Aircraft are still frowned upon in corporate Britain, as the engineering company Tomkins will bear witness, but Mr Buffett reckons they will soon take off on this side of the Atlantic: \"I can't conceive of a Europe without thousands of owners 10 years from now.\" </p> <p><strong> Aunt Katie's share</strong><br> </p> <p> NetJet, which has a fleet of 338 aircraft, has snapped up 40% of all the new corporate jets built over the past four years, largely because it offers \"fractional ownership\" - a kind of timeshare deal on private aircraft. Customers buy an eighth or a 16th of a jet, entitling them to a certain number of flying hours. </p> <p>Fractional ownership appealed to Mr Buffett as soon as he encountered it. \"I literally hadn't heard of it until six or seven years ago. </p> <p>\"Now both my sisters are in it and my kids are in it - although they've got very small shares.\" </p> <p>Even Mr Buffett's 94-year-old Aunt Katie has a slice of ownership of a NetJet corporate jet. Other fans included Pete Sampras, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Martina Hingis, as well as companies such as General Electric, Gillette and Texaco. Timeshare on aircraft is becoming ever more popular as companies dispose of their own fleets because of uncertain economic conditions. </p> <p>So sure is NetJet of the potential of its proposition that it is investing $400m in 50 new mid-range Citation aircraft. With 2,400 \"owners\" on its books worldwide, Netjet had aircraft allocated to 92 countries last year. </p> <p>Mr Buffett reckons selling corporate planes is as promising in business terms as Coca-Cola. \"Production of Coke started in Atlanta in 1884 and now it is in 200 countries, with 1.1bn servings sold per day. NetJet's somewhere on that scale, between 1bn and 1.1bn a day.\" </p> <p><strong> 'Admiral's barge'</strong><br> </p> <p> There are at present about 2,000 corporate jets in operation across Europe, although companies are shy of discussing the subject, fearing that will provoke the assumption that the aircraft are used for frivolous trips. Turkey farmer Bernard Matthews' ownership of two aircraft has raised eyebrows, but the aviation industry insists that management abuse is rare. </p> <p>Graham Forbes, chief executive of the General Aviation Manufacturers and Traders Association, says: \"The concept of the admiral's barge is dead. The idea that a chief executive would have a jet for his own use is pretty much gone.\" </p> <p>He says corporate planes can actually make life tougher for employees, because companies allow them less travelling time: \"I've heard of people being expected to go to South Africa and back in one day. The companies take the view that once you get on a private aircraft, it's just another office - it's working time.\" </p> <p>One of the few British companies that is open about its aircraft ownership is BP, which says it has \"a couple\" of aircraft which it accidentally inherited when it bought the US group Amoco. </p> <p>\"With the acquisition of Amoco, we have a number of sites which are difficult to connect to each other, so we have kept a couple of their planes,\" a spokesman says. </p> <p>One of BP's aircraft was damaged last year when it skidded off a runway in Cape Cod, careered across a four-lane highway and crashed into a wall. It was carrying the group's deputy chief executive, Rodney Chase, who was shaken but unhurt. </p> <p>Brian Humphries, who runs Shell's fleet of corporate jets, says executives have to make a strong case for use of one of the oil company's aircraft. They are largely used for particularly tight schedules or for trips to places which are not accessible by commercial flights: \"Shell has had corporate aircraft since 1927. We use them a lot now for going to places in the former Soviet Union.\" </p> <p>Mr Humphries, who is also head of the European Business Aviation Association, says \"break even\" for a corporate aircraft usually occurs with four passengers on board; that number makes a private plane as cheap as business class commercial fares. </p> <p>For pop stars and sports people the advantages of a small aircraft are privacy and security. There is also personal service: Tiger Woods likes a supply of Big Macs available to him when he flies with NetJet. </p> <p>For companies, the issue is flexibility. Mr Forbes says: \"Just imagine you've got to take a sales team to a particular place. If you're travelling on a scheduled flight, you've got a limited range of destinations - you may well have to change somewhere. </p> <p>\"On a scheduled flight, a great deal of time is taken up going through terminals. If you regard your sales team as a cost, it's better for them to waste less time and get on a smaller plane.\" </p> <p><strong> Stock market indicator</strong><br> </p> <p> The aviation industry points out that in the US planes are considered no more unusual as business assets than computers and shredders. In Britain attitudes are beginning to soften. Even the government is beginning to take a different view. A report by the Department of Transport three years ago concluded that good access for business aircraft was one of the three most important factors in encouraging inward investments to a region, and airports such as Manchester and London City have been encouraged to open up to corporate customers. </p> <p>NetJet's total revenue was $1.8bn last year. The company does not disclose its profits but for Mr Buffett the company has advantages other than financial returns. The billionaire financier jokes that the company acts as a great stock market indicator: \"If any company cancels a plane and I find out about it early, I know it's a go</p>",

Fractional ownership appealed to Mr Buffett as soon as he encountered it. \"I literally hadn't heard of it until six or seven years ago. \"Now both my sisters are in it and my kids are in it - although they've got very small shares.\" Even Mr Buffett's 94-year-old Aunt Katie has a slice of ownership of a NetJet corporate jet. Other fans included Pete Sampras, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Martina Hingis, as well as companies such as General Electric, Gillette and Texaco. Timeshare on aircraft is becoming ever more popular as companies dispose of their own fleets because of uncertain economic conditions. So sure is NetJet of the potential of its proposition that it is investing $400m in 50 new mid-range Citation aircraft. With 2,400 \"owners\" on its books worldwide, Netjet had aircraft allocated to 92 countries last year. Mr Buffett reckons selling corporate planes is as promising in business terms as Coca-Cola. \"Production of Coke started in Atlanta in 1884 and now it is in 200 countries, with 1.1bn servings sold per day. NetJet's somewhere on that scale, between 1bn and 1.1bn a day.\" 'Admiral's barge' There are at present about 2,000 corporate jets in operation across Europe, although companies are shy of discussing the subject, fearing that will provoke the assumption that the aircraft are used for frivolous trips. Turkey farmer Bernard Matthews' ownership of two aircraft has raised eyebrows, but the aviation industry insists that management abuse is rare. Graham Forbes, chief executive of the General Aviation Manufacturers and Traders Association, says: \"The concept of the admiral's barge is dead. The idea that a chief executive would have a jet for his own use is pretty much gone.\" He says corporate planes can actually make life tougher for employees, because companies allow them less travelling time: \"I've heard of people being expected to go to South Africa and back in one day. The companies take the view that once you get on a private aircraft, it's just another office - it's working time.\" One of the few British companies that is open about its aircraft ownership is BP, which says it has \"a couple\" of aircraft which it accidentally inherited when it bought the US group Amoco. \"With the acquisition of Amoco, we have a number of sites which are difficult to connect to each other, so we have kept a couple of their planes,\" a spokesman says. One of BP's aircraft was damaged last year when it skidded off a runway in Cape Cod, careered across a four-lane highway and crashed into a wall. It was carrying the group's deputy chief executive, Rodney Chase, who was shaken but unhurt. Brian Humphries, who runs Shell's fleet of corporate jets, says executives have to make a strong case for use of one of the oil company's aircraft. They are largely used for particularly tight schedules or for trips to places which are not accessible by commercial flights: \"Shell has had corporate aircraft since 1927. We use them a lot now for going to places in the former Soviet Union.\" Mr Humphries, who is also head of the European Business Aviation Association, says \"break even\" for a corporate aircraft usually occurs with four passengers on board; that number makes a private plane as cheap as business class commercial fares. For pop stars and sports people the advantages of a small aircraft are privacy and security. There is also personal service: Tiger Woods likes a supply of Big Macs available to him when he flies with NetJet. For companies, the issue is flexibility. Mr Forbes says: \"Just imagine you've got to take a sales team to a particular place. If you're travelling on a scheduled flight, you've got a limited range of destinations - you may well have to change somewhere. \"On a scheduled flight, a great deal of time is taken up going through terminals. If you regard your sales team as a cost, it's better for them to waste less time and get on a smaller plane.\" Stock market indicator The aviation industry points out that in the US planes are considered no more unusual as business assets than computers and shredders. In Britain attitudes are beginning to soften. Even the government is beginning to take a different view. A report by the Department of Transport three years ago concluded that good access for business aircraft was one of the three most important factors in encouraging inward investments to a region, and airports such as Manchester and London City have been encouraged to open up to corporate customers. NetJet's total revenue was $1.8bn last year. The company does not disclose its profits but for Mr Buffett the company has advantages other than financial returns. The billionaire financier jokes that the company acts as a great stock market indicator: \"If any company cancels a plane and I find out about it early, I know it's a go",

It was an interesting programme that unearthed some rarities and found the orchestra responding as well as ever to their principal conductor Colin Davis. But it left one wishing for the impact that these forces might have generated with a really substantial symphonic work. </p> <p>The Eternal Gospel, a \"choral legend\" based on the poet Vrchlicky's retelling of the words of a medieval prophet, was a departure for Janacek. Although combining lyrical and rousing episodes with an almost primeval feel, it remains an ungainly work. The relentless orations of the prophet didn't bring out the composer's most flowing music, yet the performers did their best to convince us otherwise. The prophet's words were declaimed with committed singing by Czech tenor Vladimir Dolezal, amply supported by the London Symphony Chorus on impressive form. </p> <p>Gogol's Taras Bulba was another unlikely source of inspiration, but these gruesome tales of war, torture and filicide obviously struck a chord for Janacek, who used them as the basis for a three-movement orchestral rhapsody. Davis has a knackof finding the sharp edge of a piece of music and gently bringing it to the listener's attention; in this work he didn't have to dig too deep to find the foundations for an ominousatmosphere before stirring up a bitterly triumphal climax. </p> <p>More surprisingly, Davis also managed to draw out an edge in Dvorak's Symphonic Variations, a showcase for the composer's techniques of orchestral invention. Musical undercurrents occasionally rippled the sweet, simple surface, before the main theme came scything through the orchestra as each instrument entered the fugal finale; the jaunty, tongue-in-cheek last page sounded as though Dvorak was having fun. </p> <p>The Te Deum of 1892 found Dvorak at his most celebratory. The violins played their opening rustic melodies with vigour, preparing the way for some more strong singing from the choir. We had already heard the Slovakian soprano Andrea Dankova briefly in The Eternal Gospel; she brought a lustrous sheen to Te Deum, yet could have made a little more of her words. Fortissimo brass announced bass soloist Alastair Miles, who responded with resonant authority.

      "standfirst": "Paul Bracewell has that sinking feeling, writes  Dominic Fifield",
      "trailText": "<p>Paul Bracewell has that sinking feeling as his Halifax prepare to meet fellow Division Three bottom-dwellers Carlisle.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>From the bright lights of Fulham Road, pawing at the Premiership's coat-tails with complimentary Harrods account card in hand, to a sepulchral Shay among the league's dead men, Paul Bracewell has endured an eye-opening initiation into management. </p> <p>A year ago his Fulham side perched 10th in the First Division, a footballing phenomenon swollen by Mohamed al Fayed's money and about to explode. Tonight Bracewell and Halifax Town, 91st in the league, host Carlisle United, a place and a point above them in the Third Division. </p> <p>\"One of the local radio stations described this as a nine-pointer,\" he smiles. \"God knows what that means. Neither side's fate will be decided tonight, but it will go a long way towards it.\" Given Halifax's next three games are against promotion chasers, while they end their season at runaway leaders Chesterfield, the significance of the Cumbrians' visit is horribly plain. </p> <p>Such desperate scraps are unfamiliar to Bracewell, the 38-year-old former Everton and England midfielder who cut his coaching teeth with Peter Reid at Sunderland and Kevin Keegan at Craven Cottage. When Keegan left for England, Bracewell steered the Londoners, newly promoted to the First Division, to within sight of the play-offs. </p> <p>Most supporters were satisfied with the results; not so the chairman, who terminated the manager's contract two days shy of a year ago. </p> <p>\"Jean Tigana's done a tremendous job, but I always said it would take two years to get up. What more could I have done? Win promotion, I suppose, but I had a good relationship with Mr Al Fayed. </p> <p>\"It was a different world. I signed Lee Clark for \u00a32.75m; here I've made one permanent signing and been out most nights scouting for players.\" </p> <p>From Harrods to Halifax. Town had had a wretched start to the season, culminating in the dismissal of Mark Lillis in September, and their three-year sojourn back in the league was under threat. </p> <p>\"Most fans thought we'd never see a relegation fight again,\" says Paul Holroyd of the Halifax webzine Shaymenonline. \"We have a squad of players who should be nowhere near the bottom.\" </p> <p>After four points in four matches under the caretaker management of Tony Parks and Peter Butler, Bracewell raised eyebrows by taking up the reins of the league's bottom club and promptly lost his first five games. </p> <p>\"I wanted to have a good look at everybody,\" he says. \"Getting beaten every week didn't help and we had to stop the rot. I inherited a club with history, a club who know what it's like to play non-league, but my aim was simple from the start - to keep us up.\" </p> <p>The recovery saw six wins in 10, propelling Town into lower mid-table, only for a quartet of dire defeats this month to undermine their progress. \"We won four games on the trot at one point, but we've been up and down, using loan players and constantly changing the personnel. </p> <p>\"It's been difficult and we've lacked consistency. Even so, it's not doom and gloom. We've created a good environment, a working atmosphere for people to enjoy.\" </p> <p>On Saturday, such endeavour paid off. The Shaymen's early goal against Barnet provoked a barrage from the visitors that had the locals shivering in anticipation of another humbling defeat. Halifax took a battering but, with Craig Mawson saving a 57th-minute penalty, weathered the storm and prospered with two late goals. The win, which hoisted them off the bottom at Torquay's expense, owed much to the calming influence of the new player-coach and captain Neil Redfearn. </p> <p>The 35-year-old, who arrived from Wigan on a free transfer, is best remembered for his barnstorming displays from midfield in Barnsley's memorable, if ultimately doomed, Premiership season in 1997-98. </p> <p>\"We've got a chance of staying up, but then so have all the sides in the bottom eight,\" he says. \"If we stick to it we'll be all right. I don't think we'll struggle to score goals, but we've got to keep them out as well. The funny thing is it's an ambitious club and the future actually looks quite bright, as long as we stay up.\" </p> <p>The re-development of the Shay proves as much, although a spanking new stand would serve little purpose in the Conference.

      "bodyText": "From the bright lights of Fulham Road, pawing at the Premiership's coat-tails with complimentary Harrods account card in hand, to a sepulchral Shay among the league's dead men, Paul Bracewell has endured an eye-opening initiation into management. A year ago his Fulham side perched 10th in the First Division, a footballing phenomenon swollen by Mohamed al Fayed's money and about to explode. Tonight Bracewell and Halifax Town, 91st in the league, host Carlisle United, a place and a point above them in the Third Division. \"One of the local radio stations described this as a nine-pointer,\" he smiles. \"God knows what that means. Neither side's fate will be decided tonight, but it will go a long way towards it.\" Given Halifax's next three games are against promotion chasers, while they end their season at runaway leaders Chesterfield, the significance of the Cumbrians' visit is horribly plain. Such desperate scraps are unfamiliar to Bracewell, the 38-year-old former Everton and England midfielder who cut his coaching teeth with Peter Reid at Sunderland and Kevin Keegan at Craven Cottage. When Keegan left for England, Bracewell steered the Londoners, newly promoted to the First Division, to within sight of the play-offs. Most supporters were satisfied with the results; not so the chairman, who terminated the manager's contract two days shy of a year ago. \"Jean Tigana's done a tremendous job, but I always said it would take two years to get up. What more could I have done? Win promotion, I suppose, but I had a good relationship with Mr Al Fayed. \"It was a different world. I signed Lee Clark for \u00a32.75m; here I've made one permanent signing and been out most nights scouting for players.\" From Harrods to Halifax. Town had had a wretched start to the season, culminating in the dismissal of Mark Lillis in September, and their three-year sojourn back in the league was under threat. \"Most fans thought we'd never see a relegation fight again,\" says Paul Holroyd of the Halifax webzine Shaymenonline. \"We have a squad of players who should be nowhere near the bottom.\" After four points in four matches under the caretaker management of Tony Parks and Peter Butler, Bracewell raised eyebrows by taking up the reins of the league's bottom club and promptly lost his first five games. \"I wanted to have a good look at everybody,\" he says. \"Getting beaten every week didn't help and we had to stop the rot. I inherited a club with history, a club who know what it's like to play non-league, but my aim was simple from the start - to keep us up.\" The recovery saw six wins in 10, propelling Town into lower mid-table, only for a quartet of dire defeats this month to undermine their progress. \"We won four games on the trot at one point, but we've been up and down, using loan players and constantly changing the personnel. \"It's been difficult and we've lacked consistency. Even so, it's not doom and gloom. We've created a good environment, a working atmosphere for people to enjoy.\" On Saturday, such endeavour paid off. The Shaymen's early goal against Barnet provoked a barrage from the visitors that had the locals shivering in anticipation of another humbling defeat. Halifax took a battering but, with Craig Mawson saving a 57th-minute penalty, weathered the storm and prospered with two late goals. The win, which hoisted them off the bottom at Torquay's expense, owed much to the calming influence of the new player-coach and captain Neil Redfearn. The 35-year-old, who arrived from Wigan on a free transfer, is best remembered for his barnstorming displays from midfield in Barnsley's memorable, if ultimately doomed, Premiership season in 1997-98. \"We've got a chance of staying up, but then so have all the sides in the bottom eight,\" he says. \"If we stick to it we'll be all right. I don't think we'll struggle to score goals, but we've got to keep them out as well. The funny thing is it's an ambitious club and the future actually looks quite bright, as long as we stay up.\" The re-development of the Shay proves as much, although a spanking new stand would serve little purpose in the Conference. For the moment, the supporters are praying it does not come to that. \"If you look hard enough you can see the scratch marks on the wall revealing how many times we've been down here before,\" adds Holroyd. \"It's someone else's turn to taste failure. We've had 90 years of it and enough is enough.\" A step from the basement Defeat in tonight's Shay showdown could mean disaster for Paul Bracewell's Halifax or Ian Atkins' Carlisle.

In wide-ranging cutbacks at its internet operation, Emap is slashing its digital spend for the third time and said as many as 100 jobs could be lost from its worldwide total of around 400 Emap Digital staff. Emap announced early last year that \u00a3250m would be spent on digital projects over three years, but in November the publisher said it was halving the funds available. The latest cutback means Emap Digital's expenditure for 2001 will not exceed \u00a325m - half what it spent on new media activities in 2000. The cost of laying off staff and closing websites is expected to amount to \u00a310m. Websites for the chop include the online version of Screen International, Screendaily.co.uk; the website for advertising and film promotions magazine Shots; Motherandbaby.co.uk; and a number of outdoor websites such as anglingtimes.com, golferworld.com and salmonandtrout.com.

      "body": "<p>Illegal foreign meat meant for the Chinese restaurant industry may have contaminated pigswill and triggered the foot and mouth disease outbreak, the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, said tonight.</p> <p>Mr Brown told the Commons that he proposed to ban the use of pigswill as it seemed likely that an infected batch at a farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland, may have caused the crisis, which has now spread to 669 premises.</p> <p>He said: \"I am today proposing a ban on the use of swill feeding in this country. I have concluded that the potential risk of swill feeding, introducing disease to livestock farms where swill is not used, and to the wider community, is now greater than the benefits to the relatively small number of premises which continue to adopt this practice.\"</p> <p>Mr Brown acknowledged that the \"unprecedented outbreak\" had yet to reach its height. While he insisted the 24-hour period between diagnosis and slaughter was being rigorously pursued, he proposed further measures to tackle the spread.</p> <p>Mr Brown outlined tighter restrictions on the movement of cattle, sheep and pigs to prevent any future outbreaks reaching such a large scale. He announced two consultation documents, one on banning pigswill and the other on a standstill of cattle movement for 20 days.</p> <p>The agriculture minister added that consultations were continuing about the possibility of using vaccinations and preparation was being done, \"so that it can be done immediately if we conclude it is the right course\".</p> <p>A container of suspect meat clearly labelled for a Chinese restaurant was reportedly found hidden inside a load of household goods after confirmation of the case in Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland.</p> <p>The pig farmer at the centre of the crisis Bobby Waugh, who runs the Heddon-on-the-Wall farm said earlier today that the government was creating a \"smokescreen\" by suggesting swill could be behind the current crisis.</p> <p>Speaking from his home in Sunderland, Mr Waugh, 55, who has a current Ministry of Agriculture licence to collect and process swill, said: \"I am not responsible for this, despite suggestions of being the source, and have not even had any contact from Maff or Northumberland County Council regarding it.\"</p> <p>To qualify for the pigswill licence farmers have to own processing equipment and boil swill for four hours at 93C to kill bacteria.</p> <p>Mr Brown said 697,500 animals had been authorised for slaughter and that 423,000 had already been culled.</p> <p>As the crisis continued to escalate, the Army said it was preparing to assist in the mass slaughter of healthy animals at burial sites in Cumbria, Dumfries and Anglesey.

      "bodyText": "Illegal foreign meat meant for the Chinese restaurant industry may have contaminated pigswill and triggered the foot and mouth disease outbreak, the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, said tonight. Mr Brown told the Commons that he proposed to ban the use of pigswill as it seemed likely that an infected batch at a farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland, may have caused the crisis, which has now spread to 669 premises. He said: \"I am today proposing a ban on the use of swill feeding in this country. I have concluded that the potential risk of swill feeding, introducing disease to livestock farms where swill is not used, and to the wider community, is now greater than the benefits to the relatively small number of premises which continue to adopt this practice.\" Mr Brown acknowledged that the \"unprecedented outbreak\" had yet to reach its height. While he insisted the 24-hour period between diagnosis and slaughter was being rigorously pursued, he proposed further measures to tackle the spread. Mr Brown outlined tighter restrictions on the movement of cattle, sheep and pigs to prevent any future outbreaks reaching such a large scale. He announced two consultation documents, one on banning pigswill and the other on a standstill of cattle movement for 20 days. The agriculture minister added that consultations were continuing about the possibility of using vaccinations and preparation was being done, \"so that it can be done immediately if we conclude it is the right course\". A container of suspect meat clearly labelled for a Chinese restaurant was reportedly found hidden inside a load of household goods after confirmation of the case in Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland. The pig farmer at the centre of the crisis Bobby Waugh, who runs the Heddon-on-the-Wall farm said earlier today that the government was creating a \"smokescreen\" by suggesting swill could be behind the current crisis. Speaking from his home in Sunderland, Mr Waugh, 55, who has a current Ministry of Agriculture licence to collect and process swill, said: \"I am not responsible for this, despite suggestions of being the source, and have not even had any contact from Maff or Northumberland County Council regarding it.\" To qualify for the pigswill licence farmers have to own processing equipment and boil swill for four hours at 93C to kill bacteria. Mr Brown said 697,500 animals had been authorised for slaughter and that 423,000 had already been culled. As the crisis continued to escalate, the Army said it was preparing to assist in the mass slaughter of healthy animals at burial sites in Cumbria, Dumfries and Anglesey. Mr Brown said that 780 soldiers were now helping fight the crisis. He said: \"Their role is to assist in the disposal policies and their presence helps us free up our veterinary officers.\" Meanwhile, the Northern Ireland livestock industry was today given the green light to resume exports to Europe after being granted regional status, the Province's agriculture minister, Mrs Brid Rodgers, announced.

Given that over 1,500 delegates are registered for NUS's annual conference, that total suggests over 700 student delegates failed to vote or did not turn up.. But Ben Monks, national secretary of the NUS, a member of the Labour Students, was happy with the result: \"We beat the hard left in debate and maintained an all-important commitment to means testing, targeting resources at the poorest students. It's vitally important.\" NUS president Owain James was also pleased: \"It's the only workable strategy. If we went back to the worst of the factions, back to the hard left, and asked for \u00a38,000 per student, we'd lose the support of the public and of other unions. I think that would be unachievable.\" Mr James' opponent in this year's election for the NUS presidency, Helen Aspell rejected that argument: \"I think a full grant is a realistic aim. Plus, you've got to campaign for what's right. You shouldn't go into negotiations saying, 'this is what we'll accept', you should demand what you want and then discuss.\"",

His 9,000 questionnaire returns included some who clearly did not understand the new points system devised by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas). One physics course, for instance, proposed asking for 600 points - the equivalent of six A-levels at grade B. Another department muddled up A-levels and AS-levels. </p> <p>Yesterday a Ucas survey found that 70% of A-level students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will sit four new AS-levels this year, and 55% will be taking the new Key Skills qualifications - application of number, communications, IT, study skills, problem solving and working with others. This prompted chief executive Tony Higgins to declare: \"The days of the traditional higher education applicant with three A-levels are gone.\" He said the challenge for universities and colleges now was to \"recognise the wide variety of qualifications coming their way and to reflect this in their entry requirements.\" </p> <p>If Heap's meticulous soundings among university admissions officers are right, a lot of this wide variety will simply be ignored. Tutors will certainly take the new AS-levels into account, as they look at the present A-level modules, but many say they will not consider vocational A-levels, key skills or the new general studies paper. </p> <p>While Ucas has drawn up a table giving points scores for all qualifications, Heap feels this has not filtered through to every admissions tutor. One senior academic confided that the admissions tutors \"paled visibly\" when she explained to them what they were being asked to do. </p> <p>But even when admissions tutors are aware of the Ucas equivalences, it is clear that they do not all believe them. A vocational A-level (formerly an advanced GNVQ) in health and social care is officially equal to two A-levels - say physics and chemistry. But as Heap points out, your chances of getting into medical school with a vocational A-level in health are pretty well nil. </p> <p>The result is a split between universities that will accept the new Curriculum 2000 qualifications and those that won't - making a mockery of the government's grand reform. In general the older universities and the more sought after courses seem to be sticking to the \"old money\" until they get a better sense of the standards of the new AS-level, key skills and so on. </p> <p>Brian Heap says: \"Is it easier to get a grade B in a vocational A-level in art than a B in English A-level?

It is probably going to take two or three years before the whole system settles down.\" </p> <p>University College London is keen to encourage students to broaden their interests without being too prescriptive, explained Nigel Percival, head of the admissions office. That means three good A-level grades plus a fourth subject - either an AS-level or, for instance, a GCSE in Japanese. </p> <p>UCL would not be using the Ucas points system, which he believes is unhelpful.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A huge bureaucratic weight was lifted from the shoulders of the English academic sector last week, when the government announced plans to dramatically reduce the number of teaching inspections in universities. </p> <p>But the proposals, which will mean that 40% of university departments will avoid teaching assessments in the future, have attracted the wrath of student leaders, who argue that student applicants need all the information they can get when choosing degree courses. </p> <p>Education secretary David Blunkett told MPs last week that departments awarded good teaching scores after previous inspections should be exempt from future assessments. This would mean that the teaching of whole universities such as Cambridge, York and Warwick would avoid departmental inspections altogether, although they would still face one overall institutional audit of their activities. Under the plans a few departments would also volunteer for inspections, in order to act as benchmarks for other courses. </p> <p>Nothing boils the blood of academics more than teaching inspections, mainly because of the mountains of paperwork they require. \"It's just an enormous amount of time,\" said Andrew Oswald, professor of economics at Warwick University. \"If today's announcement actually happens, then it's very good news. It will save us a huge amount of wasteful paperwork.\" </p> <p>The move represents a political coup for university leaders, who have been furiously lobbying behind the scenes to secure ministerial backing for the so-called \"lighter touch\" for teaching inspections. The Quality Assurance Agency, which carries out the inspections, had already agreed to reduce the bureaucratic burden of visits. But academics demanded further concessions. </p> <p>Discussions between Universities UK, which represents academic leaders, and the quality watchdog chief John Randall, had ended in stalemate. But the chief executive of Universities UK, Diana Warwick, instead negotiated a deal with Sir Brian Fender, chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for England, which contracts QAA to carry out teaching inspections. At the same time UUK's president, Sir Howard Newby, bent the ears of the prime minister's education adviser Andrew Adonis. It is also understood that Cambridge and Oxford universities made direct representations to the prime minister. The teaching inspections have also been a burning topic of discussion during recent meetings of the Russell group, which brings together the heads of 20 large research universities. The Russell stand to benefit the most from the government's proposals, which would exempt any department scoring a minimum of 21 out of 24 in a previous inspection, as well as top grades in three of the six categories assessed. </p> <p>Under pressure from Number 10, and briefed by the funding council, Blunkett made his announcement in parliament last Tuesday. It is also understood that Hefce officials have already drafted documents outlining funding cuts for the QAA as it moves to a less intrusive inspection regime after this autumn. </p> <p>The move came as a revolt against the quality inspectors erupted among senior academics at the London School of Economics. The LSE board said it would \"secede from engagements with the QAA\". The funding council, however, can withdraw funds from any institution refusing to be inspected. Cambridge University also has previously delayed its own institutional audit by inspectors. </p> <p>But what has been welcomed by the producers of higher education has only raised concern among students, the customers of universities. President of the National Union of Students Owain James said: \"NUS is in favour of universities undergoing Teaching Quality Assessments because they give students clear and consistent external information on which to base their decisions when researching courses and colleges or universities. </p> <p>\"Student progression and achievement and student support and guidance are two of the six factors in the teaching and quality assessment. We are also disappointed that we have not been consulted by the DfEE in drawing up its 'lighter touch' proposals.\" </p> <p>During their inquiry into student drop-out rates, MPs were told that students often use the teaching reports to inform their applications. Higher assessment scores were associated with departments with low drop-out rates. But in its report published last week the education committee also urges the QAA to publish guidelines to help reduce the burden of paperwork for academics and assessors.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A huge bureaucratic weight was lifted from the shoulders of the English academic sector last week, when the government announced plans to dramatically reduce the number of teaching inspections in universities. But the proposals, which will mean that 40% of university departments will avoid teaching assessments in the future, have attracted the wrath of student leaders, who argue that student applicants need all the information they can get when choosing degree courses. Education secretary David Blunkett told MPs last week that departments awarded good teaching scores after previous inspections should be exempt from future assessments. This would mean that the teaching of whole universities such as Cambridge, York and Warwick would avoid departmental inspections altogether, although they would still face one overall institutional audit of their activities. Under the plans a few departments would also volunteer for inspections, in order to act as benchmarks for other courses. Nothing boils the blood of academics more than teaching inspections, mainly because of the mountains of paperwork they require. \"It's just an enormous amount of time,\" said Andrew Oswald, professor of economics at Warwick University. \"If today's announcement actually happens, then it's very good news. It will save us a huge amount of wasteful paperwork.\" The move represents a political coup for university leaders, who have been furiously lobbying behind the scenes to secure ministerial backing for the so-called \"lighter touch\" for teaching inspections. The Quality Assurance Agency, which carries out the inspections, had already agreed to reduce the bureaucratic burden of visits. But academics demanded further concessions. Discussions between Universities UK, which represents academic leaders, and the quality watchdog chief John Randall, had ended in stalemate. But the chief executive of Universities UK, Diana Warwick, instead negotiated a deal with Sir Brian Fender, chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for England, which contracts QAA to carry out teaching inspections. At the same time UUK's president, Sir Howard Newby, bent the ears of the prime minister's education adviser Andrew Adonis. It is also understood that Cambridge and Oxford universities made direct representations to the prime minister. The teaching inspections have also been a burning topic of discussion during recent meetings of the Russell group, which brings together the heads of 20 large research universities. The Russell stand to benefit the most from the government's proposals, which would exempt any department scoring a minimum of 21 out of 24 in a previous inspection, as well as top grades in three of the six categories assessed. Under pressure from Number 10, and briefed by the funding council, Blunkett made his announcement in parliament last Tuesday. It is also understood that Hefce officials have already drafted documents outlining funding cuts for the QAA as it moves to a less intrusive inspection regime after this autumn. The move came as a revolt against the quality inspectors erupted among senior academics at the London School of Economics. The LSE board said it would \"secede from engagements with the QAA\". The funding council, however, can withdraw funds from any institution refusing to be inspected. Cambridge University also has previously delayed its own institutional audit by inspectors. But what has been welcomed by the producers of higher education has only raised concern among students, the customers of universities. President of the National Union of Students Owain James said: \"NUS is in favour of universities undergoing Teaching Quality Assessments because they give students clear and consistent external information on which to base their decisions when researching courses and colleges or universities. \"Student progression and achievement and student support and guidance are two of the six factors in the teaching and quality assessment. We are also disappointed that we have not been consulted by the DfEE in drawing up its 'lighter touch' proposals.\" During their inquiry into student drop-out rates, MPs were told that students often use the teaching reports to inform their applications. Higher assessment scores were associated with departments with low drop-out rates. But in its report published last week the education committee also urges the QAA to publish guidelines to help reduce the burden of paperwork for academics and assessors.",

This week Philip Schlesinger, David Miller and William Dinan of the Stirling Media Research Institute (SMRI) publish Open Scotland?, a damning critique of political communications in Scotland, which alleges that the 1999 voter education campaign for the Scottish Parliament, which was co-ordinated by the Scottish Office in Westminster, was fatally flawed and that the main beneficiary of these errors was the Labour Party. </p> <p>Empirical research into political trends has become unfashionable these days, Miller contends. \"Many of the radicals of the 60s and 70s have drifted off into the arcane language game known as postmodernism or to other exotic theories from the left bank, in which nothing but language was real,\" says Miller. \"As a result, not only did they not do empirical research on the real world, but some of them didn't even believe that there was a real world to research. With the abandonment of concepts of truth and reality, it became rather hard for researchers to point out the latest piece of government misinformation, secrecy or manipulation.\" </p> <p>Miller is not alone in these beliefs. Rod Tiffen of the University of Sydney in Australia recently commented that it is \"amazing how many media scholars there are, and how little work on some of the most basic and important trends\". Ivor Gaber, emeritus professor of broadcast journalism at Goldsmiths College, University of London, said: \"As a former university head of department, I recall with despair my attempts to persuade colleagues to consider undertaking research projects that either the Economic and Social Research Council or the media industries might want to fund.\" </p> <p>Miller goes on to say that to many of the new breed of academics, whose desire to climb the greasy pole is matched only by their reluctance to rock the boat, the notion of independent research is anathema. It doesn't pay well, it's time-consuming and it's potentially controversial. None of which is exactly career-enhancing within the academic establishment. \"You do get whispering campaigns,\" says Miller. \"You hear that such and such a person is a trouble maker, and before long the gossip has become fact. No wonder so many academics are frightened of looking into areas where they're not wanted. Jobs are hard to come by, and the structures by which academic performance is measured are designed to favour consensus. The Research Assessment Exercise gives far greater reward to academics whose articles appear in international peer-reviewed journals, which research has shown are read by an average of between 1.5 to 6 people, than to those who are prepared to engage in a more public debate.\" </p> <p>David Miller cites Anthony Giddens, the director of the London School of Economics, as the champion par excellence of the grand theorists. \"He claims to be temperamentally unsuited to empirical research,\" says Miller, \"but the result is that he is so little of a threat that he is welcome at Downing Street.\" </p> <p>Giddens is not without his supporters, however, as some academics reject suggestions that researchers have become less critical of the government and argue that more academics should follow in Giddens' footsteps. </p> <p>\"My problem is that academics are too critical: they end up in carping mode,\" said Julian LeGrande, professor of public policy at the LSE, whose work influenced New Labour's health and welfare policies. \"There are not enough people like Giddens looking at broad policy and having a positive impact on government. The RAE encourages researchers to be increasingly specialist, focusing on in-depth narrow topics, not broad policy sweeps.\" </p> <p>Even so, three people who are almost certain to find themselves crossed off Tony and Cherie's guest list - assuming they were ever on it - are Schlesinger, Miller and Dinan, who compared the public pronouncements on the Scottish voter education campaign with what actually happened and found some disturbing discrepancies. </p> <p>The elections for the new Scottish parliament were the first in Britain to introduce an element of proportionality into the voting system, in a bid to ensure that the voices of some of the smaller parties were heard. Each elector got two votes - the first was allocated on a first-past-the-post system, and the second on a proportional basis. It was a complicated system, but Donald Dewar, the then secretary of state for Scotland, stated in October 1998 that he wanted \"to make sure that every individual understands the impact of the votes he or she casts\". </p> <p>In official documents, the rather more conservative aim of giving the voters \"sufficient\" information was put forward, but even by this lower standard the research team believes it is highly debatable whether the campaign met its aims. </p> <p>\"Six weeks after Donald Dewar made a statement pointedly giving examples where the SNP could lose out if its party's supporters cast their vote differently from the first one,\" says Miller, \"the commitment to explain their voting system disappeared from internal campaign documents.\" Scottish Office officials, Miller claims, had anticipated that Labour would be the party which would most likely suffer the most if its own supporters voted differently. All that did appear by way of voter information was a largely unintelligible fact sheet that the government's own research shows was understood by very few. </p> <p>One effect was that 112,586 Labour supporters in Glasgow alone wasted their second vote by voting Labour twice. \"Labour had its full complement of representatives through the first ballot, so voting Labour twice was a waste of a second vote,\" says Miller. \"It's possible that some voted Labour twice merely to keep another party out, but it is more likely they didn't understand the system. Research has also shown that when the system was explained to them, some respondents said they would have voted differently had they known. If only a proportion of Labour voters across areas of Scotland dominated by Labour had used their second vote differently, it is reasonable to conjecture that smaller parties like the Scottish Socialist Party and the Greens, as well as the Lib-Dems and SNP, could have gained a few extra MSPs. The ambition for proportionality was undermined. \"The evidence suggests that something odd happened in the production of the campaign. We don't know if it was incompetence or deliberate, but the final campaign did not properly explain the voting system.\" </p> <p>Not one to mince words, Miller argues that academics too often leave it to journalists to dig out political scandals; and that many of their peers have been neglecting their duties to the public in this area. \"Academic salaries are paid for out of public funding,\" Miller points out. Theoretical research may still have a large part to play in the wider political and intellectual debates, but Miller believes that not enough academics are prepared to enter the political arena at a hands-on level. </p> <p>The research team is now at the forefront of the campaign for the lobbying system in the new parliament to be regulated, and it has been critical of some journalists for offering ministers and civil servants media training. And while it may not always produce the results that the government has in mind, it still attracts kudos and respect for its independence. \"We are consulted by government and other official bodies, who regard us as a source of relevant advice,\" says Schlesinger. \"The key issue for me is that we're attempting to do some public policy research and present public interest arguments about devolution which seem not to be coming from anywhere else just now. This is a key role for academia. In my view it sets us apart from thinktanks, and because we have no-strings funding we can offer an honest view based on as exhaustive a research process as the constraints allow.\" </p> <p>LeGrande concedes the point on think tanks. \"There is some truth in the view that academics are becoming displaced by the think tanks as the architects of new ideas,\" he says. \"the think tanks dominate discussion on policy because most academics are so specialised.\" </p> <p>Miller would argue that the key issue is not specialisation so much as independence. And independence may not always bring its just rewards. Oxford is still paying for its refusal to grant Lady Thatcher an honorary degree, as millions of pounds from the Thatcher Foundation head east towards Cambridge, and many universities continue to measure their success by the research grants they can attract. Whether Stirling will welcome this latest publication is uncertain. But the Scottish electorate should be profoundly grateful. </p> <p>\u0095 Open Scotland? is published by Polygon on March 28.

      "body": "<p>Nathan Hancock is just home from college, and he's feeling good about life. He's only 15 years old, at least a year younger than his fellow students, but he's thinking about getting a job, and making something of himself. If you'd met him last year, he would have told you a very different story. </p> <p>It was 1998 when Nathan's comprehensive school said they no longer wanted him there. At first they didn't officially exclude him; they simply told him not to bother coming in any more. There had been a fight between two other boys, and somehow Nathan ended up being blamed for it although he always said he'd been in the room next door. There had been earlier incidents at the school involving Nathan, but nothing serious. </p> <p>Nathan has attention deficit disorder. Michael, his father, says what this means is that he's somewhat hyper, a bit of a fidget, but not malicious, not a bad boy. Nothing the teacher shouldn't be able to cope with. But, as with so many children who have special educational needs or emotional and behavioural difficulties, the teachers couldn't cope. A new report from the Children's Society reveals that a hugely disproportionate number of the children excluded from school have special needs. While 3% of schoolchildren are classed as having severe special needs, 40% of the 80 pupils surveyed for the report, Outside, Looking In, had such needs. A further 15% were on the code of practice, meaning some degree of special needs had been acknowledged. </p> <p>Often, pupils only get a statement of special needs after their exclusion, which means their learning difficulties have gone unrecognised at school. It can be a vicious circle. If children with learning difficulties are not being looked after, their behaviour is likely to deteriorate, and when they are excluded their learning difficulties almost invariably increase. </p> <p>Nathan was one of 10,400 young people excluded in England in 1998/99. Although figures have fallen from a 95/96 peak of 12,500, they are still almost four times what they were at the beginning of the 90s. Only 14% of those children permanently excluded were reinstated. Some 69% of exclusions were because of actual or threatened aggressive behaviour. While many of the exclusions concerned children with learning difficulties, some excluded young people were at the opposite end of the spectrum - they were so bright that school bored them and they became a nuisance. The report also shows that black pupils are about six times more likely to be excluded than white pupils - Afro-Caribbean boys are up to eight times more likely to be excluded. This disturbing statistic has been well documented previously. </p> <p>Like many excluded children, the school labelled Nathan a bully while he said that actually he was the victim of bullying - not just by his peers, but by teachers as well. \"The teachers would call me an idiot and say you need drugs because you can't control your temper.\" He was prescribed Ritalin. \"And when I did need help with my work, when I couldn't understand it, they'd just say 'Go and take some pills, Nathan'.\" </p> <p>Nathan was bigger than most of the lads at his school - at 15, he's already over 6ft. His dad says all the men in his family are big and broad. And that may be part of the problem. Nathan looks like a toughie. It's hard to believe that a boy-man like him could be bullied. But then you hear him speak and it's all too feasible. He talks in a soft Cornwall burr, and sounds so vulnerable. His dad calls him a gentle giant. </p> <p>\"It starts to get to you, and it makes you feel degraded, like you're not wanted,\" says Nathan. \"It's horrible. I got depressed sometimes and felt, what's the point in going on? I'm going to be one of those people sleeping on the streets. No school, no job, no nothing.\" You can hear the hurt, and the fear, in his voice. </p> <p>In the three years he has been away from school, Nathan has received around three hours a week of education. The school is supposed to ensure that excluded children receive 25 hours a week of education while away. On average, they get just four. \"It was nothing,\" says Michael Hancock. \"We did everything, sent letters to David Blunkett, but still there was nothing.\" </p> <p>Both Michael and Nathan feel the exclusion was unfair and could have been avoided. Chris Osborne, the Children Society's programme manager for Right To Education, couldn't agree more.\"The whole process of exclusion leaves children and parents isolated. It isn't achieving anything for anyone. We are dealing with some of the most marginalised people in society; the more they are left out the more it leads to problems for these children and society.\" </p> <p>The Children's Society has set up its Genesis project to help reduce the number of exclusions. The project works directly with schools (four, so far), and takes a long-term holistic approach because most of the problems, whether they have their roots in behaviour or learning difficulties or family background, are long-term. </p> <p>Keith Ajebo, headteacher of Deptford Green, says his school has benefited hugely from the project. His school is in an area that has seen exclusions on a shocking scale. At Oliver Goldsmiths, the primary school Damilola Taylor attended before he was murdered last year, there were a reported 150 exclusions after a new headteacher took over. By contrast, Ajebo says Deptford Green excludes one or two kids a year. \"We can pick up more of the people at the edges.\" </p> <p>Ajebo says the project has enabled him to unite the disparate agencies there to help troubled children - drugs counsellors, truancy workers etc. \"There are now six or seven professionals at the school who are not teachers, and staff can refer kids directly to them. Say if a pupil's mum had died, or they were a little wild, or they'd been chucked out of home, there is always someone here who can deal with it.\" </p> <p>Ajebo believes a head must ultimately have the power to exclude. \"When a child's presence is damaging the education of others you have to take that decision,\" he says. In 1999 it was made easier for heads to permanently exclude pupils and harder for parents to appeal against the decision. </p> <p>Yet the government insists that cutting the number of exclusions is a priority. Something doesn't quite add up. Carol Hayden, co-author of Outside, Looking In, says there are conflicting aims. On one hand the government and many parents judge a school purely on its results, on the other schools are being asked to integrate children with severe behavioural and educational difficulties. \"Schools are really valued on their ability to normalise behaviour,\" says Hayden. So when faced with children with real difficulties, it is easier to dismiss them as naughty. \"The government assumes a middle-class consen sus about measuring intelligence and rewarding achievement while wanting to be inclusive.\" </p> <p>Is that impossible? \"No, it's not impossible. But we need a wider range of opportunities on offer. Ironically, we had this in schools before the national curriculum. It used to be much more about teaching children than teaching subjects. Many teachers would say that the national curriculum is the biggest restriction in managing different types of learning.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the biggest problem is the underlying philosophy of exclusion - to punish rather than rehabilitate. \"Just look at the word exclusion. It's horrible. If you were a parent and heard your child is too awful to be with other children you'd be devastated.\" </p> <p>Michael Hancock is one of the roughly 70% of parents in the report convinced that young people with special needs are more likely to be excluded because of the pressure for results. \"Even though money is set aside for special needs, they don't want special needs in schools. It's too much hard work. If you have 100 children and 25 are special needs, and are not going to achieve anything, you've automatically got a 25% failure rate from the start. The easy way to improve results is to remove these children.\" </p> <p>The government is well aware of this. Last year it ruled that excluded pupils' results had to be included in its performance tables - to discourage schools from cynical exclusions. But the schools kicked up such a fuss that the government has reversed its decision. </p> <p>In 1999 Nathan Hancock was readmitted to his old school. Within two days he was excluded after he hit another child (he was provoked, he says). Then there was a flare-up with an ancillary worker, which led to a 15-day exclusion. Before long the head banished him for ever. </p> <p>Michael Hancock says it was virtually impossible for his son to be reintegrated into the school. First, there was so much hostility towards him and, second, he was always aware that he wasn't wanted. Hancock feels he is partly to blame for the exclusion. \"Our ignorance of the system allowed us to be pushed around. It took me four years to get hold of his school records, and they're still reported inaccurately. I also discovered he was supposed to have anger management from the school and never received it.\" </p> <p>Nathan is still bewildered about his exclusion. \"I didn't do anything excludable,\" he says categorically. \"I really did want to be there. All my friends were there. It was quite fun, and sometimes I was learning stuff. They didn't want me there, so they just ditched me.\" </p> <p>It was only when his father began to exercise his rights that the council came up with a solution for Nathan. They have provided the cash for him to attend college three days a week. Here he is learning about building and computers, and he loves it. He says he's treated with respect and feels transformed by the experience. \"They say if you fail once don't worry, try again. You can't go wrong with that, can you? I've got a lot of confidence in myself. I'm definitely going to get a job now.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Outside, Looking In: Children's and Families' Experience of School Exclusion by Carol Hayden and Simon Dunne is published by the Children's Society, price \u00a314.95 (plus \u00a31.50 p&amp;p). </p> <p>Write to: Edward Rudolf House, Margery Street, London WC1X OJL.

The first is a notice of our next (extraordinary) governors' meeting whose business is strictly limited to the election of a chair and vice-chair. </p> <p>The second is notice that I, personally, am in arrears with dinner money for Lucy (by \u00a327.40). Oops. This is somewhat embarrassing, since it was only at the last meeting that a new strategy for tackling dinner money arrears was a major item for discussion. I must be one of the first parents to receive the new-style letter reminding us that the school office can provide free school dinner forms if required, but also warning that the dinner service will be swiftly withdrawn if the debt is not cancelled within three school days. Oh well, I think. At least it shows the school is using the new doctrine of tough love. </p> <p>We're always meaning to start making packed lunches for Lucy. They would be more nourishing than the high-carb diet of chips and beans plus pudding. </p> <p>One of the governors, Marcia Jameson, is a dinner lady. When the subject of school dinners arose at one meeting, she observed that the kitchen always provides vegetables, but that none of the kids ever accepts a portion by choice.

The first is a notice of our next (extraordinary) governors' meeting whose business is strictly limited to the election of a chair and vice-chair. The second is notice that I, personally, am in arrears with dinner money for Lucy (by \u00a327.40). Oops. This is somewhat embarrassing, since it was only at the last meeting that a new strategy for tackling dinner money arrears was a major item for discussion. I must be one of the first parents to receive the new-style letter reminding us that the school office can provide free school dinner forms if required, but also warning that the dinner service will be swiftly withdrawn if the debt is not cancelled within three school days. Oh well, I think. At least it shows the school is using the new doctrine of tough love. We're always meaning to start making packed lunches for Lucy. They would be more nourishing than the high-carb diet of chips and beans plus pudding. One of the governors, Marcia Jameson, is a dinner lady. When the subject of school dinners arose at one meeting, she observed that the kitchen always provides vegetables, but that none of the kids ever accepts a portion by choice. Then I remember that I survived, it seemed, my entire school career chiefly by eating double portions of dessert - rather than the spam fritters deep-fried in what tasted like motor oil. The last time school dinners was discussed at a governors' meeting a month or so ago, the head, Mr Richardson, said that he was considering raising the daily fee from \u00a31.20 to \u00a31.50 in order to finance a revolution in food quality.

And that's just the staff at the fictional urban Summerdown Comprehensive in Channel 4's new midweek drama series, Teachers. TV companies like a winning formula, and ever since This Life captured millions of viewers with its edgy, well written soap of twentysomething lawyers, there has been a rash of look-a-likes. Teachers is the latest offering, even down to casting Andrew Lincoln, Egg in This Life, in the leading role of Simon. From the opening, jerkily filmed, sequences of a bunch of good-looking men and women arsing around and getting pissed, the viewer knows exactly what is in store. </p> <p>Another bunch of twenty and thirtysomethings are sitting around the TV in a south London living room. They are also teachers, but unlike the ones on the TV, these are the real McCoy. They are all either currently working in London secondary schools, or have had recent experience of teaching, and are here to watch the first two episodes of the Channel 4 series. After an hour or so of animated conversation, the room goes quiet. At first, I mistake the silence for focused concentration and it's only after a few minutes that I realise two of the teachers have dozed off. </p> <p>Here's the first point of departure from reality. While the Summerdown teachers seem to think nothing of going out and getting trashed every night of the week, our real ones are in a state of semi-permanent knackeredness. \"They don't appear to spend any time marking or preparing their lessons,\" says Paul Jenkins, a music teacher. \"Where's all the paperwork and the endless meetings,\" adds Cherry Tolcher. </p> <p>Midway through the first episode, everyone begins to lose count of the factual inaccuracies. Health and safety issues are ignored, a male teacher spends time alone with a girl pupil, smokes dope with another pupil and generally pays no attention to the national curriculum. Even the staff room scenes come in for criticism. \"The gossip is generally much less animated and far more trivial,\" smiles Elena Mauro, \"such as who hasn't washed up the coffee mugs. There weren't enough weirdos in the staff room.\" </p> <p>But it's not the litany of on-screen errors that the teachers find most depressing. It is the dull stereotypes that really rile them. \"It's cliche after cliche,\" says Jenkins. \"The two main pupils are the fat boy who wants to learn and the tarty teenaged girl,\" sighs Katherine Hodgkinson. Tolcher points out that the two main teachers are the diametrically opposed groovy young man whom everyone adores and the rather straight-laced serious woman, who is a total bore. It's script-writing by numbers. </p> <p>The shadow of Dead Poets' Society hangs less heavily over Teachers than many classroom dramas. There is the implication that it is the supposedly charismatic Simon who will turn out to be the \"teacher who makes a difference\" as he wanders around the classroom declaiming grandly, but this is steadily undermined - either accidentally or deliberately - by his persistent rubbishing of the only boy in his class with any academic interest. </p> <p>Paul Jenkins has some sympathy with the Simon character. \"When I first qualified I didn't work that hard, and it took me a little time to find my feet,\" he says. \"But I was nowhere near as lazy, nor did I party that hard.\" Hodgkinson says that most newly qualified teachers are incredibly hard-working these days. \"Teacher training isn't a doddle, so most new teachers know exactly what is expected of them from the off.\" </p> <p>No one would argue that a TV drama should be a recruitment video for the Department of Education, but all the teachers raised serious concerns about how their profession would be perceived by the public. Mike Kinsman believes people have very ambivalent feelings about teachers. \"When I tell someone what I do, the first reaction is often, 'What a marvellous job you do, I couldn't possibly do that',\" he says. \"But it's almost always followed up by a general statement to the effect that 'most teachers need to buck their ideas up a bit'. When I first saw the billboard poster '30 Kids and a Hangover' for the programme, my heart sank. I thought, 'Here we go. Undermined again'.\" </p> <p>Cherry Tolcher wonders what the effect on parents might be. \"If any parent, whose child had just been offered a place at secondary school, happened to see this and thought this was the way the teaching staff behaved, they might seriously consider taking him or her out of school.\" </p> <p>Lord Puttnam knows more than most about the dangers of portraying teachers on screen. \"At the last NASUWT conference I showed a variety of clips from my own films, such as SWALK, P'tang Yang Kipperbang and War of the Buttons,\" he says. \"It was my apologia as I realised that I had been as guilty as anyone of portraying stereotypes. There are many spectacular teachers doing spectacular work, but they are rarely mentioned. Teaching dramas have yet to reach the level of complexity of many hospital TV programmes, such as Casualty.\" </p> <p>Teachers is no exception, with a leaden script and Andrew Lincoln, who played a thoroughly unsympathetic jerk in This Life, simply repeating his performance. But perhaps there is one convergence between drama and real life. If all the fictional teachers were forced to sit down and watch the first two episodes of Teachers back to back, maybe they would nod off, too. </p> <p>\u0095 The second episode of Teachers is on Wednesday, Channel 4, 10pm.</p> <p><strong>Please Sir, no more</strong> </p> <p><strong> Goodbye, Mr Chips, 1939/1969</strong> </p> <p>Misty-eyed slush in which shy schoolmaster meets music hall star, gets married and has 283 children. </p> <p><strong> The teacher's verdict:</strong> \"Museum piece.

      "body": "<p>At Southwark cathedral, on the south bank of the Thames, the education secretary, David Blunkett, will tomorrow be aiming to pour oil on troubled water. </p> <p>The one-time further education lecturer is hoping to announce a package which will avert the threatened May strike by Natfhe, the lecturers' union. </p> <p>Blunkett will also be announcing more cash for the learning and skills system which wobbles to its feet next week. In the litany of largesse preceding the election, tomorrow is further education's day. </p> <p>But the strike threat is his most pressing concern. Even though any industrial action is not now likely to start until after May 3, a probable general election date, ministers are nonetheless anxious to settle the claim. </p> <p>According to Natfhe, that is going to take a considerable sum of money - more than the amounts being whispered. And the union stands firm in its insistence that it will not accept performance-related pay. </p> <p>Natfe's interim claim for next year is for a \u00a33,000 flat-rate pay rise for managers and lecturers. This is the first step in a staged award the union wants to be effected over the next four years to restore lecturers' pay-relativity with salaries in schools.

      "bodyText": "At Southwark cathedral, on the south bank of the Thames, the education secretary, David Blunkett, will tomorrow be aiming to pour oil on troubled water. The one-time further education lecturer is hoping to announce a package which will avert the threatened May strike by Natfhe, the lecturers' union. Blunkett will also be announcing more cash for the learning and skills system which wobbles to its feet next week. In the litany of largesse preceding the election, tomorrow is further education's day. But the strike threat is his most pressing concern. Even though any industrial action is not now likely to start until after May 3, a probable general election date, ministers are nonetheless anxious to settle the claim. According to Natfhe, that is going to take a considerable sum of money - more than the amounts being whispered. And the union stands firm in its insistence that it will not accept performance-related pay. Natfe's interim claim for next year is for a \u00a33,000 flat-rate pay rise for managers and lecturers. This is the first step in a staged award the union wants to be effected over the next four years to restore lecturers' pay-relativity with salaries in schools. Lecturers' pay has fallen by 10%-35% behind that of teachers. Everybody apparently sees the strength of the lecturers' case. Natfhe's claim that few, if any, other workforces in the public sector have delivered the equivalent of a 70% growth in student numbers while seeing their pay levels fall steadily behind. It has been common for lecturers in some colleges to go for a couple of years without pay increases. At the start of this month, a survey by the Association of Colleges showed that nearly a fifth of colleges had not paid this year's 3.3% pay settlement. Lecturers' exasperation was further inflamed when they realised that schoolteachers would get a sum equivalent to 8% of their salary bill to implement a pay initiative, whereas the sum announced for them - \u00a350m - represented 2% of their total bill. In recognition of this inequity, the AoC last month told ministers they needed to find an extra \u00a3200m to restore parity on top of the \u00a3150m which Malcolm Wicks, the lifelong learning minister, announced would be available over the next two years. And so, the education secretary will, according to reports, announce \u00a3200m for year three tomorrow. His package is also expected to include a scheme for providing lecturers with free laptop computers and a range of \"golden hello\" payments to entice people to teach shortage subjects. The rest of Blunkett's pay announcement may well follow proposals drawn up by the AoC in February, after consultation with the DfEE and Natfhe. If so, the total will be a package which the AoC, at least, thinks should be acceptable. It won't claw back that 10% pay gap with teachers, but that, according to AoC sources, is an unrealistic expectation in three years. But will \u00a3200m in the third year do the trick for Natfhe? The clear message from the union leadership is that it won't.",

      "body": "<p>Social workers will have to gain a three-year vocational degree to qualify as part of a drive to raise standards, the government announced today. </p> <p>Speaking at a Guardian/National Institute of Social Work (NISW) conference, health minister John Hutton said: \"Possibly one of the most urgent priorities we face is the need for a better trained workforce.\" </p> <p>The minister added: \"The new qualification will give greater emphasis to field experience and the practical application to skills and knowledge and with a stronger focus on children.\" He called it a \"once in a generation opportunity to make sure the training equips the profession fully for its future role and tasks\". </p> <p>Last summer the government released a consultant's report calling for a degree level qualification to replace the current two-year diploma in social work. Consultation over the government's quality strategy overwhelmingly backed this proposal. </p> <p>The new curriculum, to be launched in 2003, will focus on practice and will be partly based on national occupational standards that define what employers require social workers to be able to do when they join the workforce. </p> <p>\"We want social workers with skills in analysis and assessment who can confidently apply knowledge to practice - social workers who create opportunities for users and who work collaboratively with other professionals,\" said Mr Hutton. </p> <p>Social workers would also need to demonstrate that they were to continue to refresh their knowledge and skills once in employment, he said. Social workers had to promote independence and opportunity and work with users and their families as part of an \"active\" welfare state. Neither the free market nor a paternalistic corporate state was acceptable.</p> <p>Social work experts welcomed the announcement, as the profession has long been calling for a degree-level qualification. Arthur Keefe, chairman of the national social services training organisation (TOPSS), said: \"Social work has become much more complicated. Social workers need to make high level judgments and are required to integrate research into their practice. It's about time and level, about broad curriculum and a personal and professional development that will allow them to do the job.\" A two-year diploma was insufficient in terms of time and academic level, he said. </p> <p>TOPSS was concerned that there was no bursary scheme to support undergraduate students. However, Mr Keefe welcomed the minister's promise to keep student finance under review.</p> <p>Daphne Statham, NISW director, said: \"As the modernisation agenda takes effect, the job becomes increasingly high risk. There is no way that two years is enough. Nurses and teachers get more time to train. Social work needs no less.\" </p> <p>Mr Hutton emphasised that the government was not proposing a takeover of social services by the NHS. \"We are not pursuing the so-called medical model over the social care model,\" he said. \"The new ways of integrating NHS and social care services should be built upon a genuine partnership between equals, with each making its own distinctive contribution to what should be a single local care network.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Social workers will have to gain a three-year vocational degree to qualify as part of a drive to raise standards, the government announced today. Speaking at a Guardian/National Institute of Social Work (NISW) conference, health minister John Hutton said: \"Possibly one of the most urgent priorities we face is the need for a better trained workforce.\" The minister added: \"The new qualification will give greater emphasis to field experience and the practical application to skills and knowledge and with a stronger focus on children.\" He called it a \"once in a generation opportunity to make sure the training equips the profession fully for its future role and tasks\". Last summer the government released a consultant's report calling for a degree level qualification to replace the current two-year diploma in social work. Consultation over the government's quality strategy overwhelmingly backed this proposal. The new curriculum, to be launched in 2003, will focus on practice and will be partly based on national occupational standards that define what employers require social workers to be able to do when they join the workforce. \"We want social workers with skills in analysis and assessment who can confidently apply knowledge to practice - social workers who create opportunities for users and who work collaboratively with other professionals,\" said Mr Hutton. Social workers would also need to demonstrate that they were to continue to refresh their knowledge and skills once in employment, he said. Social workers had to promote independence and opportunity and work with users and their families as part of an \"active\" welfare state. Neither the free market nor a paternalistic corporate state was acceptable. Social work experts welcomed the announcement, as the profession has long been calling for a degree-level qualification. Arthur Keefe, chairman of the national social services training organisation (TOPSS), said: \"Social work has become much more complicated. Social workers need to make high level judgments and are required to integrate research into their practice. It's about time and level, about broad curriculum and a personal and professional development that will allow them to do the job.\" A two-year diploma was insufficient in terms of time and academic level, he said. TOPSS was concerned that there was no bursary scheme to support undergraduate students. However, Mr Keefe welcomed the minister's promise to keep student finance under review. Daphne Statham, NISW director, said: \"As the modernisation agenda takes effect, the job becomes increasingly high risk. There is no way that two years is enough. Nurses and teachers get more time to train. Social work needs no less.\" Mr Hutton emphasised that the government was not proposing a takeover of social services by the NHS. \"We are not pursuing the so-called medical model over the social care model,\" he said. \"The new ways of integrating NHS and social care services should be built upon a genuine partnership between equals, with each making its own distinctive contribution to what should be a single local care network.\"",

Mr Cook told the Commons that Britain's commitment to a new battle group within K-For of 400 troops to help secure the Kosovo/Macedonia border had been \"well received\". The redeployed British troops in Kosovo will attempt to stop the infiltration of ethnic Albanian gunmen. Mr Cook said he had told Macedonian president Boris Trajkovski of the importance of keeping the operation \"proportionate to the threat\" and to restrain from action that could cause civilian casualties. \"I am pleased to report that on information currently available to us, there have been no civilian deaths,\" Mr Cook said. Updating MPs on the current situation in the region in an emergency statement, Mr Cook said: \"On Sunday the army in Macedonia launched an operation to retake the hills above Tetovo. \"The operation appears to have been a success and the armed extremists have abandoned their positions.\" Mr Cook said he had spoken to Javier Solana, the European Union's security affairs chief, in the Macedonia capital of Skopje. \"We both agreed the important priority now for the government of Macedonia is to follow up the military action by taking a political initiative to meet the legitimate aspirations of the Albanian minority,\" he said. \"In the meantime, Britain will continue to take every practical measure to improve the situation on the ground.\" Mr Cook said: \"Over the past two years we have turned the tide against the nationalists who took to violence in pursuit of a greater Serbia or a greater Croatia. \"We must now be equally firm against extremists who are using terror in pursuit of a greater Albania. \"The period in which borders in the Balkans were redrawn in blood is over and will not be allowed to return,\" he added.

      "bodyText": "William Hague will not be able to get his latest party political broadcast on TV if it can in any way be deemed racist. The BBC and regulators for commercial stations operate strict rules banning anything likely to stir racial hatred. Last night it emerged that the Conservatives plan to play the race card during the election. Documents leaked to the Guardian's politics website show agents for the Tories are trying to recruit actors who look like eastern Europeans to star in their TV broadcast. The Independent Television Commission today confirmed that broadcasters are responsible for ensuring the PPBs they transmit do not contravene its programme codes. A controversial new party broadcast being put together in secret by the Conservatives will show a group of eastern European asylum seekers trying to enter Britain from France. This could go against the watchdog's codes, which state that \"no programme should be transmitted which is intended to stir up racial hatred or, taking into account the circumstances, is likely to do so\". The ITC also stipulates that stereotyped portrayal of racial minorities should be avoided. \"The parties are responsible for the content of PPBs although the broadcasters have an obligation to observe the law,\" said a BBC spokesman. \"That would clearly include avoiding incitement to racial hatred. The political party would also have to comply with the broadcaster's own taste and decency guidelines.\" The Commission for Racial Equality, which earlier this month persuaded the leaders of all the major parties to sign a pledge not to use the race card during the election, said it was not responsible for policing PPBs. \"At the end of the day it's down to the electorate to make up its mind how it feels about this kind of thing,\" said a CRE spokeswoman.

The explosions came six hours apart, the first detonated by remote control near a shopping mall and the second by a man with explosives strapped to his body who blew himself up next a bus. Yesterday Palestinian snipers killed a 10-month-old girl in Hebron. The attacks coincided with the start of the Arab League summit in Jordan, where the issue of Palestine is expected to be a key focus, and placed growing pressure on the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, to retaliate. Mr Sharon was elected last month on a promise to restore security to Israelis, but the government has been reluctant to respond during the summit. \"We have a war here,\" said Jerusalem's mayor, Ehud Olmert, adding that the government had expected an escalation of violence during the Arab summit. A spokesman for Mr Sharon, speaking before the second bombing, said that Israel would retaliate, but refused to say what steps the government would take. \"I can assure them [the Palestinians] that the response ... will be swift and will be coming,\" he said. Commenting from the summit in Amman late yesterday, the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, made no reference to the killing of the Israeli girl, only denouncing Israel's immediate response - the shelling of the Hebron neighbourhood of Abu Sneineh, from which the shots on the Jewish enclave had been fired. Seven Palestinians were hurt in the shelling. Today's explosion close to the bus went off shortly after 1pm local time (11am GMT) in French Hill, a Jewish neighbourhood in a disputed part of northern Jerusalem. Flames shot up the right-hand side of the bus and its back windows were blown out.

And yet ... the parties know people are turned off politics, especially the young least-likely-to-vote voters, the very people most likely to surf the net for information, preferably informal and - that elusive formula - serious and humorous. That is what Guardian Unlimited's politics site will seek to do. It would be good to help surprise the experts and boost turnout in 2001 - instead of see it drop below 70% (it was 71.5% last time) as widely predicted. In the US in 2000 18% of voters went online for election news and both John McCain and Bill Bradley's insurgencies were part-funded off the net. Like last autumn's fuel protesters, the May Day anarchists and, globally, the Seattle-Prague protests against world free trade, there is scope for insurgents, for instant, in-depth publication of complex documents, not to mention the kind of probing journalism that Matt Drudge's website (the Drudge report) pioneered in the US. In short, new media is likely to be a mixed blessing for established parties (and old media). But whether at this election or the next, there is no putting the e-genie back in his cyber-bottle.

The attempt to discover why so few young people are involved in politics will be addressed by home office minister Paul Boateng, singer Billy Bragg, comedian Mark Thomas and TV presenter Tony Robinson. The move comes after an exclusive poll for Guardian Unlimited, revealing that more than two-thirds of young people were unable to even name their own MP. However, the internet was of more interest to 18-24 year olds, nearly a quarter of whom said they would be surfing the web for political information during the general election campaign. Now a delegation of French students and the French minister for urban affairs, Claude Bartolone, are en route to London to share the experiences of France in tackling juvenile apathy. They will be joined by more than 200 UK young people, plus representatives from Voluntary Service Overseas and anti-violence organisations. The French contingent operate the Jean Jaures thinktank in Paris which studies political turn-off among the nation's young.

Andrew Harrison, marketing director of Nestle UK, said TV costs are twice what they were a decade ago. \"We can't cope with TV cost inflation that is out of all proportion to commercial reality - we'll walk away unless we can realign,\" said Mr Harrison, speaking to an audience of TV executives at the TV 2001 conference in Madrid. He outlined the steep drop in Nestle's use of TV advertising: TV accounted for all of the company's marketing budget 10 years ago, 80% five years ago, 67% last year and 65% this year. Within three years, TV will account for \"much less than two-thirds\" of the marketing budget. Nestle UK spends \u00a370m on the televised promotion of brands such as Nescafe, KitKat, Shredded Wheat and Perrier. Mr Harrison said the TV industry was under threat from an explosion of rival media, the importance of which overshadowed arguments about digital TV and industry regulation. \"I would urge us all to stop focusing on protectionism and regulators and, instead, focus on the delivery of integrated cross-media plans,\" said Mr Harrison. He called for the TV industry to revolutionise the way it sells advertising, saying brand owners increasingly want to buy a share of total media rather than a share of TV media. KitKat was held up as an example of the direction in which Nestle is moving. Until a couple of years ago, the brand was promoted solely through TV and posters. Now it uses TV, radio, press, outdoor, sponsorship and new media, including text message games. Mr Harrison said Nestle has linked up with Emap to promote Smarties through Smash Hits.

      "body": "<p>They call it the Market Square merry-go-round. From Thursday until Sunday night thousands of revellers pour into Nottingham's historic centre and crawl from pub to bar to club.</p> <p>Those turned away because they are not old enough might visit an off-licence that is prepared to turn a blind eye or persuade an older friend to buy them a bottle, then find a dark corner in which to drink it.</p> <p>By the time the Market Square clock begins to strike the early hours, most are staggering home or consummating new relationships in doorways. Others are getting into trouble: fighting or smashing windows or hatching drink-fuelled plans to do mischief.</p> <p>Of course, such behaviour has gone on across the country since the days of Robin Hood, but clever, aggressive marketing by powerful companies may be encouraging youngsters to drink - and get drunk - from a much earlier age. On offer are colourful, potent drinks with fruity flavours that disguise the taste of alcohol. Many are staggeringly cheap. Some are supplied in a new generation of brightly lit bars often providing live sport or music.</p> <p><b> Marketing</b><br></p> <p>Others that researchers believe are intended to tempt even younger drinkers are marketed through local shops and off-licences. Most are designed to be swigged from the bottle, making them easier to carry around - and hide if necessary.</p> <p>A study released to coincide with a World Health Organisation conference in Sweden last month must have made sobering reading for parents. Three in 10 Britons aged 14 to 16 said they had been drunk at least 20 times. Nearly one in 10 said their families did not know where they were on a Saturday night.</p> <p>Many researchers believe initiation to drink begins around the age of 11 but can come as early as eight. The average amount of alcohol consumed by 11- to 15-year-olds in 1990 was 0.8 units a week, according to the Office of National Statistics. By 1998 it was 1.6 units. About 1,000 children aged under 15 are admitted to hospital every year with alcohol poisoning.</p> <p>Why are young people drinking more and earlier? Strathclyde University researchers, in a study published in the magazine Addiction, examined in detail how drinks are marketed. They found that in Britain consumers, especially young people, appeared more willing to experiment than their counterparts in other countries. This was encouraging global producers to use British drinkers as guinea pigs.</p> <p>The study traced back drinking preferences among the young to the late 1980s, when strong, clear ciders and fortified wines with exciting names and bright packaging came on the market. The mid-1990s were the heydey of these alcopops, and by 1998 Britain's market in so-called flavoured alcoholic beverages was estimated at \u00a3750m. Today a new range of products includes pre-mixed cocktails and strong bottled beers. They share bright labelling and often outlandish names that appeal to the young. Quite how young remains a matter for debate.</p> <p>The Strathclyde team suggests that products such as Bacardi Breezers appeal to \"established drinkers\" - the 16- to 24-year-olds. But they believe that another range of stronger drinks is designed to attract \"starter drinkers\" aged 11 to 15.</p> <p>One product examined was MD 20/20, or \"Mad Dog\", a fortified wine with an alcohol concentration of 13.1% imported from America which comes in a range of fruit flavours. The drinks come in clear bottles which show off their bright contents. They have a screw top, so are easy to carry around.</p> <p>The researchers claim that Mad Dog meets the \"needs and taste preferences of experimental drinkers\". The taste of alcohol is disguised by the fruity flavours. The high alcohol content satisfies the need for \"rapid intoxication\".

      "bodyText": "They call it the Market Square merry-go-round. From Thursday until Sunday night thousands of revellers pour into Nottingham's historic centre and crawl from pub to bar to club. Those turned away because they are not old enough might visit an off-licence that is prepared to turn a blind eye or persuade an older friend to buy them a bottle, then find a dark corner in which to drink it. By the time the Market Square clock begins to strike the early hours, most are staggering home or consummating new relationships in doorways. Others are getting into trouble: fighting or smashing windows or hatching drink-fuelled plans to do mischief. Of course, such behaviour has gone on across the country since the days of Robin Hood, but clever, aggressive marketing by powerful companies may be encouraging youngsters to drink - and get drunk - from a much earlier age. On offer are colourful, potent drinks with fruity flavours that disguise the taste of alcohol. Many are staggeringly cheap. Some are supplied in a new generation of brightly lit bars often providing live sport or music. Marketing Others that researchers believe are intended to tempt even younger drinkers are marketed through local shops and off-licences. Most are designed to be swigged from the bottle, making them easier to carry around - and hide if necessary. A study released to coincide with a World Health Organisation conference in Sweden last month must have made sobering reading for parents. Three in 10 Britons aged 14 to 16 said they had been drunk at least 20 times. Nearly one in 10 said their families did not know where they were on a Saturday night. Many researchers believe initiation to drink begins around the age of 11 but can come as early as eight. The average amount of alcohol consumed by 11- to 15-year-olds in 1990 was 0.8 units a week, according to the Office of National Statistics. By 1998 it was 1.6 units. About 1,000 children aged under 15 are admitted to hospital every year with alcohol poisoning. Why are young people drinking more and earlier? Strathclyde University researchers, in a study published in the magazine Addiction, examined in detail how drinks are marketed. They found that in Britain consumers, especially young people, appeared more willing to experiment than their counterparts in other countries. This was encouraging global producers to use British drinkers as guinea pigs. The study traced back drinking preferences among the young to the late 1980s, when strong, clear ciders and fortified wines with exciting names and bright packaging came on the market. The mid-1990s were the heydey of these alcopops, and by 1998 Britain's market in so-called flavoured alcoholic beverages was estimated at \u00a3750m. Today a new range of products includes pre-mixed cocktails and strong bottled beers. They share bright labelling and often outlandish names that appeal to the young. Quite how young remains a matter for debate. The Strathclyde team suggests that products such as Bacardi Breezers appeal to \"established drinkers\" - the 16- to 24-year-olds. But they believe that another range of stronger drinks is designed to attract \"starter drinkers\" aged 11 to 15. One product examined was MD 20/20, or \"Mad Dog\", a fortified wine with an alcohol concentration of 13.1% imported from America which comes in a range of fruit flavours. The drinks come in clear bottles which show off their bright contents. They have a screw top, so are easy to carry around. The researchers claim that Mad Dog meets the \"needs and taste preferences of experimental drinkers\". The taste of alcohol is disguised by the fruity flavours. The high alcohol content satisfies the need for \"rapid intoxication\". They also claim that the drink tends to be sold through smaller outlets which are less easy to regulate and less likely to enforce age limits. The Drinks Company, which imports MD 20/20, refused to say how many bottles it sold. Its joint managing director, Mike Gilmer, said there was no research on who drank the product but most drinkers would be over 25. It was \"nonsense\" to suggest it was aimed at children. The Portman Group, which was set up by Britain's leading drinks manufacturers and has a panel to examine naming, packaging and merchandising issues, has upheld complaints about some products which it thinks are trying to appeal to a younger crowd. But critics argue that the sanctions it can take are limited, and they are uneasy that the group was set up by manufacturers. The Strathclyde researchers believe that manufacturers \"no longer think of themselves as in the alcohol business but in the mood-altering substance business\". In recent years the Portman Group's panel has upheld complaints against a beer called Cannabis and a lager called Greenleaf Hemp. That importers and manufacturers even thought about trying to get such products into bars and off-licences seems to back up the point. The trend is particularly worrying because often young people with addiction problems take drugs and drink alcohol. Back in the centre of Nottingham, the tactics that bars and pubs use to draw youngsters in are obvious. Almost every venue has special offers, happy hours, theme nights. Libertys, for example, encourages drinkers to its \"Frisky\" Friday night. Admission is free and patrons can drink until 1am. Metz, a schnapps-based drink, is on offer at two for the price of one. At Weatherspoons pub on the square, its \"Famous Five\" of beers and ready-mixed cocktails are \u00a31 each \"all day, every day\".

      "bodyText": "Billboard advertiser Maiden Group has admitted that uncertainty over the date of the general election is holding back business. Ron Zeghibe, chief executive of Maiden, said companies were withholding their summer bookings because the foot and mouth crisis might push the election back to June. A confident start to the year for the group has seen billboards booked up to 12 weeks in advance, but that figure has fallen to between six and eight weeks as companies wait for prime minister Tony Blair to make up his mind. Advertisers shy away from booking advertising space during elections, and they are waiting to see if the Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties clog up the hoardings for May and June. \"Due to election issues, the months of May and June are not filling in yet. If this uncertainty were to take hold,then clearly there could be a short-term knock-on effect,\" said Mr Zeghibe. Mr Zeghibe added, however, that the group's strong first quarter sales, up 22% on the same period last year, would guarantee a positive beginning to 2001. \"We have built up such a lead over the past four months that we have a cushion for the first half of the year,\" he said. Mr Zeghibe would not reveal exact details of Labour and Conservative party spending on hoarding, but said political bookings for next month are \"not even close\" to the levels of April 1997, when the last election was called. The main political parties stand to lose millions of pounds if they cancel their bookings at the last moment, incurring a penalty of 90% of the booking fee. Conservative party insiders have admitted a delayed election would cause problems, as the Tories have struggled to raise the \u00a315m for a May polling date.

She rose to become senior vice-president of the agency before joining a smaller agency, Tatham Laird, as chief executive. In 1988, Ms Beers became the first woman to chair the American Association of Advertising Agencies. In 1992, she moved to JWT's sister agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather. At O&amp;M, she was credited with a number of major account wins, including the global IBM advertising account. In 1996, Ms Beers took a back seat at the agency and went into semi-retirement. But, three years later, at the age of 63, she was drafted back to JWT as chairman by the agency's owner Sir Martin Sorrell. Her southern-belle charm has helped Ms Beers achieve what all successful advertising agency executives need - a close enough relationship with her clients to make her indispensable. But Ms Beers' contract with JWT expired last month and she did not renew it; it appears she now has bigger fish to fry.",

In addition to breaking news, it will develop a number of games and special features. One of the highlights of the website is Aristotle, which has been billed as the real A-Z of parliament. It is the UK's first extensive database of historic data about every MP and election candidate since 1992. It serves up easy-to-digest information on a postcode basis. Aristotle, which boasts more than 10,000 individual listings, has taken six months to develop. Users can also play the Turncoats game, developed in conjunction with the Guardian's daily diary.

The decision was made after Department of Agriculture officials successfully argued their case at the European Commission standing veterinary committee in Brussels. Ms Rodgers said that the ban on meat, livestock and dairy products from most of Northern Ireland would be lifted from April 3 if there are no further outbreaks of foot and mouth disease. While in mainland Britain 648 cases of foot and mouth had been confirmed by this morning, there has been only one confirmed outbreak in Northern Ireland, at a sheep farm in Meigh, South Armagh. The resumption of exports does not cover the Newry and Mourne area, which includes the affected farm. The province's first minister, David Trimble, said, \"A degree of normality will return.

They prevented the start of work in Slieve Gullion forest park in south Armagh, not far from the farm at the centre of the province's only outbreak of the disease. Farmers claimed the digging would destroy an area of outstanding natural beauty and roads were reportedly blocked to prevent lorries and digging equipment being moved into the park. This afternoon in London, the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, is expected to pinpoint illegally imported meat as the likely source of the outbreak. A damning official account will claim that pigs were fed meat that was illegally imported for possible use in a Chinese restaurant, he will tell the Commons. Mr Brown is expected to announce a ban on pigswill. A container of the meat clearly labelled for a Chinese restaurant was reportedly found hidden inside a load of household goods after confirmation of a case in Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland. The disease is thought to have infected livestock after it was put in pigswill - produced under licence from the Ministry of Agriculture for fewer than 100 farmers. As the crisis continued to escalate, the army said it was preparing to assist in the mass slaughter of healthy animals at a burial site in Cumbria.

Mr Snow replaces Michael Hann, who is leaving to edit the Guardian's The Editor. Mr Snow, a stalwart of the music press and latterly editorial consultant for Sally O'Sullivan's Cabal Communications, has never edited a football magazine before but admitted \"it's always been my vice\". He said he wanted to bring the humour that has been the trademark of music magazines like Q and Mojo to the magazine. \"For most football fans - unless you support Manchester United - you are losing most of the time, which breeds gallows humour,\" said Mr Snow. \"It's a state veering between desperation and grim determination.\" Four Four Two recorded a 6% year-on-year fall in circulation at the last ABCs to a circulation of 82,539. Football titles across the board suffered badly at the ABCs, with BBC Worldwide's Match of the Day announcing this week it would close following a 25% circulation fall.

      "body": "<p>Nathan Hancock is just home from college, and he's feeling good about life. He's only 15 years old, at least a year younger than his fellow students, but he's thinking about getting a job, and making something of himself. If you'd met him last year, he would have told you a very different story. </p> <p>It was 1998 when Nathan's comprehensive school said they no longer wanted him there. At first they didn't officially exclude him; they simply told him not to bother coming in any more. There had been a fight between two other boys, and somehow Nathan ended up being blamed for it although he always said he'd been in the room next door. There had been earlier incidents at the school involving Nathan, but nothing serious. </p> <p>Nathan has attention deficit disorder. Michael, his father, says what this means is that he's somewhat hyper, a bit of a fidget, but not malicious, not a bad boy. Nothing the teacher shouldn't be able to cope with. But, as with so many children who have special educational needs or emotional and behavioural difficulties, the teachers couldn't cope. A new report from the Children's Society reveals that a hugely disproportionate number of the children excluded from school have special needs. While 3% of schoolchildren are classed as having severe special needs, 40% of the 80 pupils surveyed for the report, Outside, Looking In, had such needs. A further 15% were on the code of practice, meaning some degree of special needs had been acknowledged. </p> <p>Often, pupils only get a statement of special needs after their exclusion, which means their learning difficulties have gone unrecognised at school. It can be a vicious circle. If children with learning difficulties are not being looked after, their behaviour is likely to deteriorate, and when they are excluded their learning difficulties almost invariably increase. </p> <p>Nathan was one of 10,400 young people excluded in England in 1998/99. Although figures have fallen from a 95/96 peak of 12,500, they are still almost four times what they were at the beginning of the 90s. Only 14% of those children permanently excluded were reinstated. Some 69% of exclusions were because of actual or threatened aggressive behaviour. While many of the exclusions concerned children with learning difficulties, some excluded young people were at the opposite end of the spectrum - they were so bright that school bored them and they became a nuisance. The report also shows that black pupils are about six times more likely to be excluded than white pupils - Afro-Caribbean boys are up to eight times more likely to be excluded. This disturbing statistic has been well documented previously. </p> <p>Like many excluded children, the school labelled Nathan a bully while he said that actually he was the victim of bullying - not just by his peers, but by teachers as well. \"The teachers would call me an idiot and say you need drugs because you can't control your temper.\" He was prescribed Ritalin. \"And when I did need help with my work, when I couldn't understand it, they'd just say 'Go and take some pills, Nathan'.\" </p> <p>Nathan was bigger than most of the lads at his school - at 15, he's already over 6ft. His dad says all the men in his family are big and broad. And that may be part of the problem. Nathan looks like a toughie. It's hard to believe that a boy-man like him could be bullied. But then you hear him speak and it's all too feasible. He talks in a soft Cornwall burr, and sounds so vulnerable. His dad calls him a gentle giant. </p> <p>\"It starts to get to you, and it makes you feel degraded, like you're not wanted,\" says Nathan. \"It's horrible. I got depressed sometimes and felt, what's the point in going on? I'm going to be one of those people sleeping on the streets. No school, no job, no nothing.\" You can hear the hurt, and the fear, in his voice. </p> <p>In the three years he has been away from school, Nathan has received around three hours a week of education. The school is supposed to ensure that excluded children receive 25 hours a week of education while away. On average, they get just four. \"It was nothing,\" says Michael Hancock. \"We did everything, sent letters to David Blunkett, but still there was nothing.\" </p> <p>Both Michael and Nathan feel the exclusion was unfair and could have been avoided. Chris Osborne, the Children Society's programme manager for Right To Education, couldn't agree more.\"The whole process of exclusion leaves children and parents isolated. It isn't achieving anything for anyone. We are dealing with some of the most marginalised people in society; the more they are left out the more it leads to problems for these children and society.\" </p> <p>The Children's Society has set up its Genesis project to help reduce the number of exclusions. The project works directly with schools (four, so far), and takes a long-term holistic approach because most of the problems, whether they have their roots in behaviour or learning difficulties or family background, are long-term. </p> <p>Keith Ajebo, headteacher of Deptford Green, says his school has benefited hugely from the project. His school is in an area that has seen exclusions on a shocking scale. At Oliver Goldsmiths, the primary school Damilola Taylor attended before he was murdered last year, there were a reported 150 exclusions after a new headteacher took over. By contrast, Ajebo says Deptford Green excludes one or two kids a year. \"We can pick up more of the people at the edges.\" </p> <p>Ajebo says the project has enabled him to unite the disparate agencies there to help troubled children - drugs counsellors, truancy workers etc. \"There are now six or seven professionals at the school who are not teachers, and staff can refer kids directly to them. Say if a pupil's mum had died, or they were a little wild, or they'd been chucked out of home, there is always someone here who can deal with it.\" </p> <p>Ajebo believes a head must ultimately have the power to exclude. \"When a child's presence is damaging the education of others you have to take that decision,\" he says. In 1999 it was made easier for heads to permanently exclude pupils and harder for parents to appeal against the decision. </p> <p>Yet the government insists that cutting the number of exclusions is a priority. Something doesn't quite add up. Carol Hayden, co-author of Outside, Looking In, says there are conflicting aims. On one hand the government and many parents judge a school purely on its results, on the other schools are being asked to integrate children with severe behavioural and educational difficulties. \"Schools are really valued on their ability to normalise behaviour,\" says Hayden. So when faced with children with real difficulties, it is easier to dismiss them as naughty. \"The government assumes a middle-class consen sus about measuring intelligence and rewarding achievement while wanting to be inclusive.\" </p> <p>Is that impossible? \"No, it's not impossible. But we need a wider range of opportunities on offer. Ironically, we had this in schools before the national curriculum. It used to be much more about teaching children than teaching subjects. Many teachers would say that the national curriculum is the biggest restriction in managing different types of learning.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the biggest problem is the underlying philosophy of exclusion - to punish rather than rehabilitate. \"Just look at the word exclusion. It's horrible. If you were a parent and heard your child is too awful to be with other children you'd be devastated.\" </p> <p>Michael Hancock is one of the roughly 70% of parents in the report convinced that young people with special needs are more likely to be excluded because of the pressure for results. \"Even though money is set aside for special needs, they don't want special needs in schools. It's too much hard work. If you have 100 children and 25 are special needs, and are not going to achieve anything, you've automatically got a 25% failure rate from the start. The easy way to improve results is to remove these children.\" </p> <p>The government is well aware of this.

But the schools kicked up such a fuss that the government has reversed its decision. </p> <p>In 1999 Nathan Hancock was readmitted to his old school.

      "bodyText": "Nathan Hancock is just home from college, and he's feeling good about life. He's only 15 years old, at least a year younger than his fellow students, but he's thinking about getting a job, and making something of himself. If you'd met him last year, he would have told you a very different story. It was 1998 when Nathan's comprehensive school said they no longer wanted him there. At first they didn't officially exclude him; they simply told him not to bother coming in any more. There had been a fight between two other boys, and somehow Nathan ended up being blamed for it although he always said he'd been in the room next door. There had been earlier incidents at the school involving Nathan, but nothing serious. Nathan has attention deficit disorder. Michael, his father, says what this means is that he's somewhat hyper, a bit of a fidget, but not malicious, not a bad boy. Nothing the teacher shouldn't be able to cope with. But, as with so many children who have special educational needs or emotional and behavioural difficulties, the teachers couldn't cope. A new report from the Children's Society reveals that a hugely disproportionate number of the children excluded from school have special needs. While 3% of schoolchildren are classed as having severe special needs, 40% of the 80 pupils surveyed for the report, Outside, Looking In, had such needs. A further 15% were on the code of practice, meaning some degree of special needs had been acknowledged. Often, pupils only get a statement of special needs after their exclusion, which means their learning difficulties have gone unrecognised at school. It can be a vicious circle. If children with learning difficulties are not being looked after, their behaviour is likely to deteriorate, and when they are excluded their learning difficulties almost invariably increase. Nathan was one of 10,400 young people excluded in England in 1998/99. Although figures have fallen from a 95/96 peak of 12,500, they are still almost four times what they were at the beginning of the 90s. Only 14% of those children permanently excluded were reinstated. Some 69% of exclusions were because of actual or threatened aggressive behaviour. While many of the exclusions concerned children with learning difficulties, some excluded young people were at the opposite end of the spectrum - they were so bright that school bored them and they became a nuisance. The report also shows that black pupils are about six times more likely to be excluded than white pupils - Afro-Caribbean boys are up to eight times more likely to be excluded. This disturbing statistic has been well documented previously. Like many excluded children, the school labelled Nathan a bully while he said that actually he was the victim of bullying - not just by his peers, but by teachers as well. \"The teachers would call me an idiot and say you need drugs because you can't control your temper.\" He was prescribed Ritalin. \"And when I did need help with my work, when I couldn't understand it, they'd just say 'Go and take some pills, Nathan'.\" Nathan was bigger than most of the lads at his school - at 15, he's already over 6ft. His dad says all the men in his family are big and broad. And that may be part of the problem. Nathan looks like a toughie. It's hard to believe that a boy-man like him could be bullied. But then you hear him speak and it's all too feasible. He talks in a soft Cornwall burr, and sounds so vulnerable. His dad calls him a gentle giant. \"It starts to get to you, and it makes you feel degraded, like you're not wanted,\" says Nathan. \"It's horrible. I got depressed sometimes and felt, what's the point in going on? I'm going to be one of those people sleeping on the streets. No school, no job, no nothing.\" You can hear the hurt, and the fear, in his voice. In the three years he has been away from school, Nathan has received around three hours a week of education. The school is supposed to ensure that excluded children receive 25 hours a week of education while away. On average, they get just four. \"It was nothing,\" says Michael Hancock. \"We did everything, sent letters to David Blunkett, but still there was nothing.\" Both Michael and Nathan feel the exclusion was unfair and could have been avoided. Chris Osborne, the Children Society's programme manager for Right To Education, couldn't agree more.\"The whole process of exclusion leaves children and parents isolated.

Belgium's King Albert and Queen Paola visited a crisis centre, set up in the nearby town of Wavre, where survivors, passengers in shock and families of victims were being cared for. The prime minister, Guy Verhofstadt, has headed to the scene, delaying a trip to central Europe. In the early afternoon, rescue workers were still picking bodies out, wrapping them in silvery grey body bags and taken away on stretchers. The disaster could have been worse because while the trains tottered, they stayed on rails. If derailed, they would have rolled off the embankment on to the village houses below. \"I saw a black cloud of smoke rise up, the train was rocking back and forward, wobbling,\" said local resident Ameile Jassont, 54, whose home stands next to the track. \"It all happened so fast.\" In 1974, eighteen people died when a train derailed in southern Belgium, the last major accident in Belgium.

      "bodyText": "The UK is to be promoted abroad as a bargain basement tourist destination as a result of the foot and mouth crisis. Under an initiative called \"Great Value Britain\", UK hotels are considering slashing room rates by up to 50% in a drive to combat the fall in bookings. The major hotel chains and small, independent hoteliers alike are prepared to offer huge discounts not just for foreign tourists but for domestic business as well. As a result, the British Tourist Authority's planned \u00a310m global advertising campaign to say Britain is not closed for business may promote the country as great value to visit. Traditionally the UK is seen as an expensive holiday destination. Despite this, 4.1m Americans came to the UK last year, contributing \u00a32.5bn to the national coffers. The Hilton Hotel chain is already offering 50% discounts on group bookings and the chain is considering rolling out discounts for individual visitors. \"We are looking at how we can work with the tourist boards and airlines to help promote the UK as a destination. We are putting our plans together and discounting will be looked at,\" says a Hilton spokesman. Marriott, Bass and Forte are among hotel chains discussing a discounting policy with the British Hospitality Association, whose director Bob Cotton accompanied Tourism minister Janet Anderson to the US last week. Airlines have also been contacted about joining a cut-price campaign. A BHA spokeswoman said: \"All the leading companies are considering it [discounting] and even the smaller rural hotels, who will find it very hard. They will try every method they can.\" She said the foot &amp; mouth crisis was beginning to affect hotel bookings in towns and cities as well as rural areas. The industry now accepts the crisis will run into tourism's all-important Easter period. \"There is no downturn in [foot and mouth] cases. You have to wait for a month to see if the disease is present and Easter is now less than a month away,\" said the BHA spokeswoman.

Harare's unelected council - or commission, as it is called - has launched a blitz against the wooden and corrugated iron structures scattered along roadsides and throughout the city's poorer districts. The commission says that they are illegal. The tuck shop owners say that they have no other means of survival, and suspect a mixture of political vengeance and ruthless business interests are behind the destruction. The 'tuck shop' name might derive from the days of British rule, but in Zimbabwe they are very different from the ones frequented by Billy Bunter and generations of English public school boys. In Harare, tuck shops are a source of groceries, clothing, even furniture for those who cannot afford supermarket prices or to travel the long distances from townships to shopping centres. In turn, they provide a means for the growing army of Zimbabweans driven out of work by Robert Mugabe's disastrous land and economic policies - unemployment now stands at 60% - to eke out a living. So the owners were understandably horrified when council workers descended on hundreds of rickety tuck shops and began destroying them earlier this month. \"They are punishing those of us who are already suffering,\" said Esther Mlambo, the owner of a tuck shop selling groceries. \"They came and destroyed my tuck shop and now I have to try and sell beside the road but I cannot put out all my stocks and the rains are very bad at the moment.

Meanwhile, culture secretary Chris Smith is begging holidaymakers not to avoid the British Isles. The Mirror The Mirror devotes its front page to urge Tony Blair to put aside foot and mouth and go for a May 3 election, as voted for by its readers. \"It would be an unwise Tony Blair who refuses to listen\", says Paul Routledge, adding: \"Labour must get on top of this crisis.\" The Mirror prints gruesome pictures of lambs being buried in sober black and white, under the headline: \"It's like finding a cure for the common cold.\" Daily Express What an aching difference there is between a Mirror reader and an Express reader. According to an Express reader poll, a resounding 67% think Tony Blair should postpone the election or risk being labelled \"arrogant\" because of the foot and mouth crisis. The Guardian There is a simple start the government could make to overhaul Britain's food production system - abolish the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Guardian is the only broadsheet to publish the grave pictures in colour and risks offending squeamish readers by opening its account with: \"Downwind, there was a smell like diarrhoea and clotted blood\". It says should the government delay the election, millions will have already been wasted on the campaign. Daily Mail Even gorier: \"I expect them [the sheep] to come tumbling out as big balls of fluff. Instead they slide out in one huge glob... and hardly resemble sheep at all.\" The Independent The Independent says a new stench is pervading the countryside - that of a cover-up, with officials refusing to release two separate reports on the farm thought to be the origin of the crisis.",

The Green party of England and Wales, which is fielding 130 candidates in the general election, has fallen foul of rules drawn up after devolution of power to parliaments in Scotland and Wales. To qualify for election broadcasts on channels and radio stations received across England, Scotland and Wales - including C4, Channel 5 and BBC radio - parties must field candidates in one sixth of seats in each country. The Greens easily pass that threshold in England and Wales, but do not contest seats in Scotland, which are fought by the Scottish Green party. The Greens claim they are being penalised further because, under special exceptions agreed by broadcasters, the Scottish Nationalists and Plaid Cymru - who by definition do not stand in England - will qualify for nationwide BBC broadcasts because they have more than one MP at Westminster. The Greens have been advised that they have a legal case under the European convention on human rights. Penny Kemp, chair of the party's national executive, said: \"Unelected and unaccountable officials, on the basis of inconsistent and illogical rules made on their own whim, are basically preventing voters from hearing about the Green party.\"",

      "bodyText": "Ken Loach, the award-winning film maker, is to make a party election broadcast attacking the Labour party in the forthcoming general election. The acclaimed director of films such as Kes and My Name is Joe will make his directorial debut for the Socialist Alliance party with a five minute broadcast, to be shown in the run-up to the election. The 64-year old film maker is already one of a number of high-profile backers of the fledgling party but he has now agreed to make their TV broadcast too. The film - which is currently being written - will focus on the failures of the Labour government in areas like the privatisation of air traffic control, the public-private partnership for the tube and a lack of investment in public services. It is the first time the Socialist Alliance has qualified for a broadcasting slot, awarded to parties fielding more than 100 candidates across the UK. In 1997 election there was controversy over an election broadcast by the British National party, in which leader John Tyndall stood on the white cliffs of Dover and called for voluntary repatriation of immigrants. Mr Loach made his first party election broadcast for Arthur Scargill in the 1997 contest, who was fighting under the banner of the Socialist Labour party. Mr Scargill will be fighting again this time around, in Peter Mandelson's Hartlepool constituency, but not as part of the Socialist Alliance. The election broadcast, which is expected to be shot on a minimal budget just before being transmitted, is being written by the former editor of the Labour left briefing, Mike Marqusee, the partner of Liz Davies, a former Labour party councillor who recently announced her defection to the Socialist Alliance. Mr Loach, whose latest film Bread and Roses, which details the exploitation of hispanic workers in Los Angeles and comes out next month, joins a \"glitterati\" of left-wing celebrities supporting the Socialist Alliance, including the playwrights Harold Pinter and Tariq Ali, the journalist, Paul Foot, and the comedian, Jeremy Hardy. The solicitor representing the Paddington rail crash victims, Louise Christian, is standing for the party in the constituency of the immigration minister Barbara Roche.

The Luxembourg-based company is buying General Electric's satellite operation for \u00a33.5bn in a deal confirming its status as a global player. It is understood SES and GE will announce the deal today and they are confident the transaction will receive regulatory approval on both sides of the Atlantic. As well as its market-leading position in Europe, SES also has co-ownership deals with companies in Asia and Latin America. The GE acquisition will enable SES to launch its ambitious broadband internet strategy in the US in a bid to outmanoeuvre the powerful cable companies. Internet services only provide 5% of the company's revenues - which reached \u00a3522m last year - but SES is hoping the US market will boost that percentage. More than 22m European homes use the SES broadband service, which supplies constant internet access. However, some industry sceptics believe now is the wrong time to launch the service in the US, which is teetering on the brink of recession. SES sprang to prominence in the UK this month after striking a \u00a3100m deal with ITV to beam the network's programmes onto a digital satellite platform.

      "body": "<p>Publishing entrepreneur turned organic farmer Peter Kindersley today launched high court proceedings challenging the government's policy of slaughtering healthy animals to combat the foot and mouth crisis.</p> <p>Mr Kindersley, 59, who was behind Dorling Kindersley's educational children's books and is now a commercial organic farmer in Berkshire, lodged application papers at London's law courts seeking a judicial review of the policy.</p> <p>The farmer, who arrived at the courts today with his wife Juliet, 60, says his application is supported by expert evidence \"showing that a policy of vaccinating animals would be more effective\".</p> <p>His application will be considered by a single judge sitting in private within the next couple of days. If the judge decides there is an \"arguable\" case a full hearing of the application for judicial review is likely to go ahead in the next couple of weeks as a matter of urgency. Speaking on the steps outside the courts, Mr Kindersley said: \"The scientific strength of the case for the alternatives to the mass slaughter of healthy livestock, such as vaccination, has been all the more compelling by the shortcomings of the government's present efforts.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I welcome today's belated recognition by the prime minister of the potential of vaccination. Indeed there are mainstream veterinary, economic and historical reasons why the cull is wrong.\"</p> <p>He added: \"If allowed to proceed the judicial review will test the rational basis upon which ministers have arrived at their present action.</p> <p>\"We will be asking the court to call a halt to the slaughter of healthy animals and to refer the matter back to ministers for urgent reconsideration.\"</p> <p>Mr Kindersley and his wife founded the Dorling Kindersley publishing house in the 1970s.

      "bodyText": "Publishing entrepreneur turned organic farmer Peter Kindersley today launched high court proceedings challenging the government's policy of slaughtering healthy animals to combat the foot and mouth crisis. Mr Kindersley, 59, who was behind Dorling Kindersley's educational children's books and is now a commercial organic farmer in Berkshire, lodged application papers at London's law courts seeking a judicial review of the policy. The farmer, who arrived at the courts today with his wife Juliet, 60, says his application is supported by expert evidence \"showing that a policy of vaccinating animals would be more effective\". His application will be considered by a single judge sitting in private within the next couple of days. If the judge decides there is an \"arguable\" case a full hearing of the application for judicial review is likely to go ahead in the next couple of weeks as a matter of urgency. Speaking on the steps outside the courts, Mr Kindersley said: \"The scientific strength of the case for the alternatives to the mass slaughter of healthy livestock, such as vaccination, has been all the more compelling by the shortcomings of the government's present efforts.\" He added: \"I welcome today's belated recognition by the prime minister of the potential of vaccination. Indeed there are mainstream veterinary, economic and historical reasons why the cull is wrong.\" He added: \"If allowed to proceed the judicial review will test the rational basis upon which ministers have arrived at their present action. \"We will be asking the court to call a halt to the slaughter of healthy animals and to refer the matter back to ministers for urgent reconsideration.\" Mr Kindersley and his wife founded the Dorling Kindersley publishing house in the 1970s. It was sold to Penguin Books last year. They have a 2,500-acre farm at Lambourn, Berks, with beef, sheep, poultry and cereals as well as a few pigs. Mr Kindersley has put together a legal case through solicitors Burges Salmon and a technical one through the Elm Farm Research Centre, a progressive farming trust.

      "bodyText": "Billboard media owner Maiden Group has brushed off the turmoil in the advertising industry by more than doubling its profits. Maiden has benefited from a swing towards outdoor advertising, with television and ITV the main losers. The group said its sector grew by 20% last year, while ITV revenues are expected to show negative growth of 1% in 2001. Maiden said pre-tax profits for 2000 rose from \u00a35.1m to \u00a313m, with revenues climbing 21% to \u00a386.1m. \"Even with growing uncertainty in the economy and a potential reduction in growth in advertising spend, we continue to expect to be able to outperform the cycle,\" said Ron Zeghibe, chief executive of Maiden. Maiden now has more than 32,000 advertising panels, bolstered by last year's acquisition of four smaller rivals, including GMG Metro and CP Posters. \"We have leading and valuable positions in key areas of the outdoor market and we expect to see good returns from them,\" added Mr Zeghibe. According to Maiden's research, 83% of the top 200 advertisers now use the outdoor medium and the sector took just 6% of dot.coms' now non-existent marketing spend. The group added 2001 had started strongly, with bookings for the first quarter climbing by 22% compared with the same period last year. As with all companies involved in the advertising and marketing sector, Maiden is keen to distance itself from the economic uncertainty that is giving the industry a rough ride at the moment. \"Independent forecasters continue to predict the medium will grow at a faster rate in the next few years than either television or press. \"Advertisers are finding the medium increasingly attractive and are committing a greater spend to it,\" said Mr Zeghibe.

      "byline": "Katie Roiphe",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>One can't help noticing the exquisite irony that Ellen Fein, co-author of The Rules: Time-tested Secrets for Capturing the Heart of Mr Right, The Rules II and the forthcoming Rules III: Time-tested Secrets for Making your Marriage Work, is getting divorced. And one can't help feeling a certain satisfaction that someone who told millions of women the best way to marital bliss is not to talk much on dates may be reconsidering her position.</p> <p>Fein made the announcement on the eve of publication of her latest book, which claims that \"it is easier to stay married than get married\". She and her co-author, Sherrie Schneider, suggest that women should defer to their husbands, and recommend that they grow their hair, as men find long hair more attractive.</p> <p>The 43-year-old had been married to pharmacist Paul Feingertz for 16 years and, along with Schneider, constantly referred to her own marital success when promoting her books. So what went wrong? Did Fein fail to read between her own lines?</p> <p>It's too easy to dismiss The Rules, to mock them for their earnestness and deplore them for their sexist, condescending attitude towards women. Because this silly paper-back, with pink ribbons all over its cover, obviously captured the imagination of millions of women all over the world. Five years after it first came out, I have noticed The Rules on all sorts of intelligent people's bookshelves, tucked away between The Brothers Karamazov and Zadie Smith. I have noticed smart women buying it and following its ethos.</p> <p>More than that, I have noticed the spirit of The Rules entering into people's conversations about relationships in a more diffuse way. I have heard educated, liberal women talking about how long to wait before calling a man back, or whether the date should be in her neighbourhood, or how long to wait until sleeping with him, as if there is some secret formula, some mathematical principle to romantic happiness that she has yet to divine.</p> <p>I have also heard professionally aggressive, ambitious women worry about seeming too aggressive in their romantic lives if they call a man first. It is strange that the 50s courtship rituals our mothers fought so hard to get away from should come to be so appealing, so necessary, to a new generation. But it seems that The Rules tapped into a larger anxiety in the culture; in their simplistic, jingoistic way, they expressed a need, a yearning, a worry about old-fashioned courtship that is worth taking into account.</p> <p>One of the reasons The Rules has been so successful is that a whole generation of women is marrying later. It has become socially acceptable and entirely common for a woman to spend her 20s focusing on her career and hanging around with her friends and running around with different men. But then, at a certain point, in her early 30s, comes a fear that she will live her entire life like a character trapped in Sex and the City, sipping cosmopolitans at a bar in Manolo Blahniks when she is in her 50s.</p> <p>She has established her professional life, she has had lots of relationships with men, but marriage itself has come to seem elusive and alien - and she begins to ask herself, how do you get there again? How did I get off track? All the freedom and feminism and sweet drinks and promotions don't hold the answer. And suddenly the comically old-fashioned way of doing things, with dates and flowers and rings, starts to seem more desirable.</p> <p>Buried in The Rules is the faintest hint of a Jane Austen plot: the man who pursues and the woman who is pursued, the unspoken, delicate, romantic game that unfolds between them. What The Rules offers, in its clumsy, excruciating way, is a path back to that mystery, that loveliness and ease. It promises women not just that they will get married, but that they will be in the traditional position of being chased.</p> <p>Why should women who are aggressive and ambitious in every other area of life want that so much? Why should they want the traditional feeling of being sought after? Why should they want to surrender control?</p> <p>The truth is that all the equality we have and require in the workplace is not necessarily what we want in our romantic lives. The journalist who calls strangers all day long for a living may wait for a man to call her for dinner. The woman who is an aggressive lawyer at the office may not want to feel aggressive in her personal life; she may want to feel feminine, taken care of. She may want to give up control because it is pleasurable; it is fun to play that game for an evening, for a week.</p> <p>With all of its absurd rigidity, its humourless desperation, The Rules offers women old-fashioned roles to play with. To have your dinner paid for, even though you could pay for it yourself. To let him choose the place. To surrender control in just this one area of your life for just this short period of time, even though you are perfectly capable of taking care of yourself.</p> <p>The Rules taps into the stories we were told as children, the fairy tales and knights, the Mr Darcys and Heathcliffs. It whispers of happy endings that have begun to seem arduous and complicated and out of reach. It may be that these retrograde fantasies still exist because the women's movement hasn't cleared them away; or it may be that they will always exist.</p> <p>Is the idea of a man paying for dinner so appealing because we know we can take care of ourselves? Or are we still insecure about our independence?</p> <p>The truth is that there is something infinitely reassuring to everyone about men pursuing and women being pursued. For women, I think it is not so much about \"capturing Mr Right\" as about capturing an image of ourselves that we find appealing. Maybe we shouldn't find it appealing, in this new millennium, but we do.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One can't help noticing the exquisite irony that Ellen Fein, co-author of The Rules: Time-tested Secrets for Capturing the Heart of Mr Right, The Rules II and the forthcoming Rules III: Time-tested Secrets for Making your Marriage Work, is getting divorced. And one can't help feeling a certain satisfaction that someone who told millions of women the best way to marital bliss is not to talk much on dates may be reconsidering her position. Fein made the announcement on the eve of publication of her latest book, which claims that \"it is easier to stay married than get married\". She and her co-author, Sherrie Schneider, suggest that women should defer to their husbands, and recommend that they grow their hair, as men find long hair more attractive. The 43-year-old had been married to pharmacist Paul Feingertz for 16 years and, along with Schneider, constantly referred to her own marital success when promoting her books. So what went wrong? Did Fein fail to read between her own lines? It's too easy to dismiss The Rules, to mock them for their earnestness and deplore them for their sexist, condescending attitude towards women. Because this silly paper-back, with pink ribbons all over its cover, obviously captured the imagination of millions of women all over the world. Five years after it first came out, I have noticed The Rules on all sorts of intelligent people's bookshelves, tucked away between The Brothers Karamazov and Zadie Smith. I have noticed smart women buying it and following its ethos. More than that, I have noticed the spirit of The Rules entering into people's conversations about relationships in a more diffuse way. I have heard educated, liberal women talking about how long to wait before calling a man back, or whether the date should be in her neighbourhood, or how long to wait until sleeping with him, as if there is some secret formula, some mathematical principle to romantic happiness that she has yet to divine. I have also heard professionally aggressive, ambitious women worry about seeming too aggressive in their romantic lives if they call a man first. It is strange that the 50s courtship rituals our mothers fought so hard to get away from should come to be so appealing, so necessary, to a new generation. But it seems that The Rules tapped into a larger anxiety in the culture; in their simplistic, jingoistic way, they expressed a need, a yearning, a worry about old-fashioned courtship that is worth taking into account. One of the reasons The Rules has been so successful is that a whole generation of women is marrying later. It has become socially acceptable and entirely common for a woman to spend her 20s focusing on her career and hanging around with her friends and running around with different men. But then, at a certain point, in her early 30s, comes a fear that she will live her entire life like a character trapped in Sex and the City, sipping cosmopolitans at a bar in Manolo Blahniks when she is in her 50s. She has established her professional life, she has had lots of relationships with men, but marriage itself has come to seem elusive and alien - and she begins to ask herself, how do you get there again? How did I get off track? All the freedom and feminism and sweet drinks and promotions don't hold the answer. And suddenly the comically old-fashioned way of doing things, with dates and flowers and rings, starts to seem more desirable. Buried in The Rules is the faintest hint of a Jane Austen plot: the man who pursues and the woman who is pursued, the unspoken, delicate, romantic game that unfolds between them. What The Rules offers, in its clumsy, excruciating way, is a path back to that mystery, that loveliness and ease. It promises women not just that they will get married, but that they will be in the traditional position of being chased. Why should women who are aggressive and ambitious in every other area of life want that so much? Why should they want the traditional feeling of being sought after? Why should they want to surrender control? The truth is that all the equality we have and require in the workplace is not necessarily what we want in our romantic lives. The journalist who calls strangers all day long for a living may wait for a man to call her for dinner. The woman who is an aggressive lawyer at the office may not want to feel aggressive in her personal life; she may want to feel feminine, taken care of. She may want to give up control because it is pleasurable; it is fun to play that game for an evening, for a week. With all of its absurd rigidity, its humourless desperation, The Rules offers women old-fashioned roles to play with. To have your dinner paid for, even though you could pay for it yourself. To let him choose the place. To surrender control in just this one area of your life for just this short period of time, even though you are perfectly capable of taking care of yourself. The Rules taps into the stories we were told as children, the fairy tales and knights, the Mr Darcys and Heathcliffs. It whispers of happy endings that have begun to seem arduous and complicated and out of reach. It may be that these retrograde fantasies still exist because the women's movement hasn't cleared them away; or it may be that they will always exist. Is the idea of a man paying for dinner so appealing because we know we can take care of ourselves? Or are we still insecure about our independence? The truth is that there is something infinitely reassuring to everyone about men pursuing and women being pursued. For women, I think it is not so much about \"capturing Mr Right\" as about capturing an image of ourselves that we find appealing. Maybe we shouldn't find it appealing, in this new millennium, but we do.",

      "body": "<p>Lord Filkin of Pimlico is widely credited as being the man who invented best value, the government's council service improvement regime. </p> <p>Some claim he came up with only the name, others say he was the man behind some of the key ideas as well. Whatever the case, the story goes to show just how highly the local government community rates the peer's influence in the corridors of power.</p> <p>It might also explain why Geoff Filkin, as he used to be known, is currently such a hot tip for a ministerial post, possibly taking on Lord Whitty's job covering the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and hence responsibility for local government. </p> <p>The rumours, which started in Whitehall, have spread like wildfire and are very credible. Lord Filkin has spent a good part of his 57 years working for local authorities, first as a town planner, then as chief executive of Reading borough council, and finally as secretary of the Association of District Councils.</p> <p>Despite his impressive credentials, the rumours are being passed around with a slight sense of dread. </p> <p>This is partly because of the peer's political background. He has been tainted in the eyes of some by his close involvement with the New Local Government Network (NLGN) - a modernising think tank that has been attacked over its perceived enthusiasm for directly elected mayors and council service privatisation. </p> <p>At least one high profile founder member of the network - Jack Dromey, of the Transport and General Workers' Union - left the organisation over its stance.</p> <p>The NLGN has called for the government to take the controversial move of imposing referendums for directly elected mayors in the UK's major cities. </p> <p>It has also argued that councils need to leave behind their role as direct service providers and take on a more strategic \"community leadership\" role as an all-purpose problem solver for local people.</p> <p>Neither of these moves was calculated to endear the network to rank and file councillors.

      "bodyText": "Lord Filkin of Pimlico is widely credited as being the man who invented best value, the government's council service improvement regime. Some claim he came up with only the name, others say he was the man behind some of the key ideas as well. Whatever the case, the story goes to show just how highly the local government community rates the peer's influence in the corridors of power. It might also explain why Geoff Filkin, as he used to be known, is currently such a hot tip for a ministerial post, possibly taking on Lord Whitty's job covering the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and hence responsibility for local government. The rumours, which started in Whitehall, have spread like wildfire and are very credible. Lord Filkin has spent a good part of his 57 years working for local authorities, first as a town planner, then as chief executive of Reading borough council, and finally as secretary of the Association of District Councils. Despite his impressive credentials, the rumours are being passed around with a slight sense of dread. This is partly because of the peer's political background. He has been tainted in the eyes of some by his close involvement with the New Local Government Network (NLGN) - a modernising think tank that has been attacked over its perceived enthusiasm for directly elected mayors and council service privatisation. At least one high profile founder member of the network - Jack Dromey, of the Transport and General Workers' Union - left the organisation over its stance. The NLGN has called for the government to take the controversial move of imposing referendums for directly elected mayors in the UK's major cities. It has also argued that councils need to leave behind their role as direct service providers and take on a more strategic \"community leadership\" role as an all-purpose problem solver for local people. Neither of these moves was calculated to endear the network to rank and file councillors. Many local politicians are deeply opposed to directly-elected mayors, which they believe concentrate too much power in the hands of one person. A significant number of councillors also want authorities to keep their direct service role. The alternative, they argue, will inevitably leading to more outsourcing and a diminishing role for local government. Lord Filkin has a reputation for pursuing his vision of council reform with an almost evangelical zeal. He has been described as \"a repressed monk\" - someone who needs to devote his life to something, but has never really found religion enough. This raises questions about whether he would be the right man for the job. One friend of the peer describes him as \"somebody who wants to look at ways of driving the agenda forward\". But the signs are that the government's current intention is to let best value and the new political structures bed down before deciding whether more reform is needed. Only one major bill is expected for councils in a second Labour term, and that is likely to propose modest reforms of the local government finance system. This suggests Lord Filkin might not enjoy the kind of backseat role this legislative programme would require. The peer's programme for local government reform is summed up in the NLGN's discussion document, Towards a new localism, of which he was co-author. Aimed at giving more power to councils, it proposes a combination of local government proportional representation, new tax-raising powers, a new department for decentralisation and devolution, and partnership contracts - five-year community plans with new financial freedoms attached and an average \u00a38m in extra funding every year for every council involved. This manifesto is one of the key reasons for Jack Dromey revising his opinion of both the NLGN and Lord Filkin. \"There he is, this highly intelligent architect of best value associated with a move away from central government compulsion, who then became associated with a new politics of compulsion, but who's now playing quite a positive role in sending the government down a different path,\" said Mr Dromey. \"It wouldn't surprise me for one minute if he ended up in government.\" Those close to the peer say he has not yet been asked to become a minister. But with the general election date still not fixed, and a reshuffle unlikely before then, there is no reason why the prime minister should have started tipping the wink to cabinet ministers, let alone their more junior colleagues. There are also questions over whether Lord Filkin would accept the job. As a career bureaucrat, he might not want to dip his toe in the political waters, and he may not be interested in the hectic lifestyle and low profile of a junior minister. If, however, he could be persuaded to take the job, the general consensus is that he would do it well. It would certainly be a fitting reward for a man whose career has been devoted to local government.",

The average amount of alcohol consumed by 11- to 15-year-olds in 1990 was 0.8 units a week, according to the Office of National Statistics. By 1998 it was 1.6 units. About 1,000 children aged under 15 are admitted to hospital every year with alcohol poisoning. </p> <p>Why are young people drinking more and earlier? Strathclyde University researchers, in a study published in the magazine Addiction, examined in detail how drinks are marketed.

The mid-1990s were the heydey of these alcopops, and by 1998 Britain's market in so-called flavoured alcoholic beverages was estimated at \u00a3750m. Today a new range of products includes pre-mixed cocktails and strong bottled beers. They share bright labelling and often outlandish names that appeal to the young. Quite how young remains a matter for debate. </p> <p>The Strathclyde team suggests that products such as Bacardi Breezers appeal to \"established drinkers\" - the 16- to 24-year-olds.

The drinks come in clear bottles which show off their bright contents. They have a screw top, so are easy to carry around. </p> <p>The researchers claim that Mad Dog meets the \"needs and taste preferences of experimental drinkers\". The taste of alcohol is disguised by the fruity flavours. The high alcohol content satisfies the need for \"rapid intoxication\". They also claim that the drink tends to be sold through smaller outlets which are less easy to regulate and less likely to enforce age limits. </p> <p>The Drinks Company, which imports MD 20/20, refused to say how many bottles it sold. Its joint managing director, Mike Gilmer, said there was no research on who drank the product but most drinkers would be over 25.

But critics argue that the sanctions it can take are limited, and they are uneasy that the group was set up by manufacturers. </p> <p>The Strathclyde researchers believe that manufacturers \"no longer think of themselves as in the alcohol business but in the mood-altering substance business\". </p> <p>In recent years the Portman Group's panel has upheld complaints against a beer called Cannabis and a lager called Greenleaf Hemp. That importers and manufacturers even thought about trying to get such products into bars and off-licences seems to back up the point. </p> <p>The trend is particularly worrying because often young people with addiction problems take drugs and drink alcohol. </p> <p>Back in the centre of Nottingham, the tactics that bars and pubs use to draw youngsters in are obvious.

The time comes when there's little left to say about a disaster that's immutable. Already beginning to be bored with another piece about foot and mouth? I guess so. But that's the point. The boredom threshold is a political fact, as an apathetic nation is lured towards an election it neither very badly wants nor very badly doesn't want, during a calamity that many people, in their shoulder- shrugging British way, learn to live with.</p> <p>As decision day approaches for Tony Blair, this has to be a big part of his judgment. What will the voters really care about? Will they rage at him for going too soon, if he sticks with the four-year blueprint ending on May 3? Or soon forget about the horrors they now see on the screen every night? My bet is that he'll settle for a cautious version of the second scenario. Long afraid of apathy's low turn-out, he can now turn apathy to advantage. June 7 would be a good moment to split the difference.</p> <p>When it happens, this will be an election far removed from 1997 in everything except the approximate result. Staring at these empty fields, and smoking pyres, and slaughterhouse soldiers, not to mention failing trains, and rundown hospitals, and struggling schools, voters need a vast reservoir of tolerance to prevent them rising up in rage to punish the nearest available prime minister. But apathy, and William Hague, will not find them wanting.</p> <p>Apathy will ensure, first, that foot and mouth disappears from most screens within a week of the election starting. Already bored with it, the majority will soon forget. The campaign will take over all the headlines, because that's what all the parties want and all the media will gladly respond to. Part of the reason why foot and mouth has eaten into the national mood is because there are no pictures to knock it off the bulletins. A campaign, even one that has a hard job making people care, will soon change that.</p> <p>It needs to be preceded by the impression that the government is at last in charge. That may not happen by May, but will certainly have climaxed before the autumn. In retrospect it's clear that ministers weren't in charge from the beginning. They got the urgency of the thing all wrong. For a few days, Hague at last managed to make the government and not the opposition the target of big questions. But field marshal Blair has handed over command to the brigadiers, who can be heard barking over the air-waves with unagricultural authority.</p> <p>Though the cases will keep coming for many months after the curve declines, they're still seen more as acts of God and pigswill than the results of political failure. There is political failure, in the rundown of vet services for farm surveillance, but as with so much else the blame is divided: the Thatcher plague on the public sector, as yet unrectified by her successor.</p> <p>Meanwhile, time passes. F and M, from being a catastrophic novelty, becomes part of almost normal life. Other realities move up alongside it. It's specious to pretend, as the spinners now do, that the whole world is looking to British elections being held in May for proof that the country is still part of the planet. But governing is paralysed by strategic indecision, the blight of pre-election phases in all countries everywhere, regardless of whether they're discretionary or fixed-term. Already, it seems to this observer, the case for indefinite delay is trumped by the need to settle things. What has changed, since the days when imminent elections seemed an affront to democracy, is the discovery that there's no likely time when they would seem much less of one.</p> <p>These preliminaries should certainly be expected to change the nature of the campaign. It will not be joyful, and is less likely than it was to be casually venomous. The original plans of both main sides were firing up to emphasise anger and contempt. They were going to make it as bitterly personal as they could find the words for: the Tories because they had nothing else to say except how exquisitely they abominated Tony Blair, Labour because it needed something to stimulate the nightmares of supporters and drive them to polls in which they may otherwise have lost faith.</p> <p>No doubt there will still be some of this. But the sombre context indicates a different presentation, especially by the government. At a time when crisis is still a word in voters' consciousness, ministers will want to emphasise their gravitas, their experience, their dutiful sense of responsibility, even, lord help us, their competence. Instead of parading their bright-eyed triumphs, they'll be offering themselves as solid custodians of the future, the safest pair of hands to deal with future pigswill visitations or any other national crises.</p> <p>On the face of it, this should be a pretty incredible claim. Standing back from our politics, foreign visitors are struck by the terrible state of things here. These may all have come in a rush, and, deep down, the Blair administration may have laid the ground for massive improvements at some time later. But with the fields stripped bare and the railways in chaos and doctors gloom-mongering the NHS and police numbers in decline and sundry ministers unable to give an honest account of their public lives, the election ought to be lost. That it isn't going to be is tribute to the happy congruence between Blairism's need to be judged in the long term not the short, and the voters' apathetic disbelief in the possibility of anything better. A dismal verdict, I'm afraid. But the most plausible one available.</p> <p>The best thing to do now would be to announce that all elections, the local and the general, will be held on June 7. This would pay necessary respect to those people, especially in rural areas, who would be justifiably affronted by a rush to the polls, or by local elections that can be changed by statute without terrible insult to anyone. A month is a long delay, and time enough for man to gain some control over the contagion that is decimating the herds. The prime minister would be seen to do his governing duty, at some cost to his political plans. The first half of the allotted period would be spent showing he had got his priorities right.</p> <p>The second half could then see a campaign that wasn't distracted by charges of opportunism. The balance of opportunism has in any case swung round. It's not at all clear, after all that's happened, that going early is going best for the Labour vote. But all that's happened means that Britain needs a government in place, settled enough to confront the crisis that may be more serious than foot and mouth: a downturn in European economies that could yet be our really fearsome autumn rendering.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/subsection/0,7370,463511,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a><br></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459872,00.html\">20.03.2001: Looking forward to easter, nervously</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html  \">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

      "body": "<p>The mass grave in Cumbria is the most brutal attempt to get a grip on an epidemic far worse than anyone expected by a government desperate to avoid criticism.</p> <p>For three weeks Nick Brown, agriculture minister, insisted that the foot and mouth outbreak was under control, and then his confidence began to evaporate until finally he conceded that the disease was winning.</p> <p>Angry farmers were the first sign of trouble 10 days ago when they objected to a Ministry of Agriculture (Maff) plan to kill healthy animals to prevent the spread of the disease. What had been a cross-party consensus broke down when piles of rotting animals remained in fields for days in Devon and Cumbria. What started as a few voices demanding a vaccination rather than slaughter became a chorus. The united front of politicians, farmers and vets fell apart.</p> <p>Maff was in trouble; its policies were seen not to be keeping up with the crisis. The prime minister intervened. But what has gone wrong and why?</p> <p>Mr Brown, sensitive to the fact that he would carry the can for any mistakes, has constantly deferred to the advice of the chief vet, Jim Scudamore. From the first day that the outbreak was identified at an abattoir in Essex, his has been a copybook response.</p> <p>First all animal exports were stopped and a tracing system for the pigs involved was put in place. Two days later the origin of the Essex outbreak had been traced to Haddon-on-the-Wall in Northumberland, and Mr Scudamore knew Britain was in trouble. The diseased pigs in Northumberland had been infectious for two weeks; it was urgent to trace every animal involved.</p> <p>What happened next was a nightmare. Unknown to Mr Scudamore, the pigs had infected sheep a distance away on another farm. These had been sent to market in Hexham, then on to Longtown in Cumbria, and on to Devon, Northampton, and onward for export.</p> <p>The sheer volume of mixing and marketing of sheep was so great that no one at Maff was aware of it. The nightmare has been getting worse every day.</p> <p>The logistics of identifying the disease, valuing the stock, killing and then disposing of carcasses became too much for Maff to deal with. Delays led to mounting criticism, with the National Farmers Union and the Conservatives demanding army intervention.</p> <p>The first problem the ministry had to admit was a shortage of vets to identify outbreaks. The 220 ministry staff vets soon became inadequate for the task. Once a vet had been in contact with foot and mouth he could not inspect another farm animal for five days. While the virus does not normally infect humans, it can live in the throat for three days.</p> <p>Appeals were immediately sent round the world for volunteer vets. More than 100 have flown in from as far away as Australia, the US and Canada. Final year students from veterinary college and army vets were drafted in, and private vets were paid \u00a3150 a day, later increased to \u00a3250, to help out.</p> <p>The issue became a crisis when Maff's hired experts said the main problem in containing the disease was delay between the call from the farmer and destruction of the animals. More vets were crucial.</p> <p>To ease their burden, army logistic teams were brought in to do their administration. The time between visiting a diseased animals and going on to the next outbreak has been shortened to 72 hours. Mr Blair pledged that the time between the first call and slaughter would be less than 24 hours.</p> <p>The second problem, which Maff blamed partly on farmers, was the time taken for valuations of animals before slaughter.</p> <p>Every farmer has a right under the Animal Health Act to have animals valued before being killed. On a farm with 2,000 assorted sheep, cattle and goats, that can take time. A farmer also has the right to choose his valuer and to appeal if he thinks the valuation is wrong, a process that could cost two days.</p> <p>The ministry has provided blanket valuations slightly more generous than the farmer could expect. It will cost the taxpayer millions.</p> <p>The third difficulty was getting the slaughter teams to the farms to kill hundreds of animals.</p> <p>Disposing of the carcasses brought most problems - and the loudest criticism from farmers, the NFU and the opposition.</p> <p>In the 1967 outbreak most bodies were buried, but modern environmental scruples about poisoning water supplies prevented that in many places.

      "bodyText": "The mass grave in Cumbria is the most brutal attempt to get a grip on an epidemic far worse than anyone expected by a government desperate to avoid criticism. For three weeks Nick Brown, agriculture minister, insisted that the foot and mouth outbreak was under control, and then his confidence began to evaporate until finally he conceded that the disease was winning. Angry farmers were the first sign of trouble 10 days ago when they objected to a Ministry of Agriculture (Maff) plan to kill healthy animals to prevent the spread of the disease. What had been a cross-party consensus broke down when piles of rotting animals remained in fields for days in Devon and Cumbria. What started as a few voices demanding a vaccination rather than slaughter became a chorus. The united front of politicians, farmers and vets fell apart. Maff was in trouble; its policies were seen not to be keeping up with the crisis. The prime minister intervened. But what has gone wrong and why? Mr Brown, sensitive to the fact that he would carry the can for any mistakes, has constantly deferred to the advice of the chief vet, Jim Scudamore. From the first day that the outbreak was identified at an abattoir in Essex, his has been a copybook response. First all animal exports were stopped and a tracing system for the pigs involved was put in place. Two days later the origin of the Essex outbreak had been traced to Haddon-on-the-Wall in Northumberland, and Mr Scudamore knew Britain was in trouble. The diseased pigs in Northumberland had been infectious for two weeks; it was urgent to trace every animal involved. What happened next was a nightmare. Unknown to Mr Scudamore, the pigs had infected sheep a distance away on another farm. These had been sent to market in Hexham, then on to Longtown in Cumbria, and on to Devon, Northampton, and onward for export. The sheer volume of mixing and marketing of sheep was so great that no one at Maff was aware of it. The nightmare has been getting worse every day. The logistics of identifying the disease, valuing the stock, killing and then disposing of carcasses became too much for Maff to deal with. Delays led to mounting criticism, with the National Farmers Union and the Conservatives demanding army intervention. The first problem the ministry had to admit was a shortage of vets to identify outbreaks. The 220 ministry staff vets soon became inadequate for the task. Once a vet had been in contact with foot and mouth he could not inspect another farm animal for five days. While the virus does not normally infect humans, it can live in the throat for three days. Appeals were immediately sent round the world for volunteer vets. More than 100 have flown in from as far away as Australia, the US and Canada. Final year students from veterinary college and army vets were drafted in, and private vets were paid \u00a3150 a day, later increased to \u00a3250, to help out. The issue became a crisis when Maff's hired experts said the main problem in containing the disease was delay between the call from the farmer and destruction of the animals. More vets were crucial. To ease their burden, army logistic teams were brought in to do their administration. The time between visiting a diseased animals and going on to the next outbreak has been shortened to 72 hours. Mr Blair pledged that the time between the first call and slaughter would be less than 24 hours. The second problem, which Maff blamed partly on farmers, was the time taken for valuations of animals before slaughter. Every farmer has a right under the Animal Health Act to have animals valued before being killed. On a farm with 2,000 assorted sheep, cattle and goats, that can take time. A farmer also has the right to choose his valuer and to appeal if he thinks the valuation is wrong, a process that could cost two days. The ministry has provided blanket valuations slightly more generous than the farmer could expect. It will cost the taxpayer millions. The third difficulty was getting the slaughter teams to the farms to kill hundreds of animals. Disposing of the carcasses brought most problems - and the loudest criticism from farmers, the NFU and the opposition. In the 1967 outbreak most bodies were buried, but modern environmental scruples about poisoning water supplies prevented that in many places. The sheer volume of animals meant massive pyres had to be build, rendering plants brought on line and the army brought in to bury 500,000 sheep in a mass grave in Cumbria. No one is now pretending the situation is under control, but the ministry seems at least to be catching up. The issue of whether to vaccinate is now the main focus of unrest. What's going on?

Then the countryside got by OK - quietly fattening the odd pig, shooting rabbits - with only a hazy notion about life in the Anderson shelters and the tube stations. Now London carries on as normal, while in the country it is just like a war.</p> <p>The mood veers suddenly between cheeriness and bouts of panic. Hard information is negligible. Rumours spread even quicker than the virus. Everyone knows someone who has heard about some scam or other. There is a universal contempt for authority, though much of the criticism is contradictory. Deep down, in a very British way, people want to do the right thing. Whatever that is.</p> <p>Wapping screams (and Farringdon Road whispers) that what Britain really, really needs is an immediate general election. In Herefordshire, the notion seems too bizarre to contemplate. There has been only one subject for discussion: foot and mouth. And yesterday, according to rumour, the first case was confirmed in our valley.</p> <p>If so, this is the fourth phase of the crisis. Phase one was fingers-crossed-and-pass-the-disinfectant. That ended last Tuesday when news came through that one local big-way farmer had the disease on one of his outposts elsewhere. They would thus be shooting and burning at once on his properties here.</p> <p>The news convulsed the neighbourhood. The school was shut down (on the very morning the Guardian said no schools were closed), to avoid the children being distressed by the gunfire. Straw defences were renewed and redoubled. Some farmers barricaded themselves in to their homes. Then of course there was a delay. And we moved slowly into phase three, which was altogether more fatalistic.</p> <p>There was a growing sense of pointlessness. We were surrounded by dots on the map; we could now see the fires; and everyone thought it was when, not whether. There were confirmed cases just over the mountain, only a few miles away as the crow flies, which is probably the relevant metaphor given what crows do to unburied carcasses. One neighbour has been losing hens to a fox, which conceivably - in clear breach of Maff guidelines - had not disinfected itself first. The customary trail of blood and feathers was spotted two farms away.</p> <p>The farmgate straw was becoming less and less convincing, and farmers began to sense that the ones who got the disease might well be the lucky ones. At least they get compensation. They save on the feed bill - higher than usual because of the late spring - and, with no animals to look after, might even consider shoving off to Tenerife for a week sometime soon, which for livestock farmers is normally unthinkable. The ones left behind see costs spiralling and income prospects at zero. Animals stuck the wrong side of a road have been dying in the snow. Nothing can go to market. The AI man (the artificial inseminator) is not allowed to call, so farmers without bulls will get no calves next year. Getting the disease could seem a better bet. \"We need a ministry of understanding,\" said one farmer's wife plaintively.</p> <p>You can argue, if you like, to what extent farmers have contributed to this tragedy, whether they are sentimental or callous about their animals; villains or victims. The truth of course is that they vary. But none of them constructed the crazed system of subsidies, designed to benefit the French peasantry of the 1950s, which has favoured the rich and the unscrupulous at the expense of the ordinary farmer, and the consumer. This feels now like the final crisis of British agriculture, as we have known it. It is hard to imagine any upshot other than a ruined countryside, producing less, dearer and worse food.</p> <p>Meantime, London is still in denial. Yesterday there was the Sun, backed by the chairman of the parliamentary Labour party (who represents the pastoralists of Hammersmith) saying that if the election is not held on May 3 (a full year early), \"it will cripple the tourist trade\". Well, la-di-dah. General Franco postponed Spanish elections for 40 years and Sun readers still went to the Costa Brava.</p> <p>We are supposed to believe that tourism hasn't already been crippled by ministers screaming at people to keep out of the countryside. All will be well provided Tony Blair stops trying to control foot and mouth, but instead spends a month on the road campaigning instead. Telling us how he has united the nation, no doubt.</p> <p>Just one question: if the election is on when the last ewe is killed by the last army bullet, will Alastair Campbell ring the BBC and demand that they ignore that item, and instead lead the bulletins with Labour's proposals for the glittering future of agriculture?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk\">matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/subsection/0,7370,463511,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a><br></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459872,00.html\">20.03.2001: Looking forward to easter, nervously</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html  \">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

      "body": "<p>The law lords are being asked to resolve a conflict between two fundamental rights this week: the right to a fair trial; and the right of victims in rape trials not to be further traumatised by defence lawyers publicly scrutinising their previous sexual history in intrusive detail. Defendant Y believes a new law, introduced only last December, breaches his right to a fair trial. He is accused of rape and wishes to introduce evidence which would show the jury that the complainant had willingly had sex with him in the previous week. The trial judge has ruled this inadmissible, under a new Criminal Evidence Act. He has adjourned the trial until higher courts decide whether the new rule contradicts the new human rights act, which guarantees fair trials. The appeal court ruled that it did, but it now goes before the law lords.</p> <p>The reason why the new rule was introduced was simple enough: the failure of judges to exercise tight control over the admissibility of earlier sexual history. It is now 25 years since a committee under high court judge Dame Rose Heilbron set out why a victim's sexual history was largely irrelevant in a rape trial but \"inimical to the fair trial of the essential issues\".

      "bodyText": "The law lords are being asked to resolve a conflict between two fundamental rights this week: the right to a fair trial; and the right of victims in rape trials not to be further traumatised by defence lawyers publicly scrutinising their previous sexual history in intrusive detail. Defendant Y believes a new law, introduced only last December, breaches his right to a fair trial. He is accused of rape and wishes to introduce evidence which would show the jury that the complainant had willingly had sex with him in the previous week. The trial judge has ruled this inadmissible, under a new Criminal Evidence Act. He has adjourned the trial until higher courts decide whether the new rule contradicts the new human rights act, which guarantees fair trials. The appeal court ruled that it did, but it now goes before the law lords. The reason why the new rule was introduced was simple enough: the failure of judges to exercise tight control over the admissibility of earlier sexual history. It is now 25 years since a committee under high court judge Dame Rose Heilbron set out why a victim's sexual history was largely irrelevant in a rape trial but \"inimical to the fair trial of the essential issues\". Discretion was extended to judges to exclude such evidence, but in three out of four cases where admissibility was sought, permission was granted. The law lords should re-read the Heilbron report - particularly as they are all men. They should also read the recent research of Professor Jennifer Temkin, documenting prejudice against rape victims even female barristers can hold, as well as showing how the old trick of discrediting victims in the eyes of jurors lives on.

The troops, already part of the K-For peacekeeping force in Kosovo, will patrol the border in the US south-eastern sector of the Serbian province of Kosovo.</p> <p>However, the MoD said last night that the battle group - containing what it calls the army's heaviest metal and constituting a weapon with psychological presence as well as firepower - could be deployed later in the German sector further south or other parts of Kosovo where reinforcements are needed.</p> <p>It is the first time Britain has formed a battle group with non-Nato Sweden, a neutral member of the EU.</p> <p>The decision to send reinforcements to southern Kosovo was announced in the Commons by Tony Blair. He also said that a specialist unit of 120 Royal Artillery personnel equipped with the Phoenix unmanned aerial reconnaissance vehicle would be deployed to the border region.</p> <p>The unit, based in Catterick, Yorkshire, is due to arrive in Kosovo in May, when it will join US, French and German unmanned drones already operating in the border region.</p> <p>The fact that the move was announced by the prime minister in his report back to MPs on last week's European summit in Stockholm gives it added political weight and significance.</p> <p>The UK-Swedish battle group will operate along a nine-mile stretch north of the Macedonian border town of Blace.

      "bodyText": "Britain will today send heavy tanks to the Macedonian border to deter ethnic Albanian extremists from crossing from Kosovo, the Ministry of Defence said yesterday. Challenger tanks, the strongest armour in the army, will be part of a UK-Swedish battle group of about 400 troops, the overwhelming majority of whom will be British. The combined force will include a squadron of the Royal Tank Regiment, equipped with 12 Challenger 2 tanks, and an infantry company from the Duke of Wellington's regiment with 13 Warrior armoured vehicles. The troops, already part of the K-For peacekeeping force in Kosovo, will patrol the border in the US south-eastern sector of the Serbian province of Kosovo. However, the MoD said last night that the battle group - containing what it calls the army's heaviest metal and constituting a weapon with psychological presence as well as firepower - could be deployed later in the German sector further south or other parts of Kosovo where reinforcements are needed. It is the first time Britain has formed a battle group with non-Nato Sweden, a neutral member of the EU. The decision to send reinforcements to southern Kosovo was announced in the Commons by Tony Blair. He also said that a specialist unit of 120 Royal Artillery personnel equipped with the Phoenix unmanned aerial reconnaissance vehicle would be deployed to the border region. The unit, based in Catterick, Yorkshire, is due to arrive in Kosovo in May, when it will join US, French and German unmanned drones already operating in the border region. The fact that the move was announced by the prime minister in his report back to MPs on last week's European summit in Stockholm gives it added political weight and significance. The UK-Swedish battle group will operate along a nine-mile stretch north of the Macedonian border town of Blace. It will replace a Polish-Ukrainian unit which was not equipped with surveillance or night vision equipment. Other Nato governments have placed strict limits on the movements of their troops in Kosovo, but are desperately concerned about an escalation in the Macedonian crisis. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, meanwhile, said the ethnic Albanian insurgents carrying out incursions from Kosovo into Macedonia must not be allowed to succeed. \"I now hope that the message will get across to the terrorists that there is no support anywhere in Europe for any attempt to re-draw boundaries in blood,\" he said after talks in London with Greek foreign minister, George Papandreou. \"We want to see the government of Macedonia succeed in its objective of building a plural, multi-ethnic society,\" said Mr Cook. But he said the response of the Macedonian government must be \"proportionate\" to the terrorist threat. Lord Robertson, the Nato secretary general, who returned to the capital, Skopje, yesterday, also urged restraint. \"The Macedonian government has regained the military high ground. Now they have to take the political high ground,\" he said. What's going on? The fighting in Macedonia explained Map: where is Tetovo? Talk about it Should Nato intervene?

The debate has been raging as to what the underlying causes are. It could be radiotherapy. It could also be cultural differences - that women choose to have different kinds of treatment or are not offered different kinds of treatment. This is a cause for concern. We would want all women to have equal access to the treatments that are best for them.\"</p> <p>The government's national cancer director, Mike Richards, did not deny the figures but stated that measures were being taken to make more radiotherapy available in hospitals. \"I am aware that radiotherapy services are very stretched,\" he said in a statement. \"We are tackling this in a number of ways. Over the next three years, funding from the new opportunities fund and the Department of Health will be used to buy 101 linear accelerators (machines to kill cancer cells with accurately delivered high doses of radiation).

This led to loss of dignity for older people on the wards and disorientation for those left waiting in accident and emergency departments. Mr Milburn will promise \"a more radical approach to rooting out age discrimination across the NHS\". A systematic audit of all NHS policies influencing older people's access to services will be carried out over the next six months with a view to eradicating discrimination. Each NHS trust and social services authority will be told to appoint an executive director to carry out this policy. Older people will be appointed to every patient forum to represent their point of view. There will also be surveys to compare the treatment of older people with renal failure, heart trouble and cancer to establish whether age is affecting doctors' clinical decisions. The government will not say older people should necessarily get the same treatment as younger patients. There may be reasons why a particular operation is more risky for an older patient. \"But decisions must always be taken on the basis of clinical need and ability to benefit. We are breaking down age barriers in the NHS,\" a Department of Health source said. Gordon Lishman, director general of Age Concern England, said the new framework would need support at local level. \u0095 People who are blind or partially sighted are left abandoned and confused in eye clinics, according to a report yesterday by the Royal National Institute for the Blind. It found 86% of patients received appointment letters from clinics in normal size print which they found difficult or impossible to read. Only 40% were told what their eye condition meant and how it would affect them.",

Driving out of Carlisle, beyond the roundabouts and small industrial units, you can hear cattle lowing and dragging their chains, and in the car park there are trucks full of bleating sheep arriving at a market that doesn't especially want them. Inside you cannot breathe for the smell of dung: farmers move around, shuffling papers, eating rolls and sausages, drinking coffee from Styrofoam cups. Some of them check advertising boards covered with details of machinery for sale, farm buildings for rent - the day-to-day evidence of farmers selling up. \"It could be any of us selling our tractor up there,\" an old man in a tweed cap muttered at me.</p> <p>The Tannoy crackled into life. \"The sale of five cattle is starting right now in ring number one,\" the voice said. A black heifer was padding around the ring, its hooves slipping in sawdust and shit, and the man in charge of the gate, whose overalls were similarly caked, regularly patted it on the rump to keep it moving. Farmers in wellington boots and green waxed jackets hung their arms over the bars taking notes. One or two looked more like City businessmen. The heifer was 19 months old and weighed 430kg. The bidding was quick and decisive: the beast went for 79p a kilo.</p> <p>\"If you were here in the prime beef ring six or seven years ago,\" the auctioneer said later, \"you would have seen the farmers getting about 120p per kilo. That is why so many are going out of business. Four years ago, young female sheep would be going for \u00a380-odd, and today they are averaging \u00a330.\"</p> <p>Back in his office, the auctioneer took out his book covering the last few years. \"Last week, bulls were averaging 82.7p per kilo. Three years ago . . .\" He riffled through the pages. \"Three years ago the average for bulls was 101.5p, and in October 1995, before BSE, the same bulls were fetching 134.2p. Think about that. There it is. Black and white. You can't argue with those figures. Hellish.\"</p> <p>Because of government regulations stemming from the BSE crisis, every cow in Britain now has a passport, which tells where and when it was born, and where it has been since. But despite the seriousness of the attempt to tackle BSE, and the relative healthiness (by EU standards) of the meat on sale here, no one abroad wants British beef any more. Peo ple are always sensitive about meat, and they find it difficult to forget bad news - a fact which is already turning the BSE, swine fever and foot and mouth crises into a full-blown catastrophe, especially in respect of European buyers.</p> <p>At the moment there are only two abattoirs that export beef. The market is dead. (Before 1996, British beef was generally considered the best in Europe.) Current EU proposals seem set to tackle overproduction by making subsidy payments relate to acreage rather than headcount. \"It will result in a reduction in livestock units,\" the auctioneer said, \"and if we don't have the units, it's hopeless for the whole community.\" The auctioneer was defending his own business, as he should, but why should taxpayers pay subsidies to farmers?</p> <p>The auctioneer's boss was more strident. \"The industry's going under,\" he said, \"and you'll notice something: the common agricultural policy works for the rest of the European Union, but it's not working for us.\"</p> <p>\"In what ways?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"Well, first, the animal welfare rules are more strongly applied here than anywhere, and in this, as in so many areas, British farmers find themselves not on a level playing field. We are not competing on equal ground. The weakness of the euro, with the subsidy payments coming in euros, is a killer;and as well as that, we are still being punished over the BSE crisis. There doesn't seem to be the appreciation in some quarters . . . \"</p> <p>\"You mean government?\"</p> <p>\"I'm not going to say that . . . Confidence has dropped. This is the largest mart in the UK, and what we see is that volumes are holding up, but costs have gone out of control: increased animal welfare, water usage, effluent handling and passports. Today alone we will be handling 1,500 passports for cattle.\"</p> <p>The boss dropped his middle finger ominously on to the table. \"Unless there is reinvestment the industry will . . . well, you check your crystal ball,\" he said. \"It is unbelievably serious in the rural community and I don't think people properly appreciate it. It's no longer a north/south divide we have in this country: it's a rural/urban divide. It's easy to work out: after 18 months or more of breeding and feeding and labour, a farmer today is walking home with \u00a3339.70 for a good heifer. Nothing.\" Five months after he said this, many of the farmers weren't even getting that. \"Nothing\" was the accurate figure; compensation the only hope.</p> <p>Climbing to Rakefoot Farm outside Keswick, you see nothing but hills and, in the distance, the lakes like patches of silver; teashops and heritage centres and Wordsworth's Walks serve as punctuation on the hills going brown in the afternoon. Will Cockbain was sitting in front of a black range in a cottage built in 1504. \"There are ghosts here,\" he said, \"but they're mostly quite friendly.\"</p> <p>Cockbain's father bought Rakefoot Farm in 1958, but his family has been working the land around Keswick for hundreds of years. \"There are more Cockbains in the local cemetery than anything else,\" he said, \"and they have always been sheep farmers. Sitting here with you now, I can remember the smell of bread coming from that range, years ago, when my grandmother was here.\"</p> <p>Cockbain has 1,100 Swaledale sheep and 35 suckler cows on the farm. \"Seven thousand pounds is a figure you often hear as an annual earning for full-time farmers round here,\" he said. \"Quite a few are on family credit - though not many will admit it. We farm 2,500 acres, of which we now own just 170, the rest being rented from five different landlords, including the National Trust. The bigger part of our income comes from subsidies we get for environmental work - keeping the stone walls and fences in order, maintaining stock-proof dykes, burning heather, off-wintering trees.\"</p> <p>\"Can't you make anything from the sheep?\" I asked. \"No,\" he said. \"We are selling livestock way below the cost of production. Subsidies were introduced in 1947 when there was rationing and food shortages, and the subsidies continued, along with guaranteed prices, and now even the subsidies aren't enough. We've got the lowest ewe premium price we've had for years. In hill farming the income is stuck and the environmental grants are stuck, too. Fuel prices are crippling us. We are in a job that doesn't pay well and we depend on our vehicles. We are responsible for keeping the landscape the way people say they are proud to have it - but who pays for it? The people down the road selling postcards of the Lake District are making much more than the farmers who keep the land so photogenic.\"</p> <p>Cockbain was the same size as the chair he was sitting in. Staring into the fire, he waggled his stocking-soled feet, and blew out his lips. \"I think Margaret Thatcher saw those guaranteed prices farmers were getting and just hated it,\" he said. \"And now, though it kills me, we may have to face something: there are too many sheep in the economy. Farmers go down to the market every other week and sell one sheep, and then they give 30 or 40 away. They're not worth anything. There are mass sheep graves everywhere now in the United Kingdom.\" Cockbain laughed and drank his tea. \"It's only those with an inbuilt capacity for pain that can stand the farming life nowadays,\" he said. \"I like the life, but you can't keep liking it when you're running against the bank, when things are getting out of control in ways you never dreamed of, relationships falling apart, everything.\"</p> <p>On the walls of Cockbain's farm there are dozens of rosettes for prize-winning sheep. A picture of Cockbain's son holding a prize ram hangs beside a grandfather clock made by Simpson of Cockermouth, and an old barometer pointing to Rain. \"This is a farming community from way back,\" Cockbain said, \"but they're all getting too old now. Young men with trained dogs are a rarity, and hill farming, of all kinds, needs young legs. We've lost a whole generation to farming. My boys are hanging in there for now, but with, what, \u00a327,000 last year between four men, who could blame them for disappearing?\"</p> <p>Another day, in the tiny kitchen of a hill farm above Bewcastle, 800ft above sea level, a little girl called Louise Carruthers walked to the sink in her blue parka, carrying a jug of water. She smiles and looks like a girl in a Vermeer. \"I've made nothing this year,\" her father, Brian, told me. \"I'm on family credit and dependent on family allowance to get from week to week. And I'm working from daylight to dark. I'm trying to encourage my boy not to go into this. One of my friends gave up and now he's working on a building site earning \u00a3280 a week.\"</p> <p>Carruthers' farm is a confusion of mist and rotting leaves. When I arrived, he slammed the door of his Land Rover shut and tasted the air. \"Last year we were buying fuel at 11p a litre, and now it's 22p, and has even been up as high recently as 27p.\"</p> <p>Inside the cottage, there is a pair of Massey Ferguson overalls hanging above the Aga and a waxcloth on the table. \"You know all the reasons for this,\" he said, \"but people ought to look at the supermarkets: they are really taking the piss. They talk about partnerships and all that but they have the farmers at each other's throats. Forget the landscape, forget the culture, and forget traditions, forget the efforts being made by farmers to produce good quality stuff - most supermarkets will buy from wherever they get the best deal. They don't support the British farmer, although it suits them to say they do. They squeeze everyone.\"</p> <p>Couldn't Carruthers diversify? \"Oh aye,\" he said, \"they're always talking about diversify. Into what? It's hard to believe the way people plough nowadays. You can't buy into that now, not with those giant agribusiness people, who buy everything and turn it arable. Tenant farmers are no match for those big businesses. Diversify? How else? It's heavy clay land up here, it's wet, there's no tourism, no ponies, no golf.\"</p> <p>\"So what do farmers do who can't cope?\" I asked. \"Commit suicide,\" he replied, \"or drive a dumper.\"</p> <p>Carruthers is 42 years old. He is separated with two children. His wife left him after beginning an affair with a man she met in the office where she worked. He keeps all his cattle passports in a tin and at one point he held a passport up and said to Louise: \"It looks a bit like our family allowance book.\" They had been watching Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? the previous night, \"and this guy lost \u00a3125,000 on a question we knew the answer to. It was amazing, wasn't it, Louise?\"</p> <p>Out in the yard I saw some of Carruthers' Galloway cows. It takes three years for these famous animals to mature, but under the new BSE regulations cows have to be slaughtered before their 30th month. Brian patted one of the cows on the way past. \"It's going to be a nightmare if they let farming go the same way as mining,\" he said, \"but still, we all vote Conservative up here. The Tories were much better to us.\"</p> <p>You could see the Solway Firth 20 miles away. There it was: Scotland and England balanced along a line of blue mist. And it felt as if there was a freeze coming down. Carruthers nudged me with his arm as I left, and he laughed, looking into the wild, unpeopled hills. \"If you find me a new wife make sure she's an accountant,\" he said.</p> <p>\u00a9 Andrew O'Hagan.

He keeps all his cattle passports in a tin and at one point he held a passport up and said to Louise: \"It looks a bit like our family allowance book.\" They had been watching Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? the previous night, \"and this guy lost \u00a3125,000 on a question we knew the answer to. It was amazing, wasn't it, Louise?\" Out in the yard I saw some of Carruthers' Galloway cows. It takes three years for these famous animals to mature, but under the new BSE regulations cows have to be slaughtered before their 30th month. Brian patted one of the cows on the way past. \"It's going to be a nightmare if they let farming go the same way as mining,\" he said, \"but still, we all vote Conservative up here. The Tories were much better to us.\" You could see the Solway Firth 20 miles away. There it was: Scotland and England balanced along a line of blue mist. And it felt as if there was a freeze coming down. Carruthers nudged me with his arm as I left, and he laughed, looking into the wild, unpeopled hills. \"If you find me a new wife make sure she's an accountant,\" he said. \u00a9 Andrew O'Hagan.

He points out that the town's port at Immingham handles 50m tonnes of cargo a year, making it the country's largest and the most profitable for Associated British Ports.

Behind scores of empty moorings on the Old Pontoon, among the boarded up boathouses and derelict shops that once serviced the bustling fishing harbour, news that Grimsby is the most profitable town in Britain is not well met at TC's members-only bar, a regular haunt for the town's washed-up trawlermen. </p> <p>\"You're joking, aren't you?\" says one. \"Take a look around.\" Some howl with laughter at the news, but most look furious and say nothing. Frank, an elderly man who has been playing cribbage, puts down his hand and says: \"I think you'd better leave now, son.\" </p> <p>In the 1950s, Grimsby harboured 279 vessels, employed 3,371 registered fishermen, and claimed to be the world's largest fishing port. The loss of a diplomatic row with Iceland over fishing rights and declining North Sea stocks have since decimated the fleet. </p> <p>Today, drivers approaching Grimsby along the A180 are quickly struck by the scale of industry in the town as grass meadows give way to fields of Volkswagen cars shipped in from Europe, and mountains of coal and ore destined for the steelworks at nearby Scunthorpe.

Next to them, two oil refineries, owned by Lindsey Oil and Conoco. </p> <p>The impressive scale of industry is accompanied by an eerie absence of manpower. Even on busy working days, as the chemical plants, refineries and cargo docks are doing millions of pounds worth of trade, little human activity is visible in Grimsby's industrial districts. </p> <p>\"We have high volume, capital intensive industries here, but they tend to use just a small number of people,\" says Mr Hinchliffe. \"For example, we have calculated that for every \u00a31m of investment in the chemical industry, we get just one job created.

Naturally, we are very pleased to have the plants and the jobs but they are not quite as embedded in the area as they would be if the headquarters were here.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, the town's workforce is left to make a living processing imported fish into frozen meals - one of the few labour intensive industries in the town. Carol Russell, who used to earn \u00a33.50 an hour processing fish into shaped fish meals for export to French supermarkets before becoming a taxi driver, insists Dun &amp; Bradstreet's research must be mistaken. </p> <p>Driving around the harbour area, she points out the areas where, as a child, she would go with her father to collect fish for the dinner table. \"Look at it. It's a ghost town now,\" she says. \"There was a time when nobody in Grimsby ever paid for their fish - there was always someone in the family working on the docks who would throw you some fish for your dinner. Nowadays, most people in this town can't even afford to buy wet fish - unless it's off the back of a lorry.\" </p> <p>Like Ms Russell, many Grimbarians have turned to the food processing factories - owned by Heinz, Young's, Bluecrest and Birds Eye, among others - for jobs. </p> <p>Agnar Fridricksson, managing director of Icelandic-owned firm Coldwater, which makes convenience seafood including filet-o-fish for all McDonald's restaurants in the UK, says the town's fishing heritage and transport links makes it an ideal location for food processors. </p> <p><strong> 'They know fish'</strong><br> </p> <p> \"People in Grimsby are used to fish, they know fish, they know how to handle fish,\" he says. \"Grimsby has transformed admirably from being dependent on local fisheries to becoming a major secondary processing location, with its service industries and transport links.\" </p> <p>More recently, the factories have been diversifying away from seafood, and the smells of beef dinners, pizzas and oriental meals are now commonplace.

Last May, the British government agreed to remove the anomaly but it is only now they are moving on it. \"It's a welcome move for these men and their families but it is only a small step and much, much more is needed. There are lots of people in the same position.\" The timing of the gesture is highly symbolic, given the importance of prisoners' rights to republicans, particularly in this 20th anniversary year of the death of 10 hunger strikers, who were trying to gain political status in the Maze, Co Antrim, in 1981. With the IRA's recent re-engagement with General John de Chastelain's disarmament body, it could be read as part of a carefully choreographed sequence of moves to try to get the provisionals to decommission their weapons. But unionists will be furious at what they will view as virtually an official pardon for murderers and bombers. One of the freed men is Liam Averill, a member of the Irish National Liberation Army, convicted of two murders in 1994. He made an audacious escape dressed as a woman during a Christmas party on December 10 1997. The others are all thought to be IRA men. One, Gerard Sloan, was one of eight men who shot their way out of Belfast's Crumlin Road jail in 1981. Four fellow gang members, Angelo Fusco, Robert Campbell, Patrick Magee and Anthony Sloan, were effectively pardoned in December. The four were captured in the Irish Republic and served jail terms there but did not qualify for early release because they had served less than two years in prison in Northern Ireland. At the time, the Ulster Unionist deputy leader, John Taylor, condemned the decision to free them as deplorable and far too liberal. Five of those freed in this latest gesture are Seamy Campbell, Gerard Fryers, James Clarke, Dermott McNally and Seamus Clarke, brother of Terence \"Cleeky\" Clarke, Gerry Adams's minder and friend, who died of cancer last year. They escaped during the mass breakout from the high-security Maze jail in 1983, when 38 inmates, armed with guns and knives, seized a lorry in the prison compound. One prison officer was killed and another seriously wounded. Nineteen prisoners were quickly recaptured but the rest got away. By 1992, five had been recaptured, three killed in ambushes and 11 were still on the run. The other man involved in the apparent amnesty is Patrick McIntyre, who failed to return from home leave in 1986.",

The time comes when there's little left to say about a disaster that's immutable. Already beginning to be bored with another piece about foot and mouth? I guess so. But that's the point. The boredom threshold is a political fact, as an apathetic nation is lured towards an election it neither very badly wants nor very badly doesn't want, during a calamity that many people, in their shoulder- shrugging British way, learn to live with.</p> <p>As decision day approaches for Tony Blair, this has to be a big part of his judgment. What will the voters really care about? Will they rage at him for going too soon, if he sticks with the four-year blueprint ending on May 3? Or soon forget about the horrors they now see on the screen every night? My bet is that he'll settle for a cautious version of the second scenario. Long afraid of apathy's low turn-out, he can now turn apathy to advantage. June 7 would be a good moment to split the difference.</p> <p>When it happens, this will be an election far removed from 1997 in everything except the approximate result. Staring at these empty fields, and smoking pyres, and slaughterhouse soldiers, not to mention failing trains, and rundown hospitals, and struggling schools, voters need a vast reservoir of tolerance to prevent them rising up in rage to punish the nearest available prime minister. But apathy, and William Hague, will not find them wanting.</p> <p>Apathy will ensure, first, that foot and mouth disappears from most screens within a week of the election starting. Already bored with it, the majority will soon forget. The campaign will take over all the headlines, because that's what all the parties want and all the media will gladly respond to. Part of the reason why foot and mouth has eaten into the national mood is because there are no pictures to knock it off the bulletins. A campaign, even one that has a hard job making people care, will soon change that.</p> <p>It needs to be preceded by the impression that the government is at last in charge. That may not happen by May, but will certainly have climaxed before the autumn. In retrospect it's clear that ministers weren't in charge from the beginning. They got the urgency of the thing all wrong. For a few days, Hague at last managed to make the government and not the opposition the target of big questions. But field marshal Blair has handed over command to the brigadiers, who can be heard barking over the air-waves with unagricultural authority.</p> <p>Though the cases will keep coming for many months after the curve declines, they're still seen more as acts of God and pigswill than the results of political failure. There is political failure, in the rundown of vet services for farm surveillance, but as with so much else the blame is divided: the Thatcher plague on the public sector, as yet unrectified by her successor.</p> <p>Meanwhile, time passes. F and M, from being a catastrophic novelty, becomes part of almost normal life. Other realities move up alongside it. It's specious to pretend, as the spinners now do, that the whole world is looking to British elections being held in May for proof that the country is still part of the planet. But governing is paralysed by strategic indecision, the blight of pre-election phases in all countries everywhere, regardless of whether they're discretionary or fixed-term. Already, it seems to this observer, the case for indefinite delay is trumped by the need to settle things. What has changed, since the days when imminent elections seemed an affront to democracy, is the discovery that there's no likely time when they would seem much less of one.</p> <p>These preliminaries should certainly be expected to change the nature of the campaign. It will not be joyful, and is less likely than it was to be casually venomous. The original plans of both main sides were firing up to emphasise anger and contempt. They were going to make it as bitterly personal as they could find the words for: the Tories because they had nothing else to say except how exquisitely they abominated Tony Blair, Labour because it needed something to stimulate the nightmares of supporters and drive them to polls in which they may otherwise have lost faith.</p> <p>No doubt there will still be some of this. But the sombre context indicates a different presentation, especially by the government. At a time when crisis is still a word in voters' consciousness, ministers will want to emphasise their gravitas, their experience, their dutiful sense of responsibility, even, lord help us, their competence. Instead of parading their bright-eyed triumphs, they'll be offering themselves as solid custodians of the future, the safest pair of hands to deal with future pigswill visitations or any other national crises.</p> <p>On the face of it, this should be a pretty incredible claim. Standing back from our politics, foreign visitors are struck by the terrible state of things here. These may all have come in a rush, and, deep down, the Blair administration may have laid the ground for massive improvements at some time later. But with the fields stripped bare and the railways in chaos and doctors gloom-mongering the NHS and police numbers in decline and sundry ministers unable to give an honest account of their public lives, the election ought to be lost. That it isn't going to be is tribute to the happy congruence between Blairism's need to be judged in the long term not the short, and the voters' apathetic disbelief in the possibility of anything better. A dismal verdict, I'm afraid. But the most plausible one available.</p> <p>The best thing to do now would be to announce that all elections, the local and the general, will be held on June 7. This would pay necessary respect to those people, especially in rural areas, who would be justifiably affronted by a rush to the polls, or by local elections that can be changed by statute without terrible insult to anyone. A month is a long delay, and time enough for man to gain some control over the contagion that is decimating the herds. The prime minister would be seen to do his governing duty, at some cost to his political plans. The first half of the allotted period would be spent showing he had got his priorities right.</p> <p>The second half could then see a campaign that wasn't distracted by charges of opportunism. The balance of opportunism has in any case swung round. It's not at all clear, after all that's happened, that going early is going best for the Labour vote. But all that's happened means that Britain needs a government in place, settled enough to confront the crisis that may be more serious than foot and mouth: a downturn in European economies that could yet be our really fearsome autumn rendering.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/subsection/0,7370,463511,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a><br></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459872,00.html\">20.03.2001: Looking forward to easter, nervously</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html  \">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

Daily Telegraph With strong public support, a huge majority and more than a year to run, Mr Blair does not need a new mandate: he needs to do his job. Daily Express When the Queen and her 10th prime minister since Churchill meet, Mr Blair would be well advised to be honest, listen and take heed of his sovereign's warnings. The Times To suggest that the largely fictious hurly burly of the election campaign could add measurably to the risk of spreading the disease is nonsense. The sensibilities of farmers should be treated with respect, but that should not include pointless gestures. Financial Times Blair is probably still tempted to press ahead with the election. That would be the better course. The Guardian Mr Blair should nerve himself for the wave of abuse that will surely follow, but do the brave thing all the same. Call it for May 3. The Independent That a general election was held in 1945 when the nation was still at war with Japan ... suggests that the democratic arguments against an election on May 3 remain flimsy.",

Even the prime minister suffered the indignity of having the food on his plane incinerated once he had touched down for the European summit in Stockholm over the weekend. The Swedes did not want Tony Blair importing foot and mouth into their pristine country, thank you very much. One family who had moved recently from England to Ireland had to get their British number plates replaced: they had been taunted and harassed as they drove around, reviled as carriers of the plague.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, it's not surprising that people are casting around for ideas and solutions. The Conservatives want Mr Blair to appoint a war cabinet to combat the disease; the PM responds that it's hard to see what good \"another committee\" will do. He wants to focus instead on cutting the time between spotting F&amp;M and destroying the animals carrying it.

Once the immediate crisis has eventually passed, and that moment may take months to come, we shall have to look long and hard at British agriculture and what really ails it.</p> <p>Of course, the list we could draw up is long. Supermarkets' demand for cheap food has forced farmers into intensive methods even they regret. The common agricultural policy, which subsidises over-production, has been crying out for reform for too long. The way food is distributed has created insanities: a lettuce grown in Cornwall may be transported by road to Bristol to be wrapped in plastic, only to be driven back to Cornwall again. There is so much madness in our food production that the government could dedicate all of its second term to overhauling it and still not be finished.</p> <p>But there is a simple start it should make - by abolishing the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, or Maff. It has become an arm of the food industry, the captive of the retailers and agri-businesses rather than the champion of the consumer and small farmer. It looks out for the big supermarket chains, often passing their demands on to already pressed farmers - forcing them into practices that are wholly unsustainable.</p> <p>The remedy is clear. Maff should make way for a department of food and rural affairs. Such a ministry could look out for the quality of what we eat, liaising with the Department of Health and a muscled food safety authority, while genuinely fighting for those farmers who try to produce food of quality and by sustainable methods.

Corus insisted yesterday it was committed to fulfilling its contractual obligations to consult over the future.</p> <p>A Corus spokesman admitted he had seen media leaks on the content of the ISTC plan, adding: \"We have not seen anything yet to change our mind [about closures].\"</p> <p>The union scheme involves funding the existing level of workforce and steel-making capacity with a mixture of public money and cash from private sources, including Corus, for about 12 months in the expectation the market will show an upturn.</p> <p>Corus rejects accusations from critics, including prime minister Tony Blair, that it is acting with of only short-term interests in mind.</p> <p>A steel group spokesman said: \"We have looked at the long term prospects for the markets - particularly in the UK - and we do not foresee any turnaround, with the UK manufacturers sourcing more and more products from abroad.\"</p> <p>He said any union plan would have to include proposals for dealing with this.</p> <p>Corus said earlier this month that losses from carbon steel were still running at \u00a31m a day although there were signs of some prices edging up.</p> <p>Corus wants to cut about 20% of its capacity in Britain but keep substantial volumes in Scunthorpe, Teesside and the Sheffield area.</p> <p>The ISTC believes its plan will be viable even if fails to gain the backing of industry secretary Stephen Byers.

      "bodyText": "Union bosses today will authorise a ballot on industrial action at Llanwern and Teesside steel plants if, as expected, Corus rejects their rescue plan and proceeds with plant closures and 6,000 redundancies. The ISTC steel union has already held talks with Dutch counterparts to ensure Corus facilities in the Netherlands are not used to offset production shortages in Britain. Last night Michael Leahy, general secretary of the ISTC, was locked in talks to secure final government support for a \u00a3100m rescue package to be placed before Corus chairman Sir Brian Moffatt this morning. There is growing certainty within the union, however, that the steel group has already decided to reject the proposals. Corus insisted yesterday it was committed to fulfilling its contractual obligations to consult over the future. A Corus spokesman admitted he had seen media leaks on the content of the ISTC plan, adding: \"We have not seen anything yet to change our mind [about closures].\" The union scheme involves funding the existing level of workforce and steel-making capacity with a mixture of public money and cash from private sources, including Corus, for about 12 months in the expectation the market will show an upturn. Corus rejects accusations from critics, including prime minister Tony Blair, that it is acting with of only short-term interests in mind. A steel group spokesman said: \"We have looked at the long term prospects for the markets - particularly in the UK - and we do not foresee any turnaround, with the UK manufacturers sourcing more and more products from abroad.\" He said any union plan would have to include proposals for dealing with this. Corus said earlier this month that losses from carbon steel were still running at \u00a31m a day although there were signs of some prices edging up. Corus wants to cut about 20% of its capacity in Britain but keep substantial volumes in Scunthorpe, Teesside and the Sheffield area. The ISTC believes its plan will be viable even if fails to gain the backing of industry secretary Stephen Byers. It has put together a contingency scheme building on the money it has already secured through the European Union and the Welsh Assembly. The ISTC has become alarmed at the last minute wavering from civil servants from the Department of Trade and Industry. A host of arguments, including the legality of the financial package using public money, have been used to question whether the government should put its weight behind the union scheme. Mr Leahy has warned that the union believes in the force of argument but if this is rejected then it is prepared \"to use the arguments of force\". The union is one of the more conservative in the labour movement but is also one of the richest. With \u00a320m of liquid assets, it is well equipped for a drawn-out battle with Corus. A source close to the union said: \"They [the ISTC] do not want to damage the steel industry but believe Corus should not get away with this. They know they can damage Corus by just withdrawing key personnel from each plant.\"",

It seems intrinsically unfair that those living in certain areas should have a poorer quality of service in the 21st century,\" he said at a lecture for the pharmaceutical firm, Pharmacia, for whom he is a consultant. </p> <p>Elaborating yesterday, he said there were reasons why there might be some small variation from one hospital to another. \"There are always some women who prefer to have a mastectomy. In others it may be that a mastectomy would be slightly better. But regional variations shouldn't be more than a few per cent.\" </p> <p>Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, urged that there should be a much fuller audit of the treatment and outcomes for women with breast cancer. \"There are variations,\" she said. \"There are variations in survival rates. The debate has been raging as to what the underlying causes are. It could be radiotherapy. It could also be cultural differences - that women choose to have different kinds of treatment or are not offered different kinds of treatment. This is a cause for concern. We would want all women to have equal access to the treatments that are best for them.\" </p> <p>The government's national cancer director, Mike Richards, did not deny the figures but stated that measures were being taken to make more radiotherapy available in hospitals. \"I am aware that radiotherapy services are very stretched,\" he said in a statement. \"We are tackling this in a number of ways. Over the next three years, funding from the new opportunities fund and the Department of Health will be used to buy 101 linear accelerators (machines to kill cancer cells with accurately delivered high doses of radiation).

      "bodyText": "Carlton and Granada are to tackle consumer confusion and apathy about digital TV by launching an on-air campaign promoting the take-up of the technology next week. The initiative comes just days after a Consumers Association study found 32% of respondents said they would never get digital TV and nearly 50% said they would only watch free-to-air digital channels after analogue switch-off. The TV industry, government and equipment manufacturers have been talking for the past year about a public information campaign, to deal with consumer confusion about digital TV and help drive take-up of the technology. But the two ITV companies are to take the lead and run a promotional campaign from next week, highlighting the difference between analogue and digital TV sets in the run-up to Easter when sales of TV sets usually pick up. The campaign will guide consumers towards sets with the Kitemark-style digital video broadcasting label, which is to be introduced from April as part of an initiative spearheaded by Department of Trade and Industry e-minister Patricia Hewitt. It will run across the 10 ITV franchises owned by the two companies, including LWT and Carlton in London, Carlton Central, Yorkshire, Granada, Anglia, Meridian and HTV. The promo has been produced by ONdigital, the digital terrestrial pay-TV operator jointly owned by Granada and Carlton. But a source involved in the project stressed the campaign was a generic one promoting digital TV, not the ONdigital platform in particular. \"The promo doesn't even mention ONdigital,\" the insider said. \"We believe there's a need to explain the difference between a digital TV and an analogue TV, so the digital message is clear.\" The promotion will also feature the on-screen logos for all 10 free-to-air digital services, including ITV2 and BBC Choice. Carlton and Granada's campaign has the backing of the DTI and the Digital TV group, an umbrella body representing broadcasters, retailers and equipment manufacturers, according to the source. But the campaign and ONdigital's involvement in it is not likely to be greeted with much enthusiasm by digital satellite broadcaster BSkyB. BSkyB insiders have argued that any campaign encouraging people to buy digital TV sets is effectively promoting rival terrestrial pay-TV platform ONdigital by the back door.

There is evidence, for instance, to support the story that Christ sweated blood on the cross. Evidence from the US shows it could have been a medical condition. </p> <p>\"There are more than 100 reported cases of people under extreme pressure who know they're going to die, on their way to the gallows or the gas chamber, they're sweating blood,\" Mr Bragard said. \"We looked at the scientific and archaeological evidence for the stories in the gospels.\" </p> <p>While the miracles told in the gospels were not explored (\"They are a matter of faith, you either believe them or you don't,\" said Mr Bragard), the series tackles a number of thorny issues. It suggests, for example, that Judas may not deserve the reputation conferred upon him by history. A re-examination of the original Greek versions of the gospels reveals that the expression translated as \"betrayed\" actually has a more anodyne meaning: Jesus was \"handed over\" to the authorities rather than \"turned in\". </p> <p>Judas Iscariot, for his 30 pieces of silver, may simply have believed he was arranging a meeting between Pontius Pilate and Christ - whose natural instinct was to confront authority. \"History has recorded Judas as the betrayer, and history may have got it wrong,\" Mr Bragard said. </p> <p>The series uses intricate computer graphics to reconstruct the buildings of Bethlehem, Jerusalem and Nazareth, showing the cities as they would have looked to contemporaries of Christ. The programme also attempts to give an impression of Christ's youth: a period almost totally ignored by the gospels. </p> <p>The series presenter, the BBC's former Middle East correspondent Jeremy Bowen, hopes the series will challenge traditional beliefs on all sides of the debate. \"I'm not a religious person, but this series is not about belief, it's about fact,\" he said. Before embarking upon the project, he said, he had never conceived that it could be possible to understand the existence of Jesus as an activist and hero without believing in God. </p> <p>\"I'm very sceptical about religion and my instinct was to disprove a lot of this stuff. But it simply can't be dismissed. I don't think you can deny that there was this person called Jesus - he was a hero, he did have a following.\" </p> <p>He said the computer-generated image of Christ was impressive: \"He was a Middle Eastern Jew.

      "body": "<p>Downwind, there was a smell like diarrhoea and clotted blood. A block of more than 100 decomposing sheep thumped from a dumper truck into a pit. Limbs flapping, the yellowed carcasses slid fast, because they were turning to liquid slime. They left a trail of blood and clumps of rotting fleece on the metal container.</p> <p>The death smell, more pungent than manure, is now common around Cumbria. It is known as \"the honk\". People gag on it but are resigned to it. A quarter of a mile from Britain's first foot and mouth burial site yesterday, there was laundry drying on lines. It would have to be washed again.</p> <p>Great Orton airfield, near Carlisle, is now known as \"the killing fields\". Long abandoned by the Royal Air Force, it was already bleak and grey. By the end of this week, there will be 2km of mass graves there. About 20 trenches, four metres deep and 150 metres long, will hold half a million carcasses.</p> <p>Yesterday 7,500 dead sheep made the fast slide into the pits, were drenched in lime then covered over almost immediately by mountains of excavated mud. The thud of landing carcasses was barely audible over the beeps of digging machinery churning out more burial pits. At least 10,000 carcasses will be dumped in the trenches tomorrow; after that 20,000 a day will be buried. Tomorrow, they will start to bring healthy animals here; they will be lined up, killed humanely and tipped into the pits. With 240 cases in Cumbria, more than one third of the national total, half a million carcasses, stand to be buried here.</p> <p>At the burial pit, Major Guy Richardson, said: \"It is a colossal operation which involves a huge team effort and we are moving things forward. People are just getting on with the job. If people sat back and had time to themselves, they would think. But everyone is knuckling down. We do not want to be complacent, we want to keep the momentum up.\"</p> <p>Maj Richardson said the trenches were being built as needed, to avoid the risk of empty pits filling with rain. Carcasses were being dumped at one end of a trench while bulldozers still worked at the other end.</p> <p>Twenty-seven leak-proof containers on articulated lorries carried the diseased carcasses under sealed tarpaulins, through a neat-lawned village to the site.</p> <p>Today 25 more containers will arrive, their odour seeping out. The only touch of humanity was the decoration in the truckers' cabs - leopard skin seats and curtain tassels. Elsewhere, contractors waded across straw fortresses in baggy protective suits, hard hats and face masks.</p> <p>A quarter of a mile down the straw-lined lanes is the village of Great Orton, population 235. It has two dairy farms and three hobby farms; all animals are disease-free but due for slaughter because they lie in the 3km buffer zone.</p> <p>At the Wellington pub, the landlady, Liz Currie, said disinfectant was ruining the carpet, and foot and mouth had killed trade. In the corner sat a group of French journalists making calls to Paris about the scale of the disaster.</p> <p>Ms Currie said: \"It has been drastic. The darts matches have been cancelled, plus the old people's activities. I have spent six months learning my lines for the panto, Cinderella, now that has been cancelled. It has killed the village.\"</p> <p>At the butcher's shop, which doubles as a post office, the owner, James Mulholland, said business was down by 25%. His son has 15 pedigree cows landlocked in a field 400 metres from the pit. \"The mass burial has to be done and that is all there is to it,\" he said.</p> <p>While the first carcasses were heaved into the pit, the minister of agricul ture, Nick Brown, flew from London to meet farmers and ministry officials in a Carlisle pub. Outside the Auctioneer drinking house, he jumped out of his car to calls of \"murderer\" and jumped back in two hours later to calls of \"you bastard.\" Around 10 farmers, gardeners and riding instructors had gathered, but he ignored them.</p> <p>After the meeting Mr Brown denied that the government had run out of answers to the question of foot and mouth. \"Just because it is a difficult situation, that doesn't mean we don't have answers to it,\" he said. Asked if the disease was out of control, he said: \"No, the policies for control and containment are the right ones.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We have already disposed of more animals in this disease outbreak than in the 1967 outbreak. There has been an enormous amount of work done already.\"</p> <p>He called for the time from reporting symptoms of the disease to slaughter to be improved, and asked vets worldwide to come and help. He then travelled to Devon to give farmers there the same message.</p> <p>But Steve Heaten, a local National Farmers' Union leader, said of the meeting: \"Frustration is the word. If I had any hair to pull out, I would have pulled it out.\"</p> <p>He said promises made by Tony Blair in his rushed visit to Carlisle last week had not yet been delivered. In particular, Carlisle abattoir should be opened to slaughter sheep in the 3km firebreak zone con currently with the burial site at Great Orton.

      "bodyText": "Downwind, there was a smell like diarrhoea and clotted blood. A block of more than 100 decomposing sheep thumped from a dumper truck into a pit. Limbs flapping, the yellowed carcasses slid fast, because they were turning to liquid slime. They left a trail of blood and clumps of rotting fleece on the metal container. The death smell, more pungent than manure, is now common around Cumbria. It is known as \"the honk\". People gag on it but are resigned to it. A quarter of a mile from Britain's first foot and mouth burial site yesterday, there was laundry drying on lines. It would have to be washed again. Great Orton airfield, near Carlisle, is now known as \"the killing fields\". Long abandoned by the Royal Air Force, it was already bleak and grey. By the end of this week, there will be 2km of mass graves there. About 20 trenches, four metres deep and 150 metres long, will hold half a million carcasses. Yesterday 7,500 dead sheep made the fast slide into the pits, were drenched in lime then covered over almost immediately by mountains of excavated mud. The thud of landing carcasses was barely audible over the beeps of digging machinery churning out more burial pits. At least 10,000 carcasses will be dumped in the trenches tomorrow; after that 20,000 a day will be buried. Tomorrow, they will start to bring healthy animals here; they will be lined up, killed humanely and tipped into the pits. With 240 cases in Cumbria, more than one third of the national total, half a million carcasses, stand to be buried here. At the burial pit, Major Guy Richardson, said: \"It is a colossal operation which involves a huge team effort and we are moving things forward. People are just getting on with the job. If people sat back and had time to themselves, they would think. But everyone is knuckling down. We do not want to be complacent, we want to keep the momentum up.\" Maj Richardson said the trenches were being built as needed, to avoid the risk of empty pits filling with rain. Carcasses were being dumped at one end of a trench while bulldozers still worked at the other end. Twenty-seven leak-proof containers on articulated lorries carried the diseased carcasses under sealed tarpaulins, through a neat-lawned village to the site. Today 25 more containers will arrive, their odour seeping out. The only touch of humanity was the decoration in the truckers' cabs - leopard skin seats and curtain tassels. Elsewhere, contractors waded across straw fortresses in baggy protective suits, hard hats and face masks. A quarter of a mile down the straw-lined lanes is the village of Great Orton, population 235. It has two dairy farms and three hobby farms; all animals are disease-free but due for slaughter because they lie in the 3km buffer zone. At the Wellington pub, the landlady, Liz Currie, said disinfectant was ruining the carpet, and foot and mouth had killed trade. In the corner sat a group of French journalists making calls to Paris about the scale of the disaster. Ms Currie said: \"It has been drastic. The darts matches have been cancelled, plus the old people's activities. I have spent six months learning my lines for the panto, Cinderella, now that has been cancelled. It has killed the village.\" At the butcher's shop, which doubles as a post office, the owner, James Mulholland, said business was down by 25%. His son has 15 pedigree cows landlocked in a field 400 metres from the pit. \"The mass burial has to be done and that is all there is to it,\" he said. While the first carcasses were heaved into the pit, the minister of agricul ture, Nick Brown, flew from London to meet farmers and ministry officials in a Carlisle pub. Outside the Auctioneer drinking house, he jumped out of his car to calls of \"murderer\" and jumped back in two hours later to calls of \"you bastard.\" Around 10 farmers, gardeners and riding instructors had gathered, but he ignored them. After the meeting Mr Brown denied that the government had run out of answers to the question of foot and mouth. \"Just because it is a difficult situation, that doesn't mean we don't have answers to it,\" he said. Asked if the disease was out of control, he said: \"No, the policies for control and containment are the right ones.\" He added: \"We have already disposed of more animals in this disease outbreak than in the 1967 outbreak. There has been an enormous amount of work done already.\" He called for the time from reporting symptoms of the disease to slaughter to be improved, and asked vets worldwide to come and help. He then travelled to Devon to give farmers there the same message. But Steve Heaten, a local National Farmers' Union leader, said of the meeting: \"Frustration is the word. If I had any hair to pull out, I would have pulled it out.\" He said promises made by Tony Blair in his rushed visit to Carlisle last week had not yet been delivered. In particular, Carlisle abattoir should be opened to slaughter sheep in the 3km firebreak zone con currently with the burial site at Great Orton. Mr Heaten said the process of diagnosis and confirmation of the disease on farms urgently needed to be speeded up. Back at the airfield, Brigadier Alex Birtwhistle, who is in charge of the operation, said the army was looking at five further sites in Cumbria for the mass burial. Jim Charters, 69, from nearby Kirkbampton, said: \"I am glad that they have finally got their fingers out and got going with this. It has all happened very, very slowly to start with. I am not opposed to them putting the dead animals there. But I hope they keep a very close eye on it and take soil samples from the fields around for a few years to come.\" What's going on?

      "body": "<p>Contaminated meat smuggled into Britain will be highlighted today by the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, as the most likely source of Britain's foot and mouth epidemic.</p> <p>A damning official account of the likely source of the outbreak will claim that pigs were fed meat that was illegally imported for possible use in Chinese restaurants.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the prime minister underlined the government's growing alarm at the scale of the crisis by saying that ministers are finally contemplating a vaccination programme. Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Farming Today: \"A few days ago even, this was generally regarded as anathema to very large parts of the farming community. As you track the disease and see how it spreads, things that may have seemed utterly unpalatable a short time ago have to be on the agenda.\"</p> <p>\"Of course it has consequences for the farming industry for the future.</p> <p>\"But we keep this under review, we are urgently looking at all those possible options for the future and it's something that we want to sit down and discuss with the farmers' leaders because we want to try, in so far as is possible to do this in a way that the farming community accepts and understands.\"</p> <p>A Downing Street spokeswoman said: \"Nick Brown will say that foot and mouth may have entered the country through illegally imported meat fed to pigs as catering waste pigswill.\"</p> <p>Mr Brown will stop short of naming restaurants which allegedly imported the smuggled meat for fear of prejudicing a possible police investigation. It is understood, however, that ministers believe officials have pinpointed the most likely source of the epidemic.</p> <p>Serving illegally imported meat in a restaurant is a serious criminal offence which would attract a jail sentence, government sources indicated last night. A restaurant owner could be prosecuted for a breach of health and safety regulations.</p> <p>Mr Brown will underline the government's concern over animal feed today by announcing plans to ban pigswill. The epidemic has been traced to a farm in Northumberland where animals were fed pigswill. The feed, which is made up of leftovers from restaurants and school dinners, is banned in Luxembourg and Portugal. It is fed to about 8,000 pigs in Britain.</p> <p>Unconfirmed reports last night suggested that health officials in the north-east had been alerted to possible illegal activity after a container of illegal meat, labelled for a Chinese restaurant, was found concealed inside a load of household goods after confirmation of the case at the farm in Heddon-on-the-Wall.</p> <p>Mr Brown will also announce other measures to ensure there is no repeat of the foot and mouth epidemic. He will close what may have been the fatal loophole which allows movement of sheep, but not pigs or cattle, within 21 days of purchase - which, according to Tony Blair, made tracing the disease as difficult as tracing the common cold.</p> <p>In Cumbria, contractors yesterday began the gruesome task of burying hundreds of thousands of animals in mass graves at Great Orton airfield, a long-abandoned Royal Air Force base near Carlisle. By the end of the day, 7,500 dead sheep had been dumped in the pits, drenched in lime and covered almost immediately with mountains of excavated mud.</p> <p>The air was full of the smell of diarrhoea and clotted blood and the thud of carcasses was barely audible above the noise of digging machinery churning out more burial pits. With 238 cases in Cumbria, more than a third of the national total, half a million carcasses stand to be buried at the site.</p> <p>Government sources said last night that any vaccination would be limited and would be designed to \"buy time\". Infected animals would all have to be slaughtered eventually to ensure Britain is able to resume exports.</p> <p>The government's moves highlight a last-ditch drive to persuade voters that ministers have sufficient control over the deepening crisis to justify pressing ahead with a May 3 general election campaign, rather than postponing polling day until June 7.</p> <p>Though October has been ruled out, June is becoming a serious option despite deep reluctance in Downing Street and Millbank to abandon their plans.</p> <p>Last night the Conservatives raised the stakes over the government's competence. The Tory agriculture spokesman, Tim Yeo, claimed that Labour had closed down a special unit to crack down on rogue sheep traders in October 1997.</p> <p>After the unit's abolition, sheep movements around Britain increased, Mr Yeo said. That is highly damaging if the Tories can make it stick.

      "bodyText": "Contaminated meat smuggled into Britain will be highlighted today by the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, as the most likely source of Britain's foot and mouth epidemic. A damning official account of the likely source of the outbreak will claim that pigs were fed meat that was illegally imported for possible use in Chinese restaurants. Meanwhile, the prime minister underlined the government's growing alarm at the scale of the crisis by saying that ministers are finally contemplating a vaccination programme. Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Farming Today: \"A few days ago even, this was generally regarded as anathema to very large parts of the farming community. As you track the disease and see how it spreads, things that may have seemed utterly unpalatable a short time ago have to be on the agenda.\" \"Of course it has consequences for the farming industry for the future. \"But we keep this under review, we are urgently looking at all those possible options for the future and it's something that we want to sit down and discuss with the farmers' leaders because we want to try, in so far as is possible to do this in a way that the farming community accepts and understands.\" A Downing Street spokeswoman said: \"Nick Brown will say that foot and mouth may have entered the country through illegally imported meat fed to pigs as catering waste pigswill.\" Mr Brown will stop short of naming restaurants which allegedly imported the smuggled meat for fear of prejudicing a possible police investigation. It is understood, however, that ministers believe officials have pinpointed the most likely source of the epidemic. Serving illegally imported meat in a restaurant is a serious criminal offence which would attract a jail sentence, government sources indicated last night. A restaurant owner could be prosecuted for a breach of health and safety regulations. Mr Brown will underline the government's concern over animal feed today by announcing plans to ban pigswill. The epidemic has been traced to a farm in Northumberland where animals were fed pigswill. The feed, which is made up of leftovers from restaurants and school dinners, is banned in Luxembourg and Portugal. It is fed to about 8,000 pigs in Britain. Unconfirmed reports last night suggested that health officials in the north-east had been alerted to possible illegal activity after a container of illegal meat, labelled for a Chinese restaurant, was found concealed inside a load of household goods after confirmation of the case at the farm in Heddon-on-the-Wall. Mr Brown will also announce other measures to ensure there is no repeat of the foot and mouth epidemic. He will close what may have been the fatal loophole which allows movement of sheep, but not pigs or cattle, within 21 days of purchase - which, according to Tony Blair, made tracing the disease as difficult as tracing the common cold. In Cumbria, contractors yesterday began the gruesome task of burying hundreds of thousands of animals in mass graves at Great Orton airfield, a long-abandoned Royal Air Force base near Carlisle. By the end of the day, 7,500 dead sheep had been dumped in the pits, drenched in lime and covered almost immediately with mountains of excavated mud. The air was full of the smell of diarrhoea and clotted blood and the thud of carcasses was barely audible above the noise of digging machinery churning out more burial pits. With 238 cases in Cumbria, more than a third of the national total, half a million carcasses stand to be buried at the site. Government sources said last night that any vaccination would be limited and would be designed to \"buy time\". Infected animals would all have to be slaughtered eventually to ensure Britain is able to resume exports. The government's moves highlight a last-ditch drive to persuade voters that ministers have sufficient control over the deepening crisis to justify pressing ahead with a May 3 general election campaign, rather than postponing polling day until June 7. Though October has been ruled out, June is becoming a serious option despite deep reluctance in Downing Street and Millbank to abandon their plans. Last night the Conservatives raised the stakes over the government's competence. The Tory agriculture spokesman, Tim Yeo, claimed that Labour had closed down a special unit to crack down on rogue sheep traders in October 1997. After the unit's abolition, sheep movements around Britain increased, Mr Yeo said. That is highly damaging if the Tories can make it stick. William Hague urged the creation of a \"crisis cabinet\" to tackle the disease, complaining that current efforts lacked urgency and co-ordination. An opinion poll for Channel 4's Powerhouse programme, yesterday showed a majority of voters unhappy with the government's handling of crisis and favouring a postponement of the election. The poll, carried out among 1,000 voters at the weekend, found that 77% believed that the crisis was out of control and that 69% believed that its handling had been slow and inadequate. More than half of Labour voters concurred. Yesterday - as 27 new cases of foot and mouth were confirmed, bringing the total to 634 - Mr Brown visited both Cumbria and Devon to explain and defend current policy.

      "body": "<p>Social services managers may be surprised to learn that they are a happier bunch than colleagues in other services when it comes to being inspected. </p> <p>For all their behind-the-scenes grumbles about joint reviews and the social services inspectorate (SSI), a Local Government Association survey suggests that they're still prepared to give their social care-specific inspections a qualified thumbs-up.</p> <p>There's widespread support for the principle of external inspection. Nearly eight in 10 social services respondents feel that SSI inspections \"enhanced accountability\". </p> <p>And slightly more said inspections were \"an important potential catalyst for improvement\" (compared with seven in 10 councils which say that of inspections in general). </p> <p>Social services respondents also have a more positive view than their colleagues about the theory matching the reality.</p> <p>Less than half of the latter group felt their inspection actually resulted in service improvements and a little over a quarter thought it led to innovation. </p> <p>Here, social services respondents are definitely more satisfied - 71% say that improved services came about thanks to visits from the SSI or joint review teams.</p> <p>\"I do find it amazing that anyone can be subject to an inspection and not find areas where they can get better. That's surely what we're about as managers,\" says Michael Hake, Solihull social services director.</p> <p>Doreen Redwood, assistant director with responsibility for performance management in Lambeth council, agrees that inspections can be tough but worthwhile. </p> <p>She says that in Lambeth the joint SSI and Audit Commission review has \"driven the improvement agenda and validated what we're doing and what we need to do\". </p> <p>Inspections, she says, are \"onerous\" but \"for us, they've helped make the 'change agenda' move\".</p> <p>But, there is all-round agreement that inspections make great demands on staff time.</p> <p>Ms Redwood says that, from June 1999 to March 2000, she worked full time, \"coordinating and writing the position statement needed by the joint review team and pulling together a library of key documents\". And that was before the inspection had even started.</p> <p>\"The position statement [a prerequisite for all joint reviews] was very time-consuming, answering a number of questions asked by the joint review team. The key managers also had to be involved in giving the answers. And they also had to ensure that they had the evidence.</p> <p>\"If we said we held regular supervision and appraisal of staff, the inspectors might say: 'Could I see your supervision notes for this member of staff?'\"</p> <p>And then there was the actual inspection. \"The inspectors were probably on site for a couple of months, virtually full time. It was very intensive. We had one member of staff co-ordinating it full time.</p> <p>\"In total, it probably took up a year of my life.\" No small commitment - especially in a department suffering the serious staff shortages common to all inner city authorities.</p> <p>If that one inspection were the be all and end all, maybe it wouldn't be so bad. But there are numerous inspections that social services are subject to. </p> <p>Mike Leadbetter, director in Essex, says: \"Last week, I saw my eighth set of inspectors in the past four months. They've included the joint review team, district audit, SSI, Mental Health Act commmission, West [winter emergency strategy team], Best value.</p> <p>\"I am tremendously supportive of the need to improve services and also to make sure that vulnerable people are safe. However, the amount of inspection and range of differing inspections is a cause for concern.</p> <p>\"One of my senior managers said to me: 'Some time we've got to stop counting and monitoring, and start managing.'\"</p> <p>Yes, agree managers, inspections are needed. But couldn't there be more joined-up working between the inspection teams, so that staff didn't have to keep providing different sets of data to different teams? Couldn't the inspection teams at least talk to each other - and agree on one set of data?</p> <p>Mr Hake says: \"There is an issue about bringing inspections together. But, in the longer term, the development of public service agreements should lead to common datasets, because you will agree targets and areas for improvements in advance.\"</p> <p>Paul Clark, former SSI inspector and deputy director of Hertfordshire county council's new children, schools and families department, says that things should get easier over time. </p> <p>Management information is improving, in part through the introduction of the Department of Health's performance assessment framework but also because of more powerful software and computer systems.</p> <p>Moreover, he says, the best inspection teams can often \"negotiate\" over the data that are available, so as not to put as great a burden on staff expected to collect more facts and figures for every fresh inspection. </p> <p>But sometimes, different data will have to be prepared for different inspections, so that like can be compared with like across the country. And, he agrees, that can feel like \"a burden too far\".</p> <p>Social services turn out to be less pleased than council respondents in general over the issues of the consistency of approach and the experience of the inspectors. </p> <p>According to one senior social services manager: \"Concerns have been voiced by directors about the lack of strategic experience. Inspectors may be very clever people. </p> <p>\"But not many of these people have had senior positions - they've been a middle or upper senior manager and the reviewers don't possess a sense of what it's like to run a large, complex organisation.\"</p> <p>One area that the survey just touches on is just what it feels like to be inspected. By and large, the SSI is felt to be \"fair and rigorous\". </p> <p>However, there is no doubt that having the SSI or joint review inspectors come in is stressful, as well as time-consuming. </p> <p>Chief social services inspector Denise Platt says she makes \"no excuse for the fact that external scrutiny can be a challenging process. After all, the role of the inspection team is to make sure that the services provided meet the agreed standards.\"</p> <p>Ms Redwood says: \"For many staff, there was the fear of the unknown,\" when the joint review took place in Lambeth. </p> <p>\"But it was also an opportunity for staff to voice their views. All the meetings were confidential and they could put comments [to the inspectors] in writing.

      "bodyText": "Social services managers may be surprised to learn that they are a happier bunch than colleagues in other services when it comes to being inspected. For all their behind-the-scenes grumbles about joint reviews and the social services inspectorate (SSI), a Local Government Association survey suggests that they're still prepared to give their social care-specific inspections a qualified thumbs-up. There's widespread support for the principle of external inspection. Nearly eight in 10 social services respondents feel that SSI inspections \"enhanced accountability\". And slightly more said inspections were \"an important potential catalyst for improvement\" (compared with seven in 10 councils which say that of inspections in general). Social services respondents also have a more positive view than their colleagues about the theory matching the reality. Less than half of the latter group felt their inspection actually resulted in service improvements and a little over a quarter thought it led to innovation. Here, social services respondents are definitely more satisfied - 71% say that improved services came about thanks to visits from the SSI or joint review teams. \"I do find it amazing that anyone can be subject to an inspection and not find areas where they can get better. That's surely what we're about as managers,\" says Michael Hake, Solihull social services director. Doreen Redwood, assistant director with responsibility for performance management in Lambeth council, agrees that inspections can be tough but worthwhile. She says that in Lambeth the joint SSI and Audit Commission review has \"driven the improvement agenda and validated what we're doing and what we need to do\". Inspections, she says, are \"onerous\" but \"for us, they've helped make the 'change agenda' move\". But, there is all-round agreement that inspections make great demands on staff time. Ms Redwood says that, from June 1999 to March 2000, she worked full time, \"coordinating and writing the position statement needed by the joint review team and pulling together a library of key documents\". And that was before the inspection had even started. \"The position statement [a prerequisite for all joint reviews] was very time-consuming, answering a number of questions asked by the joint review team. The key managers also had to be involved in giving the answers. And they also had to ensure that they had the evidence. \"If we said we held regular supervision and appraisal of staff, the inspectors might say: 'Could I see your supervision notes for this member of staff?'\" And then there was the actual inspection. \"The inspectors were probably on site for a couple of months, virtually full time. It was very intensive. We had one member of staff co-ordinating it full time. \"In total, it probably took up a year of my life.\" No small commitment - especially in a department suffering the serious staff shortages common to all inner city authorities. If that one inspection were the be all and end all, maybe it wouldn't be so bad. But there are numerous inspections that social services are subject to. Mike Leadbetter, director in Essex, says: \"Last week, I saw my eighth set of inspectors in the past four months. They've included the joint review team, district audit, SSI, Mental Health Act commmission, West [winter emergency strategy team], Best value. \"I am tremendously supportive of the need to improve services and also to make sure that vulnerable people are safe. However, the amount of inspection and range of differing inspections is a cause for concern. \"One of my senior managers said to me: 'Some time we've got to stop counting and monitoring, and start managing.'\" Yes, agree managers, inspections are needed. But couldn't there be more joined-up working between the inspection teams, so that staff didn't have to keep providing different sets of data to different teams? Couldn't the inspection teams at least talk to each other - and agree on one set of data? Mr Hake says: \"There is an issue about bringing inspections together. But, in the longer term, the development of public service agreements should lead to common datasets, because you will agree targets and areas for improvements in advance.\" Paul Clark, former SSI inspector and deputy director of Hertfordshire county council's new children, schools and families department, says that things should get easier over time. Management information is improving, in part through the introduction of the Department of Health's performance assessment framework but also because of more powerful software and computer systems. Moreover, he says, the best inspection teams can often \"negotiate\" over the data that are available, so as not to put as great a burden on staff expected to collect more facts and figures for every fresh inspection. But sometimes, different data will have to be prepared for different inspections, so that like can be compared with like across the country. And, he agrees, that can feel like \"a burden too far\". Social services turn out to be less pleased than council respondents in general over the issues of the consistency of approach and the experience of the inspectors. According to one senior social services manager: \"Concerns have been voiced by directors about the lack of strategic experience. Inspectors may be very clever people. \"But not many of these people have had senior positions - they've been a middle or upper senior manager and the reviewers don't possess a sense of what it's like to run a large, complex organisation.\" One area that the survey just touches on is just what it feels like to be inspected. By and large, the SSI is felt to be \"fair and rigorous\". However, there is no doubt that having the SSI or joint review inspectors come in is stressful, as well as time-consuming. Chief social services inspector Denise Platt says she makes \"no excuse for the fact that external scrutiny can be a challenging process. After all, the role of the inspection team is to make sure that the services provided meet the agreed standards.\" Ms Redwood says: \"For many staff, there was the fear of the unknown,\" when the joint review took place in Lambeth. \"But it was also an opportunity for staff to voice their views. All the meetings were confidential and they could put comments [to the inspectors] in writing. On the whole, staff were positive.\" So, there is backing for Ms Platt's assertion that: \"It is important to remember that the SSI is also there to support councils in their efforts to improve and, furthermore, that we should have a key role in identifying and promoting good practice. That should not be ignored.\" However, Ann Nutt, chairwoman of the participation advisory group, a users' and carers' organisation in Essex, says the county council's joint review was \"quite a negative experience\" from where she was sitting. \"It felt tokenistic at times,\" she says. \"It wasn't like a two-way conversation.

However, she says there was reluctance on the part of the inspectors and it took some to-ing and fro-ing before her group got their hands on a copy. Once the joint review team had released the document and held a meeting with both the council and users and carers, things became a little easier. Nutt hopes her group's experiences will be taken on board by the review team nationally. Overall, as they might say in one of their reports, the inspectors are serving most of their clients well most of the time - but there's room for improvement.",

The free votes, during the lords committee stage of the hunting bill, guarantee a lengthy \"pingpong\" session between the Commons and Lords over hunting if the general election is delayed. Peers will throw the amended bill back to the Commons where MPs are adamant hunting should be ended. Peers demonstrated their determination to preserve fox hunting when they lined up to tear strips off the government for attempting to ban the pursuit. Lord Cope of Berkeley, a Tory frontbencher, moved his party's campaign against the bill into a new gear when he complained it was \"distasteful\" to be asked to debate the issue while the countryside is being ravaged by foot and mouth. \"I find it distasteful, to say the least, to be discussing this bill when the countryside is itself plunged into such dreadful agony,\" he said. Earl Ferrers, a former countryside minister, complained that peers were being forced to debate hunting at a \"grotesque moment\".",

      "bodyText": "The battle for television viewers is being fought at the expense of variety in serious programming, the independent television commission said yesterday when it accused ITV and Channel 5 of ignoring major international stories and concentrating on crime and dysfunctional behaviour. ITV's flagship current affairs series Tonight with Trevor McDonald ignored the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while factual programmes such as This Morning, Live Talk and Trisha competed to cover the same topics, the ITC said. Channel 5 concentrated too much on human interest, disasters and sex. Both channels rejected the criticisms, saying they were committed to providing a wide range of programmes. According to the ITC, Tonight's coverage of international affairs was \"much lighter\" than its strong domestic reports. The Middle East crisis and US elections fiasco were ignored altogether. But the regulator conceded that Tonight, derided by critics when it was launched two years ago to replace World in Action, is now delivering \"strong and original journalism\". It is the most-watched current affairs show on British television although last year's average of 4.7m viewers has fallen to 4.2m since it was moved when News at Ten was reinstated in January. ITV pointed out that Tonight had covered 20 international news stories in the 41 episodes shown last year, including films on the far-right Austrian politician Jorg Haider, the threats facing white farmers in Zimbabwe, and the Mozambique flood crisis. It also announced that the veteran reporter Michael Nicholson is to present a series of four hour-long documentaries revisiting some of the stories covered in his 35-year career as a correspondent for World in Action, News at Ten and Tonight. While Channel 4 came out with a glowing report, Channel 5 was criticised for the number of complaints upheld. Earlier ITC criticism forced it to cut back its erotic output. Factual programmes \"would benefit from greater resources and a wider range of themes beyond human interest, disasters and dysfunctional behaviour\", the ITC said. A Channel 5 spokesman said: \"These news themes dominate the agenda of national newspapers and it seems odd that we are criticised for reflecting this.

CIA, the incumbent agency, will retain the lion's share of the business, planning and buying all campaigns for the Sunday Express. But rival OMD takes on the Daily Express business and MediaCom has been awarded the Daily Star account. The company says it will spend between \u00a310m and \u00a312m on advertising the new-look Sunday Express. The Daily Express will have a budget of \u00a37m-\u00a38m, while \u00a36m has been earmarked for the Daily Star. The decision takes the company's total advertising spend to \u00a325m, around three times what the Express used to spend on advertising. It brings it into line with arch-rival Associated Newspapers, which spends around \u00a325m on promoting the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and the Evening Standard. \"It is a sign of our commitment to rebuilding these great titles that Northern &amp; Shell has chosen to increase its investment in above-the-line advertising,\" said Stan Myerson, joint managing director of Northern &amp; Shell.

      "body": "<p>In America, they tell you, the Oscar ceremony is a primetime TV party, up there with the Superbowl as an annual popcorn-guzzling get-together around the small screen. For we Britishers, however, as the small hours approach, supposedly enthusiastic viewers fall away one by one, normal life hunkers down for the night, the sounds of the city die away and, finally, it's just the cable hook-up and you, hanging on with grim, unspeakable determination to see this thing through . . . </p> <p>It didn't start out like that. At 2.30am, when Barry Norman floated up from some nether armchair-world in Isleworth (the London suburb that's home to Sky's studios), I was feeling pretty sprightly. Barry promised us it would be fun, offered a patriotic word of encouragement to the (obviously doomed) British hopes and said he'd be back later. (He never was - clearly he got the hell out and went home to bed.) </p> <p>Cut to LA, and you're pitched headlong into the interminable frenzy that is the red-carpet crawl. Three grinning lunatics are our guides to the parade of billion-dollar celebrities strolling at a snail's pace towards their appointment with an inter- national TV audience of 800m (or so they say). Leading the way was a woman called Julie Moran from the TV show Entertainment Tonight. Sporting that patent Hollywood nip-and-tuck look, Julie reeled the A-list faces in. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas were first. Zeta-Jones sounded like a West Coast oil heiress - the first of several identity reorganisations her accent would undergo during the evening. </p> <p>Shoehorned into the following 20 minutes was an exhibition of the most cravenly insincere soundbite interviews I have ever heard, and I've heard some major-league crap in my time. Julie and her microphone-toting buddies radiated gallons of pre fabricated slavering excitement - at no stage even pretending to listen to what their subjects were saying. You could actually see Anthony Hopkins's eyes glaze as he tried manfully to match his interrogator's enthusiasm for the impending spectacle. </p> <p>Trying to spot the biggest idiot is a time-honoured Oscar sport, and a tittering Bj\u00f6rk, apparently swathed in a giant swan, was an early contender, as was Jennifer Lopez - was that a trick of the light, or were her clothes really transparent? </p> <p>At 3.06am it was time to move inside and, after an inaudible routine involving astronauts from the international space station (note to producers: lose the intergalactic stuff next year), the cheery face of Steve Martin hove into view. Thank God for the simple things - a smile, a wave and the ability to time a comic line. His opening routine indulged in the traditional big-timer bashing: \"Ellen Burstyn made herself 30lbs heavier and 20 years older, and Russell Crowe still hit on her.\" Cut to Crowe for reaction and he looks less than delighted. </p> <p>Now, one of the few benefits of watching the entire Oscar ceremony is that you can gauge how certain individuals' evenings are shaping up. Crowe, having turned up in sunglasses and some kind of Doc Holliday-style rig, exuded a you-da-man breeziness on the red carpet. Martin's little jabs turned the tide a little, but he pulled himself together later to present an award, for best editing. Then he was clapping fellow Gladiator employees on the back and looking on graciously as they name-checked him in their acceptance speeches. At just after 5am, Hilary Swank read his name out and forward he stumbled to receive the trophy. </p> <p>But that was later. The first Oscar was let go at 2.48am - to Crouching Tiger's art director - and three minutes later we witnessed the first attack of thespian ridiculousness, as Marcia Gay Harden won best supporting actress for Pollock. Her director and co-star, Ed Harris, a previously steely-eyed tough guy, lost his specs as he smothered her in hugs, and blew kisses as she hit the stage. My tape of The Rock goes straight in the bin. </p> <p>And then, at around 3.04am, the cold, clammy hand of boredom settled on proceedings. It came in the shape of Sting, who sang a song he wrote for the cartoon The Emperor's New Groove. It's a well-established unwritten rule that Oscar-nominated songs are terrible, and Sting's was a classic of its kind. A bit later we got the song from Crouching Tiger - that was terrible too, and they added a terrible dance sequence to go with it. Bj\u00f6rk made another bid for the evening's biggest idiot with her lifeless performance. It wasn't until two hours after Sting's turn, when Bob Dylan was beamed in from Australia at 4.57am, that things perked up a bit. Of course, his song was terrible, but Dylan has grown a pencil moustache and looks like Vincent Price. </p> <p>The organisers tried to juice things up by getting Hollywood's slinkiest to present the awards - an informal way of finding out who the film industry establishment thinks are the up-and-comers. So, everyone, get ready for a blast of movies over the next few years starring Penelope Cruz, Julia Stiles, Kate Hudson, Ben Affleck, Angelina Jolie and Mike Myers. Can't say you weren't warned. </p> <p>At around 4am battle fatigue really sets in, as the first birdsong begins. Amusing and/or interesting moments are few and far between, and you're reduced to giggling when Goldie Hawn loses her place on the autocue. Lots of broken English on the platform indicated that, despite Gladiator's final awards tally, South East Asians, Hispanics and Italians were a force to be reckoned with. </p> <p>In the final hour we get to the heavy stuff. Crowe grabs his award. And, at last, we get our prize idiot. Julia Roberts may have fallen short of the demanding standards set by Roberto Benigni and Gwyneth Paltrow in previous years, but for babbling incoherence and self-serving, manufactured hysteria, Roberts beats all comers. That's what you call a reliable performer. </p> <p>The last few awards get distributed, but it's all an anticlimax. No one's going to beat Julia. Poor Ridley Scott can't hide his grumpiness when pretty much everyone else from Gladiator gets a take-home and he loses out to snot-nosed punk Steven Soderbergh. Gladiator's three remarkably sane producers step up for their best-picture award. Seconds later, it's all over. Martin closes the show, the credits roll, the audience leap to their feet and rush the exits. Back in Blighty, it's 6am: grey skies, rumbling traffic and those birds are still chirping. But the torture is over.</p>",

The case comes amid signs that the court may be ready to reconsider its decision 12 years ago that such executions were constitutional. This month alone, it has stayed two executions of criminals suffering from learning disabilities. The Penry case is expected to revolve around procedural issues, in particular whether the juries which heard the case were fully informed about his disability. However, the supreme court agreed yesterday to hear the case of Ernest McCarver, a death row inmate in North Carolina with a mental age of 10, whose lawyers are objecting to execution on the constitutional grounds that it would represent \"cruel and unusual punishment\". No date was set for the McCarver hearing. Penry's lawyers will argue today that the Texas juries which sentenced him to death for a 1979 rape and murder, were not properly informed of the mitigating evidence of his learning difficulties. He has been assessed as having an IQ of about 60. Twenty-five states allow the imposition of the death penalty on defendants with learning disabilities, despite arguments by the American Bar Association and human rights groups that the practice violates the US constitution's eighth amendment banning cruel and unusual punishment. It will be argued that Penry was not morally culpable for his acts, citing a long history of abuse by his mother, who beat him, scalded him and forced him to eat his own faeces. Penry forced his way into the house of Pamela Carpenter, 22, in the Texan town of Livingston, beat her, raped her and stabbed her to death with a pair of scissors she had used to try to defend herself. Ms Carpenter's relatives and victims' rights organisations say his crimes showed signs of premeditation. They argue that a ban on executions of convicts with learning difficulties would open a loophole for murderers to escape the death penalty.

      "bodyText": "Lawyers for the home secretary, Jack Straw, were yesterday locked in a legal battle to avoid having to rewrite part of a law designed to protect rape complainants from having their previous sexual activity dragged up in court. The law, which came into force last December, has been thrown into conflict with a defendant's right to a fair trial under the Human Rights Act. Five law lords at a House of Lords hearing are being asked to review a court ruling that the law unjustly prevents an alleged rapist from referring to his recent sexual activity with his accuser as part of his defence that she consented to sex on the occasion in question. The accused man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is among a number of accused whose trials have been delayed while the issue is thrashed out. The appeal court said in January it was \"common sense\" that a person who had recently had sex with the defendant might have consented at the time of the alleged offence. But parliament had stipulated in the 1999 Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act that a complainant's sexual history could not be introduced in evidence or by way of cross-examination except in specific circumstances. On the face of it, said the appeal judges, this offended against the principle that everyone was entitled to a fair trial. At the start of a two-day hearing in the House of Lords, David Perry, counsel for the crown, said one of the problems that the new act sought to address was that \"insufficiently relevant\" evidence of a complainant's sexual history tended to \"overwhelm\" the main issues in a sex trial. In modern society, it was generally accepted that a woman's sexual experience with partners of her own choosing did not indicate a general willingness to consent or any lack of credibility in her evidence, he told Lords Slynn, Steyn, Hope, Clyde and Hutton. Such evidence \"introduces prejudicial material which invites the jury to condemn the complainant by reason of his or her morality prior to the event\", he said. He supported the view of the home secretary, separately represented at the hearing by David Pannick QC, that the act was workable and would not lead to unfairness because it allowed for exceptions. The law lords were due to hear argument from Mr Pannick and from Peter Rook QC, for the accused. They were also considering written representations. The hearing continues. Press Association",

Railtrack said that Sir John had been in advanced discussions about the post \"but for personal reasons unfortunately had to withdraw his candidacy.\" It said that it expected to make an announcement about the appointment in the near future \"reflecting the high calibre of candidates on the short list.\" Sir Philip said: \"We had all looked forward to Sir John joining the team and his proposed appointment had met with the approval from all the relevant parties. His late withdrawal due to understandable personal circumstances is obviously disappointing.\" Sir John was appointed chairman of Lattice last year when the group was created out of British Gas. Part of his previous experience was in shipbuilding. As chairman and chief executive of the loss making Belfast shipbuiders, Harland and Wolff, he managed a buy-out by the Norwegian shipping magnate, Fred Olsen. In spite of Railtrack's optimism, filling the position which the City has described as \"the job from hell\" is not going to be easy. The search has been going on since January after Sir Philip, often described in the business as \"the invisible chairman\" for being absent on key occasions, offered to quit. The chairman's job is key to the changes which are inevitable at Railtrack. The new appointment is expected to make important changes at board level, bringing in people with a practical experience of engineering. The government has been indirectly involved in the consultation, although Sir Philip has warned it off from trying to interfere too publicly. Railtrack is waiting for a government decision on whether it can have an advance of \u00a31.5bn to carry out further maintenance of the network following the Hatfield rail crash last October. The money would come out of a tranche of \u00a315bn already awarded by the rail regulator over the next five years.",

I don't think Sunnucks is good enough.\" Richard Ratner of Seymour Pierce said: \"This is very disappointing. They've not been able to attract enough good buyers to their head office down in Weymouth.\" New Look parted company with its former boss, Jim Hodkinson, after a bottom-pinching scandal a year ago. The firm then blamed poor trading on a lack of \"transitional clothes\" to bridge the gap between spring and summer. The company yesterday announced a 2% fall in like-for-like sales for the year to March. Profit forecasts were cut from about \u00a340m to \u00a334m. Mr Sunnucks said: \"The performance isn't satisfactory and I'm completely focused on fixing it.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For 10 days this obscure little mountain village was tagged in a thousand newspaper dispatches as the \"stronghold\" of the latest Balkan guerrilla movement.</p> <p>Now its red-tiled, two-storey houses and its fields dotted with blossoming fruit trees float helplessly in one of those strange vacuums which war often throws up.</p> <p>Selce is no longer \"controlled\" by the rebels, the self-styled National Liberation Army (NLA). Nor is it yet \"held\" by the government whose tanks and ground troops were still waiting three miles away when we walked in at midday yesterday.</p> <p>The reality is a village of deserted houses, some destroyed by Macedonian artillery, others abandoned, with their doors left open in the haste of sudden departure, with men, women, and children either leaving on foot or on mules to neighbouring settlements, or trudging for 10 hours across the snow-covered mountains towards Kosovo.</p> <p>The Macedonian government in Skopje has claimed a partial victory: after sending ground and helicopter-borne troops into the mountains, backed by tanks, the army was celebrating the capture of Gajre, a village on the ridge closest to Tetovo, the country's second city.</p> <p>The army had not yet penetrated more distant villages although guerrillas had retreated or put down their weapons and resumed civilian life.</p> <p>The people in Selce appear as abandoned as their homes. \"The NLA soldiers told us to leave, at about eight o'clock after dark last [Sunday]night. They said it was not safe to stay,\" said 29-year-old Enver Demiri when we met him with his neighbour and her small boy on one of Selce's steep streets. \"All except the oldest went to the hills. We decided to come back today because it seems calm but the whole place is empty and the NLA is gone.\"</p> <p>Indeed, the gunmen have vanished. In their hurry, or perhaps because they could not carry everything (the only road out of Selce is blocked by tanks) they left a sack of grenades, two ancient Chinese machine guns, and an old mortar in the main square outside the mosque.</p> <p>A trail of bloodstains was visible on the road. About a dozen houses were damaged in Sunday's ferocious barrage, their roofs smashed, jagged holes in walls, broken furniture thickly coated with brick dust, family photographs on the floor, and the teethmarks of shrapnel everywhere.</p> <p>Most people had spent the day in their cellars and only 10 or 20 suffered minor injuries, according to a local teacher, speaking by mobile phone about two hours before the rebels gave orders to leave.</p> <p>Did Enver Demiri feel better off without the NLA? \"We really don't know what to think,\" he replied. Did he feel abandoned? His answer was the same.</p> <p>Finding the village so empty, Enver was planning to leave again, fearing what a Macedonian army assault with ground troops might bring.</p> <p>An elderly couple pottered along, his stick tapping the cobbles. A traumatised calf careered around the streets, lowing in fear as it retreated, then gathered speed, not knowing where to turn. It had been in the yard of a house hit by a shell, we were told.</p> <p>On the walk into Selce, in a wooded hillside near Gajre, another scene of hasty abandonment. Blankets and shovels lay beside recently dug trenches. A pair of new boots stood near a lean-to made of sheets of metal covered in dead branches and leaves. A grenade launcher was propped against a pile of wood. At least two dozen guerrillas must have used this place to monitor the asphalt road below.</p> <p>The reason for their hurried exodus was clear.

      "bodyText": "For 10 days this obscure little mountain village was tagged in a thousand newspaper dispatches as the \"stronghold\" of the latest Balkan guerrilla movement. Now its red-tiled, two-storey houses and its fields dotted with blossoming fruit trees float helplessly in one of those strange vacuums which war often throws up. Selce is no longer \"controlled\" by the rebels, the self-styled National Liberation Army (NLA). Nor is it yet \"held\" by the government whose tanks and ground troops were still waiting three miles away when we walked in at midday yesterday. The reality is a village of deserted houses, some destroyed by Macedonian artillery, others abandoned, with their doors left open in the haste of sudden departure, with men, women, and children either leaving on foot or on mules to neighbouring settlements, or trudging for 10 hours across the snow-covered mountains towards Kosovo. The Macedonian government in Skopje has claimed a partial victory: after sending ground and helicopter-borne troops into the mountains, backed by tanks, the army was celebrating the capture of Gajre, a village on the ridge closest to Tetovo, the country's second city. The army had not yet penetrated more distant villages although guerrillas had retreated or put down their weapons and resumed civilian life. The people in Selce appear as abandoned as their homes. \"The NLA soldiers told us to leave, at about eight o'clock after dark last [Sunday]night. They said it was not safe to stay,\" said 29-year-old Enver Demiri when we met him with his neighbour and her small boy on one of Selce's steep streets. \"All except the oldest went to the hills. We decided to come back today because it seems calm but the whole place is empty and the NLA is gone.\" Indeed, the gunmen have vanished. In their hurry, or perhaps because they could not carry everything (the only road out of Selce is blocked by tanks) they left a sack of grenades, two ancient Chinese machine guns, and an old mortar in the main square outside the mosque. A trail of bloodstains was visible on the road. About a dozen houses were damaged in Sunday's ferocious barrage, their roofs smashed, jagged holes in walls, broken furniture thickly coated with brick dust, family photographs on the floor, and the teethmarks of shrapnel everywhere. Most people had spent the day in their cellars and only 10 or 20 suffered minor injuries, according to a local teacher, speaking by mobile phone about two hours before the rebels gave orders to leave. Did Enver Demiri feel better off without the NLA? \"We really don't know what to think,\" he replied. Did he feel abandoned? His answer was the same. Finding the village so empty, Enver was planning to leave again, fearing what a Macedonian army assault with ground troops might bring. An elderly couple pottered along, his stick tapping the cobbles. A traumatised calf careered around the streets, lowing in fear as it retreated, then gathered speed, not knowing where to turn. It had been in the yard of a house hit by a shell, we were told. On the walk into Selce, in a wooded hillside near Gajre, another scene of hasty abandonment. Blankets and shovels lay beside recently dug trenches. A pair of new boots stood near a lean-to made of sheets of metal covered in dead branches and leaves. A grenade launcher was propped against a pile of wood. At least two dozen guerrillas must have used this place to monitor the asphalt road below. The reason for their hurried exodus was clear. In scores of places lay evidence of Sunday's bombardment - huge round patches of leaves on the ground were charred and blackened, set on fire by the exploding shells. At Sipkovica across the valley we found another ethnic Albanian village where fear and relief flowed back and forth. The village might still be an artillery target, but so far it had only suffered minor damage in two short attacks. Only two houses had been hit, but in one of them 25 women and children had been sheltering on the ground floor when a shell crashed through a first-floor wall above. No one was wounded physically, but the shock has left many survivors bed-ridden with fear. In Sipkovica's small square, beside a minaret, stood a large group of men in leather jackets. They looked neither fully at home nor fully out of place. Who were they? The man appointed to guide journalists to the damaged houses did not explain their presence, though we had our suspicions. Were these the \"heroes\" of Selce, the men who turned it briefly and so expensively into a so-called guerrilla stronghold? Had they caused the wrath of the Macedonian artillery to descend? And when the \"victorious\" Macedonian army withdraws from Selce and its neighbouring string of isolated villages, will the NLA re-emerge with their rifles and their camouflage fatigues for another go at \"liberation\", whatever, in these mountain fastnesses, that word really means?

      "bodyText": "Police and border guards yesterday moved in to clear several hundred protesters from a railway line near the town of L\u00fcneburg as the biggest civil security operation to be mounted in Germany since the second world war swung into action. Between 15,000 and 20,000 officers were deployed by the German government to quell demonstrations against the resumption of nuclear waste shipments from France to Germany after a four-year pause. The first massive helium sealed containers were due to reach German territory late last night before travelling to Dannenberg where they were to be unloaded on to lorries. The convoy of six containers carrying 60 tons of nuclear waste pulled out of Valognes railway terminal, near the reprocessing plant at Le Hague, at 6.47am with two contingents of French riot police in its front and rear carriages. Another 1,200 police were deployed in the Manche region and several thousand more took up posts along the train's route through Caen, Amiens, Rheims and Nancy before a scheduled border crossing at Lauterbourg near Strasbourg before midnight. But despite the French authorities' fears, only about 20 protesters gathered at Valognes to witness the train's departure, firing a flare and holding banners reading \"La Hague: the dustbin is overflowing\". Anti-nuclear groups say their aim is to drive up the cost of waste shipments and persuade utilities that nuclear plants are not economical. \"Every transport from La Hague makes another transport to La Hague possible, securing the continued operation of the nuclear power plants,\" said Rasmus Grobe, a spokesman for a protest group whose symbol, a large yellow X, has appeared across the country. French anti-nuclear campaigners had earlier said they would not try to block the shipment. \"We think it's only right the waste should go back to where it came from,\" said Frederic Marillier, of Greenpeace. \"But we want to denounce this return, because it opens the door to trains coming from the other direction.\" In Germany, the last shipments four years ago sparked battles between police and demonstrators opposed to the storing of waste in a disused salt mine at Gorleben, south of Hamburg.

      "bodyText": "The highly emotive death of a baby Jewish girl, shot dead in her father's arms by a Palestinian sniper in the West Bank city of Hebron, looked likely last night to unleash fresh spasms of violence. As Israeli tanks pounded Palestinian neighbourhoods, there were widespread fears that the death of the 10-month-old infant could ignite barely contained hatreds in Hebron, where an enclave of 400 Jewish settlers - the most extreme in the West Bank - have regularly clashed with their resentful Palestinian neighbours. Yesterday's killing provides the most serious test yet for the hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon, who was elected to serve as Israel's strongman. Last night, he directly blamed Yasser Arafat's administration for the death, setting the stage for reprisal. Meanwhile, the army sealed all exits from Hebron - home to 120,000 Palestinians - and imposed a curfew on the 40,000 people living in the old town. The Jewish settlement there, which remained when the city was handed over to Palestinian rule in 1997, has been a regular source of tension and violence for years. Residents of the Abu Sneineh neighbourhood - the most likely source of fire on the infant - were told to evacuate their homes, suggesting imminent Israeli reprisals. \"The Palestinians are continuing to cause provocations with the purpose of drawing the Israeli Defence Force to respond harshly and escalate the situation in order to achieve their political goals,\" a statement from the Israeli army said. The dead baby, Shalhavet Pass, is the youngest Jew to die in a six-month uprising that has killed more than 430, mainly Palestinians. About 20% of the Palestinian victims were children. As news spread that Shalhavet had been shot in her father's arms, and that he was also wounded, demonstrators from the nearly settlement of Kiryat Arba began stoning Palestinian homes. The settlers of Hebron have been clamouring for the army to occupy the Palestinian-controlled neighbourhood of Abu Sneineh, where snipers, operating from half-built houses, have been firing on their outpost. \"We demand that all this territory be recaptured and the terrorists be wiped out. There is no other solution. The head of the snake must be crushed,\" said Noam Arnon, a spokesman for the Hebron settlers. Tensions in Hebron's old city will be even higher today when settlers say they will hold a 24-hour protest in the lanes of the Palestinian markets until Mr Sharon retakes the hills of Abu Sneineh. In the past, Palestinian stallholders say their carts have been regularly overturned by the armed Jewish settlers, and previous vigils have invariably ended in violence. Mr Sharon, who was meeting with his security advisers last night, must at last reveal the substance behind his promises to strike at those who shoot at Israeli soldiers and civilians, without subjecting Palestinians to collective punishment. Since his return from a visit to the US last week, he has grown increasingly bold in his pronouncements against the Palestinians. Mr Sharon now directly accuses Yasser Arafat's bodyguard - Force 17 - of plotting attacks on Israelis, in language that suggests the prime minister is providing the pretext for a major offensive against the Palestinian authority. \"We know with certainty that the Palestinian Authority security mechanisms, including the Force 17 guard, are behind the latest terrorist attacks,\" Mr Sharon told the former senator George Mitchell this week. Mr Mitchell is leading an international fact-finding team into rights abuses during the intifada.",

      "body": "<p>After Verona's game with Atalanta (Bergamo), the police kept us on the terraces for almost two hours in sub-zero temperatures. There is an ancient enmity between these two cities and we had to be protected from their fans. Or perhaps keeping us numb and shivering in the cold was the authorities' way of expressing that enmity.</p> <p>Stamping our feet, we huddled together and sang songs insulting the departing Bergamaschi. \"Sempre di meno,\" we called mockingly, \"O siete sempre di meno\" - there are fewer and fewer of you. It's the song you sing when you're winning and the opposing fans start to leave early, whereas in fact we had lost 3-0. Then no doubt because it was All Souls' Day, someone made a crucifix of plastic flag poles, the chorus leader spread his arms, let his head fall to one side and everybody sang the church hymn Risorgeremo - We shall rise again.</p> <p>At last all the Bergamaschi were gone, only the carabinieri were left. Since one of their helicopters had crashed only a couple of days before, the fans launched into an old fascist song that celebrated the modern and mechanised army, but with slightly altered words:</p> <p>\" E gira gira l'elica, romba il motor,</p> <p>L'elicottero dell'arma \u00e8 tornato al creator.\"</p> <p>(Turn propeller turn, out roars the motor,/ The policemen's 'copter's gone back to its maker.)</p> <p>How can one laugh at such bad taste? Ten men had died. Everyone laughed. I even saw a carabiniere smile. \"Verona merda!\" the Bergamaschi shrieked as we were escorted back to our bus. An ancient man leaned one arm on his walking stick to give us the finger raised high with the other. His face lit up in a wild grin. In the San Nicol\u00f2 stadium in Bari, high on cocaine and sodden with beer, a young Veronese went on and on shouting: \"Albanesi! Kurdi! Scafisti!\" The scafisti are the unscrupulous men who bring in illegal immigrants on their rubber scafi, or motorboats. \"Albanians! Kurds! Scafisti! Your mothers are whores! You live off our taxes.\"</p> <p>Suddenly the wind blew his hat off. It was a precious 1985 hat, the year of the miracle, when tiny Hellas Verona won the Italian championship, against the opposition of Michel Platini's Juventus and Alessandro Altobelli's Inter. There was a gale blowing. The hat sailed over the fence segregating the visitors area. \"Give me my hat back,\" the man shouted. \"Please! It's a 1985 hat. It's an original!\"</p> <p>In Bologna we lost 1-0. After taunting the home team's black players with monkey grunts, the Brigate giallobl\u00f9 - the Yellow-Blue Brigades, as the hardcore fans call themselves - bought Coca-Colas from a vendor at half time, slapping the boy on the back and chatting away cheerfully. He was black. \"Communisti!\" they shouted at the Bolognese. \"Rossi di merda\" - shit reds. Verona played terribly, as if the players didn't want to be there.</p> <p>In Perugia, the local fans had strung up a banner: \"A NON-RACIST TOWN IS ALWAYS IN SERIE A.\" The Veronese felt such provocation too banal to deserve comment. \"Merda siete,\" they began, \"e merda resterete\" - shit you are and shit you'll stay. It was routine stuff, ordinaria amministrazione, as they say. Likewise the game, which we lost 1-0.</p> <p>In Lecce it was the Verona fans who hung up a banner - \" CIAO NICOL\u00d2, EVEN ABSENT YOU WILL ALWAYS BE AMONG US.\" One of their own had died of cancer. Such commemorations are part of stadium ritual. \"Oltre la morte\" - beyond death - it says over the central gate to Verona's famous curva sud . \"Ciao Nicol\u00f2!\" they shouted. There was a slow hand-clap. Then they got down to it: \"Acqua e sapone, ci vuole acqua e sapone\" - soap and water, it takes soap and water (to wash a southerner).</p> <p>In the north-eastern town of Udine, half an hour before the game, one of the chorus leaders, a handsome man with salmon-pink shaven scalp and wrap-around blue sunglasses, said: \"Kids, the first chant is the most important. It sets the tone. So what can we sing that will make them really mad?\"</p> <p>It was a tough question. When you're down south, it's easy: you tell the opposition they're filthy, they stink. When you're in Turin they're gobbi - hunchbacks - because they're bent over Fiat's production line all day. The Bolognese are reds. That's obvious. The Vicentini are magnagatti - cat eaters, a half-starved underclass. But what can you say to the affluent, clean-living folks of Udine, just a stone's throw from the Slovenian border?</p> <p>\"Come on,\" the chorus leader challenges. \"What can we sing?\" His voice is that of the amused teacher, waiting to see if any of his pupils is especially clever.</p> <p>\"Slavi di merda?\" someone suggests. Slavs?</p> <p>The chorus leader shakes his head. \"It has to be something that will drive them completely crazy.\"</p> <p>Nobody knows. We've no idea.</p> <p>\"Terremotati!\" he declares.</p> <p>Of course: a terremoto is an earthquake. Terremotati are the victims of an earthquake. In 1976 the region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, of which Udine is the capital, was devastated by an earthquake that caused thousands of deaths. We are going to insult these people by reminding them that they were once profoundly unlucky. No doubt there will be some here who lost loved ones in that quake.</p> <p>There is something fantastically atavistic about this. For a moment it's as though we're back in one of the Sicilian novels of Giovanni Verga, full of the peasant community's choral contempt for those who have been born poor, or fallen fatally ill. The contemporary rhetoric of compassion dissolves in the acid of this cruel glee. If the final truth about the world is that it is a struggle for survival, a struggle that football endlessly re-enacts, maximum derision is reserved for the loser.</p> <p>\"This'll get them going,\" the chorus leader laughs. He raises his red face; the blue wrap-around sunglasses gleam. His hands are cupped round strong, well-moulded lips. The voice is huge, the tune the ever-serviceable Guantanamera . Now! \"TER-RE-MO-TA-TI!\" he sings and shouts together, \"O siete terremotati. Terremota-a-a-a-ti, o siete terremotati.\"</p> <p>Everybody joins in. There are only a few hundred of us, but the stadium is quiet. Or rather was. We have barely started a second round before the place explodes with rage. \"Veronese figlio di troia! Son of a bitch. Serie B. Serie B.\"</p> <p>The chorus leader rubs his hands and congratulates everyone. \"That's got 'em going.\" And I realise he has actually done the Udinese fans a favour. He has united them. They are feeling properly angry. The game will mean more for everybody.</p> <p>And so it did. It meant disaster for Verona, who played unusually well and lost against the run of play to go deep into relegation territory. A generous crowd of Udinese fans waited a good 40 minutes to scream their contempt as we were finally escorted to our buses. \"Sfigati!\" - unlucky ones!</p> <p>\"The civilising passage from blows to insults,\" wrote the Romanian philosopher Emil Cioran, \"was no doubt necessary, but the price was high. Words will never be enough. We will always be nostalgic for violence and blood.\"</p> <p>Strange, it occurs to me, as the bus accelerates through the jeering crowd and somebody hurls a can - strange that a Romanian wouldn't have thought of football as a possible solution.</p> <p>\u0095 Tim Parks is writing a book about following Hellas Verona.

      "bodyText": "After Verona's game with Atalanta (Bergamo), the police kept us on the terraces for almost two hours in sub-zero temperatures. There is an ancient enmity between these two cities and we had to be protected from their fans. Or perhaps keeping us numb and shivering in the cold was the authorities' way of expressing that enmity. Stamping our feet, we huddled together and sang songs insulting the departing Bergamaschi. \"Sempre di meno,\" we called mockingly, \"O siete sempre di meno\" - there are fewer and fewer of you. It's the song you sing when you're winning and the opposing fans start to leave early, whereas in fact we had lost 3-0. Then no doubt because it was All Souls' Day, someone made a crucifix of plastic flag poles, the chorus leader spread his arms, let his head fall to one side and everybody sang the church hymn Risorgeremo - We shall rise again. At last all the Bergamaschi were gone, only the carabinieri were left. Since one of their helicopters had crashed only a couple of days before, the fans launched into an old fascist song that celebrated the modern and mechanised army, but with slightly altered words: \" E gira gira l'elica, romba il motor, L'elicottero dell'arma \u00e8 tornato al creator.\" (Turn propeller turn, out roars the motor,/ The policemen's 'copter's gone back to its maker.) How can one laugh at such bad taste? Ten men had died. Everyone laughed. I even saw a carabiniere smile. \"Verona merda!\" the Bergamaschi shrieked as we were escorted back to our bus. An ancient man leaned one arm on his walking stick to give us the finger raised high with the other. His face lit up in a wild grin. In the San Nicol\u00f2 stadium in Bari, high on cocaine and sodden with beer, a young Veronese went on and on shouting: \"Albanesi! Kurdi! Scafisti!\" The scafisti are the unscrupulous men who bring in illegal immigrants on their rubber scafi, or motorboats. \"Albanians! Kurds! Scafisti! Your mothers are whores! You live off our taxes.\" Suddenly the wind blew his hat off. It was a precious 1985 hat, the year of the miracle, when tiny Hellas Verona won the Italian championship, against the opposition of Michel Platini's Juventus and Alessandro Altobelli's Inter. There was a gale blowing. The hat sailed over the fence segregating the visitors area. \"Give me my hat back,\" the man shouted. \"Please! It's a 1985 hat. It's an original!\" In Bologna we lost 1-0. After taunting the home team's black players with monkey grunts, the Brigate giallobl\u00f9 - the Yellow-Blue Brigades, as the hardcore fans call themselves - bought Coca-Colas from a vendor at half time, slapping the boy on the back and chatting away cheerfully. He was black. \"Communisti!\" they shouted at the Bolognese. \"Rossi di merda\" - shit reds. Verona played terribly, as if the players didn't want to be there. In Perugia, the local fans had strung up a banner: \"A NON-RACIST TOWN IS ALWAYS IN SERIE A.\" The Veronese felt such provocation too banal to deserve comment. \"Merda siete,\" they began, \"e merda resterete\" - shit you are and shit you'll stay. It was routine stuff, ordinaria amministrazione, as they say. Likewise the game, which we lost 1-0. In Lecce it was the Verona fans who hung up a banner - \" CIAO NICOL\u00d2, EVEN ABSENT YOU WILL ALWAYS BE AMONG US.\" One of their own had died of cancer. Such commemorations are part of stadium ritual. \"Oltre la morte\" - beyond death - it says over the central gate to Verona's famous curva sud . \"Ciao Nicol\u00f2!\" they shouted. There was a slow hand-clap. Then they got down to it: \"Acqua e sapone, ci vuole acqua e sapone\" - soap and water, it takes soap and water (to wash a southerner). In the north-eastern town of Udine, half an hour before the game, one of the chorus leaders, a handsome man with salmon-pink shaven scalp and wrap-around blue sunglasses, said: \"Kids, the first chant is the most important. It sets the tone. So what can we sing that will make them really mad?\" It was a tough question. When you're down south, it's easy: you tell the opposition they're filthy, they stink. When you're in Turin they're gobbi - hunchbacks - because they're bent over Fiat's production line all day. The Bolognese are reds. That's obvious. The Vicentini are magnagatti - cat eaters, a half-starved underclass. But what can you say to the affluent, clean-living folks of Udine, just a stone's throw from the Slovenian border? \"Come on,\" the chorus leader challenges. \"What can we sing?\" His voice is that of the amused teacher, waiting to see if any of his pupils is especially clever. \"Slavi di merda?\" someone suggests. Slavs? The chorus leader shakes his head. \"It has to be something that will drive them completely crazy.\" Nobody knows. We've no idea. \"Terremotati!\" he declares. Of course: a terremoto is an earthquake. Terremotati are the victims of an earthquake. In 1976 the region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, of which Udine is the capital, was devastated by an earthquake that caused thousands of deaths. We are going to insult these people by reminding them that they were once profoundly unlucky. No doubt there will be some here who lost loved ones in that quake. There is something fantastically atavistic about this. For a moment it's as though we're back in one of the Sicilian novels of Giovanni Verga, full of the peasant community's choral contempt for those who have been born poor, or fallen fatally ill. The contemporary rhetoric of compassion dissolves in the acid of this cruel glee. If the final truth about the world is that it is a struggle for survival, a struggle that football endlessly re-enacts, maximum derision is reserved for the loser. \"This'll get them going,\" the chorus leader laughs. He raises his red face; the blue wrap-around sunglasses gleam. His hands are cupped round strong, well-moulded lips. The voice is huge, the tune the ever-serviceable Guantanamera . Now! \"TER-RE-MO-TA-TI!\" he sings and shouts together, \"O siete terremotati. Terremota-a-a-a-ti, o siete terremotati.\" Everybody joins in. There are only a few hundred of us, but the stadium is quiet. Or rather was. We have barely started a second round before the place explodes with rage. \"Veronese figlio di troia! Son of a bitch. Serie B. Serie B.\" The chorus leader rubs his hands and congratulates everyone. \"That's got 'em going.\" And I realise he has actually done the Udinese fans a favour. He has united them. They are feeling properly angry. The game will mean more for everybody. And so it did. It meant disaster for Verona, who played unusually well and lost against the run of play to go deep into relegation territory. A generous crowd of Udinese fans waited a good 40 minutes to scream their contempt as we were finally escorted to our buses. \"Sfigati!\" - unlucky ones! \"The civilising passage from blows to insults,\" wrote the Romanian philosopher Emil Cioran, \"was no doubt necessary, but the price was high. Words will never be enough. We will always be nostalgic for violence and blood.\" Strange, it occurs to me, as the bus accelerates through the jeering crowd and somebody hurls a can - strange that a Romanian wouldn't have thought of football as a possible solution. \u0095 Tim Parks is writing a book about following Hellas Verona.

      "body": "<p>The Labour peer Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe, who, as plain Michael Cocks, was James Callaghan's chief whip from 1976 to 1985, has died aged 71. Deselected from his Bristol South seat in 1985 by the leftwinger Dawn Primarolo, who is now paymaster-general, he became an obsessive critic of the left. Then, in the decade after going to the Lords in 1987, he played the curious role of a bruising critic of the establishment, while attracting lucrative appointments from the Conservative government.</p> <p>He became vice-chairman of the BBC (1993-98) after a stint as deputy chairman of the London Docklands Development Corporation, where, on the nomination of environment secretary Nicholas Ridley, he succeeded Lord (Bob) Mellish, his predecessor as Labour chief whip.</p> <p>Cocks's willingness to take public jobs clashed with his reluctance to spend public money. At the BBC, he refused to inherit the chauffeur-driven car supplied to his predecessor, Joel Barnett, explaining that \"the 88 bus runs from my home to Oxford Circus. It's just a short walk from Broadcasting House.\"</p> <p>When he retired as BBC vice-chairman in June 1998, he revealed that feuding on the board had been so bad that he had not been told of the impending departure of the BBC director-general Lord (then Sir John) Birt.</p> <p>He also resisted what he called \"remorseless pressure\" to redecorate his room, explaining he had prodded Lord Irvine about his expensive wallpaper in the Lord Chancellor's official residence - and was unwilling to be categorised in the same way.</p> <p>Michael Cocks always volunteered, even to those who knew, that he spelled his name like \"the organ, not the apple\". This was his way of saying that, despite being the son of a congregationalist minister, he was one of the boys.

      "bodyText": "The Labour peer Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe, who, as plain Michael Cocks, was James Callaghan's chief whip from 1976 to 1985, has died aged 71. Deselected from his Bristol South seat in 1985 by the leftwinger Dawn Primarolo, who is now paymaster-general, he became an obsessive critic of the left. Then, in the decade after going to the Lords in 1987, he played the curious role of a bruising critic of the establishment, while attracting lucrative appointments from the Conservative government. He became vice-chairman of the BBC (1993-98) after a stint as deputy chairman of the London Docklands Development Corporation, where, on the nomination of environment secretary Nicholas Ridley, he succeeded Lord (Bob) Mellish, his predecessor as Labour chief whip. Cocks's willingness to take public jobs clashed with his reluctance to spend public money. At the BBC, he refused to inherit the chauffeur-driven car supplied to his predecessor, Joel Barnett, explaining that \"the 88 bus runs from my home to Oxford Circus. It's just a short walk from Broadcasting House.\" When he retired as BBC vice-chairman in June 1998, he revealed that feuding on the board had been so bad that he had not been told of the impending departure of the BBC director-general Lord (then Sir John) Birt. He also resisted what he called \"remorseless pressure\" to redecorate his room, explaining he had prodded Lord Irvine about his expensive wallpaper in the Lord Chancellor's official residence - and was unwilling to be categorised in the same way. Michael Cocks always volunteered, even to those who knew, that he spelled his name like \"the organ, not the apple\". This was his way of saying that, despite being the son of a congregationalist minister, he was one of the boys. This was helped by his bald head and soup-strainer moustache, which gave him the look of a well-fed Mexican bandit. As chief whip, he was known for his sometimes artificial rages and barrack-room invective against deviating Labour MPs. One heard this only rarely in the Commons, as during a 1983 speech by Michael Heseltine, then secretary of state for defence, when Cocks kept shouting: \"What about your war record?\" After he was ousted from Bristol South, his volcanic bile was largely directed at the left, and occasionally against establishment elitists like Lord (Roy) Jenkins of Hillhead. His anti-left views were distilled in his 1989 book, Labour And The Benn Factor, which blamed his party's decline in the 1980s almost wholly on Tony Benn, his former Bristol neighbour, and on London's \"loony left\". In the Lords, he became identified with Mellish, another rightwing social radical, who had also fallen out with his party after a leftwing takeover of his constituency, in Mellish's case in Bermondsey, south London. Cocks was born in Leeds, the son of Dr HF Lovell Cocks, a former principal of Western College, and the man who coined the phrase \"the Labour party owes more to Methodism than to Marx\".

Cocks is survived by Valerie and the children from his first marriage. \u0095 Michael Francis Lovell Cocks, Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe, politician, born August 19 1929; died March 26 2001",

      "body": "<p>He was the Old Grey Fox and Gangbuster Wickstead, one of the last of the high-profile Scotland Yard detectives, part of an era when men in belted raincoats would stand on the steps of the Old Bailey after a trial and pronounce on this gangster or that underworld feud. Commander Bert Wickstead, who has died aged 77, carried out hundreds of arrests, retired to become head of security at the News of the World and the Sun, and wrote his memoirs.</p> <p>Wickstead's admirers - and there were many both within and without the police - will recall the flamboyant head of many operations against some of postwar Britain's best-known criminal families. Nonetheless, his involvement in a number of controversial cases raised questions about his methods of achieving convictions.</p> <p>Born in Plaistow, the son of a railway foreman, Wickstead was educated at Burke senior school, and then took factory work. His chosen career would have been as a West Ham footballer, but two broken legs ended that possibility. During the war, he served with the SAS, stationed in India, Burma and Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and, after demobilisation, joined the police, encouraged by an uncle in the force.</p> <p>As a young detective inspector in Stoke Newington, north London, he solved 19 murders in two years. In 1965, he investigated a series of arson attacks on synagogues by the neo-fascists of the National Socialist Movement, and was delighted when the perpetrators were jailed. He was promoted to the rank of commander to run what was then J division, in London's East End. In 1970, he handled the investigation into what was then Britain's biggest bank robbery, the theft of \u00a3237,736 from Barclays in Ilford.</p> <p>A year later, Wickstead was given a free hand to form his own team, the serious crimes squad, to tackle major professional crime in the capital. The group was the first of the specialist units set up within the Metropolitan police in the 1970s.</p> <p>Unlike many of his plainclothes contemporaries at Scotland Yard, Wickstead was not a man to take a bribe. And, when the opportunity arose, he pursued the Met's bent officers with relish. He played a leading part in the investigation of Soho pornographers Bernie Silver and Jimmy Humphreys, whose revelations led to the jailing of 13 corrupt members of the obscene publications squad. He also investigated the case of the prostitute Norma Levy, which was to lead to the downfall of the Conservative minister Lord Lambton.</p> <p>In 1976, he reinvestigated the 20-year-old murder of gangster Tommy Smithson, who had been shot dead in 1956. But, although two Maltese criminals were charged with the crime, both were cleared after a key witness disappeared.</p> <p>During his three years with the serious crimes squad, Wickstead was often in the newspapers for his gangbusting exploits. His critics query whether the gangs, who were supposedly trying to fill the vacuum left by the Kray twins, were quite as mighty as he claimed. Some were really just extended families with violent tempers. But among those jailed as career criminals were the Tibbs, the Dixons and Philip \"Little Caesar\" Jacobs.</p> <p>A fearless soul, Wickstead once received threats that acid would be thrown at his wife, and he himself was bashed over the head when he went to investigate a burglary at a neighbour's house in Loughton, Essex, in 1975.</p> <p>It was in the early 1970s that he acquired his nickname as the Old Grey Fox, because, he claimed, he was always popping up and disappearing. Unimpressed by the trappings of wealth which dazzled some of his colleagues, he lived for many years in a council flat in Plaistow, east London, with his wife and three sons. His squad - whom he liked to call the Incorruptibles - was devoted to him, as he was to them, sending flowers to sick wives and showing concern for their personal welfare.</p> <p>\"I look for three main qualities in my officers,\" he said once, \"honesty, integrity and professional capability.\" He also had a gargantuan appetite for work, and would keep his detectives at it round the clock.</p> <p>Wickstead's most controversial case was the torso murders investigation of 1976-77, at the end of which Reg Dudley and Bob Maynard were both jailed for life for the murders of Billy Moseley and Micky Cornwall. The two men claimed in court that Wickstead had fabricated their confessions. As Dudley was taken from the dock, he shouted at Wickstead: \"You got the Tibbs, the Dixons, Silver and now us. You fitted us all up. But don't worry, you'll be fitted up, in the end, by your own kind.\"</p> <p>A campaign followed to free the men, and, after a three-year examination of the evidence, the criminal cases review commission last year recommended that the matter should go to the court of appeal, where it is now pending. Dudley was paroled in 1997, and Maynard was released on bail last November. Wickstead had predicted at the time of the conviction that \"do-gooders\" would claim it as a miscarriage of justice.</p> <p>Another criminal who claimed he had been verballed by Wickstead had his conviction overturned. Jimmy Saunders, jailed for his part in the 1970 Ilford robbery, was cleared after the bank-robber-turned-police-informer Bertie Smalls said that Saunders had not been on the job - and was therefore hardly likely to have confessed to it.</p> <p>One of Britain's best-known and most active thieves recalled Wickstead thus: \"He didn't take money and, if you're a policeman, you have to deal with scumbags every day. You have to go down to their level to achieve any results, so I understand why he did what he did.\"</p> <p>In 1977, Wickstead retired from police work to become security adviser to what was then News Group Newspapers, which serialised his memoirs in the Sun. He later became seriously ill with emphysema. But he remained, to the end, one of the Yard's legendary figures, far removed from performance indicators and best practice, admired by former colleagues, hated by villains - which is the way he would have wanted it.</p> <p>His first marriage was dissolved. He is survived by his second wife Jean, their two sons and a son from his first marriage.</p> <p>\u0095 Albert 'Bert' Wickstead, policeman, born April 23 1923; died March 19 2001</p>",

Bad, masculinist me for presuming that it should converse only on international affairs - why not affairs of the heart? Will I get my heart broken, I simper. \"I have my doubts.\" Hmm. Not exactly the unswerving affirmation I was hoping for. I attempt a final salvo. Why is it, dear Oracle, that I always end up looking like a dental assistant when I wear white? Another pause and then - inspiration. \"Look out for a handsome stranger - he may hold the answer.\" Spent the rest of the day out on the pavement waiting for him, but he didn't turn up, so I just got cold.",

      "bodyText": "Unmarried fathers who register their children's birth jointly with the mothers will obtain full parental rights under a clause in the adoption and children bill, which had its second reading in parliament yesterday. The reform will give unmarried fathers who sign the birth register the same rights as married fathers automatically have to a say in their children's upbringing. Under the current law, if parents are not married, the mother is treated as the child's sole parent and fathers can obtain rights only through a parental responsibility order by the court or a written agreement with the mother which is registered with the court. The government announced the planned reform in July 1998 to encourage fathers' commitment to the one in three children born outside wedlock. Ministers believe the distinction between married and unmarried fathers is now out of date. In 78% of births outside marriage, the father's details were included on the birth certificate. In three out of four of these joint registrations - and in 58% of all births outside marriage - the parents were living together. But the numbers of parental responsibility orders and agreements are only a small fraction of the number of births. Most unmarried fathers are thought to be unaware of their lack of legal rights. Jane Kennedy, minister in the Lord Chancellor's department, said: \"I am pleased to to bring about this long-needed reform.\" \u0095 New one-stop shops for people with family and relationship problems are to be piloted in five areas of England and Wales, the lord chancellor announced yesterday.

That there are no markets for recyclable material is a myth. The markets are there, but why should recycling have to pay for itself when landfill and incineration do not? The Community Recycling Network represents 300 not-for-profit environmental organisations. In partnership with local authorities, it delivers kerbside collection services to over 1.2m households (and rising) in the UK. We have never to my knowledge dumped any recyclable materials to landfill. We need the assorted financial instruments in the government's strategy to be made to work. Recycling, and through it real waste reduction, will surely yet become our everyday reality. Like Michael Quinton (Letters, March 24) I don't take a Sunday paper. The Saturday edition of the Guardian is newspaper enough for me. Andy Moore Coordinator, Community Recycling Network andym@crn.org.uk \u0095 Are any other readers as embarrassed as I am? Every three weeks I take my newspapers (daily Guardian and weekly Observer) to be recycled. The stack of newsprint seems to grow depressingly larger at each visit. Today there are 38 pages of broadsheet and 96 pages of tabloid; not untypical. Why do you think we all need these supplements? Who reads them? Eamon Grant Birmingham Eamon.Grant@uce.ac.uk",

      "body": "<p>It's late in the evening and little knots of T-shirted teenagers are trawling the bars of Gloucester, seemingly impervious to the wind-driven March rain. A police van noses slowly along Eastgate. Outside each venue stands a bouncer in a Crombie-style overcoat.</p> <p>The only sign of trouble tonight is some loud banter and two girls in sparkly tops arguing furiously outside the H2O Bar. Even here, no one is taking much notice.</p> <p>Inside the bar (\"All Drinks \u00a31\") minimal decor is supplemented by swirling lights and a heavy beat. A booted girl with cleavage and a mini-skirt spots a friend and totters over to give her an alcohol-fuelled hug. But despite the warm atmosphere there are some who are not welcome in Gloucester's city-centre bars - troublemakers barred under the city's Pubwatch scheme for violence or involvement with drugs. And some of these alleged miscreants have complained that city landlords breached the Human Rights Act when they got together to ban them.</p> <p>Under the Pubwatch scheme, one of more than 3,000 around the country, the licensees of more than 40 city pubs have agreed to stand together against disorder. Displayed prominently inside their premises are the names of the banned, printed in 36-point bold letters. There are 23 people serving out 12-month exclusions at the moment, six of them female.</p> <p>Now, though, the Gloucester police force has been forced to withdraw from the programme after a local solicitor representing two excludees claimed it breached the Human Rights Act on two counts: that his clients were being punished without a fair trial, and that a ban interfered with their right to respect for their private lives. Around the country, other schemes have been forced to change their practice as a result of similar complaints. Even the government has got involved, with ministers promising legislation that should lead to more legally binding bans.</p> <p>In Gloucester, pub landlords still get together regularly to discuss troublesome individuals but they don't receive information or back-up from the police any more. Previously a police licensing officer passed details of offenders to landlords and served notices on those who were barred.</p> <p>In the circumstances, Clinton Douglas and Simon Morris might be feeling rather pleased with themselves. It was a letter from their solicitor, John Holmes, that persuaded the police to drop out of the Gloucester Pubwatch scheme. But the two bricklayers aren't in the least smug. They are still rattled by what happened after they got into a ruck with the doormen at Lanson's nightspot in December 1999. Although they were charged with affray and assault causing actual bodily harm, they had not been convicted when a police officer asked them to sign a form acknowledging they were barred from city pubs for a year. They agreed, but later Holmes protested on their behalf.</p> <p>Douglas, who admitted hitting a doorman though he said he didn't start the trouble, was fined \u00a3100 for assault; Morris was bound over to keep the peace after the other charges were dropped. Even though their ban has now expired, the pair say they don't go out to the pub any more. They feel marked, and they are angry that acquaintances have seen them listed as troublemakers outside local bars they have never even been into.</p> <p>\"Basically we were guilty before they even proved anything. I just think it's wrong that people are believed to be guilty when they haven't been given a chance to say anything,\" says Morris, a former goalkeeper for Gloucester City Football Club.</p> <p>Holmes, who was a city councillor at the time of the incident and a former leader of the council, agrees with him. Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, enshrined in UK law by the 1998 Human Rights Act, gives all citizens the right to a fair trial, he points out. And because the police were involved in the scheme, it became in effect a public body covered by the act. Furthermore, Article 8, which protects respect for private life, was also breached because Morris and Douglas could no longer go about their lives as they did before.</p> <p>\"I do think these quasi-judicial proceedings can fall foul of the Human Rights Act. And these two lads had a strong sense of injustice that this had been done to them when they hadn't been found guilty of anything. But in the end it got dropped because their case finished and we didn't take it further,\" he says.</p> <p>The management of Lanson's has changed since the incident and the former owner has left the area, but officers of the local Pubwatch scheme say the pair could have used a right of appeal if they wanted to try to overturn the ban. And Malcolm Eidmans, Secretary of National Pubwatch, is also unimpressed by Holmes' stand.</p> <p>\"This was all about protecting his clients' rights, but sometimes people forget there are responsibilities that go with rights, too,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Article 8 is a right to freedom of living. It doesn't give anyone the right to walk into a pub and demand to be served.\"</p> <p>The potential threat of legal action has presented major headaches for Pubwatches around the country, Eidmans says. \"We have advised schemes not to involve the police service in the process because if they do, the Pubwatch scheme can be thought to constitute a public authority. And the thought of being taken to judicial review can make people quite nervous.\"</p> <p>Ministers agree that something has to be done, not least because of the terrible consequences of alcohol-related crime. One in five violent incidents now happens in a pub or club, and eight out of 10 cases at accident and emergency departments in peak time are alcohol-related.</p> <p>Home Office Minister Charles Clarke, told the House of Commons last month that the government planned to legislate as soon as possible to force courts to consider passing exclusion orders on problem drinkers. Although the power to pass such legal orders already exists, it is little used. In 1995, the last year for which figures are available, just 28 orders were issued.</p> <p>Several of those orders have been passed recently in York, though, where there is a thriving Pubwatch scheme working closely with magistrates. Members of the scheme believe it complies fully with the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>Ashley Fitzhugh, a licensing officer in the city, explains that door or bar staff in more than 200 city pubs hold pagers, through which they can be alerted if trouble is coming their way. In addition, the local police magazine, The Copper's Tale, currently bears the pictures of 11 people banned for troublemaking, plus a further three who have been officially declared \"habitual drunkards.\" These may not have been violent, but are recognised as having serious drink problems. Because all these people have been served with exclusion orders by the courts, Fitzhugh says, the scheme is beyond challenge.</p> <p>\"All these people have been convicted of offences. It isn't just done willy-nilly,\" he says. \"I think the trouble starts when the police get together with landlords and just decide to ban a particular person. Here, we've got the crown prosecution service on side so they ask for exclusion orders as a matter of course.\"</p> <p>However, the human rights organisation Liberty would like to see the issue clarified in the courts.

On the one hand there is information which is really in the public domain, such as previous convictions, and on the other hand there is information which is really intelligence or suspicion - gossip almost,\" she says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, pub landlords continue to defend their right to exclude. In Blyth, Northumberland, a local solicitor has twice complained on behalf of clients that pub bans constituted a breach of human rights. One of the two was accused of threatening a pub landlady. The other was the father of a man jailed for an attack in a pub, who said his rights were contravened by the shame of having his son's name posted on a list of banned individuals.</p> <p>The local Pubwatch chairman, John Lewis, describes such interventions as \"diabolical\". He adds: \"Everyone deserves human rights - you and I and everyone else. But now it seems that human rights are only for the criminals of this world. These people have continually contravened the human rights of landlords. We're not finding them guilty of any crime, but we are saying we don't want them in our public houses.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u0095 Isn't there a law against filming in court? I mused while watching a preview tape of Partners in Crime, a Channel 4 fly-on-the-wall documentary series starting tomorrow evening. It's the nearest we've come to showing the legal parts of the criminal justice system as they really are. The programme I saw (the first of four) was devoted mainly to the depressing story of a minor recidivist with a history of fluffing the opportunities he has been given to reform. His lively, sympathetic but realistic lawyer - Nottingham solicitor Digby Johnson, who is blind - tries to get him one final chance of going straight. The alternative is a long prison sentence. All the conversations between lawyers and clients are real, as are the contributions of the police and others in the system. The pre-trial procedures in court and Johnson's arguments in mitigation are reconstructions, but, unlike most such exercises, they're done not by actors but by the real participants - solicitor, magistrates and the defendant - and it's convincing. Here's the picky but. Some of the filming was done in a decommissioned courtroom in the Nottingham courts complex; but that is still, on one reading of the law, filming within the court's \"precincts\", which isn't allowed. I mention this only to demonstrate how absurd it is that the ban on televising court proceedings still relies on an act of parliament of pre-TV vintage - 1925 - aimed at banning photos in court; moreover, it doesn't define \"precincts\". Whatever decisions are eventually taken on the future of filming in court, at least let's make the law clear.</p> <p>\u0095 A few weeks ago I wrote about the copyright dispute over the iconic 1963 photograph of Christine Keeler sitting astride that chair, seemingly naked. Lewis Morley, the photographer, claimed a copyright infringement when publicity snaps for a revival of a Joe Orton play featured actress Alison Steadman in exactly the same pose. Readers have pointed out that the pose had been used often since, to publicise, among others, the Spice Girls, Keith Chegwin (for his naked Channel 5 programme) and a property developer. Now the magazine Amateur Photographer (AP) has revealed a very similar photo that pre-dates Morley's Keeler by five years. AP's editor, flicking through old issues of the magazine, chanced on a portrait of a ballerina called Mimi, by an Italian photographer. There's no reason to believe that Morley saw that snap, but it does raise all sorts of philosophical, artistic and legal issues about the nature of original creativity.</p> <p>\u0095 Here's another typical story of everyday litigants. Chap getting a divorce goes to the firm Mishcon de Reya (once famous for being solicitors for Diana, Princess of Wales). During a telephone conversation, chap asks his solicitor for a quote for the conveyancing work on the sale of the former matrimonial house. When told the amount, the chap goes berserk, making what were later described in court as \"grossly indecent, obscene and menacing statements\" to the solicitor, in language so strong as to be a criminal offence. Mishcons understandably decides it no longer wishes to act for the angry chap and prepares a request to the court asking to be removed from the official record as his solicitors. The firm provides the transcript of the telephone conversation. Unfortunately, by mistake, it also sends the transcript to the wife's solicitors. When wife reads husband's outburst she wants to use it against him when their court case comes up, as evidence that he's unfit to have contact with their child. Oh no she can't, says chap, it was a legally privileged conversation between me and my lawyer. Oh yes she can, says the appeal court. Chap is now even angrier.</p> <p>\u0095 This is the sad announcement of the end of a campaign. For years, at great cost to my health, finances and personal security, I have fought fearlessly on behalf of truth and accuracy. Alas, after a succession of small disappointments, an event last week persuaded me that I have finally been beaten. There it was, filling the whole front cover of Monday's media section of the country's best daily newspaper. A gavel. The very gavel that I have so often, so passionately pointed out does not exist in English justice. Unlike judges in the US, judges here do not have gavels. Illustrating judicial authority by showing a gavel is therefore . . . I would say wrong, but I don't wish to antagonise the editor of whatever excellent newspaper it was that featured the offensive artefact. I retire from the fray, bitter and exhausted.</p>",

I mention this only to demonstrate how absurd it is that the ban on televising court proceedings still relies on an act of parliament of pre-TV vintage - 1925 - aimed at banning photos in court; moreover, it doesn't define \"precincts\". Whatever decisions are eventually taken on the future of filming in court, at least let's make the law clear. \u0095 A few weeks ago I wrote about the copyright dispute over the iconic 1963 photograph of Christine Keeler sitting astride that chair, seemingly naked. Lewis Morley, the photographer, claimed a copyright infringement when publicity snaps for a revival of a Joe Orton play featured actress Alison Steadman in exactly the same pose. Readers have pointed out that the pose had been used often since, to publicise, among others, the Spice Girls, Keith Chegwin (for his naked Channel 5 programme) and a property developer. Now the magazine Amateur Photographer (AP) has revealed a very similar photo that pre-dates Morley's Keeler by five years. AP's editor, flicking through old issues of the magazine, chanced on a portrait of a ballerina called Mimi, by an Italian photographer. There's no reason to believe that Morley saw that snap, but it does raise all sorts of philosophical, artistic and legal issues about the nature of original creativity. \u0095 Here's another typical story of everyday litigants. Chap getting a divorce goes to the firm Mishcon de Reya (once famous for being solicitors for Diana, Princess of Wales). During a telephone conversation, chap asks his solicitor for a quote for the conveyancing work on the sale of the former matrimonial house. When told the amount, the chap goes berserk, making what were later described in court as \"grossly indecent, obscene and menacing statements\" to the solicitor, in language so strong as to be a criminal offence. Mishcons understandably decides it no longer wishes to act for the angry chap and prepares a request to the court asking to be removed from the official record as his solicitors. The firm provides the transcript of the telephone conversation. Unfortunately, by mistake, it also sends the transcript to the wife's solicitors. When wife reads husband's outburst she wants to use it against him when their court case comes up, as evidence that he's unfit to have contact with their child. Oh no she can't, says chap, it was a legally privileged conversation between me and my lawyer. Oh yes she can, says the appeal court. Chap is now even angrier. \u0095 This is the sad announcement of the end of a campaign. For years, at great cost to my health, finances and personal security, I have fought fearlessly on behalf of truth and accuracy. Alas, after a succession of small disappointments, an event last week persuaded me that I have finally been beaten. There it was, filling the whole front cover of Monday's media section of the country's best daily newspaper. A gavel. The very gavel that I have so often, so passionately pointed out does not exist in English justice. Unlike judges in the US, judges here do not have gavels. Illustrating judicial authority by showing a gavel is therefore . . . I would say wrong, but I don't wish to antagonise the editor of whatever excellent newspaper it was that featured the offensive artefact. I retire from the fray, bitter and exhausted.",

      "body": "<p>In his 1973 painting Painting, Smoking, Eating, Philip Guston shows us just that. A man lies in bed. His head is a great cyclopian kidney, unshaven, with a cigarette in his mouth. There's the bare dangling lightbulb and the cord of the blind. A pile of old hobnailed shoes, and paint brushes stubbed out in old paint cans, rear up on the far side of the bed. He looks at all this as he smokes. A plate of chips, bloodied with ketchup, rests like a hideous still life on the counterpane. </p> <p>The whole scene is in thick pink light, thick pink paint. The palette is reduced to cadmium red, mars black, titanium white, a little ochre on the side for the fries. The paint scuffs the canvas, outlining and filling things in with a slow, remorseless deliberation. The smoke puffs out in a leaden steam-train plume. </p> <p>Philip Guston was born Phillip Goldstein in Montreal, the son of Jewish parents who escaped the pogroms in Odessa. His father sold junk, rags and bones, old shoes. When he was 10, the artist discovered his father hanged from the rafters of a shed. Can you now look at a blind pull or an outlined lightbulb and flex in a Guston painting without thinking of a noose? And what does a pile of old shoes make you think about? </p> <p>Painting, Smoking, Eating was last seen at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in Guston's retrospective in 1982, following the artist's death in 1980. It is here again now as one of the 80 or so works in the Whitechapel's Centenary show, celebrating its 100th birthday. Here is a Rothko, there is a Turner, a George Stubbs, a mad, boggle-eyed Emile Nolde. None of this adds up to very much, except to signal a hidden history - of things, of exhibitions, of an institution. Look carefully and you'll find a beautiful drawing of the desert floor by Vija Celmins, and a 1930s photograph of Claude Cahun, a self-portrait of the artist, asleep on a cupboard shelf. A willy by Lucian Freud and a Bill Viola video. What the hell, you say, it's just a bit of a bash. It is a pity Gerhard Richter and Max Beckmann, Jackson Pollock and Arshile Gorky and dear old Ferdinand L\u00e9ger couldn't come. </p> <p>This is a rather old-fashioned show in terms of its installation: things on the wall, things on the floor, things on plinths. There are pleasant little conjunctions - a stern Bob Law near-monochrome next to a Japanese scroll; a Mario Merz neon phrase, lit up in a rusty little tub of wax, next to a Robert Rauschenberg 1961 Combine Painting (as though Rauschenberg, in his use of everyday scraps, looked forward to the noble impoverishments of Italian post-minimalism). The Rauschenberg also faces a Bruce Nauman down the length of the upper gallery, as though their shared allegiance to the spare poetry of the commonplace brackets the space. Somewhere between them hangs the Guston, which seems to suck everything else here into the orbit of its enclosed world. Or perhaps I like the Guston too much, or it is just the thing I happen to need right now. The curators (who include artists Anish Kapoor and Rosemarie Trockel, selecting about 20 works apiece) want to tell us a story. But we come to shows with our own needs, our own wish-lists and antipathies. </p> <p>Patrick Caulfield's gentle, enigmatic 1963 portrait of Juan Gris is placed so that Caulfield's Gris appears to be looking at one of Gris's own late cubist works, hung on the adjacent wall. Jeff Wall's back-lit photograph of a grubby sink, with its wretched bar of soap and grimy Formica, is a play on the modernist aesthetic seen in Gris's work, in Mondrian and in Ben Nicholson. There's a show in here somewhere, about the clean and the dirty, abstraction and the real, but this isn't it. </p> <p>This kind of curatorial play, with its tiny narratives, little rhymes, dissonances and juxtapositions, attempts to build a coherence where none exists. When this is done with intelligence, flair and sensitivity an exhibition can really take off, and works can enliven one another in interesting ways. But there's too much going on here for that, too many curators, too many old shows and old movements to nod to, too many debts to be paid. Somehow the Whitechapel's geographical position, and the history of the neighbourhood, with its succession of immigrant diasporas (from the Huguenots to Somalis, the Jews escaping the same pogroms as Guston's and Rothko's parents, the Bengalis and Bangladeshis), needs to be reflected. I like to walk along Whitechapel Road, and hear the amplified call to prayer from the mosque wafting over the traffic, to walk into the gallery and find the latest thing from Dusseldorf, or a drug-crazed Belgian artist-poet (Henri Michaux), or a reconstruction of 1970s conceptual chic. </p> <p>Of course, this show can't tell the whole story of the Whitechapel, though the cata logue makes a pretty good job of its history. Exhibitions also depend on what can be borrowed: there was no way, for instance, the gallery was going to get Picasso's Guernica back, after its fleeting appearance here in a private-hire show in 1939 (although Nick Serota, director in the 1980s, tried to nab the painting en route from New York's Museum of Modern Art, on its triumphant return to Spain). Clement Attlee, local MP and leader of the Labour Party, gave a speech in front of the painting here in 1939. Tony Blair wouldn't even dare a photo opportunity in front of a Caravaggio at the Royal Academy the other week. </p> <p>Looking at the Whitechapel Centenary catalogue reminds one of the changing manners of exhibition display over the past century: from the clutter of the salon-hang, to hairy-walled hessian and giant's causeways of white-painted plinths, to the more open, less encumbered displays of recent years. These differences mark the change in artists' thoughts about the status of the things they make, and how they occupy and are perceived in space. </p> <p>There are no neutral spaces, however white and plain the walls, however unobtrusive the lighting, however anonymous and sympathetically tailored the architecture. In any case, there's once more a curatorial tendency to present things not as works in themselves, commanding more and more theatrical emptiness, but as examples of kinds of art, as illustrations to some educative text. Where once galleries moralised, now they try to explain, falling over themselves to be pluralistic, accessible, relevant. What we now might see as the appallingly overhung 1958 Pollock show, with its false, unpainted breeze-block walls and the fussy false ceiling, were, I guess, par for the course in the late 1950s. Although what goes around comes around, and such retro-hangs and intrusive exhibition designs are returning. </p> <p>Institutions have histories, just as artworks do - and so too do spectators. Going to the Whitechapel Centenary is to revisit previous selves, to hear distant echoes. The Willem de Kooning drawing here looks forward - obliquely - to Thomas Sch\u00fctte's cast aluminium figures, which once stood near where the de Kooning now hangs. Sch\u00fctte isn't here, but the de Kooning made me think of him anyway. Then we have Mondrian's tree, a hilarious Arthur Boyd painting of a dog by a billabong, Hogarth's Happy Marriage close by Frida Kahlo's iconic 1940 Self Portrait. Good things and odd things and things that once looked serious, along with the flotsam, washed up on the shores of discarded fashion. </p> <p>This is the fate not just of most art, but of most curatorial ventures, and of our infatuations as spectators, our little love affairs with artworks. It is impossible to look at a snap of gallery-goers at a 1960s private view and not laugh at the clothes, the Jason King mustachios. Or smirk when we read about shows called Black Eyes and Lemonade or Decorative Art from the Arts Group of Farnham. We will look back, one day, at the souvenir pictures of the artists' party that took place before the Centenary show opened, and laugh some more. Did we really look like that, did we really take this art, and ourselves, so seriously; was there really a show here once called Temporary Accomodation - and who was Philip Guston? But some things will remain, and stay great, and get better with time, and there will be surprises. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> The Whitechapel Centenary Exhibition is at the Whitechapel Gallery, London E1, until May 20.

Compared to the last time an England football team came here 12 years ago, moreover, it is a clearly a country frog-marching itself forward in an effort to catch up with modern Europe. </p> <p>Not unlike the present England side, who arrived here last night to begin preparing for tomorrow's World Cup qualifier in the Qemal Stafa stadium fervently hoping that they are about to add another three points to those gathered against Finland at Anfield on Saturday. </p> <p>The nervous, nailbiting aspect of that win, along with the lateness of Albania's 2-1 defeat by Germany in Leverkusen on Saturday evening, when they held out until the 88th minute, does not entitle Sven-Goran Eriksson's players to think that the Albanian experience will be anything but tricky at the very least. </p> <p>Eriksson's team is likely to show just the one change forced on the England coach by Sunday's withdrawal of Steven Gerrard for further treatment on his back problem.

      "bodyText": "Albania may still be peppered with pill-boxes, just in case the Ottomans get uppity again, but at least it is a land where sheep may safely graze. Compared to the last time an England football team came here 12 years ago, moreover, it is a clearly a country frog-marching itself forward in an effort to catch up with modern Europe. Not unlike the present England side, who arrived here last night to begin preparing for tomorrow's World Cup qualifier in the Qemal Stafa stadium fervently hoping that they are about to add another three points to those gathered against Finland at Anfield on Saturday. The nervous, nailbiting aspect of that win, along with the lateness of Albania's 2-1 defeat by Germany in Leverkusen on Saturday evening, when they held out until the 88th minute, does not entitle Sven-Goran Eriksson's players to think that the Albanian experience will be anything but tricky at the very least. Eriksson's team is likely to show just the one change forced on the England coach by Sunday's withdrawal of Steven Gerrard for further treatment on his back problem. Nicky Butt is set to come into midfield alongside his Manchester United team-mates, Paul Scholes and David Beckham. It is already clear that Eriksson does not intend to be pressured by media criticism of Andy Cole's failure to score in 12 England appearances, albeit five of them as a substitute, which was heightened by his shooting wide from eight yards on Saturday when he had only the Finland goalkeeper to beat. \"I still think Andy Cole is a very good option,\" was Eriksson's response after the match. \"I'm happy with the way he is playing and not worried at all that he didn't score.
