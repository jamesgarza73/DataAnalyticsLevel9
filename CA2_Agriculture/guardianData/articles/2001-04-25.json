The daughter of a butcher and a Clarks' shoe fitter, she has strived to forge a new image for Camelot since joining in 1997, moving the organisation away from the fat-cattery associated with the previous regime. </p> <p>After graduating in French and English, Batley-born Ms Thompson had no particular aspirations. A careers' adviser suggested marketing; she bought an \"all you need to know\" book and started with the CWS. </p> <p>\"Marketing is a great profession. I'm very down to earth, pragmatic and straight forward. Marketing is 70% common sense and 30% flair and intuition,\" she said. </p> <p>She regards her private life as less than successful, as her career has cost her her mar riage. A single mother, she says her relationship with her 16-year-old daughter Joanna is very close. Ms Thompson insists on a close affinity to the working class despite her six figure salary and designer clothes. \"I haven't changed at all. My values haven't changed. My friends haven't changed,\" she said. She will receive champagne every year on her birthday -December 31 - as a result of winning the award.</p>",

Sacking 2,500 workers at Ratners, the troubled jeweller, is probably the moment she brandished her \"balls of steel\" most memorably. But it was for last year's high-profile fight with Sir Richard to win the second lottery licence that she beat 70 other business women to yesterday's accolade. The daughter of a butcher and a Clarks' shoe fitter, she has strived to forge a new image for Camelot since joining in 1997, moving the organisation away from the fat-cattery associated with the previous regime. After graduating in French and English, Batley-born Ms Thompson had no particular aspirations. A careers' adviser suggested marketing; she bought an \"all you need to know\" book and started with the CWS. \"Marketing is a great profession. I'm very down to earth, pragmatic and straight forward. Marketing is 70% common sense and 30% flair and intuition,\" she said. She regards her private life as less than successful, as her career has cost her her mar riage. A single mother, she says her relationship with her 16-year-old daughter Joanna is very close. Ms Thompson insists on a close affinity to the working class despite her six figure salary and designer clothes. \"I haven't changed at all. My values haven't changed. My friends haven't changed,\" she said. She will receive champagne every year on her birthday -December 31 - as a result of winning the award.",

Reports that talks had collapsed sent BioChem's shares down 12% at one point yesterday, while Shire's jumped 30p to \u00a311.40. </p> <p>Sources close to the two companies insisted last night that talks were still on track, with an update due alongside Shire's quarterly results today.

      "bodyText": "There was growing anger in the financial markets about the handling of Shire Pharmaceuticals' merger with Canadian firm BioChem yesterday, after rumours of a breakdown in talks triggered a lurch in the two companies' shares. The \u00a35bn deal, which was supposed to be completed last month, has been delayed by the Canadian government. Reports that talks had collapsed sent BioChem's shares down 12% at one point yesterday, while Shire's jumped 30p to \u00a311.40. Sources close to the two companies insisted last night that talks were still on track, with an update due alongside Shire's quarterly results today. A 30-day review period is likely to be extended.

      "body": "<p>In bright spring weather, Amsterdam's canal-side cafes proved tempting for Europe's leading biotechnology entrepreneurs, in town this week for the annual Bio-Deal conference. The mood among delegates was relaxed - there were even some attempts at jokes. Michael Ade, director of German company Ingenium, recited the names of his firm's menagerie of deformed mice - Sumo was genetically altered to be vastly overweight, while \"Arnold mighty mouse\" and \"Claudia beauty mouse\" were luckier recipients of Ingenium's gene fiddling. </p> <p>\"These are murine Adams and Eves,\" he said. \"If you take the Bible literally, those two are the first examples of cloning.\" </p> <p>Such quips are not to everyone's taste. The public is deeply sceptical, if not angry, about using animals as drugs factories, and biotech is struggling to win popular approval generally. In a Eurobarometer survey last year, only 41% of the 16,000 people polled agreed that biotech would improve the quality of life over the next 20 years. </p> <p> Those within the industry are in confident form, however, having enjoyed unprecedented success in 2000. Ernst &amp; Young's annual snapshot of life sciences, published yesterday, calculates that European biotech raised \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34bn) last year, against \u20ac1.1bn in 1999, and the total capitalisation of public companies in the sector leapt 108% to \u20ac75bn. </p> <p>\"European biotech had a great year in 2000,\" says the report's lead author Glenn Crocker. \"Every record which could have been broken has been broken. </p> <p>\"We have now got a fundamentally sound industry, with a set of companies which are actually delivering products - which is, of course, what they're there for.\" </p> <p><strong> Setting the pace</strong><br> </p> <p> Britain is setting the pace, accounting for five of the continent's top 10 biotech companies. Celltech and Shire are in the FTSE 100 index, producing both medicines and profits. Of Europe's 105 public biotech companies, 48 are in Britain. Germany has a larger number of private companies but most of these are small, early-stage enterprises. </p> <p>Last year's surge was driven by enthusiasm about the human genome project, which mapped the body's genetic structure for the first time. Biotech also gained on the back of the dot.com boom, as anything hi-tech became fashionable. The recent downturn in the stock market has depressed valuations, although biotech has suffered less than internet enterprise. </p> <p>Despite this healthy picture, alarm bells are just beginning to ring. There is increasing concern that US biotechnology is pulling away from Europe's. Mr Crocker says: \"By and large, you could have an almost identical biotech company, and it will be valued at almost twice as much in the US as in Europe.\" </p> <p>In the conference hall at Amsterdam's luxury Krasnopolsky Hotel, overlooking the city's Dam Square, there was an audible intake of breath when one British firm, Vertex, mentioned that it had more than $700m (\u00a3476) cash in the bank after choosing to float in New York, rather than London. </p> <p>\"We're an Oxbridge company,\" explained vice-president Iain Buchanan. \"We're based in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Oxford, in the UK.\" </p> <p>Vertex's bank balance outstrips the wildest dreams of its European rivals. America is operating on a different scale - one US firm, Amgen, which has made a fortune from kidney drug Epogen, is capitalised at more than \u20ac70bn - as much as the entire European biotech industry. </p> <p>In order to bridge this vast transatlantic gap, European firms are keen to form alliances, gaining strength in numbers and critical mass. This week's Bio-Deal conference was typical - executives took turns to give 25-minute presentations showcasing their products and technology, in the hope that someone in the room may be a compatible partner. </p> <p><strong> Antibodies</strong><br> </p> <p> British firm KS Biomedix was first up, detailing its method of capturing antibodies from sheep, while Pharmagene explained its technique of testing drugs in human tissue, rather than using animals. </p> <p>A German company, Micromet, then explained its \"Bites\" - bispecific t-cell engagers, which activate helpful t-cells in the blood in the area of cancer tumours. \"Bites promise to reshape immunotherapy,\" said vice-president Christian Itin. </p> <p>Some companies were explicit in their needs - gene therapy specialist Austrian Nordic declared that it wanted a partner to inject precisely \u20ac9.7m. Thrombogenics, which takes advantage of Belgian government grants because it carries out research in Flemish-speaking areas, urged someone to step forward to fund phase-three trials of its drug for heart attacks. </p> <p>Nearly every speaker kept to the conference's 25-minute limit for presentations - a reflection, according to one delegate, of increasing professionalism in the industry. </p> <p>There were few questions from the floor, because the real business of the event was behind closed doors - in a corridor of \"partnering rooms\", where executives could meet in private to thrash out deals. </p> <p>Most companies can boast a relatively healthy financial position, having taken advantage of last year's boom to raise funds from investors. Ernst &amp; Young reckons 60% of firms have at least four years' cash in the bank, while 87% have at least 12 months' money. </p> <p>This means they can be selective, with less need to sell their science to multinational pharmaceutical corporations. Biotech pundit Mike Ward says: \"The reasons people are looking for partners are much less defensive. The desperate need for cash is no longer there - it's more strategic.\" One delegate commented: \"A year ago, the attitude was that any old deal would do the job. Now, people can afford to be more discerning.\" </p> <p>The number of tie-ups between biotech companies leapt 41% to 539 last year - including 54 mergers or acquisitions, and 403 strategic alliances. Yet for many in the industry, that is still not enough. </p> <p>Mr Crocker suggests that the only way for Europe to reach a level comparable to the US would be to form a hi-tech stock market along the lines of New York's Nasdaq. The continental equivalent, Easdaq, has failed to take off. </p> <p>He says: \"Pooling resources has got to be the way forward. Europe is far too fragmented. </p> <p>\"There are some people who might ask whether it matters that the US is extending its lead. It certainly matters to governments, and it matters to employees.\" </p> <p>One of Britain's best known biotech entrepreneurs, Sir Chris Evans, shares that concern. He told the Institute of Directors in London yesterday that there was no reason why Britain could not catch up with the US - but it would take at least 20 years. \"We have got a quality of science that is on par with America but what they have is a huge venture capital community, entrepreneurial management and a fantastically vibrant stock market in Nasdaq,\" he said. </p> <p><strong> Dot.com bubble</strong><br> </p> <p> Venture capital firms in the US were ploughing in two to three times as much cash at ever stage of development: \"While our companies might raise $70m they will raise $470m at one go.\" </p> <p>Now chairman of the incubator Merlin Bioscience, Sir Chris complained of the British view that biotech was little different from the dot.com bubble. A young broker, he said, had refused to support his plan to back a biotech venture into a dot.com shell, which had already raised \u00a340m but had no operations. The broker said that biotech was no different from internet businesses. \"That young broker did not know his arse from his elbow. I hope he is in the audience,\" he told Britain's leading directors. </p> <p>Three years ago, the biotech world was rocked by the near-collapse of British Biotech, one of the industry's standard-bearers. This year, Dolly the sheep's creator, PPL Therapeutics, faces a funding crisis. But the background is very different - this time, confidence in the industry is much less fragile.

The east African nation's health minister, professor Sam Ongeri, said Kenya has drafted a bill to allow the government to buy anti-Aids drugs because patented medicines are protected by \"unrealistic\" property rights laws and are too expensive. Kenya's decision is a direct result of the collapse of the legal attempt by 39 drug companies in the Pretoria high court to overturn a law permitting the South African government to bypass patents when there is deemed to be a health emergency or where drugs are declared \"unaffordable\". Prof Ongeri said 700 Kenyans die of Aids each day, and that 2.2m people in his country are infected with HIV. Half of Kenya's hospital beds are occupied by Aids patients. But South Africa's legal victory has also had a wider if less immediately visible impact. It is forcing governments and the drug companies to discuss how they now confront a virus that infects 25m people in sub-Saharan Africa.

The schools minister, Jacqui Smith, had earlier taken a more conciliatory tone in media interviews, until the DfEE received more information from the local education authority. Yesterday Mr Hedley said he had been faced with a \"simple choice\" between sending pupils home or bringing them together in a single class in the school hall for five days over a two week period before Easter. Mr Hedley, one of eight full-time teachers at the school, which has eight classes of around 35 pupils, admitted: \"I wouldn't say that by any stretch of the imagination this was teaching the children, it was looking after them - as 94 is rather too large a number to teach them individually.\" Kim Littlewood, whose daughter was in the expanded class, said: \"Our children are suffering ...

      "bodyText": "The American state that became a byword for racial hatred during the civil rights era has finally settled a historic class action lawsuit aimed at ending segregation in its university system. After more than 25 years of dispute, Mississippi has agreed to spend more than $500m (\u00a3350m) to help remedy the inequalities which led the US supreme court to rule nine years ago that the state continued to have a segregated university system. If the plan is accepted by a federal judge, the settlement will bring an end to a class action started 26 years ago by a group of 22 black Americans who claimed that Mississippi maintained a segregated system by giving more funds to universities that were historically attended by white students than to those attended by their black counterparts. The claim, brought by the late Jake Ayers of Glen Allen, Mississippi, was taken up by the US department of justice, which has approved the deal struck this week between state officials and the remaining plaintiffs. The agreement calls for Mississippi to spend $246m (\u00a3171m) during the next 17 years on academic programmes at three publicly funded universities - Jackson State, Alcorn State and Mississippi Valley State - where almost all the students have always been black. Another $75m (\u00a352m) will go towards capital improvements in the three colleges, with the rest of the money going to endow student scholarships and other projects, including summer programmes for struggling students. Jackson State, in the state's capital, Jackson, will get 43% of the endowment funding, compared with 28% for each of the others. \"It is not perfect but it's settled,\" Congressman Bennie Thompson, one of the plaintiffs, said. \"This document represents the best effort for resolving the desegregation of higher education in Mississippi.\" \"All we need now is the court's approval and we're done,\" Mississippi's attorney general and a key negotiator, Mike Moore, said. \"This is a very big day for us.\" \"The important agreement that we have reached with the state of Mississippi will increase access to quality educational opportunities and benefit all of Mississippi's students and citizens,\" the US attorney general, John Ashcroft, said in a statement. Mississippi's racially segregated university system captured worldwide attention in 1962 when James Meredith became the first black student to gain admission at the state's most entrenched whites-only college, the University of Mississippi, in Oxford. After weeks of resistance by Mississippi authorities, Mr Meredith was only able to register after the then US attorney general, Robert Kennedy, sent 23,000 federal troops to Oxford to enforce his entry. Despite the breakthrough, the persistence of unequal funding led Mr Ayers to bring his case in 1975, again backed by the federal government. In 1987 US district judge Neal Biggers - who must now rule on the acceptability of this week's settlement - ruled that Mississippi had done enough to end segregation. Five years later, however, the US supreme court overthrew that ruling and ordered Mississippi to remove \"all vestiges of segregation\".",

The bad news is that their saviour is British American Tobacco.</p> <p>Footlights, which 40 years ago launched the careers of the likes of Jonathan Miller, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett, later followed by most of the Monty Python team, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Emma Thompson and others, has found itself embroiled in a bitter row over the subtle tactics of the tobacco companies to get around the threatened ban on cigarette advertising.</p> <p>It was denounced by the anti-smoking campaign group Ash for falling for \"a cynical piece of PR\" by the tobacco industry.</p> <p>\"Sponsoring the Footlights is an attempt to show that BAT is a company with a sense of humour,\" said John Connolly of Action on Smoking and Health. \"They might as well put up a banner saying 'If you want to be cool and funny, then smoke'.\"</p> <p>\"I wasn't over the moon about taking tobacco money,\" the show's director, Phil Breen, said yesterday. \"None of us was. But it was that or scrap the tour, or get the cast to pay all their own costs for touring around the country, which would be ridiculous. We're not Hooray Henrys, whatever you might think. We all went to state schools, except one member of the company.\"</p> <p>Footlights was founded in 1883, but this year's tour is the 40th anniversary of Beyond the Fringe, which brought together Miller, Cook, Moore, and Bennett.</p> <p>In 1963 another gang of students with a shared sense of anarchic humour, including John Cleese, Eric Idle and Terry Jones, met at the Footlights.

      "bodyText": "Far Too Happy, the title of its latest show, does not precisely convey the atmosphere at Cambridge Footlights yesterday: sick as chain-smoking parrots might serve better. The good news is that the 40th anniversary tour of the most famous student revue company in the country has been saved by a last-minute corporate donation of \u00a325,000. The bad news is that their saviour is British American Tobacco. Footlights, which 40 years ago launched the careers of the likes of Jonathan Miller, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett, later followed by most of the Monty Python team, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Emma Thompson and others, has found itself embroiled in a bitter row over the subtle tactics of the tobacco companies to get around the threatened ban on cigarette advertising. It was denounced by the anti-smoking campaign group Ash for falling for \"a cynical piece of PR\" by the tobacco industry. \"Sponsoring the Footlights is an attempt to show that BAT is a company with a sense of humour,\" said John Connolly of Action on Smoking and Health. \"They might as well put up a banner saying 'If you want to be cool and funny, then smoke'.\" \"I wasn't over the moon about taking tobacco money,\" the show's director, Phil Breen, said yesterday. \"None of us was. But it was that or scrap the tour, or get the cast to pay all their own costs for touring around the country, which would be ridiculous. We're not Hooray Henrys, whatever you might think. We all went to state schools, except one member of the company.\" Footlights was founded in 1883, but this year's tour is the 40th anniversary of Beyond the Fringe, which brought together Miller, Cook, Moore, and Bennett. In 1963 another gang of students with a shared sense of anarchic humour, including John Cleese, Eric Idle and Terry Jones, met at the Footlights. On a US tour of the Footlights Revue they then met animator Terry Gilliam, who gave the Monty Python Show its unique graphics. The annual show has traditionally opened at the Cambridge Arts Theatre, which helped to sponsor the tour by paying for the set and publicity. Recriminations were flying yesterday, but a spokeswoman for the cash-strapped theatre said the Footlights' box office has been falling drastically over recent years, and the decision was taken to drop it. Producer Elen Parry insists the box office is fine, but said she discovered a gaping hole in the \u00a335,000 tour budget only at Christmas, and then wrote more than 200 letters appealing for sponsorship. \"It was a question of sitting down and saying 'how much are our morals and principles worth?'\" The answer was \u00a325,000.

      "bodyText": "One of Britain's leading fertility specialists vowed yesterday to appeal after a 46-year-old patient lost the latest round in her legal battle for the right to have five embryos implanted in her womb. Mohamed Taranissi, head of the private clinic where the woman has made eight unsuccessful attempts in five years to become pregnant with IVF treatment, said he and his patient would continue to campaign for the existing three-embryo limit to be relaxed in exceptional circumstances. \"She is obviously going to be very disappointed,\" said Mr Taranissi. \"She knows her chances of a successful pregnancy are not very good. If anything she'd rather help other people in the same position as herself.\" Mr Taranissi maintains that he is fighting for the right of medical practitioners to have the leeway to treat patients on a case by case basis. Yesterday, in the high court in London, Mr Justice Ouseley rejected the request by Mr Taranissi and his patient - who was referred to only as Mrs H - for a judicial review of the rules limiting the number of embryos which can be put back into a woman having IVF treatment. He said he would give his reasons today. Mr Taranissi and Mrs H were opposed in court by the human fertilisation and embryology authority, which argues that the risk of mothers having twins and triplets if more than three embryos are put back represents an unacceptable danger to the lives of children. \"We're pleased the court has struck a reasonable balance between allowing treatment where it is appropriate and the welfare of children,\" said Hugh Whittall of the HFEA. The HFEA is under pressure from the medical community to cut the maximum number of embryos put back from three to two because of the large number of multiple births in younger women. HFEA guidelines are not binding on IVF clinics. But if Mr Taranissi defied the authority and implanted the five embryos - which he believes would increase her chances of getting pregnant - the HFEA could remove his licence. Unlike other older women trying to have children with IVF treatment, Mrs H is forced to use IVF because she has blocked fallopian tubes, and is using her own rather than donor eggs. Arguing in court for a judicial review of the HFEA rules, Nigel Pleming QC said that it was irrational to suggest that a woman who had not achieved a single pregnancy with eight IVF cycles of three embryos each would have twins or triplets if five embryos were implanted. The HFEA's own figures showed that in the past seven years 250 women aged 46 had received IVF treatment in Britain and none had given birth at all, let alone to twins. In the US, where there are fewer restrictions on embryo numbers, only 2% of 46-year-olds treated had a baby. \"An increase in the chance of having a baby from zero to 2% is statistically significant, particularly in a 46-year-old woman,\" said Mr Pleming. \"It's going from no chance to some chance.\" For the HFEA, Dinah Rose accused Mr Taranissi of drawing false inferences from statistics. The authority agreed Mrs H's chances of becoming pregnant were small. But if she did become pregnant, said Miss Rose, the chances of her having a multiple pregnancy were not necessarily less than those in younger women.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's native butterfly species are suffering from loss of habitat and efforts to halt the trend have failed, according to a report published today. Following one of the largest and most comprehensive surveys of butterflies undertaken in the UK, the report concluded that of 59 resident species, 15 have declined by more than 50% and five have become extinct. The report is published by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. It revealed that even key species such as the pearl-bordered fritillary and the marsh fritillary - listed as of highest conservation priority in the UK biodiversity action plan - are still under threat. The report also showed that a further 10 species, including the wood white, now warrant highest conservation priority. The main causes of the decline include destruction and fragmentation of habitat and changing land management patterns which have left butterflies without big enough areas in which to feed, breed and survive, the report said. Ian McLean, JNCC's head of species, said: \"Butterflies are extremely sensitive to the environment on which they depend, therefore they act as excellent indicators of the health of the countryside. \"While some butterflies have extended their range northwards due to the effects of cli mate change, it is clear that there is an overall downward trend in UK butterflies, and that existing measures to try to conserve key species are not effective enough.\" He added: \"If we don't take action now to halt the present rate of decline, butterflies flying across a summer meadow may become a thing of the past.\" Richard Fox, of Butterfly Conservation and the main author of the report, said: \"This report highlights priorities vital for conservationists and policy makers to address the decline. \"It is essential that we maintain this effort to assess future changes in the state of Britain's butterflies.\" Declining species \u2022 The high brown fritillary (Argynnis adippe) - severe declines means it is now one of our rarest butterflies.

After years of humiliation at the hands of colour sergeants as a Sandhurst cadet and unruly pupils during his time as a supply teacher, the novelist can surely afford to rest on his laurels. The Hollywood-backed film of his Captain Corelli's Mandolin - the runaway bestseller of the late 90s set in wartime Cephalonia - goes on general release next week. With actors such as Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz in starring roles and a ready audience of the book's legions of enthusiasts, box office success must be all but guaranteed. </p> <p>But de Bernieres appears to have been rattled by criticism that he has played fast and loose with history, accusing his tormentors of \"trouble-making\" for investigating the truth of the cataclysmic events at the heart of his story. He no longer, he grumbles, feels \"entirely comfortable or welcome\" on the Greek island whose tourist industry he has done so much to boost. In fact, he has had to put up with so much \"brainless and trivial embuggerance\", he says, that he has come to regret having written Corelli in the first place. </p> <p>So far, the attacks have mainly focused on his historical howlers about the Greek anti-Nazi resistance. His novel is the story of a love affair between the daughter of a Cephalonian doctor and a captain in the Italian occupation army, who helps turn his troops against the Germans and survives the subsequent massacre of 9,000 of them. But woven into the human drama is a ferociously hostile account of the role played by the communist-led guerrilla army, who later fought British and American-backed forces in the civil war and are portrayed by de Bernieres as a gang of torturers and rapists. </p> <p>According to Wehr-macht records, the leftwing resistance killed 8,000 German soldiers in one year and controlled 80% of the country when Hitler withdrew. But de Bernieres, a self- confessed sympathiser with Greece's prewar dictator Metaxas - a man who imprisoned and murdered thousands of political activists, but opposed Mussolini - insists the partisans did \"absolutely nothing\". Not surprisingly, when such claims percolated through to Greek veterans, there was uproar and de Bernieres was persuaded to drop the most extreme passages from the Greek edition of his book. </p> <p>The Corelli film's own scriptwriter Shawn Slovo has since publicly dismissed his portrait of the Greek resistance as \"offensive and inaccurate\" and the movie shows the partisans fighting alongside the Italians in Cephalonia - something de Bernieres insists in the novel against all the evidence is \"certain\" not to have happened. Even de Bernieres has reluctantly conceded he \"might have been wrong\", but always stops short of an outright admission of error. </p> <p>In any case, he now seems more concerned by the challenge to his story posed by the man increasingly accepted as the \"real Captain Corelli\", 90-year-old Florentine Amos Pampaloni and star of a BBC2 documentary due to be broadcast next month. Pampaloni's experience uncannily mirrors that of de Bernieres's hero. Like Corelli, Pampaloni was a captain in the 33rd artillery regiment, Acqui division, on Cephalonia - in fact he was the only one. Like Corelli, he had an affair with a local girl and played a central role in the decision to attack German troops. Like Corelli, he was shot and left for dead after the Italian defeat. But unlike Corelli, Pampaloni went on to fight with the Greek resistance and calls de Bernieres's tales of the partisans' depravity a \"pack of lies\". </p> <p>The novelist insists Pampaloni was not his model and blames journalists who \"cannot conceive of authors being able to invent\". De Bernieres himself cites a 60s Italian novel, The White Flag by Marcello Venturi (which is explicitly based on Pampaloni's story), as a source in his own book's list of acknowledgements. De Bernieres's central plot is notably similar to Venturi's - an artillery captain on Cephalonia has an affair with a Greek girl, then becomes engulfed in the German- Italian confrontation of 1943 and survives the subsequent massacres - and he even uses a couple of names Venturi invented, including his pseudonym for Pampaloni, Aldo Pugliesi. </p> <p>Corelli is nevertheless a much longer and more ambitious novel; there is no suggestion of textual copying and de Bernieres says he had already decided on the bare bones of his story when he read The White Flag. But Venturi, who is highly critical of de Bernieres's version of the Cephalonian events, is also angry at what he sees as inadequate recognition and yesterday said he was consulting lawyers about the possibility of legal action.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is an odd, angular little house, perched above the village of Montfort-l'Amaury like the prow of a ship or, as a mischievous-minded pupil once put it, a badly-cut slice of Camembert. Maurice Ravel bought it with the aid of an inheritance in 1921, did it up at no little expense - it had neither running water nor electricity - and decorated it to his taste, which is to say meticulously and almost mathematically, if rather eclectically. </p> <p>The composer loved it because it was close enough by train to Paris to allow him to indulge his liking for bright lights and the big city, but at the same time calm and secluded, within a short ride of Rambouillet forest where he walked when his work and the weather permitted. </p> <p>Possibly the world's most frequently performed piece of classical music was written in this house, in 1928. Composed in haste for a dancer friend, Ravel's Bolero has been used in countless ad campaigns, by Torvill and Dean for their perfect gold medal performance at the 1984 Winter Olympics, and equally memorably as the accompaniment to the rhythmic writhings of Dudley Moore and Bo Derek in 10. </p> <p>Bolero - which Ravel insisted reflected his fascination for the well-oiled pounding of heavy machinery, but in which others have seen a \"veritable hymn to desire\" and an \"exaltation of the erotic\" - is, apparently, played somewhere in the world every 15 minutes. It has been one of France's top three musical exports, classical and contemporary combined, for decades. </p> <p>Tugged along by its insistent theme, repeated 18 times and cited by at least one psychologist as evidence that the composer was suffering from Alzheimer's, Ravel's oeuvre has generated literally millions of pounds in rights. Most of his work will not be in the public domain until around 2015; it currently brings in around \u00a31.5m per year - at a rough estimate, \u00a340m to date. </p> <p>What Claude Moreau would like to know is where all that money goes. </p> <p>The composer's house, Belvedere, is open to visitors most afternoons; 3,000 make the pilgrimage every year. Moreau, the sprightly curator, shows them round its tiny interior (Ravel was just over 5ft 1in tall) and lets them admire his rosewood piano and stare at the bric-a-brac with which the composer, a compulsive collector, filled his glass-fronted cabinets. </p> <p>The house is more or less as he left it on his death, during brain surgery in 1937 to tackle the degenerative disease from which he had suffered for a decade. It is full of surprises, from Dadaist teacups with holes in the bottom to a porcelain ashtray bearing the words: \"Who burnt my table-cloth?\" </p> <p>But there are other, less joyful surprises. The carpets are rotting and threadbare, the silk curtains disintegrating, the ceilings cracked. The pipes burst years ago and downstairs, in Ravel's bedroom, water damage has wrecked the handpainted wallpaper and left bulging, crumbled masonry. The electricity isn't up to scratch and the whole house needs a new roof. </p> <p>It wouldn't take much money to put it right; probably quite a bit less than what Bolero alone earns in a year. But with all that rights money washing around, the French national museum service doesn't want to pay. Nor, sadly, do the recipients of all that rights money - who are not at all who you might expect them to be. And in the meantime, Belvedere rots. </p> <p>The story of the missing Bolero millions is one of the greatest artists' rights sagas in history. It is a tangled tale, with all the right ingredients: manipulative confidants, machiavellian machinations, a rewritten will and scheming lawyers. </p> <p>It starts with the death of Ravelito, as his close friend, the writer Colette, called him. Unmarried and childless, the composer left everything to his brother Edouard, who turned the house at Montfort-l'Amaury into a museum, with - a nice detail, this - Celeste Albaret, who had been housekeeper to no less than Marcel Proust, as its rather idiosyncratic concierge. All seemed in good hands until the day in 1954 when Edouard and his wife were involved in a horrendous car accident. In need of constant help, the couple engaged Jeanne Taverne, a 48-year-old nurse, and her husband Alexandre, a former miner and barber, who acted as their chauffeur. When Edouard's wife died two years later, the Tavernes moved in, never to leave. </p> <p>In 1957, Edouard Ravel made a rare trip to Paris for the 20th anniversary of his brother's death. To universal satisfaction, he announced his intention of making over 80% of the composer's rights to the city of Paris, with the idea of endowing a Nobel Prize for music. </p> <p>But once back home, for reasons no one will now ever know but that can be guessed at, he changed his mind: Jeanne Taverne became his sole inheritor. Not even the pleas of Ravel's long-standing publisher, Ren\u00e9 Dommange of the Durand publishing house, that the rights should be used \"for the good of French music\", could persuade Edouard to change his mind. </p> <p>Watching these sordid manoeuvrings with interest, meanwhile, was Jean-Jacques Lemoine, legal director of Sacem, the French organisation responsible for collecting and distributing authors', composers' and publishers' rights. Lemoine knew very well how much Ravel was worth: he was Sacem's single biggest earner. </p> <p>Edouard died in 1960, unleashing a bitter legal battle between the Tavernes and Ravel's relatives in Switzerland, where his father was born. For the duration of the case, which dragged on for 10 years and ended up in France's highest appeal court, Lemoine astutely froze all the money entering Sacem's Ravel account. </p> <p> So it was that, in 1970, when the last appeal judge ruled in Alexandre Taverne's favour, Jeanne having died six years earlier, the former miner picked up \u00a33.6m. At around that time, Lemoine resigned unexpectedly from Sacem and founded a private legal practice. His first client? One Alexandre Taverne. </p> <p>Not content with the \u00a33.6m of accumulated composer's rights, Taverne and Lemoine now set about collaring a portion of the publisher's rights, too. This they did by taking Dommange to court and demanding the rewriting of his original contracts with Ravel, which mostly gave the publisher 75% of the rights from recordings rather than the customary one-third. </p> <p>Dommange, by then in his 80s, had no stomach for the fight and soon sold out. Taverne, who had since remarried, got his hands on all the Ravel contracts and began drawing up new ones with Lemoine; these covered, among other things, the division of rights due on recordings of Ravel's works. Lemoine set up a company, Artist's Rights International Management Agency, or Arima, specifically for the purpose. </p> <p>Then, in 1972, in a move that has never been fully explained, Alexandre and Georgette Taverne assigned a portion of their composer's and publisher's rights to Arima. Nobody knows how much: both Georgette, now nearly 80 and living near Montreux, and Lemoine, over 90 and living in Monaco, have refused to discuss the matter, though Georgette's daughter told Le Point magazine last year: \"Neither my mother or I have received a penny of Ravel's rights for a very long time - everything was made over to Lemoine at the beginning of the 1970s.\" He is, the family says, the sole recipient of ill-gotten cash worth at least \u00a330m over the past 25 years. </p> <p>One man disputes this, saying the Tavernes are still benefiting handsomely from Ravel's talent. But he has a sizeable axe to grind: Jean-Manuel de Scarano was the proprietor of Ravel's publishers, Durand, from 1982 until last year, when he sold out to Bertelsmann. The sale price, reportedly \u00a313.5m, no doubt reflected Scarano's achievement, as president of the French music publishers' association, in persuading the government to extend from 50 to 70 years the period for which compositions are protected by copyright - plus an extra 15 years to account for two world wars. The day that bill became law, in 1995, Durand became worth an awful lot more money. Quite how much more is hard to say, of course, without knowing precisely what was in those Taverne-Arima-Durand contracts signed in the 1970s. </p> <p>Scarano insists the 1972 assignment of copyright simply entailed the Tavernes making over to Arima 50% of Ravel's publishing rights. \"Arima,\" he says, \"is the joint publisher, with Durand, of all Ravel's works. It's quite normal.\" </p> <p>It is, of course, anything but normal. Why did the Tavernes make over half their publisher's rights to Arima, and in exchange for what? How much was left for Durand? And just what is Arima? Based in Gibraltar and later in the British Virgin Islands, Arima's shareholders are three companies - Dunsmoor Ltd, Greenford Holdings and Anglo Swiss Directors Ltd - about which nobody seems to know anything. </p> <p>So that's the deal, it seems, with the Bolero millions. The descendants of Maurice Ravel's brother's nurse may still have their hands on some of them, though there is no way to know for sure. On the other hand, it looks almost certain that the former legal eagle at the French music rights association, hiding behind a string of paper companies, has enriched himself by around \u00a31.5m per year for the past 30 years. </p> <p>Standing on the balcony of the composer's house last week, Claude Moreau gazed mournfully at the green fields beyond Montfort-l'Amaury church and swore charmingly. She hasn't the money to mend the curtains, the carpets or the roof. \"It's scandalous,\" she says, \"an insult to Ravel's memory. We haven't a centime and if we don't get some, it will soon be too late.\"</p>",

Maurice Ravel bought it with the aid of an inheritance in 1921, did it up at no little expense - it had neither running water nor electricity - and decorated it to his taste, which is to say meticulously and almost mathematically, if rather eclectically. The composer loved it because it was close enough by train to Paris to allow him to indulge his liking for bright lights and the big city, but at the same time calm and secluded, within a short ride of Rambouillet forest where he walked when his work and the weather permitted. Possibly the world's most frequently performed piece of classical music was written in this house, in 1928. Composed in haste for a dancer friend, Ravel's Bolero has been used in countless ad campaigns, by Torvill and Dean for their perfect gold medal performance at the 1984 Winter Olympics, and equally memorably as the accompaniment to the rhythmic writhings of Dudley Moore and Bo Derek in 10. Bolero - which Ravel insisted reflected his fascination for the well-oiled pounding of heavy machinery, but in which others have seen a \"veritable hymn to desire\" and an \"exaltation of the erotic\" - is, apparently, played somewhere in the world every 15 minutes. It has been one of France's top three musical exports, classical and contemporary combined, for decades. Tugged along by its insistent theme, repeated 18 times and cited by at least one psychologist as evidence that the composer was suffering from Alzheimer's, Ravel's oeuvre has generated literally millions of pounds in rights. Most of his work will not be in the public domain until around 2015; it currently brings in around \u00a31.5m per year - at a rough estimate, \u00a340m to date. What Claude Moreau would like to know is where all that money goes. The composer's house, Belvedere, is open to visitors most afternoons; 3,000 make the pilgrimage every year. Moreau, the sprightly curator, shows them round its tiny interior (Ravel was just over 5ft 1in tall) and lets them admire his rosewood piano and stare at the bric-a-brac with which the composer, a compulsive collector, filled his glass-fronted cabinets. The house is more or less as he left it on his death, during brain surgery in 1937 to tackle the degenerative disease from which he had suffered for a decade. It is full of surprises, from Dadaist teacups with holes in the bottom to a porcelain ashtray bearing the words: \"Who burnt my table-cloth?\" But there are other, less joyful surprises. The carpets are rotting and threadbare, the silk curtains disintegrating, the ceilings cracked. The pipes burst years ago and downstairs, in Ravel's bedroom, water damage has wrecked the handpainted wallpaper and left bulging, crumbled masonry. The electricity isn't up to scratch and the whole house needs a new roof. It wouldn't take much money to put it right; probably quite a bit less than what Bolero alone earns in a year. But with all that rights money washing around, the French national museum service doesn't want to pay. Nor, sadly, do the recipients of all that rights money - who are not at all who you might expect them to be. And in the meantime, Belvedere rots. The story of the missing Bolero millions is one of the greatest artists' rights sagas in history. It is a tangled tale, with all the right ingredients: manipulative confidants, machiavellian machinations, a rewritten will and scheming lawyers. It starts with the death of Ravelito, as his close friend, the writer Colette, called him. Unmarried and childless, the composer left everything to his brother Edouard, who turned the house at Montfort-l'Amaury into a museum, with - a nice detail, this - Celeste Albaret, who had been housekeeper to no less than Marcel Proust, as its rather idiosyncratic concierge. All seemed in good hands until the day in 1954 when Edouard and his wife were involved in a horrendous car accident. In need of constant help, the couple engaged Jeanne Taverne, a 48-year-old nurse, and her husband Alexandre, a former miner and barber, who acted as their chauffeur. When Edouard's wife died two years later, the Tavernes moved in, never to leave. In 1957, Edouard Ravel made a rare trip to Paris for the 20th anniversary of his brother's death. To universal satisfaction, he announced his intention of making over 80% of the composer's rights to the city of Paris, with the idea of endowing a Nobel Prize for music. But once back home, for reasons no one will now ever know but that can be guessed at, he changed his mind: Jeanne Taverne became his sole inheritor. Not even the pleas of Ravel's long-standing publisher, Ren\u00e9 Dommange of the Durand publishing house, that the rights should be used \"for the good of French music\", could persuade Edouard to change his mind. Watching these sordid manoeuvrings with interest, meanwhile, was Jean-Jacques Lemoine, legal director of Sacem, the French organisation responsible for collecting and distributing authors', composers' and publishers' rights. Lemoine knew very well how much Ravel was worth: he was Sacem's single biggest earner. Edouard died in 1960, unleashing a bitter legal battle between the Tavernes and Ravel's relatives in Switzerland, where his father was born. For the duration of the case, which dragged on for 10 years and ended up in France's highest appeal court, Lemoine astutely froze all the money entering Sacem's Ravel account. So it was that, in 1970, when the last appeal judge ruled in Alexandre Taverne's favour, Jeanne having died six years earlier, the former miner picked up \u00a33.6m. At around that time, Lemoine resigned unexpectedly from Sacem and founded a private legal practice. His first client? One Alexandre Taverne. Not content with the \u00a33.6m of accumulated composer's rights, Taverne and Lemoine now set about collaring a portion of the publisher's rights, too. This they did by taking Dommange to court and demanding the rewriting of his original contracts with Ravel, which mostly gave the publisher 75% of the rights from recordings rather than the customary one-third. Dommange, by then in his 80s, had no stomach for the fight and soon sold out. Taverne, who had since remarried, got his hands on all the Ravel contracts and began drawing up new ones with Lemoine; these covered, among other things, the division of rights due on recordings of Ravel's works. Lemoine set up a company, Artist's Rights International Management Agency, or Arima, specifically for the purpose. Then, in 1972, in a move that has never been fully explained, Alexandre and Georgette Taverne assigned a portion of their composer's and publisher's rights to Arima. Nobody knows how much: both Georgette, now nearly 80 and living near Montreux, and Lemoine, over 90 and living in Monaco, have refused to discuss the matter, though Georgette's daughter told Le Point magazine last year: \"Neither my mother or I have received a penny of Ravel's rights for a very long time - everything was made over to Lemoine at the beginning of the 1970s.\" He is, the family says, the sole recipient of ill-gotten cash worth at least \u00a330m over the past 25 years. One man disputes this, saying the Tavernes are still benefiting handsomely from Ravel's talent. But he has a sizeable axe to grind: Jean-Manuel de Scarano was the proprietor of Ravel's publishers, Durand, from 1982 until last year, when he sold out to Bertelsmann. The sale price, reportedly \u00a313.5m, no doubt reflected Scarano's achievement, as president of the French music publishers' association, in persuading the government to extend from 50 to 70 years the period for which compositions are protected by copyright - plus an extra 15 years to account for two world wars. The day that bill became law, in 1995, Durand became worth an awful lot more money. Quite how much more is hard to say, of course, without knowing precisely what was in those Taverne-Arima-Durand contracts signed in the 1970s. Scarano insists the 1972 assignment of copyright simply entailed the Tavernes making over to Arima 50% of Ravel's publishing rights. \"Arima,\" he says, \"is the joint publisher, with Durand, of all Ravel's works. It's quite normal.\" It is, of course, anything but normal. Why did the Tavernes make over half their publisher's rights to Arima, and in exchange for what? How much was left for Durand? And just what is Arima? Based in Gibraltar and later in the British Virgin Islands, Arima's shareholders are three companies - Dunsmoor Ltd, Greenford Holdings and Anglo Swiss Directors Ltd - about which nobody seems to know anything. So that's the deal, it seems, with the Bolero millions. The descendants of Maurice Ravel's brother's nurse may still have their hands on some of them, though there is no way to know for sure. On the other hand, it looks almost certain that the former legal eagle at the French music rights association, hiding behind a string of paper companies, has enriched himself by around \u00a31.5m per year for the past 30 years. Standing on the balcony of the composer's house last week, Claude Moreau gazed mournfully at the green fields beyond Montfort-l'Amaury church and swore charmingly. She hasn't the money to mend the curtains, the carpets or the roof. \"It's scandalous,\" she says, \"an insult to Ravel's memory. We haven't a centime and if we don't get some, it will soon be too late.\"",

Now it likes to present itself as the listening bank, closer to the people and countries it was set up to encourage towards democracy and the market economy. So, 10 years on, has the bank proved its worth? </p> <p>First, remember the context in which the EBRD was set up: the Berlin wall had been smashed into pieces before the world's media. Communist regimes across central and eastern Europe had tumbled - some quickly, others more reluctantly and violently - in the face of popular protest. The predominant emotion was euphoria. </p> <p>Little wonder western politicians decided the brave new world needed a new style bank. Hence the EBRD with its mandate to encourage democracy; to use public funds yet focus on the private sector; to stick to sound banking principles while taking risks at which commercial bankers jibbed. </p> <p>In the hothouse atmosphere of 1990/91 it would have been surprising if the bank had not raised expectations that would be difficult to meet, not least within its own London headquarters. The scale of the task was simply enormous. Take Russia: 70 years of communism, no entrepreneurial tradition, no vestige of the structures without which a market economy cannot survive. In some cases not even the basic infrastructure to get food to market. </p> <p>The EBRD certainly got off to a bad start. Its first president, Jacques Attali, had a grandiose vision of the bank's role. But his presidency became bogged down in controversy (forever encapsulated by the row over the decision to remarble the EBRD's halls at a reported cost of \u00a3750,000). Early scandals aside, however, the bank has functioned with increasing effectiveness. It has lent some \u20ac17.5bn of its own money and helped bring in further \u20ac44.5bn from other investors. Its investment portfolio amounts to \u20ac12bn. According to President Jean Lemierre the bank can now lend \u20ac3.4bn a year - without having to ask its shareholders for more money. </p> <p>Nor should its psychological impact be underestimated. The bank has continued to lend money and to persuade others to do so long after the initial euphoria has turned to disappointment in both east and west. The Russian debt crisis in 1998 forced it to draw in its horns but did not drive it away. </p> <p>But the bank's influence must not be overstated either. It may account for 9% of all foreign direct investment in central and eastern Europe but its resources pale to insignificance compared with the \u00a3153bn of German tax payers' money that has poured into the old East Germany. </p> <p>The bank has also had to change its approach. Where once it may have adapted a top down approach to both political reform and economic development it has increasingly looked to bolster the transition process - both economic and political - through the creation of a new class of entrepreneurs. </p> <p>It still goes eyeball to eyeball with the big players, tying the prospect of lending to reform, transparency and good governance. Belarus has been warned the taps could be turned off over concerns about fair elections. Gaz-prom's application for money met with a list of questions. No answers, no money. </p> <p>By contrast loans to small businesses either directly or through EBRD backed banks now total $800m covering 100,000 projects - that is up from 50,000 loans and $250m a year earlier. </p> <p>The task remains formidable. On the plus side a number of countries are now preparing for accession to the European Union. The EBRD now reckons the banking sectors in Poland and Hungary can function without its help. </p> <p>The pattern however is, at best, uneven. Last year was the first since the bank was set up where not one of the countries within which the EBRD operates saw its economy contract in real terms. Many are still below the level of 1989 - in some cases dramatically so. In Moldova, for example, per capita gross domestic product is less than $1 a day. In the UK it is around $65. Even allowing for the fact that a $1 will buy more in Chisenau than London the disparity is still enormous. In Russia life expectancy (the most relevant of all benchmarks) has actually fallen over the past decade. As the EBRD's chairman, Laurent Fabius, observed at the bank's annual meeting this week: \"There can hardly be any prospect of sustainable growth if the population is in decline.\" </p> <p>Even where prosperity has increased not everyone has shared in the benefits. As new enterprises and institutions have been built others have fallen away. Thousands have been left without jobs. Those on pensions have seen their value reduced to next to nothing. In some of the countries of former Yugoslavia war has left its particular legacy with a knock-on effect elsewhere in the Balkans. </p> <p>The bank's mandate does not run, directly, to social issues such as poverty, health and education. With the benefit of hindsight that looks a mistake. But there are signs it is working more closely with other international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to address crucial social issues. </p> <p>The EBRD believes firmly that the linkage embodied in its statutes between between economic reform and democracy has been proved beyond doubt over the last 10 years.

Applications that address the themes and priorities of BBSRC's scientific committees can be made at any time, but dates for calls for application are located at the relevant sections of the BBSRC website. The BBSRC has six funding schemes. Research grants BBSRC research grants are intended to provide researchers with support for research projects of timeliness and promise in which the principal applicant(s) will be personally involved. Grants are usually awarded for three years, and are categorised under the following framework: Responsive research grants Purpose: Awarded in response to unsolicited research proposals in any area relevant to BBSRC's mission. Deadline: 5 March 2001 for the June 2001 round. Responsive research initiatives These involve a call for proposals in a specific area with one or two closing dates. Thematic research Responsive research initiatives which have been opened to a wider range of institutions than normal LINK Scheme Collaborative research with industry to accelerate the commercial exploitation of government funded pre-competitive research and to focus on advances in science and engineering with particular commercial promise. There are a number of ways a researcher can apply to these four categories, including joint research projects, collaborative projects, joint research council/MOD funding, access to national facilities, and the \"New Investigators\" scheme. Studentships and training BBSRC offers support for any research training relevant to its mission and the needs of its research, industrial and educational communities. This includes: Three-year studentships which can be: \u0095 Research studentships: an opportunity for graduates to receive three years training in research, research methods and employment-related skills. \u0095 Cooperative awards in science and engineering (CASE): Joint supervision by a member of an eligible academic institution and an employee of the cooperating industrial company.

Specially trained officers are pursuing leads alleging that violence and serious criminal damage was committed by children and teenagers when rumours about a marauding gang of white youths swept the Lidget Green area. West Yorkshire police have a tally of 96 separate reported crimes, including a vicious attack on a passing driver. Julie Cook, 38, had been visiting relatives in Bradford when a brick was thrown through her windscreen. She left hospital yesterday after eye surgery. Two pubs were seriously damaged in the four hours of street fighting - \"revenge\" attacks by Asian youths - triggered when members of a white group made racist comments about a Hindu engagement party. Officers took video film of the fighting. Three men arrested during the trouble were freed on police bail.",

His comments came as official figures published today revealed that the government had failed to meet its target of 12,000 last year. However, Mr Straw said: \"The target for this year is 30,000.\" He said the government's new target was backed up by investment in 1,500 extra immigration officers to work as arrest squads. And the Home Office will be using more chartered aircraft to repatriate unsuccessful asylum seekers. However, Home Office officials later confirmed it will be very difficult to return applicants from Iran and Iraq, who make up a large proportion of the number of asylum applications received in the UK, because direct flights are not possible from British airports. Mr Straw said that many refugees also leave the country voluntarily after they have exhausted their rights of appeal. The new target will comprise of 24,000 asylum seekers and 6,000 of their spouses, children and other dependants, he said. Asked if the target was achievable, the home secretary said: \"I think we will get there, but we can never be certain.\" About 700 immigration officers have already been trained and are in place to act as arrest teams and they will be joined by 1,500 more, Mr Straw said. However, he criticised Conservative plans to detain every single asylum seeker in secure camps as \"impractical, inhumane and expensive\". Mr Straw said new electronic fingerprinting technology at ports, airports and other centres across the UK have already led to 89 arrests and 44 convictions of bogus applicants. The latest phase of this technology was being rolled out this week he added. The home secretary also discussed the possibility of the UK having to change its rules on who qualifies for asylum and who does not under a draft EU directive being published later this year. It is widely expected that the UK will be required to narrow its definition to exclude people who have been persecuted in non-government-backed incidents. The UK currently allows asylum on the grounds of rape, domestic violence and other acts not sponsored by other governments for example. Other EU countries do not allow such claims. \"Some European countries have narrower definitions in some respects and some have the same or wider,\" said Mr Straw. \"It's a very varied picture. \"What we think is important is that there should be a level picture so we have similar definitions which apply across Europe. \"What I suspect is that under the EU directive we will have common standards. But I can't say whether ours will go up or down. \"I am sure they will change in some respects but we have to have changes across Europe.\" The Home Office also announced today that there was a provisional 2% drop in asylum applications during the financial year 2000/01. The figure up to the end of March was 74,850 and the backlog of undecided claims was the lowest in the decade. Figures also revealed the number of asylum applications rose slightly in March, compared with February, but it was still 13% lower than for the same period last year. Last month, 1,700 people were granted asylum or 9% of the 18,895 decisions made by immigration officials. But applicants also made a record number of appeals. Nearly 11,000 appeals were submitted and 490 of them were granted asylum by the Immigration Appellate Authority.

A predominantly right-sided midfielder, Dyer can also play in central midfield or attack. He made an immediate impact on Tyneside after his \u00a36m move from Ipswich in July 1999 but has been out since February this year after an operation on his shin. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "trailText": "<p><strong>The precautionary approach to parenting</strong></p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>The precautionary approach to parenting</strong></p> <p> Parental paranoia today is more than simply a worse version of past anxieties. For instance, a common target of child-rearing manuals before the Second World War was the over-protective parent, and guilt-ridden parents worried that they might be 'smothering' their children. But how many times do we hear parents criticized for being over-protective today? Indeed, many of the traits associated with the classic over-protective father or mother are likely to be praised by today's child experts as responsible parenting. Parents are continually urged to do even more to protect their children.</p> <p> Researchers advise parents to supervise children, not only outdoors, but even when they watch television. The term 'coviewing' has been coined to describe the practice of hands-on parents playing the role of a 'media value filter and a media educator'. Other researchers further, claim that parental supervision inoculates children from many of the dangers they face. They contend that 'parental monitoring has been inversely associated with antisocial behaviour, drug use, tobacco use and early sexual activity'. There is obviously some truth in this. The more time a child spends in the company of his or her parents the less time is available for smoking, drinking and sex. But to equate the amount of parental supervision directly with behavioural outcomes tells parents that the more time they manage to spend with their children, the better their offspring will be. This raises the question of where to draw the line. How do parents decide how much monitoring is reasonably required, as opposed to optimally possible?</p> <p> Unfortunately, parental supervision is today always interpreted as a positive virtue so parents can never spend too much time supervising their youngsters. Child-rearing experts occasionally concede that it is simply impossible to keep children and young teenagers under constant adult supervision. But even then they insist that alternative, indirect, forms of child surveillance are employed. One American expert argues that if a child has to be left under self-care, then parents must do whatever they can to supervise in absentia, by liaising with a trusted adult who knows what the youngster is up to. The message is clear: if you are going to shirk your responsibility towards your child even for a few hours, you must at least make sure that somebody else is doing your job for you.</p> <p> Parents are not just advised to supervise their children. In Britain, such advice contains the implicit threat of legal sanction. Although in England and Wales there is no statutory age at which it is illegal to leave your children unattended, a parent who is deemed to neglect, abandon or expose her children to danger can be liable to prosecution. According to Carolyn Hamilton of the Children's Legal Centre, the general view taken by child protection professionals is that a parent should not leave children under 12 alone for more than 20-30 minutes. What a shock this would have been to the parents of 'latch-key' youngsters in the 1970s. At that time debate about the children of working mothers returning from school to empty homes focused on whether it was right for women to have jobs which deprived their children of a welcoming smile and the smell of home baking. The issue was not seen as one of child safety and certainly not abandonment. Yet today's legal experts advise that, while parents are unlikely to face prosecution for a 30-minute absence, the parent of an 11-year-old left alone for three to four hours might face legal action. Even though very few parents are prosecuted in these circumstances, the strict guidelines convey a clear message about what society expects of parents. And that expectation is founded on the premise that parents can never do too much to protect their children.</p> <p> Twenty or thirty years ago, authors of child-rearing manuals had their own way of making parents feel guilty. But they would have reacted with disbelief to the proposition that it was wrong to leave children under 12 alone for more than 20-30 minutes. Fortunately, there are still some societies where the over-protective parent is not promoted as role model. Children in Norway and Finland 'enjoy being at home without their parents from about seven onwards' records Priscilla Alderson, a Reader in Childhood Studies at the Institute of Education in London. According to Alderson, Finnish children start school at 7 years, and sometimes go home at 11 a.m. where they play with friends until their parents arrive home in the late afternoon. In Anglo-American societies, where a paranoid parenting style prevails, such practices would be condemned as child abuse.</p> <p> The view that children cannot survive without the constant presence of a responsible adult is continually reinforced by public campaigns designed to frighten parents. 'Only use baby-sitters who are over 16 and responsible enough to look after your children' warned the NSPCC during its August Safe Open Spaces campaign. Even the time-honoured practice of using 14- or 15-year-olds eager to earn some pocket money through helping parents and dads look after their children is now dismissed as an act of gross irresponsibility.</p> <p> Today's parenting style sees safety and caution as intrinsic virtues.Paranoid parenting involves more than exaggerating the dangers facing children. It is driven by the constant expectation that something really bad is likely to happen to your youngster.</p> <p> Jacqueline Lang, Headmistress of Walthamstow Hall School in Sevenoaks, Kent, has characterized today's parenting style as 'the worst-case scenario approach'. Lang caught the public imagination in 1997 when she remarked to the local media that 'some girls in her school did not own a raincoat because they were ferried everywhere by car'. She identified one of the fundamental principles of paranoid parenting: the fear of taking risks. Her students' parents were simply too scared to allow their girls to walk to school. Children who are strangers to the outdoors do not need raincoats.</p> <p> Apprehension about child safety, and a morbid expectation that something terrible can happen any moment, mean that many risks that are well worth taking because of their stimulating effect on a child's development are simply avoided. Child-rearing today is not so much about managing the risks of everyday life, but avoiding them altogether. As child psychologist Jennie Linden argues, the adult 'preoccupation with risk can create too much emphasis on removing every conceivable source of even minor risk'. The characteristic feature of such an obsession is, according to Linden, 'to speculate excessively on what can go wrong rather than on what children may learn.' It is this precautionary approach which defines the parenting culture of contemporary society.</p> <p> Parents have always been concerned about protecting their children form harm. Asking 'What can go wrong?' is a sensible way of dealing with the many new experiences children encounter. To weigh up probabilities before doing something is an informed way of managing risk. But asking what can go wrong is very different from acting on the assumption that things will go wrong. Such a fatalistic outlook reduces the power of parents to make informed, intelligent judgements. A more appropriate approach might be to follow an assessment of what can go wrong with two other questions - 'Does it matter?' and 'What might the child learn from the experience?' The precautionary approach continually encourages adults to adopt the same one-dimensional response: Beware!</p> <p> It is tempting to interpret the precautionary approach to child- rearing as the irrational reaction of individual mothers and fathers. Child professionals sometimes point the finger at over-anxious parents and advise them to be more sensible about managing the risks their children face. Jacqueline Lang, who is exceptionally sensitive to the consequences of trying to 'inoculate' children against the risks thrown up by life, blames 'a generation of timid parents' for 'stifling the sense of adventure' of Britain's children. However, it is a mistake to reduce the problem to the personalities of some parents. How individual adults relate to their infants at any time is inseparable from the parenting style encouraged by our culture and society.</p> <p> Parents today face strong social pressures to adopt a precautionary approach towards child-rearing. Intimidating public campaigns endlessly remind them about the many risks their children face. It is difficult to retain a sense of perspective when the safety of children has become a permanent item of news.</p> <p><strong>The erosion of adult solidarity</strong></p> <p> Christina Hardyment, in her excellent study on baby-care advice past and present, is struck by the intensity of parental paranoia today. She senses a climate of permanent panic that invites a guilt-ridden style of parenting. The loss of small children's freedom is one consequence.' Children's freedom has never been restricted as it is today. A study by Dr Mayer Hillman of the Policy Studies Institute indicates that while 80 per cent of 7- and 8-year-olds went to school by themselves in 1970, fewer than 10 per cent are now allowed to do so. In the past, not even the archetypal over-anxious parent would have taken the precautionary approach that is now seen as the norm. Even though children have never been safer or healthier, at no time has so much concern and energy been devoted to protecting youngsters from harm.</p> <p> A Glasgow researcher, Stuart Waiton, has produced compelling evidence that counters the fear that children are at greater risk than in previous times. According to Waiton, between 1988 and 1999 the number of children murdered between the ages of and 16 decreased in England and Wales from 4 per million to 3 per million. The total murdered under the age of 5 dropped from 12 per million to 9 per million. Cases of abduction in which the offender was found guilty dropped from 26 to 8 over the same period.</p> <p> Although surveys confirm that paranoid parenting is widespread, there has been little attempt to understand its causes. The most common explanation is that it is all the fault of the sensationalist media. Panics about children's safety are interpreted as 'media-led' and television is accused of making parents unnecessarily apprehensive. 'Increasingly, we are bombarded by the news media with spectacular accounts of violence, illness and health concerns, as well as varied opinions about appropriate diets and child rearing practices', concluded the authors of one study of parental worries in the United States. They certainly have a point. Research into the British media's reporting of the horrific murder of 2-year-old Jamie Bulger by two 10-year-old boys shows that it had a major impact on parents. In a survey of 1,000 parents taken a year later, 97 percent cited the possible abduction of their children as their greatest fear. The Times reported that many of these parents revealed that 'video images of the two-year-old being taken by his killers were still fresh in their minds'.</p> <p> So yes, the media helps shape adults' perception of the risks faced by children. But it is far too simplistic to blame the media for the problems of parenting. Parents do not need high-profile media horror stories to provoke their insecurities. They worry about all manner of everyday things, all of the time. They can be anxious about Mary's weight on Monday, Tim's refusal to eat vegetables on Tuesday, the poor state of Mary's and Tim's education on Wednesday, and so on. A heightened sense of insecurity can attach itself to relatively mundane experiences such as whether a child is too fat or too thin. The media does not cause paranoid parenting. Its main role is to amplify society's concerns, to give shape to our fears. Confusing the messenger with the bad news is an understandable reaction, but not one that will help illuminate the issues at stake.</p> <p> So what is the bad news? In the chapters that follow, it should become clear that a variety of influences help to shape contemporary anxieties about parenting. But if one thing above all others has created the conditions for today's parenting crisis, it is the breakdown of adult solidarity.</p> <p> Adult solidarity is one of those used to take for granted. Most of the time, in most places, adult solidarity is practised by people who have never heard of the term. In most communities throughout the world adults assume a modicum of public responsibility for the welfare of children even if they have no ties to them. When the local newsagent or butcher scolds a child for dropping a chewing-gum wrapper on the road, they are actively assisting that boy's parents in the process of socialization. When a pensioner reprimands a young girl for crossing the road when the light is red, he is backing up her parents' attempt to teach, her the ways of the world. These displays of public responsibility teach children that certain behaviour is expected by the entire community, and not just by their mum and dad.</p> <p> It has long been recognized that the socialization of children relies on a wide network of responsible adults. Parents cannot be expected to act as 24-hour-a-day chaperones. Across cultures and throughout history, mothers and fathers have acted on the assumption that if their children got into trouble, other adults - often strangers - would help out. In many societies adults feel duty-bound to reprimand other people's children who misbehave in public.</p> <p> As every parent knows, in Britain today, fathers and mothers cannot rely on other adults to take responsibility for looking after their children. British adults are hesitant to engage with other people's youngsters. This reluctance to assume responsibility for the welfare of the young is not simply a matter of selfishness or indifference. Many adults fear that their action would be misunderstood and resented, perhaps even misinterpreted as abuse. Adults feel uncomfortable in the presence of children. They don't want to get involved and, even when confronted by a child in distress, are uncertain about how to behave.</p> <p> Take the following scene in a primary school in Bristol during the spring of 2000. The teachers have organized a group of 7-year-olds to go outside the schoolyard to count the cars that pass by. Little Henry is bored and proceeds to poke his head through the railings that separate the schoolyard from the street. He gets his head stuck. The teachers are at a loss to know what to do. A crowd gathers around the trapped child. One teacher finds a jar of cream and applies some of it on the railing to help Henry wriggle out of his predicament. It doesn't work. Parents begin to arrive to pick up the children. The teachers are standing around. Not one of them has attempted to pull Henry out. Not one of them has put an arm around the distressed boy in an act of reassurance. They are afraid of touching the child. Finally, Henry's mum arrives. She takes one look at her son, grabs hold of him, gives him a yank and he is out. Henry's 80-minute ordeal is over.</p> <p> The story was recounted to me in horror by a young teacher, as a statement about the world we live in. When I asked why she hadn't done something to help little Henry, she said that she had already been reprimanded a year earlier for being 'too physical' with one of her pupils.</p> <p> When we live in a society that warns off teachers, traditionally seen as being in loco parentis, it is hardly surprising that strangers hesitate before becoming involved with other people's children. If a teacher is not allowed to cuddle a crying child for fear of the action being misinterpreted, no wonder that passers-by will turn their backs on a weeping infant.</p> <p> Awkward adults uncomfortable in the company of children represent a serious problem for parents. Mothers and fathers feel that they are on their own. Worse, many parents are convinced that it is best if other adults don't interfere in their children's affairs. Parents regard other people not as allies, but as potentially predatory on their young ones. Clumsy adults inept at relating to children and anxious parents concerned about 'stranger-danger' are two sides of the same coin.</p> <p> This breakdown in adult solidarity breeds parental paranoia. The fear of the 'other person' is the most tangible expression of parental insecurity. A 1998 survey carried out by Families for Freedom noted that 89.5 per cent of the respondents had a general sense of foreboding about the safety of their children. This general sense of alarm became more focused when other adults were brought into the equation. It was said by 76 per cent that they were 'very worried' about their children's safety in relation to 'other people'. The other person is the stranger. Research carried out by Mary Joshi and Morag Maclean in 1995 found that more parents gave 'stranger-danger' as a reason for using cars for school journeys than any other reason.</p> <p> Perhaps that is why parents in Britain are more likely to drive their children to school than in Germany, Scandinavia and other parts of Europe where the distance between home and school may be far greater. In societies where neighbours and other adults assume a degree of responsibility for keeping an eye on children, attitudes towards their safety are far less obsessive. A comparative study of children's independent mobility concluded that there is far less parental supervision in Germany than the UK. According to the authors, one reason why German parents are more likely to allow children out on their own is because they expect other adults to keep an eye on them; in turn, German children reported feeling that they were watched over by the adult world. This culture of collaboration creates a sense of security for German parents. The expectation that other adults will do the right thing helps them to take a more relaxed attitude towards letting their children out of the door than might be the case in Britain. One consequence of the erosion of adult solidarity in Britain is that the distance that children are allowed to stray from home has been reduced to one-ninth of what it was in 1970.</p> <p><strong>A poisonous atmosphere for parenting</strong></p> <p> The finger points not only at other adults; British parents themselves have also come under suspicion. The public is frequently warned that children are at risk from their own parents. Parents who find it difficult to deal with the pressures of everyday life have been portrayed as potential abusers. In May 2000, the NSPCC launched its Full Stop campaign. Shocking pictures on billboards show a loving mother playing with her baby. The caption reads: 'Later she wanted to hold a pillow over his face.' Another picture highlights a loving father cuddling his baby. The words 'that night he felt like slamming her against the cot' serve as a chilling reminder not to be deceived by appearances. The NSPCC justified its scaremongering tactics on the grounds that it was telling parents that it is normal to snap under pressure, and that they need to learn to handle the strain. But this alleged link between parental incompetence and abusive behaviour has disturbing implications for every father and mother. If anyone can snap and smash the head of their baby against the wall, whom can you trust?</p> <p> It is easy for a mother or a father to lose control and lash out at their youngster. Regrettably most of us have done it on more than one occasion. Snapping under pressure is a normal is unfortunate fact of life. But when we snap we don't go on to smash our baby's head against the wall. It may be normal for parents to snap, but it is wrong for the NSPCC to suggest that this temporary loss of control 'normally' leads to abuse. The implication that parenting under pressure is an invitation to abuse is an insult to the integrity of millions of hardworking mothers and fathers. It also helps to create a poisonous atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust.</p> <p> A booklet Protecting our Children: A Guide for Parents, sponsored by Labour MP Dan Norris and with a foreword by Prime Minister Tony Blair, explains that anybody might be a paedophile. 'They live in our communities, in our families and may even be someone we know and love', the booklet informs the reader. 'How can seemingly kind and even respectable people abuse children' it asks?' Anyone reading this book is invited to look at people 'we know and love' with a newly suspicious eye. If it is indeed the case that anyone and everyone in our communities and our families should be treated with caution, then trust and collaboration between adults become impossible.</p> <p> Family life, once idealized as a haven from a heartless world, is now widely depicted as a site of domestic violence and abuse. Child protection professionals and press commentators are always warning of the dangers that children face from their 'normal' parents. If victimization within the family is pandemic then clearly we are obliged to mistrust even those closest to us. The focus of anxiety can no longer be the alien stranger or criminal, but our closest family relations, neighbours, friends, lovers and workmates. Such a suspicious attitude towards everyday life redefines how people are expected to relate to those closest to them. This culture of fear places parents in a difficult position. Every year some 120,000 parents experience the nightmare of being wrongly accused of child abuse.' Since normal parents are now portrayed as potential abusers, it is not surprising that so many face investigation on the basis of hearsay and rumour.</p> <p> Scare campaigns that target parents represent a body blow to the authority of every mother and father. Here and there, public figures still pay lip service to the 'great job' performed by parents. But the ceaseless reminders of parental failure take their toll. Campaigns which claim that it is normal for parents to snap and abuse permeate the public imagination, and incite us to be suspicious of our neighbours. When even nice mothers and fathers are potential monsters it is difficult to regard parents in a positive light. Everyone now feels entitled to speculate about what Mary's dad is up to. Under this pressure, parents will openly criticize other mothers and fathers - sometimes in front of the children. A society that expects parents to teach children to avoid strangers and to regard them with dread is storing up big problems for the future. When parents instruct children about stranger-danger these days, they are also communicating a negative statement about the adult world - and, by implication, about themselves.</p> <p><a href=\"http://books.theguardian.com/firstchapters/story/0,6761,478365,00.html\">Continue</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The precautionary approach to parenting Parental paranoia today is more than simply a worse version of past anxieties. For instance, a common target of child-rearing manuals before the Second World War was the over-protective parent, and guilt-ridden parents worried that they might be 'smothering' their children. But how many times do we hear parents criticized for being over-protective today? Indeed, many of the traits associated with the classic over-protective father or mother are likely to be praised by today's child experts as responsible parenting. Parents are continually urged to do even more to protect their children. Researchers advise parents to supervise children, not only outdoors, but even when they watch television. The term 'coviewing' has been coined to describe the practice of hands-on parents playing the role of a 'media value filter and a media educator'. Other researchers further, claim that parental supervision inoculates children from many of the dangers they face. They contend that 'parental monitoring has been inversely associated with antisocial behaviour, drug use, tobacco use and early sexual activity'. There is obviously some truth in this. The more time a child spends in the company of his or her parents the less time is available for smoking, drinking and sex. But to equate the amount of parental supervision directly with behavioural outcomes tells parents that the more time they manage to spend with their children, the better their offspring will be. This raises the question of where to draw the line. How do parents decide how much monitoring is reasonably required, as opposed to optimally possible? Unfortunately, parental supervision is today always interpreted as a positive virtue so parents can never spend too much time supervising their youngsters. Child-rearing experts occasionally concede that it is simply impossible to keep children and young teenagers under constant adult supervision. But even then they insist that alternative, indirect, forms of child surveillance are employed. One American expert argues that if a child has to be left under self-care, then parents must do whatever they can to supervise in absentia, by liaising with a trusted adult who knows what the youngster is up to. The message is clear: if you are going to shirk your responsibility towards your child even for a few hours, you must at least make sure that somebody else is doing your job for you. Parents are not just advised to supervise their children. In Britain, such advice contains the implicit threat of legal sanction. Although in England and Wales there is no statutory age at which it is illegal to leave your children unattended, a parent who is deemed to neglect, abandon or expose her children to danger can be liable to prosecution. According to Carolyn Hamilton of the Children's Legal Centre, the general view taken by child protection professionals is that a parent should not leave children under 12 alone for more than 20-30 minutes. What a shock this would have been to the parents of 'latch-key' youngsters in the 1970s. At that time debate about the children of working mothers returning from school to empty homes focused on whether it was right for women to have jobs which deprived their children of a welcoming smile and the smell of home baking. The issue was not seen as one of child safety and certainly not abandonment. Yet today's legal experts advise that, while parents are unlikely to face prosecution for a 30-minute absence, the parent of an 11-year-old left alone for three to four hours might face legal action. Even though very few parents are prosecuted in these circumstances, the strict guidelines convey a clear message about what society expects of parents. And that expectation is founded on the premise that parents can never do too much to protect their children. Twenty or thirty years ago, authors of child-rearing manuals had their own way of making parents feel guilty. But they would have reacted with disbelief to the proposition that it was wrong to leave children under 12 alone for more than 20-30 minutes. Fortunately, there are still some societies where the over-protective parent is not promoted as role model. Children in Norway and Finland 'enjoy being at home without their parents from about seven onwards' records Priscilla Alderson, a Reader in Childhood Studies at the Institute of Education in London. According to Alderson, Finnish children start school at 7 years, and sometimes go home at 11 a.m. where they play with friends until their parents arrive home in the late afternoon. In Anglo-American societies, where a paranoid parenting style prevails, such practices would be condemned as child abuse. The view that children cannot survive without the constant presence of a responsible adult is continually reinforced by public campaigns designed to frighten parents. 'Only use baby-sitters who are over 16 and responsible enough to look after your children' warned the NSPCC during its August Safe Open Spaces campaign. Even the time-honoured practice of using 14- or 15-year-olds eager to earn some pocket money through helping parents and dads look after their children is now dismissed as an act of gross irresponsibility. Today's parenting style sees safety and caution as intrinsic virtues.Paranoid parenting involves more than exaggerating the dangers facing children. It is driven by the constant expectation that something really bad is likely to happen to your youngster. Jacqueline Lang, Headmistress of Walthamstow Hall School in Sevenoaks, Kent, has characterized today's parenting style as 'the worst-case scenario approach'. Lang caught the public imagination in 1997 when she remarked to the local media that 'some girls in her school did not own a raincoat because they were ferried everywhere by car'. She identified one of the fundamental principles of paranoid parenting: the fear of taking risks. Her students' parents were simply too scared to allow their girls to walk to school. Children who are strangers to the outdoors do not need raincoats. Apprehension about child safety, and a morbid expectation that something terrible can happen any moment, mean that many risks that are well worth taking because of their stimulating effect on a child's development are simply avoided. Child-rearing today is not so much about managing the risks of everyday life, but avoiding them altogether. As child psychologist Jennie Linden argues, the adult 'preoccupation with risk can create too much emphasis on removing every conceivable source of even minor risk'. The characteristic feature of such an obsession is, according to Linden, 'to speculate excessively on what can go wrong rather than on what children may learn.' It is this precautionary approach which defines the parenting culture of contemporary society. Parents have always been concerned about protecting their children form harm. Asking 'What can go wrong?' is a sensible way of dealing with the many new experiences children encounter. To weigh up probabilities before doing something is an informed way of managing risk. But asking what can go wrong is very different from acting on the assumption that things will go wrong. Such a fatalistic outlook reduces the power of parents to make informed, intelligent judgements. A more appropriate approach might be to follow an assessment of what can go wrong with two other questions - 'Does it matter?' and 'What might the child learn from the experience?' The precautionary approach continually encourages adults to adopt the same one-dimensional response: Beware! It is tempting to interpret the precautionary approach to child- rearing as the irrational reaction of individual mothers and fathers. Child professionals sometimes point the finger at over-anxious parents and advise them to be more sensible about managing the risks their children face. Jacqueline Lang, who is exceptionally sensitive to the consequences of trying to 'inoculate' children against the risks thrown up by life, blames 'a generation of timid parents' for 'stifling the sense of adventure' of Britain's children. However, it is a mistake to reduce the problem to the personalities of some parents. How individual adults relate to their infants at any time is inseparable from the parenting style encouraged by our culture and society. Parents today face strong social pressures to adopt a precautionary approach towards child-rearing. Intimidating public campaigns endlessly remind them about the many risks their children face. It is difficult to retain a sense of perspective when the safety of children has become a permanent item of news. The erosion of adult solidarity Christina Hardyment, in her excellent study on baby-care advice past and present, is struck by the intensity of parental paranoia today. She senses a climate of permanent panic that invites a guilt-ridden style of parenting. The loss of small children's freedom is one consequence.' Children's freedom has never been restricted as it is today. A study by Dr Mayer Hillman of the Policy Studies Institute indicates that while 80 per cent of 7- and 8-year-olds went to school by themselves in 1970, fewer than 10 per cent are now allowed to do so. In the past, not even the archetypal over-anxious parent would have taken the precautionary approach that is now seen as the norm. Even though children have never been safer or healthier, at no time has so much concern and energy been devoted to protecting youngsters from harm. A Glasgow researcher, Stuart Waiton, has produced compelling evidence that counters the fear that children are at greater risk than in previous times. According to Waiton, between 1988 and 1999 the number of children murdered between the ages of and 16 decreased in England and Wales from 4 per million to 3 per million. The total murdered under the age of 5 dropped from 12 per million to 9 per million. Cases of abduction in which the offender was found guilty dropped from 26 to 8 over the same period. Although surveys confirm that paranoid parenting is widespread, there has been little attempt to understand its causes. The most common explanation is that it is all the fault of the sensationalist media. Panics about children's safety are interpreted as 'media-led' and television is accused of making parents unnecessarily apprehensive. 'Increasingly, we are bombarded by the news media with spectacular accounts of violence, illness and health concerns, as well as varied opinions about appropriate diets and child rearing practices', concluded the authors of one study of parental worries in the United States. They certainly have a point. Research into the British media's reporting of the horrific murder of 2-year-old Jamie Bulger by two 10-year-old boys shows that it had a major impact on parents. In a survey of 1,000 parents taken a year later, 97 percent cited the possible abduction of their children as their greatest fear. The Times reported that many of these parents revealed that 'video images of the two-year-old being taken by his killers were still fresh in their minds'. So yes, the media helps shape adults' perception of the risks faced by children. But it is far too simplistic to blame the media for the problems of parenting. Parents do not need high-profile media horror stories to provoke their insecurities. They worry about all manner of everyday things, all of the time. They can be anxious about Mary's weight on Monday, Tim's refusal to eat vegetables on Tuesday, the poor state of Mary's and Tim's education on Wednesday, and so on. A heightened sense of insecurity can attach itself to relatively mundane experiences such as whether a child is too fat or too thin. The media does not cause paranoid parenting. Its main role is to amplify society's concerns, to give shape to our fears. Confusing the messenger with the bad news is an understandable reaction, but not one that will help illuminate the issues at stake. So what is the bad news? In the chapters that follow, it should become clear that a variety of influences help to shape contemporary anxieties about parenting. But if one thing above all others has created the conditions for today's parenting crisis, it is the breakdown of adult solidarity. Adult solidarity is one of those used to take for granted. Most of the time, in most places, adult solidarity is practised by people who have never heard of the term. In most communities throughout the world adults assume a modicum of public responsibility for the welfare of children even if they have no ties to them. When the local newsagent or butcher scolds a child for dropping a chewing-gum wrapper on the road, they are actively assisting that boy's parents in the process of socialization. When a pensioner reprimands a young girl for crossing the road when the light is red, he is backing up her parents' attempt to teach, her the ways of the world. These displays of public responsibility teach children that certain behaviour is expected by the entire community, and not just by their mum and dad. It has long been recognized that the socialization of children relies on a wide network of responsible adults. Parents cannot be expected to act as 24-hour-a-day chaperones. Across cultures and throughout history, mothers and fathers have acted on the assumption that if their children got into trouble, other adults - often strangers - would help out. In many societies adults feel duty-bound to reprimand other people's children who misbehave in public. As every parent knows, in Britain today, fathers and mothers cannot rely on other adults to take responsibility for looking after their children. British adults are hesitant to engage with other people's youngsters. This reluctance to assume responsibility for the welfare of the young is not simply a matter of selfishness or indifference. Many adults fear that their action would be misunderstood and resented, perhaps even misinterpreted as abuse. Adults feel uncomfortable in the presence of children. They don't want to get involved and, even when confronted by a child in distress, are uncertain about how to behave. Take the following scene in a primary school in Bristol during the spring of 2000. The teachers have organized a group of 7-year-olds to go outside the schoolyard to count the cars that pass by. Little Henry is bored and proceeds to poke his head through the railings that separate the schoolyard from the street. He gets his head stuck. The teachers are at a loss to know what to do. A crowd gathers around the trapped child. One teacher finds a jar of cream and applies some of it on the railing to help Henry wriggle out of his predicament. It doesn't work. Parents begin to arrive to pick up the children. The teachers are standing around. Not one of them has attempted to pull Henry out. Not one of them has put an arm around the distressed boy in an act of reassurance. They are afraid of touching the child. Finally, Henry's mum arrives. She takes one look at her son, grabs hold of him, gives him a yank and he is out. Henry's 80-minute ordeal is over. The story was recounted to me in horror by a young teacher, as a statement about the world we live in. When I asked why she hadn't done something to help little Henry, she said that she had already been reprimanded a year earlier for being 'too physical' with one of her pupils. When we live in a society that warns off teachers, traditionally seen as being in loco parentis, it is hardly surprising that strangers hesitate before becoming involved with other people's children. If a teacher is not allowed to cuddle a crying child for fear of the action being misinterpreted, no wonder that passers-by will turn their backs on a weeping infant. Awkward adults uncomfortable in the company of children represent a serious problem for parents. Mothers and fathers feel that they are on their own. Worse, many parents are convinced that it is best if other adults don't interfere in their children's affairs. Parents regard other people not as allies, but as potentially predatory on their young ones. Clumsy adults inept at relating to children and anxious parents concerned about 'stranger-danger' are two sides of the same coin. This breakdown in adult solidarity breeds parental paranoia. The fear of the 'other person' is the most tangible expression of parental insecurity. A 1998 survey carried out by Families for Freedom noted that 89.5 per cent of the respondents had a general sense of foreboding about the safety of their children. This general sense of alarm became more focused when other adults were brought into the equation. It was said by 76 per cent that they were 'very worried' about their children's safety in relation to 'other people'. The other person is the stranger. Research carried out by Mary Joshi and Morag Maclean in 1995 found that more parents gave 'stranger-danger' as a reason for using cars for school journeys than any other reason. Perhaps that is why parents in Britain are more likely to drive their children to school than in Germany, Scandinavia and other parts of Europe where the distance between home and school may be far greater. In societies where neighbours and other adults assume a degree of responsibility for keeping an eye on children, attitudes towards their safety are far less obsessive. A comparative study of children's independent mobility concluded that there is far less parental supervision in Germany than the UK. According to the authors, one reason why German parents are more likely to allow children out on their own is because they expect other adults to keep an eye on them; in turn, German children reported feeling that they were watched over by the adult world. This culture of collaboration creates a sense of security for German parents. The expectation that other adults will do the right thing helps them to take a more relaxed attitude towards letting their children out of the door than might be the case in Britain. One consequence of the erosion of adult solidarity in Britain is that the distance that children are allowed to stray from home has been reduced to one-ninth of what it was in 1970. A poisonous atmosphere for parenting The finger points not only at other adults; British parents themselves have also come under suspicion. The public is frequently warned that children are at risk from their own parents. Parents who find it difficult to deal with the pressures of everyday life have been portrayed as potential abusers. In May 2000, the NSPCC launched its Full Stop campaign. Shocking pictures on billboards show a loving mother playing with her baby. The caption reads: 'Later she wanted to hold a pillow over his face.' Another picture highlights a loving father cuddling his baby. The words 'that night he felt like slamming her against the cot' serve as a chilling reminder not to be deceived by appearances. The NSPCC justified its scaremongering tactics on the grounds that it was telling parents that it is normal to snap under pressure, and that they need to learn to handle the strain. But this alleged link between parental incompetence and abusive behaviour has disturbing implications for every father and mother. If anyone can snap and smash the head of their baby against the wall, whom can you trust? It is easy for a mother or a father to lose control and lash out at their youngster. Regrettably most of us have done it on more than one occasion. Snapping under pressure is a normal is unfortunate fact of life. But when we snap we don't go on to smash our baby's head against the wall. It may be normal for parents to snap, but it is wrong for the NSPCC to suggest that this temporary loss of control 'normally' leads to abuse. The implication that parenting under pressure is an invitation to abuse is an insult to the integrity of millions of hardworking mothers and fathers. It also helps to create a poisonous atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust. A booklet Protecting our Children: A Guide for Parents, sponsored by Labour MP Dan Norris and with a foreword by Prime Minister Tony Blair, explains that anybody might be a paedophile. 'They live in our communities, in our families and may even be someone we know and love', the booklet informs the reader. 'How can seemingly kind and even respectable people abuse children' it asks?' Anyone reading this book is invited to look at people 'we know and love' with a newly suspicious eye. If it is indeed the case that anyone and everyone in our communities and our families should be treated with caution, then trust and collaboration between adults become impossible. Family life, once idealized as a haven from a heartless world, is now widely depicted as a site of domestic violence and abuse. Child protection professionals and press commentators are always warning of the dangers that children face from their 'normal' parents. If victimization within the family is pandemic then clearly we are obliged to mistrust even those closest to us. The focus of anxiety can no longer be the alien stranger or criminal, but our closest family relations, neighbours, friends, lovers and workmates. Such a suspicious attitude towards everyday life redefines how people are expected to relate to those closest to them. This culture of fear places parents in a difficult position. Every year some 120,000 parents experience the nightmare of being wrongly accused of child abuse.' Since normal parents are now portrayed as potential abusers, it is not surprising that so many face investigation on the basis of hearsay and rumour. Scare campaigns that target parents represent a body blow to the authority of every mother and father. Here and there, public figures still pay lip service to the 'great job' performed by parents. But the ceaseless reminders of parental failure take their toll. Campaigns which claim that it is normal for parents to snap and abuse permeate the public imagination, and incite us to be suspicious of our neighbours. When even nice mothers and fathers are potential monsters it is difficult to regard parents in a positive light. Everyone now feels entitled to speculate about what Mary's dad is up to. Under this pressure, parents will openly criticize other mothers and fathers - sometimes in front of the children. A society that expects parents to teach children to avoid strangers and to regard them with dread is storing up big problems for the future. When parents instruct children about stranger-danger these days, they are also communicating a negative statement about the adult world - and, by implication, about themselves. Continue",

      "body": "<p><strong>The code of mistrust</strong></p> <p> If family life is seen as essentially rotten to the core, which other institution could possibly be perceived as good? If parents, brothers and sisters cannot be entirely trusted, how can we have faith in the integrity of more distant acquaintances? This is the message conveyed on a daily basis through television and popular culture. Not a day goes by without another sordid tale of some professional abusing the trust that has been placed in him or her. The suspicion of abuse that hangs over the family has spread like a disease to infect other institutions from schools to Scout and Guide groups. Where once there would have been an assumption of goodwill, dangers are now seen to lurk.</p> <p> An editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine claims that sport is 'the last refuge of child abuse'. 'I know it is going on from hundreds of interviews with athletes but it is difficult to get any statistical evidence', writes Celia Brackenridge. Many sporting bodies have issued guidelines about how to spot potential abusers working in their midst. In December 1998 the Amateur Swimming Association, in conjunction with the NSPCC, set up a helpline for children on the grounds that their sport might be targeted by paedophiles like the Olympic swimming coach jailed for child sex abuse. In 1999, the England and Wales Cricket Board issued child protection guidelines. At least one commentator blamed the collapse of English cricket on paedophiles who made parents reluctant to allow unsupervised children to play the game.</p> <p> Predatory paedophiles have also become an issue with the St John Ambulance service, after three of its officers were jailed for the long-term abuse of cadets in 1998. The British Scout Association has been implicated in sex scandals. After a Coventry Scoutmaster was jailed for indecency offences against two boys and a Hampshire Scoutmaster was sentenced to six years for sexually abusing eight boys, the Association adopted a policy to 'safeguard the welfare of all members by protecting them from physical, sexual and emotional harm.</p> <p> Even religious organizations have been implicated in this, climate of fear. In Australia, Roman Catholic bishops have sought to ban their priests from having any private contact with children. Guidelines drawn up with the approval of the Vatican mean that confessionals have to be fitted with glass viewing panels. Priests are also banned from seeing any child alone with the door closed. Closed doors and private interaction are no longer acceptable to a society fed on a constant diet of mistrust. It is as if by definition the closed door is an invitation to abuse.</p> <p> Any one-to-one contact between adults and children has effectively been stigmatized. A guideline published by the Salvation Army advises its members to ensure that 'an adult is not left alone with a child or a young person where there is little or no opportunity for the activity to be observed by others'. It adds that this 'may mean groups working within the same large room or working in an adjoining room with the door left open'. Salvation Army members were far from happy with this rule since many of their activities involve musical practice. Since band members play different instruments at various levels of proficiency, a lot of the training took place one-to-one in separate rooms.

In one case a rector at a village church was forced to disband a choir because of new guidelines on child protection. Up to 20 child choristers met weekly for rehearsals and sang every Sunday at St Michael's Church in Northchapel, West Sussex. The Rev. Gerald Kirkham had to stop recruiting because, under the new code, at least two adult chaperones were needed at choir practice.</p> <p> Mistrust of adults, especially of men, has had a destructive impact on working relations between adults and children. Many adults have become wary of volunteering for this sort of work. The British Scout Association faces a shortage of volunteer leaders. 'If a man says he wants to work with young boys, people jump to one conclusion', reported Jo Tupper, a spokeswoman for the Scout Association. A similar pattern is evident in primary education. Research carried out by Mary Thornton of Hertfordshire University suggests that men are turning away from primary school teaching because of fears that they will be labelled 'perverts'. Thornton claimed that men on teacher training programmes 'felt they had no idea how to deal with physical contact'. Some of the trainees asked, for example, whether they 'should cuddle a distressed child'. When physical contact with children comes with a health warning, teachers face a continual dilemma over how to handle routine issues in the classroom. In August 1998, the Local Government Association even went so far as to advise teachers not to put sun cream on pupils because it could lead to accusations of child abuse. Lord Puttnam, the inaugural chairman of the General Teaching Council has warned that when teachers are regarded as potential rapists and paedophiles their authority is seriously undermined.</p> <p> In November 1999, it was reported that 'Teachers, fearful of accusations of any kind of inappropriate touching, are increasingly wary of direct contact with the children in their charge, even if tears are involved.' One school in Glasgow has responded to this 'affectionphobic culture' by introducing special massage classes for children. The idea is that pupils will stay fully clothed and standing upright while they take turns to massage each other's heads, backs and shoulders. While the teacher reads a story, they will also take turns to massage each other's forearms with plain, unscented oil.' A new ritual for an age that dreads physical contact between adult and child.</p> <p> Fear of adults victimizing children is fuelled by a child protection industry obsessed with the issue of abuse. The NSPCC's Safe Open Spaces for Children, launched in August 1999, advised parents never to make their children 'kiss or hug an adult if they don't want to'. The justification for this proposal was that it would make children confident about refusing the advances of a stranger. From time immemorial, parents have pleaded with their children to kiss or hug grandmothers and aunts. The call to ban this innocent practice is symptomatic of the intense professional mistrust of adult behaviour towards children.</p> <p> All this hysteria about physical contact actually does little to protect children. By casting the net so wide and expecting child abuse to be a normal occurrence, there is a danger of trivializing this dreadful deed. A climate of suspicion will not deter the child abuser, but it will undermine the confidence of all parents. And at the end of the day, confident parents are best placed to educate their children to deal with risks and danger.</p> <p><strong>The flight from children</strong></p> <p> From voluntary organizations to primary education, well-meaning adults are being put off from playing a valuable role in instructing and inspiring young children. At a conference organized by Playlink and Portsmouth City Council in November 1999, the delegates were enthusiastic professionals committed to improving children's lives through outdoor play. But several of the play workers felt that their role was diminished by bureaucratic rules designed to regulate their contact with children. One play worker complained that she often could not do 'what's right' by the children, because if she did not follow the rules it would threaten her career prospects.</p> <p> Those who work with children are automatically undermined by new conventions that control their behaviour. If it is assumed that professional carers need to be told how to relate to the children in their charge, why should parents - or children - trust them? But it is not only professional carers or volunteers who are affected by this climate of paranoia. Suspicion towards them reflects and reinforces a more general distrust of adults. It is assumed that none of us can be expected to respect the line between childhood and adulthood: that we need to be told what almost all of us know by instinct - children are vulnerable creatures who need protection. This means comforting a distraught child with a cuddle just as much as it means not abusing those young people who have put their trust in you.</p> <p> The negative image of adulthood enshrined in the new conventions has far-reaching implications. The healthy development of any community depends on the quality of the bond that links different generations. When those bonds are subjected to such intense suspicion, the ensuing confusion can threaten the very future of a community. After all, relations of warmth and affection are inherent in family relationships, and even in relations between children and other caters. If an adult touching a child comes to be regarded with anxiety, how can these relations be sustained?</p> <p> Is it any surprise that many adults are literally scared of badly behaved children. Take the following scene on the lawn of one of Britain's leading universities. Over 200 law lecturers and students are waiting for an official photograph to be taken. A young girl cycles up to the group and plonks herself down in front of the group and refuses to move. She is asked politely to move, but still refuses to do so. Not a single adult in this large group dares to intervene, reprimand the young girl or physically move her on. Afterwards, the lecturers justify their paralysis on the grounds that they feared accusations of assault or abuse if they had attempted to move her out of the way. In this stand-off the young girl emerges as the winner. Twenty minutes later, bored with her easy victory over the disoriented adults, the girl leaves of her own accord.</p> <p> It should really come as no surprise that some children have begun to play off this general distrust of adults to make life difficult for those they don't like. Most children are enterprising creatures, for whom adult insecurities provide an opportunity to exercise their power. Every year hundreds of teachers face false allegations of abuse. A teacher wept openly at the April 2000 conference of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers as he recounted his three months of agony after being falsely accused of punching a 12-year-old pupil. Other teachers recounted cases of false accusation and demanded that school staff should not be treated as guilty until proven innocent. It is tempting to blame malicious children for making life hell for some of their teachers. But it is not really their fault. They are merely manipulating a dirty-minded world created by obsessive adults.</p> <p> The distrust of adult motives has encouraged a flight from children: a distancing between the generations. In some cases it has led to an avoidance of physical contact, in others the reluctance to take responsibility. The flight from children expresses adult confusions about how to relate to younger generations. Elderly people in particular are often unclear about what is expected of them in dealing with children. An 82-year-old man with numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren provides a classic illustration of this dilemma:</p> <p> I was in a shop and this woman came in who the wife knew, with her little granddaughter. I was eating a sweet, and this little girl looked up at me, so I said, 'would you like a sweetie, duck?' She got all scared and jumped back. And I said, 'well that's the best thing you want to do. Never take a sweetie off nobody'. She done right, but it made me feel cheap, like. It made me feel awful really, to think I was offering a little girl a sweet. And I love kiddies. In the paper you hear there's horrible people about and it's awful, but it made me feel right cheap.</p> <p> This octogenarian has internalized the new mood of suspicion towards adult motives. His mental retreat from following his well-meaning instincts towards the young girl is part of a general pattern. Sadly, this flight from children means that adult collaboration in raising the young rests on a fragile foundation. Parents of course cannot flee from their children. They are left to deal with the damage caused by the erosion of adult solidarity. They are truly on their own. The decline of adult solidarity means that parents must pay the cost for society's estrangement from its children.</p> <p><strong>Parents on their own</strong></p> <p> More than ever parents are on their own. According to Professor John Adams of University College, London, we live in an age of hypermobility, where the car has facilitated a new level of social dispersal. Adams believes that hypermobiliry has led to the increased anonymity of individual households, a decline of conviviality towards our neighbours, a less child-friendly environment and the emergence of parental anxieties towards children's outdoor safety. His concerns are echoed by numerous studies that confirm a palpable sense of social isolation. A survey published by the Royal Mail in 1999 revealed that people now live further away from relatives - though the majority still live within an hour's journey. A quarter of respondents aged under 35 rarely or never spoke to their neighbours. Nearly a third of these respondents said that they would only offer to help neighbours if it was absolutely necessary, and did not want to know them any better. This indifference towards the fate of neighbours underlines the absence of communal affinity. We often live in neighbourhoods without neighbours. The absence of an obvious network of support has important implications for the way that adults negotiate the task of child-rearing.</p> <p> The theme of social isolation is a familiar one to most parents. Mothers and fathers complain about an uneasy sense that they are 'on their own'. Many mothers, especially those who work, are preoccupied with what could go wrong with their childcare arrangements. When there are no relatives near, and you are not on first-name terms with your neighbours, who is to pick up your child when your meeting runs late? Who can stay home and nurse a child off school for two weeks with chickenpox? The absence of an obvious back-up, the tenuous quality of friendship networks and the difficulty of gaining access to quality childcare all helps to create the feeling that life is one long struggle, increasing tensions within the household.</p> <p> The fragmentation of family relations and the diminished sense of community have inevitably helped to make parents feel insecure. Not knowing where to turn in case of trouble can produce an intense sense of vulnerability - especially among lone parents who feel that they are literally on their own. The isolation of parents is not simply physical. The erosion of adult solidarity transforms parenting into an intensely lonely affair. A climate of suspicion serves to distance mothers and fathers from the world of adults. In turn, this predicament invites parents to be anxious and over-react - not just to the danger they see posed by strangers, but to every problem to do with their youngsters' development. As we shall see, paranoid parenting now embraces almost every aspect of child-rearing. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The code of mistrust If family life is seen as essentially rotten to the core, which other institution could possibly be perceived as good? If parents, brothers and sisters cannot be entirely trusted, how can we have faith in the integrity of more distant acquaintances? This is the message conveyed on a daily basis through television and popular culture. Not a day goes by without another sordid tale of some professional abusing the trust that has been placed in him or her. The suspicion of abuse that hangs over the family has spread like a disease to infect other institutions from schools to Scout and Guide groups. Where once there would have been an assumption of goodwill, dangers are now seen to lurk. An editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine claims that sport is 'the last refuge of child abuse'. 'I know it is going on from hundreds of interviews with athletes but it is difficult to get any statistical evidence', writes Celia Brackenridge. Many sporting bodies have issued guidelines about how to spot potential abusers working in their midst. In December 1998 the Amateur Swimming Association, in conjunction with the NSPCC, set up a helpline for children on the grounds that their sport might be targeted by paedophiles like the Olympic swimming coach jailed for child sex abuse. In 1999, the England and Wales Cricket Board issued child protection guidelines. At least one commentator blamed the collapse of English cricket on paedophiles who made parents reluctant to allow unsupervised children to play the game. Predatory paedophiles have also become an issue with the St John Ambulance service, after three of its officers were jailed for the long-term abuse of cadets in 1998. The British Scout Association has been implicated in sex scandals. After a Coventry Scoutmaster was jailed for indecency offences against two boys and a Hampshire Scoutmaster was sentenced to six years for sexually abusing eight boys, the Association adopted a policy to 'safeguard the welfare of all members by protecting them from physical, sexual and emotional harm. Even religious organizations have been implicated in this, climate of fear. In Australia, Roman Catholic bishops have sought to ban their priests from having any private contact with children. Guidelines drawn up with the approval of the Vatican mean that confessionals have to be fitted with glass viewing panels. Priests are also banned from seeing any child alone with the door closed. Closed doors and private interaction are no longer acceptable to a society fed on a constant diet of mistrust. It is as if by definition the closed door is an invitation to abuse. Any one-to-one contact between adults and children has effectively been stigmatized. A guideline published by the Salvation Army advises its members to ensure that 'an adult is not left alone with a child or a young person where there is little or no opportunity for the activity to be observed by others'. It adds that this 'may mean groups working within the same large room or working in an adjoining room with the door left open'.

      "body": "<p>It is a prospect that terrifies all men. You start taking an unusual interest in A-Zs, wearing clothes that were fashionable 15 years ago and complaining that they don't play any proper songs on Radio 1 any more (\"just that dance stuff without any tunes\"). The merits of taking a Thermos flask to a football match seem suddenly irrefutable. Then, in a moment of exasperation, you shout something at the kids, only the voice that's speaking is not you any more - it's your dad. Be afraid, son, be very afraid. </p> <p>The underrated musical comedian Steve Gribbin has just recorded a very funny song entitled I'm Turning Into My Dad on his new CD In Bulk (Houllier Records). Gribbin reveals how, to his horror, he has started shouting at the TV, turning off electrical appliances at night (\"I asked my dad why he always turned off the video at night, as I always have to reset the clock every morning, and he just said, 'Fire! Great God of Fire come in night kill us all! Come creeping out of the socket like bad magic!' \") and saying things like \"Five ninety-nine for a pair of slip-on shoes? That's more than Gerry and the Pacemakers earn in a year!\" </p> <p>For the chorus Gribbin hollers, \"I like all the furniture in the living room to stay in the same place it's been for years and years/I've got a cavalcade of hair cascading out of my nose and ears/My bladder control's getting bad/I'm turning into my dad!\" </p> <p>It's happening to me, too. I knew as much when I discovered myself paying as much attention to the football news on Ceefax - even the news of new Torquay signings in the round-up on page 312 - as my dad does to the stocks and shares pages. During the Easter holiday, I actually found myself listening to my dad telling me that he had just discovered a button on the remote that froze a Ceefax page. Worse yet, I thought this information both interesting and useful. </p> <p>Since the arrival of my second daughter, I've even acquired my own \"dad's chair\" - with the best view of the telly - that no other family member can sit in. I hear my dad's voice when I advise my partner (only he would never use that word) Nicola to take a tough line with the insurance company over our subsidence claim, to open an Isa at once, and not to leave her computer on all day because they can be struck by lightning. </p> <p>It can only be a short step to developing the capacity - common to all dads - of spending the first 20 minutes after arrival at any destination discussing motorway routes. It is a weird and far from pleasant feeling, this cross-generational migration of souls. </p> <p>So why do men fear - yet perhaps furtively feel reassured by - turning into their dads? </p> <p>\"Psychologists used to think that human development was mostly over by early adulthood, but in the last decade, theories of lifespan developmental psychology have shown that the mid-life transition is a real one,\" says Dr Nigel King, reader in psychology at the University of Huddersfield. </p> <p>\"Men are taken by surprise more than women, as they tend to be more unrealistic about having eternal youth,\" continues King. \"Actually, there have probably been a number of steady incremental changes going on for several years, but men do become aware of them very suddenly. Often it's some other life event, such as turning 40 or the kids going to secondary school, that gives them the cue to think of them selves as middle-aged. They start to think in terms of time left, rather than assuming they have unlimited time - and then they start thinking they've suddenly changed into their dads.\" </p> <p>Indeed, what men really fear is turning into someone they said they would never ever resemble. I might be a Guardian-reading Old Labour hack living in Highbury, but my dad is a Telegraph-reading former farmer who regards Ian Paisley as a moderating influence on the Northern Ireland peace process. Farmers have never been the most optimistic of people, and I have never been more grateful than now that I didn't follow my father's footsteps in that regard. Yet every so often, I come out with a sentiment that sounds just like my dad, such as advising Nicola not to put a window box on that ledge in case it falls on someone in the street and we are sued. </p> <p>\"It feels odd,\" explains King, \"because at the transition point of adolescence you have invested a lot of energy into differentiating yourself from your parents, especially your same-sex parent. It can seem like a refutation of who you were that you've ended up here.\" </p> <p>At 15, I would sup shandy with my dad and late uncle Arthur and be utterly bemused by their constant search for pubs without juke boxes or young people. Now my pals and I find ourselves doing the same; more Last of the Summer Wine than Likely Lads. </p> <p> When you're a teenager, you embarrass your parents. Only the first thing they teach you at Dad School is that the roles must be reversed once your kids have grown up. When I was staggering from party to party in the 1980s and had achieved the fitness level of Shane MacGowan on an off-day, my dad decided to expose me by completing the London Marathon at the age of 58. And how must Harry Enfield, creator of Tory Boy, have felt in 1999 when his dad Edward announced in the Daily Telegraph that William Hague was a fine fellow and he was coming out as a Conservative supporter? </p> <p>Another lesson they teach you at Dad School is that you must advocate completely unsuitable careers for your children. When I was a CND-supporting teenager dreaming of writing the great Essex novel, my dad's top three career options for me were farming, the army or the police (because, he said, I had the build for it).

      "bodyText": "It is a prospect that terrifies all men. You start taking an unusual interest in A-Zs, wearing clothes that were fashionable 15 years ago and complaining that they don't play any proper songs on Radio 1 any more (\"just that dance stuff without any tunes\"). The merits of taking a Thermos flask to a football match seem suddenly irrefutable. Then, in a moment of exasperation, you shout something at the kids, only the voice that's speaking is not you any more - it's your dad. Be afraid, son, be very afraid. The underrated musical comedian Steve Gribbin has just recorded a very funny song entitled I'm Turning Into My Dad on his new CD In Bulk (Houllier Records). Gribbin reveals how, to his horror, he has started shouting at the TV, turning off electrical appliances at night (\"I asked my dad why he always turned off the video at night, as I always have to reset the clock every morning, and he just said, 'Fire! Great God of Fire come in night kill us all! Come creeping out of the socket like bad magic!' \") and saying things like \"Five ninety-nine for a pair of slip-on shoes? That's more than Gerry and the Pacemakers earn in a year!\" For the chorus Gribbin hollers, \"I like all the furniture in the living room to stay in the same place it's been for years and years/I've got a cavalcade of hair cascading out of my nose and ears/My bladder control's getting bad/I'm turning into my dad!\" It's happening to me, too. I knew as much when I discovered myself paying as much attention to the football news on Ceefax - even the news of new Torquay signings in the round-up on page 312 - as my dad does to the stocks and shares pages. During the Easter holiday, I actually found myself listening to my dad telling me that he had just discovered a button on the remote that froze a Ceefax page. Worse yet, I thought this information both interesting and useful. Since the arrival of my second daughter, I've even acquired my own \"dad's chair\" - with the best view of the telly - that no other family member can sit in. I hear my dad's voice when I advise my partner (only he would never use that word) Nicola to take a tough line with the insurance company over our subsidence claim, to open an Isa at once, and not to leave her computer on all day because they can be struck by lightning. It can only be a short step to developing the capacity - common to all dads - of spending the first 20 minutes after arrival at any destination discussing motorway routes. It is a weird and far from pleasant feeling, this cross-generational migration of souls. So why do men fear - yet perhaps furtively feel reassured by - turning into their dads? \"Psychologists used to think that human development was mostly over by early adulthood, but in the last decade, theories of lifespan developmental psychology have shown that the mid-life transition is a real one,\" says Dr Nigel King, reader in psychology at the University of Huddersfield. \"Men are taken by surprise more than women, as they tend to be more unrealistic about having eternal youth,\" continues King. \"Actually, there have probably been a number of steady incremental changes going on for several years, but men do become aware of them very suddenly. Often it's some other life event, such as turning 40 or the kids going to secondary school, that gives them the cue to think of them selves as middle-aged. They start to think in terms of time left, rather than assuming they have unlimited time - and then they start thinking they've suddenly changed into their dads.\" Indeed, what men really fear is turning into someone they said they would never ever resemble. I might be a Guardian-reading Old Labour hack living in Highbury, but my dad is a Telegraph-reading former farmer who regards Ian Paisley as a moderating influence on the Northern Ireland peace process. Farmers have never been the most optimistic of people, and I have never been more grateful than now that I didn't follow my father's footsteps in that regard. Yet every so often, I come out with a sentiment that sounds just like my dad, such as advising Nicola not to put a window box on that ledge in case it falls on someone in the street and we are sued. \"It feels odd,\" explains King, \"because at the transition point of adolescence you have invested a lot of energy into differentiating yourself from your parents, especially your same-sex parent. It can seem like a refutation of who you were that you've ended up here.\" At 15, I would sup shandy with my dad and late uncle Arthur and be utterly bemused by their constant search for pubs without juke boxes or young people. Now my pals and I find ourselves doing the same; more Last of the Summer Wine than Likely Lads. When you're a teenager, you embarrass your parents. Only the first thing they teach you at Dad School is that the roles must be reversed once your kids have grown up. When I was staggering from party to party in the 1980s and had achieved the fitness level of Shane MacGowan on an off-day, my dad decided to expose me by completing the London Marathon at the age of 58. And how must Harry Enfield, creator of Tory Boy, have felt in 1999 when his dad Edward announced in the Daily Telegraph that William Hague was a fine fellow and he was coming out as a Conservative supporter? Another lesson they teach you at Dad School is that you must advocate completely unsuitable careers for your children. When I was a CND-supporting teenager dreaming of writing the great Essex novel, my dad's top three career options for me were farming, the army or the police (because, he said, I had the build for it). I mean, didn't he notice anything else about me? Only I now know that, in 15 years' time, I too will be offering completely unsuitable careers advice to my daughters. When they are both set on a career in the police force or farming, I'll be advising them of the merits of dropping out and becoming tree-hugging hippies. I suppose it's even possible that my kids might be embarrassed at having a dad whose main hobbies are football programme collecting, visiting stone circles, imitating Alfred Wainwright on the Lakeland fells and watching Doctor Who videos. Is this all we men have to look forward to - a dodgy prostate and turning into the man who created us? Thankfully, there is some hope left. \"If you have a positive relationship with your dad, it can be a sign of reassurance that you resemble him,\" says Dr King. \"If you don't, it can still be a sign of psychological health that, although you recognise certain physical and personality traits, you don't have to be trapped by the confines of your family.

Five years ago, less than 1% of babies in the county were in cotton nappies; now 750 children (5%) are part of the scheme.

      "bodyText": "Don't forget our story-writing competition for children. In case you need prompting, here are Jacqueline Wilson's tips for budding authors: 1. Enjoy writing. It's supposed to be fun. 2. You don't have to write your story in one go - you can do it a bit at a time. 3. Think hard about your characters - pretend you really know them. 4. Write as if you are telling the story to a friend. It's more immediate that way. 5. Don't write any old thing just to fill up the page (though all writers do this sometimes). 6. Try to have an interesting beginning, don't let the story sag in the middle and round everything off neatly at the end. 7. Good luck! \u0095 For details of the competition, go to BOL and follow the link to Jacqueline Wilson's new story, The Worry Website. Closing date: May 11.",

      "body": "<p>When the phone rings at 5 in the morning, it's never going to be good news. When you have a child ill in hospital, you wake with the gut-wrenching nausea of cold dread. Danny, my husband, threw himself into jeans and shoes, picked up the car keys and stumbled out into the breaking dawn, leaving me alone with my sleeping son and daughter to wait for the call that would tell me I could relax. I believe, though, that a mother's soul knows. The world felt different; I could sense the absence of my son's heartbeat in it. When Danny called, he just said: \"He's gone.\" </p> <p>Theo and his identical twin Felix had been born seven months and one day earlier. They were a puzzle from the beginning, full-term infants who responded like premature babies. </p> <p>They were tested for every conceivable condition and disorder, with countless doctors none the wiser as to why they failed to thrive. At three months, they had gastrostomies - little tubes fitted in their tummies to allow us to bypass their practically non-existent swallow at each feed. But feeding was not their only difficulty; breathing, too, was a struggle. For seven months we had run the gauntlet of pneumonias, collapsed lungs, respiratory viruses and endless bugs. Felix and Theo were in and out of paediatric intensive care units (PICU), on and off ventilators, with and without oxygen. In seven long months, we had managed to get three weeks at home with Felix, two weeks with Theo, and a blessed four days with them both together. </p> <p>Despite all this, our boys, our beautiful, beloved boys, were delightful children, full of smiles and charm and absolutely besotted with each other. As the hospital days turned into weeks and then months, Danny and I found ourselves living a bizarre double life with two children in hospital and two at home. Of course, one adjusts, and we developed a routine of sorts. We were fortunate in living very close to both University College Hospital (UCH) and Great Ormond Street, and I was able to walk home for dinner after Theo and Felix's bathtime each night. As winter approached, we began to realise how vulnerable the babies were. They were termed \"medically fragile\". I don't think the reality of the label hit us until much later. </p> <p>The last time I saw Theo alive, I had kissed him gently as he lay in his cot. He had a rotten cold that was getting into his chest. Felix had already been shipped out of UCH into PICU, but Theo seemed to be holding his own this time. That night, though, he went first into respiratory arrest and then, as attempts were made to intubate, into cardiac arrest. They telephoned us as they were performing CPR. He never came back. By the time Danny arrived at the hospital, Theo had been pronounced dead. </p> <p>The clarity of my recall of that morning is startling. The short, numb drive from my house to the hospital; the anguished look on the face of the nurse who held him for me until I arrived; kissing the forehead of my still-warm baby; holding him to me for the last time; handing him, finally, over to the hospital, who took him away, leaving me, my husband and my mother to sit in silence together, each wrapped in the beginnings of our own grief. Even now, the realisation that this day is truly a part of my history shocks me. It seems an event far too big to be encompassed by an ordinary human life. </p> <p>The following days, as we did all the things that have to be done - registering the death; arranging a funeral; choosing an outfit to bury him in and some favourite toys to accompany him; letting people know; receiving the uncomprehending grief of others - were eerily calm. I felt my Theo so very close to me during that time, as if he carried me through. I could hear him laugh and feel his little fingers on my face as though he hovered, just out of sight, like a playful angel finally free of his earthly burdens. </p> <p>His brother Felix was kept sedated and on a ventilator, fighting for life and, so it seemed, dimly aware of a terrible loss. Even through the haze of drugs, he would thrash and cry. I don't know when or how he made the decision to stay with us rather than join his soul mate, but I know it was a close thing for a while. </p> <p>I saw Theo just one more time. I made the decision to visit him in the hospital chapel. I had walked away from the hospital on the morning of his death in shock, and I knew that could not be my final goodbye. The hospital morgue is a grim place. While I cannot say that they were disrespectful of my son's body and of our loss, nevertheless it pained me to see him in those dingy surroundings. This time, his skin was icy as I kissed him. I wish that I had thought to take a lock of hair, but I didn't. It is one of my few regrets. </p> <p>Being a mixed-faith family (my husband is Jewish; I am not) left us stranded in a no man's land as far as funeral arrangements went. Over the next few days Danny and I worked together to write a service that would honour our son in a way that was meaningful to us. I am so glad we did that; it held us together and delayed a little longer the moment of letting him go. On the day of Theo's funeral, Danny and I travelled in the hearse with his tiny coffin, our hands touching it while we talked to him on his final journey. As a parent, you never stop that reassuring and soothing, and sweet Theo had never been anywhere except home and hospital in his short little life. </p> <p> I guess we must have laid him to rest in peace properly, because, after the funeral, I couldn't hear his laugh or feel his fingers any more. He had gone and I finally knew what it was to miss him. Of course, there are no words to describe adequately the pain. Sometimes it felt like being in the eye of a storm: all around you a tempest is raging, but somehow, in the place where you stand, all is calm. You can stretch out your fingers a little and the force of the maelstrom almost rips them from you, so you pull back. </p> <p>Little by little, we allowed ourselves to feel our loss; holding it together most of the time with occasional surrender to the waves of sadness. Letting myself touch the pain became almost a luxury that I could only afford to indulge occasionally. I can understand how some parents fall into that loss, lose themselves in it and are unable to return. But I have three other children who need me and it was their presence that saved me from dissolving into my grief. I still cannot comprehend how anyone can cope with the loss of an only child or, God help them, a tragedy that takes all their children. </p> <p>For a long time afterwards, I felt unreal, unsure of how to fit into the world. When such a profound event takes place in one's life it takes a while to adjust one's self-perception, to learn to wear this new garment; for a while I was stunned and adrift. </p> <p>It is nearly 18 months since Theo died and I have learned to wear the garment almost invisibly. The pain changes and mellows and that, of itself, brings mixed emotions. I know that \"getting over it\" and \"moving on\" are healthy, but there's a sadness even that the waning of grief takes me further and further from my beautiful boy. </p> <p>To lose a child, especially a baby, leaves you with so very little. Seven short months of memories, a handful of days. No matter how fierce the love, it is hard not to feel that, as time passes, Theo is becoming a footnote in our family's history. So what do we do? Build a shrine to keep him ever present in our home? Or let him go, and see that the loss leaves ever fainter ripples because we have to live with the living, no matter how much we long for the dead? </p> <p>I choose to honour my son with happiness. I show my children that we are a complete family. I want them to grow up thinking of their brother as a gift we had, rather than as a loss we mourn. As his mother I miss him every single day, and I will not see his life wasted. </p> <p>\u0095 One Step at a Time: Mourning a Child (Floris, \u00a36.99), by Betty Madill, is published this week.

Exasperated by 'problems - all in the minds of parents', Tony sought, and found, a career outside teaching.</p> <p> Of course, it is normal for parents to be concerned about the well-being of their children. Parental anxiety is nothing new. A brief inspection of the pages of The Nursery World from the 1920's and 1930's shows that our grandparents were haunted by many of the doubts, worries and preoccupations that torment fathers and mothers today. A frequently revised topic was: 'Is my child's development normal? Child tantrums, shyness, aggression, jealousy, thumb-sucking, nail-biting, refusal to sleep, were regularly raised in letters from concerned parents. Many begged an answer to what the publication's agony aunt called 'a problem as old as parenthood itself - that of how to get to obey us'.</p> <p> It might seem that not much has changed. But the superficial similarities betray some big differences, in the past, parental anxiety focused on the problems within the family. Infant health - physical, psychological and moral - was an important preoccupation as was preparing children for the outside world - school, career, marriage. And of course, the older generation was often anxious about their children falling in with bad company and generally 'getting up to no good'. But the concerns raised by our grandparents were voiced in a different tone from today.</p> <p> Reading the worries of parents published in the 1920s, the overall impression is something like this: 'Family life is fine, but there is just this one little thing that we need to sort out.' Today the discussions in parenting magazines suggests that family life is far from fine, that most parents feel out of control and that everything is up for question. Instead of a specific concern, parents seem to be suffering a more general loss of confidence.</p> <p> The parents who write in magazines today do not give the impression that they are troubled by one aspect of child-rearing. Many seem overwhelmed by the sheer scale of troublesome issues confronting them. These days it seems that every little issue - how to toilet-train a child, when you can leave them home alone, whether to force them to eat their greens - is made into a bigger problem by an overall crisis of parental nerve. This suggests that there must have been some major changes in the way that adults negotiate the task of looking after youngsters. The clearest symptom of this trend is the public panic about child safety.</p> <p> In recent years, no issue has come under close scrutiny than the question of children's safety. It has become so highly charged that a single incident can spark a major public debate and demands for new regulations. For example, the tragic murder of an English teenage girl while visiting France on an organized school exchange led to a major review of the safety of school trips - despite the fact that the incident was clearly a one-off event. There is no evidence of any increase in attacks on foreign (or French) students in France, and it is unlikely that such an attack will take place again regardless of whether the authorities take new precautionary measures or not. Such measures may make parents feel better, but a murderer intent on getting into a dormitory will probably do so as easily in France as he would in England. Thankfully, such outrages happen rarely - not because of security measures recommended by educational establishments, but because only a tiny number of people are motivated to commit such atrocities. In truth, a 15-year-old girl is probably far safer in a dormitory in St Gerbais than in her 18-year-old boyfriend's Ford Fiesta on the M25.</p> <p> Public concern with safety has reached obsessive proportions. The remote possibility that children might choke on small toys in packets of cereals, chocolates and crisps has provoked demands to ban them. There is no evidence that any child has ever choked to death - but the theoretical possibility that one just might do so one day in undeniable, and that is sufficient to justify the call for a ban. Baby walkers, which have been used for years to allow infants to whiz about before they can walk alone, have been condemned because of the possibility that children may topple over or fall down the stairs. Admittedly this danger is more 'real' than that of death by Pokemon-card ingestion, but it is still triggered by the potential risk that something might happen, and not by specific evidence that it has.</p> <p> Once in place, parental paranoia easily attaches itself to any new experience concerning children. Take in vitro fertilization (IVF) - for many the only root to parenthood. Rather than celebrating the potential of IVF to cerate wanted children, researches have recently warned about hypothetical dangers to the children being given life. There have been warnings that IVF could induce changes in children's genetic make-up and impair their mental development. There has been speculation about whether sperm that have to be assisted to fertilize an egg will produce babies as healthy as sperm that can swim on their own. Psychologists muse about whether people who become parents by artificial means after years of infertility will be able to relate, in an emotionally stable manner, to their much-wanted children. It has even been suggested that IVF children will be loved too much and may not be able to live up to their parents' hopes for them. It is only a matter of time before the fertile imagination succeeds in turning IVF into a child safety issue.</p> <p> The internet has a remarkable potential to enhance young people's lives by providing educational opportunities. Yet it is widely seen as another new technology that poses new dangers to children. Much of the discussion about the World Wide Web has focused on how to protect young people from the perils, to prevent innocents stumbling across 'adult' sites or into the clutches of paedophiles. 'The Internet can be a big and dangerous place for children, but for the price of a phone call, it needn't be', promises a newspaper advertisement for an Internet provider specializing in protecting children in cyberspace. Such manipulative marketing schemes are confident that they can convert parental paranoia into hard cash.</p> <p> Sadly, virtual reality provides infinite space for the exercise of the anxious imagination, an unknown world where our fear of invisible strangers can run riot. Since children are often more adept at negotiating the net, parental control is forced to confront uncomfortable new challenges. 'You don't know what's out there', a group of fathers confided in me. One raised the spectre of paedophile rings lurking in the shadows online, ready to pounce on his unsuspecting teenagers by e-mail. Nobody I talked to had actually heard of any child being damaged, but nevertheless they regarded the Internet as a really big problem. As one parents' guide to the Internet warns: 'You might think you have taken adequate steps to protect your child, but please be aware that a determined child might nonetheless be able to circumvent any protective software or security measure. And apparently there are other risks to worry about. A London conference on parenting in April 2000 was informed by Dr Jane Healy, and American educational psychologist, that computers can also damage children's brain development.</p> <p> Old-fashioned television is often indicted for its negative impact on children. Parents complain that television is teaching their children to be violent shopaholics. They protest that video games distract children form reading or riding a bike. Even parents who rely on the VCR to keep their children busy feel guilty about their pragmatic embrace of the electronic baby-sitter. The experts encourage these concerns. One American study warns that the impact of the media on children 'should be eliciting serious concern, not just from parents and educators but from physicians, public health advocates, and politicians as well'. Parents are encouraged to blame television because, in a world where they already feel pretty powerless, yet another outside influence on their children is experienced as a threat to their authority.</p> <p> Parents mistrust the Internet and television because of a more general unease about having to cope with external influences that bear upon their children. Many of these influences - television advertising, consumerism, the Internet - are portrayed as part of a complex new world that is causing parental insecurity. But adult over-reaction to new technology is a symptom, and not the cause of the problem. Many parents now feel so insecure and fearful of what they do not understand that virtually anything can be turned into a potential childcare crisis.</p> <p> Fear of children's safety has come to dominate the parenting landscape. In 1998 the advocacy group Families for Freedom interviewed 200 parents. The results make frightening reading. Most of these parents paint a picture of a world that is hostile territory for their children. They routinely use words like 'scared' and 'frightened' to describe their feelings about their children, particularly where they are outdoors. When the marketing organization System Three surveyed public opinion on the safety of children in Scotland for the BBC in 1998, the results suggested an overwhelming sense that children were far less safe than 20 years ago. Although the incidence of child murder by a stranger in Scotland is very low and has shown no change in the past 20 years, 76 per cent of respondents thought that there had been an increase in such tragedies, while 38 per cent believed that the increase had been 'dramatic'. A large majority - 83 per cent - also thought that more children were now being knocked down by traffic on the roads of Scotland. In fact the incidence of road injuries to children had decreased by 60 per cent during the previous 20 years. The gap between adult perceptions and the reality of the risks faced by children is confirmed by other studies in the Anglo-American world. A survey of US paediatricians carried out in 1995 claimed that parental anxieties tended to be significantly out of proportion to many real risks.

A report published by the Children's Play Council in 1997 argued that children had become virtual prisoners in their own homes.</p> <p> Paranoid parenting does not only restrict children's freedom to play. It also diminishes the creative aspect of play. There is considerable evidence that children are more creative when their parents are not around to monitor their behaviour. A study by Dale Grubb and Alicia Snyder concludes that adult supervision turns play into a structured activity and that this weakens youngsters' drive to experiment. Unfortunately, the concept of unsupervised children's activity - what used to be called play - is now defined by child professionals as a risk. Restricting children's outdoor activity has predictable consequences for their development, and a sedentary lifestyle is inevitably bad for their health. Research has linked the decline in British children's fitness to the decrease in the amount of time they spend walking and cycling. The First National Travel Survey reported a fall of about 20 per cent in the annual distance walked and 27 per cent in the distance cycled by children between 1985 and 1993. An average British schoolgirl now walks for less than seven minutes a day. Deprived of the opportunity to burn calories by racing around outside, children grow fat. A study published in the British Medical Journal in September found an alarming proportion of pre-school children to be overweight and even obese. Among those aged 2, 15.8 per cent were considered overweight and 6 per cent obese. By the time they reached 5, 18.7 were deemed overweight and 7.2 per cent obese.</p> <p><a href=\"http://books.theguardian.com/firstchapters/story/0,6761,478362,00.html\">Continue</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony is giving up teaching. Although he would not use the words, it was 'parental paranoia' that drove him out of the West Sussex primary school where he had taught for three years. During his teacher training, Tony had anticipated that he might be stretched by the challenge of dealing with rowdy children. But he was not prepared for the task of coping with 'difficult' anxious parents. The most taxing moments of his working life were to be spent dealing with 'worried mums'. He sighs as he tells of the mother who insisted on driving behind her son's coach to France to ensure that he arrived safely. He wearily recalls how a school trip to the seaside, planned for a class of 5-year-olds was cancelled because two parents were concerned that the trip would involve their children in a 45-minute journey in a private car. Would the cars be roadworthy? Who would accompany a child to the lavatory? Who would ensure correct fitting seat belts? Were these normally non-smoking cars, or would the children be made victims of passive smoking? The planned pirate's day on the beach ended up being confined to the school field - sea, sand and adventure confined to their imagination and many of its education aims undermined. Exasperated by 'problems - all in the minds of parents', Tony sought, and found, a career outside teaching. Of course, it is normal for parents to be concerned about the well-being of their children. Parental anxiety is nothing new. A brief inspection of the pages of The Nursery World from the 1920's and 1930's shows that our grandparents were haunted by many of the doubts, worries and preoccupations that torment fathers and mothers today. A frequently revised topic was: 'Is my child's development normal? Child tantrums, shyness, aggression, jealousy, thumb-sucking, nail-biting, refusal to sleep, were regularly raised in letters from concerned parents. Many begged an answer to what the publication's agony aunt called 'a problem as old as parenthood itself - that of how to get to obey us'. It might seem that not much has changed. But the superficial similarities betray some big differences, in the past, parental anxiety focused on the problems within the family. Infant health - physical, psychological and moral - was an important preoccupation as was preparing children for the outside world - school, career, marriage. And of course, the older generation was often anxious about their children falling in with bad company and generally 'getting up to no good'. But the concerns raised by our grandparents were voiced in a different tone from today. Reading the worries of parents published in the 1920s, the overall impression is something like this: 'Family life is fine, but there is just this one little thing that we need to sort out.' Today the discussions in parenting magazines suggests that family life is far from fine, that most parents feel out of control and that everything is up for question. Instead of a specific concern, parents seem to be suffering a more general loss of confidence. The parents who write in magazines today do not give the impression that they are troubled by one aspect of child-rearing. Many seem overwhelmed by the sheer scale of troublesome issues confronting them. These days it seems that every little issue - how to toilet-train a child, when you can leave them home alone, whether to force them to eat their greens - is made into a bigger problem by an overall crisis of parental nerve. This suggests that there must have been some major changes in the way that adults negotiate the task of looking after youngsters. The clearest symptom of this trend is the public panic about child safety. In recent years, no issue has come under close scrutiny than the question of children's safety. It has become so highly charged that a single incident can spark a major public debate and demands for new regulations. For example, the tragic murder of an English teenage girl while visiting France on an organized school exchange led to a major review of the safety of school trips - despite the fact that the incident was clearly a one-off event. There is no evidence of any increase in attacks on foreign (or French) students in France, and it is unlikely that such an attack will take place again regardless of whether the authorities take new precautionary measures or not. Such measures may make parents feel better, but a murderer intent on getting into a dormitory will probably do so as easily in France as he would in England. Thankfully, such outrages happen rarely - not because of security measures recommended by educational establishments, but because only a tiny number of people are motivated to commit such atrocities. In truth, a 15-year-old girl is probably far safer in a dormitory in St Gerbais than in her 18-year-old boyfriend's Ford Fiesta on the M25. Public concern with safety has reached obsessive proportions. The remote possibility that children might choke on small toys in packets of cereals, chocolates and crisps has provoked demands to ban them. There is no evidence that any child has ever choked to death - but the theoretical possibility that one just might do so one day in undeniable, and that is sufficient to justify the call for a ban. Baby walkers, which have been used for years to allow infants to whiz about before they can walk alone, have been condemned because of the possibility that children may topple over or fall down the stairs. Admittedly this danger is more 'real' than that of death by Pokemon-card ingestion, but it is still triggered by the potential risk that something might happen, and not by specific evidence that it has. Once in place, parental paranoia easily attaches itself to any new experience concerning children. Take in vitro fertilization (IVF) - for many the only root to parenthood. Rather than celebrating the potential of IVF to cerate wanted children, researches have recently warned about hypothetical dangers to the children being given life. There have been warnings that IVF could induce changes in children's genetic make-up and impair their mental development. There has been speculation about whether sperm that have to be assisted to fertilize an egg will produce babies as healthy as sperm that can swim on their own. Psychologists muse about whether people who become parents by artificial means after years of infertility will be able to relate, in an emotionally stable manner, to their much-wanted children. It has even been suggested that IVF children will be loved too much and may not be able to live up to their parents' hopes for them. It is only a matter of time before the fertile imagination succeeds in turning IVF into a child safety issue. The internet has a remarkable potential to enhance young people's lives by providing educational opportunities. Yet it is widely seen as another new technology that poses new dangers to children. Much of the discussion about the World Wide Web has focused on how to protect young people from the perils, to prevent innocents stumbling across 'adult' sites or into the clutches of paedophiles. 'The Internet can be a big and dangerous place for children, but for the price of a phone call, it needn't be', promises a newspaper advertisement for an Internet provider specializing in protecting children in cyberspace. Such manipulative marketing schemes are confident that they can convert parental paranoia into hard cash. Sadly, virtual reality provides infinite space for the exercise of the anxious imagination, an unknown world where our fear of invisible strangers can run riot. Since children are often more adept at negotiating the net, parental control is forced to confront uncomfortable new challenges. 'You don't know what's out there', a group of fathers confided in me. One raised the spectre of paedophile rings lurking in the shadows online, ready to pounce on his unsuspecting teenagers by e-mail. Nobody I talked to had actually heard of any child being damaged, but nevertheless they regarded the Internet as a really big problem. As one parents' guide to the Internet warns: 'You might think you have taken adequate steps to protect your child, but please be aware that a determined child might nonetheless be able to circumvent any protective software or security measure. And apparently there are other risks to worry about. A London conference on parenting in April 2000 was informed by Dr Jane Healy, and American educational psychologist, that computers can also damage children's brain development. Old-fashioned television is often indicted for its negative impact on children. Parents complain that television is teaching their children to be violent shopaholics. They protest that video games distract children form reading or riding a bike. Even parents who rely on the VCR to keep their children busy feel guilty about their pragmatic embrace of the electronic baby-sitter. The experts encourage these concerns. One American study warns that the impact of the media on children 'should be eliciting serious concern, not just from parents and educators but from physicians, public health advocates, and politicians as well'. Parents are encouraged to blame television because, in a world where they already feel pretty powerless, yet another outside influence on their children is experienced as a threat to their authority. Parents mistrust the Internet and television because of a more general unease about having to cope with external influences that bear upon their children. Many of these influences - television advertising, consumerism, the Internet - are portrayed as part of a complex new world that is causing parental insecurity. But adult over-reaction to new technology is a symptom, and not the cause of the problem. Many parents now feel so insecure and fearful of what they do not understand that virtually anything can be turned into a potential childcare crisis. Fear of children's safety has come to dominate the parenting landscape. In 1998 the advocacy group Families for Freedom interviewed 200 parents. The results make frightening reading. Most of these parents paint a picture of a world that is hostile territory for their children. They routinely use words like 'scared' and 'frightened' to describe their feelings about their children, particularly where they are outdoors. When the marketing organization System Three surveyed public opinion on the safety of children in Scotland for the BBC in 1998, the results suggested an overwhelming sense that children were far less safe than 20 years ago. Although the incidence of child murder by a stranger in Scotland is very low and has shown no change in the past 20 years, 76 per cent of respondents thought that there had been an increase in such tragedies, while 38 per cent believed that the increase had been 'dramatic'. A large majority - 83 per cent - also thought that more children were now being knocked down by traffic on the roads of Scotland. In fact the incidence of road injuries to children had decreased by 60 per cent during the previous 20 years. The gap between adult perceptions and the reality of the risks faced by children is confirmed by other studies in the Anglo-American world. A survey of US paediatricians carried out in 1995 claimed that parental anxieties tended to be significantly out of proportion to many real risks. The discrepancy between actual and imagined risks was particularly striking in relation to the dramatic issues of child welfare, such as abduction, environmental poisons and cancer. A culture of fear has led parents to restrict their children's independent outdoor activities. In 1971, eight out of ten 8-year-olds were allowed to walk to school alone. Now it is fewer than one in ten. At age II almost every child used to walk, now it is down to 55 per cent and falling. A report published by the Children's Play Council in 1997 argued that children had become virtual prisoners in their own homes. Paranoid parenting does not only restrict children's freedom to play. It also diminishes the creative aspect of play. There is considerable evidence that children are more creative when their parents are not around to monitor their behaviour. A study by Dale Grubb and Alicia Snyder concludes that adult supervision turns play into a structured activity and that this weakens youngsters' drive to experiment. Unfortunately, the concept of unsupervised children's activity - what used to be called play - is now defined by child professionals as a risk. Restricting children's outdoor activity has predictable consequences for their development, and a sedentary lifestyle is inevitably bad for their health.

As a census district manager I get a daily printout of the calls that apparently require action for my area. In the first week of enumeration I had three demanding to know why they'd not had a form yet. Today I got one that said an occupant was going to be away till the end of May... so post the form early, and join the 1,000 or so that have already been posted back in my area, despite instructions to wait! Out of 10 calls so far, only four have required action. If this is the general experience, no wonder the lines are not holding out.

      "bodyText": "Journalists at the Express will be balloted for strike action early next week following a breakdown in talks between management and the NUJ over terms and conditions. And the union is to consider writing to management at the paper to ask for the editorial board to be suspended, following fresh allegations of editorial interference. Earlier this week, representatives of the NUJ walked out of the meeting with the newspaper's departing managing editor, Lindsay Cook, the deputy managing editor, Alex Bannister, and the legal representative, Naomi Hirans. The NUJ's newspaper organiser, Jeremy Dear, told MediaGuardian.co.uk talks had broken down after the Express failed to address a series of demands made by the union. Mr Dear said Express Newspapers management had failed to provide answers to a series of questions. The union had asked for the current redundancy terms to be extended beyond their December deadline. The terms provide for as much as 20 times the statutory redundancy payment and Express Newspapers wants to cut this back. The union called for guarantees that staff would be given Express Newspapers contracts as opposed to Northern &amp; Shell contracts, which offer poorer holiday and sick pay terms. The NUJ also wants Express Newspapers to provide some sort of remuneration for staff who remain at the paper after the departure of so many of their colleagues. The union also wants details of how the redundancies will affect the newspaper's Scottish offices. \"We asked them to provide recognition that people were doing extra work and should be compensated accordingly,\" Mr Dear. Over the course of the past few weeks, more than 130 staff have volunteered for fast-track redundancy. The most recent high-profile journalist to leave the paper is Nigel Billen, the Saturday features editor, who will leave the paper at the end of April. Meanwhile, the NUJ is \"strongly considering\" writing to Express Newspapers to ask for the dissolution of the editorial board, which comprises Arthur Davidson, Jonathan Holborow and Louise Chase. Insiders claim Express owner Richard Desmond has continued to interfere with editorial policy making, particularly on the business pages. It is claimed he asked business journalists on the Sunday Express to run two negative pieces about the Telegraph Group and Emap and a positive piece on Mohamed Al Fayed. An Express Newspapers spokesman said: \"We have a full consultation period of 90 days. Redundancy terms are far superior to the legal minimum.\" He added the Express Newspapers editorial board had been appointed for a two-year term.

      "trailText": "<p>With yesterday's news that Gerard Butler is the latest young actor  'hotly tipped' to be the next James Bond when Irish actor Pierce Brosnan hangs up his tuxedo, Emma Yates takes a closer look at some of those rumoured to be in the running for the coveted role of Britain's favourite  spy</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Bond writer Ian Fleming was very clear what his British secret agent creation looked like. His Bond was:\"6'2\" tall, 167 pounds, slim build, blue eyes, black hair, scar down right cheek, straight nose, cruel mouth, firm jawline, flecks of grey hair, and tanned.\" For many others, James Bond will always be Sean Connery, although there are many who will argue in favour of Brosnan's turn as the suave spy. It is seems that Brosnan's next Bond, the 20th in the franchise, is to be his last, and speculation is rife as to who will be chosen to replace him. Ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous, we survey the possible candidates.</p> <p><strong>Greg Wise</strong><br> Way back in 1999, Wise, he of Sense and Sensibility and Emma Thompson's other half fame was rumoured to be the main contender. \"It would be great to do it,\" he said at the time \"The producers saw me after Timothy Dalton left, but I had these very unsexy sideburns for some period thing, which spoilt my chances.\" </p> <p><strong>Robbie Williams</strong><br> The Robster threw his hat into the ring back in November 1999 when a 'source' close to the singer told the Sunday Times that he was willing to take extensive acting lessons and give up his music career for the chance of winning the role. However the 26-year-old's dreams will have been dashed yesterday when the casting director for the world famous series told internet radio station <a href=\"http://www.netfm.com\" target=\"_NEW\">netfm.com</a> \"Robbie Williams, bless him - I don't think is quite what we're looking for.\"</p> <p><strong>Rupert Everett</strong><br> Madonna's best mate and longtime LA resident Everett announced his interest in the role last year in typical style: \"I want to be James Bond\". He probably didn't help his chances when he criticised current Bond, Brosnan claiming, \"He's a shop girl, someone you'd see in a department store. He looks like James Bond's florist. He's just not ruthless enough.\" Everett's well-known homosexuality would add an interesting dimension to Bond's famous womanising ways... alternatively the producers might take the opportunity to well and truly bring Bond into the 21st century.</p> <p><strong>Ioan Gruffudd</strong><br> The first Welsh Bond? The 26-year-old heartthrob, best known for his role in the BBC's Hornblower, was recently mooted as a future 007, but claimed \"It's all hearsay. I would love to do it, though. I'd absolutely love it - I'd be in there like a shot. \"Maybe we could go back in time a bit, back to his young life, back to his SAS training.\" His recent turn as a drippy boy scout and friend of all dumb animals in 102 Dalmatians can not have helped his prospects.</p> <p><strong>Catherine Zeta-Jones</strong><br> More Jane than James, reports earlier this year claimed that the 31-year-old actress had been screen-tested for the role and was the number one choice.

      "bodyText": "Bond writer Ian Fleming was very clear what his British secret agent creation looked like. His Bond was:\"6'2\" tall, 167 pounds, slim build, blue eyes, black hair, scar down right cheek, straight nose, cruel mouth, firm jawline, flecks of grey hair, and tanned.\" For many others, James Bond will always be Sean Connery, although there are many who will argue in favour of Brosnan's turn as the suave spy. It is seems that Brosnan's next Bond, the 20th in the franchise, is to be his last, and speculation is rife as to who will be chosen to replace him. Ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous, we survey the possible candidates. Greg Wise Way back in 1999, Wise, he of Sense and Sensibility and Emma Thompson's other half fame was rumoured to be the main contender. \"It would be great to do it,\" he said at the time \"The producers saw me after Timothy Dalton left, but I had these very unsexy sideburns for some period thing, which spoilt my chances.\" Robbie Williams The Robster threw his hat into the ring back in November 1999 when a 'source' close to the singer told the Sunday Times that he was willing to take extensive acting lessons and give up his music career for the chance of winning the role. However the 26-year-old's dreams will have been dashed yesterday when the casting director for the world famous series told internet radio station netfm.com \"Robbie Williams, bless him - I don't think is quite what we're looking for.\" Rupert Everett Madonna's best mate and longtime LA resident Everett announced his interest in the role last year in typical style: \"I want to be James Bond\". He probably didn't help his chances when he criticised current Bond, Brosnan claiming, \"He's a shop girl, someone you'd see in a department store. He looks like James Bond's florist. He's just not ruthless enough.\" Everett's well-known homosexuality would add an interesting dimension to Bond's famous womanising ways... alternatively the producers might take the opportunity to well and truly bring Bond into the 21st century. Ioan Gruffudd The first Welsh Bond? The 26-year-old heartthrob, best known for his role in the BBC's Hornblower, was recently mooted as a future 007, but claimed \"It's all hearsay. I would love to do it, though. I'd absolutely love it - I'd be in there like a shot. \"Maybe we could go back in time a bit, back to his young life, back to his SAS training.\" His recent turn as a drippy boy scout and friend of all dumb animals in 102 Dalmatians can not have helped his prospects. Catherine Zeta-Jones More Jane than James, reports earlier this year claimed that the 31-year-old actress had been screen-tested for the role and was the number one choice. Studio executives were reported to have enthused: \"She is feisty, independent and beautiful. A deadly combination for a glamorous spy. Schedule permitting, she's our girl.\" Russell Crowe The highest profile of the candidates, Crowe's recent Oscar win perhaps makes him too big a star for the role. His antipodean roots could also be a problem (George Lazenby anyone?). John Glen, the man who has directed five of the Bond movies, reportedly believes that Crowe is the 'only man' who could take over the licence to kill. \"I see the Bond movies going on for another 20 years and I can't think of anyone better than Russell to fill his shoes.\" Colin Firth Currently wowing cinema audiences as the mean and moody hero of Bridget Jones's Diary, Firth is reportedly 'desperate' to play 007, admitting he would jump at the chance to replace Brosnan. \"I'd go for it, absolutely! I'd love the idea,\" he told reporters. Cuba Gooding Jr The first potential black Bond has got the thumbs up from Roger Moore who believes the Jerry Maguire star would be perfect for the role. Martin Kemp The Eastenders actor and ex Spandau Ballet member, who had his screen debut playing Reggie Cray, was rumoured earlier this year to be under consideration. Andrew Collins, writing in the Observer in July 1999, came up with some interesting options for a 21st century Bond. \"Ewan McGregor will be 31 by then - close to Bond's age in the books - and with the Scots heritage that served Connery so well, he has to be any producer's first choice...

      "bodyText": "A calf which has been found alive under a pile of animal carcases five days after they were incinerated may have escaped the foot and mouth cull. It is thought the white heifer Phoenix was not spotted by slaughtermen, who were administering lethal injections to the herd, as she was standing under her mother. The workers destroyed all the other animals at Michaela Board's farm in Membury, East Devon. Now Mrs Board, whose farm borders another which has the disease, is pleading with officials to allow Phoenix to remain alive. The calf shows no signs of foot and mouth disease. \"The calf was found when groundsmen came to disinfect carcasses,\" Ms Board said. \"She was lying next to her mum.\" Mrs Board who runs the farm with her husband Philip, says the calf must have survived by living off straw that was in the barn. The farmer has bottle fed Phoenix who is slowly recovering from the ordeal. \"She has been out playing with dogs and is feeding very well,\" she said. \"The vets have checked her out and will be back later in the week. I'm hopeful she is going to make it.\" A Ministry of Agriculture official confirmed blood samples have been taken from the calf. Tests take several days and if Phoenix is cleared the ministry could exempt her from the cull under \"exceptional\" circumstances.

      "body": "<p>An England football fan today lost his appeal against a conviction for assaulting Brussels police during Euro 2000, but vowed to fight on and clear his name. </p> <p>Mark Forrester, 34, said he had been made a scapegoat by a corrupt Belgian justice system. \"I am shocked but not surprised. This should have been over today. Instead we are just entering another stage of the battle. But I am really confident I will prove my innocence in the end.\" </p> <p>He said his lawyer is planning to take the case to the highest appeal court in Belgium - the equivalent of the House of Lords - and then on to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. </p> <p>Mr Forrester, an Aston Villa fan, was speaking after a Brussels appeal court judge today backed the evidence of the only witness at the original trial - a Belgian police hooligan \"spotter\" - and rejected video footage produced at the appeal hearing last month. </p> <p>Now his hopes rest on British police video footage of the incident, film it is claimed the Belgian police knew about but refused to accept from the UK authorities. </p> <p>At the original trial last June, days after rioting in central Brussels, the police \"spotter\" said that Mr Forrester deliberately orchestrated trouble, attacking five officers on the eve of the England-Germany match. </p> <p>No defence evidence was allowed - because Mr Forrester was tried under controversial \"fast track\" legal procedures introduced specifically to deal with the expected backlog of riot cases during Euro 2000 . </p> <p>Mr Forrester was given a one-year jail sentence, half of it suspended for three years. The trial judge said there was proof that Forrester had been \"provocative and aggressive\". But the video footage shown at Mr Forrester's insistence during the appeal hearing last month revealed no sign of him being a rioting ringleader. It caught him on the fringe of trouble which flared in Brussels. </p> <p>After it was shown, the public prosecutor expressed doubt about the conviction and sentence, saying the case was not suitable for the \"fast track\" approach. </p> <p>Today the appeal court judges announced that they were still upholding the sentence and conviction, describing the police evidence as \"objective\". They pointed out that although the video did not \"one hundred per cent\" prove that Mr Forrester was involved in rioting, it failed to show conclusively that he was not. </p> <p>Afterwards Mr Forrester's lawyer, Jan Fermon, said the rule of law had been turned upside down and an appeal would be lodged within 15 days. The normal procedure, he said, was for the prosecution to prove guilt and not for the defence to prove innocence. </p> <p>Mr Forrester said: \"Anyone with any common sense could see that there is no evidence against me. The video shown in court clearly demonstrated that I was doing nothing wrong. Now we have more ammunition in the form of a British police video - which the Belgian police refused to look at - and we will use it in the next stage of the legal battle. </p> <p>\"It shows the entire arrest sequence that night in Brussels and it proves I did nothing. The Belgian police spotter was not just mistaken, he was lying. There is a conspiracy and I am the scapegoat.\" </p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4161400,00.html\">29.03.2001: Fan likely to be cleared of football violence</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4041798,00.html\">19.07.2000: Belgians free 'riot' soccer fan for appeal</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4033152,00.html\">24.06.2000: Hooligan ringleader jailed</a></p>",

At the original trial last June, days after rioting in central Brussels, the police \"spotter\" said that Mr Forrester deliberately orchestrated trouble, attacking five officers on the eve of the England-Germany match. No defence evidence was allowed - because Mr Forrester was tried under controversial \"fast track\" legal procedures introduced specifically to deal with the expected backlog of riot cases during Euro 2000 . Mr Forrester was given a one-year jail sentence, half of it suspended for three years. The trial judge said there was proof that Forrester had been \"provocative and aggressive\". But the video footage shown at Mr Forrester's insistence during the appeal hearing last month revealed no sign of him being a rioting ringleader. It caught him on the fringe of trouble which flared in Brussels. After it was shown, the public prosecutor expressed doubt about the conviction and sentence, saying the case was not suitable for the \"fast track\" approach. Today the appeal court judges announced that they were still upholding the sentence and conviction, describing the police evidence as \"objective\". They pointed out that although the video did not \"one hundred per cent\" prove that Mr Forrester was involved in rioting, it failed to show conclusively that he was not. Afterwards Mr Forrester's lawyer, Jan Fermon, said the rule of law had been turned upside down and an appeal would be lodged within 15 days. The normal procedure, he said, was for the prosecution to prove guilt and not for the defence to prove innocence. Mr Forrester said: \"Anyone with any common sense could see that there is no evidence against me. The video shown in court clearly demonstrated that I was doing nothing wrong. Now we have more ammunition in the form of a British police video - which the Belgian police refused to look at - and we will use it in the next stage of the legal battle. \"It shows the entire arrest sequence that night in Brussels and it proves I did nothing. The Belgian police spotter was not just mistaken, he was lying. There is a conspiracy and I am the scapegoat.\" Related articles 29.03.2001: Fan likely to be cleared of football violence 19.07.2000: Belgians free 'riot' soccer fan for appeal 24.06.2000: Hooligan ringleader jailed",

Other fallers included venture capital group 3i, off 72p at \u00a312.03, as UBS Warburg lowered its rating to \"hold\" from \"buy\" on the grounds that the stock is now up with events, and Reuters down 65p to 910p, after strong first-quarter figures were overshadowed by cautious comments on prospects for the second half. The banking sector propped the market up. Halifax added 9p to 738p after JP Morgan upgraded the stock to \"buy\". Despite the strong performance of the shares this year, JP Morgan thinks Halifax is undervalued by 20%. Royal Bank of Scotland gained 9p to \u00a316.42, and Bank of Scotland rose 4p to 742p, as HSBC Securities turned buyer ahead of next week's full-year results. HSBC analyst Michael Lever expects the figures to beat City expectations. Telecoms group Cable &amp; Wireless made a late surge, rising 10.5p to 490p on vague chatter of a bid approach. Lower down, the FTSE 250 index closed 5.6 points better at 6,317, with discount retailer Matalan improving 14p to 532p after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its \"recommended list\" of preferred stocks. After its profits warning earlier in the year, Goldman reckons the Matalan growth story is back on track. Sports and advertising company Sportsworld Media finished top of the mid-cap pile, rising 35p to 337.5p, after a line of stock - about 1m shares - that had been overhanging the market was finally cleared. In the smaller companies world, Chapelthorpe, the wall coverings and umbrella frame specialist, climbed 2.5p to 13.75p, after a seller found a home for 5m shares. According to market gossips the buyer was a company director who might use the shares as the platform to launch a bid. Back in March, Chapelthorpe's chief executive, Brian Leckie, had a 32.5p per share offer rejected by the company's independent directors.",

      "bodyText": "The sharp fall in William Hague\u0092s popularity amongst Tory voters - down from 60% to only 49% - revealed in this month\u0092s Guardian/ICM opinion poll is a good guide to the scale of the problems facing the Tory Party leader. The monthly poll findings show that the Tories have failed to make any political capital out of the farming crisis and the row over race has only served to make them look like a party out of control. The more Tory voters desert Hague the more his nearest rivals for the leadership, Widdicombe and Portillo, prepare for the opportunity that post-election defeat will present them. The weakness of Hague\u0092s current position contrasts sharply with that enjoyed by Tony Blair who, on these findings, must be regarded as the only credible party leader in the game. Labour is emerging almost completely politically unscathed from the continuing foot and mouth crisis. It still enjoys a 14 point lead over the Conservatives with a share of the vote which would translate into a Commons majority of 165 if the general election were held tomorrow. In sharp contrast to Hague\u0092s falling popularity amongst Tory voters, some 82% of Labour voters believe Tony Blair makes the best prime minister.

According to the Belfast Telegraph, the ex-Royal Irish Rangers soldier, \"named only as Kevin\", claimed he earned the trust of the IRA after four years of armed robberies, before graduating to making bombs which killed fellow British soldiers and RUC officers in the late 80s and early 90s.</p> <p>\"How can I be a terrorist and not be a terrorist?\", he asks. \"I had to be an IRA man, not just pretend to be one; I had to be one.\" What makes his allegations explosive is his claim that he tipped off his military intelligence handlers of impending bombs which were then not stopped, such as the massive explosion which ripped the heart out of Portadown in 1993.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, unionist politicans interviewed for the programme are livid.

The first to \"out\" the existence of the FRU was Brian Nelson, an ex-serviceman persuaded by the FRU to join the UDA. Nelson was from an impeccable Ulster protestant background and his military experience was valued by the loyalist organisation. By the late 80s, Nelson was the intelligence officer for the UDA's Shankill brigade. It is claimed that Nelson was getting \"accurate\" information about provos which improved the \"targetting\" of the UDA's hit squads, previously happy to stiff any \"fenian\".</p> <p>Among the names given by Nelson for the UDA's attention was the nationalist solicitor Pat Finucane, shot dead in front of his family in February 1989. Afterwards, Nelson claimed he warned his handlers that Finucane was in danger and that nothing was done to prevent the assassination.</p> <p>Republicans read that story in reverse. They see people like Nelson as proof that the FRU treated loyalist paramilitaries as state-sanctioned death squads, by passing state information to killers. The UDA were, republicans repeatedly assert, violent proxies for the British government who were unable or unwilling to let the courts and the justice system deal justice to provos, or those accused of giving quarter to them.</p> <p>A full public inquiry into the Finucane murder and the role of the intelligence services was a core demand of both Sinn Fein and the SDLP during the recent wrangling with the government over whether nationalists would accept the new police service for Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The foremost failure of the FRU lay in its obsessive secrecy. It did not cooperate with any of the other branches of the security system and therefore was not aware that the quartermaster of Nelson's UDA brigade was working for RUC special branch.</p> <p>Nor did Nelson know that when he provided information about a leading IRA figure in west Belfast, that the latter too was in the pay of the FRU. When Nelson told his handlers about the intended \"targetting\" of the IRA man, he was urgently ordered to find another target.</p> <p>\"Steak Knife\" was too valuable to the FRU to be allowed die, and so, a completely innocent catholic, Francisco Noterantonio, was shot dead by UDA killers, believing that this 66-year-old retired taxi-driver was a big-time provo.</p> <p>In recent months, gagging orders have been served on the Sunday Times, Sunday Herald and Sunday People, who fought a long court battle before publishing the \"Steak Knife\" revelations.</p> <p>Today, UTV will start a similar battle in the Belfast courts. Even then, in the event of showing even an amended programme, they may face the part of last evening's injunction which compels them to \"facilitate a viewing for the secretary of state.\" And if Geoff Hoon does not like way he sees, then we may not see it either. Which will facilitate more allegations about the FRU and its \"tradecraft\".

It did not cooperate with any of the other branches of the security system and therefore was not aware that the quartermaster of Nelson's UDA brigade was working for RUC special branch. Nor did Nelson know that when he provided information about a leading IRA figure in west Belfast, that the latter too was in the pay of the FRU. When Nelson told his handlers about the intended \"targetting\" of the IRA man, he was urgently ordered to find another target. \"Steak Knife\" was too valuable to the FRU to be allowed die, and so, a completely innocent catholic, Francisco Noterantonio, was shot dead by UDA killers, believing that this 66-year-old retired taxi-driver was a big-time provo. In recent months, gagging orders have been served on the Sunday Times, Sunday Herald and Sunday People, who fought a long court battle before publishing the \"Steak Knife\" revelations. Today, UTV will start a similar battle in the Belfast courts. Even then, in the event of showing even an amended programme, they may face the part of last evening's injunction which compels them to \"facilitate a viewing for the secretary of state.\" And if Geoff Hoon does not like way he sees, then we may not see it either. Which will facilitate more allegations about the FRU and its \"tradecraft\". Or is there really something to hide? \u0095 John O'Farrell is a correspondent for the Guardian and the Observer and is managing editor of Fortnight magazine.

In this way, there may be better opportunities for investment,\" Mr Dunsmore-Hardy says.</p> <p>\"I would also suggest people look at their repayments rationally, as many people do not factor in things such as new furniture, credit card bills and shopping,\" he says.</p> <p>Mr Dunsmore-Hardy adds that he expects the current burst of activity to slow down and stabilise soon.</p> <p>\"We have seen, periodically, evidence of prices rationalising in some of the more popular areas and this comes down to basic questions of affordability. People's pockets are only so deep and we are not anticipating that we are going to see increases running as high as they were last year or the year before,\" Mr Dunsmore-Hardy says.</p> <p>\"We will soon see prices more restrained and although we might get periods of prices edging forward, that will be coupled with the traditional buying season of spring. Prices, year on year, are only rising at 7 to 8%, which we believe is fairly contained.

But if, for whatever reason, we had a return of rates of interest of up to 8 or 9 %, then, for some people, the difference in mortgage payments could be such that they will find themselves in difficulty,\" Mr Gully says.</p> <p>The Portman property review reflects the state of the busy market with geographical examples. It includes a round-up of:<br></p> <p>\u0095 <strong>London and Southeast</strong> - where a one-bedroom house in Royston, Hertfordshire, is selling for about \u00a3120,000; <br> \u0095 <strong>Southern England </strong>- where a two-bedroom semi in Bournemouth is selling for about \u00a3111,000 and older semis sell for about \u00a3102,500;<br> \u0095 <strong>Southwest England</strong> - where a semi detached house in Plympton, near Plymouth, is now being sold for just over \u00a390,000 (Before Christmas they were fetching about \u00a377,000);<br> \u0095 <strong>The Thames Valley </strong>- where, with the \"rampant inflation\" buyers will be lucky to find anything under \u00a3100,000; </p> <p> \u0095 <strong>The Midlands </strong>- where a 1940s semi-detached in need of refurbishment is selling for about \u00a372,000. </p> <p>Given the significant number of house hunters looking for properties in Southern England, Mr Gully advises first home buyers to consider the lure of the West country. </p> <p>But he also says the real problem for first homebuyers is, primarily, whether or not they have sufficient income to service the borrowing they are looking for, and not whether they are able to buy their dream home in Bournemouth. </p> <p>He says while it's rare for 100% mortgages to be available, borrowers still have to find at least five to 10% minimum as deposit. </p> <p>\"Typically, if a first home buyer was looking to buy at \u00a3100,000 and they had a 5% deposit, they'd be looking at a mortgage of \u00a395,000 which means they need an income of \u00a330,000. When you do the figures and equate the required income, you realise that many first homebuyers are in their early 20s, and the equation starts to break down. There are really not many 20-year-olds earning that amount of money or who could support the repayments,\" Mr Gully says. </p> <p>Mr Gully says that although lenders are keen for first-time buyers' business, he believes they also have a responsibility to the borrowers. He adds that the number of customers who fail to meet their repayments is miniscule.</p> <p>\"As far as Portman is concerned, we have somewhere in the region of 90,000 borrowers and we currently have somewhere in the region of just 24 properties that are in possession because they haven't been able to sustain payments. As for the arrears scenario, we have less than one per cent of mortgage balances in arrears,\" he says.</p> <p>\"We, like many lenders, learnt a salutory lesson in the collapse of the early 90s when people over-extended themselves and then the levels of interest went back to being famously high [at 13 or 14%]. Lenders have a duty to be responsible to their borrowers. We would rather lose the borrower by refusing to give them five times' their income. Why?

If you are buying your first home, the good news is that lenders are desperate to woo you, certain that once they offer you a mortgage you will remain a faithful customer. But the bad news is that buying your first home can be even more expensive than first anticipated. According to HSBC, a third of new home owners don't budget enough money when buying their first home. With Halifax, those with a minimum income of \u00a3100,000 can borrow 4.25 times their income as long as they also get a good credit score. Woolwich lends up to four times income and Abbey National up to 4.2 times, but taking credit scoring into account.",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Tony Blair, is planning to replace the Ministry of Agriculture (Maff) with a new department of rural affairs to fundamentally reform farming, according to newspaper reports today. Maff has been criticised over its handling of the crisis and for promoting a system of intensive farming that many blame for the disease's rapid spread. A reform of the European Union's common agricultural policy, which may be possible with Germany's support for environmentally friendly farming methods, would also remove the subsidies that Maff administers based on the number of animals in a farmer's herd. The environmentally sensitive alternative places greater emphasis on farmers' role as managers of the land. The Prince of Wales, who is currently visiting Canada, wrote yesterday in the country's Globe and Mail newspaper that repeated farming crises may be a \"consequence of the belief by some that, somehow, the quality of our sustenance can in some way be divorced from the well-being of our natural surroundings. \"For as long as we care about our sense of identity and spiritual well-being, I believe we have to ensure that the farmer, who has always brought meat and drink to our table, is able to continue his duty as provider and, equally importantly, as custodian of the countryside,\" he argued. Tourism ministers from England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are today meeting in Glasgow to discuss the economic fallout from the crisis in their industry.

      "bodyText": "The Press Complaints Commission has upheld a complaint against the Sunday Mirror for publishing the address of the former wife of Elton John, Renate Blauel. But the PCC rejected complaints from Ms Blauel that the article, headlined \"Sad, lonely life of the woman who loved and lost Elton John\", represented an invasion of her privacy, harassment and misrepresentation. The article, published in June 2000, compared Ms Blauel's current lifestyle with her experiences with her former husband, and was accompanied by photographs of Ms Blauel in a petrol station forecourt. The commission rejected complaints that Ms Blauel had \"a reasonable expectation of privacy\" in the petrol forecourt. It failed to find evidence of harrassment by Sunday Mirror journalists and ruled that while the complainant may have been insulted by the tone of the article, this was a matter of \"editorial comment\". The adjudication stated: \"It is not the commission's job either to restrict this right or to afford individuals a veto over future publicity.\" It noted that the article had not published any details that could be considered to concern Ms Blauel's private life.",

When our reader tried to cancel, the company threatened to hold on to his deposit. Nor was it chastened when it replied (10 weeks later) to Consumer\u0092s overtures. The customer, it said, was being unreasonable in not giving it more time to chase vital parts. </p> <p><strong>Most effective vanishing act</strong></p> <p>Jointly won by the international removals company Cargo Forwarding, which disappeared leaving scores of customers\u0092 belongings stranded across the globe, and First Point International, which claimed to procure visas for would-be emigrants to the US. Cargo Forwarding had once before gone into liquidation, losing some customers their possessions, and is presently launching a third incarnation, CFI Movers. First Point, whose activities left scores of customers out of pocket, is now reinvented as Visaplus and, according to trading standards, there are still no guarantees that customers will get the visa they are paying several thousand pounds for. </p> <p><strong>Most constructive excuse</strong></p> <p>Step forward those familiar faces at Time Computers who collected a reader\u0092s faulty computer then lost it. He discovered that its finance company could not cancel its credit agreement until it had heard from Time and Time refused to get in touch until it had examined the computer.

Connex explained that late-running services may make up for lost time (and therefore, presumably, save face in the company\u0092s performance record) by running non-stop to the terminus. Words of comfort at least from the rail passenger council, which promised we wouldn\u0092t be charged a penalty fee for overshooting our destination in such cases. Most blase opt-out Let\u0092s hear it for that toothy tiger Oftel, ever valiant in its regulation of telecoms companies. \"Licences are not dependent on standards of services because competition is the best regulator,\" it told us last June when asked about a poor-quality provider. \"It\u0092s not for us to try to run companies, although we might have an informal word with them.\" Tardiest service Achieved by an Essex firm, Bryco Glaze, which had still not fulfilled a double-glazing order 13 months later. When our reader tried to cancel, the company threatened to hold on to his deposit. Nor was it chastened when it replied (10 weeks later) to Consumer\u0092s overtures. The customer, it said, was being unreasonable in not giving it more time to chase vital parts. Most effective vanishing act Jointly won by the international removals company Cargo Forwarding, which disappeared leaving scores of customers\u0092 belongings stranded across the globe, and First Point International, which claimed to procure visas for would-be emigrants to the US. Cargo Forwarding had once before gone into liquidation, losing some customers their possessions, and is presently launching a third incarnation, CFI Movers. First Point, whose activities left scores of customers out of pocket, is now reinvented as Visaplus and, according to trading standards, there are still no guarantees that customers will get the visa they are paying several thousand pounds for. Most constructive excuse Step forward those familiar faces at Time Computers who collected a reader\u0092s faulty computer then lost it. He discovered that its finance company could not cancel its credit agreement until it had heard from Time and Time refused to get in touch until it had examined the computer. Which it had lost. \u0095 Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, phone us on 020-7713 4731, send a fax on 020-7239 9933 or email us at consumer@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>A top international motor sport event was cancelled yesterday due to fears over foot and mouth disease.</p> <p>The Isle of Man TT races, due to take place from May 26 to June 8, have in the past attracted up to 40,000 motorbike enthusiasts and are worth between \u00a35m and \u00a37m to the island's economy. But this is more than counterbalanced by the threat to that economy if there were an outbreak of foot and mouth.

      "bodyText": "A top international motor sport event was cancelled yesterday due to fears over foot and mouth disease. The Isle of Man TT races, due to take place from May 26 to June 8, have in the past attracted up to 40,000 motorbike enthusiasts and are worth between \u00a35m and \u00a37m to the island's economy. But this is more than counterbalanced by the threat to that economy if there were an outbreak of foot and mouth. All its 250,000 animals would have to be slaughtered, which would cost \u00a350m. Geoff le Page, director of tourism, said the decision to cancel had been a difficult one because tourism and agriculture were interlinked. A programme of extra precautions was put forward by the Department of Trade and Tourism, but the council of ministers decided that the races would constitute a significant risk to animal health and the agricultural industry. Although the island is still welcoming tourists, the TT races were a particular threat because of the number of spectators on farmland and lanes. \"The big debate has been to look at what precautions can be put in place,\" said Mr Le Page. \"Other avenues have been explored, such as putting grandstands up. But it is a 37.5 mile race and most of it is run on farmland.\" It was considered impractical to restrict spectator movements, and disinfecting the thousands of motorists who might have travelled from infected areas was too big a task. The Tynwald chief minister, Donald Gelling, said: \"We hope people will understand that the alternative was to take an extra risk, against advice, of introducing a terrible disease which could devastate the Manx countryside and cause long-term damage to tourism as well as to agriculture. \"Our priority must now be to help this important sector at this difficult time and to ask the fans to look forward to a special TT festival in 2002.\" The loss of business to the island will have to be addressed.

      "body": "<p>Is there no justice in politics? A new government moves in and recognises that as well as those in poverty - whose numbers had increased threefold under its predecessors - other people need help too. All families with children had lost out compared to childless couples. Similarly, pensioners just above the poverty line needed help as well as the 2m below. Under Labour's new strategy, 14% more families and 20% more pensioners will get it.</p> <p>The response last week when researchers in the Commons library tabulated these achievements must have been disheartening for ministers seeking to make welfare more popular.</p> <p>\"More families draw welfare\" (Telegraph). \"Means testing surge on cards\" (Express). \"The welfare explosion\" (Mail). Michael Portillo, who helped the Tory party push up means-tested benefits from 16% of all social security in 1979 to 34% in 1998, discovered a sudden antipathy to income-related benefits. He scornfully condemned the Labour strategy as \"welfare creep - a steady increase in the number of people caught in social security\".</p> <p>According to Labour, means-tested benefits as a proportion of social security spending have actually declined. But this is smoke and mirrors. It does not include Labour's tax credit schemes funded by the inland revenue rather than social security.</p> <p>It is tax credits which have meant that 38% of all households by 2003, compared with 24% in 1999, will be supported by income-related benefits. Support for pensioners will rise even more dramatically - from 37% to 57% in the same period. A person from Mars might have expected widespread approval of this move. But this ignores a deeply ingrained hostility to means tests in the UK.</p> <p>What Labour has done is strategically right. By targeting its resources it has been able to make dramatic improvements: 2m poor pensioners \u00a3800 a year better off; recently retired couples \u00a31,400 ahead; poor families \u00a33,000 better off. Spread to all, these benefits would shrink to a fraction.</p> <p>Where ministers have failed is in selling their reforms. This is partly because of their own negative messages. A prime minister who talks about \"ending the something for nothing society\" cannot expect to recapture welfare's popularity. Worse still, incremental reform has produced a highly complex system. Labour has moved social security towards an Australian model - with one major difference: special benefits for a middle band. In Australia, the poor and middle band enjoy the same generous benefits. They are affordable because they are withdrawn from the better-off. That is the right end of the income scale to apply means tests.</p>",

All families with children had lost out compared to childless couples. Similarly, pensioners just above the poverty line needed help as well as the 2m below. Under Labour's new strategy, 14% more families and 20% more pensioners will get it. The response last week when researchers in the Commons library tabulated these achievements must have been disheartening for ministers seeking to make welfare more popular. \"More families draw welfare\" (Telegraph). \"Means testing surge on cards\" (Express). \"The welfare explosion\" (Mail). Michael Portillo, who helped the Tory party push up means-tested benefits from 16% of all social security in 1979 to 34% in 1998, discovered a sudden antipathy to income-related benefits. He scornfully condemned the Labour strategy as \"welfare creep - a steady increase in the number of people caught in social security\". According to Labour, means-tested benefits as a proportion of social security spending have actually declined. But this is smoke and mirrors. It does not include Labour's tax credit schemes funded by the inland revenue rather than social security. It is tax credits which have meant that 38% of all households by 2003, compared with 24% in 1999, will be supported by income-related benefits. Support for pensioners will rise even more dramatically - from 37% to 57% in the same period. A person from Mars might have expected widespread approval of this move. But this ignores a deeply ingrained hostility to means tests in the UK. What Labour has done is strategically right. By targeting its resources it has been able to make dramatic improvements: 2m poor pensioners \u00a3800 a year better off; recently retired couples \u00a31,400 ahead; poor families \u00a33,000 better off. Spread to all, these benefits would shrink to a fraction. Where ministers have failed is in selling their reforms. This is partly because of their own negative messages. A prime minister who talks about \"ending the something for nothing society\" cannot expect to recapture welfare's popularity. Worse still, incremental reform has produced a highly complex system. Labour has moved social security towards an Australian model - with one major difference: special benefits for a middle band. In Australia, the poor and middle band enjoy the same generous benefits. They are affordable because they are withdrawn from the better-off. That is the right end of the income scale to apply means tests.",

A web campaign launched in New Zealand has been urging the agnostic to put \"Jedi\" in the space reserved for other religions. If more than 10,000 people do so, runs the rumour, the 2011 census will have to include Jedi as an official religion alongside Buddhism and Christianity. Unfortunately for Star Wars buffs, Cook says this will not be the case. \"These sort of dilemmas arise all the time when you're asking people about their lives.

      "bodyText": "An Austrian appeal court ruled at the end of last week that the far right politician J\u00f6rg Haider had made comments which trivialised the crimes of the Third Reich. The judgment was a victory for political scientist Anton Pelinka of Innsbruck university. In a television interview Prof Pelinka had referred to a statement by Haider that concentration camps were \"punishment centres\", saying that Haider had played down the horrors of Nazi rule. Haider's lawyer and now the country's controversial justice minister, Dieter Bohmd\u00f6rfer brought the case against Prof Pelinka, one of hundreds that the litigious populist has launched against his opponents. In an initial hearing the court had ruled in favour of the far right leader, awarding him \u00a33,000. Prof Pelinka has already lost one similar case against the politician. The cases have highlighted fears that the entry of Haider's Freedom party (FPO) in a coalition government with the conservatives has severely damaged freedom of speech in Austria and has also served to make the FPO's anti-foreigner rhetoric part of mainstream discourse. In the remarks that landed him in front of the court, Prof Pelinka said: \"In his career Haider has repeatedly made statements which amount to trivialising National Socialism. \"On the whole, Haider is responsible for making certain National Socialist positions and certain National Socialist remarks more politically acceptable.\" \"Salonf\u00e4hig\" is the precise German phrase - comments that become more and more acceptable to utter in Viennese salons without eyebrows being raised. Haider gained international notoriety for enthusing about Hitler's unemployment policies and praising SS veterans as \"men of character\". He has turned into a figure of fascination for linguists over the years, who have remarked that he has become increasingly proficient at using the methods of distortion, exaggeration, diversion, simplification, mitigation, and more than any other Austrian politician, humour, to play his populist game. \"Haider is someone who plays the populist game combined with a very clever rhetoric to which one cannot react with objective facts,\" according to Ruth Wodak, professor of applied linguistics at Vienna university. A linguistic study she led some months ago concluded that Austria was the only country in which the far right was not only included in mainstream debate, but where it actually led the agenda. Following last week's verdict, Haider, who resigned as the FPO's leader almost a year ago, but who remains its de facto leader, said losing the case to Prof Pelinka was part of the \"professional suffering\" he had learned to endure. \"Since my capacity to suffer is unlimited and has grown with the years I will cope with that,\" he said. But he may take comfort in the fact that Austria's most popular newspaper and a strong FPO supporter, very effectively employs the Haider rhetoric. The Kronen Zeitung which is the most successful newspaper in the world in relation to per capita sales, is loaded with the subliminal meanings that have become Haider's trademark. Wolf Martin, who modified his birth name - Wolfgang Martinek - because it sounded too foreign, writes a daily poem for the tabloid in which he effectively uses innuendo to convey a heavily loaded and often far right message. In November 1999 the man dubbed Haider's \"poet laureate\" attacked \"anti-fascists\" after some photographs at an historic exhibition on the Wehrmacht were discovered to be fakes. The last word of the poem, \"ausgeschwitzt\", from the verb \"ausschwitzen\", meaning to sweat out, is a word play on Auschwitz concentration camp. The message in the final line was that the brains of Austrian school children will eventually \"sweat out\" the lies that have been planted there by their anti-fascist teachers about the Nazi era. Last Friday he was said to have surpassed himself with a birthday poem in honour of Adolf Hitler who would have been 112 years old. \"Indeed, today is a great day!/ I've long been looking forward to/ everyone is celebrating today/ although most are having to celebrate in the privacy of their homes... we should honour him, and 'heil' him... \" At the end he employs a twist as the poem turns into a tribute to the second series of the TV show Taxi Orange, the Austrian version of Big Brother which started on the same day. Seven years ago he wrote a similar tribute to Hitler - at the end suggesting it was in praise of another Adolf - Adolf Scharf, one of Austria's first postwar presidents - who has the same birthday. \"Who is interested in [the poem]?\" asked popular commentator with Der Standard, Hans Rauscher. \"Well, perhaps those who closely know Wolfgang Martinek's opinions and above all know that April 20 is the F\u00fchrer's birthday... he also liked calling himself Wolf.\" Austrian publisher Richard Brem says that the influence of Martin and Haider on the popular psyche of contemporary Austria cannot be underestimated. \"More than any other people in Austria, Martin and Haider are shaping and influencing society in a very profound way, using coded language, similar terminology and in a teasing way.\" \"The whole shift to the right is down to them.\" The recently deceased Austrian poet, HC Artmann, commented that Haider is the only national politician who takes an artistic or playful approach to language. The Haider-Martin style has quickly caught on. Just as readers of the Kronen Zeitung have begun writing letters to the newspaper in \"Wolf Martin rhyming style\", so too has Haider picked up his quill. He recently read one of his own Martin-style poems - an attack on Germany's Green foreign minister Joschka Fischer - at an FPO beer hall rally, to resounding laughter and applause.

Valerie Martin, partner at PKF accountants, which has 1,200 GP practices on its books, said private practice would be \"very risky\" for most doctors. \"Most doctors would have to relocate to affluent areas in London or the south-east because their patients could not - or would not - pay,\" she said. \"A lot of the business costs that GPs with NHS contracts have are covered by reimbursements - they get back 70% of their staff costs. So you'd need a good list size of affluent patients to cover your overheads.\" Going private would also leave doctors' vulnerable to economic downturns, said Ms Martin. \"The last recession had a direct impact on our private GPs' profits, leaving them unable to offer new services or attract more patients.\" London GP Dr Jules Eden, who runs e-med private medical services, said the set up costs for private practice were considerable. \"It's \u00a320,000 a year to rent a room in lower Sloane Street, plus \u00a315,000 for a secretary and at least \u00a35,000 on marketing costs. If you've had to relocate, you can expect to take five to seven years to build up your patient list.\" Despite its tough rhetoric, the BMA now says GPs would not necessarily go private if their threat to resign came to fruition. Chairman of the BMA's GPs' committee, Dr John Chisholm, admitted most GPs worked in areas where private practice was not viable. But they could become non-principals, work under personal medical service contracts, accept an emergency contract from the government or leave medicine altogether. \"I don't think there would be a huge reduction of GP services available to the public,\" he said. \"However, I would expect variations in provision to increase with fewer practices in deprived inner city areas.\" However, Ms Martin said private practice would be the only option for GPs if they wanted to avoid working to government targets and reduce their NHS bureaucracy. \"I don't think this threat has been thought through.\"",

      "bodyText": "Omnicom Group has reported a rise in first quarter earnings, despite a weakening of the US advertising market. The advertising agency network's net income for the first quarter of 2001 grew by 20% year on year to \u00a366m. Omnicom's worldwide revenue rose 16% year on year to \u00a31.1bn with international revenue for the first quarter of \u00a3489m, representing a 6% increase. Revenue in the US, where the burst of the dot.com bubble has caused a worrying contraction in overall advertising spend, still rose by 25% to \u00a3623m. This growth was largely attributed to a raft of new business wins, including Kentucky Friend Chicken. John Wren, the chief executive of Omnicom Group, said new business was beginning to pick up in the second quarter. \"The business environment in the first quarter was challenging... but we feel that all of our business units performed well in the quarter,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "Scotland Yard detectives are investigating possible criminal charges against the foreign minister of Iraq, Tariq Aziz. An indictment could severely restrict the movement of Mr Aziz because he would be open to extradition from a range of countries he visits, including France. A long-time confidant of Iraq's leader, Saddam Hussein, he travels freely around world capitals, often to lobby against the UN sanctions imposed on Iraq after it tried to annex Kuwait in 1990. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police confirmed yesterday that the case had been referred to the force last month by the attorney-general, Lord Williams of Mostyn. The anti-terrorist squad is carrying out the investigation. The Labour MP George Galloway, a campaigner against the UN sanctions, described the move as \"disturbing\". But, he said, Tariq Aziz \"is not worried. Were he to be held somewhere, he would turn that period of detention into a platform for the tragedy of Iraq.\" Rupert Cazalet, a spokesman for Lord Williams, said yesterday: \"We feel there is a possibility [of an indictment] and if there is, it should be properly investigated.\" The police are studying documents compiled by Indict, a British-based organisation funded by the US Congress to investigate Iraqi war crimes. Indict is seeking criminal charges against Saddam Hussein and Mr Aziz under the Taking of Hostages Act (1982), alleging that many of hostages taken at the start of the Gulf war in 1990 were subjected to mental abuse and torture. In a statement, Lord Williams effectively ruled out charges against President Saddam: as head of state he could claim immunity, and the attorney general was not satisfied that the evidence was \"sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction\". But the statement said: \"Whether the court would uphold any claim of immunity that may be asserted by Tariq Aziz is less clear.\" Lord Williams was not satisfied that the evidence offered a realistic prospect of conviction in his case either, but said \"there is scope for further inquiries to be carried out\". Mudhafar Amin, head of the Iraqi interests section in London, said: \"It is just a political manoeuvre as part of the campaign to keep up the sanctions against Iraq.\"",

The Advertising Standards Authority said Virgin was wrong to promise customers in its New Year advertising campaign, that things were getting back to normal following last year's Hatfield disaster. Virgin told passengers that from January 29 they could expect an average journey time of one hour 55 minutes between Birmingham New Street and London Euston stations. It also promised the \"improved service that you can rely on\" would run every 30 minutes during peak times. But the advertising watchdog upheld complaints from five customers who claimed Virgin had not delivered its promises. It is the third complaint the authority has upheld against Virgin Trains's claims on running times and cheap tickets since last July. Virgin said the blame for the latest ruling lay with Railtrack as the \"custodian of the nation's railway\" responsible for getting trains running on time. Virgin spokesman Dennis Lovett said: \"We have to book advertising in advance and we were relying on the best information available (from Railtrack) at the time.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong>Trustee Act 2000</strong></p> <p>This came into force on February 1. The act makes considerable changes to the power of trustees.</p> <p>The new act, which applies to charitable trusts but not to charitable companies, extends the powers of trustees of charitable trusts in the following areas:-</p> <p><strong>Investment</strong>: Trustees can now invest in most types of property, provided they have regard to their overriding duty of prudence. This requires them to review the investments from time to time against defined standard investment criteria (which deal with the suitability of the investments and the need for diversification) and to take appropriate investment advice in most circumstances</p> <p><strong>Delegation</strong>: Trustees of charitable trusts can now appoint investment managers and other agents, including nominees and custodians, without an express power in the trust deed. Investment managers must be appointed in writing, and must have a policy statement from the trustees about how they should act. Restrictions are imposed on the terms of their appointment.</p> <p><strong>Insurance</strong>: Trustees' powers to insure trust property are extended.</p> <p> <strong>Freedom of Information Act</strong></p> <p>This received royal assent on November 30. The act provides a right to information held by public authorities. Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled: </p> <p>A) To be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds the information of the description specified in the request, and; </p> <p>B) If that is the case, to have that information communicated to him.</p> <p>The \"public authorities\" to which the act applies include central and local government, parliament, the armed forces, the national health service, certain schools, colleges, universities and other educational institutions and the police.</p> <p>A small number of charities, such as the British Council and the Tate are public authorities under the act.</p> <p><strong>Protection of Children Act</strong></p> <p>This act places the Department of Health list of persons considered unsuitable to work with children on a statutory basis. This new list will be called the protection of children list. Eventually this list will be accessed via the criminal records bureau and this will act as a one-stop shop for organisations which need to check the backgrounds of individuals.</p> <p><strong>Regulation of care services in England and Wales</strong></p> <p>A new system of regulation for care homes will be introduced by the Care Standards Act 2000, which will come into force in spring 2002. There will be some important differences from the present regime.</p> <p>The new act will apply to children's homes, independent hospitals, independent clinics, care homes, residential family centres, independent medical agencies, domiciliary care agencies, nurses agencies, fostering agencies and voluntary adoption agencies. In addition, local authorities will be required for the first time to meet the same standards as independent sector providers.</p> <p>There will be one registration authority in England, the national care standards commission, with eight regional offices and one in Wales.</p> <p>There will be national minimum standards for each of the services to be regulated and establishments and agencies will be inspected by reference to these standards.</p> <p>A timetable has been published on the Department of Health website.</p> <p>Charities which are not currently registered but which will need to when the new act comes into force should contact their local authority/health authority nearer the time for information on how to apply.</p> <p><strong>Data protection</strong></p> <p>Under a recent exemption published by the data protection registrar, a not-for-profit organisation is specifically exempted from the notification provisions under the Data Protection Act 1998 if it is processing is only:</p> <p>\u0095 For the purpose of establishing or maintaining membership or support for a body which is not conducted for profit;</p> <p>\u0095 If the processing is to provide and administer activities for individuals who are either members of the body or have regular contact with it;</p> <p>\u0095 For those whose data is being processed (data subjects) and the types of personal data which are to be processed (data classes).</p> <p>The organisation is subject to restrictions in relation to the disclosure of the data to third parties and the retention.</p> <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p> <p>For charities that engage in trading, the Inland Revenue has clarified its de minimus concession. This applies where trades, which amount in part but not wholly to a primary purpose trade, eg a museum shop which sells goods relating to a primary purpose (eg educational) and some of which do not (eg mugs, tea towels).</p> <p>The revenue will accept that all of the profits of trade will be exempt from tax if:</p> <p>\u0095 The turnover of the part of the trade which is not within a primary purpose is not large ie not more than \u00a350,000; and<br>\u0095 The turnover of that part of the trade is less than 10% of the turnover of the whole trade.</p> <p>Charities will also be exempt from tax on profits from small trading, which does not have to be ancillary if:</p> <p>\u0095 The total turnover from all of the activities does not exceed the annual turnover limit or \u00b7 If the total turnover exceeds the annual turnover limit the charity had a reasonable expectation that it would not do so;<br>\u0095 The profits are used solely for the purposes of the charity</p> <p>The annual turnover limit is \u00a35,000 or if the turnover is greater than \u00a350,000, 25% of the charity's gross income but no more than \u00a350,000.</p> <p>For the purpose of this limit gross income means the total receipts of the charity for the year from all sources (grants, donations, investment, income etc).</p> <p><strong>Business sponsorship</strong></p> <p>New guidelines issued by the Inland Revenue clarify:</p> <p>If a charity publicises a link with a sponsor this may be regarded as a trade.

The Inland Revenue will regard a reference to a sponsor as an advertisement if it incorporates any of the following:</p> <p>\u0095 Large and prominent displays of the sponsor's logo;<br>\u0095 Large and prominent displays of the sponsor's corporate colours;<br>7#149; A description of the sponsor's products or services.</p> <p><strong>Registered trade marks</strong></p> <p>Two recent developments of interest to charities are: </p> <p>1.

Investment managers must be appointed in writing, and must have a policy statement from the trustees about how they should act. Restrictions are imposed on the terms of their appointment. Insurance: Trustees' powers to insure trust property are extended. Freedom of Information Act This received royal assent on November 30. The act provides a right to information held by public authorities. Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled: A) To be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds the information of the description specified in the request, and; B) If that is the case, to have that information communicated to him. The \"public authorities\" to which the act applies include central and local government, parliament, the armed forces, the national health service, certain schools, colleges, universities and other educational institutions and the police. A small number of charities, such as the British Council and the Tate are public authorities under the act. Protection of Children Act This act places the Department of Health list of persons considered unsuitable to work with children on a statutory basis. This new list will be called the protection of children list. Eventually this list will be accessed via the criminal records bureau and this will act as a one-stop shop for organisations which need to check the backgrounds of individuals. Regulation of care services in England and Wales A new system of regulation for care homes will be introduced by the Care Standards Act 2000, which will come into force in spring 2002. There will be some important differences from the present regime. The new act will apply to children's homes, independent hospitals, independent clinics, care homes, residential family centres, independent medical agencies, domiciliary care agencies, nurses agencies, fostering agencies and voluntary adoption agencies. In addition, local authorities will be required for the first time to meet the same standards as independent sector providers. There will be one registration authority in England, the national care standards commission, with eight regional offices and one in Wales. There will be national minimum standards for each of the services to be regulated and establishments and agencies will be inspected by reference to these standards. A timetable has been published on the Department of Health website. Charities which are not currently registered but which will need to when the new act comes into force should contact their local authority/health authority nearer the time for information on how to apply. Data protection Under a recent exemption published by the data protection registrar, a not-for-profit organisation is specifically exempted from the notification provisions under the Data Protection Act 1998 if it is processing is only: \u0095 For the purpose of establishing or maintaining membership or support for a body which is not conducted for profit; \u0095 If the processing is to provide and administer activities for individuals who are either members of the body or have regular contact with it; \u0095 For those whose data is being processed (data subjects) and the types of personal data which are to be processed (data classes). The organisation is subject to restrictions in relation to the disclosure of the data to third parties and the retention. Taxation For charities that engage in trading, the Inland Revenue has clarified its de minimus concession. This applies where trades, which amount in part but not wholly to a primary purpose trade, eg a museum shop which sells goods relating to a primary purpose (eg educational) and some of which do not (eg mugs, tea towels). The revenue will accept that all of the profits of trade will be exempt from tax if: \u0095 The turnover of the part of the trade which is not within a primary purpose is not large ie not more than \u00a350,000; and \u0095 The turnover of that part of the trade is less than 10% of the turnover of the whole trade. Charities will also be exempt from tax on profits from small trading, which does not have to be ancillary if: \u0095 The total turnover from all of the activities does not exceed the annual turnover limit or \u00b7 If the total turnover exceeds the annual turnover limit the charity had a reasonable expectation that it would not do so; \u0095 The profits are used solely for the purposes of the charity The annual turnover limit is \u00a35,000 or if the turnover is greater than \u00a350,000, 25% of the charity's gross income but no more than \u00a350,000. For the purpose of this limit gross income means the total receipts of the charity for the year from all sources (grants, donations, investment, income etc). Business sponsorship New guidelines issued by the Inland Revenue clarify: If a charity publicises a link with a sponsor this may be regarded as a trade. Test: If the publicity amounts to no more than an acknowledgement of the sponsorship in the charity's publications, posters etc then this will not be regarded as a trade. However, if the reference to a sponsor in the publicity materials amounts to advertisements for the business then the payments will be treated as trading income. The Inland Revenue will regard a reference to a sponsor as an advertisement if it incorporates any of the following: \u0095 Large and prominent displays of the sponsor's logo; \u0095 Large and prominent displays of the sponsor's corporate colours; 7#149; A description of the sponsor's products or services. Registered trade marks Two recent developments of interest to charities are: 1. The UK trade mark registry has changed its policy and will now, in some cases, allow registrations for \"retail services\" and \"mail order services\". Therefore any charities with shops or catalogues should consider registering their mark in this category; 2. The registry has issued guidance about its policy on registering marks ending in \".com\" or \".co.uk\" or preceded by \"e-\" or \"m-\". As a general rule, the registry will disregard these prefixes and will consider whether the rest of the mark is distinctive. Use of photographs Charities should review whether their system of storing photographs means that the photographs qualify as \"data\" protected under the Data Protection Act 1998; ie can an individual be identified by that data? They should also review procedures for obtaining consent from individuals to use photographs of them. The consumer protection (distance selling) regulations 2000 These seek to protect consumers who buy goods without being able to see them. This will apply to charities selling products via the internet, by mail order or by telephone. \u0095 The consumer must be provided with certain information in good time before the conclusion of the contract - eg name and address of supplier, main characteristics of the goods and services, arrangements for payments, price and the consumer's rights to withdraw from the contract \u0095 That the consumer is notified of his/her right to withdraw from the contract within 7 working days after receipt of goods or the conclusion of the contract (in the case of services) without penalty. \u0095 That the supplier is required to execute the contract within 30 days. If the supplier fails to do so, then the consumer has a right to a refund with 30 days. Sale of second hand goods Any charities involved in the sale of second hand goods should be aware of a potential change in the law due to come into effect on January 1 2002. The government plans to implement an EU directive on the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees. Companies - electronic communications with shareholders - electronic communications order 2000 Charities that are companies limited by guarantee can now distribute annual reports, accounts and other information on the website or through other electronic communication and allow members to use e-communications to appoint proxies and give them voting instructions.",

By the time he took early retirement last year tenants were leaving in droves.</p> <p>\"When I first took the job in 1984 a set of keys for one of our properties were really prized. Now, to many, it is just another property,\" he said.</p> <p>A major problem is that in many parts of the region, particularly in Cumbrian coastal towns, it is as cheap to buy a home as to rent one from a housing association. </p> <p>During Mr Cook's tenure the combination of an increase in new cheap housing in the area, a competitive mortgage market and low interest rates made house buying an attractive financial option.</p> <p>During the same period, renting social housing had become increasingly stigmatised. Those who could afford to move out of social housing did so, leaving only those out of work and on benefit in social housing. </p> <p>\"If the opportunity presents itself people will leave a home that they feel is not giving best value.

      "bodyText": "When Nigel Cook first became director of Home housing association's north-west region, the homes he managed were in big demand. By the time he took early retirement last year tenants were leaving in droves. \"When I first took the job in 1984 a set of keys for one of our properties were really prized. Now, to many, it is just another property,\" he said. A major problem is that in many parts of the region, particularly in Cumbrian coastal towns, it is as cheap to buy a home as to rent one from a housing association. During Mr Cook's tenure the combination of an increase in new cheap housing in the area, a competitive mortgage market and low interest rates made house buying an attractive financial option. During the same period, renting social housing had become increasingly stigmatised. Those who could afford to move out of social housing did so, leaving only those out of work and on benefit in social housing. \"If the opportunity presents itself people will leave a home that they feel is not giving best value. They want to live in other areas because the neighbours are seen as 'nicer people',\" Mr Cook said. He added: \"The average rent on our new build properties was about \u00a360 a week, we just couldn't compete with the cost of owner occupation. Waiting lists for housing association properties were absolutely zilch, there's no demand.\" It is not only Home housing association that has suffered problems in the area. In 1999, Allerdale council transferred its homes to Derwent and Solway - a new housing association. Since then the association has been struggling to meet its business plan because it underestimated the number of homes that would be empty and therefore not generating income. The association has now taken the unprecedented step of trying to encourage right to buy sales. Usually, right to buy sales are considered a financial problem for stock transfer housing associations because landlords are not compensated for the huge discounts available. But if the homes would otherwise be empty, housing associations will take any money they can get. However, Derwent and Solway acting director David Cumberland points out that the policy also helps stabilise communities. \"We want to see a steady flow of purchases,\" said Mr Cumberland. \"It will mean that people will stay on the estates rather than move out of the area. We want to see a diversification of ownership. There is not the need for the same proportion of social housing as there has been in the past.\" The turnover rate of housing is seen by housing management as a key indication of the popularity of homes. High turnover is also a key sign of an instability in communities. In the mid 1980s, turnover was 3%. Now it is nearer to 15% in many of the Cumbrian coastal towns. Graham Howarth, chief executive of Workington based Westfield housing association, said: \"We set a target of 10% turnover, but it's bloody hard to keep to that.\" His organisation is trying to reduce the stigma of renting from a housing association.

In a package which mixed the carrot of extra funds and powers with the stick of \"community payback\" orders imposed on young offenders - as well as clothes, computer, travel or music vouchers for those who stay out of trouble - Mr Blair went beyond last year's attacks on \"yob culture\". In the potentially most significant part of yesterday's initiative, the prime minister said that Labour, if re-elected, would legislate to create business improvement districts on the American model, which encourages local authorities to draw up contracts with local business to provide additional services and improvements in return for an extra business rate. It would help to reverse the downward spiral that often occurs when a district slides downhill and then sees business abandon it, taking jobs, services and hope away just when it is most needed he told his audience.

      "body": "<p>Politicians, like vicars, are inherently funny. What politicians do to get elected, what they duck to avoid trouble is often absurd. They have to say things they do not think and do things they hate. They must curry favour with obnoxious people and button their lip when any sane person would utter a rude riposte. In power they must pretend everything under their aegis is for the best in the best of all possible worlds. In opposition they make themselves equally ridiculous alleging that the nation is always on its knees.</p> <p>What they say in public may bear slender relation to what they think in private - and yet breaking the omerta code is out of the question (on the record). Those who appear human - the Mo Mowlams, Ken Livingstones and Kenneth Clarkes - are mainly just more charming actors with a better knack for apparent sincerity. This does not make politicians villains, just professionals in a very tough trade.</p> <p>But there is no riper material for satirists than the comedy of manners at Westminster. Only turn to Simon Hoggart for each day's delightful ongoing pantomime. Indeed only turn to Number 10's website for some sublime bons mots. Try \"The prime minister's Passover message: Wishing you a happy and kosher Passover\", signed with a personal flourish. Or maybe a soup\u00e7on of the PM's Diwali speech, (surprisingly not airbrushed): \"Diwali aur naye saal mubarak - best wishes for a happy Diwali and New Year ... I was very struck, listening just now to Mr Hinduja talking to us, about how these values of common understanding and harmony and peace and working together stretch too across national boundaries...\" And so on.</p> <p>A political comedy, Feelgood by Alistair Beaton, which just opened in the West End, is set inside New Labour's inner sanctum in a hotel room at party conference time. It has the sort of irresistible and inventive funniness that would make even its chief victims, Alastair Campbell or Tony Blair, emit a belly laugh or two. Although peppered with political barbs - the leader \"does not break promises, he just erodes them\" - the fun resides in a brilliantly made old-fashioned farce where doors bang, people hide in lavatories and everything that can go wrong, does. It is Feydeau set not in the boudoir of a lady of ill repute, but in the conference suite of a party of ill repute, (as all parties always are).</p> <p>Besides, it is a truth universally acknowledged that any party leading 14 % in the polls and destined for a second resounding victory must be in want of a good kicking. For lack of any effective opposition, who else is to check arrogance and hubris but the professional jesters and ego-deflators? The latest run of Bremner, Bird and Fortune has just come to an end on Channel 4: satire is always cleared off the airwaves well before an election. The two Johns' well-researched dialogues were often devastating in their demolition of fraudulent political reason ing. Bremner is a genius mimic, with some good conceits, such as the CCTV scenes between Blair and Campbell in their office. His Blair has become the Blair of national imagination.</p> <p>To add to that sense that art and life are sometimes politically inextricable, yesterday the real PM made a big electioneering speech on yob culture that so closely mirrored the final, very funny prime ministerial speech in Feelgood, that the author can hardly have believed his ears. His leader (referred to by his team as DL for Divine Light or Dreadfully Lightweight), ends the play with a conference speech every word of which could come (or maybe did come?) from a real speech, including the rallying cry \"The job culture, not the yob culture!\" which surely Number 10 would have used yesterday if they'd thought of it. Well, Alistair Beaton is an former speech writer for Gordon Brown, so he knows how the dreadful rhythms of those toe-curling conference set-pieces do more to set the teeth on edge than rouse the rabble.</p> <p>But cynicism, says the government gravely, is a dangerous modern disease. The press spews it out daily - after all, 70% of newspapers are not so much cynics as sworn enemies. We in the left of centre press are \"critical friends\", a tricky concept. (After all, friends are for support not criticism.) New Labour smiles wanly at the hailstorm of ever more savage jokes raining down upon them - and they wonder, as all politicians do, why no one loves them. This cynicism is corrosive, they fear. It suggests \"They're all the same\", and \"Nothing works\", plus \u00e7a change, why bother?</p> <p>In truth, the perpetual harping on about the government as if it were uniquely venal and immoral began to pall a bit by the end of the Bremner run. The programme's grapeshot often went wide, Bremner's skilful impressions masking some pretty thought-free scripts. The perpetual this-government-stinks mode began to whine monotonously. After all, if everything New Labour does is self-serving balderdash designed to hold on to their red boxes and Rovers, then there is no particular pith or punch in attacks on the things they deserve a drubbing for. And why the narrow range?</p> <p>Mark Thomas has delivered very funny body blows against far harder and more interesting targets - Export Credit Guarantees, inheritance tax avoiders, fat cats of all kinds stunned to be challenged in the flesh. There is an intellectual idleness about just popping away at politicians for being opportunistically two-faced, (or three-faced if you count the third way). It is in their job-description to try too hard to please while fail ing to live up to their own high rhetoric. There is not much sleaze in this government, but there is always comic potential in a dissonance between politicians' public and private personae. It is also the fate of progressive governments to disappoint. They never reach Jerusalem, not next year, not ever, but at least it is on the itinerary, while the right only yearns for yesterday.</p> <p>The government may feel aggrieved about unwarranted popular cynicism, but the question is whether Labour really takes the problem seriously enough. They should peruse the Bremner tapes, go to see Feelgood, inhale the aroma of disappointment and worry harder about very large numbers who may not vote this time. (Why give a huge win to a party bound to win anyway?) It is these voters Tony Blair needs to convince, but attacks on yob culture look cynical. Pushing ahead with the universally condemned tube public-private partnership is incomprehensible: a paean of praise for developing a stronger, better public sector would clear the air. Come clean and start to boast about the redistribution done so far, with a promise of more to come. Voter cynicism is fuelled not only by the nihilism of the press and entertainers having fun - but also by Labour pig-headedness on some totemic issues. Too many people may vote for nothing unless they get something stirring to vote for. Meanwhile, good jokes cost votes.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

They have to say things they do not think and do things they hate. They must curry favour with obnoxious people and button their lip when any sane person would utter a rude riposte. In power they must pretend everything under their aegis is for the best in the best of all possible worlds. In opposition they make themselves equally ridiculous alleging that the nation is always on its knees. What they say in public may bear slender relation to what they think in private - and yet breaking the omerta code is out of the question (on the record). Those who appear human - the Mo Mowlams, Ken Livingstones and Kenneth Clarkes - are mainly just more charming actors with a better knack for apparent sincerity. This does not make politicians villains, just professionals in a very tough trade. But there is no riper material for satirists than the comedy of manners at Westminster. Only turn to Simon Hoggart for each day's delightful ongoing pantomime. Indeed only turn to Number 10's website for some sublime bons mots. Try \"The prime minister's Passover message: Wishing you a happy and kosher Passover\", signed with a personal flourish. Or maybe a soup\u00e7on of the PM's Diwali speech, (surprisingly not airbrushed): \"Diwali aur naye saal mubarak - best wishes for a happy Diwali and New Year ... I was very struck, listening just now to Mr Hinduja talking to us, about how these values of common understanding and harmony and peace and working together stretch too across national boundaries...\" And so on. A political comedy, Feelgood by Alistair Beaton, which just opened in the West End, is set inside New Labour's inner sanctum in a hotel room at party conference time. It has the sort of irresistible and inventive funniness that would make even its chief victims, Alastair Campbell or Tony Blair, emit a belly laugh or two. Although peppered with political barbs - the leader \"does not break promises, he just erodes them\" - the fun resides in a brilliantly made old-fashioned farce where doors bang, people hide in lavatories and everything that can go wrong, does. It is Feydeau set not in the boudoir of a lady of ill repute, but in the conference suite of a party of ill repute, (as all parties always are). Besides, it is a truth universally acknowledged that any party leading 14 % in the polls and destined for a second resounding victory must be in want of a good kicking. For lack of any effective opposition, who else is to check arrogance and hubris but the professional jesters and ego-deflators? The latest run of Bremner, Bird and Fortune has just come to an end on Channel 4: satire is always cleared off the airwaves well before an election. The two Johns' well-researched dialogues were often devastating in their demolition of fraudulent political reason ing. Bremner is a genius mimic, with some good conceits, such as the CCTV scenes between Blair and Campbell in their office. His Blair has become the Blair of national imagination. To add to that sense that art and life are sometimes politically inextricable, yesterday the real PM made a big electioneering speech on yob culture that so closely mirrored the final, very funny prime ministerial speech in Feelgood, that the author can hardly have believed his ears. His leader (referred to by his team as DL for Divine Light or Dreadfully Lightweight), ends the play with a conference speech every word of which could come (or maybe did come?) from a real speech, including the rallying cry \"The job culture, not the yob culture!\" which surely Number 10 would have used yesterday if they'd thought of it. Well, Alistair Beaton is an former speech writer for Gordon Brown, so he knows how the dreadful rhythms of those toe-curling conference set-pieces do more to set the teeth on edge than rouse the rabble. But cynicism, says the government gravely, is a dangerous modern disease. The press spews it out daily - after all, 70% of newspapers are not so much cynics as sworn enemies. We in the left of centre press are \"critical friends\", a tricky concept. (After all, friends are for support not criticism.) New Labour smiles wanly at the hailstorm of ever more savage jokes raining down upon them - and they wonder, as all politicians do, why no one loves them. This cynicism is corrosive, they fear. It suggests \"They're all the same\", and \"Nothing works\", plus \u00e7a change, why bother? In truth, the perpetual harping on about the government as if it were uniquely venal and immoral began to pall a bit by the end of the Bremner run. The programme's grapeshot often went wide, Bremner's skilful impressions masking some pretty thought-free scripts. The perpetual this-government-stinks mode began to whine monotonously. After all, if everything New Labour does is self-serving balderdash designed to hold on to their red boxes and Rovers, then there is no particular pith or punch in attacks on the things they deserve a drubbing for. And why the narrow range? Mark Thomas has delivered very funny body blows against far harder and more interesting targets - Export Credit Guarantees, inheritance tax avoiders, fat cats of all kinds stunned to be challenged in the flesh. There is an intellectual idleness about just popping away at politicians for being opportunistically two-faced, (or three-faced if you count the third way). It is in their job-description to try too hard to please while fail ing to live up to their own high rhetoric. There is not much sleaze in this government, but there is always comic potential in a dissonance between politicians' public and private personae. It is also the fate of progressive governments to disappoint. They never reach Jerusalem, not next year, not ever, but at least it is on the itinerary, while the right only yearns for yesterday. The government may feel aggrieved about unwarranted popular cynicism, but the question is whether Labour really takes the problem seriously enough. They should peruse the Bremner tapes, go to see Feelgood, inhale the aroma of disappointment and worry harder about very large numbers who may not vote this time. (Why give a huge win to a party bound to win anyway?) It is these voters Tony Blair needs to convince, but attacks on yob culture look cynical. Pushing ahead with the universally condemned tube public-private partnership is incomprehensible: a paean of praise for developing a stronger, better public sector would clear the air. Come clean and start to boast about the redistribution done so far, with a promise of more to come. Voter cynicism is fuelled not only by the nihilism of the press and entertainers having fun - but also by Labour pig-headedness on some totemic issues. Too many people may vote for nothing unless they get something stirring to vote for. Meanwhile, good jokes cost votes. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>When a tuberculosis notification lands on the desk of Surinder Bakhshi, the first thing the doctor wants to know is the patient's race. </p> <p>\"When I get a lab report through on a TB case, I first check which ethnic community it has occurred in. If it is in a community where I would not expect it, that worries me,\" says Bakhshi, a consultant in communicable disease control. </p> <p>For while TB can infect any race, it is one of several illnesses, including coronary heart disease and sickle cell anaemia, that show dramatic variations in incidence depending on ethnic group. </p> <p>In Birmingham in 1999 people of Afro-Caribbean origin were five times more likely to suffer from TB than the indigenous white population. The rate was 20 times greater among people of Indian descent and 26 times higher among people of Pakistani origin. </p> <p>Leicester - one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the UK - had a TB rate that was four times the national average even before the current outbreak at Crown Hills Community College; last week numbers linked to this outbreak climbed to 50. The rate of coronary heart disease in Bradford among people of Bangladeshi origin is 30% above the national average for women, and 75% higher for men. </p> <p>Discussion about the reasons for these variations can be difficult. It seems that just as party leaders Tony Blair, William Hague and Charles Kennedy have agreed not to play the \"race card\" in the coming general election, so some healthcare professionals are cautious of spelling out how someone's ethnicity can affect personal health. </p> <p>Yet healthcare planners do take these factors into account in devising services. Earlier this year Leicester Royal Infirmary announced that it would build a \u00a31.8m infectious diseases wing. It will take cases of TB, drug-resistant diseases and tropical fevers such as malaria. </p> <p>Malaria is not contagious but it can be confused with fevers that are, and it is being seen more frequently in Leicester's health centres. The reason is straightforward: many of the city's residents visit malarious areas and have visitors from these regions. </p> <p>The factors behind TB are more complex and disputed. It is a disease that can lie latent in someone's body for their entire life and develops to an infectious stage only in a minority of cases. What causes this transition has been described as the \"holy grail\" of TB research by Mike Barer, professor of clinical epidemiology at Leicester University. </p> <p>At the turn of the 19th century, TB was rife in London and New York, but vaccination and effective treatment appears to have led to its decline in the first 40 years of the 20th century.

      "bodyText": "When a tuberculosis notification lands on the desk of Surinder Bakhshi, the first thing the doctor wants to know is the patient's race. \"When I get a lab report through on a TB case, I first check which ethnic community it has occurred in. If it is in a community where I would not expect it, that worries me,\" says Bakhshi, a consultant in communicable disease control. For while TB can infect any race, it is one of several illnesses, including coronary heart disease and sickle cell anaemia, that show dramatic variations in incidence depending on ethnic group. In Birmingham in 1999 people of Afro-Caribbean origin were five times more likely to suffer from TB than the indigenous white population. The rate was 20 times greater among people of Indian descent and 26 times higher among people of Pakistani origin. Leicester - one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the UK - had a TB rate that was four times the national average even before the current outbreak at Crown Hills Community College; last week numbers linked to this outbreak climbed to 50. The rate of coronary heart disease in Bradford among people of Bangladeshi origin is 30% above the national average for women, and 75% higher for men. Discussion about the reasons for these variations can be difficult. It seems that just as party leaders Tony Blair, William Hague and Charles Kennedy have agreed not to play the \"race card\" in the coming general election, so some healthcare professionals are cautious of spelling out how someone's ethnicity can affect personal health. Yet healthcare planners do take these factors into account in devising services. Earlier this year Leicester Royal Infirmary announced that it would build a \u00a31.8m infectious diseases wing. It will take cases of TB, drug-resistant diseases and tropical fevers such as malaria. Malaria is not contagious but it can be confused with fevers that are, and it is being seen more frequently in Leicester's health centres. The reason is straightforward: many of the city's residents visit malarious areas and have visitors from these regions. The factors behind TB are more complex and disputed. It is a disease that can lie latent in someone's body for their entire life and develops to an infectious stage only in a minority of cases. What causes this transition has been described as the \"holy grail\" of TB research by Mike Barer, professor of clinical epidemiology at Leicester University. At the turn of the 19th century, TB was rife in London and New York, but vaccination and effective treatment appears to have led to its decline in the first 40 years of the 20th century. However, since 1987 its incidence has risen by 34%. The public health laboratory service attributes this increase in part to immigrants moving to Britain from countries that have a high prevalence of the disease. But making a link between immigration and disease can be contentious. Elizabeth Anionwu, head of the Mary Seacole centre for nursing practice at Thames Valley University, says: \"Like many people, I get very hot under the collar when people start talking about ethnic groups 'bringing disease' into this country. \"It is not because of their background that certain groups of the population are [sicker].

      "body": "<p>A premier division of 40 top NHS hospitals in Britain was named yesterday by an international firm of health care consultants.</p> <p>The company, CHKS, drew up the list using recent confidential data from NHS trusts which employ it to measure their performance against one another.</p> <p>The 40 range from local hospitals in rural areas to big urban teaching hospital trusts. Performance data was adjusted to take account of patients' different medical conditions and circumstances.</p> <p>For 10 years CHKS has produced similar lists of 100 top hospitals in the US and for two years it has published a top 20 for Spain. This was the first attempt to draw up a table of excellence for Britain.</p> <p>Graham Harries, the company's chief executive, said the results were not a league table. The top 40 could not be ranked in order of excellence and was not an exclusive list of all the high quality hospitals. The company measures performance in 115 NHS trusts - nearly half the total. About 75 of them volunteered for this exercise.</p> <p>Mr Harries said: \"This is not about success or failure but about celebrating the good in the NHS. Our staff work with these hospitals day in, day out, and we know they welcome the way we measure their performance so that they can improve where there are signs of weakness. What all the top 40 hospitals have achieved is a high level of performance across all the indicators, and that demonstrates to us and to their local residents that their hospitals are well managed and focused on the needs of their patients.\"</p> <p>The hospitals were measured against 13 criteria including mortality rates, adjusted to take account of variations in the types of illness in each hospital's case load.</p> <p>Other measures included readmission rates, the time taken to discharge stroke and hip patients, length of stay in hospital and the proportion of patients waiting less than six months. Figures were based on performance last year and were more up to date than government performance tables.</p> <p>\"For the first time we have a group of hospitals across the UK which has passed a series of rigorous tests that they themselves volunteered for... We applaud their openness and determination to provide the very best services to patients,\" Mr Harries said.</p> <p>Asked what benefits the findings would have for patients, he said: \"I think they will be able to have more confidence in the way they would approach their hospitals if they have to go into them.</p> <p>\"It's clearly important to make statements about things that are wrong but, on occasions, it's very positive to dwell on the things we do well.\"</p> <p>He added: \"All the participating hospitals have taken a step forward.

      "bodyText": "A premier division of 40 top NHS hospitals in Britain was named yesterday by an international firm of health care consultants. The company, CHKS, drew up the list using recent confidential data from NHS trusts which employ it to measure their performance against one another. The 40 range from local hospitals in rural areas to big urban teaching hospital trusts. Performance data was adjusted to take account of patients' different medical conditions and circumstances. For 10 years CHKS has produced similar lists of 100 top hospitals in the US and for two years it has published a top 20 for Spain. This was the first attempt to draw up a table of excellence for Britain. Graham Harries, the company's chief executive, said the results were not a league table. The top 40 could not be ranked in order of excellence and was not an exclusive list of all the high quality hospitals. The company measures performance in 115 NHS trusts - nearly half the total. About 75 of them volunteered for this exercise. Mr Harries said: \"This is not about success or failure but about celebrating the good in the NHS. Our staff work with these hospitals day in, day out, and we know they welcome the way we measure their performance so that they can improve where there are signs of weakness. What all the top 40 hospitals have achieved is a high level of performance across all the indicators, and that demonstrates to us and to their local residents that their hospitals are well managed and focused on the needs of their patients.\" The hospitals were measured against 13 criteria including mortality rates, adjusted to take account of variations in the types of illness in each hospital's case load. Other measures included readmission rates, the time taken to discharge stroke and hip patients, length of stay in hospital and the proportion of patients waiting less than six months. Figures were based on performance last year and were more up to date than government performance tables. \"For the first time we have a group of hospitals across the UK which has passed a series of rigorous tests that they themselves volunteered for... We applaud their openness and determination to provide the very best services to patients,\" Mr Harries said. Asked what benefits the findings would have for patients, he said: \"I think they will be able to have more confidence in the way they would approach their hospitals if they have to go into them. \"It's clearly important to make statements about things that are wrong but, on occasions, it's very positive to dwell on the things we do well.\" He added: \"All the participating hospitals have taken a step forward. They have been willing to be compared and bold enough to start improving. They will be better informed by having data and information to use.\" An average week at all the top 40 hospitals included 50,000 patient admissions, of which 17,000 were emergencies. A total of 2,300 children were born, 190 hips replaced, 130 heart bypasses carried out and one heart transplant operation performed.

But the poll shows that an overwhelming majority of the public believe that there is a need for an urgent modernisation of the monarchy, and that, despite the efforts of the palace's \"way ahead\" group, its efforts to reinvent the royal family have still got a very long way to go in the public's mind. ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,005 adults aged over 18 by telephone between April 20-22. The interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. Useful link Latest ICM polls",

      "bodyText": "Political parties need to do more to address older people's fear of crime if they are to secure their vote at the general election, according to an opinion poll published today by Help the Aged. The charity found crime was nearly twice as important as any other issue when older people on low incomes were asked to name the key priority for improvement in their area. The survey by Mori found crime was the most pressing concern for 31% of the 504 over 65-year-olds living on less than \u00a36,500 a year who were questioned. This compared with 17% citing money and pensions, 13% mentioning public transport and 9% saying health. The survey found 55% believed that crime had increased over the past four years. The same proportion said they were afraid of intruders entering their home and 61% were afraid of their home being burgled. Half were afraid to go out at night alone. Women aged between 65 and 74 were the most afraid of crime, with 64% admitting to being scared of going out at night alone, while 34% of men of the same age said the same. Mervyn Kohler, of Help the Aged, said: \"Older people regularly raise crime as an important political issue, despite them being statistically less likely to be victims of crime. \"Their fear of crime is likely to stem from degradation of the community in which they live as much as from the threat of violence.\" The charity appealed to the political parties to develop policies to help older people enjoy social activities instead of turning their homes into fortifications to keep out intruders. Providing reliable and accessible public transport, better street lighting and visible policing would make a start in addressing these problems and boost the quality of life in local communities, Mr Kohler said. The survey found older people in the north of England were more afraid of crime than those in the south, with 53% of northerners too afraid to go out alone at night compared to 49% of pensioners in the south and 48% in the midlands/eastern England region. Mr Kohler said the results sent out a strong message to the parties that the concerns of older people could not be ignored. Robert Worcester, chairman of Mori, said: \"The over 55s have four times the political clout of the under 25s: there are twice as many of them and they are twice as likely to vote.\"",

Close Encounters, which was created by UK format specialist The Chatterbox Partnership, has been bought by US cable channel USA Network. In the show two contestants are secretly filmed for a week going about their everyday lives, which includes getting involved in situations set up by the Close Encounters production team. The secret filming is then revealed to the participants, who can win cash prizes by correctly recalling what they have been doing in the previous week. The Close Encounters format sale to USA Network is Chatterbox's first US format deal. Chatterbox, which was set up by Ben Hall and Tom Ellemann, has created formats including It's a Small World, Pass the Buck and Whose House. The Close Encounters deal was signed with Chris Sloan, the senior vice-president, reality programming and specials at USA Network.

      "bodyText": "Junichiro Koizumi, a reformer promising tough love for Japan, is to be the next prime minister after a surprise victory yesterday in voting for the leadership of the conservative ruling party. Defying all predictions, the former health minister rode a wave of popular support to overwhelm the traditionally powerful factional interests represented by his three rivals for the presidency of the Liberal Democratic party (LDP). Guaranteed the post of prime minister by the ruling coalition's majority in parliament, he will inaugurate a cabinet tomorrow that is expected to be the youngest and most reform-minded that Japan has seen in decades. He has also pledged to push aggressive reforms of the banking system, cap the issuance of government bonds and break up the LDP's factions. Mr Koizumi, 59, is an immensely popular politician whose selection is likely to boost the ratings of the LDP in the upper house election in July. In opinion polls, 51% of floating voters said they wanted him as head of the ruling party. \"At last we have a real leader,\" one woman told a local television station. In primaries leading up to yesterday's election, Mr Koizumi swept 123 of the 141 regional votes that were at stake, making it politically impossible for the party's grandees to deny him victory. In the final count, which included a poll of MPs, he won 293 votes, putting him far ahead of his next closest rival, the former prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, with 155. \"It is unbelievable that I received such huge support,\" he said after the victory. \"It is the individual citizens who moved politics.\" \"It is my responsibility to rebuild the party so that we can say with confidence that the LDP will change Japan and move ahead with major reforms.\" Mr Koizumi cuts an unusually colourful figure in the grey world of Japanese politics. Compared to the cheap suits and short-back-and-sides hairstyles that are alomst de rigueur among LDP members, Japan's new leader is a sharp dresser with long grey permed hair. A divorcee, who has two sons from a marriage with a woman 14 years his junior, \"Jun-chan\" as he is nicknamed, lists his hobbies as skiing, movies, Kabuki and singing karaoke. As a well known fan of an outlandishly dressed pop group, X-Japan, he helped to set up a memorial museum for the band's lead singer, who committed suicide. His policies, particularly his advocacy of privatising Japan's huge postal savings network, have also earned him the reputation as a political punk inside the LDP: the party gets much of its money and support from the postal lobby. \"Jun-chan is a little different from your run-of-the mill politician. He doesn't make decisions based on personal interests. He is a politician who respects theories and logic,\" said one of the other three leadership candidates, Shizuka Kamei, before dropping out and throwing his support behind Mr Koizumi. \"He may prove to be a tough character on the international scene.\" Audio: Koizumi plans painful reform for Japan",

He pledges by 2004 to clear up the bad loans held by financial institutions - estimated at between 30,000bn and 100,000bn yen (\u00a3172bn-\u00a3573bn) - even if it means two years of recession.</p> <p>If he can pull it off, this would be a major policy shift.

The result was a stunning setback for the party gerontocracy, who have held sway over Japanese political life for decades. It was also about as close to a display of people power as Japan gets. With support from 80% of the party's regions and the vast majority of its members, he can claim the clearest mandate for change in the country's modern history. Change, however, will be painful. Mr Koizumi has promised a period of creative destruction: large-scale structural reform that will shake out the ailing banking sector and test weak companies' mettle. He pledges by 2004 to clear up the bad loans held by financial institutions - estimated at between 30,000bn and 100,000bn yen (\u00a3172bn-\u00a3573bn) - even if it means two years of recession. If he can pull it off, this would be a major policy shift. Since the financial crisis of 1997-98, successive administrations have said the economy is too weak for such major surgery. \"We cannot wait any longer for reform,\" Mr Koizumi said during his campaign. \"Yes, there will be bankruptcy and unemployment, but if we fear this and postpone the necessary remedies, then we will never see a recovery of the Japanese economy.\" Mr Koizumi insists reform and deregulation are the answer, but his party is a collection of lobbies - such as the building industry and postal workers - with a vested interest in obstructing change. The first test of his sincerity will be his choice of a new cabinet, which will be unveiled later this week; he has promised to ignore the usual faction balancing act and to appoint solely on talent, including more women and young politicians. He will find it difficult not to reward the factions that supported him, however. And if he needed reminding of the price of failure, he need only to look at the rival he defeated yesterday, the former prime minster Ryutaro Hashimoto. Mr Hashimoto came to power on a similar promise of reform in 1996. But in little more than two years the country was in crisis and voters had dubbed him public enemy number one.",

      "body": "<p>Yesterday morning we estimated that only 10% of our flock is left to lamb, but this week has not started well. Before breakfast on Monday, a ewe died suddenly in the lambing shed. Archie, our lambing shepherd, thinks she choked on something, as she started to cough loudly and within two or three minutes was dead, leaving two lambs without a mother. I shouldn't have mentioned pet lambs last week - it was obviously tempting fate.</p> <p>Feeding the orphans is a battle of wills - our patience versus their stubbornness. They have not yet worked out that the warm powdered milk is for them to swallow. Instead it dribbles out of their mouths, runs down our waterproof trousers and collects in a pool on the floor. We hope their hunger will finally win them round, or that we can find them a new mother. But as there are only five Mule sheep left to lamb, and because the Scottish Blackface ewes (a smaller and tougher breed than the Mule) can only manage to feed one Suffolk cross lamb, this becomes harder and harder to arrange.</p> <p>Out in the fields the lambs are thriving. Their docked tails are finally dropping off and for them life is fun. They play, fight, leap and jump over and over again before having a feed and a sleep and starting once more. We love to watch them racing one another over a hillock or along the top of a bank, full of the joys of living. But this is a transient stage, as once they start to graze on the grass for themselves and endlessly chew the cud, they age almost overnight, becoming very middle-aged in outlook.</p> <p>Yesterday morning we awoke to a dense fog which slowed us down: it was impossible to check the ewes and lambs properly. Visibility increased to around 50 yards after breakfast but many of our fields are large (up to 100 acres) and looking around properly was impossible. The evening check needed to be even more thorough than usual.</p> <p>I think the tension is beginning to ease a little in the countryside as the days go by and the number of reported cases goes down. But the dire warnings and confusing advice from Maff and the NFU keep the stress levels pretty high. Cattle farmers have been told to turn their cattle out separately from their sheep; to keep a road, wood, river or empty field as a barrier between the species; and not to use any fields that have been grazed by livestock since mid-February. We have also been advised to contact our vet for further guidance and to ask for a blood test if we cannot segregate the species.</p> <p>This may seem reasonable in order to protect the national cattle herd, but Peter says we can't possibly run the stock separately, so I have just rung the vet. He is amazed by this advice. Cattle out at grass act as sentinels: they show the disease clearly, whereas the sheep could be harbouring it without showing obvious signs. So we could lose a vital early warning system.</p> <p>The vet also thinks it is dangerous to give farmers the idea that if they leave a field break between farms they might be safe if their neighbours go down. Because with the contiguous culling policy now in full swing, it simply does not work like that. Also, we all know there are neither enough vets nor enough laboratory facilities to blood-test the sheep on farms like ours; and no laboratory will accept blood samples taken within an infected area anyway. (Although eventually, blood-testing of flocks may be the only way forward to lift the infected-area status of the northern region.)</p> <p>We all think our flock is healthy and hope it remains that way. They have lambed reasonably well and we have had no sudden lamb deaths in the field, which I've discovered is a clear sign of an infected flock. We've had no more disasters than usual - as any farmer will tell you, when you keep livestock, you always have deadstock, too.</p> <p>In the meantime, we will all be happier on this cluster of farms when we get beyond 28-30 days from the two Hallington outbreaks. These occurred on April 1 and 5, so we're not out of the woods yet. Peter has started to take down some of the lambing pens and muck out the soiled bedding with the JCB. This dirty straw is not saved for manure but burnt, as it is thoroughly soiled and could harbour a multitude of bacteria, including Ecoli, joint ill and other unpleasant germs.

      "bodyText": "Yesterday morning we estimated that only 10% of our flock is left to lamb, but this week has not started well. Before breakfast on Monday, a ewe died suddenly in the lambing shed. Archie, our lambing shepherd, thinks she choked on something, as she started to cough loudly and within two or three minutes was dead, leaving two lambs without a mother. I shouldn't have mentioned pet lambs last week - it was obviously tempting fate. Feeding the orphans is a battle of wills - our patience versus their stubbornness. They have not yet worked out that the warm powdered milk is for them to swallow. Instead it dribbles out of their mouths, runs down our waterproof trousers and collects in a pool on the floor. We hope their hunger will finally win them round, or that we can find them a new mother. But as there are only five Mule sheep left to lamb, and because the Scottish Blackface ewes (a smaller and tougher breed than the Mule) can only manage to feed one Suffolk cross lamb, this becomes harder and harder to arrange. Out in the fields the lambs are thriving. Their docked tails are finally dropping off and for them life is fun. They play, fight, leap and jump over and over again before having a feed and a sleep and starting once more. We love to watch them racing one another over a hillock or along the top of a bank, full of the joys of living. But this is a transient stage, as once they start to graze on the grass for themselves and endlessly chew the cud, they age almost overnight, becoming very middle-aged in outlook. Yesterday morning we awoke to a dense fog which slowed us down: it was impossible to check the ewes and lambs properly. Visibility increased to around 50 yards after breakfast but many of our fields are large (up to 100 acres) and looking around properly was impossible. The evening check needed to be even more thorough than usual. I think the tension is beginning to ease a little in the countryside as the days go by and the number of reported cases goes down. But the dire warnings and confusing advice from Maff and the NFU keep the stress levels pretty high. Cattle farmers have been told to turn their cattle out separately from their sheep; to keep a road, wood, river or empty field as a barrier between the species; and not to use any fields that have been grazed by livestock since mid-February. We have also been advised to contact our vet for further guidance and to ask for a blood test if we cannot segregate the species. This may seem reasonable in order to protect the national cattle herd, but Peter says we can't possibly run the stock separately, so I have just rung the vet. He is amazed by this advice. Cattle out at grass act as sentinels: they show the disease clearly, whereas the sheep could be harbouring it without showing obvious signs. So we could lose a vital early warning system. The vet also thinks it is dangerous to give farmers the idea that if they leave a field break between farms they might be safe if their neighbours go down. Because with the contiguous culling policy now in full swing, it simply does not work like that. Also, we all know there are neither enough vets nor enough laboratory facilities to blood-test the sheep on farms like ours; and no laboratory will accept blood samples taken within an infected area anyway. (Although eventually, blood-testing of flocks may be the only way forward to lift the infected-area status of the northern region.) We all think our flock is healthy and hope it remains that way. They have lambed reasonably well and we have had no sudden lamb deaths in the field, which I've discovered is a clear sign of an infected flock. We've had no more disasters than usual - as any farmer will tell you, when you keep livestock, you always have deadstock, too. In the meantime, we will all be happier on this cluster of farms when we get beyond 28-30 days from the two Hallington outbreaks. These occurred on April 1 and 5, so we're not out of the woods yet. Peter has started to take down some of the lambing pens and muck out the soiled bedding with the JCB. This dirty straw is not saved for manure but burnt, as it is thoroughly soiled and could harbour a multitude of bacteria, including Ecoli, joint ill and other unpleasant germs. Every wooden hurdle and water bucket is thoroughly steam-cleaned and put away until the next lambing - whenever that might be. Just as my deadline is reached, I can report that we have managed to set one of the pet lambs on to a ewe. One down, one to go! \u0095 The writer and her husband run a livestock farm near Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland. Her diary will return on Friday.

      "body": "<p>The Ministry of Agriculture turned down a US government offer - made at the beginning of the foot and mouth outbreak - of a simple, reliable test which could have avoided the needless culling of a million or more healthy animals, according to one of the world's experts on the disease.</p> <p>Accusing Maff of spreading misery by dogmatically pursuing \"10-year-old science\", Fred Brown, former deputy head of the world foot and mouth research laboratory at Pirbright and now at the US animal disease centre, said that the test could have been done on up to 24 farms at a time and easily identified which animals had the disease.</p> <p>\"The US department of agriculture offered it to Maff on March 9 [week three of the crisis]. It's a hand-held test kit, you just press the button and it comes up with the answer in two to three hours. It is very accurate. They said they were 'too busy'. That saddened me a lot\", he said. \"Why destroy innocent animals? This is not like cutting down a forest.\"</p> <p>Professor Brown said that an \"unacceptable level\" of healthy animals had already been slaughtered. The only way to move forward on a civilised basis, he said, was to instigate an immediate vaccination policy. The latest Maff figures suggest that more than 2m animals have been slaughtered but unofficially Maff admits that only 1% may have actually caught the disease.</p> <p>\"Vaccination is a success story\", said Prof Brown, who worked on the 1981 small foot and mouth outbreak on the Isle of Wight. \"When it was clear the disease was out of control, they should have vaccinated.</p> <p>\"The archaic view of the importance of disease-free status should be the subject of international debate.\" He was joined in London by Simon Barteling, a Dutch consultant who has spent 30 years investigating foot and mouth outbreaks around the world. He accused the European commission of trying to prevent the Dutch vaccination policy. This has brought Holland's outbreaks under control in less than 14 days.</p> <p>\"I always wondered why the British refused to vaccinate\", said Dr Barteling. \"Clearly if you cannot trace the contacts then it was out of hand. You then have to vaccinate or face a long history of human harm in all your rural areas.\"</p> <p>Dr Barteling also dismissed the National Farmers' Union prime objection to vaccination which has always been that vaccinated animals can remain carriers and spread the disease. \"This has been very much blown up,\" he said. \"There is no well-documented case where a vaccinated animal has caused a disease. Billions of animals have been successfully vaccinated. There is a strong indication that though you may find carriers they do not pass it on.\"</p> <p>Dr Barteling feared that the disease could remain in the national flock or herd and appear to die away over the summer but return in the autumn when the weather conditions suited it.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Department of Health warned that anyone living within 3km of a large pyre could experience a worsening of asthma conditions and should avoid \"sustained exposure\" to the smoke, dioxins and particles emitted. They advised that people growing vegetables near a pyre to wash their produce but said that dioxins in the soil posed no immediate or long-term hazards.</p> <p>The ministry said that private water supplies could be vulnerable to contamination by surface water run off from carcasses left lying on the ground and from animals buried in unlined sites.</p> <p>Mike Childs, campaign director of Friends of the Earth, said: \"The government is trying to pull the wool over people's eyes. In December European scientists called for renewed efforts to reduce people's exposure to dioxins.</p> <p>\"The UK government has even produced a report warning that people are exposed to too many dioxins. Alarmingly it also says that babies may be exposed to between 27 and 144 times above World Health Organisation safe levels. Simply telling people to scrub their vegetable won't wash.\"</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,474590,00.html\">Explained: vaccination</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">Explained: the spread of foot and mouth</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,471911,00.html\">Foot and mouth in Europe</a></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,475723,00.html\">20.04.2001: The jab of conscience</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br> </p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/footandmouth/story/0,7369,477153,00.html\">23.04.2001: Crisis prompts increase in rural borrowing</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,477152,00.html\">23.04.2001: Government ignored disease risk</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,476880,00.html\">23.04.2001: Cancer fear from animal pyre chemicals</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,476966,00.html\">23.04.2001: US tourists may not return for years</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,476894,00.html\">23.04.2001: Farmer found hanged</a><br></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>More on the countryside in crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\">16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html\">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><b>Cartoons</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html\">28.03.2001: Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html\">29.03.2001: Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth\">Foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/footandmouth/\">Election 2001: foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\">BSE</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>Net notes</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

      "bodyText": "The Ministry of Agriculture turned down a US government offer - made at the beginning of the foot and mouth outbreak - of a simple, reliable test which could have avoided the needless culling of a million or more healthy animals, according to one of the world's experts on the disease. Accusing Maff of spreading misery by dogmatically pursuing \"10-year-old science\", Fred Brown, former deputy head of the world foot and mouth research laboratory at Pirbright and now at the US animal disease centre, said that the test could have been done on up to 24 farms at a time and easily identified which animals had the disease. \"The US department of agriculture offered it to Maff on March 9 [week three of the crisis]. It's a hand-held test kit, you just press the button and it comes up with the answer in two to three hours. It is very accurate. They said they were 'too busy'. That saddened me a lot\", he said. \"Why destroy innocent animals? This is not like cutting down a forest.\" Professor Brown said that an \"unacceptable level\" of healthy animals had already been slaughtered. The only way to move forward on a civilised basis, he said, was to instigate an immediate vaccination policy. The latest Maff figures suggest that more than 2m animals have been slaughtered but unofficially Maff admits that only 1% may have actually caught the disease. \"Vaccination is a success story\", said Prof Brown, who worked on the 1981 small foot and mouth outbreak on the Isle of Wight. \"When it was clear the disease was out of control, they should have vaccinated. \"The archaic view of the importance of disease-free status should be the subject of international debate.\" He was joined in London by Simon Barteling, a Dutch consultant who has spent 30 years investigating foot and mouth outbreaks around the world. He accused the European commission of trying to prevent the Dutch vaccination policy. This has brought Holland's outbreaks under control in less than 14 days. \"I always wondered why the British refused to vaccinate\", said Dr Barteling. \"Clearly if you cannot trace the contacts then it was out of hand. You then have to vaccinate or face a long history of human harm in all your rural areas.\" Dr Barteling also dismissed the National Farmers' Union prime objection to vaccination which has always been that vaccinated animals can remain carriers and spread the disease. \"This has been very much blown up,\" he said. \"There is no well-documented case where a vaccinated animal has caused a disease. Billions of animals have been successfully vaccinated. There is a strong indication that though you may find carriers they do not pass it on.\" Dr Barteling feared that the disease could remain in the national flock or herd and appear to die away over the summer but return in the autumn when the weather conditions suited it. Meanwhile the Department of Health warned that anyone living within 3km of a large pyre could experience a worsening of asthma conditions and should avoid \"sustained exposure\" to the smoke, dioxins and particles emitted. They advised that people growing vegetables near a pyre to wash their produce but said that dioxins in the soil posed no immediate or long-term hazards. The ministry said that private water supplies could be vulnerable to contamination by surface water run off from carcasses left lying on the ground and from animals buried in unlined sites. Mike Childs, campaign director of Friends of the Earth, said: \"The government is trying to pull the wool over people's eyes. In December European scientists called for renewed efforts to reduce people's exposure to dioxins. \"The UK government has even produced a report warning that people are exposed to too many dioxins. Alarmingly it also says that babies may be exposed to between 27 and 144 times above World Health Organisation safe levels. Simply telling people to scrub their vegetable won't wash.\" Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up What's going on?

      "body": "<p>A disciplinary hearing, set up at huge expense to investigate claims that a forensic pathologist botched postmortem examinations, has collapsed in embarrassing circumstances.</p> <p>Days before the Home Office tribunal was due to finish, a month after it started, all four of the panel hearing the case against Paula Lannas declared they should step down to avoid a conflict of interest.</p> <p>Dr Lannas is left in limbo while a decision is made over whether there will be further proceedings. She has had little work for two years while the case has been pending.</p> <p>Critics believe the collapse also raises questions about the policy advisory board for forensic pathology, which is responsible for the tribunal.</p> <p>The board is chaired by Gordon Thomas, acting head of the Home Office's science and technology unit. One of its roles is to maintain a list of pathologists approved for working with police and coroners on suspicious deaths.</p> <p>One pathologist, who asked not to be named, said last night: \"This is going to call into question the credibility of the board. How can the public, let alone coroners and the police, have confidence in the crucial work it does if it can't run a disciplinary hearing?\"</p> <p>Since 1990 Dr Lannas, who qualified as a doctor in 1974, has performed more than 7,300 autopsies, including almost 400 on people who died in suspicious circumstances.</p> <p>She was involved in the cases of Leah Betts, who died after taking an ecstasy tablet on her 18th birthday in 1995, and Joy Gardner, who died in 1993 after police tried to arrest her for deportation.</p> <p>But in 1996 Dr Lannas's work came under scrutiny.

      "bodyText": "A disciplinary hearing, set up at huge expense to investigate claims that a forensic pathologist botched postmortem examinations, has collapsed in embarrassing circumstances. Days before the Home Office tribunal was due to finish, a month after it started, all four of the panel hearing the case against Paula Lannas declared they should step down to avoid a conflict of interest. Dr Lannas is left in limbo while a decision is made over whether there will be further proceedings. She has had little work for two years while the case has been pending. Critics believe the collapse also raises questions about the policy advisory board for forensic pathology, which is responsible for the tribunal. The board is chaired by Gordon Thomas, acting head of the Home Office's science and technology unit. One of its roles is to maintain a list of pathologists approved for working with police and coroners on suspicious deaths. One pathologist, who asked not to be named, said last night: \"This is going to call into question the credibility of the board. How can the public, let alone coroners and the police, have confidence in the crucial work it does if it can't run a disciplinary hearing?\" Since 1990 Dr Lannas, who qualified as a doctor in 1974, has performed more than 7,300 autopsies, including almost 400 on people who died in suspicious circumstances. She was involved in the cases of Leah Betts, who died after taking an ecstasy tablet on her 18th birthday in 1995, and Joy Gardner, who died in 1993 after police tried to arrest her for deportation. But in 1996 Dr Lannas's work came under scrutiny. After years of investigation by the board's quality assurance and scientific standards committee, the disciplinary tribunal convened - for the first time - at the Holiday Inn in Rotherhithe, south-east London, last month. It heard that two Essex coroners had stopped her from performing autopsies in their areas. In three cases, it was claimed, she failed to carry out a \"vital aspect of the autopsy\". Also investigated, the tribunal heard, was a postmortem examination on a baby who police believed had been murdered. So \"suspect\" were her conclusions that at a trial the prosecution told the jury it could not rely on her evidence. Proceedings were being watched by at least one team of lawyers representing a person convicted after a trial at which Dr Lannas gave evidence. However, her team were confident that she would win the tribunal case. In a statement at the start they said: \"Dr Lannas maintains that throughout her career she has acted properly and professionally.\" She was giving evidence when the case collapsed last Friday. Her lawyer, Robert Sumerling, said yesterday the turn of events was \"entirely unexpected\". Dr Lannas was \"very concerned and upset\". He said her team had drawn attention to what they believed was a \"problem\" with one of the panel. Next day the panel announced that they would all be standing down. The Home Office would not discuss details of the case. It said only that the tribunal had been \"discontinued\" because members had \"recused themselves because information came to their attention which could have been viewed as prejudicial\". In a legal context, to recuse means to withdraw from a hearing because of a possible conflict of interest or lack of impartiality. One legal source said: \"This must be a great embarrassment to the Home Office. It is bound to have cost hundreds of thousands of pounds to bring this case ... This is the first time this tribunal has met, and it will probably now be the only time.\"",

I was beaten up, sometimes with cables, sometimes for an hour they would beat me. \"They're going to kill me, I know what they're like. I won't let them kill me, I'll kill myself.\" Ali Rahimi, a solicitor who says he has had 100 Iraqi clients refused asylum since October, said: \"Returning to Iraq ... is absolutely terrifying for them. People can not believe what they see in the refusal letters. All they see is that this government is proposing to send them back to Iraq, the same government that has been in a state of war with Iraq for the last 10 years.\"",

      "body": "<p>Claire Burt stands on the bridge of the RV Triton, an experimental trimaran warship, and looks out at the imposing bulk of HMS Illustrious, the aircraft carrier, berthed just up the quay in Portsmouth naval dockyard. As project manager for the vessel, commissioned by the defence evaluation and research agency, rebranded as QinetiQ, she's excited by the prospects for the vessel and her enthusiasm is infectious. </p> <p>On May 9 Triton, in the middle of trials, sails for America where it is being offered to the navy and the coastguard. The 97m vessel is equipped with 500 sensors monitoring her stresses and performance, notably in high seas and force 9 gales. </p> <p>Back in Southampton, Martin Jay, the chief executive of Vosper Thornycroft, which built Triton and delivered it last August, two months ahead of schedule, says casually: \"There's an innovative verve about this company. You can't imagine a BAE yard building it.\" Behind his irony lies a bitterness about the ruthless manner in which Britain's premier defence contractor is trying to muscle Vosper out of the warship business - as Jay sees it. </p> <p>There is more to this than David versus Goliath. The struggle between Vosper and BAE Systems touches the quick of how the government should ensure national security and value for taxpayers' money in an era of unprecedented peace - and vicious regional conflicts. Is competition the way to avoid the costly delays that have characterised procurement in the past? Or, like the French, should Britain allow its national champion to monopolise the market and force smaller rivals into niche segments - at a time when globalisation is producing fewer, bigger suppliers and forcing greater dependence between these and their customers? Does competition create two weak rivals incapable of efficiency and innovation? </p> <p>These strategic issues are being addressed by companies with the traditional use of ferocious lobbying power, political threats, industrial muscle and the whole sorry panoply of bloody bolshieness that passes for defence acquisition - what Jay calls \"dirty deals done in dark corners\". Shareholders sweat; employees fear for their jobs; industry executives spend more time in Whitehall cajoling and backstabbing than running their companies. </p> <p>The immediate issue is who shall build 12 Type 45 destroyers for the Royal Navy in a contract worth up to \u00a36bn, with an in-service date of 2007. In July 2000 the MoD decided the first three should be divided, with Vosper building one and BAE Marine, part of the aerospace group, two. BAES remained prime contractor, main driver of an alliance of the warship builders and the defence procurement agency. </p> <p>That alliance collapsed last December when BAE Marine made an unsolicited bid to build all 12 Type 45s - an offer being evaluated by Sir Robert Walmesley, chief of defence procurement, and to be considered by ministers who are unlikely to act before June 7. BAE insiders insist their hand was forced because Jay and the Vosper board rejected an agreed structure, process and price for the contract and put in a higher, take-it-or-leave-it price. </p> <p>BAE says its offer represents greater value and, if the project comes in below the price, the savings will be shared with the exchequer. It has effectively told Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, and Sir Robert it wants to be sole builder of bigger, more complex warships while Vosper and its peers can design and build smaller craft. It has offered Vosper free rein to build naval ships below 85m - which it would then market abroad for the Southampton company. Vosper cried foul. Monopolists, they shouted. Its far bigger rival (and occasional joint venture partner), forced to issue a profits warning in January because of cost overruns and losses on other MoD contracts, was trying to solve its problems by coercing Whitehall into allowing it control of the warship market. </p> <p>The monopolist charge sticks, certainly with BAE's main competitors. \"Competition is something which is necessary, helpful and good for the customer; any restriction of markets is a disease,\" says one senior European defence executive. \"BAE Systems is telling the world it wants to be the monopoly supplier in the UK and demanding open access to the US, European and other markets.\" </p> <p>BAES's military-industrial-political power is such that even its bitterest rivals do deals with it, often afraid to take it on. Jay, fighting to retain warship building as a part of Vosper's business (albeit one that accounts for 30% of sales and profits) brushes aside the \"fear factor\" and ac cuses BAES of trying to hold the government to ransom. </p> <p>His reasoning is simple. BAES, via its merger with the then GEC's defence electronics division, inherited three shipyards - Barrow in Furness, and Govan and Scotstoun on the Clyde - and needs to invest \u00a3147m to bring them up to date. It has admitted that at least one of these is surplus to needs (probably Scotstoun) while Govan, empty of work, is losing \u00a33m a month or more. Jay claims BAE Marine can submit a lower price only because the mother group, as prime contractor, can recoup the losses further up the supply chain. </p> <p>It is not an argument that cuts much ice with BAES which denies it seeks a monopoly. Rather, it says, it wants a \"strategic restructuring\" of the warship industry that will bring an end to the cyclical nature of MoD work which in turn forces it to spread programmes around Britain's yards - often with disastrous results, as at Cammell Laird. \"It's a great opportunity to get some security into the industry, stop playing Russian roulette with people's jobs and improve our performance in export markets,\" say insiders. </p> <p>Its counter-argument is that its approach, by ensuring economies of scale, will bring greater value for money and make capital investment that much less risky. Jay, in turn, says forcibly that open competition - \"It's written into the very fabric of this company\" - will encourage innovation, cost control and greater productivity and his company has a track record in this regard. \"We've consistently been profitable; they're losing money,\" he says, prompting the reply from BAES: \"He doesn't want competition; he wants allocation - and taxpayers' funds to build the new yard for the destroyers in Portsmouth.\" </p> <p>So far, in this increasingly nasty dogfight, Vosper has gained the upper hand in terms of public support. Its case won't necessarily cut the mustard in Whitehall where senior insiders say: \"This is not just about Type 45s but the future direction of the warship construction industry in the UK, especially the production of highly complex ships such as carriers, frigates, destroyers and assault vessels.\" BAES, on the other hand, has too often overplayed its powerful hand and created enemies, not least among important ministers. </p> <p>The only certain outcome is that the ships will be British-built.</p>",

You can't imagine a BAE yard building it.\" Behind his irony lies a bitterness about the ruthless manner in which Britain's premier defence contractor is trying to muscle Vosper out of the warship business - as Jay sees it. There is more to this than David versus Goliath. The struggle between Vosper and BAE Systems touches the quick of how the government should ensure national security and value for taxpayers' money in an era of unprecedented peace - and vicious regional conflicts. Is competition the way to avoid the costly delays that have characterised procurement in the past? Or, like the French, should Britain allow its national champion to monopolise the market and force smaller rivals into niche segments - at a time when globalisation is producing fewer, bigger suppliers and forcing greater dependence between these and their customers? Does competition create two weak rivals incapable of efficiency and innovation? These strategic issues are being addressed by companies with the traditional use of ferocious lobbying power, political threats, industrial muscle and the whole sorry panoply of bloody bolshieness that passes for defence acquisition - what Jay calls \"dirty deals done in dark corners\". Shareholders sweat; employees fear for their jobs; industry executives spend more time in Whitehall cajoling and backstabbing than running their companies. The immediate issue is who shall build 12 Type 45 destroyers for the Royal Navy in a contract worth up to \u00a36bn, with an in-service date of 2007. In July 2000 the MoD decided the first three should be divided, with Vosper building one and BAE Marine, part of the aerospace group, two. BAES remained prime contractor, main driver of an alliance of the warship builders and the defence procurement agency. That alliance collapsed last December when BAE Marine made an unsolicited bid to build all 12 Type 45s - an offer being evaluated by Sir Robert Walmesley, chief of defence procurement, and to be considered by ministers who are unlikely to act before June 7. BAE insiders insist their hand was forced because Jay and the Vosper board rejected an agreed structure, process and price for the contract and put in a higher, take-it-or-leave-it price. BAE says its offer represents greater value and, if the project comes in below the price, the savings will be shared with the exchequer. It has effectively told Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, and Sir Robert it wants to be sole builder of bigger, more complex warships while Vosper and its peers can design and build smaller craft. It has offered Vosper free rein to build naval ships below 85m - which it would then market abroad for the Southampton company. Vosper cried foul. Monopolists, they shouted. Its far bigger rival (and occasional joint venture partner), forced to issue a profits warning in January because of cost overruns and losses on other MoD contracts, was trying to solve its problems by coercing Whitehall into allowing it control of the warship market. The monopolist charge sticks, certainly with BAE's main competitors. \"Competition is something which is necessary, helpful and good for the customer; any restriction of markets is a disease,\" says one senior European defence executive. \"BAE Systems is telling the world it wants to be the monopoly supplier in the UK and demanding open access to the US, European and other markets.\" BAES's military-industrial-political power is such that even its bitterest rivals do deals with it, often afraid to take it on. Jay, fighting to retain warship building as a part of Vosper's business (albeit one that accounts for 30% of sales and profits) brushes aside the \"fear factor\" and ac cuses BAES of trying to hold the government to ransom. His reasoning is simple. BAES, via its merger with the then GEC's defence electronics division, inherited three shipyards - Barrow in Furness, and Govan and Scotstoun on the Clyde - and needs to invest \u00a3147m to bring them up to date. It has admitted that at least one of these is surplus to needs (probably Scotstoun) while Govan, empty of work, is losing \u00a33m a month or more. Jay claims BAE Marine can submit a lower price only because the mother group, as prime contractor, can recoup the losses further up the supply chain. It is not an argument that cuts much ice with BAES which denies it seeks a monopoly. Rather, it says, it wants a \"strategic restructuring\" of the warship industry that will bring an end to the cyclical nature of MoD work which in turn forces it to spread programmes around Britain's yards - often with disastrous results, as at Cammell Laird. \"It's a great opportunity to get some security into the industry, stop playing Russian roulette with people's jobs and improve our performance in export markets,\" say insiders. Its counter-argument is that its approach, by ensuring economies of scale, will bring greater value for money and make capital investment that much less risky. Jay, in turn, says forcibly that open competition - \"It's written into the very fabric of this company\" - will encourage innovation, cost control and greater productivity and his company has a track record in this regard. \"We've consistently been profitable; they're losing money,\" he says, prompting the reply from BAES: \"He doesn't want competition; he wants allocation - and taxpayers' funds to build the new yard for the destroyers in Portsmouth.\" So far, in this increasingly nasty dogfight, Vosper has gained the upper hand in terms of public support. Its case won't necessarily cut the mustard in Whitehall where senior insiders say: \"This is not just about Type 45s but the future direction of the warship construction industry in the UK, especially the production of highly complex ships such as carriers, frigates, destroyers and assault vessels.\" BAES, on the other hand, has too often overplayed its powerful hand and created enemies, not least among important ministers. The only certain outcome is that the ships will be British-built.",

For the foreseeable future they will be attempting to get out of the upholstered netherworld into which they have slipped down the back of a sofa. It's funny how some people earn a living. </p> <p>McColl and Foley are better known as The Right Size. Almost as soon as they began touring in the late 1980s, they earned a loyal following on the small-scale circuit. They were admired by the same people who enjoyed Theatre de Complicite and other physical-theatre shows. Even so, this pair of clowns seemed destined to spend the rest of their careers playing out their fantastical scenarios in provincial arts centres. </p> <p>Then, in 1997, they got stage designer Alice Power to build them a bathroom. Inspired by the experiences of Beirut hostages Brian Keenan and John McCarthy, Do You Come Here Often? was 75 minutes of absurdist comedy in which McColl and Foley, as the prattish David and spacey Kevin, were trapped for 25 years with only each other and a pastel-coloured bathroom suite for company. Suddenly McColl and Foley were being compared to Morecambe and Wise on the one hand, and Beckett's Vladimir and Estragon on the other. Over the next few years they conquered Edinburgh, the West End and Broadway. </p> <p>Now, after a long gap, they are back with a new show. Bewilderness is about two middle-aged men on a golfing holiday in Devon, who hear someone crying for help from down the back of a sofa. Unwisely, they decide to investigate. Before long, they find themselves trapped in a surreal betwixt-and-between world, where a man wearing a ruby slipper rides a bicycle, and somebody else is dressed up as a broom. McColl and Foley are sharing the stage with Freddie Jones, a longtime fan of The Right Size, who has worked for both Fellini and David Lynch. I bet he's never done anything quite as weird as Bewilderness. </p> <p>So why has it taken McColl and Foley so long to produce a follow-up to Do You Come Here Often? In fact, they have not been idle. They have made Brecht seem improbably jolly and entertaining while playing the lead roles in Lee Hall's version of Mr Puntilla and His Man Matti at the Traverse in Edinburgh and the Almeida in London. They have also spent time writing radio comedy. </p> <p>Foley likens what they have been doing to \"the old fallow field system. You crop a couple of fields and leave another untouched. Then, after a couple of years, you go to work on it again and see what grows there.\" </p> <p>This is quite a long speech for the laconic Foley. Meeting them you are struck by how much their stage personas reflect their real-life personalities. McColl, 39, is all pop-eyed enthusiasms; Foley, 36, is quiet and makes his points with well-timed gestures. In Bewilderness McColl's interpretation of the world down the back of the sofa as a benign wonderland is countered by Foley's dour rationalism. In a way the show is a metaphor for the experience of theatre itself: one person looks at the stage and sees a magical place, while another sees only a bare space with an actor walking across it. </p> <p>Like all The Right Size's shows, Bewilderness is a devised piece, which develops as it is performed - though McColl notes that \"although we always say that we do shows, not plays, this does have more of the feel of a play about it. The hardest thing with devised work is to find a structure that works. Over the years I've seen so many devised shows that have included brilliant bits but haven't worked as a whole. Working on Mr Puntilla and doing more writing has definitely influenced us.\" </p> <p>It has also influenced perceptions about the company. Just as Complicite began to be taken seriously by the mainstream only when it put on Shakespeare, so McColl and Foley feel that doing Brecht has given them a new credibility. \"It's the culture,\" says Foley. \"You don't get recognition for making people laugh and low comedy is what we do best.\" </p> <p>But they are selling themselves short. One of the best things about Do You Come Here Often? was that, though it was full of gags, Foley and McColl never looked as if they were trying to make you laugh. Rather, laughter was the best possible outcome in a scenario that could just as easily have led to tears. </p> <p>Similarly, in Bewilderness, the fine line between comedy and tragedy is expertly etched. Having seen the show, I now feel about the B1102 at Uttoxeter how I felt when I was 11 and read CS Lewis's final book in the Narnia chronicles and discovered what really happened to Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. Classic children's literature, including the Narnia books, The Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland, appears to be a strong, although perhaps unconscious, influence on Bewilderness. So does Dante's Inferno. </p> <p>So what, in the end, is the show about? \"I suppose it's about us. All our shows are about us,\" says McColl. \"It's about two men approaching middle age questioning what we have done, what is behind us and what is in front. It is about being at the midpoint of your life and stumbling off the road into the wood.\" </p> <p>\"We're always saying, 'That's it, that's our last show. We can't top that.'

      "bodyText": "Britain was singled out for criticism yesterday as members of the European parliament put the finishing touches to their controversial investigation into a global surveillance network run by the US. While the biggest target of next month's report is likely to be France - whose extensive network for electronic interception at home and abroad is not subject to any parliamentary supervision - Britain was accused by several MEPs of being untrustworthy in EU terms because of its relationship with the US. But sources in the temporary parliamentary committee set up to look into Echelon - a group whose creation was initially opposed by the British government - admitted last night that it will not be possible to prove definitively that the US uses economic espionage to help its firms win contracts as a matter of policy, though there are some isolated examples. Last year it was alleged that the US used Echelon to beat the European consortium Airbus on an aircraft deal with Saudi Arabia. Echelon, established during the cold war, is a network of listening posts reported to be capable of intercepting millions of telephone, fax and email messages. MEPs want to draw attention to hi-tech surveillance and its implications for privacy, and are expected to point out the need for proper regimes in EU states to oversee the use of such surveillance, committee sources said. France is considered a culprit. Britain has been wary because the surveillance and intelligence issue has been presented as one where a choice has to be made between loyalty to the US and to European partners - and also because intelligence and security matters are normally off-limits for consideration by the EU. An espionage expert, Nicky Hager - whose native New Zealand is part of the Echelon network - told the committeee yesterday that interception facilities at Morwenstow in Cornwall and Menwith Hill in Yorkshire were almost certainly used to spy on European targets. Mr Hager urged the committee to encourage greater public use of encryption techniques to guard their privacy. He also argued that Britain was in a uniquely sensitive position because of its EU membership and close US relations.\"It is only secrecy that allows the British government to maintain two incompatible positions at once,\" he said. Several MEPs insisted that Britain's relationship with the US meant that it could not be trusted by its EU partners. \"Britain has one leg in Europe and one in mid-Atlantic,\" said the committee's chairman, Gerhard Schmid, a German Social Democrat. \"If there are conflicts of interest between the EU and the US there could be potential conflict for the UK.\" Giuseppe Di Lello Finuoli, an Italian leftwinger, protested that Britain's GCHQ eavesdropping station in Cheltenham, which works with the US national security agency, had tested encryption equipment being used by the EU council of ministers, responsible for developing the union's fledgling rapid reaction force. Committee members visit Washington early next month for talks with senior intelligence figures before finalising their keenly awaited report. Earlier this year they saw Jack Straw, Britain's home secretary, but did not get the meeting they wanted with the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, who has ministerial responsibility for GCHQ and the Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. Britain has never denied helping the US operate Echelon listening posts and satellites, as do Canada, Australia and New Zealand under a long-term agreement. London's position is that any interception of communications carried out by GCHQ is covered by strict legal guidelines, ministerial control and parliamentary supervision. Only threats to the supply of energy, commodities and raw materials or attempts to manipulate or undermine financial markets would justify interception, the government says.",

Had it come from the former Soviet Union? And where was it heading next? By  <B>Ian Traynor</B> in Moscow and  <B>Steven Dudley</B> in Bogota.",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On a warm Friday afternoon last month, six Colombian secret policemen, along with members of the prosecutor general's office and various geologists, knocked on the door of Alfonso Sandoval. Although located in a posh western suburb of Bogota and close to the US embassy, Sandoval's house showed signs of ageing. The walls were coming apart and the paint was chipping.</p> <p>The agents had been closely following Sandoval for two months and believed they had gathered enough evidence to search for illegal substances in his home. The unassuming-looking Sandoval let in the agents who scoured the first and second floors. Just beyond the kitchen in a back room they found a computer, a spectrometer for measuring the purity of radioactive elements, and two lead canisters with 600 grams of highly concentrated uranium. The geologists' Geiger counters immediately showed heavy signs of radiation.</p> <p>The house was severely contaminated. The FBI was alerted. And Sandoval instantly fell under suspicion of being at the centre of a new and lethal international smuggling ring ultimately aimed at flogging a nuclear warhead, or the wherewithal to make one, to any unsavoury regime or dictator.</p> <p>Sandoval's uranium was not weapons-grade, at least not yet. But it was much more highly enriched than the material used in civilian nuclear energy generation and was roughly of the degree of enrichment used to fuel Russia's ageing fleet of nuclear submarines - around 66% pure. The Colombian authorities estimated the local market value of the 600 grams at just over \u00a31m.</p> <p>The files on Sandoval's computer revealed detailed information on uranium enrichment processes. The Colombian investigators believe that Sandoval was engaged, however implausibly, in a high-risk, home-grown uranium enrichment exercise.</p> <p>That scenario is scorned by the experts who point out that enriching uranium is an extraordinarily intensive and complex process. They add that Saddam Hussein, with limitless funds, has spent 10 years trying and failing to produce weapons-grade uranium using the rudimentary techniques employed by the US in the Manhattan Project in the 1940s.</p> <p>So what was Sandoval up to? And where did the uranium come from?</p> <p>Given the assumed links between Russian and Ukrainian mafias and Colombian drugs cartels, speculation about the origins of the nuclear pellets is focusing on the huge and chaotic nuclear industries of the former Soviet Union, although in the decade since the communist behemoth collapsed there has been only one significant confirmed case of weapons-grade fissile material being smuggled west and sold. Interestingly, that case also bore Colombian and Russian fingerprints. \"The uranium could be of Russian origin,\" says David Kyd, spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) in Vienna. \"But you would need detailed laboratory analysis and a number of days before you would be able to find a signature.\"</p> <p>Weapons-grade uranium is 95% enriched, while the stuff used in nuclear power stations is 2%-3% enriched. The 66% enrichment, says Kyd, is \"bizarre\".</p> <p>Given the corrupt and impoverished condition of the Russian nuclear and military industries, there is no doubt that through the past decade, Russian boffins have been selling the secrets of their arcane trade to the highest bidders, whether in Iraq, North Korea, or Libya, despite US aid programmes aimed at securing Russian scientists' salaries, safely disposing of weapons-grade uranium and plutonium, and de-nuclearising other parts of the former Soviet Union. Filching and smuggling of low-level radioactive materials, however, is rife in Russia.</p> <p>\"There have been repeated attempts to take radioactive metals to Finland this year,\" admits Dmitriy Kokko, an officer with the customs service in north-west Russia. \"Cases of smuggling or accidental export are taking place all the time.\"</p> <p>A St Petersburg conference two weeks ago was told that there had been 500 attempted cases of radioactive materials being smuggled out last year alone. But most of these cases entail relatively low-risk isotopes, metal being sold for scrap in the west, or materials stolen from medical laboratories. Innocent people may get sick from this, but it does not have the makings of a nuclear bomb.</p> <p>In a typical week earlier this month, a container of radioactive isotopes was stolen from an aluminium plant in Ukraine and offered for sale, while two sailors in Russia's Pacific fleet were arrested in Vladivostok after trying to sell parts taken from a naval nuclear installation.</p> <p>\"You can only get the highly enriched uranium and the plutonium at a few closed centres in Russia and we don't get reports of this being stolen,\" says Igor Kudrik, a Russian expert at the Bellona nuclear watchdog in Norway.</p> <p>\"But the situation is very serious. The Russians don't report thefts of fissile materials, but three or four times a year it emerges that someone has been arrested for stealing fissile materials. We're never told what happened to the material.\"</p> <p>Apart from not being of the required degree of enrichment to make a bomb, the Sandoval uranium stash was also very small - just over half a kilo - experts say you need 25 kilos to make a bomb.</p> <p>Nuclear weapons can be made from two types of radioactive material - enriched uranium and plutonium. Natural uranium contains two kinds of atoms, U-233 and a tiny amount of U-235, which is radioactive - that is, it decays, giving off energy and particles. Sometimes, the decaying U-235 atom will turn a U-233 atom into another U-235 atom. If the concentration of U-235 reaches a high enough level, it can produce new U-235 faster than it decays. If uranium is enriched so that U-235 reaches 2-3%, it can generate enough energy for nuclear power. If it reaches 95%, and there is enough uranium in the first place, there will be a nuclear explosion. Plutonium, which does not exist naturally, works in the same way, but with a different set of atoms.</p> <p>The most notorious case of nuclear smuggling from the former Soviet Union entailed plutonium. In 1994, a Colombian, Justitiano Torres Benitez, was arrested at Munich airport after arriving on a flight from Moscow carrying 340g of plutonium. Together with two Spanish middlemen, he was jailed in 1995. He got just under five years. He should be out by now.</p> <p>Yet that case illustrated all the ambiguities of the shadowy world of nuclear smuggling, with spies, counter-spies, journalists and double agents pursuing crooks, fraudsters, scientists, businessmen and buyers, with nobody sure what game is really being played.</p> <p>The nuclear material in Torres' case really did come from Russia. Alarming. But the buyer, and to many the instigator of the entire crooked sting, was the German state, in the form of the German Federal Intelligence Service. Had a German undercover agent not offered the men \u00a3170m for enough plutonium to make a bomb, the defence argued convincingly, the shipment would never have taken place.

      "bodyText": "On a warm Friday afternoon last month, six Colombian secret policemen, along with members of the prosecutor general's office and various geologists, knocked on the door of Alfonso Sandoval. Although located in a posh western suburb of Bogota and close to the US embassy, Sandoval's house showed signs of ageing. The walls were coming apart and the paint was chipping. The agents had been closely following Sandoval for two months and believed they had gathered enough evidence to search for illegal substances in his home. The unassuming-looking Sandoval let in the agents who scoured the first and second floors. Just beyond the kitchen in a back room they found a computer, a spectrometer for measuring the purity of radioactive elements, and two lead canisters with 600 grams of highly concentrated uranium. The geologists' Geiger counters immediately showed heavy signs of radiation. The house was severely contaminated. The FBI was alerted. And Sandoval instantly fell under suspicion of being at the centre of a new and lethal international smuggling ring ultimately aimed at flogging a nuclear warhead, or the wherewithal to make one, to any unsavoury regime or dictator. Sandoval's uranium was not weapons-grade, at least not yet. But it was much more highly enriched than the material used in civilian nuclear energy generation and was roughly of the degree of enrichment used to fuel Russia's ageing fleet of nuclear submarines - around 66% pure. The Colombian authorities estimated the local market value of the 600 grams at just over \u00a31m. The files on Sandoval's computer revealed detailed information on uranium enrichment processes. The Colombian investigators believe that Sandoval was engaged, however implausibly, in a high-risk, home-grown uranium enrichment exercise. That scenario is scorned by the experts who point out that enriching uranium is an extraordinarily intensive and complex process. They add that Saddam Hussein, with limitless funds, has spent 10 years trying and failing to produce weapons-grade uranium using the rudimentary techniques employed by the US in the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. So what was Sandoval up to? And where did the uranium come from? Given the assumed links between Russian and Ukrainian mafias and Colombian drugs cartels, speculation about the origins of the nuclear pellets is focusing on the huge and chaotic nuclear industries of the former Soviet Union, although in the decade since the communist behemoth collapsed there has been only one significant confirmed case of weapons-grade fissile material being smuggled west and sold. Interestingly, that case also bore Colombian and Russian fingerprints. \"The uranium could be of Russian origin,\" says David Kyd, spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) in Vienna. \"But you would need detailed laboratory analysis and a number of days before you would be able to find a signature.\" Weapons-grade uranium is 95% enriched, while the stuff used in nuclear power stations is 2%-3% enriched. The 66% enrichment, says Kyd, is \"bizarre\". Given the corrupt and impoverished condition of the Russian nuclear and military industries, there is no doubt that through the past decade, Russian boffins have been selling the secrets of their arcane trade to the highest bidders, whether in Iraq, North Korea, or Libya, despite US aid programmes aimed at securing Russian scientists' salaries, safely disposing of weapons-grade uranium and plutonium, and de-nuclearising other parts of the former Soviet Union. Filching and smuggling of low-level radioactive materials, however, is rife in Russia. \"There have been repeated attempts to take radioactive metals to Finland this year,\" admits Dmitriy Kokko, an officer with the customs service in north-west Russia. \"Cases of smuggling or accidental export are taking place all the time.\" A St Petersburg conference two weeks ago was told that there had been 500 attempted cases of radioactive materials being smuggled out last year alone. But most of these cases entail relatively low-risk isotopes, metal being sold for scrap in the west, or materials stolen from medical laboratories. Innocent people may get sick from this, but it does not have the makings of a nuclear bomb. In a typical week earlier this month, a container of radioactive isotopes was stolen from an aluminium plant in Ukraine and offered for sale, while two sailors in Russia's Pacific fleet were arrested in Vladivostok after trying to sell parts taken from a naval nuclear installation. \"You can only get the highly enriched uranium and the plutonium at a few closed centres in Russia and we don't get reports of this being stolen,\" says Igor Kudrik, a Russian expert at the Bellona nuclear watchdog in Norway. \"But the situation is very serious. The Russians don't report thefts of fissile materials, but three or four times a year it emerges that someone has been arrested for stealing fissile materials. We're never told what happened to the material.\" Apart from not being of the required degree of enrichment to make a bomb, the Sandoval uranium stash was also very small - just over half a kilo - experts say you need 25 kilos to make a bomb. Nuclear weapons can be made from two types of radioactive material - enriched uranium and plutonium. Natural uranium contains two kinds of atoms, U-233 and a tiny amount of U-235, which is radioactive - that is, it decays, giving off energy and particles. Sometimes, the decaying U-235 atom will turn a U-233 atom into another U-235 atom. If the concentration of U-235 reaches a high enough level, it can produce new U-235 faster than it decays. If uranium is enriched so that U-235 reaches 2-3%, it can generate enough energy for nuclear power. If it reaches 95%, and there is enough uranium in the first place, there will be a nuclear explosion. Plutonium, which does not exist naturally, works in the same way, but with a different set of atoms. The most notorious case of nuclear smuggling from the former Soviet Union entailed plutonium. In 1994, a Colombian, Justitiano Torres Benitez, was arrested at Munich airport after arriving on a flight from Moscow carrying 340g of plutonium. Together with two Spanish middlemen, he was jailed in 1995. He got just under five years. He should be out by now. Yet that case illustrated all the ambiguities of the shadowy world of nuclear smuggling, with spies, counter-spies, journalists and double agents pursuing crooks, fraudsters, scientists, businessmen and buyers, with nobody sure what game is really being played. The nuclear material in Torres' case really did come from Russia. Alarming. But the buyer, and to many the instigator of the entire crooked sting, was the German state, in the form of the German Federal Intelligence Service. Had a German undercover agent not offered the men \u00a3170m for enough plutonium to make a bomb, the defence argued convincingly, the shipment would never have taken place. The Germans were embarrassed. The Russian were incandescent. There has never been evidence to suggest that any of the nuclear warheads in the former Soviet bloc have gone missing or been sold off. Former Warsaw Pact countries such as Hungary or Poland never had control over the warheads on their territory, which have long since been withdrawn; Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus have all renounced the warheads on their territory, and these have, it seems, been accounted for and returned to Russia. That still leaves a grey area in Russia itself, where, behind their security screens, the 10 closed cities involved in nuclear weapons production have become hotbeds of entrepreneurship. No unauthorised visitors are supposed to go there. But they do. A few years ago Victor Osipov, director of a technology park in the closed plutonium-making city of Seversk, told the Guardian: \"There are 5,500 small businesses registered in the town - but only about 1,000 pay taxes. There's a strong core of entrepreneurs who would be capable of starting a whole nuclear industry from scratch.\" And a further part of the problem is that no one really knows how much bomb-grade material exists in Russia. For several years now the US department of energy has been funding a programme to track and trace all the uranium and plutonium across Russia. The result so far is inconclusive. The inventory is not complete, meaning it is harder to establish the facts if and when some of the stuff goes missing. And among the experts, the fear is now that the new and hard-nosed Bush administration in Washington will cut back on such aid programmes which, in any case, are humiliating to the Russian atomic lobby, once the Soviet elite. President Bill Clinton and his energy secretary, Bill Richardson, viewed the nuclear containment aid to Russia as a US national security priority. \"Under Spencer Abraham [Bush's new energy secretary] those programmes will be whittled back,\" says Kyd of the IAEA. Sandoval in his backyard bomb factory, meanwhile, seems an unlikely lynchpin of a new international syndicate trafficking in the nuclear nightmare. For a wannabe boffin with an atomic absorption spectrometer, he has no formal education and, at the time of the raid, he was recovering from open-heart surgery, though he has admitted to having spent time in Russia. He was also arrested in Spain in the early 1980s on charges of drug trafficking but released shortly after.

      "bodyText": "If you get caught between mooning and New York City, you are most likely somewhere in the Hamptons, though not the posh end obviously. In Bridgehampton, where \"new riche is better than no riche at all,\" the men simply don't get their bottoms out. And even if they did, no one would notice since they are too busy working the room (or more precisely, the marquee) and not paying attention to the polo matches. In Westhampton, it is a different story. There, the men flash their asses, wear big pink wigs and spray each other with squirty cream. And that's just the straight ones. This is Manhattan On The Beach (Channel 4), a place where all human life - well all human life that has decamped from New York - is on display. The Hamptons, which I always imagined to be a place of wooden verandahs, linen shirts, sea breezes and louche, Gatsby coolness, turns out to be a cross between a Club 18-30 holiday and All Bar One on a Saturday night. At one end of the spectrum, the poor people frequent all-day bars while baring their steroid-and silicon-enhanced bodies in the hope that someone as brainless as them will want to jump their bones (which, invariably, they do). In the middle, upwardly mobile professionals pay \u00a32,500 to spend every other weekend of the summer sharing a house with 40 other people.

      "body": "<p>Six decades ago, Tom Dobney, who has died aged 74, became the youngest military pilot in the world. In October 1940, stimulated by a dare from a fellow schoolboy at Nuneaton grammar school, the then 14-year-old falsified his birth certificate and enlisted in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. His form 543, or service record, advanced his date of birth from 1926 to 1922; his height, on enlistment, was registered as 5ft 5in. The speed at which he was growing might have, but didn't, raise eyebrows.</p> <p>The Battle of Britain had just ended, and Dobney, frantic to emulate the RAF pilots, had coerced his divorcee mother into assisting in the subterfuge. He was in uniform within a month and, in May 1941, six days past his 15th birthday, flew solo in a Tiger Moth trainer, after 12 flying hours, at Staverton, Gloucestershire. He earned his wings at training school in Medicine Hat, Alberta, and, back in Britain - after reportedly having met George VI in Bournemouth - he joined an operational training unit at Abingdon, the final step to a Whitley med- ium bomber squadron.</p> <p>Thus was the 15-year-old a pilot, with a crew of fully-grown young men. With the phasing-out of the Whitleys, however, he was switched to a unit in East Anglia, training Blenheim light bombers destined for the Middle East.</p> <p>Then came a call from his commanding officer. Dobney thought his application to fly fighters had materialised. Instead, he was reunited with his father, who, having met his mother by chance, had learned of their son's unorthodox entry into the RAF. Aghast, he had alerted the authorities, and the teenager was discharged immediately.</p> <p>But Dobney didn't give up easily. Later that year, he re-enlisted at a different recruiting centre - again saying he was 18 - and was given a new service number. This time, he had to wait nearly a year for the call-up, and within a month was rumbled. When, at last, he signed on correctly, there were no hard feelings. He was still a quali fied military pilot, but played no further part in the air war. By 1948, he was flying four-engined York transports on the Berlin airlift, and, after a spell with the Metropolitan police, returned to the RAF as a runway controller.</p> <p>Later, he became deputy art editor in the Manchester office of the Daily Express, retiring in 1986. His youthful adventures brought publicity - some of it unwelcome - although there were benefits, including an invitation to fly in the Battle of Britain Flight's only remaining Lancaster heavy bomber. He also earned an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's youngest qualified military pilot.</p> <p>Dobney leaves a widow, and six children from two previous marriages.</p> <p>\u0095 Tom Dobney, pilot, born May 6 1926; died April 3 2001</p>",

His form 543, or service record, advanced his date of birth from 1926 to 1922; his height, on enlistment, was registered as 5ft 5in. The speed at which he was growing might have, but didn't, raise eyebrows. The Battle of Britain had just ended, and Dobney, frantic to emulate the RAF pilots, had coerced his divorcee mother into assisting in the subterfuge. He was in uniform within a month and, in May 1941, six days past his 15th birthday, flew solo in a Tiger Moth trainer, after 12 flying hours, at Staverton, Gloucestershire. He earned his wings at training school in Medicine Hat, Alberta, and, back in Britain - after reportedly having met George VI in Bournemouth - he joined an operational training unit at Abingdon, the final step to a Whitley med- ium bomber squadron. Thus was the 15-year-old a pilot, with a crew of fully-grown young men. With the phasing-out of the Whitleys, however, he was switched to a unit in East Anglia, training Blenheim light bombers destined for the Middle East. Then came a call from his commanding officer. Dobney thought his application to fly fighters had materialised. Instead, he was reunited with his father, who, having met his mother by chance, had learned of their son's unorthodox entry into the RAF. Aghast, he had alerted the authorities, and the teenager was discharged immediately. But Dobney didn't give up easily. Later that year, he re-enlisted at a different recruiting centre - again saying he was 18 - and was given a new service number. This time, he had to wait nearly a year for the call-up, and within a month was rumbled. When, at last, he signed on correctly, there were no hard feelings. He was still a quali fied military pilot, but played no further part in the air war. By 1948, he was flying four-engined York transports on the Berlin airlift, and, after a spell with the Metropolitan police, returned to the RAF as a runway controller. Later, he became deputy art editor in the Manchester office of the Daily Express, retiring in 1986. His youthful adventures brought publicity - some of it unwelcome - although there were benefits, including an invitation to fly in the Battle of Britain Flight's only remaining Lancaster heavy bomber. He also earned an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's youngest qualified military pilot. Dobney leaves a widow, and six children from two previous marriages. \u0095 Tom Dobney, pilot, born May 6 1926; died April 3 2001",

Jane Andrews, who claims she acted in self-defence, tried to \"rig\" the crime scene to make it look as if she had been frightened of Thomas Cressman, a businessman, the prosecution claimed. And while she was on the run, the jury was told, she sent emotional text messages to friends claiming that she had left home hours before the murder, and that Mr Cressman was being blackmailed. The prosecution alleges that Andrews, 34, hit Mr Cressman, 39, with a cricket bat and then stabbed him through the chest with a 19cm kitchen knife. When his body was found in the blood spattered bedroom of their west London flat he was still holding the knife between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand, as if he had tried to pull it out. A pathologist said he believed the blade had been driven in to its full length. Bruce Houlder QC, prosecuting, said a bathrobe cord had been loosely tied from the outside of the bedroom door to a banister, as if to make the door secure - allegedly by Andrews trying to make it appear that she had been frightened. But a blood stained towel was found on the floor above, showing she had not been so frightened that she had fled the house immediately, he said. The court was also told of emotional notes left in the flat and highly charged messages she sent to family and friends after Mr Cressman's death. One of two notes in the flat read: \"My dearest parents, I am so sorry. No more hurt inside me any more.\" The second read: \"Tom hurt me so much.

It is not yet known what caused the blaze but Greater Manchester police described it as suspicious. Most guests were evacuated safely by hotel staff but a couple were found dead on the third floor and two people were injured and taken to hospital. Jeff Gill, of Greater Manchester fire brigade, said: \"The fire was contained to a section of the third floor corridor. Firefighters had to search 115 rooms to make sure that no one on their way out in the smoke and confusion had got lost.\" Guests were taken to two nearby hotels. They expressed surprise at the severity of the fire. A man who was staying on the fourth floor said: \"We were all outside believing it was nothing too serious. I saw a bit of smoke on my way out but didn't think it was a major fire.\" An investigation has been launched and hotel staff have been questioned by police and fire investigators to establish the cause of the blaze. \"It is a terrible tragedy and our deepest sympathies go out to the families involved,\" a spokesman for the hotel said. \"We plan to offer all the guests and our staff counselling to help them overcome the trauma of this event.\" Some of the evacuated guests were taken to the Pack Horse hotel a mile away. Rosa Lorens, 44, was staying at the Pack Horse when the evacuees arrived. \"They were in a state of shock,\" she said. \"No one knew what had caused the blaze and no one could believe that people had died.\"",

They claim thousands of people each year develop skin cancer because of the public's enduring love affair with sun-bathing. The Imperial Cancer Research Fund yesterday raised the stakes in its campaign highlighting the risks by calling on the beauty industry to help people decide that \"pale is beautiful\" and enlisting the support of a holiday company, JMC, to spread its \"sun sense\" message. The best way to make friends jealous about holidays, the charity said, was to send a postcard, not bring back a tan. Charity officials denied they were spoilsports, saying the incidence of skin cancer - the most common form of cancer in the United Kingdom - was increasing. Non-melanoma skin cancers are usually treatable but they claimed 467 lives in 1998. The more serious melanoma type killed 1,640 people the same year, and the number of cases each year is about three times that figure.

England's fourth largest city is a lively place with an exuberant student population\" Leicester \"[It] has suffered the triple disasters of wartime damage, uninspired post-war development and catastrophic industrial decline, but it has reacted to it better than most, reinventing itself as an environmentally progressive, ethnic entrept of a city that could teach other, bigger cities a thing or two about multiculturalism\" ...and the worst Around Glasgow \"Glasgow is surrounded by a grim hinterland of post-industrial communities ...

      "bodyText": "Susan Devonshire Jones admits that \"being married to a vicar does your head in\" (G2, April 20). She may have worse to come. My husband died just two years after he retired. As a clergy widow I have very little to show for 36 years in a working partnership. We moved six times in those years. There wasn't much opportunity to make close friends. After the vicarage, it is hard to adjust to a world where not even the neighbours are in the habit of \"dropping in\" - however much they are encouraged to do so. The final move diminished what little savings we had. From the clergy widow's pension of \u00a3553.34 a month, \u00a3219 is deducted for the mortgage on the Pensions Board's small bungalow in which I now live.

And however many staff there are, they all owe at least theoretical allegiance only to the company; that is, the boss. </p> <p>Tom Tierney, the former global chairman of Bain who left to set up Bridgespan, characterises consultancy work for such firms like this: \"The corporate chief executive has an enormous amount of power. As consultants, we come up with a dazzling and insightful programme. All the chief executive has to do is implement it and everybody applauds - he or she is a hero.\" </p> <p>He contrasts that set-up with the non-profit sector: a much more influential board, as well as donors who a chief executive cannot afford to neglect; plus volunteers who will not automatically jump to attention just because their chief executive says so. </p> <p>Tierney also points out the difficulty of measuring progress where there is not the single simple goal of showing a profit. </p> <p>\"In business the bottom line is clear, but in some mission-driven organisations it is not always clear what the final outcome is. The complexity of running even a small charity is quite a bit more challenging than running most businesses,\" he says. </p> <p>Bridgespan managing partner, Jeff Bradach, has studied the voluntary sector at Harvard university. He acknowledges the challenge for his firm, used to working with complex business problems but where the parameters are clear and there is usually ample data. </p> <p>He cites a housing charity, Habitat for Humanity, a past winner of a Guardian charity award for its work in Belfast, which has an approach to construction that he says would appal business managers if they did not appreciate that means are as important as ends for the organisation. </p> <p>\"The problems are really quite distinctive. It is easy to see how you could get into trouble by simply applying business methods to non-profit organisations,\" Bradach says. </p> <p>Reflecting on the firm's first year in the field, he says he's impressed by the level of skills evident in the first batch of non-profit clients: \"All of us have come away impressed by how much people in these organisations get done with so little resources.

Its vision is to \"bring the best leadership and management voices, with a focus on providing social sector organisations with the ideas and tools that enable them to better serve their customers and communities.\" </p> <p>That sounds a bit like teaching charities what management is all about, but Drucker knows more about management than most and is not as na\u00efve as that. He says: \"The 21st century will be the century of the social sector organisation. The leadership, competence and management of the social sector non-profit organisation will largely determine the values, the vision, the cohesion and the performance of society.\" </p> <p>The message is that businesses have as much to learn from voluntary sector managers as vice versa; a message which is just as applicable in the UK, according to Stephen Bubb, chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo). </p> <p>He cautions against the caricature contrast of big bad business and terribly nice charities. \"There's a mindset that thinks of charity as sweet and nice. It's a shock for some when they find there are lots of first-rate professional staff who could have been very successful in the private sector.\" </p> <p>While acknowledging that there are differences, Bubb argues that each can learn from the other. For example, he suggests charity managers are not always good at getting to grips with restructuring and other tough challenges which might involve redundancies and other difficult personnel issues. </p> <p>On the other hand, businesses are often struggling to come to terms with the fact that old-fashioned command and control does not normally yield brilliant results even in the commercial world. </p> <p>\"People often think in terms of what the private sector can bring to charities.

      "bodyText": "Owner occupation is cheaper than renting \"affordable\" homes from housing associations across much of the country, according to unpublished research. SocietyGuardian.co.uk has obtained a preview of Cambridge University research that identifies 55 areas where mortgage repayments cost less than renting from housing associations (see list). The research by the university's Dataspring unit for the Housing Corporation underlines why social landlords are suffering from chronic demand shortfall problems, which are threatening their financial viability. The research explains that while house prices may be rising, the actual cost of paying a mortgage has fallen, or increased by very little, because of low interest rates. At the same time the rise in housing association rents has been outstripping the rate of inflation, to allow associations to pay back private loans. This, together with low starting prices for houses in the north, means that in two entire regions owner occupation is as cheap or cheaper than social renting. The research compared housing association rent levels with the local cost of owning a house at the lower end of the market - based on lower quartile house prices. In the north-east, on average there is now no difference between the price of renting a two-bedroom housing association home and buying a two-bedroom home, in contrast to 1989-90 when social renting was 41% cheaper than buying. In Yorkshire and Humberside the difference is even more stark - in 1989-90 social renting was 61% cheaper, but a decade later it is actually 3% more expensive to rent a housing association home than pay off a mortgage. In 49 of the 55 districts, buying a home is more than 15% cheaper than renting from a housing association. An executive summary of the report has been published, but does not identify the 55 areas. It warns housing associations to take note of the figures to \"prevent high turnover and vacancy rates\". The research is highly sensitive for the housing association sector. Last year Dataspring found that buying was cheaper than renting in 25 areas. This finding was described as \"dynamite\" at the time, but the housing corporation refused to publish the figures because of a row about the methodology used. The new research, which shows the picture is now even bleaker, will be published in full as a discussion paper on the methodology for comparing social rents with the cost of home ownership. Professor Christine Whitehead, who supervised the project, said: \"Housing associations in these areas should be careful about what they are doing. And it's not just these area, people may be prepared to pay more to be an owner occupiers.\" But she warned that the figures should be treated with caution because the quality of cheaper homes to buy are not as good as housing association homes which are often newer and better maintained. The research comes at the start of a 10-year programme to reform social rents to a government formula based more closely on market values. Ms Whitehead argued that housing associations should examine the new research closely in the context of rent reform. She said: \"In many ways this type of market mechanism is more important than administrative rent restructuring.\" Dr Paul Hickman, senior research fellow in housing at Sheffield Hallam University, said: \"In many parts of the north, demand for social housing has been undermined by the relative affordability of home-ownership as many tenants, both actual and potential, have chosen to buy their own homes.\" He warned that the government's rent restructuring policy was too blunt an instrument to tackle low demand. He said: \"The clumsiness of the formula and its failure to recognise local factors may result in landlords adopting rent structures that are out of kilter with prevailing local house market conditions.\"",

      "trailText": "<p><strong>Profile:</strong> Fernley Calver, a youth worker making school fun for boys at risk of exclusion. By  Deborah Mulhearn</p>",
      "byline": "Deborah Mulhearn",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Sitting in on a Year 10 maths lesson wouldn't be many people's idea of fun, and normally it isn't Fernley Calver's. He is already kept busy running the Carroll Youth Centre in Winchester, where he does everything from scouring graffiti from the walls to chasing increasingly elusive funding. But he approached the local comprehensive, Kings', when he noticed a hard core of boys spending all their time in the centre because they had been excluded from school. </p> <p>The well-heeled Hampshire city is not the sort of place normally associated with alienated youth. Its schools are high up the league tables and unemployment and crime rates are low. But there are pockets of deprivation behind the comforting statistics and, for the relatively small number of young people who do not fit the mould, there are few safety nets. Life can quickly spiral from truancy to petty crime, or from being merely aimless to long-term jobless. </p> <p>\"Disillusionment and sense of failure is compounded by being surrounded by affluence,\" says Calver. </p> <p>The youth centre is on the Stanmore housing estate, the biggest council estate in Winchester, only a mile and a half from the city centre but a world away from the genteel cloisters of the famous cathedral and college. Calver knew that with a permanent exclusion on their records, the boys' job prospects would be poor; their disruptive behaviour and consequent low performance in national curriculum tests meant the school would be glad to see the back of them. </p> <p>Calver felt he could break the cycle of disruptive behaviour and poor achievement by using his youth centre experience to keep the boys better focused at school. \"I'm better placed than mentors or classroom assistants because I'm autonomous and they know this. I'm not employed by the education authority or the youth service, so I already have credibility with them - although it also means they can tell me to eff-off, which they do sometimes.\" </p> <p>The year head identifies participants for the inclusion scheme, who have to agree to take part, and targets are set. It is almost always maths lessons where Calver is needed. He meets the boys five minutes beforehand, then sits with them through the lesson, defusing potential confrontations, with a follow-up session later. \"It's not my agenda to improve exam results,\" he says. \"These are 14- and 15-year-old boys struggling with academia. A lot of the behaviour is driven by poor attention span and if I can keep them on an even keel, they can do some of the maths. One boy said I acted like a wall between him and the teacher and the other pupils.\" </p> <p>Calver, 40, left school at 16 with no qualifications and, until seven years ago, was a bricklayer. He became a trainee at the then new youth centre, while he studied for a degree in community and youth studies. A trip to Kenya in 1986, international youth year, to work in a charity school changed his outlook: \"Everyone has so much here. In Kenya, there were 5,000 applicants for 20 school places.\" </p> <p>Back in Winchester, Calver's inclusion project seems a crazy inversion of his work in Kenya. But he is succeeding - and the school is happy. Five of the six boys he has worked with have stayed in school for three terms; the sixth went to a special unit. He recognises the project has limitations. It is labour intensive and built on one-to-one relationships which, he admits, cannot easily be replicated. </p> <p>The youth centre was set up in 1993 with a bequest from two social worker sisters. Its \u00a325,000 annual funding from Hampshire youth service has now been cut to a share of a pot of \u00a36,000, spread among four full-time voluntary projects in the area. Revenue is generated from after-school clubs and community groups, but Calver is the only full-time paid worker. </p> <p>\"I can't spend too much time away from the youth centre, and I don't need the extra paperwork,\" he says. \"We're putting in a bid for European funding for another full-time worker who will spend half the time at the school and half at the youth centre.\" </p> <p>Calver believes his presence in a class benefits all the pupils, as well as improving the behaviour of the targeted children. \"Realistically, it's about them getting through their school life and teaching them that they have to be in a given place at a given time. If they can achieve this, they will stand a better chance in job interviews and then holding down the job, if they get it, and not getting into conflict with authority.\" </p> <p>After initial scepticism, he feels he has won the teachers round. \"Maybe they were uneasy about having me scribbling away at the back of the class. It has taken a while, but the teachers are now starting to ask for my opinion and advice.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sitting in on a Year 10 maths lesson wouldn't be many people's idea of fun, and normally it isn't Fernley Calver's. He is already kept busy running the Carroll Youth Centre in Winchester, where he does everything from scouring graffiti from the walls to chasing increasingly elusive funding. But he approached the local comprehensive, Kings', when he noticed a hard core of boys spending all their time in the centre because they had been excluded from school. The well-heeled Hampshire city is not the sort of place normally associated with alienated youth. Its schools are high up the league tables and unemployment and crime rates are low. But there are pockets of deprivation behind the comforting statistics and, for the relatively small number of young people who do not fit the mould, there are few safety nets. Life can quickly spiral from truancy to petty crime, or from being merely aimless to long-term jobless. \"Disillusionment and sense of failure is compounded by being surrounded by affluence,\" says Calver. The youth centre is on the Stanmore housing estate, the biggest council estate in Winchester, only a mile and a half from the city centre but a world away from the genteel cloisters of the famous cathedral and college. Calver knew that with a permanent exclusion on their records, the boys' job prospects would be poor; their disruptive behaviour and consequent low performance in national curriculum tests meant the school would be glad to see the back of them. Calver felt he could break the cycle of disruptive behaviour and poor achievement by using his youth centre experience to keep the boys better focused at school. \"I'm better placed than mentors or classroom assistants because I'm autonomous and they know this. I'm not employed by the education authority or the youth service, so I already have credibility with them - although it also means they can tell me to eff-off, which they do sometimes.\" The year head identifies participants for the inclusion scheme, who have to agree to take part, and targets are set. It is almost always maths lessons where Calver is needed. He meets the boys five minutes beforehand, then sits with them through the lesson, defusing potential confrontations, with a follow-up session later. \"It's not my agenda to improve exam results,\" he says. \"These are 14- and 15-year-old boys struggling with academia. A lot of the behaviour is driven by poor attention span and if I can keep them on an even keel, they can do some of the maths. One boy said I acted like a wall between him and the teacher and the other pupils.\" Calver, 40, left school at 16 with no qualifications and, until seven years ago, was a bricklayer. He became a trainee at the then new youth centre, while he studied for a degree in community and youth studies. A trip to Kenya in 1986, international youth year, to work in a charity school changed his outlook: \"Everyone has so much here. In Kenya, there were 5,000 applicants for 20 school places.\" Back in Winchester, Calver's inclusion project seems a crazy inversion of his work in Kenya. But he is succeeding - and the school is happy. Five of the six boys he has worked with have stayed in school for three terms; the sixth went to a special unit. He recognises the project has limitations. It is labour intensive and built on one-to-one relationships which, he admits, cannot easily be replicated. The youth centre was set up in 1993 with a bequest from two social worker sisters. Its \u00a325,000 annual funding from Hampshire youth service has now been cut to a share of a pot of \u00a36,000, spread among four full-time voluntary projects in the area. Revenue is generated from after-school clubs and community groups, but Calver is the only full-time paid worker. \"I can't spend too much time away from the youth centre, and I don't need the extra paperwork,\" he says. \"We're putting in a bid for European funding for another full-time worker who will spend half the time at the school and half at the youth centre.\" Calver believes his presence in a class benefits all the pupils, as well as improving the behaviour of the targeted children. \"Realistically, it's about them getting through their school life and teaching them that they have to be in a given place at a given time. If they can achieve this, they will stand a better chance in job interviews and then holding down the job, if they get it, and not getting into conflict with authority.\" After initial scepticism, he feels he has won the teachers round. \"Maybe they were uneasy about having me scribbling away at the back of the class. It has taken a while, but the teachers are now starting to ask for my opinion and advice.\"",

      "body": "<p>Talking over a personal problem is widely seen as a wise first step to restoring someone's sense of well-being. But for people who struggle to express their emotions, the pressure to tell others how they feel can add to their sense of failure. </p> <p>For teenagers, silence is a common tool for establishing independence from parents. It may also increase a young person's sense of isolation. Julia Mansfield, children and families manager of the north west-based charity After Adoption, recognised that adopted teenagers have problems speaking about their personal lives. So when she was approached by an artist wanting to work with young adoptees, she realised that painting might be a conduit for revealing their emotions. </p> <p>The result is Splat, the creative workshops run by artist Darren Bradshaw and After Adoption for adoptees aged 10 to 16. Six sessions have taken place in Salford since December; three are planned in Bolton. </p> <p>Ms Mansfield says: \"There was so little available for a number of adopted children who do not find words an easy way of communicating. Splat is a recognition that for youngsters who are adopted and who have difficulties, words are not a good medium - particularly in relation to youngsters whose placements have broken down.\" Although the charity runs more than 100 groups a year, including a young adoptees club, \"words are not the answer to everything\". </p> <p>After a social worker asked Ms Mansfield if any support services were available for a 12-year-old adoptee whose placement had broken down - \"He'd lost three families and I felt pretty grim about that\" - she called Mr Bradshaw, with whom she had already devised the idea behind Splat. They successfully bid for \u00a33,000 funding from Salford health and social services to run six workshops, with the support of Samantha Taylor, a post-adoption worker. </p> <p>Ms Mansfield argues that some issues \"predictably\" crop up for adoptees. These include feelings of loss (\"To be chosen you have to be rejected\"), difficulty in integrating (\"Life has been fractured. Adoption is a legalistic severence and reconnection\") and issues of loyalty towards their adopted family, which may conflict with a desire to search for their natural parents. </p> <p>Mr Bradshaw is adopted and says his background is a touchstone, allowing him to introduce the subject at the beginning of sessions. He tells the group that he is an adoptee as well as an artist, and shows them some of his work and childhood photographs of his adopted and natural family. </p> <p>\"The approach is fun and accessible,\" Mr Bradshaw says. The group use disposable cameras, clay and scrap material. \"They never choose to take pictures of their parents - it's always the cat, friends and their bedrooms. We don't get them in and say 'We're going to tackle adoption'. We chat informally. Adoption comes into the sessions from the beginning. I might be asked where I was born. Some may tell me they're thinking of searching for their natural parents.\" </p> <p>Many of the young people choose to focus on identity. \"We seem to do a lot of hand-prints and mother totems,\" Mr Bradshaw says. \"The idea is to unlock their creative potential. Underneath I can see there's a sense of alienation and low-self esteem. There's power in numbers. We're a group and we're overcoming shyness. It's not said. It's just happening.\" </p> <p>Mr Bradshaw, now 37, found his natural mother 10 years ago. He was adopted when he was a month old and counts himself lucky - his adoptive family were loving and supportive. His adoption was explained to him as soon as he was old enough to understand it. Until his mid-20s he used to fantasise about what his natural parents looked like, but did not feel compelled to find them. But a chance meeting with another adoptee changed his mind and for two years the idea of searching for them dominated his thoughts. </p> <p>Through the local adoption agency, he eventually found his natural grandmother's address in Eccles. \"I felt like a private detective. I went to the house and looked at passers-by, paying particular attention to women in their mid-50s, but was too scared to knock on the door.\" </p> <p>But when he eventually did, he knew that he was related to the woman who opened it. \"The eye contact was amazing. It was a gut feeling.\" </p> <p>His mother was 17 and his father 18 when he was born. \"My grandmother asked me if I was angry. I told her that I understood that it was a different time and that the pressure was intense.\" His grandmother phoned his mother, who lived 20 minutes away, and she immediately came to meet him. \"We stood in the middle of the room and ran our fingers through each other's hair. It was emotionally charged.\" </p> <p>Mr Bradshaw has two half-brothers and a half-sister. His father died in the mid-80s but he has developed relationships with other members of the family. </p> <p>The discovery dominated Mr Bradshaw's work. He made portraits and sculptures of his natural mother and at the same time began to attend a support group, run by After Adoption, for adoptees of all ages and at different stages in their search. Mr Bradshaw says he began to realise that he had low self-esteem. He kept in contact with the organisation for several years before Splat was formed. </p> <p>\"There's always a missing link. As a kid, I was always rooting around under the stairs, sure that something had been kept from me. At Splat we want to lessen the secrecy and create openness.\" </p> <p>Mr Bradshaw's story and Splat are featured in a BBC1 series, A Family of My Own. The programmes show 36 children, in care or permanent fostering, desperately seeking adoptive parents. The first series, which ran last year, caused a stir, with accusations that it was exploitative and would attract would-be parents seduced by the glamour of television. But social services and fostering and adoption agencies support the series. </p> <p>All prospective adoptive parents are vetted, and Planet 24, which makes the programme, takes great care to ensure that the children are not portrayed as being \"on sale\", while realising that media publicity to find adoptive parents for 10,000 children is crucial. The first series prompted 25,000 requests and up to half of the children featured were either placed or in the process of finding a family. </p> <p>But, as Splat shows, placing a child is often only the first step in healing deep-rooted feelings of rejection and isolation. </p> <p>Snippets of Splat's comment book are testament to the enthusiasm for the group.

      "bodyText": "Talking over a personal problem is widely seen as a wise first step to restoring someone's sense of well-being. But for people who struggle to express their emotions, the pressure to tell others how they feel can add to their sense of failure. For teenagers, silence is a common tool for establishing independence from parents. It may also increase a young person's sense of isolation. Julia Mansfield, children and families manager of the north west-based charity After Adoption, recognised that adopted teenagers have problems speaking about their personal lives. So when she was approached by an artist wanting to work with young adoptees, she realised that painting might be a conduit for revealing their emotions. The result is Splat, the creative workshops run by artist Darren Bradshaw and After Adoption for adoptees aged 10 to 16. Six sessions have taken place in Salford since December; three are planned in Bolton. Ms Mansfield says: \"There was so little available for a number of adopted children who do not find words an easy way of communicating. Splat is a recognition that for youngsters who are adopted and who have difficulties, words are not a good medium - particularly in relation to youngsters whose placements have broken down.\" Although the charity runs more than 100 groups a year, including a young adoptees club, \"words are not the answer to everything\". After a social worker asked Ms Mansfield if any support services were available for a 12-year-old adoptee whose placement had broken down - \"He'd lost three families and I felt pretty grim about that\" - she called Mr Bradshaw, with whom she had already devised the idea behind Splat. They successfully bid for \u00a33,000 funding from Salford health and social services to run six workshops, with the support of Samantha Taylor, a post-adoption worker. Ms Mansfield argues that some issues \"predictably\" crop up for adoptees. These include feelings of loss (\"To be chosen you have to be rejected\"), difficulty in integrating (\"Life has been fractured. Adoption is a legalistic severence and reconnection\") and issues of loyalty towards their adopted family, which may conflict with a desire to search for their natural parents. Mr Bradshaw is adopted and says his background is a touchstone, allowing him to introduce the subject at the beginning of sessions. He tells the group that he is an adoptee as well as an artist, and shows them some of his work and childhood photographs of his adopted and natural family. \"The approach is fun and accessible,\" Mr Bradshaw says. The group use disposable cameras, clay and scrap material. \"They never choose to take pictures of their parents - it's always the cat, friends and their bedrooms. We don't get them in and say 'We're going to tackle adoption'. We chat informally. Adoption comes into the sessions from the beginning. I might be asked where I was born. Some may tell me they're thinking of searching for their natural parents.\" Many of the young people choose to focus on identity. \"We seem to do a lot of hand-prints and mother totems,\" Mr Bradshaw says. \"The idea is to unlock their creative potential. Underneath I can see there's a sense of alienation and low-self esteem. There's power in numbers. We're a group and we're overcoming shyness. It's not said. It's just happening.\" Mr Bradshaw, now 37, found his natural mother 10 years ago. He was adopted when he was a month old and counts himself lucky - his adoptive family were loving and supportive. His adoption was explained to him as soon as he was old enough to understand it. Until his mid-20s he used to fantasise about what his natural parents looked like, but did not feel compelled to find them. But a chance meeting with another adoptee changed his mind and for two years the idea of searching for them dominated his thoughts. Through the local adoption agency, he eventually found his natural grandmother's address in Eccles. \"I felt like a private detective. I went to the house and looked at passers-by, paying particular attention to women in their mid-50s, but was too scared to knock on the door.\" But when he eventually did, he knew that he was related to the woman who opened it. \"The eye contact was amazing. It was a gut feeling.\" His mother was 17 and his father 18 when he was born. \"My grandmother asked me if I was angry. I told her that I understood that it was a different time and that the pressure was intense.\" His grandmother phoned his mother, who lived 20 minutes away, and she immediately came to meet him. \"We stood in the middle of the room and ran our fingers through each other's hair. It was emotionally charged.\" Mr Bradshaw has two half-brothers and a half-sister. His father died in the mid-80s but he has developed relationships with other members of the family. The discovery dominated Mr Bradshaw's work. He made portraits and sculptures of his natural mother and at the same time began to attend a support group, run by After Adoption, for adoptees of all ages and at different stages in their search. Mr Bradshaw says he began to realise that he had low self-esteem. He kept in contact with the organisation for several years before Splat was formed. \"There's always a missing link. As a kid, I was always rooting around under the stairs, sure that something had been kept from me. At Splat we want to lessen the secrecy and create openness.\" Mr Bradshaw's story and Splat are featured in a BBC1 series, A Family of My Own. The programmes show 36 children, in care or permanent fostering, desperately seeking adoptive parents. The first series, which ran last year, caused a stir, with accusations that it was exploitative and would attract would-be parents seduced by the glamour of television. But social services and fostering and adoption agencies support the series. All prospective adoptive parents are vetted, and Planet 24, which makes the programme, takes great care to ensure that the children are not portrayed as being \"on sale\", while realising that media publicity to find adoptive parents for 10,000 children is crucial. The first series prompted 25,000 requests and up to half of the children featured were either placed or in the process of finding a family. But, as Splat shows, placing a child is often only the first step in healing deep-rooted feelings of rejection and isolation. Snippets of Splat's comment book are testament to the enthusiasm for the group. One adoptive mother of a 13-year-old boy says he is \"the kind of child who's hard to get involved\" and, consequently, she is always on the look-out for ways to help him mix. The boy does not find it easy to make and keep friends. His early life was full of disruption. He is not very successful at school. \"But he's creating things. He's very excited about that.

      "body": "<p>The latest crisis in the farm-to-fork industry has brought added burdens for local authorities, with their environmental health and trading standards officers in the front line. These local government investigators - who have been on the trail first of BSE-infected meat, then of the sources of E.coli - now find themselves playing a key role in the battle against foot and mouth disease. </p> <p>But some hard-pressed councils, tired of having to juggle budgets to meet the ever-growing demands on their food safety officers, are warning that the government must stump up more resources to protect public health - or pay the penalty. </p> <p>It cost North Yorkshire county council \u00a330,000 when it was pushed by the government to bring the first and only prosecution in England against a restaurant for serving beef on the bone in defiance of a ban. The case collapsed, and the council's request for help with legal costs was ignored by ministers. </p> <p>What has since angered North Yorkshire is the government's decision to set up the food standards agency (FSA) with a \u00a3120m annual budget, equivalent to the entire cost of local government food enforcement. The authority argues that the new watchdog has caused extra work - with no additional funds to pay for it. </p> <p>This year, the authority's trading standards department asked the council for an extra \u00a3220,000 but was given only \u00a356,000 because of budget pressures. The council's director of business and consumer services, Gordon Gresty, says: \"The answer is not to continually set up organisations to oversee our work, but to provide sufficient resources for frontline staff.\" </p> <p>The FSA's request that local councils step up checks, to ensure that no imported beef sold should be from cattle under 30 months at the time of slaughter, illustrates the point. </p> <p>\"The FSA omitted to say how it expected local officers to check that a piece of beef came from an animal that was either under, or over, 30 months,\" says Gresty. \"Enforcement officers will tell you there is no way of checking. When this was drawn to the attention of the FSA, they said 'Check the paperwork', but foreign paperwork doesn't state the age of cattle. I support the agency and its values, but if it demands of our officers extra work then there must be extra resources.\" </p> <p>It took a four-year investigation by Rotherham council staff to reveal a nationwide racket, passing off condemned meat as fit for human consumption. Environmental health officers, working with police, discovered that at least 1,500 tonnes of condemned chicken and turkey had been laundered into the commercial food chain and served to schoolchildren and the elderly in residential homes.

      "bodyText": "The latest crisis in the farm-to-fork industry has brought added burdens for local authorities, with their environmental health and trading standards officers in the front line. These local government investigators - who have been on the trail first of BSE-infected meat, then of the sources of E.coli - now find themselves playing a key role in the battle against foot and mouth disease. But some hard-pressed councils, tired of having to juggle budgets to meet the ever-growing demands on their food safety officers, are warning that the government must stump up more resources to protect public health - or pay the penalty. It cost North Yorkshire county council \u00a330,000 when it was pushed by the government to bring the first and only prosecution in England against a restaurant for serving beef on the bone in defiance of a ban. The case collapsed, and the council's request for help with legal costs was ignored by ministers. What has since angered North Yorkshire is the government's decision to set up the food standards agency (FSA) with a \u00a3120m annual budget, equivalent to the entire cost of local government food enforcement. The authority argues that the new watchdog has caused extra work - with no additional funds to pay for it. This year, the authority's trading standards department asked the council for an extra \u00a3220,000 but was given only \u00a356,000 because of budget pressures. The council's director of business and consumer services, Gordon Gresty, says: \"The answer is not to continually set up organisations to oversee our work, but to provide sufficient resources for frontline staff.\" The FSA's request that local councils step up checks, to ensure that no imported beef sold should be from cattle under 30 months at the time of slaughter, illustrates the point. \"The FSA omitted to say how it expected local officers to check that a piece of beef came from an animal that was either under, or over, 30 months,\" says Gresty. \"Enforcement officers will tell you there is no way of checking. When this was drawn to the attention of the FSA, they said 'Check the paperwork', but foreign paperwork doesn't state the age of cattle. I support the agency and its values, but if it demands of our officers extra work then there must be extra resources.\" It took a four-year investigation by Rotherham council staff to reveal a nationwide racket, passing off condemned meat as fit for human consumption. Environmental health officers, working with police, discovered that at least 1,500 tonnes of condemned chicken and turkey had been laundered into the commercial food chain and served to schoolchildren and the elderly in residential homes. The unfit poultry meat, designated as pet food, had also been sold in restaurants and takeaways, and had found its way into supermarkets. It produced an estimated profit of \u00a32.5m for the syndicate behind the scam. The gang was stopped only by the dedication of three young environmental health officers who had instigated the investigation, conducted partly in their own free time. Another 50 council clerical staff worked shifts and weekends to photocopy, reference and catalogue about 500,000 documents seized in the investigation. When five defendants were jailed at Hull crown court in December last year, Judge Peter Heppel commended the Rotherham environmental health officers, and the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH) praised them for their \"commitment and professionalism\". South Yorkshire police, which had brought its expertise to the investigation one year after it had begun, said that the local authority had \"done a marvellous job in collating documents and exhibits\". Praise indeed - but fine words pay no bills. Rotherham council found itself left with a debt of \u00a3500,000 for the four-year investigation.

It conveyed a sense of compassion and hope. Her smile was saying to me: \"Sorry this is bad news. But don't worry - all is not lost.\" </p> <p>The subtle messages signalled by my doctor's non-verbal behaviour are firmly lodged in my memory - as they are for many patients or relatives given shocking or bad news. But ask clinicians about the first time they told a patient he or she had cancer, a man that his wife was brain damaged from an accident or a new mother that her child was diagnosed with Down's syndrome, and the memory might be hazy. </p> <p>And not unreasonably; after all it is part of the job to regularly break bad news. Yet formal training for doctors and nurses on how to disclose distressing news to patients or relatives is markedly inconspicuous. In fact, it is often a lowly\"special request\" or appendage on clinical undergraduate and postgraduate training. </p> <p>While most professionals develop their own appropriate techniques for breaking such news, they can be inadequate. Some methods, as patients have pointed out time and time again, are horrendously crass. Studies in the child disability field reveal that about 50% of parents are dissatisfied with the way news of their son's or daughter's disability was given to them. </p> <p>This can have detrimental consequences for parents' subsequent relationships not only with medical professionals but with their own child. \"If news of a disability is portrayed negatively by a doctor, it can affect the bonding of parents to their child and particularly their view of disability later in life,\" says Robina Shah, a clinical psychologist working at St Mary's hospital, Manchester. </p> <p>In its own effort to address these training inadequacies St Mary's has offered, over the last three years, a \"sharing the news\" workshop to clinicians and nurses. The participatory workshop, developed by Shah, aims to refine professionals' communication skills when delivering distressing news. </p> <p>By focusing on the patients' perspective, it allows professionals - perhaps for the first time in their career - to devote a whole day to reflection on the details of how they break unpleasant news. </p> <p>In what room should they meet patients and relatives? Should they sit or stand? How much or how little should be imparted? How much medical jargon should be used? What is the best tone of voice to use? </p> <p>General rules about good eye contact, sensitivity and honesty are paramount - as is checking that pagers are switched off and that correct names are used. And even though consultation time is limited, doctors are encouraged to allow patients or relatives the feeling that they have their unwavering attention. </p> <p>Shah says: \"The training offers professionals the time and space to ask themselves the question: 'Can I do this better?' It offers them the opportunity to share models of good practice.\" </p> <p>The Royal College of Physicians, which has accredited Shah's course, recognises there is a lack of adequate training in communication skills and urges that training be made \"high priority\" in formal medical education. </p> <p>All the more reason, one might expect, for professionals to welcome the opportunity to sign up to such courses. Some doctors, nevertheless, remain sceptical of being formally taught how to communicate. They insist that \"hands-on\" experience remains by far the most effective source of learning. </p> <p>Charles Essex, consultant neurodevelopmental paediatrician at the Gulson clinic, Coventry, is convinced that being in the same room as a senior colleague, and watching as they disclose distressing news, is the key to self-improvement. </p> <p>\"I would not have learnt how to break news if I had not been with my senior colleagues and seen them do it,\" he says. \"It is like training to be an astronaut - you cannot do it until you have been with other astronauts. And it is during peer reviews that you learn what works for other consul tants, and how one particular way of saying something is perhaps better than another. Reflecting on what you do and say is quite right; but this is something I do the whole time.\" </p> <p>Essex, who regularly has to tell parents of their child's disability, or even that the child may not survive long, accepts \"there is a place\" for courses such as Shah's. But he says he \"probably would not go on one\". </p> <p>Aware that this hardened attitude risks others dubbing him as old fashioned, Essex adds that it is a question of crude reality: bad news is bad news and cannot be dressed as anything else. \"I often give parents their worst nightmares, and no one will ever say: 'Thank you doctor.' If I say to parents that their child is going to die, or has autism, they should be angry or sad - if not, I have to question whether they have really heard what I said.\" </p> <p>It is such understandably distressing reactions by parents, Essex argues, that help explain statistics supposedly showing that relatives are dissatisfied with how bad news is broken to them. </p> <p>Nevertheless, other professionals who have attended Shah's workshop believe her approach does have place on the learning curve - particularly because peers cannot always be relied upon to give adequate guidance. Ian Dady, a consultant neonatal paediatrician, says: \"It is difficult for one doctor to advise or correct colleagues. There is an awful lot to remember when disclosing bad news and it can be beneficial to refine your skills.\" </p> <p>In addition, Shah explains, not all doctors have had exemplary peer role models to follow. \"They might never have had the opportunity to unlearn inappropriate things they picked up,\" she says. </p> <p>With the government emphasising clinical governance and lifelong learning, demands to improve professionals' communication skills are likely to come from the top. </p> <p>\"There will always be doctors who deliver news badly, and patients' complaints will reveal this,\" says Shah. \"This will always be something we have to work on.

      "body": "<p>Charityfair, the key annual event for the voluntary sector, this week celebrates its 10th anniversary with more than 180 events for people working and volunteering in the voluntary sector - or thinking of doing so. The sector is big business these days, so much so that the world's leading management consultants want a piece of the action. </p> <p>Both McKinsey and Bain - US-based global consultancies which are leaders in giving strategy advice to multinationals - have recently moved to address what they like to call the non-profit sector. </p> <p>McKinsey has set up a team to serve non-profit customers - though they'll still be charged fees. Bain has established a separate but associated firm in the US, called Bridgespan, and wants this to be a model for other \"professional service\" firms to follow around the world. </p> <p>These organisations believe they can help charities be more effective by applying the traditional analytical and strategic techniques which help the world's leading businesses decide how best to make money. </p> <p>But they have discovered it is not as simple as that. The companies they work for are relatively simple. Multinationals such as Unilever, Shell or IBM may be huge, with a global network of offices and relationships. And their activities embrace many products, processes and markets. But their overriding objective is simple - making money. </p> <p>Power structures in business are also relatively straightforward, even if it doesn't seem like that to somebody stuck in the middle of a corporate hierarchy. Essentially, however, the chief executive reports to a board which is normally quite remote and uninvolved. And however many staff there are, they all owe at least theoretical allegiance only to the company; that is, the boss. </p> <p>Tom Tierney, the former global chairman of Bain who left to set up Bridgespan, characterises consultancy work for such firms like this: \"The corporate chief executive has an enormous amount of power. As consultants, we come up with a dazzling and insightful programme. All the chief executive has to do is implement it and everybody applauds - he or she is a hero.\" </p> <p>He contrasts that set-up with the non-profit sector: a much more influential board, as well as donors who a chief executive cannot afford to neglect; plus volunteers who will not automatically jump to attention just because their chief executive says so. </p> <p>Tierney also points out the difficulty of measuring progress where there is not the single simple goal of showing a profit. </p> <p>\"In business the bottom line is clear, but in some mission-driven organisations it is not always clear what the final outcome is. The complexity of running even a small charity is quite a bit more challenging than running most businesses,\" he says. </p> <p>Bridgespan managing partner, Jeff Bradach, has studied the voluntary sector at Harvard university. He acknowledges the challenge for his firm, used to working with complex business problems but where the parameters are clear and there is usually ample data. </p> <p>He cites a housing charity, Habitat for Humanity, a past winner of a Guardian charity award for its work in Belfast, which has an approach to construction that he says would appal business managers if they did not appreciate that means are as important as ends for the organisation. </p> <p>\"The problems are really quite distinctive. It is easy to see how you could get into trouble by simply applying business methods to non-profit organisations,\" Bradach says. </p> <p>Reflecting on the firm's first year in the field, he says he's impressed by the level of skills evident in the first batch of non-profit clients: \"All of us have come away impressed by how much people in these organisations get done with so little resources. The entrepreneurialism and resourcefulness is truly remarkable. We stand in awe, frankly.\" These are not only the conclusions of US consultants, although the American appetite for management consultants and gurus does mean their ideas are being widely disseminated there. </p> <p>For example, business management expert Peter Drucker has set up a \"Foundation for non-profit management\". Its vision is to \"bring the best leadership and management voices, with a focus on providing social sector organisations with the ideas and tools that enable them to better serve their customers and communities.\" </p> <p>That sounds a bit like teaching charities what management is all about, but Drucker knows more about management than most and is not as na\u00efve as that. He says: \"The 21st century will be the century of the social sector organisation. The leadership, competence and management of the social sector non-profit organisation will largely determine the values, the vision, the cohesion and the performance of society.\" </p> <p>The message is that businesses have as much to learn from voluntary sector managers as vice versa; a message which is just as applicable in the UK, according to Stephen Bubb, chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo). </p> <p>He cautions against the caricature contrast of big bad business and terribly nice charities. \"There's a mindset that thinks of charity as sweet and nice. It's a shock for some when they find there are lots of first-rate professional staff who could have been very successful in the private sector.\" </p> <p>While acknowledging that there are differences, Bubb argues that each can learn from the other. For example, he suggests charity managers are not always good at getting to grips with restructuring and other tough challenges which might involve redundancies and other difficult personnel issues. </p> <p>On the other hand, businesses are often struggling to come to terms with the fact that old-fashioned command and control does not normally yield brilliant results even in the commercial world. </p> <p>\"People often think in terms of what the private sector can bring to charities. But there is a hell of a lot of good leadership practice in the voluntary sector which businesses want to learn about. They want to learn about motivation and inspiration - the softer skills that commercial people are often bloody poor at.\" </p> <p>Voluntary sector managers often have to lead volunteers. \"They don't have contracts of employment. You have to use a lot of skills which commercial leaders would be better for having.\" </p> <p>That is just one instance of the complexity of life in the not-for-profit sector, which the commercial world wants to influence as well as learn from. And of course there is a lot less money around. </p> <p>That doesn't stop executives abandoning the financial rewards of corporate life in search of a more fulfilling role in the voluntary sector. David Earnshaw, a former lobbyist with the drug company SmithKline (now GlaxoSmithKline) who has turned gamekeeper as head of Oxfam's campaign in Europe to sell Aids drugs at affordable prices in Africa is the latest example of this. </p> <p>Many like him have suffered culture shock after such a transfer. Elaine Smethurst of the training organisation Working for Charity, who yesterday presented a Charityfair workshop on transferring skills to the voluntary sector, says some business people have no understanding of the cultural differences. \"Bulls in china shops spring to mind,\" she says. </p> <p>But her experience is that size matters more than the type of organisation. Managers with big company experience struggle with the varied demands of smaller organisations, whether businesses or charities. </p> <p>On the other hand, middle managers from medium-sized businesses are just as likely to succeed as civil servants. And they will know how to deal with the management consultants when they come calling. </p> <p>For full coverage of Charityfair 2001 see <a href=\"http://www.societytheguardian.com/voluntary\">www.societytheguardian.com/voluntary</a> </p> <p>Charityfair 2001 started yesterday and continues today and tomorrow at the Business Design Centre in Islington, north London.

Bain has established a separate but associated firm in the US, called Bridgespan, and wants this to be a model for other \"professional service\" firms to follow around the world. These organisations believe they can help charities be more effective by applying the traditional analytical and strategic techniques which help the world's leading businesses decide how best to make money. But they have discovered it is not as simple as that. The companies they work for are relatively simple. Multinationals such as Unilever, Shell or IBM may be huge, with a global network of offices and relationships. And their activities embrace many products, processes and markets. But their overriding objective is simple - making money. Power structures in business are also relatively straightforward, even if it doesn't seem like that to somebody stuck in the middle of a corporate hierarchy. Essentially, however, the chief executive reports to a board which is normally quite remote and uninvolved. And however many staff there are, they all owe at least theoretical allegiance only to the company; that is, the boss. Tom Tierney, the former global chairman of Bain who left to set up Bridgespan, characterises consultancy work for such firms like this: \"The corporate chief executive has an enormous amount of power. As consultants, we come up with a dazzling and insightful programme. All the chief executive has to do is implement it and everybody applauds - he or she is a hero.\" He contrasts that set-up with the non-profit sector: a much more influential board, as well as donors who a chief executive cannot afford to neglect; plus volunteers who will not automatically jump to attention just because their chief executive says so. Tierney also points out the difficulty of measuring progress where there is not the single simple goal of showing a profit. \"In business the bottom line is clear, but in some mission-driven organisations it is not always clear what the final outcome is. The complexity of running even a small charity is quite a bit more challenging than running most businesses,\" he says. Bridgespan managing partner, Jeff Bradach, has studied the voluntary sector at Harvard university. He acknowledges the challenge for his firm, used to working with complex business problems but where the parameters are clear and there is usually ample data. He cites a housing charity, Habitat for Humanity, a past winner of a Guardian charity award for its work in Belfast, which has an approach to construction that he says would appal business managers if they did not appreciate that means are as important as ends for the organisation. \"The problems are really quite distinctive. It is easy to see how you could get into trouble by simply applying business methods to non-profit organisations,\" Bradach says. Reflecting on the firm's first year in the field, he says he's impressed by the level of skills evident in the first batch of non-profit clients: \"All of us have come away impressed by how much people in these organisations get done with so little resources. The entrepreneurialism and resourcefulness is truly remarkable. We stand in awe, frankly.\" These are not only the conclusions of US consultants, although the American appetite for management consultants and gurus does mean their ideas are being widely disseminated there. For example, business management expert Peter Drucker has set up a \"Foundation for non-profit management\". Its vision is to \"bring the best leadership and management voices, with a focus on providing social sector organisations with the ideas and tools that enable them to better serve their customers and communities.\" That sounds a bit like teaching charities what management is all about, but Drucker knows more about management than most and is not as na\u00efve as that. He says: \"The 21st century will be the century of the social sector organisation. The leadership, competence and management of the social sector non-profit organisation will largely determine the values, the vision, the cohesion and the performance of society.\" The message is that businesses have as much to learn from voluntary sector managers as vice versa; a message which is just as applicable in the UK, according to Stephen Bubb, chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo). He cautions against the caricature contrast of big bad business and terribly nice charities. \"There's a mindset that thinks of charity as sweet and nice. It's a shock for some when they find there are lots of first-rate professional staff who could have been very successful in the private sector.\" While acknowledging that there are differences, Bubb argues that each can learn from the other. For example, he suggests charity managers are not always good at getting to grips with restructuring and other tough challenges which might involve redundancies and other difficult personnel issues. On the other hand, businesses are often struggling to come to terms with the fact that old-fashioned command and control does not normally yield brilliant results even in the commercial world. \"People often think in terms of what the private sector can bring to charities. But there is a hell of a lot of good leadership practice in the voluntary sector which businesses want to learn about. They want to learn about motivation and inspiration - the softer skills that commercial people are often bloody poor at.\" Voluntary sector managers often have to lead volunteers. \"They don't have contracts of employment. You have to use a lot of skills which commercial leaders would be better for having.\" That is just one instance of the complexity of life in the not-for-profit sector, which the commercial world wants to influence as well as learn from. And of course there is a lot less money around. That doesn't stop executives abandoning the financial rewards of corporate life in search of a more fulfilling role in the voluntary sector. David Earnshaw, a former lobbyist with the drug company SmithKline (now GlaxoSmithKline) who has turned gamekeeper as head of Oxfam's campaign in Europe to sell Aids drugs at affordable prices in Africa is the latest example of this. Many like him have suffered culture shock after such a transfer. Elaine Smethurst of the training organisation Working for Charity, who yesterday presented a Charityfair workshop on transferring skills to the voluntary sector, says some business people have no understanding of the cultural differences. \"Bulls in china shops spring to mind,\" she says. But her experience is that size matters more than the type of organisation. Managers with big company experience struggle with the varied demands of smaller organisations, whether businesses or charities. On the other hand, middle managers from medium-sized businesses are just as likely to succeed as civil servants. And they will know how to deal with the management consultants when they come calling.

Not by yuppie property developers, but by the Manchester Environmental Resource Centre Initiative (Merci), whose intention is \"to create a focus and a tool for a sustainable and equitable model of regeneration\". </p> <p>In 1997, after several years of activism against roads, airports and GM foods, Cath Miller, Jane Pickering, Chris Walsh and Helen Woodcock decided protesting wasn't enough. \"Boundaries are being pushed by direct action groups like Earth First and Greenpeace, but the vacuum between the sparse ungreen reality of everyday life and the ideas of the most advanced green thinkers is being filled by Shell oil and their solar panels. The 'alternatives' of these corporations do nothing to improve the quality of life for the most under-resourced communities,\" says Walsh. </p> <p>In Merci's thinking, people and the environment, equity and sustainability are inseparably bound together - for them the importance of Bridge-5 Mill's location is its closeness to two communities - the Cardroom and the Ridgeway estates - and its history as the old Ancoats Lads Club. </p> <p>The idea of an environmental resource centre which would bring together eco-protesters, local people, and even some suits from Manchester council, came out of talking to like-minded campaigns which wanted premises that were more than an office, but had no time and energy to create them. Activists also wanted somewhere which would allow them to be integrated with local people. \"We felt we weren't starting at home,\" says Pickering. \"We were doing all these things on GM food and roads, it's all out there, but it's not reaching the people it needs to reach - local people.\" </p> <p>Four years, many a knock-back and much pragmatic fundraising later (they began with \u00a3100 in the bank, this year they've had a turnover of \u00a31m), Merci is a magical building, with a different buzz for everybody. </p> <p>For local kids, it's a fun palace built from a load of old rubbish. \"I come here every day now,\" says Michael Jenkins, \"because I can play on computers and meet interesting people.\" People like Neil Corney from Omega, one of the 11 campaigning groups which have moved into the second floor, says: \"It's a really enjoyable building to be in physically; people get to know each other, get to integrate with the local community and end up with lots of new ideas and new initiatives.\" </p> <p>For visitors, even going to the toilet is an education: \"Before coming to Merci, the most I did about the environment was take my bottles to Asda; now I know about collecting rainwater and using it to flush toilets, how to save energy and put to good use wasted materials,\" says Liam Ryan, from the Cardroom estate. </p> <p>Education is an essential part of Merci, whether you're on the top floor absorbing the You are Here exhibition reflecting on what it would take to make Manchester a sustainable city, and exactly how much rain does fall each year, or admiring the work of Whole Space, the environmental interior design company responsible for the colourful, light atmosphere and for reusing the silver heating pipes as railings on the ramp down to the building's welcoming entrance. </p> <p>The buzz reverberates outwards. Liam Ryan and Elaine Kilroy are on a steering group responsible for the regeneration of the half-derelict Cardroom estate. \"We'll be taking ideas from here into the discussions, especially avoiding anything that could be toxic, and the emphasis on recycling old stuff,\" says Kilroy. </p> <p>Another reverberation has touched the lives of 15 local young men. They did the bulk of the work fixing doors and windows from nearby demolished schools and hospitals, reusing timber brought by local builders who remembered boxing in the building when it was the Lads Club. Scooping up the leftovers from the Lowry gallery construction site, at first, Dean Centenara thought it \"was completely mad; all my friends thought I'd turn into a hippy. I did stop shaving for three weeks.\" But now a year and a completed building on, still clean cut, Centenara says: \"I've learnt to respect people with dreadlocks; my friends are really impressed that I can lay timber, put in a door and windows and weld window bars.\" (The bars he welded are works of art, designed by local children to convey underwater scenes - waves, starfish, and all the life they want to see in the canal). </p> <p>The buzz has reached the imposing doors of the executive members' office in Manchester's town hall. Martin Pagel, deputy leader, drives the councils' policies on the environment. Merci has inspired him to get together a consortium of social enterprises concerned with waste: \"We need a critical mass of voluntary projects and enterprises covering all the waste streams - from building rubble through to abandoned cars - who treat waste as a resource and an opportunity for creating jobs and training.\" He praises Merci: \"It's practical, it works. It helps me convince sceptics, or the 'can't be arsed' brigade - who don't go beyond environmental talk.\" </p> <p>Merci is part of the Network of Centres for Change. The best-known is the Centre for Alternative Technology in Machynlleth, south Wales. They are all making contributions to environmental and social change. Merci's distinctive commitment to use environmental ideas to tackle poverty and inequality comes partly from attitudes the founding members carry over from their protesting days. Pickering explains: \"I took with me a feeling that the way you change people's minds is through practical example, rather than bombard them with your own ideas.\" </p> <p>When they launched their building, Merci effectively launched a new style of regeneration. Now that the building is in working, living order, some of the restless Merci mob are moving on. Pickering is planning a new build programme, learning from the successes of the New Deal young people with the existing building. \"There's lots of derelict houses, lots of people needing training in skills. We know a lot about ecological refurbishment and providing good quality training. It's not hard to see a solution to bring this together,\" she says. They are also planning to establish a community business centre. \"Our aim is an economic strategy which the community can control and ensures money circulates as much as possible within the local economy,\" says Walsh. </p> <p>Over coming years, the practicality of Merci's model will be put to the test. While the council smiles benignly on the activities at Bridge-5 Mill, on site nearby, its jointly-owned company New East Manchester, is hosting what will be the largest Asda Wal-Mart in the country. As the vanguard of a revolution in retailing which, according to critics in the US, has pulled apart local communities, created a downward pressure on wages and sourced its supplies from companies employing sweatshop labour, Wal-Mart presents a different model of regeneration to that offered by Merci. The Wal-Mart project also poses a challenge to Merci's commitment to be close to the people, because after years of neglect and decline local residents welcome the new development. </p> <p>Manchester city council is insisting that Wal-Mart employ's local labour and is negotiating what it can in terms of the design of the building. Merci has two stones in its sling in face of such a goliath. First, long-termism. \"We won't win short-term battles, but we're here for the next 30, 40 years - goodness knows what will have happened to Wal-Mart then,\" says Walsh. Second, they inherit the hardworking non-conformity which helped to drive the industrial revolution along the Ashton canal. </p> <p>Wal-Mart has survived all the words US progressive movements can throw at it; how will it cope with a real living alternative? </p> <p>Contact Merci on 0161-273 1763 or email: <a href=\"mailto:merci@gn.apc.org\"> merci@gn.apc.org</a></p>",

Education is an essential part of Merci, whether you're on the top floor absorbing the You are Here exhibition reflecting on what it would take to make Manchester a sustainable city, and exactly how much rain does fall each year, or admiring the work of Whole Space, the environmental interior design company responsible for the colourful, light atmosphere and for reusing the silver heating pipes as railings on the ramp down to the building's welcoming entrance. The buzz reverberates outwards. Liam Ryan and Elaine Kilroy are on a steering group responsible for the regeneration of the half-derelict Cardroom estate. \"We'll be taking ideas from here into the discussions, especially avoiding anything that could be toxic, and the emphasis on recycling old stuff,\" says Kilroy. Another reverberation has touched the lives of 15 local young men. They did the bulk of the work fixing doors and windows from nearby demolished schools and hospitals, reusing timber brought by local builders who remembered boxing in the building when it was the Lads Club. Scooping up the leftovers from the Lowry gallery construction site, at first, Dean Centenara thought it \"was completely mad; all my friends thought I'd turn into a hippy. I did stop shaving for three weeks.\" But now a year and a completed building on, still clean cut, Centenara says: \"I've learnt to respect people with dreadlocks; my friends are really impressed that I can lay timber, put in a door and windows and weld window bars.\" (The bars he welded are works of art, designed by local children to convey underwater scenes - waves, starfish, and all the life they want to see in the canal). The buzz has reached the imposing doors of the executive members' office in Manchester's town hall. Martin Pagel, deputy leader, drives the councils' policies on the environment. Merci has inspired him to get together a consortium of social enterprises concerned with waste: \"We need a critical mass of voluntary projects and enterprises covering all the waste streams - from building rubble through to abandoned cars - who treat waste as a resource and an opportunity for creating jobs and training.\" He praises Merci: \"It's practical, it works. It helps me convince sceptics, or the 'can't be arsed' brigade - who don't go beyond environmental talk.\" Merci is part of the Network of Centres for Change. The best-known is the Centre for Alternative Technology in Machynlleth, south Wales. They are all making contributions to environmental and social change. Merci's distinctive commitment to use environmental ideas to tackle poverty and inequality comes partly from attitudes the founding members carry over from their protesting days. Pickering explains: \"I took with me a feeling that the way you change people's minds is through practical example, rather than bombard them with your own ideas.\" When they launched their building, Merci effectively launched a new style of regeneration. Now that the building is in working, living order, some of the restless Merci mob are moving on. Pickering is planning a new build programme, learning from the successes of the New Deal young people with the existing building. \"There's lots of derelict houses, lots of people needing training in skills. We know a lot about ecological refurbishment and providing good quality training. It's not hard to see a solution to bring this together,\" she says. They are also planning to establish a community business centre. \"Our aim is an economic strategy which the community can control and ensures money circulates as much as possible within the local economy,\" says Walsh. Over coming years, the practicality of Merci's model will be put to the test. While the council smiles benignly on the activities at Bridge-5 Mill, on site nearby, its jointly-owned company New East Manchester, is hosting what will be the largest Asda Wal-Mart in the country. As the vanguard of a revolution in retailing which, according to critics in the US, has pulled apart local communities, created a downward pressure on wages and sourced its supplies from companies employing sweatshop labour, Wal-Mart presents a different model of regeneration to that offered by Merci. The Wal-Mart project also poses a challenge to Merci's commitment to be close to the people, because after years of neglect and decline local residents welcome the new development. Manchester city council is insisting that Wal-Mart employ's local labour and is negotiating what it can in terms of the design of the building. Merci has two stones in its sling in face of such a goliath. First, long-termism. \"We won't win short-term battles, but we're here for the next 30, 40 years - goodness knows what will have happened to Wal-Mart then,\" says Walsh. Second, they inherit the hardworking non-conformity which helped to drive the industrial revolution along the Ashton canal. Wal-Mart has survived all the words US progressive movements can throw at it; how will it cope with a real living alternative? Contact Merci on 0161-273 1763 or email: merci@gn.apc.org",

It is even more difficult to see how Bush junior can completely repudiate the Kyoto protocol which basically just puts flesh on the bones of the original framework convention.

There is no serious doubt that adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere increases the temperature.

Some methods, as patients have pointed out time and time again, are horrendously crass. Studies in the child disability field reveal that about 50% of parents are dissatisfied with the way news of their son's or daughter's disability was given to them. </p> <p>This can have detrimental consequences for parents' subsequent relationships not only with medical professionals but with their own child. \"If news of a disability is portrayed negatively by a doctor, it can affect the bonding of parents to their child and particularly their view of disability later in life,\" says Robina Shah, a clinical psychologist working at St Mary's hospital, Manchester. </p> <p>In its own effort to address these training inadequacies St Mary's has offered, over the past three years, a \"sharing the news\" workshop to clinicians and nurses. The participatory workshop, developed by Shah, aims to refine professionals' communication skills when delivering distressing news. </p> <p>By focusing on the patients' perspective, it allows professionals - perhaps for the first time in their career - to devote a whole day to reflection on the details of how they break unpleasant news. </p> <p>In what room should they meet patients and relatives? Should they sit or stand? How much or how little should be imparted? How much medical jargon should be used? What is the best tone of voice to use? </p> <p>General rules about good eye contact, sensitivity and honesty are paramount - as is checking that pagers are switched off and that correct names are used. And even though consultation time is limited, doctors are encouraged to allow patients or relatives the feeling that they have their unwavering attention. </p> <p>Shah says: \"The training offers professionals the time and space to ask themselves the question: 'Can I do this better?' It offers them the opportunity to share models of good practice.\" </p> <p>The Royal College of Physicians, which has accredited Shah's course, recognises there is a lack of adequate training in communication skills and urges that training be made \"high priority\" in formal medical education. </p> <p>All the more reason, one might expect, for professionals to welcome the opportunity to sign up to such courses. Some doctors, nevertheless, remain sceptical of being formally taught how to communicate. They insist that \"hands-on\" experience remains by far the most effective source of learning. </p> <p>Charles Essex, consultant neurodevelopmental paediatrician at the Gulson clinic, Coventry, is convinced that being in the same room as a senior colleague, and watching as they disclose distressing news, is the key to self-improvement. </p> <p>\"I would not have learnt how to break news if I had not been with my senior colleagues and seen them do it,\" he says. \"It is like training to be an astronaut - you cannot do it until you have been with other astronauts. And it is during peer reviews that you learn what works for other consultants, and how one particular way of saying something is perhaps better than another. Reflecting on what you do and say is quite right; but this is something I do the whole time.\" </p> <p>Essex, who regularly has to tell parents of their child's disability, or even that the child may not survive long, accepts \"there is a place\" for courses such as Shah's. But he says he \"probably would not go on one\". </p> <p>Aware that this hardened attitude risks others dubbing him as old fashioned, Essex adds that it is a question of crude reality: bad news is bad news and cannot be dressed as anything else. \"I often give parents their worst nightmares, and no one will ever say: 'Thank you doctor.' If I say to parents that their child is going to die, or has autism, they should be angry or sad - if not, I have to question whether they have really heard what I said.\" </p> <p>It is such understandably distressing reactions by parents, Essex argues, that help explain statistics supposedly showing that relatives are dissatisfied with how bad news is broken to them. </p> <p>Nevertheless, other professionals who have attended Shah's workshop believe her approach does have place on the learning curve - particularly because peers cannot always be relied upon to give adequate guidance. Ian Dady, a consultant neonatal paediatrician, says: \"It is difficult for one doctor to advise or correct colleagues. There is an awful lot to remember when disclosing bad news and it can be beneficial to refine your skills.\" </p> <p>In addition, Shah explains, not all doctors have had exemplary peer role models to follow. \"They might never have had the opportunity to unlearn inappropriate things they picked up,\" she says. </p> <p>With the government emphasising clinical governance and lifelong learning, demands to improve professionals' communication skills are likely to come from the top. </p> <p>\"There will always be doctors who deliver news badly, and patients' complaints will reveal this,\" says Shah. \"This will always be something we have to work on.
