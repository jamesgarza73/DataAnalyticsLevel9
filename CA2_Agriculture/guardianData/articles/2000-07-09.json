Talk of European Directives and Compliance Guidance has been dry, complicated and theoretical. But, says the Institute for Employment Studies (IES), now that the regulations are in force, it's essential for support staff - who account for a large proportion of part-timers - to get to grips with their new rights or risk losing out in their pay-packets, promotion prospects and even the number of days they spend lazing on sun-loungers this summer. </p> <p>\"Of particular concern is that a huge number of secretaries don't realise that it's up to them to make sure their employers are treating them according to the new laws. They assume their employers will continually update their contracts to become legal whereas this very often doesn't happen,\" explains Dr Jo Rick, principal research fellow at the IES. </p> <p>It works like this. Europe as a whole realised that part-time workers were being discriminated against, big-time. Rarely were they given the same opportunities to climb the career ladder as their full-time colleagues and, in addition, they were often paid a lower hourly rate and were ineligible for proper holiday entitlement and maternity/parental leave. Part-timers also tended to be excluded from training. </p> <p>The result? The development of a European Directive which provided guidelines for the British government to come up with its own, more specific regulations. Not only do these regulations - which came into force on July 1 - state that all those methods of discrimination are now illegal, but they apply to employees and workers, including agency workers and homeworkers. </p> <p>\"So if you work for a recruitment agency and discover that you're not getting the same proportionate level of annual leave as a full-time worker with the same agency, you no longer have to put up with it,\" says Sarah Eldoori, spokesperson for recruitment agency Office Angels. </p> <p>\"Mind you, there will still be one difference between employees and workers,\" points out Diane Sinclair, policy adviser to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. \"The right not to be unfairly dismissed will still be available only to employees.\" </p> <p>For those part-time employees, though, the new regulations simplify the legal position. \"Before the regulations came in, any part-timer - 80% of whom are women - wanting to take legal action against an employer for detrimental treatment had to claim indirect sex discrimination. In other words, the part-timer had to identify a man in a full-time position within the same company to compare themselves to. Now, being treated less favourably because you are a part-timer will be sufficient grounds in itself,\" says Sinclair. </p> <p>But, she adds, here lies another catch: \"If you want to pursue a claim because you're getting a lower rate of overtime or less access to a pension scheme on a pro-rata basis than a comparable full-timer, you've still got to identify someone to prove it. OK, they don't have to be male, but they do have to have a similar contract, work for the same employer and have a similar level of skills and experience. In small companies, that isn't exactly easy,\" she points out. </p> <p>So what's the first step for the average part-time secretary to ensure that an employer is taking account of the new rules? If you suspect you are being treated less favourably than full-time colleagues, you should make a written request to your employer for an explanation. The employer is legally bound to respond in writing within 21 days. </p> <p>There may be occasions when the boss will admit that the full-time secretary is indeed getting private healthcare cover while you, as a part-timer, remain stuck on NHS waiting lists. \"But before you storm out of the office to visit the nearest lawyer, you should be aware that when it comes to benefits - whether we are talking profit-sharing, subsidised mortgages or staff discounts - employers do have the right to exclude part-time workers so long as there are objective grounds,\" says a TUC spokesperson. </p> <p>Imagine, for instance, that you work 18 hours a week and you complain that Michelle down the corridor, who does the same job as you for 36 hours a week, has been given a company car. Your employer would be justified in claiming that he can't cut a vehicle in half, and even if he were to provide you with an L-reg Mini Metro, it would be of disproportionate cost to the organisation. </p> <p>According to Julie Edwards, employment partner at Edge solicitors in Birmingham, this is the most contentious area of the regulations, and will undoubtedly cause such confusion to some secretaries that they won't bother making a claim even when entitled to. In fact, she adds, this isn't the only flaw. While the regulations aim to encourage an increase in part-time working, there is still no right for a worker to demand to work on a part-time basis, even when it is a reasonable request. </p> <p>\"The directive's more aspirational elements are addressed in the 'best practice guidance' which accompanies the regulations,\" she says. \"Employers are merely encouraged to make a wider range of jobs available part-time, to make part-time work more accessible, including introducing flexible terms of working.

      "body": "<p>Last week, the traditional image of the loyal secretary was shaken by the news that the secretary of a Labour politician had been poached by the Tories to work for shadow foreign secretary Francis Maude. Worse still, this is the second time that secretary Anna Tolchard has crossed the political floor in less than a year. When her then boss, MP Shaun Woodward, defected from the Conservative party to Labour at the end of last year, she followed him. But loyalty to her boss has been superseded by loyalty to the Tories - or so the party's spin machine would have you believe. The Tories are thrilled at her return to the fold (one has labelled her a \"super secretary\"), although she and Woodward are said to have parted on good terms. </p> <p>We hear much about the poaching of senior management professionals. Indeed, whole businesses are set up on the back of head-hunting or \"searches\" for the right person by shrewd companies, particularly in niche markets where there is a small pool of experts to choose from. But stealing secretaries seems anathema to a profession known for its discretion and loyalty. Does it really happen within the administrative tier? </p> <p>A recent survey of support staff showed that the majority of companies still use agencies to find their employees, with media advertising and informal networks also quite common. When Louise Marks's boss left the branch of a holding company for head office, his recommendation of her to colleagues there allowed her a move of her own to HQ, though not to work for him. \"It was an excuse to get away from where I was, though the particular job he got me was working for a guy who was so boring that I got another job in-house within six weeks,\" she says. </p> <p>Word of mouth is one thing. But the consensus on formal head-hunting techniques within the administrative sphere is that these methods are rare. Richard Grace is managing director of recruitment agency Gordon Yates. He has yet to hear of an agency that provides a major service in the head-hunting of office staff. \"It doesn't lend itself to support staff,\" he explains. \"The population is much too large and not quite so defined.\" </p> <p>One reason is that the fit between boss and secretary seems to be more important than one might expect in a usual working relationship. \"Secretarial work is a unique assignment, in that personality is such an important part of the match, especially at more executive levels,\" says Grace. \"People form a pairing, and will consider that aspect if the boss moves across.\" </p> <p>Another scenario is when a boss returns to a trusted past employee when they can't find someone suitable to fill a post. Marjorie Mair, a consultant at the Industrial Society, believes that bosses often come back to what they know: \"Some people say poaching doesn't happen anymore, and others say there is more chance of it. There is a skills shortage and if somebody knows a really good PA and is having trouble recruiting, the first thing they will do is pick up the phone and ask if they need a job. You have to know the person as well as the work to do the job well.\" </p> <p>The effective relationship requires professional respect and an understanding of the person, as a professional and an individual. When a PA makes decisions for the boss, however small, they anticipate what that person will need and how he or she wants it done. This customised role is optimised when strong, mutual bonds are secured between the two colleagues. That close relationship will in turn engender a loyalty that will stand the boss in good stead. </p> <p>Patricia Constant faced a similar dilemma to that of Anna Tolchard, when her own boss, Conservative MP Alan Howarth, crossed to the Labour benches before the last general election. Mutual loyalty and respect won out. \"When Alan crossed the floor, I thought he was jeopardising his political career,\" she says. \"I didn't expect him to get a seat, since in the Labour party there is no question of fixing seats in the Commons. I expected him to lose his job - and me to lose mine - whenever the next election came, so it was not the best career move. But I thought he was very brave, and knew he was going to be pilloried and get a lot of personal attention, and I wasn't going to leave him in the lurch.\" As it turned out, Howarth was elected as Labour MP for Newport in Wales, and is currently junior minister for the Arts. Constant continues to work for him. </p> <p>Constant's experience illustrates the most common style of poaching in the secretarial field: when the boss is head-hunted, promoted or just chooses to leave for better pastures, the secretary might be asked to go too. Patricia Constant understands the reasons for that all too well: \"When two people work closely, particularly in the type of work where it is very much one-to-one and you work long hours, it is not surprising that personality plays a large part.\" </p> <p>But the assertive secretary has more to gain than just keeping a good working relationship. If the boss is poached for better prospects, it means the secretary's own status will improve. Cheryl Carter was PA to Rebekah Wade, deputy editor of the Sun. When the latter was recently appointed editor of the News of the World, Carter followed, a move that automatically enhanced her own career prospects. </p> <p>Something to consider when thinking of following one's colleague is why they are asking you to join them. Is it because they value you and the relationship, or, in the case of the more difficult characters, because they know you will put up with their unreasonable behaviour?

      "body": "<p><strong> Oasis</strong> Landsdowne Road, Dublin **** <br> </p> <p>Ever since the days of their Britpop infamy, Oasis have resembled something between a macabre drama and a deranged soap opera. The recent episodes alone would keep Coronation Street scriptwriters in jobs for several years: rhythm section quits in acrimony; rejigged band release \"classic\" comeback album; songwriter (Noel Gallagher) admits \"classic\" comeback album is crap; a feud over \"lifestyle\" prompts a newly drug-free Noel to walk out in disgust; wildman brother, Liam, and a cobbled together Oasis tour Europe without him. Impeccably and inevitably (and following tabloid stories of touring benders), the day before his crucial homecoming(ish) gig, Liam's wife (Patsy Kensit) walks out. </p> <p>So it's hard to know which is the greater surprise: that Noel is back, or that brother Liam is still with us. There is an argument which says that minus three of their original lineup, Oasis will never be the force that spawned Definitely Maybe. Few bands could withstand such losses, but Oasis are one of them. This is partly because of the simple construction of their music but mainly because of the fearsome charisma of the Gallaghers. </p> <p>For the first few numbers this is all that sustains them. Liam, surprisingly, cuts a more mature figure than the boorish lout we have loved/hated, and Noel's stony face holds an entire storybook. Hampered by high winds and poor sound, Who Feels Love, one of the only three cuts from Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants, all but blows into the sea. However, as a sliver of a grin creeps across the senior Gallagher's face, Oasis deliver. </p> <p>The key is Acquiesce. This song of brotherly togetherness has never sounded more inappropriate, nor more poignant. As the younger Gallagher finishes hurling out the lyrics, he announces: \"Don't believe what you read in the papers. We're not splitting up.\" The crowd roar and Liam walks across the stage to shake his brother's hand. From anyone else, this would have seemed absurdly scripted, but this sincere moment proves the turning point in the gig. </p> <p>Playing Shakermaker, Stand By Me, Wonderwall, Oasis seem to be rediscovering what had made them good. Although there's something curiously dated about the (mainly male) audience's sea of casual tops, these ageing sing-along songs take the wider canvas and the band fill in the details. Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol is rather mischievously dedicated by Liam \"to Blair's son, I think it's brilliant\". Inevitably, Noel chips in. \"This one's called Rock'n'Roll Star, and we are,\" he says, attitude undiminished by his regretted two years in the Met bar. </p> <p>Occasionally, the band reach the heady heights of their classic 1990s Maine Road shows. Noel seems genuinely moved when the crowd sing Don't Look Back In Anger. Most strikingly, a young fan dances precariously on the roof of the mixing desk tent during Live Forever, risking everything for a glimpse of immortality as the band's anthem is accompanied by gasps from the crowd. </p> <p>Heavyweight stuff, but questions remain over Oasis's own lifespan. Can they rediscover this spark on record? More to the point, will the senior Gallagher remain? Noel's solo performance of Neil Young's Hey Hey, My My (Into The Black) with the lyric \"It's better to burn out than fade away\" seems unusually provocative. But this would be a curious time to bow out. Far from the expected Tysonesque freakshow, Oasis sound like a great band limbering up for another shot at the title.</p>",

Hampered by high winds and poor sound, Who Feels Love, one of the only three cuts from Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants, all but blows into the sea. However, as a sliver of a grin creeps across the senior Gallagher's face, Oasis deliver. The key is Acquiesce. This song of brotherly togetherness has never sounded more inappropriate, nor more poignant. As the younger Gallagher finishes hurling out the lyrics, he announces: \"Don't believe what you read in the papers. We're not splitting up.\" The crowd roar and Liam walks across the stage to shake his brother's hand. From anyone else, this would have seemed absurdly scripted, but this sincere moment proves the turning point in the gig. Playing Shakermaker, Stand By Me, Wonderwall, Oasis seem to be rediscovering what had made them good. Although there's something curiously dated about the (mainly male) audience's sea of casual tops, these ageing sing-along songs take the wider canvas and the band fill in the details. Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol is rather mischievously dedicated by Liam \"to Blair's son, I think it's brilliant\". Inevitably, Noel chips in. \"This one's called Rock'n'Roll Star, and we are,\" he says, attitude undiminished by his regretted two years in the Met bar. Occasionally, the band reach the heady heights of their classic 1990s Maine Road shows. Noel seems genuinely moved when the crowd sing Don't Look Back In Anger. Most strikingly, a young fan dances precariously on the roof of the mixing desk tent during Live Forever, risking everything for a glimpse of immortality as the band's anthem is accompanied by gasps from the crowd. Heavyweight stuff, but questions remain over Oasis's own lifespan. Can they rediscover this spark on record? More to the point, will the senior Gallagher remain? Noel's solo performance of Neil Young's Hey Hey, My My (Into The Black) with the lyric \"It's better to burn out than fade away\" seems unusually provocative. But this would be a curious time to bow out. Far from the expected Tysonesque freakshow, Oasis sound like a great band limbering up for another shot at the title.",

      "bodyText": "As we struggle to squeeze more activities into increasingly hectic lives, many people are trying to make the most of their time by fitting exercise into their working day. Of course, women's magazines have been extolling the virtues of keeping in shape while at work for many years. However, while it's quite acceptable to flex your calf muscles discreetly or make dainty circular movements with your toes, alternately clenching each buttock in order to achieve a firm derri\u00e8re while tapping away at your PC might result in less enlightened colleagues avoiding your immediate vicinity for a couple of hours, under the misapprehension that you are suffering from chronic wind. A recent book, Workouts for Workaholics (Crunch Fitness Guides, \u00a38.20), which suggests routines you can sweat to during office hours, takes things a bit further and suggests you use everyday objects to help in your quest. If you do decide to use your briefcase as a dumb-bell, however, it's best not to look too serious, as your rapt concentration could be mistaken for aggression and you might find yourself escorted from the building.

      "body": "<p>It was in 1938 that Brian Valentine of Kent made the highest first-class score on this ground, 242, after which there was no more county cricket at the school. One can imagine that Leicestershire were a bit fed up with blighters coming from elsewhere to fill their boots on this lovely batting surface. If that was so, the home side must be fed up again. The first county game here in 62 years saw Surrey's Alistair Brown cruise past Valentine's record, then go beyond his own personal best of 265 as well, before finishing 295 not out. </p> <p>Even No.11, Saqlain Mushtaq, was able to register a championship best when he went past 45. He outpaced Brown, succeeding with a number of bravura strokes, as the pair added a punishing 141 for the last wicket. </p> <p>Then, this seemingly unequal contest - albeit between teams placed third and fourth in the first division - was dramatically exaggerated as the home side lost seven wickets in the half-session before tea. Now the record books were being checked for 'lowest' totals on this ground. In the end, the Foxes managed to just avoid that record. </p> <p>To all but diehard Leicestershire members, the pitch was a triumph for the school groundsman, Keith Exton. Even in a week of difficult weather he was able to unveil a surface that was a pale bis cuit colour: well grassed but dry and firm. Yesterday morning, with the tail-enders accompanying Brown looking just as much at home as the man who had passed 200, it was clear the pitch had become a batting heaven. </p> <p>Indeed, the ground had a heavenly aspect: an ocean of green, perfectly level and with boundaries set at the maximum 90 metres. But when fieldsmen thought the extra space enabled them to get around and save a boundary the ball simply fled from them. </p> <p>Even Saqlain was able to start by pushing drives that travelled as if across a billiards baize, deceptively making pace through the gaps. Later, buzzing with confidence, he jumped out to slog the occasional medium pace of Darren Maddy. Meanwhile Brown proceeded sedately. There were a couple of lovely cover drives early on, and the odd dismissive pull. Otherwise it was mostly easy singles. Finally, Vince Wells took what had become the vital wicket - the last one - as Saqlain, on 66, was bowled through a loose stroke. Even Anil Kumble, a world record-holder, got not a single wicket. </p> <p>Now, on a fine pitch, the home batsmen were challenged to answer a big total with one of their own. Like so many other sides this season they were conspicuously unable to. With Martin Bicknell and Alex Tudor bowling a good line and moving the ball away, three batsmen soon edged to the slips - among them, Aftab Habib first ball. </p> <p>On and on it went. The slow exit of batsmen signified irritation with themselves underlined by despair at their collective situation. From 51 for seven Neil Burns and DeFreitas doubled the score, their convincing despatch of the bad ball confirming the pitch quality, before DeFreitas was taken at silly point. By now the spinners were on. Given moderate weather, they look likely to engineer a sizeable victory - big enough, perhaps, to set yet another record on the old ground.</p>",

      "body": "<p>While Belgians may think that their capital is well on its way to being the recognised first city of a future Euroland, it is not in many people's Top Ten of destinations for a fun weekend. Brussels has pretty boring reputation. We Brits tend to think of it as inhabited by a vast army of faceless, overpaid Eurocrats, who spend their time dreaming up senseless laws to annoy everyone, while the Belgians have never escaped their dour image of people who eat 'mussels and frites', drink lots of beer and read Tintin comics. So it is a shock to discover that it is one of the Continent's best kept secrets: a vibrant, exciting city, seething with creativity. The kind of place where, for once, checking out the shopping, restaurants and nightlife will take a lot more of your time than the classic sightseeing of museums and monuments. </p> <p>Walk into a shop here and people are already talking prices in euros rather than Belgian francs. The language they're talking might well be English, Spanish or Italian, rather than the official native tongues of French and Flemish. People here are used to foreigners, and are friendly, irreverent and welcoming. And whether you are drinking in one of the hundreds of bars, browsing in fashionable designer boutiques, wandering through the many flea markets or dancing to frenetic techno music in a nightclub, you are bound to end up getting to know locals who are better than any guidebook at explaining their city. </p> <p>Any visit must kick off in La Grande Place, one of the world's most beautiful and grandest squares, lined with exquisite Baroque and Gothic architecture and dozens of fun caf\u00e9s. Tourists then tend to head into the adjoining Rue des Bouchers, a narrow, cobbled street awash with neon signs, extravagant displays of lobsters, prawns, oysters and crabs, and waiters desperate to tempt in potential customers. Resist the temptation, and let the tour groups go on inevitably to the daft, minuscule Mannekin Pis statue. This is the moment to start discovering the insider's Brussels. </p> <p><strong> SHOPPING </strong></p> <p><strong> 1 Elvis Pompiello</strong><br> </p> <p> 60 Rue du Midi </p> <p> Elvis is the King of Belgian haute couture hat-makers, and his stylish boutique has everything from pink sequined top hats to exquisite feather and taffeta creations. When he puts on one of his wild fashion shows, seductively-dressed live models sit in the shop windows, causing crowds to jam the pavement. Don't miss the outrageous pink interior of the hat store opposite, S2. </p> <p><strong> 2 Chez Ramon &amp; Valy</strong><br> </p> <p> 19 Rue des Teinturiers </p> <p> At first sight, this colourful showroom looks like any other fun second-hand clothes shop. But banish thoughts of Oxfam, as these two young Spanish designers, Ramona and Valy, have their own craft atelier, and specialise in reworking cast-off garments into highly original one-off outfits. Fashion shopping only begins here, as just around the corner is Rue Antoine Dansaert, the home of cutting-edge Belgian designers, from internationally renowned Dries Van Noten, to local newcomers such as Nicolas Voit and Patrick Pitschin. </p> <p><strong> 3 Bali-Africa</strong><br> </p> <p> 154 Rue Blaes </p> <p> Rue Blaes is one of the many streets in Brussels lined with dozens of antique and junk shops. It is a bargain- hunter's paradise. Nothing, however, quite prepares you for this tumbledown warehouse, teeming with affordable collectables from Africa, Asia and Latin America, which is run by a genial Balinese, who speaks perfect English. You soon lose yourself in a vast warren of tiny rooms filled to bursting with thousands of masks, statues, spears, jewellery, paintings and carved wooden furniture. If you want more elegant, art deco design, walk up to Rue Haute, where two shops, Jacques Brol (number 202) and the adjacent Bruxelles Intimes, have an irresistible selection. </p> <p><strong> 4 Sunday markets</strong><br> </p> <p> Place du Jeu de Balle </p> <p> It is easy to believe that everyone in Brussels devotes their Sunday mornings to wandering through the city's packed markets. Just by the Midi station, a dozen streets are overrun by what is called the Exotique Market. More Morocco than Belgium, it has noisy vendors hawking olives, fragrant oranges, fresh herbs and pungent spices. Over in the Place du Grand Sablon, a more chic crowd browse through expensive, but high quality antiques. But on the sprawling Place du Jeu de Balle stands what must be the ultimate flea market. Hundreds of packed stalls form a vast, chaotic myriad of bric-a-brac, curios, hidden treasures and pure rubbish. You'll end up spending hours sifting through all the wares. </p> <p><strong> 5 Kaat Tilley</strong><br> </p> <p> 4 Gal\u00e9rie du Roi </p> <p> The ultimate spot for chic shopping is the grandiose Gal\u00e9ries St Hubert, three iron- and glass-covered arcades built in 1846, which are a majestic monument to a time when Belgium was still a major colonial power. Smart families sit out on caf\u00e9 terraces, the traditional Taverne Henri serves the city's best moules frites , while chocolate lovers from all over the world head for the stately showroom of the Neuhaus family, who invented the praline . But the most enticing spot is the mystical boutique of leading young designer Kaat Tilley. She creates dreamy, romantic dresses, presented in an equally fairytale decor. And prices are a lot lower than for something as original in London. </p> <p><strong> EATING OUT </strong></p> <p><strong> 6 Le Petit Boxeur</strong><br> </p> <p> 3 Borgval, tel: 02 511 4000 </p> <p> Dining out is one of the most appealing aspects of this eclectic city, and this is typified by the hip, new restaurant, Le Petit Boxeur, in the heart of the bohemian St Catherine neighbourhood. The decor is tasteful and romantic - candles burning everywhere - the cuisine an inventive melange of French and Italian influences. There is, for instance, a 'lasagne' of squid stuffed with tuna and mussels, or saut\u00e9ed snails on a bed of stinging nettles with basalmic vinegar - all complemented by an impressive, if expensive, wine list. Booking is essential. </p> <p><strong> 7 Lola</strong><br> </p> <p> 33 Place du Grand Sablon, tel O2 514 2460 </p> <p> This smart, airy dining room - all pastel colours and minimalist furniture - wouldn't be out of place in New York's SoHo, especially with its open kitchen, where the chefs perform their skills in front of diners. The dishes are equally innovative, including an incredible raw foie gras accompanied by a warm lentil salad, and duck roasted in mango. Great for Saturday or Sunday lunch, as it looks out over the lively, weekend Grand Sablon antiques market. </p> <p><strong> 8 H\u00e9misph\u00e8res</strong><br> </p> <p> 65 Rue de l'Ecuyer, tel: 02 513 9370 </p> <p> This is the perfect spot for lunch after shopping in the nearby Gal\u00e9ries St Hubert. Be prepared for surprises, though, as you walk into what looks like an exotic harem salon with the feel of a Middle Eastern souk. Diners lounge on battered velvet sofas, waitresses rush between tables carrying steaming glasses of mint tea and huge plates of half a dozen different appetisers. The chef prepares most of the dishes at a huge table at the end of the restaurant, and his speciality is a great couscous. </p> <p><strong> 9 Bonsoir Clara</strong><br> </p> <p> 22 Rue Antoine Dansaert, tel: 02 502 0990 </p> <p> Even if you reserve a table in advance, be prepared to wait a while, as Bonsoir Clara, in the middle of the fashion district, is the hottest spot in town now - the place everyone wants to be seen in. Luckily it has a classy cocktail bar in which customers can while away the time. The decor of multi-coloured stained glass is stunning, the atmosphere electric, and fortunately the American-style fusion cuisine is pretty good too. The best news is that this is one of the few spots open on a Sunday evening, ensuring a good end to a Brussels weekend. </p> <p><strong> 10 La Tentation</strong><br> </p> <p> 28 Rue de Laecken, tel: 02 537 4547 </p> <p> This is a venue which completely changes personality between lunchtime and the evening. Entrepreneurs have transformed a cavernous abandoned warehouse into what is, ostensibly, a centre for Galician culture. You can do everything here: drink at the city's longest bar, have a cheap lunch buffet of Spanish tapas, enjoy a more gastronomic meal in the evening of specialities from Galicia, then move into party mode, when you'll see people on the dance floor doing the tango and the flamenco, and whirling to wild Gypsy violins and wailing Celtic bagpipes. Coming out onto the street, its hard to believe you're in Belgium! </p> <p><strong> BARS &amp; NIGHTLIFE</strong></p> <p><strong> 11 L'Archiduke</strong><br> </p> <p> 6 Rue Antoine Dansaert </p> <p> This is the best bar in Brussels, but don't expect to find it in many guide books, as loyal locals are determined to keep it for themselves rather than put it on the tourist bar- crawl circuit. Resembling a Fifties New York jazz dive, L'Archiduke is chic without being pretentious, though you have to ring an outside buzzer to be allowed in.

      "bodyText": "While Belgians may think that their capital is well on its way to being the recognised first city of a future Euroland, it is not in many people's Top Ten of destinations for a fun weekend. Brussels has pretty boring reputation. We Brits tend to think of it as inhabited by a vast army of faceless, overpaid Eurocrats, who spend their time dreaming up senseless laws to annoy everyone, while the Belgians have never escaped their dour image of people who eat 'mussels and frites', drink lots of beer and read Tintin comics. So it is a shock to discover that it is one of the Continent's best kept secrets: a vibrant, exciting city, seething with creativity. The kind of place where, for once, checking out the shopping, restaurants and nightlife will take a lot more of your time than the classic sightseeing of museums and monuments. Walk into a shop here and people are already talking prices in euros rather than Belgian francs. The language they're talking might well be English, Spanish or Italian, rather than the official native tongues of French and Flemish. People here are used to foreigners, and are friendly, irreverent and welcoming. And whether you are drinking in one of the hundreds of bars, browsing in fashionable designer boutiques, wandering through the many flea markets or dancing to frenetic techno music in a nightclub, you are bound to end up getting to know locals who are better than any guidebook at explaining their city. Any visit must kick off in La Grande Place, one of the world's most beautiful and grandest squares, lined with exquisite Baroque and Gothic architecture and dozens of fun caf\u00e9s. Tourists then tend to head into the adjoining Rue des Bouchers, a narrow, cobbled street awash with neon signs, extravagant displays of lobsters, prawns, oysters and crabs, and waiters desperate to tempt in potential customers. Resist the temptation, and let the tour groups go on inevitably to the daft, minuscule Mannekin Pis statue. This is the moment to start discovering the insider's Brussels. SHOPPING 1 Elvis Pompiello 60 Rue du Midi Elvis is the King of Belgian haute couture hat-makers, and his stylish boutique has everything from pink sequined top hats to exquisite feather and taffeta creations. When he puts on one of his wild fashion shows, seductively-dressed live models sit in the shop windows, causing crowds to jam the pavement. Don't miss the outrageous pink interior of the hat store opposite, S2. 2 Chez Ramon &amp; Valy 19 Rue des Teinturiers At first sight, this colourful showroom looks like any other fun second-hand clothes shop. But banish thoughts of Oxfam, as these two young Spanish designers, Ramona and Valy, have their own craft atelier, and specialise in reworking cast-off garments into highly original one-off outfits. Fashion shopping only begins here, as just around the corner is Rue Antoine Dansaert, the home of cutting-edge Belgian designers, from internationally renowned Dries Van Noten, to local newcomers such as Nicolas Voit and Patrick Pitschin. 3 Bali-Africa 154 Rue Blaes Rue Blaes is one of the many streets in Brussels lined with dozens of antique and junk shops. It is a bargain- hunter's paradise. Nothing, however, quite prepares you for this tumbledown warehouse, teeming with affordable collectables from Africa, Asia and Latin America, which is run by a genial Balinese, who speaks perfect English. You soon lose yourself in a vast warren of tiny rooms filled to bursting with thousands of masks, statues, spears, jewellery, paintings and carved wooden furniture. If you want more elegant, art deco design, walk up to Rue Haute, where two shops, Jacques Brol (number 202) and the adjacent Bruxelles Intimes, have an irresistible selection. 4 Sunday markets Place du Jeu de Balle It is easy to believe that everyone in Brussels devotes their Sunday mornings to wandering through the city's packed markets. Just by the Midi station, a dozen streets are overrun by what is called the Exotique Market. More Morocco than Belgium, it has noisy vendors hawking olives, fragrant oranges, fresh herbs and pungent spices. Over in the Place du Grand Sablon, a more chic crowd browse through expensive, but high quality antiques. But on the sprawling Place du Jeu de Balle stands what must be the ultimate flea market. Hundreds of packed stalls form a vast, chaotic myriad of bric-a-brac, curios, hidden treasures and pure rubbish. You'll end up spending hours sifting through all the wares. 5 Kaat Tilley 4 Gal\u00e9rie du Roi The ultimate spot for chic shopping is the grandiose Gal\u00e9ries St Hubert, three iron- and glass-covered arcades built in 1846, which are a majestic monument to a time when Belgium was still a major colonial power. Smart families sit out on caf\u00e9 terraces, the traditional Taverne Henri serves the city's best moules frites , while chocolate lovers from all over the world head for the stately showroom of the Neuhaus family, who invented the praline . But the most enticing spot is the mystical boutique of leading young designer Kaat Tilley. She creates dreamy, romantic dresses, presented in an equally fairytale decor. And prices are a lot lower than for something as original in London. EATING OUT 6 Le Petit Boxeur 3 Borgval, tel: 02 511 4000 Dining out is one of the most appealing aspects of this eclectic city, and this is typified by the hip, new restaurant, Le Petit Boxeur, in the heart of the bohemian St Catherine neighbourhood. The decor is tasteful and romantic - candles burning everywhere - the cuisine an inventive melange of French and Italian influences. There is, for instance, a 'lasagne' of squid stuffed with tuna and mussels, or saut\u00e9ed snails on a bed of stinging nettles with basalmic vinegar - all complemented by an impressive, if expensive, wine list. Booking is essential. 7 Lola 33 Place du Grand Sablon, tel O2 514 2460 This smart, airy dining room - all pastel colours and minimalist furniture - wouldn't be out of place in New York's SoHo, especially with its open kitchen, where the chefs perform their skills in front of diners. The dishes are equally innovative, including an incredible raw foie gras accompanied by a warm lentil salad, and duck roasted in mango. Great for Saturday or Sunday lunch, as it looks out over the lively, weekend Grand Sablon antiques market. 8 H\u00e9misph\u00e8res 65 Rue de l'Ecuyer, tel: 02 513 9370 This is the perfect spot for lunch after shopping in the nearby Gal\u00e9ries St Hubert. Be prepared for surprises, though, as you walk into what looks like an exotic harem salon with the feel of a Middle Eastern souk. Diners lounge on battered velvet sofas, waitresses rush between tables carrying steaming glasses of mint tea and huge plates of half a dozen different appetisers. The chef prepares most of the dishes at a huge table at the end of the restaurant, and his speciality is a great couscous. 9 Bonsoir Clara 22 Rue Antoine Dansaert, tel: 02 502 0990 Even if you reserve a table in advance, be prepared to wait a while, as Bonsoir Clara, in the middle of the fashion district, is the hottest spot in town now - the place everyone wants to be seen in. Luckily it has a classy cocktail bar in which customers can while away the time. The decor of multi-coloured stained glass is stunning, the atmosphere electric, and fortunately the American-style fusion cuisine is pretty good too. The best news is that this is one of the few spots open on a Sunday evening, ensuring a good end to a Brussels weekend. 10 La Tentation 28 Rue de Laecken, tel: 02 537 4547 This is a venue which completely changes personality between lunchtime and the evening. Entrepreneurs have transformed a cavernous abandoned warehouse into what is, ostensibly, a centre for Galician culture. You can do everything here: drink at the city's longest bar, have a cheap lunch buffet of Spanish tapas, enjoy a more gastronomic meal in the evening of specialities from Galicia, then move into party mode, when you'll see people on the dance floor doing the tango and the flamenco, and whirling to wild Gypsy violins and wailing Celtic bagpipes. Coming out onto the street, its hard to believe you're in Belgium! BARS &amp; NIGHTLIFE 11 L'Archiduke 6 Rue Antoine Dansaert This is the best bar in Brussels, but don't expect to find it in many guide books, as loyal locals are determined to keep it for themselves rather than put it on the tourist bar- crawl circuit. Resembling a Fifties New York jazz dive, L'Archiduke is chic without being pretentious, though you have to ring an outside buzzer to be allowed in. The barman shakes a perfect dry Martini, and most evenings there are cool concerts by a fine jazz trio. 12 A La Mort Subite 7 Rue Montagne-aux-Herbes Potageres Belgians love drinking beer, and although the city has more than its fair share of ancient watering holes, such as A la Becasse, Au Bon Vieux Temps and A L'Imaige Nostre-Dame, the Mort Subite has become more of an institution than a simple bar. Nothing has changed here for a century - the prices chalked on huge mirrors, the wood-panelled walls yellowed with smoke, the primly dressed waitresses balancing huge mugs of foaming beer. The Mort Subite - or sudden death - is also the name of a beer, though the best beverage to order is a slightly cloudy 'lambic', light and freshly fermented. 13 La Fleur en Papier Dor\u00e9 53 Rue des Alexiens Brussels's most famous citizen was the famed surrealist painter, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, and his favourite haunt was this equally surreal tavern, whose name in English is the Flower of Golden Paper. Founded in 1846 by a religious order, Les Soeurs de Charit\u00e9, this 'estaminet' - the dialect word for a bar - became a meeting place for painters in the Twenties. The three tiny salons are still decorated with scores of Dadaist paintings and surrealist poems hand-written on the wall. Apart from dozens of different beers, it also serves some fine wines and probably the best onion soup you have ever tasted. 14 La Java 31 Rue St Gery After midnight, the Brussels nightlife can get pretty wild, especially in the dozens of bars that cram the fashionable St Catherine's quarter. The young head for the Bizon bar in Rue du Pont de la Carpe, live reggae bands play in L'Antrephil in the Rue du Vieux Marche aux Graines. But to get in party mode, kick off at La Java, which gets so packed that customers look as though they'll burst through the big glass windows. The barman doubles as the DJ between hurling the cocktail shaker up in the air. 15 Fuse 208 Rue Blaes There's no lack of choice for late night dancing, but the one spot not to be missed is the Fuse. This is the mythical venue where techno music - Belgium's most questionable gift to the world - was born. Clubbing in Brussels is democratic, with few unpleasant bouncers vetting who is to be allowed in, cheap entrance prices, and drinks that never cost more than a couple of pounds, no matter how late it is. The Fuse doesn't really get going till after two in the morning. The best news of all is that there are three dance floors on different levels. The largest, of course, is for techno, but there is also one for house and another for chilling out to jazzy funk.",

      "body": "<p>In the early days of British television, Hughie Green bowed out of every show of Opportunity Knocks by turning to the camera and telling the viewers at home, most sincerely: 'Remember, it's your vote that counts.' It was the closest the viewer got to empowerment back in the Sixties and Seventies, beyond the interactivity of switching the set off. Shared experience is something else these days. </p> <p>And the idea of putting the power in the hands of the viewer, while simultaneously removing the privacy of the viewed, is an idea that is beginning to dominate television and the surrounding territories. Later this month, a television programme makes the public privy to the kind of places that the camera has never before been granted access, while simultaneously claiming to put the viewer in control. </p> <p>The event has been touted in some circles with the kind of zeal that accompanied the first footage of the Apollo Moon landings. But at the core of Big Brother is Hughie's first law - it really is your vote that counts. Sincerely. And this time, the stakes are high. This is not a vote that may lead to a impressionist getting top billing at Butlin's in high season. This is the kind of vote that could result in someone winning \u00a370,000 or throwing themselves in front of a train. </p> <p>'Never before have people consented to being filmed under close scrutiny for so long,' says Liz Warner, C4's commissioning editor for the series. 'It's the first time in the UK that the audience can be truly be involved and influence the destiny of the participants by voting for who stays and who goes.' </p> <p>For nine weeks, 25 cameras and 30 microphones will watch over the every move of 10 volunteers, who have been selected from more than 40,000 applicants to live in a specially built house. Each will be subsidised by a daily fee of \u00a330. Each week, the viewers vote on which member of the group is eliminated, until one emerges as the winner. </p> <p> Big Brother takes our continuing preoccupation with voyeurism and exhibitionism into a new arena. The show is an attempt to transform exhibitionism from a voyeur's pastime into a viewer's sport. Exhibitionism is normally associated with things out of the ordinary. What's on show here is the sheer banality of ordinary lives. </p> <p>Writing recently in the New York Times on the phenomenon, Marshall Sella made the point that exhibitionism is being marketed as a form of adventure: 'Exposure to media scrutiny is like being exposed to the elements. Only, the elements here are sight and sound, the heat of klieg lights instead of the sting of wind. We are asked to believe that this century's first explorers, our Scotts and Amundsens, are those who can withstand the pressures of the lens. Big Brother housemates travel down an Amazon of the self, unafraid to wash or weep [and not forgetting, please, to undress] in front of millions of strangers. And adversity, as everybody knows, breeds heroes.' </p> <p>Here the hurdles are the ups and downs of living within a confined space, with people you hardly know, and without certain creature comforts. The questions that beg to be asked are at what point would the camera likely to be switched off? and how far would this go in the name of entertainment? </p> <p>It's like the moment in The Truman Show when Jim Carrey's character turns violently on his wife to test if someone else is writing the script of his life. The production team look set to intervene. Laura Linney, the actress who plays his wife, shouts: 'You're so unprofessional.' </p> <p>The participants emerging from the house of Big Brother abroad are treated like heroes, and immediately shrouded by a particular type of fame - the promise of recording contracts and modelling contracts, and the rounds of the chat-show circuit. This must be their prime motive for participating. It's a line that can be traced back to the strand on The Word, in which members of the studio audience would do anything to get on television. </p> <p>But this is not simply a few minutes with an old man's dentures in your mouth in the name of notoriety, but a crowd of cameras and a cast of millions - C4 has high hopes - potentially witnessing your every move. The game of fame has changed. During In Bed With Madonna , Warren Beatty pointed out that the singer saw no point in doing anything unless she did it on camera. There are now members of the general public that will take the same approach, knowing that the rewards may be great, but aware, equally, that it is a kind of game and that each round brings them closer to the prize. </p> <p>What distinguishes Big Brother from the idea within The Truman Show is that whereas Truman was oblivious to his predicament, players within this show willingly hand over their privacy. </p> <p>An example of a programme that put 24-hour surveillance and hidden cameras to good use rather than simply letting the lens ogle and loiter was last week's The Secret Life of the Family. A hybrid emerging from the BBC's Science and Features departments, this was in its own way a deeper and more radical probe into the everyday lives of a group of people than Big Brother. The documentary was the stuff of education entertainment and horror as it homed in on the bug life that existed within the hair and clothes of an average family. </p> <p>For the viewers of Big Brother, this programme is another chance to play God. But it's the networks that have most to gain, from the convergence of confessional culture and new media. In the light of the success of these shows abroad, networks here are now fighting for the next one out of the factory, in the way that was previously the case with docu-soaps. The latest, The Mole, was the talk of this year's Montreux Television Festival. The format was quickly snapped up by Channel 5. </p> <p>The two themes that dominate, that of a level of interactivity within the grasp of the audience, and an elimination of privacy on the part of the subject, are currently found away from the camera, and in art and performance. </p> <p>Last month, novelist Will Self spent the best part of a week in the window of a London gallery, with nothing more than a computer and sunglasses that looked better on the Velvets. Every day, he wrote a story based around the characters who showed up to watch him, in order to witness the writer at work and be his muse. </p> <p>What better way to make someone read a story than to put them in it? But ultimately it was the novelty of the method, rather than the content of the result that seemed of interest. Previously, Tracey Emin had spent nine days in the nude painting and drawing in a gallery window as the world wandered by and commented. </p> <p>If the voyeurism and exhibitionism of Big Brother has an equivalent in the art world, Emin is it: a variation on a the lapdancer offering everything up for intimate scrutiny as the middle- class, middle-age men of the art world metaphorically stuff money in her knickers and dream of being in her unmade bed. Ultimately, for most of those coming to watch Emin, it was still essentially a woman with her breasts out. Just as, despite the mutterings of Big Brother being a social experiment, the sole reason for most people tuning in will be the prospect of witnessing relative strangers embroiled in a feud or a fuck. Millions of viewers in Holland tuned in to see two become one, under a blanket in the Big Brother house. The infra-red lighting revealing the blurry images added to the seediness of the whole episode. </p> <p>Finally, the TV viewer had become like a punter at a peep show. As a showcase for what happy bedfellows the internet, television and the concept of the interactive viewer could become, at the most fundamental level, Big Brother is the perfect vehicle. Ultimately, there is too little time within a television programme to ponder the banality of ordinary lives in the manner of CCTV scanning the forecourt of a petrol station. </p> <p>Something needs to happen, and in order to make it happen, something unreal has to be placed in the situation to create a narrative and the drama. In this instance, something has to be taken away. These characters are surrounded, and captured on film, by state-of-the-art technology, but they have to exist without the fundamental tools of communication - telephones, computers, television, faxes - that signpost their daily lives. This immediately makes the whole concept once removed from being the reality television that it claims to be. </p> <p>However, the internet makes it possible to wait and witness everything that happens, unabridged, and in real time. Outside the regular visits to the house on C4, there is the website to which everyone has access to all that's happening on the cameras all day and all night. </p> <p>The network has already attempted something similar with last year's Smart Hearts . Long after the pilot was over, it was possible to look at the programme's website to catch up on the instalments in this real-life soap in which a man, for the sake of the camera, lived with his ex-girlfriend and his current girlfriend. If Big Brother is, on one level, a webcam show for television, its internet site will take you to the parts that the TV show cannot reach, although television provided the platform for fans of the show to be privy to one of the participants going through their motions in the lavatory. </p> <p>'Exactly 21 frames went out on the air,' according to Paul Romer, one of the creators of Big Brother . 'That's less than one second. It shouldn't have been possible. But everything goes wrong at the same time. Someone is in there, and she is using the toilet paper at that instant, and two million people are watching.' </p> <p>Apparently, the reasons for the cameras being installed in the toilet were those of health and safety. Foreign producers expressed concerns that someone could keel over or fall victim to a heart attack while relieving themselves. </p> <p>There is a reason for making a programme that probes privacy in order to discover more about health issues and maybe even turn up some relevant forensic evidence that could ultimately bring about change, but that certainly isn't true of Big Brother . </p> <p>If Big Brother is a success here, within the realms of television and the internet, a further series would be expected to involve the viewer even more, in the manner of certain types of webcam pages. Not simply a case of choosing when someone is eliminated, but choosing when they defecate, fornicate, masturbate. </p> <p>Of course, to stay in the game, they'll have to comply. Remember, it's your vote that counts. </p> <p>\u0095 Big Brother can be seen from 14 July at <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother\">www.channel4.com/bigbrother</a>, with a one-hour special on C4 on 18 July</p>",

He fully anticipated the wave of outrage at his remarks, and the immediate outpouring of sympathy for Zoff.

'They are of the political left. And they are so weak, and their grip on control so feeble, that they must resort to using a football manager as a means of attacking me.' </p> <p>Notwithstanding that it was 180 degrees removed from what had actually occurred, this portrayal of Berlusconi as near-victim of yet another failed leftist plot - with Zoff cast in the most unlikely role of Che Guevara - was duly presented over his airwaves and by the many print journalists whom he controls. </p> <p>By Thursday, Zoff was not only gone but forgotten, as Giovanni Trappatoni - not only the most successful active manager in Italy today, but a Berlusconi loyalist, as Zoff was not - was named to direct the national team. </p> <p>Game, set, and match to Silvio. </p> <p>One snap of the fingers brings the rain; the next clears the skies immediately.

Notwithstanding that it was 180 degrees removed from what had actually occurred, this portrayal of Berlusconi as near-victim of yet another failed leftist plot - with Zoff cast in the most unlikely role of Che Guevara - was duly presented over his airwaves and by the many print journalists whom he controls. By Thursday, Zoff was not only gone but forgotten, as Giovanni Trappatoni - not only the most successful active manager in Italy today, but a Berlusconi loyalist, as Zoff was not - was named to direct the national team. Game, set, and match to Silvio. One snap of the fingers brings the rain; the next clears the skies immediately. But Berlusconi has now moved beyond even Bob Dylan's range. At this point, only the deeper talent of a Verdi might capture him whole. The opera could be called La Travestia . How sad that in Italy the indecent always triumphs in the end.",

      "body": "<p>As England's World Cup bid team packed their bags and licked their wounds after another mauling on football's world stage, they would not have been consoled by the German verdict on another victory over England. </p> <p>'Celebrating? Victory over England? Of course not,' said Thomas Schumann, sports editor of Stern magazine. 'We are celebrating victory, certainly, but not over England.You were not regarded as a serious threat - even before your hooligans went crazy in Belgium. There is no great job in winning this event over England . . . only in winning.' </p> <p>It is tough when you discover that the horse you have backed was not quite the right strain of thoroughbred but, not only that, was never at the races in the first place. That is the way Schumann sees it - and the way he believes most Germans interpret it too. </p> <p>'Everyone in Germany is delighted, of course,' he said. 'Because this was an unexpected triumph for us. All the media - tabloids, magazines, serious papers, and TV and radio are reacting like children at Christmas. This is a gift we didn't expect until probably about two hours before Sepp Blatter, the Fifa president, read out the word \"Deutschland\" from his envelope. In those last couple of hours leading up to the voting announcement, there was a growing sense that we might have won it.' </p> <p>So how do Schumann, Stern and the German media believe Franz Beckenbauer and his bid team pulled off such an astonishing coup? 'We think it was a clever arrangement between the German Federation and the Asian delegates - Thailand, South Korea, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,' said Schumann. 'There is talk of a deal between Daimler-Chrysler, the Mercedes parent company, and Hyundai. This may be true but it has very little to do with football. It is politics and high finance of the highest order. </p> <p>'The major TV stations here who are buying rights for the World Cup, paying some DM 3.4 billion for example, are desperate for a German team to play in the 2006 competition. Never has Germany's team looked so inept, but by winning the right to host the competition, the side are guaranteed to take place.' </p> <p>So how do the victorious Germans view the disconsolate, disbelieving South Africans, so confident of victory until so late in the day? 'Germans pity the South Africans,' said Schumann. 'South Africa should have got the World Cup because nobody in Germany or in England really needs the World Cup. You, the English, hosted a great Euro 96 four years ago and we, too, have shown that we know how to organise these big tournaments. But here we did not really consider England an issue in the vote. Remember, England had broken their promise not to bid against Germany for this tournament and that did cause bad feeling. Now, I would expect Germany to back any Asian bid to hold the tournament in 2010 because of the backing Germany got from Asia.' </p> <p>Did the Germans worry on Friday, as stories alleging bribery swept out of Zurich, that charges of corruption might snatch victory away from them? After all, Fifa did launch an immediate inquiry. </p> <p>'Not really, we're too busy celebrating,' he admitted. 'The letters pushed under delegates' doors were obviously a hoax and by Friday afternoon the story broke in Germany that Titanic magazine - a little like Punch in Britain - had admitted sending these notes. The supposed sender, Martin Hanson, does not exist.' </p> <p>What of Charles Dempsey, the 78-year-old delegate from New Zealand whose abstention in the final round of voting handed Germany their 12-11 victory? Had he backed South Africa, as his Oceania constituency demanded, Sepp Blatter's casting vote would have probably handed them the tournament. </p> <p>'People here are saying that the greatest amount of pressure came from Blatter - he was desperate for 2006 to go to South Africa,' said Schumann. 'Dempsey had made it known that he would vote for England until their elimination and Germans believe it was wrong for Blatter to exert any pressure.' </p> <p>And so is Germany prepared to host the event? How do the stadiums match up to England's? Is there the will to match the events hosted in Euro 88 and World Cup 74? 'Yes, there is, because unlike our failed bid to host the 2000 Olympics, there is major public backing for this event. Some 85 to 90 per cent of Germans are believed to be in favour. We have the political backing of government and some of the biggest businesses in the world. </p> <p>'We're ready, no doubt, and the stadia will be rebuilt and refurbished. The Berlin Olympic Stadium will be refurbished; Hamburg is building a new stadium that will match the best in the world; and there is an impressive, major new stadium in Gelsenkirchen. We aren't quite matching England's stadia yet - but we will.' </p> <p>And, apart from the obvious repercussions for South Africa and, indeed, England, Schumann reckons the backdraught from Thursday's vote will be felt most by Blatter. 'He is on very dangerous ground now,' said Schumann. 'There will undoubtedly be repercussions from this whole bidding process. Blatter wanted South Africa and he is a big loser. His job is safe until 2002 but then it looks as though he could lose that, too.' </p> <p>There was even a hint of German humour in their reaction to victory in the bidding race. Titanic's editor, Martin Sonneborn, admitted his magazine's hoax and said their second fax to delegates promised Swatzwalder Schinken (German ham) and a cuckoo clock. </p> <p>Meanwhile Der Spiegel's website reported: 'Charles Dempsey, the accomplished golfer who has frequently battled with Germany's World Cup bid boss Franz Beckenbauer on the golf course, will have to explain his actions to his Football Federation on Sunday.' </p> <p>What could they be hinting at?</p>",

      "body": "<p>More of France's 22 newly-crowned European Champions can be found in England than any other country. At the moment there are three times as many in the Premiership as there are in the French First Division. These are players whose reputations are soaring by the trophy, so coveted they could virtually handpick their club while Europe's giants woo them with their Blankety Blank cheque-books and pens. So why England? </p> <p>Why Fabien Barthez, when you love to pose in Monte Carlo, do you jack it in for a place with a ridiculous amount of rain? Why Robert Pires have you rejected the Champions League holders for a club that under-achieves in Europe? Why Christian Karembeu have you traded Madrid for a town where, according to one of L'Equipe's most esteemed scribes, a French footballer would want to commit suicide after two weeks? </p> <p>Reasons why the French come to England part one: The global package. This is what enticed Barthez. He knows he is joining a club with ambitions as vast as his own. Manchester United are, of course, in Europe, they boast a strong squad led by a clever coach, play in an exciting championship, and can afford to keep him in the manner to which he has become accustomed. Top French players who cross the Channel for anything other than money find it difficult to see beyond London or Old Trafford and while the capital gets the nod for lifestyle, Manchester wins for footballing status. In Monaco, in front of meagre crowds in their tiny jewel of a stadium, Barthez got bored. He responds to pressure, crowds and the hottest of spotlights. A born showman, he may well get the Mancunians singing a post-Eric reprise of The Marseillaise. </p> <p>Reasons why the French come to England part two: Money. It is this that has lured Karembeu. It is optimistic to imagine an urbane sophisticate with cosmopolitan tastes, dreadlocked cool, a supermodel wife, an international double and a pair of Champions League winners medals living happily ever after on Teesside. But like Marcel Desailly, who doesn't seem overly enamoured by English football, the pull of the purse is too tempting. The Chelsea defender seemed eager to move at the end of last season but has stayed for an improved contract. </p> <p>Reasons why the French come to England part three: Le Boss. Following in the footsteps of Patrick Vieira, Gilles Grimandi, Reme Garde, Nicolas Anelka, Emmanuel Petit and Thierry Henry, Pires has signed not only for Arsenal, but more importantly, for Ars\u00e8ne. After a season of despair at Marseille Pires needs a fresh challenge to develop a potential not yet fully realised. The burning question is whether he has the character to take that challenge on and answer those critics who say he's too nice, too fragile. </p> <p>Ten years ago the dainty Pires would never have come to England. But the example of his predecessors gives him a decent chance. If David Ginola, hardly known for his toughness, could make such an impression on English football, why should he be afraid? French Anglophiles owe a debt to the trendsetters, Cantona and Ginola, who proved to Gallic sceptics that it was possible for artists to thrive among the hurly burly of les rosbifs . </p> <p>The Frenchification of the Premiership looks set to continue. Two more looking to enhance their reputations here are Olivier Dacourt, who should profit more among the bright young things at Elland Road than he did during his spell with Everton, and Frederic Kanoute, of whom great things are expected at West Ham after his impressive loan period last season. </p> <p>For your average French footballer, aside from the attractive combination of colossal wages, a cracking league and a cushy life there is less fear of failure in England than elsewhere. Significantly, Desailly believes the Premiership is an easier competition than Serie A, and it has not gone unnoticed that fewer Frenchmen flop in England than in Italy. Vieira and Henry are frequently used as examples of players who floundered in Serie A (at Milan and Juventus respectively), yet have flourished so fantastically in the Premiership the Italians would break the bank to have them back. So far, they seem happy to stay but you can't help feeling that they will some day find a second crack at the Southern European heavyweights irresistible. </p> <p>This summer Serie A has taken on two new additions from France's Euro 2000 squad: Johan Micoud has gone to Parma and David Trezeguet to Juventus.

The soft landing was harder than I thought.

After checking that the bones of both rider and mount were where they ought to be, we headed uphill and into the dense jungle of maquis, the fragrant bushes that choke the island. </p> <p>The horses were working harder now and even Prune had become sure-footed as we rode up higher, scrambling over rocks, scratched by the maquis and bitten by the sun. St\u00e9phane, still facing backwards, signalled when to duck for dangerously low branches. (Alas, Arlette was not very flexible.) </p> <p>After almost two hours (including injury time) we reached the lost village. For the first time since arriving in Corsica I was sure where I was. </p> <p>We had started badly: after driving for more than an hour round Propriano, a small port, we still hadn't found the apartment. Then we spotted another rental car doing circles. </p> <p>Mark and Sarah were looking for the same block and had been told, helpfully, that it had a white gate. We decided to join forces, stopping locals to ask for directions. Of course, no one knew where it was. Here the streets have no signposts, the apartment blocks no names. Finding a 'tourist attraction' is a challenge; even getting to the beach is difficult. </p> <p>The southern tip of the island has not yet discovered tourism but, thankfully, it has spawned tour reps, one of whom finally led us, tired and hungry, to the pearly gates. </p> <p>It doesn't help to have a guide book. I was armed with the Rough Guide and Lonely Planet but still managed to miss my target every time. They both suggested: 'to get to the Alignement de Pagliajo (with 258 menhirs - megalithic statues - it's the largest collection of its kind in the Mediterranean) park your car at the wine-tasting warehouse, then follow a dirt track behind it for about 1km'. We had wandered about 300m down a dirt track (there were several) when a man in a four-wheel-drive kindly pointed out that we were going the wrong way. </p> <p>We got back in the car and drove about another kilometre down the main road to find a gate (as promised) on our right with a small sign saying: 'Menhirs. Please keep the gate closed.' </p> <p>It was another two kilometres on foot to the site. I had been expecting a spectacular prehistoric version of China's rows of terracotta warriors, but was greeted by about 30 tombstone-like menhirs, jammed upright in scattered rows of six or so. I don't know what had become of the other 228. Perhaps they had been swallowed whole by the creeping, omnipresent maquis - or maybe someone had just left the gate open. </p> <p>Not far away is Cauria, which has two alignements and a dolmen (stone burial site). The small sign marking the turn-off can be seen only if you are travelling the wrong way; you then follow the road until, as one guidebook instructs, you reach a sign riddled with bullet holes. </p> <p>Another two-kilometre hike from there and you come across the Alignement de Stantari: a single row of nine standing menhirs, one of which has a sword carved into its chest and another with a face frozen in a scream. On the other side of this menhir, you can see the sculpted back of his head, shoulder blades and a spine. </p> <p>Across yet another field, over and under several fences, is the Alignement de Renaggiu, an anarchic arrangement of stones and menhirs, some of which seem to form a path leading into a small wood, thought to have been sacred. </p> <p>I was halfway up a cork tree, trying to negotiate the steps straddling another fence on my way to the burial site, when I realised just how clever our Sartenais cousins were. Not only had they carved and carted these stones here, around 2,500 years ago, using the most primitive of equipment, but they had a real purpose. They had chosen these sites for safety and the statues - thought to represent gods, the dead or even enemies - stood guard over them. So successful were they that even today they stand largely undisturbed, with only the most persistent travellers finding them. </p> <p>The island's most famous prehistoric site, Filitosa, about an hour's drive north of Propriano, is in the middle of a town. There are lavatories, bars and souvenirs and postcards. You buy a ticket (and a guide book, whether you want it or not) to get in. </p> <p>Here are the kings of menhirs: some tall, square and well-armed, some small with pointy noses and chiselled chins. They have been rearranged by their minders: no explanation is given, although the tourists who queue up to be photographed hugging one don't seem to mind. </p> <p>But I missed the challenge. The feeling of breaking through the maquis to discover something special, mysterious. </p> <p>The horses knew the way to the lost Genoese village well.

He had subsequently travelled around the island four times. It doesn't surprise me: he was probably lost. </p> <p><strong>Corsica facts</strong></p> <p>Kathryn Whitfield travelled with Corsican Places in mid-season, flying from Stansted airport with European Air and staying in a self-catering apartment at the Residence Dominica, Propriano.

      "body": "<p>We all think we can imagine a perfect beach. But what is it that makes one strip of palm-shaded ocean-scoured sand better than any other? </p> <p>Many of the beaches of the Seychelles come pre-packaged with unique selling points: this, you discover, is the Bounty Bar Beach and that, a lone palm tree stretching out nearly horizontal to the ocean, is the Bacardi Beach. On your right, a guide informs you matter-of-factly, pointing toward a slim crevice in the cliff, is 'Robinson Crusoe's cave', while 'in front of you The Blue Lagoon was filmed with Miss Brooke Shields'; a little further on, you arrive at 'the location for Emmanuelle with Miss Sylvia Kristel'. </p> <p>But there are a couple of stretches of sand on the islands which purport to go one better even than these eclectic celluloid fantasies. Up in the north-west corner of Praslin, the second largest of the Seychelles main group of islands, are what, by some accounts, are the two finest beaches in the world. Who says so? Well, some German tourists, of course, who got here first and who had a notion that things like perfection are best quantified. </p> <p>Still, when a Berlin-based travel magazine invited its readers to nominate their favourite places on Earth to pitch towels, in first place they ranked Anse Lazio on the northern tip of Praslin and in second place they nominated Anse Georgette a mile to the south. Spend a day on either and, while acknowledging that both would be hard to beat, you come to realise that a beach hit parade is a subjective business. </p> <p>Despite their proximity, the two beaches could hardly be more different: Anse Lazio boasted a car park full of four-wheel drives and a large restaurant and was relatively dense with afternoon bathers; Anse Georgette was accessible only by boat, or by strong swimmers, or overland through a stretch of jungle in the torpid heat, and was deserted. </p> <p>In a vague attempt to bring some science to the question, I sat in the circle of shade cast by the ancient and low slung takamaka tree that provides a landmark at the back of Anse Lazio, and lay subsequently in the afternoon sun on Anse Georgette, and squinted half-heartedly at a recently published doorstop tome on the idea of The Beach , written by American academics Lena Lencek and Gideon Bosker (and not to be confused with Alex Garland's somewhat better selling book of the same name), which promised to offer a detailed biography of paradise. </p> <p>In the rather exhaustive view of Lencek and Bosker - and their treatise took into detailed account 'the discreet charms of the bourgeois beach' and the particular pleasures of the 'blue-chip beach', the 'erotic beach' and the 'edifying beach' - the ideal Anse, it seems, 'collapses past and present into a matrix of water, sand, space and light, and moves us with the power of a drug, reorienting our sense of time and firing our slumbering hedonism'. After some (reoriented) hours of research, and the odd invigorating entanglement in the matrix of water and light (dips in the sea) I decided that both beaches succeeded on all counts (though if pressed I'd probably have my ashes scattered on Georgette). </p> <p>For all their beauty, though - and their firing of slumbering hedonism - beaches are not wholly the point of a holiday in the Seychelles. In many ways they should be seen simply as spectacular arrivals and departures lounges as you tour the islands by boat. </p> <p>The Seychelles are made for tropical Swallows and Amazoning, and Praslin, centrally located and accessible by air from the main island, Mahe, makes the perfect base: a little less busier than Mahe (Prasliners refer to Victoria, the world's tiniest capital, with shakes of their head, as if it was south-central Los Angeles) it none the less boasts some great places to stay, none better than the newly opened and spectacular Lemuria Resort, with its new championship golf course hanging over the sea and where, for example, if you play tennis, you may well be offered champagne, between points. </p> <p>In just under a week we visited half a dozen different islands from Praslin: some, like Coco Island, only smooth grey protrusions from the sea that provided anchorage for snorkelling - which including the thrill of swimming above a sea turtle as it made its thoughtful way between rocks, eyes blinking studiously; others big enough to have cemented their own particular culture: cars are banned, for example, from La Digue (a favourite destination of the Blairs), and we toured the island south to north raindrops-keep-falling-on-my-head style on boneshaking bikes (ox carts are the alternative, more sedate option). </p> <p>As well as its own atmosphere, each of the islands boasts its own flora and fauna. On Praslin, most spectacularly, the extraordinary coco-de-mer plants grow in the island's protected central rainforest, the Vall\u00e9e de Mai: vast trees that produce phallic catkins and wonderful buttock-shaped nuts, and which 'mate' (there are males and females) only on stormy nights, or by the light of the full moon, or when they are in the mood, depending on which myth you want to believe. (General Gordon of Khartoum was so entranced by this place that he declared it the original site of the Garden of Eden and the coco-de-mer the tree of life; his belief is given slightly more weight by the fact that, oddly, and despite many efforts over the centuries, the trees will propagate nowhere else on earth). On Curieuse, a half-hour boat trip to the north, we walked among the famed giant tortoises - 250 live and breed here and roam freely - which tore slowly at grass and occasionally rose on their haunches and mooched past each other, apparently frustrated with the paparazzi; while on Aride, further north again, half a million seabirds wheeled around the sheer granite cliffs, overseen by frigate birds, with their enormous wingspans, hovering. </p> <p>Apart from its its teeming bird population Aride is home to a nesting pair of British ornithologists, happily named Janet and John, who have lived here as virtual Crusoes for a couple of years with a small team of local volunteers. The group live in a makeshift compound of huts near the water's edge, by day studying the birds and turning out en masse to help the odd tourist boat through the heavy surf; by night attempting to protect the birds' nesting sites from poachers, who have, in the past, been known to make off with as many as a 1,000 eggs in one landing. The poachers can be fairly ruthless, Janet explained, and the islanders are armed only with 'torches and polite persuasion', but still this year the numbers of thefts has decreased. </p> <p>The group do a great little tour of the island, too: ours was conducted by Jimmy, a rasta twitcher, who led us animatedly through the forest collecting spices - ginger, saffron, aniseed - and carefully uncovering the ground-level nests of Noddy terns (there are no cats or rats on Aride to disturb them), pointing out flitting red-tailed tropic birds or letting Sooty terns perch on his shoulders, a dreadlocked Dr Dolittle. Jimmy, a native of Praslin, has lived here for a couple of years, and rarely ventured back to the bigger islands. He explained, smiling broadly, that the only thing he really missed were 'women, I guess'; Janet and John meanwhile, who joined us for a beach picnic, their eyes lighting up at the sight of strawberries, confessed to craving chocolate the most - somewhat ironically since the island is owned and protected by the Cadbury family. James Cadbury is an annual visitor, but even his rations, it seems, are quickly consumed. </p> <p>Over lunch John explained how they came to be here: they were selected Castaway -style from dozens of other applicants, on their perceived ability to survive together alone; John had spent the previous nine years studying swans bottoms for a Phd: his theory - which proved that the larger the bottom the more successful the female - was one of the few works of doctoral biology to have aroused the interest of the Sun . </p> <p>John's theory seemed to hold true, too, in Praslin's main nightspot, Bufe (the cupboard), into which entire younger portion of the island's 6,000 inhabitants squeezed every Friday and Saturday night; hemp is dried on the beach nearby, so it was a mellow crowd that seemed suitably unfazed by the DJ's odd predilection for Shakin' Stevens. Bufe is just down the road from Praslin's newly built colonial-style casino: a good place to unburden yourself of troublesome Seychellois rupees, before watching seasoned locals clean-up on the blackjack tables. </p> <p>The tourist brochures describe the Seychelles as 'unique by a thousand miles' and certainly moving between the islands you have a sense of being adrift from the rest of the world; there are no major diseases here, few mosquitoes, little apparent poverty - the islands enjoy the highest standard of living of any 'developing country' - and fairly relaxed mores: Praslin men, for example, frequently have children with four or five local concubinos. </p> <p>Certainly, lying on Anse Georgette, past and present suitably compressed, you could half convince yourself that General Gordon was right all along; or perhaps it is just that 'matrix of water, sand, space and light' doing its particular stuff. </p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong></p> <p>Tim Adams stayed on Praslin at the five-star Lemuria Resort which can be booked through Classic Connection which offers tailormade itineraries to the Indian Ocean. </p> <p>Lemuria Resort is the newest luxury five star property to open in the Seychelles.

If you're feeling down, follow some of these guidelines. </p> <p>\u0095 Make sure to eat lots of lean protein. It contains tryptophan and L-phenylalanine - substances that encourage the brain to produce the endorphins serotonin and noradrenaline (happy hormones). </p> <p>\u0095 Monitor your intake of sugary foods. Although they may result in your brain producing short bursts of endorphins, the sugar swings that they cause usually trigger mood crashes. </p> <p>\u0095 Try not to eat sugary foods until your stomach contains fibre-rich foods such as vegetables, pulses and wholegrains, as fibre suppresses rapid increases in your blood-sugar level and hence mood swings. Ensure that you eat plenty of fresh fruit (at least four pieces a day) because fruit contains slow-release sugars, which can lift and sustain your mood. </p> <p>\u0095 Try to eat as much fresh produce as possible. It contains high levels of vitamins and minerals, the nutrients required to maintain a healthy body and mind. </p> <p>\u0095 Drink enough water to help your body to absorb the beneficial nutrients in food. Adults should have 2 to 3 litres a day. </p> <p>\u0095 Don't drink too many caffeine-containing drinks. Not only can caffeine adversely affect your mood and energy levels, it can also inhibit your body's absorption of the beneficial nutrients in food.

They also contain high levels of potassium, a mineral that helps prevent and correct high blood pressure.</p> <p>20 firm ripe cherries with stems intact, 300g (10? oz) good-quality, plain eating chocolate, broken into small, even-sized pieces </p> <p>Carefully wash and dry the cherries, making sure to leave the stems intact. Break the chocolate into a heatproof bowl that can sit on top of a saucepan. Pour boiling water into a saucepan, then place the heatproof bowl containing the chocolate pieces over the water, making sure that the bottom of the bowl does not come in contact with the water. Stir the chocolate as it melts to ensure a smooth and even consistency. Remove the bowl from the pan once the chocolate has melted. Holding a cherry by its stem, dip into the chocolate, submerging the fruit halfway. Allow the excess chocolate to drip off and place the cherry on baking parchment to set. Work quickly through all the cherries before the chocolate begins to solidify. Make sure that no water remains on the cherries before dipping.</p> <p><strong>Swings in blood sugar and energy levels</strong></p> <p>Swings in your blood-sugar and energy levels can seriously affect both your mood and performance. If you experience such swings, try taking the following measures. l Although it may be tempting to reach for foods that contain 'quick-fix' sugars, they will only make the problem worse. </p> <p>\u0095 Chocolate and other sweet foods cause your blood-sugar level to rise quickly, which stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin, the hormone that rapidly brings it down. </p> <p>\u0095 Fresh fruits give the best slow-release, energy boost, so increase your fruit intake. </p> <p>\u0095 Eat plenty of protein-rich foods, including cheese, eggs, fish and chicken, especially for lunch, if you find that late afternoon is when your blood-sugar and energy levels crash. These foods will enable your body to control its blood-sugar levels more effectively. </p> <p>\u0095 Eat lots of chromium-rich foods, such as cheese, shellfish, baked beans and wholemeal products. Chromium helps your body overcome symptoms of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). </p> <p>\u0095 Make sure that you drink plenty of water throughout the day to enable all of the energising vitamins, minerals and slow-release sugars in the food that you eat to be absorbed by your body. Adults should aim to drink 2 to 3 litres of water a day. </p> <p>\u0095 Only drink alcohol when your stomach is full. Because alcohol is absorbed so quickly it causes the blood-sugar level to drop. The presence of food in the stomach slows down the rate of absorption, thereby lessening blood-sugar swings. </p> <p>\u0095 If you are a smoker, try to give up.

If you're feeling down, follow some of these guidelines. </p> <p>\u0095 Make sure to eat lots of lean protein. It contains tryptophan and L-phenylalanine - substances that encourage the brain to produce the endorphins serotonin and noradrenaline (happy hormones). </p> <p>\u0095 Monitor your intake of sugary foods. Although they may result in your brain producing short bursts of endorphins, the sugar swings that they cause usually trigger mood crashes. </p> <p>\u0095 Try not to eat sugary foods until your stomach contains fibre-rich foods such as vegetables, pulses and wholegrains, as fibre suppresses rapid increases in your blood-sugar level and hence mood swings. Ensure that you eat plenty of fresh fruit (at least four pieces a day) because fruit contains slow-release sugars, which can lift and sustain your mood. </p> <p>\u0095 Try to eat as much fresh produce as possible. It contains high levels of vitamins and minerals, the nutrients required to maintain a healthy body and mind. </p> <p>\u0095 Drink enough water to help your body to absorb the beneficial nutrients in food. Adults should have 2 to 3 litres a day. </p> <p>\u0095 Don't drink too many caffeine-containing drinks. Not only can caffeine adversely affect your mood and energy levels, it can also inhibit your body's absorption of the beneficial nutrients in food. Keep your intake to a maximum of three cups a day.</p> <p><strong>Cherries dipped in chocolate</strong><br> serves 4 <br><strong> Magic ingredient </strong>cherries </p> <p>The cherries will help your brain to produce the mood-enhancing hormones serotonin and noradrenaline. They also contain high levels of potassium, a mineral that helps prevent and correct high blood pressure.</p> <p>20 firm ripe cherries with stems intact, 300g (10? oz) good-quality, plain eating chocolate, broken into small, even-sized pieces </p> <p>Carefully wash and dry the cherries, making sure to leave the stems intact. Break the chocolate into a heatproof bowl that can sit on top of a saucepan. Pour boiling water into a saucepan, then place the heatproof bowl containing the chocolate pieces over the water, making sure that the bottom of the bowl does not come in contact with the water. Stir the chocolate as it melts to ensure a smooth and even consistency. Remove the bowl from the pan once the chocolate has melted. Holding a cherry by its stem, dip into the chocolate, submerging the fruit halfway. Allow the excess chocolate to drip off and place the cherry on baking parchment to set. Work quickly through all the cherries before the chocolate begins to solidify. Make sure that no water remains on the cherries before dipping.</p> <p><strong>Swings in blood sugar and energy levels</strong></p> <p>Swings in your blood-sugar and energy levels can seriously affect both your mood and performance. If you experience such swings, try taking the following measures. l Although it may be tempting to reach for foods that contain 'quick-fix' sugars, they will only make the problem worse. </p> <p>\u0095 Chocolate and other sweet foods cause your blood-sugar level to rise quickly, which stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin, the hormone that rapidly brings it down. </p> <p>\u0095 Fresh fruits give the best slow-release, energy boost, so increase your fruit intake. </p> <p>\u0095 Eat plenty of protein-rich foods, including cheese, eggs, fish and chicken, especially for lunch, if you find that late afternoon is when your blood-sugar and energy levels crash. These foods will enable your body to control its blood-sugar levels more effectively. </p> <p>\u0095 Eat lots of chromium-rich foods, such as cheese, shellfish, baked beans and wholemeal products. Chromium helps your body overcome symptoms of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). </p> <p>\u0095 Make sure that you drink plenty of water throughout the day to enable all of the energising vitamins, minerals and slow-release sugars in the food that you eat to be absorbed by your body. Adults should aim to drink 2 to 3 litres of water a day. </p> <p>\u0095 Only drink alcohol when your stomach is full. Because alcohol is absorbed so quickly it causes the blood-sugar level to drop. The presence of food in the stomach slows down the rate of absorption, thereby lessening blood-sugar swings. </p> <p>\u0095 If you are a smoker, try to give up. Nicotine inhibits the body's production of insulin and glucagon, both hormones that maintain a constant blood-sugar level.</p> <p><strong>Poached fresh figs</strong><br> serves 6 <br><strong> Magic ingredient</strong> figs</p> <p>Figs contain fructose-fruit sugar, which in the presence of fibre (conveniently also found within the figs) gives our body a slow-release, sustainable energy burst. You may be surprised to find sugar within the juice, but the fig fibre ensures that the sugar is absorbed slowly.</p> <p>600ml (1 pint) Italian red wine, 225g (8oz) white sugar, 18 fresh, ripe figs</p> <p>Place the wine and sugar in a non-aluminium saucepan large enough to hold all of the figs in one layer. Warm over a medium heat until the sugar has dissolved. Holding the figs by their stems, drop them gently into the wine-and-sugar mixture. Lower to a gentle heat and simmer for 7 to 10 minutes, until the figs are tender and deep-brown in colour. Using a slotted spoon, remove the figs, being careful that they don't burst, and transfer them to a serving dish. Reduce the syrup for about 6 minutes, or until it has become thick. Pour the syrup over the figs and allow the dish to cool to room temperature.</p>",

Flamboyant costumes were the order of the day, with see-through fishnet outfits a favorite in the daunting (28C) heat. Among the marchers was a soberly dressed provincial priest marching in solidarity with an event the Vatican had attempted to have cancelled. 'I'm not the Pope, but I'm here!' the Rev Vitaliano della Sala declared. Other marchers waved cheeky posters poking fun at the Church. 'Sisters are doing it for themselves,' waved one transvestite. 'Nuns on the Run' was worn by a group of men dressed in habits. David Felix, 54, from San Francisco, wore a placard around his waist: 'God is Gay'.

      "body": "<p>A short while ago, a reader got in touch to ask why, given that I was a nice Jewish boy, I did not keep kosher when I reviewed restaurants. The reason, I said, was very simple: THERE IS NO GOD. If solid rationalism did not already tell me this, the pricing policy at Spoon would have convinced me of it. For in a universe with a benevolent deity, such an outrage simply could not be. In any case, a restaurant critic who, through religious belief, had to avoid all shellfish, couldn't mix milk and meat, had to be sure his steak had been drained of blood in the correct manner and that his wine had been blessed by some rabbi working on an hourly rate would be about as much use as a vegetarian in an abattoir. Unless, of course, I reviewed for What Synagogue? magazine. </p> <p>At least I thought this was why I didn't keep kosher. Now, however, I have discovered the real reason, one that is far more profound than some little character quirk like a complete and unshakeable belief that God does not exist. It is that if I kept kosher, I could not eat at Smiths of Smithfield, a new restaurant in London's Clerkenwell. And that, I have concluded, would be a tragedy of truly cosmic proportions. </p> <p>Smiths, right opposite Smithfield meat market, is less a restaurant than a complex: on the ground floor is an all-day bar serving huge fried breakfasts in the morning and beer in the evening; on the first floor is a swish champagne bar; on the second floor, a bistro-ish dining room, and up the top - when they finish it - will be a swanky restaurant packed with pressed linen tablecloths and shimmering glassware. It is housed in a funky old warehouse of bare brick walls and stripped floorboards and sharp lights and is the brainchild of the Australian John Torode, late of the Conran empire. In preparation for this launch, he has travelled the length and breadth of the country sourcing rare breeds of livestock so that, once lovingly reared, they may be killed, butchered and served up in his restaurant. The animals may not thank him for it, but I do. </p> <p>Because the result, at least in the second-floor dining room, comes about as close to my ideal of an urban, wallet-friendly casual restaurant as makes no difference. The food is smart and modern without being self-consciously so, the service is efficient and the prices are entirely reasonable. Which is why I've been there three times since it opened a few weeks ago. </p> <p>The menu in the dining room is a model of simplicity. Starters are priced at \u00a34.50, mains at \u00a39.50 or \u00a310.50 and puddings at \u00a33.50. On my first visit to review, I began with a chunk of smoked haddock on a mustardy sauce which came with a crispy slice of Gloucester Old Spot bacon. The haddock was a grand piece of fish: the flesh was solid and smoky without being overly salted and the skin was crisp; the bacon added a marvellously meaty kick. My wife Pat said she wanted something soothing, so she chose the potato and lemon soup with fresh rocket, the leaves just dunked into the soft liquid and still fully in possession of their peppery end. </p> <p>A main course of rabbi-unfriendly crisp belly pork with mash and salsa verde was a grand, solid plateful. Oy vey, but the crackling! It was rendered to a fine crispness and the spiky salsa gave a friendly boost to the mellow flesh hiding beneath. Pat's chicken with black olives stuffed under the crispy skin came on a terrific chickpea mash, thick with fresh parsley and fine olive oil. The chicken itself was not, it must be said, a queen among birds. Though it was perfectly cooked, it tasted of very little, which seems odd given the efforts Torode has made with sourcing. Happily, it was saved by that mash, and doubtless he can go out and find himself a better chicken. By now we were stuffed but, ever the professionals, we forced ourselves to share the Smiths trifle. It was lifted from mundanity by a dark, juicy heap of fresh summer fruits right at the bottom. </p> <p>Like the menu, the short, carefully chosen wine list is encouragingly priced, with bottles starting at \u00a310 and rising no higher than \u00a323. And all of it - praise the non-existent Lord - is available by the glass. With water, great focaccia bread and a couple of glasses of Merlot, our bill came to under \u00a350. It is very hard to complain. </p> <p>There are, though, a few gripes. That bill, for example, contained one of those damned 'discretionary' 12.5 per cent service charges. Torode says it is there, rather than wrapped up in the price, because they want to keep the bills down, which doesn't really make sense given that it turns up on the bill anyway. Then again, when the service is this affable, it's hard to begrudge it. On a slightly darker note, a second meal there was marred by some silly cock-ups: a steak that was overdone and a piece of plastic wrapping that turned up on a plate of five-spiced roast duck. Perhaps it is a mark of how much I admire the place that I am prepared to let these things go. It was the day after another glowing review had appeared in the press and, for the first time, they were inundated with punters. </p> <p>The arrival of Smiths is just about enough to restore my faith in the London restaurant business though, thankfully, not my faith in the Lord. Because if he did exist, I might have to rethink my dietary habits and that, in turn, would mean having to forgo Smiths. That would never do. </p> <p>\u0095 Smiths of Smithfield, 67-77 Charterhouse Street, London EC1 (020 7236 6666). Dinner for two, including wine and service, costs around \u00a355.

      "body": "<p>What are gardening makeovers for? Not for gardening, obviously. A good garden must have humanity, and that can only come through personality, dedication, a sure sense of place and love. The last is a difficult deal - awkward and fumbly on the modern tongue, but unequivocal. There are gardens that demonstrate dedicated work enough and skill of an extraordinary level, but when there's no love involved, the result is sterile and unlovely. </p> <p>Makeovers are horticultural Muzak. They fill a space entertainingly. That is their function and, as such, they are a resounding success. But you get up from the table hungry. They do not nourish. Good gardens have soul. And I am sure the reason for gardening is to make something beautiful and, at the same time, to nourish the soul. You need both. Opinion might divide on the measure of the former, but not on the latter. A garden with no soul is empty. Gardens must have personality and style; they must never be formulaic or predictable. </p> <p>I think this is why most professionally 'designed' gardens are no good. It is incredibly difficult to make a good garden for someone else. I have tried and given it up as a hopeless job. (Yeah, yeah, I know, it could be just that my designed gardens were hopeless. But no, they weren't. They were good - though not good enough for me, which is exactly how I feel about nine out of 10 of the professionally designed gardens I see.) It either takes genius - which, happily, does exist - or else a sense of possessing the garden. But chucking money at a piece of outdoors will merely decorate it, and that is somehow depressing - gardens looking like hotel foyers. Perhaps the upshot of this is that public spaces are more amenable to being designed than private ones. The impersonality suits them. </p> <p>That is what makeovers are: public spaces. They belong to the audience, not to the household. Bland, easy, quick and chirpy. Junk gardening. </p> <p>Anyone who has a genuine interest in gardening would never get involved in any kind of makeover. Only people who are not interested in gardening, or just lazy, want someone to make over their garden. If you want to change your garden, then get on with it. Nothing beyond the limitations of health, time and money is stopping you. But I know wonderful gardeners with severe disabilities or rotten health, hardly any spare time and no spare money. </p> <p>The truth is that if you are lazy then you will never garden. Gardening is hard work. Gardening can be difficult, confusing and frustrating. It demands a commitment and a desire to learn and to keep learning. You have to accept that you will get wet and cold, hot and sweaty, sore, tired and depressed. It will cost you money and will take up more time than you have to spare. And this will make you feel, at times, as fully alive and as content as body and mind can be. That's the deal. Everybody who gardens knows that, as deals go, it is a pretty good one. </p> <p>If you pay someone to come in and 'do' your garden for you in the same way as you might get people in to 'do' your living room or kitchen, it will never be any good. It will not be true - and you can spot a phoney garden the minute you set eyes on it. Anyway, 'doing' a garden is like shovelling the tide, because a garden is never 'done' any more than a river or breeze is 'done'. Gardening is something you really do, privately and without inverted commas. </p> <p>I write as someone who has done garden makeovers in the past for television and is part of a television culture that manipulates events in order to suit the truth it wants to present within the context of a particular programme. But however you dress them up, other people's gardens are like other people's dreams - so much less interesting than your own. Anyone who has been reading this column regularly over the years will know that just as I prefer to work in my own garden more than anyone else's, so I like writing about my own garden best. I like the way that intimacy with a garden only grows with hundreds and hundreds of hours of acquaintance, of seasonal, even daily change and of the knowledge of your plants from seed to maturity. </p> <p>This garden Sarah and I have made here is coming to some kind of maturity now, seven years after we began planting. This is fantastic, but it also highlights all the design flaws and limitations that, until a year or two ago, one might have suspected but forgiven because it had not yet reached maturity. Those with children will know that the child is invariably the father of the man, and this is always true of a garden. The layout that seemed to be the guide for the future garden - a kind of trail chalked on to the ground that the garden could follow - is the thing itself. </p> <p>This is not all bad news. The excitement of seeing a garden grow is exactly the same pleasure as seeing a seedling emerge from the soil and, within a few weeks, become an outrageous flower. Gardens run along a dozen different timelines simultaneously. There are, of course, seasonal and plant-driven timescales, ranging from the emergence of seedlings a few days after sowing, to the gradual growth of a large hardwood tree. But there is also the human factor. As you grow and change, so, too, does your relationship with a garden. </p> <p>I am not sure if living with the same garden all your life does not mean outstaying your welcome. I suspect that 10 to 15 years is needed to see your garden grow, and at the end of that time almost anything you have planted, other than hardwood trees, is either fully grown or establishing well. Perhaps 30 years would confirm real maturity. </p> <p>I once asked the head gardener at Levens Hall, Cumbria - which dates back to the 1690s, making it the oldest garden in Britain surviving in its original form - how long it would take to recreate the famous topiary garden from scratch, if need be. The answer was 30 years. Which means all of the past 280 years have been spent containing and restraining its growth. It is an astonishing thought. Working on the series Lost Gardens has given me lots of opportunities to see how gardens will outgrow their human boundaries. Hedges become 100ft trees, lawns become scrub and vegetable gardens provide a wonderfully rich ground for weeds and then seedling trees to establish. </p> <p>In making up gardens, we are harnessing that almost uncontrollable growth for a few years. The whole place crackles with energy. Yet it is entirely benign, entirely at ease with itself and the rhythm of things. One of the things that is apparent in restoring abandoned gardens is how important straight lines and abstract curves become. We clearly impose straight lines on to the landscape to mark it out and restrict it, just as clearly as we mark out a street plan on a virgin site. But these are the first to show signs of freedom if they are let loose. </p> <p>At Levens Hall, there are a pair of huge beech hedges flanking the central path down from the topiary garden. During the Second World War, when there was not the manpower to keep it trimmed, the hedges grew across into one impenetrable barrier that had to be hacked back like a jungle. When nature was regarded as fundamentally hostile, the lines were straighter and more tightly maintained. As we got bolder, we grew to trust in a less autocratic dominion of nature. I used to think Capability Brown was a vandal for replacing the highly formal 17th-century gardens with his looser landscapes, but now I suspect that he, like the American Thomas Church more recently, was tapping into a wiser, more integrated relationship between the garden and nature. </p> <p>Brown's work was all on a grand, public scale - which makes him one of the first makeover artists, although his gardens took dozens of men years to create and he never saw any of them in their maturity. But then, for all his huge transforming schemes, he was a true gardener and knew that you cannot pull gardens like a rabbit out of a hat. The excitement is all in the growing.</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>The raspberries are good. All raspberries are better than almost any other fruit, but a good raspberry is a lovely thing. Although I have always known that, we have not grown them seriously until last year. There was no good reason for this, although, thinking about it, perhaps my real reluctance was for a fruitcage. I dreaded picking fruit as a child, because I hated to the point of hysteria being trapped in a cage with a fluttery bird - and the fruitcage always had fluttery birds in it. </p> <p>But I love raspberries and last year we ordered 'Glen Ample' and 'Malling Jewel' for summer, and 'Autumn Bliss' for an autumn crop, and I put in good stout posts as well as a fruitcage to protect them, the gooseberries and currants. </p> <p>In garden terms, that all amounts to an investment second only to a greenhouse or York-stone terrace. The redcurrants and gooseberries are a disaster, but the raspberries are doing fantastically well. I used to prefer autumn raspberries to summer ones, but I think that prejudice was based on the lack of competition and the fact that I had never grown a crop of summer raspberries. Our very wet local climate and a thick top dressing with good garden compost seems to have suited them fine. </p> <p>The first potatoes (Charlotte) were eaten with much celebration on Midsummer's Day, exactly 13 weeks after planting them. They are a good crop and perfectly ready. Last year we dug them two days earlier, but they were put in the ground 30 days earlier, and were not a better crop. </p> <p>There are two conclusions: one is that there is no hurry to get your early potatoes in the ground - better to wait until the ground is ready and warmed a little. The second is that you can set your calendar to harvest new potatoes 90 to 100 days after planting, whenever that might be. </p> <p>It is said to be inadvisable to grow raspberries near potatoes as they encourage blight. Encourage? The mind boggles. Raspberries or not, for the past three years we have had blight around now. </p> <p>Perhaps by the time this is printed it will have arrived again. In the past, we have cut the tops off and burnt them on the bonfire, digging the spuds and storing them indoors. But this year, if and when it comes, I shall earth up if necessary, burn the infected haulms off where they grow and leave the roots in the ground. By all accounts, this works well.</p>",

      "bodyText": "What are gardening makeovers for? Not for gardening, obviously. A good garden must have humanity, and that can only come through personality, dedication, a sure sense of place and love. The last is a difficult deal - awkward and fumbly on the modern tongue, but unequivocal. There are gardens that demonstrate dedicated work enough and skill of an extraordinary level, but when there's no love involved, the result is sterile and unlovely. Makeovers are horticultural Muzak. They fill a space entertainingly. That is their function and, as such, they are a resounding success. But you get up from the table hungry. They do not nourish. Good gardens have soul. And I am sure the reason for gardening is to make something beautiful and, at the same time, to nourish the soul. You need both. Opinion might divide on the measure of the former, but not on the latter. A garden with no soul is empty. Gardens must have personality and style; they must never be formulaic or predictable. I think this is why most professionally 'designed' gardens are no good. It is incredibly difficult to make a good garden for someone else. I have tried and given it up as a hopeless job. (Yeah, yeah, I know, it could be just that my designed gardens were hopeless. But no, they weren't. They were good - though not good enough for me, which is exactly how I feel about nine out of 10 of the professionally designed gardens I see.) It either takes genius - which, happily, does exist - or else a sense of possessing the garden. But chucking money at a piece of outdoors will merely decorate it, and that is somehow depressing - gardens looking like hotel foyers. Perhaps the upshot of this is that public spaces are more amenable to being designed than private ones. The impersonality suits them. That is what makeovers are: public spaces. They belong to the audience, not to the household. Bland, easy, quick and chirpy. Junk gardening. Anyone who has a genuine interest in gardening would never get involved in any kind of makeover. Only people who are not interested in gardening, or just lazy, want someone to make over their garden. If you want to change your garden, then get on with it. Nothing beyond the limitations of health, time and money is stopping you. But I know wonderful gardeners with severe disabilities or rotten health, hardly any spare time and no spare money. The truth is that if you are lazy then you will never garden. Gardening is hard work. Gardening can be difficult, confusing and frustrating. It demands a commitment and a desire to learn and to keep learning. You have to accept that you will get wet and cold, hot and sweaty, sore, tired and depressed. It will cost you money and will take up more time than you have to spare. And this will make you feel, at times, as fully alive and as content as body and mind can be. That's the deal. Everybody who gardens knows that, as deals go, it is a pretty good one. If you pay someone to come in and 'do' your garden for you in the same way as you might get people in to 'do' your living room or kitchen, it will never be any good. It will not be true - and you can spot a phoney garden the minute you set eyes on it. Anyway, 'doing' a garden is like shovelling the tide, because a garden is never 'done' any more than a river or breeze is 'done'. Gardening is something you really do, privately and without inverted commas. I write as someone who has done garden makeovers in the past for television and is part of a television culture that manipulates events in order to suit the truth it wants to present within the context of a particular programme. But however you dress them up, other people's gardens are like other people's dreams - so much less interesting than your own. Anyone who has been reading this column regularly over the years will know that just as I prefer to work in my own garden more than anyone else's, so I like writing about my own garden best. I like the way that intimacy with a garden only grows with hundreds and hundreds of hours of acquaintance, of seasonal, even daily change and of the knowledge of your plants from seed to maturity. This garden Sarah and I have made here is coming to some kind of maturity now, seven years after we began planting. This is fantastic, but it also highlights all the design flaws and limitations that, until a year or two ago, one might have suspected but forgiven because it had not yet reached maturity. Those with children will know that the child is invariably the father of the man, and this is always true of a garden. The layout that seemed to be the guide for the future garden - a kind of trail chalked on to the ground that the garden could follow - is the thing itself. This is not all bad news. The excitement of seeing a garden grow is exactly the same pleasure as seeing a seedling emerge from the soil and, within a few weeks, become an outrageous flower. Gardens run along a dozen different timelines simultaneously. There are, of course, seasonal and plant-driven timescales, ranging from the emergence of seedlings a few days after sowing, to the gradual growth of a large hardwood tree.

      "body": "<p>One-day internationals were incorporated into the cricketing calendar almost 30 years ago. The idea was to introduce vibrant, action-packed cricket to compensate for some of the more ponderous fare served up in Test matches - and to attract the punters. In the wake of the Lord's Test I can't help feeling that we have come full circle. </p> <p>I'm not alone in being mildly irritated that we have to wait until 3 August for the next Test to begin at Old Trafford. (Alec Stewart voiced the same reservations after England's victory at Lord's.) Instead we must tolerate a triangular series of one-day matches between England, the West Indies and Zimbabwe culminating in a final at Lord's on 22 July. </p> <p>Let's hope that the sun shines, that the matches are evenly contested and that there is some fine swashbuckling. Even if this is the case they won't be able to match the drama generated by the Lord's game. One-day cricket has become far more predictable than the ebb and flow of the modern Test match. </p> <p>The Lord's Test was uncommonly exciting but there have plenty of other recent instances when the conclusion of a Test has had us unwittingly gnawing away at our umbrella handles. In the Caribbean there have been the West Indies' victories over Pakistan and Zimbabwe and their epic Lara-inspired defeat of Australia in Barbados 15 months ago. England have contested nail-biters in Melbourne and Leeds (we'll forget about Centurion Park for the moment). </p> <p>Modern Tests are sometimes one-sided but rarely dull. This is mainly because the bat's predominance over the ball has subsided. In the Sixties both Ken Barrington and Geoff Boycott were dropped for scoring slow centuries; I can't see that happening in this decade. Why are runs so scarce? Is it the pitches, or the development of our stadia into cauldrons that encourage the ball to swing more? Is it the ball? Has the technique of batsmen declined drastically or - and here's an unfashionable view that is unlikely to gain much support from Fred - are bowlers getting better? </p> <p>Whatever the cause, five days of uninterrupted cricket - especially in England - are a rarity. This dents the coffers of the ECB but when it produces a match like the one we witnessed at Lord's no-one is too bothered. The slow, slow, quick, quick, slow progress of that game was mesmeric. Sales for the remaining three Tests are booming. Channel 4 and their advertisers must be purring and the sporting public is reminded that cricket is not such a dated, tedious game, at which we are pretty useless, after all. </p> <p>Mind you, it was vital that England should scrape home at Lord's to enliven the rest of the summer. In the aftermath of victory they cannot pay much attention to the old adage 'never change a winning side', though I think Dominic Cork better have another game and so must his pace colleagues, Darren Gough and Andy Caddick. This trio highlighted another turnaround from decades past. </p> <p>In the Seventies and Eighties the pattern was set: the West Indies whistled the ball past the batsmen's nostrils at regular intervals; England, lacking their firepower, dutifully pursued a line and length. At Lord's we had a mirror image. The key to England's bowling success was that they were hostile; they peppered all the touring batsmen with lifting deliveries and maybe because Caribbean wickets have become slower and slower over the years, the West Indians were flummoxed. Conversely the English batsmen were craving for Ambrose and Walsh to pitch short, which would at least provide an opportunity for scoring. They rarely obliged, though Franklyn Rose did at crucial moments. </p> <p>Barring injury England's trio of pacemen will surely stay together for the rest of the series. But at Old Trafford, where the ball usually turns nowadays, Robert Croft will presumably be drafted into the final XI instead of Matthew Hoggard. The young Yorkshireman endured an unforgettable Test. He's sure to remember the 45 minutes prowling in the pavilion with his pads on during the Cork/Gough partnership more vividly than anything he did on the field. I'm sure he won't be a one-Test wonder. </p> <p>However England will have to contemplate major alterations to their batting line up. In fact the best time to change a side is when it is winning so that the newcomers enter a vibrant dressing room rather than a doomed one seeking some startling intervention from outside. </p> <p>Sadly the reinvention of Mark Ramprakash as a Test match opener has failed. He looks even more tense there than in the middle order and this leads to fatal technical blips rarely sighted when he's playing on the county circuit. Nick Knight, admittedly hampered by injuries at Lord's to his back and in the second innings to his finger, has also been tormented by standard deliveries around his off-stump. </p> <p>So two places are vacant with three likely candidates to replace them. Nasser Hussain only has to recover his fitness to return as captain - though some runs would be handy as well. The other slot will probably be filled by a left-hander, either old or new. The form of Graham Thorpe and Somerset's 24-year-old opener, Marcus Trescothick, will be monitored closely during the triangular tournament over the next fortnight. Trescothick, an A tourist last winter, has made his mark this year as an aggressive opener and would provide a straightforward replacement for Ramprakash. If they opt for Thorpe then Michael Vaughan would be promoted to open with Mike Atherton. This dilemma will provide a little added spice to the one-day soaps before we settle back to the real drama of the Test series.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One-day internationals were incorporated into the cricketing calendar almost 30 years ago. The idea was to introduce vibrant, action-packed cricket to compensate for some of the more ponderous fare served up in Test matches - and to attract the punters. In the wake of the Lord's Test I can't help feeling that we have come full circle. I'm not alone in being mildly irritated that we have to wait until 3 August for the next Test to begin at Old Trafford. (Alec Stewart voiced the same reservations after England's victory at Lord's.) Instead we must tolerate a triangular series of one-day matches between England, the West Indies and Zimbabwe culminating in a final at Lord's on 22 July. Let's hope that the sun shines, that the matches are evenly contested and that there is some fine swashbuckling. Even if this is the case they won't be able to match the drama generated by the Lord's game. One-day cricket has become far more predictable than the ebb and flow of the modern Test match. The Lord's Test was uncommonly exciting but there have plenty of other recent instances when the conclusion of a Test has had us unwittingly gnawing away at our umbrella handles. In the Caribbean there have been the West Indies' victories over Pakistan and Zimbabwe and their epic Lara-inspired defeat of Australia in Barbados 15 months ago. England have contested nail-biters in Melbourne and Leeds (we'll forget about Centurion Park for the moment). Modern Tests are sometimes one-sided but rarely dull. This is mainly because the bat's predominance over the ball has subsided. In the Sixties both Ken Barrington and Geoff Boycott were dropped for scoring slow centuries; I can't see that happening in this decade. Why are runs so scarce? Is it the pitches, or the development of our stadia into cauldrons that encourage the ball to swing more? Is it the ball? Has the technique of batsmen declined drastically or - and here's an unfashionable view that is unlikely to gain much support from Fred - are bowlers getting better? Whatever the cause, five days of uninterrupted cricket - especially in England - are a rarity. This dents the coffers of the ECB but when it produces a match like the one we witnessed at Lord's no-one is too bothered. The slow, slow, quick, quick, slow progress of that game was mesmeric. Sales for the remaining three Tests are booming. Channel 4 and their advertisers must be purring and the sporting public is reminded that cricket is not such a dated, tedious game, at which we are pretty useless, after all. Mind you, it was vital that England should scrape home at Lord's to enliven the rest of the summer. In the aftermath of victory they cannot pay much attention to the old adage 'never change a winning side', though I think Dominic Cork better have another game and so must his pace colleagues, Darren Gough and Andy Caddick. This trio highlighted another turnaround from decades past. In the Seventies and Eighties the pattern was set: the West Indies whistled the ball past the batsmen's nostrils at regular intervals; England, lacking their firepower, dutifully pursued a line and length. At Lord's we had a mirror image. The key to England's bowling success was that they were hostile; they peppered all the touring batsmen with lifting deliveries and maybe because Caribbean wickets have become slower and slower over the years, the West Indians were flummoxed. Conversely the English batsmen were craving for Ambrose and Walsh to pitch short, which would at least provide an opportunity for scoring. They rarely obliged, though Franklyn Rose did at crucial moments. Barring injury England's trio of pacemen will surely stay together for the rest of the series. But at Old Trafford, where the ball usually turns nowadays, Robert Croft will presumably be drafted into the final XI instead of Matthew Hoggard. The young Yorkshireman endured an unforgettable Test. He's sure to remember the 45 minutes prowling in the pavilion with his pads on during the Cork/Gough partnership more vividly than anything he did on the field. I'm sure he won't be a one-Test wonder. However England will have to contemplate major alterations to their batting line up. In fact the best time to change a side is when it is winning so that the newcomers enter a vibrant dressing room rather than a doomed one seeking some startling intervention from outside. Sadly the reinvention of Mark Ramprakash as a Test match opener has failed. He looks even more tense there than in the middle order and this leads to fatal technical blips rarely sighted when he's playing on the county circuit. Nick Knight, admittedly hampered by injuries at Lord's to his back and in the second innings to his finger, has also been tormented by standard deliveries around his off-stump. So two places are vacant with three likely candidates to replace them. Nasser Hussain only has to recover his fitness to return as captain - though some runs would be handy as well. The other slot will probably be filled by a left-hander, either old or new. The form of Graham Thorpe and Somerset's 24-year-old opener, Marcus Trescothick, will be monitored closely during the triangular tournament over the next fortnight. Trescothick, an A tourist last winter, has made his mark this year as an aggressive opener and would provide a straightforward replacement for Ramprakash. If they opt for Thorpe then Michael Vaughan would be promoted to open with Mike Atherton. This dilemma will provide a little added spice to the one-day soaps before we settle back to the real drama of the Test series.",

      "body": "<p>Who on earth does Lord Hanson think he's kidding? Last week the grandfather of corporate predators savaged Britain's ambassador to Japan for allegedly leaking a memo warning of the dangers to inward investment of not joining the euro. </p> <p>Yet throughout a 30-year career of looting and pillaging companies (invariably UK and US ones), neither 'Europe' nor 'investment' featured highly on Hanson's self-aggrandising agenda. To the thousands of employees sacked by him and his late partner, Lord White, the reasons are still painfully clear. </p> <p>Europe, with its stricter employment laws, offered little scope for the unfettered mass firings, closures and sell-offs which went hand-in-hand with Hanson takeovers. And, in the pursuit of short-term profit, capital investment was next for the chop. </p> <p>Hanson's eponymous conglomerate-to-be floated on the Stock Exchange in 1964 and thrived during the Seventies under the patronage of disgraced City financier Jim Slater. It was in the Eighties however, under Hanson's heroine Margaret Thatcher, that he terrorised British boardrooms by bidding for established names such as Imperial Tobacco, Ever Ready and London Brick. </p> <p>The scars the Yorkshire haulier's son left on manufacturing industry are still as evident as his blinkering impact on Britain's corporate culture. When Hanson bought Ever Ready in 1982 the firm made 3 million batteries a day and was a leader in its field. When he sold it to US rival Ralston Purina 13 years later, output had slumped, the workforce had halved and its huge London research and development centre had closed. Its UK market share had fallen from 80 per cent to only 35 per cent as the likes of Duracell stole a march with better products. </p> <p>The story at Imperial Tobacco, bought in 1986, was much the same. While rivals such as Philip Morris and BAT invested in rapid international expansion, Imperial festered with dowdy domestic brands such as Embassy and Lambert &amp; Butler. In 1987 Imperial employed 11,000 people. By 1996, when Hanson flogged the firm off on the stock market, a wave of plant closures had 'downsized the headcount' - as Hanson's accountants might refer to staff - to only 2,750. </p> <p>Time and time again Hanson bought cheap, sold everything that didn't fit and ran what he kept for cash. Between 1964 and 1986, two thirds of the billions Hanson splashed out on deals was recouped from disposals. In 1991, that fate awaited ICI, but that turned out to be a takeover too far. </p> <p>For 10 years up to 1996, when he decided to break up the conglomerate, Hanson had greatly underperformed the stock market. True, shareholders who climbed aboard at the start saw a hundredfold increase in their investment. But for many of the 226,000 investors at the end, the 'Hanson experience' was hugely disappointing. </p> <p>The Treasury, too, suffered.

      "bodyText": "Who on earth does Lord Hanson think he's kidding? Last week the grandfather of corporate predators savaged Britain's ambassador to Japan for allegedly leaking a memo warning of the dangers to inward investment of not joining the euro. Yet throughout a 30-year career of looting and pillaging companies (invariably UK and US ones), neither 'Europe' nor 'investment' featured highly on Hanson's self-aggrandising agenda. To the thousands of employees sacked by him and his late partner, Lord White, the reasons are still painfully clear. Europe, with its stricter employment laws, offered little scope for the unfettered mass firings, closures and sell-offs which went hand-in-hand with Hanson takeovers. And, in the pursuit of short-term profit, capital investment was next for the chop. Hanson's eponymous conglomerate-to-be floated on the Stock Exchange in 1964 and thrived during the Seventies under the patronage of disgraced City financier Jim Slater. It was in the Eighties however, under Hanson's heroine Margaret Thatcher, that he terrorised British boardrooms by bidding for established names such as Imperial Tobacco, Ever Ready and London Brick. The scars the Yorkshire haulier's son left on manufacturing industry are still as evident as his blinkering impact on Britain's corporate culture. When Hanson bought Ever Ready in 1982 the firm made 3 million batteries a day and was a leader in its field. When he sold it to US rival Ralston Purina 13 years later, output had slumped, the workforce had halved and its huge London research and development centre had closed. Its UK market share had fallen from 80 per cent to only 35 per cent as the likes of Duracell stole a march with better products. The story at Imperial Tobacco, bought in 1986, was much the same. While rivals such as Philip Morris and BAT invested in rapid international expansion, Imperial festered with dowdy domestic brands such as Embassy and Lambert &amp; Butler. In 1987 Imperial employed 11,000 people. By 1996, when Hanson flogged the firm off on the stock market, a wave of plant closures had 'downsized the headcount' - as Hanson's accountants might refer to staff - to only 2,750. Time and time again Hanson bought cheap, sold everything that didn't fit and ran what he kept for cash. Between 1964 and 1986, two thirds of the billions Hanson splashed out on deals was recouped from disposals. In 1991, that fate awaited ICI, but that turned out to be a takeover too far. For 10 years up to 1996, when he decided to break up the conglomerate, Hanson had greatly underperformed the stock market. True, shareholders who climbed aboard at the start saw a hundredfold increase in their investment. But for many of the 226,000 investors at the end, the 'Hanson experience' was hugely disappointing. The Treasury, too, suffered. Adept use of offshore tax havens, fancy accounting and financial engineering meant that Hanson's contributions fell well below average UK corporation tax rates. Not that the Conservative Party moaned. Hanson was consistently the Tories' biggest corporate donor, and one of Thatcher's most strident supporters. The City, too, had reason to be grateful for the millions of fees clocked up by bankers and brokers on every deal. But arguably the biggest beneficiaries, though, were Hanson, his family and his many prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Even when the group ceased to perform well, Hanson and his colleagues pocketed some of the biggest pay packets in Britain. Doubtlessly, his dwindling band of supporters will protest at this comment on the old asset stripper's career. After all, he was repeatedly voted Britain's most admired businessman. That, however, was more a sign of the times than any great lasting achievement. And like his political mentor, the business face of Thatcherism shows little sign of retiring gracefully.",

The decision comes out of the G7 finance ministers meeting this weekend in Fukuoka, Japan, and will involve urging the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to focus debt relief on countries who are moving out of conflict. 'We believe there will be an increased incentive for these African countries to cease their internecine warfare if there is a large carrot of debt relief,' the source said. The source said greater progress had been made by the G7 finance ministers meeting than they were admitting, in order for the announcements to be made at the heads of government G7 World Economic Summit in Okinawa later this month. No formal communiqu\u00e9 was issued, but a summary said world economic prospects were brightening. The finance ministers agreed to ban 'unproductive aid expenditure' (code for arms and military spending) and to work with the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to ban export credits where the money was destined for arms expenditure. It is also understood that the British government intends to strengthen its aid effort, bringing together various branches currently working under the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence, and the Department for International Development (DfID) under one roof. A Whitehall source said: 'There will be a single line of accountability chaired by the Development Minister Clare Short and a lot more money will emerge from the imminent Comprehensive Spending Review. The countries where debt cancellation has been stalled are Burundi, the Central African Republic, Congo Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Somalia, and Burma. All but one are in Africa. The summit meeting also examined ways of regulating e-commerce without stifling it; money laundering and further reforms to the International Monetary Fund. It said the relief of Aids in Africa should be a high priority for the World Bank, which yesterday announced it was preparing a new $500 million programme. Countries would be eligible for 40-year loans.",
