The move would barely raise an eyebrow in the US, where patenting software and business methods has become common. But it is a significant first for Europe, where no company has yet patented a business process. Indeed, the Financial Times condemned the move as anti-competitive and a brake on innovation. </p> <p>Unwelcome or not, Halifax's initiative will not be the last. Gone are the days when patents meant widgets and Heath Robinson-type inventors. Patents today are the new business rock'n'roll, one of the hottest commercial battlegrounds - and the fate of the Halifax application will be watched far beyond the banking sector. </p> <p>Companies are becoming increasingly concerned with intellectual property issues, says Lyn Barkow, a patents specialist at Withers, a City law firm. She predicts a surge of activity on ideas which would not previously have qualified for protection. </p> <p>Like the cuckoo in spring, the prominent new role of patents is an unmistakable sign that the knowledge economy has arrived. According to the Brookings Institution, intellectual assets, including brands, know-how and patents, now represent more than 70 per cent of the market value of US manufacturing firms. For Internet firms, the proportion can be nearer 100 per cent. Attempts to fence off this valuable real estate to keep out trespassers are bound to become common. </p> <p>In the physical economy, patents were largely left to gather dust in drawers, dragged out only for defensive purposes - sometimes to spectacular effect. The great patent war over instant photography gained Polaroid nearly $1 billion in damages, and cost Kodak $3bn - probably the most expensive case of intellectual property mismanagement in history. </p> <p>Most companies, say Kevin Rivette and David Kline in their book, Rembrandts in the Attic: Unlocking the Hidden Value of Patents , start rummaging through that attic only when they are up against it financially. Examples are Texas Instruments, which now makes an estimated $800m a year from licensing deals, and IBM, whose $1.5bn in licensing revenues makes up a fifth of its profits. On the other hand, a new-economy company such as Cambridge-based ARM is a pure intellectual-asset play, its business model based entirely on licensing. </p> <p>Despite these role-models, US companies have underutilised their patent assets to the tune of a staggering $1 trillion, according to Rivette and Kline. But the pace is picking up as companies become more pro-active. Patent activity has doubled in the US, although in Europe, where protection is harder to get, the pace is still slow. </p> <p>The Internet has given a hefty shove to the patenting surge, dramatically raising the stakes of success and the intensity of competition. 'When you look at a new business, you ask: what's going to prevent people doing exactly the same and competing the profits to zero?' says Eileen Shapiro, a Boston consultant who helps companies with initial public offerings. </p> <p>Countering the FT , Shapiro argues that patents benefit customers as well as companies. The Internet offers opportunities to make genuinely better products and services, she reasons, and patents help ensure companies take these opportunities by giving firms incentives to focus on substantial rather than cosmetic improvements. </p> <p>Shapiro attributes much of the burgeoning patenting activity to the fact that the Internet infrastructure is now advanced enough for non-techies to develop new business methods. To cash in, some of the big consultancies are considering patenting their processes. And taking the idea one step further, entrepreneurs such as Jay Walker have set up 'patents factories' to generate patentable ideas for new firms. One of its patents for reverse auctions formed the basis for Internet firm Priceline, now worth $10bn. Patents marketplaces are inevitably being developed to trade promising ideas. </p> <p>Should Europe follow the US line on patenting business ideas? In the short term it may have little choice. As the importance of intellectual assets has grown, patenting has become an unacknowledged but potent weapon in the battle for national competitive advantage.

      "body": "<p>UK households waste \u00a36.5 billion a year on energy - \u00a3278 per household - according to the Energy Saving Trust. Cutting energy use would not only save you money, it would be good for the environment. At present the average house emits more harmful carbon dioxide gas than the average car. </p> <p>Water company Hyder, with the Energy Savings Trust, has suggested a number of ways of improving your home's energy efficiency, cutting bills at the same time: </p> <p><strong> Loft insulation:</strong> Installing loft insulation to a depth of at least 8in (200mm) can cut heating costs by up to 20 per cent. </p> <p><strong> Glazing:</strong> Up to 23 per cent of heat loss from a home can be via windows. Double glazing can cut this loss by up to 50 per cent. Using new energy-efficient glass can cut it by a further 10 per cent. </p> <p><strong> Cavity wall insulation:</strong> Most cavity walls, especially those built after 1930, can be filled. This can reduce heat loss by up to 60 per cent and save up to 35 per cent on fuel bills. </p> <p><strong> Draughtproofing:</strong> Putting this on badly fitting windows and doors can cut heat loss by up to 20 per cent. </p> <p><strong> Kitchen appliances:</strong> Buy an energy-efficient fridge, washing machine and other appliances. Look out for models labelled 'A' on the European Union's energy efficiency scale. They can use less than half the energy of similar models rated 'G', the lowest on the scale. Select the economy setting if possible. </p> <p><strong> Boilers:</strong> If your boiler is more than 15 years old, replace it with a condensing boiler and save 10-15 per cent on bills. </p> <p><strong> Bathroom:</strong> A bath or power shower uses up to 80 litres of water; an ordinary shower uses just 35 litres. A low-volume shower head can save a further five litres compared with a normal shower. If you have a big toilet cistern, ask your water company for a device to reduce the volume of water used per flush - or simply put a brick in it. </p> <p><strong> Heating controls:</strong> Upgrading your controls will help you to avoid overheating your home and water. Turning the thermostat down by 1 C can cut up to 10 per cent off bills. </p> <p><strong> Lighting:</strong> Use energy-saving bulbs and you can save up to \u00a310 per bulb. If every household replaced three conventional bulbs, domestic carbon dioxide emissions would fall by 6.7 per cent. </p> <p><strong> Garden:</strong> Use a hosepipe with a trigger control, have a rain water butt fitted to your gutters and mulch your plants.

      "bodyText": "UK households waste \u00a36.5 billion a year on energy - \u00a3278 per household - according to the Energy Saving Trust. Cutting energy use would not only save you money, it would be good for the environment. At present the average house emits more harmful carbon dioxide gas than the average car. Water company Hyder, with the Energy Savings Trust, has suggested a number of ways of improving your home's energy efficiency, cutting bills at the same time: Loft insulation: Installing loft insulation to a depth of at least 8in (200mm) can cut heating costs by up to 20 per cent. Glazing: Up to 23 per cent of heat loss from a home can be via windows. Double glazing can cut this loss by up to 50 per cent. Using new energy-efficient glass can cut it by a further 10 per cent. Cavity wall insulation: Most cavity walls, especially those built after 1930, can be filled. This can reduce heat loss by up to 60 per cent and save up to 35 per cent on fuel bills. Draughtproofing: Putting this on badly fitting windows and doors can cut heat loss by up to 20 per cent. Kitchen appliances: Buy an energy-efficient fridge, washing machine and other appliances. Look out for models labelled 'A' on the European Union's energy efficiency scale. They can use less than half the energy of similar models rated 'G', the lowest on the scale. Select the economy setting if possible. Boilers: If your boiler is more than 15 years old, replace it with a condensing boiler and save 10-15 per cent on bills. Bathroom: A bath or power shower uses up to 80 litres of water; an ordinary shower uses just 35 litres. A low-volume shower head can save a further five litres compared with a normal shower. If you have a big toilet cistern, ask your water company for a device to reduce the volume of water used per flush - or simply put a brick in it. Heating controls: Upgrading your controls will help you to avoid overheating your home and water. Turning the thermostat down by 1 C can cut up to 10 per cent off bills. Lighting: Use energy-saving bulbs and you can save up to \u00a310 per bulb. If every household replaced three conventional bulbs, domestic carbon dioxide emissions would fall by 6.7 per cent. Garden: Use a hosepipe with a trigger control, have a rain water butt fitted to your gutters and mulch your plants. Throw your sprinkler away. Rubbish: Most rubbish is taken to landfill sites and generates methane, a 'greenhouse' gas more potent than carbon dioxide, and potentially toxic run-off. Increase the amount of paper, bottles and cans you recycle. Composting food waste could cut your household waste by 50 per cent.

Check for any early payment penalties. Most people want a rainy day fund - equivalent to between three and six months' income - to draw on in emergencies. But after this, debt repayment offers a good, risk-free return. </p> <p> \u0095 Consider a flexible mortgage. These are halfway between current account mortgages and conventional home loans. There are facilities to repay debt without penalty and, sometimes, to take payment breaks.

      "bodyText": "If you are sold on the idea of concentrating your efforts on repaying debt, you don't necessarily have to sign up for a current account mortgage. Patrick Bunton of mortgage broker London &amp; Country, points out that not everyone hates their current bank: 'A lot of people have a good relationship with their bank and don't want to go to an unknown entity.' But you may be able to benefit from the money management system promoted by the current account product: \u0095 If you have savings on deposit, but don't repay your credit cards in full each month, start by concentrating on paying off card debt. \u0095 If you can afford to save, it may make sense to increase monthly mortgage payments, to shorten the term of the loan, rather than putting savings on deposit. Check for any early payment penalties. Most people want a rainy day fund - equivalent to between three and six months' income - to draw on in emergencies. But after this, debt repayment offers a good, risk-free return. \u0095 Consider a flexible mortgage. These are halfway between current account mortgages and conventional home loans. There are facilities to repay debt without penalty and, sometimes, to take payment breaks. You can also get access, within limits, to the overpayments (which will be stored as equity in your property) if you need to raise capital again. The rate of borrowing should be cheaper than on a conventional personal loan or credit card. They work best if you regularly pay off more than you need, or pay off lump sums. If you never keep a balance on your credit cards and have no overdraft or personal loan, a flexible mortgage and a low-cost current account may be all you need to smarten up your financial management. Bunton likes the flexible loans available from Yorkshire and Stroud &amp; Swindon building societies. Yorkshire has a loan at a variable rate of 6.74 per cent discounted by 3 per cent for four months. There are no redemption penalties. Stroud and Swindon has a fixed-rate flexi-loan at 6.29 per cent for two years with no penalties. Generally, rates on flexi-loans are a little higher than on standard mortgages. So if your priority is debt repayment and not flexibility, you may do as well with a low-cost repayment loan.

      "body": "<p>You have shopped around for a better deal on your savings. You made more than one phone call about a mortgage last time you moved house. You have changed to a cheaper credit card deal. You are not doing badly in the financial jungle. </p> <p>That's what you think. The financial engineers see things rather differently: to them, your methods verge on the prehistoric. What you need now, they say, is a plan that bundles your mortgage with your bank account - the twentyfirst-century way to manage your money. </p> <p>In July, the Halifax bank will become the latest to launch a product that aims to link your home loans with your savings and current accounts. Even the name of the new product, Intelligent Finance - or IF, as it will be known - implies that all other banking and savings products are for lower forms of financial life. </p> <p>IF will work on on the basis that for most people it does not make a sense to save in the conventional way. Borrowing is expensive, savings rates are poor, and the margin fattens bankers' profits. Customers who transfer borrowing, saving and banking business to IF will see balances on current accounts and savings deducted from from debts. So savings are, effectively, earning the same rate of interest as the highest rate the customer pays on borrowing. A person who has more savings than borrowings will pay no interest. Those who could benefit are older customers, who may have small mortgages but sizable sums on deposit. </p> <p>Using notional rates of interest - the real ones will not be confirmed until July - IF has constructed examples to show how savings could stack up. Take someone with a \u00a355,000 mortgage with HSBC charged at 7.64 per cent; an average current account balance of around \u00a3200 earning 0.1 per cent; savings of \u00a32,200 earning 5.25 per cent; and \u00a31,500 loan at 15.6 per cent with Marks &amp; Spencer. This customer would have a monthly net interest bill (interest paid, minus interest charged) of \u00a3399.88. If they switched all borrowing and saving to IF, this would fall to \u00a3332.12 - a saving of \u00a367.76 a month. </p> <p>There are other products already tilling the same ground as IF already, albeit it with different equipment. Closest to the Halifax product are the Virgin One account and the First Active current account mortgage. </p> <p>But neither account has signed up more than 25,000 people, mainly because the products are not easily understood. Halifax's product will be a gentler version of what Virgin and First Active offer, but will take advantage of the same basic financial logic. </p> <p>Since IF aims to have 500,000 new customers in its first year and 2 million by the end of 2004, it could start a minor revolution in the way we manage our money. </p> <p>Ian Giles of First Active says: 'If Halifax can't educate people on the merits of bundling products, who can?' </p> <p>The new method of money management works on the basis that debt is expensive, even at today's historically low rate of interest. The problem is that interest rates are low. If you are earning 6.5 per cent on your savings, the return would be 5.2 per cent after basic-rate tax, falling to little more than 5 per cent after inflation. </p> <p>For higher-rate tax payers, the return after tax and inflation dwindles to less than 4 per cent after tax and inflation. Debt, meanwhile, will cost anything from around 5 per cent, for a low-cost mortgage, to nearly 30 per cent if you use store credit cards. </p> <p>Current account mortgages encourage you to add consumer debts to your mortgage, transfer the loan to the current account provider and pay everything off at a rate of well under 10 per cent. If you need access to cash later, you can increase your mortgage simply by writing a cheque against the account. Another way of looking at this is to see the savings on the amount you would have paid in interest on loans as a return. For higher-rate taxpayers in particular, the returns make debt repayment perhaps the best risk-free form of investment available. </p> <p>A 40 per cent taxpayer would have to earn nearly 13 per cent on savings to match the saving achieved by repaying debt on a mortgage at 7.74 per cent. Even in a tax-free Individual Savings Account, it is not possible to achieve such returns at present. </p> <p>But the new method of money management is not for everyone. The products (explained in more detail below) appear complicated to people accustomed to keeping their mortgages, loans, credit cards and savings separate. </p> <p>And Graeme Stoner of accountant KPMG points out that where products allow flexibility to increase borrowing, there could be a temptation to borrow excessively against the value of your property: 'The concern I might have is that if your salary is \u00a32,000 a month and your mortgage \u00a3750, if you then spend \u00a31,500, you have increased your mortgage, not decreased it.' </p> <p>Virgin and First Active both say that safeguards built into their products ensure borrowing will not get out of hand. Virgin says that in a recent survey 92 per cent of customers were paying more than necessary on their home loans to ensure their mortgages would be paid off within their pre-agreed terms. </p> <p>Debt may be a good way to invest spare cash, but it is not necessarily the only way. Stoner says: 'We have clients who feel that having a mortgage is worthwhile because they can make their money work harder elsewhere: in business opportunities, for example, or the stock market.' </p> <p>But with the Halifax investing heavily in the development of IF, we can all expect to hear more about the benefits of bundling savings with borrowing. </p> <p><strong>The current account loan is a neat enough idea, but is it right for you?</strong></p> <p>Look at the questions below. If you answer yes to most of them, you will probably benefit from a current account loan, or from the type of product being promoted by the Halifax's new Intelligent Finance subsidiary: </p> <p>\u0095 Do you have debts on credit cards, store cards, bank overdrafts or personal loans? </p> <p>\u0095 Are these with high street banks (where the rates are generally the highest in the market)? </p> <p>\u0095 Do you have savings on deposit with a high street bank (where deposit rates are low)? </p> <p>\u0095 Is your income irregular because, for example, you are self-employed? </p> <p>\u0095 Do you regularly receive bonus payments in addition to a salary? </p> <p>\u0095 Can you afford to pay off some of your borrowing now? </p> <p>\u0095 Do you expect to have to borrow again in the next few years, maybe for home improvements or to pay for school fees? </p> <p>\u0095 Would it be useful for you to draw on debt you have overpaid, by taking a payment break or paying less into your mortgage in the next few years, during maternity leave, perhaps? </p> <p>\u0095 Are you prepared to monitor your mortgage and spending so that you repay as much borrowing as possible when you can afford to?</p> <p><strong>All-in-one accounts: pros and cons of the big three providers</strong></p> <p><strong>Virgin One</strong> </p> <p>This account was the first to combine current account and mortgage and promote the benefits of combining all borrowings and savings. It remains the most radical product of its type, because you must have your salary credited to the account each month. </p> <p>You move your mortgage and any other borrowings to Virgin, where all will be charged the same rate of interest; rates vary depending on the percentage of property value borrowed. The loan rate starts at 7.1 per cent, rising to 7.7 per cent. This is certainly cheap borrowing compared with mainstream credit cards, but it is not the cheapest mortgage rate in the market, and Virgin does not offer fixed rates or discounts. </p> <p>You can increase your borrowing after taking out the loan without going back to the lender for fresh permission, taking the loan to a maximum of 95 per cent of the property value. </p> <p>Each month, your salary goes into the account and reduces the mortgage instantly. Even if the debt rises again, as bills are paid during the month, the customer has saved money, because interest is recalculated daily, rather than annually as with most conventional loans. If you budget to overpay the mortgage on a regular basis, savings can be huge. Virgin calculates that on a \u00a370,000 loan charged at 7.29 per cent, a \u00a350-a-month overpayment will save the borrower more than \u00a319,500 and the mortgage will be repaid five years early. </p> <p>Virgin One issues a cheque book and credit card, which are all debited to the account. The drawback, according to new competitor IF, is that all borrowing is secured against the account holder's property. And some say the requirement to have a salary paid in each month deters many. The system may also seem daunting since the account - based on the mortgage - is like a permanent overdraft, even though it will get steadily smaller as mortgage payments come off. </p> <p><strong> Verdict</strong> </p> <p>Full marks for originality, but probably a product ahead of its time. Could be high risk for borrowers who do not monitor their account carefully, but should offer good value in the long term for people who can live within a budget. </p> <p><strong>First Active Current Account Mortgage</strong></p> <p>This aims to improve on Virgin One by offering fixed-rate mortgages and discounts. It offers full banking facilities, but customers do not have to have their salaries paid in. </p> <p>Customers can use the loan as a flexible mortgage if they prefer, making over-payments or underpayments as suits their needs. </p> <p>Ray Boulger at John Charcol says: 'Virgin insists that you pay your salary into the account but, generally, even though it may make sense, not everyone wants to do that.' </p> <p>For mortgages up to 75 per cent of the property value, the current rate is 4.49 per cent; rising to 4.74 per cent at 85 per cent of the value and 4.99 per cent for a 95 per cent loan. </p> <p>Ian Giles at First Active believes the current account mortgage 'makes the deposit account redundant'. Even so, he believes the product will appeal mainly to 'fairly sophisticated individuals' . </p> <p>Those most likely to benefit are borrowers who have some surplus cash each month to make overpayments on their mortgages. </p> <p><strong> Verdict</strong> </p> <p>Discounted rates and the option to maintain a separate current account make the product less daunting for nervous borrowers. </p> <p>It is a lower-risk choice for the spendthrift than Virgin's account, because the current account can be kept separate. </p> <p><strong>If - Intelligent Finance</strong> </p> <p>Halifax's new baby is not being promoted as a current account mortgage. </p> <p>But for those who put all their finances into the hands of IF, it aims to achieve the same advantages for borrowers as a current account loan would offer, by offsetting savings against borrowings. </p> <p>IF chief executive Jim Spowart says that most people are not yet ready for a current account attached to a loan.

It is probably easier for most people to understand, and may encourage more savers to question returns on deposit accounts against rates charged for borrowing. </p>",

First Active Current Account Mortgage This aims to improve on Virgin One by offering fixed-rate mortgages and discounts. It offers full banking facilities, but customers do not have to have their salaries paid in. Customers can use the loan as a flexible mortgage if they prefer, making over-payments or underpayments as suits their needs. Ray Boulger at John Charcol says: 'Virgin insists that you pay your salary into the account but, generally, even though it may make sense, not everyone wants to do that.'

Brian is a part-time library assistant working for a local authority, earning \u00a36,000 for a 17-hour week. When the local government pension scheme decided to let part-timers join in 1986, Brian immediately took up the offer.

There are some people, however, who may take advantage of the court ruling but find that they are no better off in retirement. The maximum basic state pension is currently \u00a367.50, but under the Minimum Income Guarantee the Government will provide extra money in the form of Income Support to any pensioner whose basic state pension is lower than this or whose total weekly income is less than \u00a378. Legal &amp; General calculates that you need a fund of about \u00a315,000 to pay out about \u00a310.50 a week - the shortfall between the current maximum basic state pension and the Minimum Income Guarantee.

'You can't rely on the Minimum Income Guarantee existing in future,' says Charles Levett-Scrivener of financial adviser Towry Law. 'You may be wasting your money building up a small pension fund.

That forms the crux of the argument by Standard Life, which is in the midst of a battle against carpetbaggers intent on forcing it to float on the stock market. </p> <p>The document it sent to its 2.3 million members warned that sharing profits with shareholders would mean lower endowment policy bonuses, smaller pensions or higher premiums. But read the small print and it seems most of these disadvantages would apply only to those taking out policies after Standard went public. Many existing policyholders would be no worse off - indeed they could benefit as they would get shares. </p> <p>However, the comments at the start of this article were made not by Standard but by Vanguard, one of the largest mutual organisations in the world. It could advise Standard Life on providing benefits of mutual ownership which can be clearly measured. </p> <p>Vanguard is the only company in the world which does not charge its investors a fixed fee on their policies. Instead, it simply charges them the costs it has incurred, making no profit or loss. The benefits to policyholders are clear. Last year, its average expense ratio - which includes everything from manager's salaries to marketing brochures - was 0.27 per cent of total funds. That is little over a fifth of the average US charge. </p> <p>The financial benefits of the low charges are impressive. Take an example of an investor putting \u00a31,000 into a fund which produces an 8 per cent return before charges. Over 10 years a Vanguard fund would grow to \u00a32,105; one charging industry average fees would grow to \u00a31,912 - almost 10 per cent less. </p> <p>'It is a phenomenal advantage, and without any extra risk,' said Brian Mattes at Vanguard. 'It is most evident in things like a bond fund [where capital growth is less of a feature]. That it is like a 100-yard dash where we start at the 50-yard mark.' But Vanguard's costs are not just low, they are reducing. Economies of scale mean it can manage more money without big cost increases. Last year alone, the rate fell from 0.28 per cent to 0.27 per cent; 10 years ago, it was 0.5 per cent. </p> <p>That belies one criticism of such structures: that companies which simply charge on their costs have no incentive to keep them low. At Vanguard, senior management bonuses are linked to keep costs low and efficiency high. Vanguard has a conservative investment style, but despite that its low costs keep it at the top of the performance tables over five and 10-year periods. Investors are enthusiastic: it has grown from a company with $1.8 billion in funds 25 years ago to become America's second-biggest mutual fund company, with more than $550bn under management. </p> <p>Vanguard is not strictly comparable with Standard Life. Its mutual funds are more like unit trusts, while Standard has long-term savings contracts such as pensions and endowments, where it has to protect policyholders from the ups and downs of the stock market. And its charges are already low compared with the rest of the industry: the expense to assets ratio is 1.1 per cent, less than half the industry average. But it does charge policyholders fixed fees: simply allocating costs would improve its performance still further. </p> <p>Standard has \u00a312.1bn of capital in its fund for future appropriations. The company says the capital is needed to invest heavily in equities, where returns are higher than in bonds or property. Only an actuary could judge the appropriate level of capital for a life company, but many have questioned whether Standard really needs that level of reserves. </p> <p>Standard's financial defence of mutuality is strongest for pension policyholders, who account for less than half its members, but 70 per cent of its new business. About three-quarters of them are either increasing their premiums or making additional single premium payments. And these, says Standard Life, would lose out if it converted to a public company. </p> <p>Actuarial rules ensure that the benefits of existing policies are not affected by demutualisation, but that guarantee does not apply to those taking out new policies. Standard says even those who just increase their premiums in line with inflation could be affected: Standard does not guarantee to treat the increase as part of the existing policy. A fifth of its pension savers use regular single premiums and each of these is treated as a new policy. It estimates that about 0.75 per cent of the return on a typical pension would have to go to its shareholders. If it is right, a 25-year pension, where \u00a3150 contributions are increased in line with inflation, would be worth 9 per cent less if Standard floated. </p> <p>In two weeks' time, Standard will make a further appeal to policyholders, based more on the less tangible benefits of mutuality: the passing of capital from generation to generation and the importance of retaining the mutual ownership structure. </p> <p>Will that count for more than the promised windfalls?

Anyone who regards fashion as the repressive construct of a metropolitan elite should worship these people as gods. </p> <p>From a glance around the impressive Lord's museum it is clear right from the off that the MCC's aims have actually been threefold: playing and staging cricket matches and waging an all-out terror campaign against the running dogs of haute couture. </p> <p>It all began with the colours. There are two explanations behind the MCC's choice (well, three if you include the rather dull one about the Star &amp; Garter club). One is that the person who came up with them was colour blind; the other that he or she was a wicked prankster. </p> <p>Personally I lean towards the latter theory. I imagine the joker experimenting with fabrics for years until the perfectly clashing shades of cherry and custard had been produced, then stitching together a tie, holding the finished product aloft and maliciously chuckling: \"Now let's see them find an outfit that will match this vile little bugger!\" </p> <p>Impossible, naturally, but such is the anti-fashion verve of the MCC's membership that most don't even bother to attempt it, opting instead to fling it together with the first thing that comes to hand. A pale blue sleeveless safari suit, perhaps, or a Tattersall check shirt buttoned incorrectly (and this is the sort of little detail that transforms an outfit from one that simply affronts the fashionistas to one that slaps them round the chops with a sand-filled sock) so that one half of the collar curls like a stale sandwich. </p> <p>Or they might plump for a mint green v-necked pullover displaying considerable evidence of past gastronomic indulgence. Just as scientists can uncover ancient weather patterns by studying the rings of fossilised trees, so future archaeolgists will be able to determine trends in middle-class dining habits by carefully scraping away the layers on an MCC member's jumper. </p> <p>Not, I should say, that the jumper is the product of slovenliness. Far from it. The garment serves an important purpose. The member knows that if ever food supplies run low he has simply to immerse his sweater in boiling water to produce a nutritious broth. It is not so much a pullover as knitted cup-a-soup (quite often complete with crunchy croutons). </p> <p>Under threat from the ever growing tyranny of style (many members have now abandoned baggy-crotched, straw-coloured corduroy trousers in favour of Blairite chinos) the MCC is now flaunting its colours like never before. </p> <p>The Lord's catalogue offers everything from button-down plaid shirts to boxer shorts in the characteristic septic-boil combo of yellow and red. There is a whole page of pyjamas and nightshirts. A little superfluous, perhaps, since it is clear from their rumpled appearance that most members sleep fully clothed. </p> <p>There is also a celebration of the heroic resistance in the museum. In one section on the first floor a little picnic tableau has been arranged. </p> <p>On the floor a rug is covered with a lavish picnic. Beside it on a fold-out chair sits a perfect waxwork of an elderly, moustachioed MCC member apparently in the act of falling asleep while munching a chicken drumstick. </p> <p>Well, at least I assume it was a waxwork.</p>",

From a glance around the impressive Lord's museum it is clear right from the off that the MCC's aims have actually been threefold: playing and staging cricket matches and waging an all-out terror campaign against the running dogs of haute couture. It all began with the colours. There are two explanations behind the MCC's choice (well, three if you include the rather dull one about the Star &amp; Garter club). One is that the person who came up with them was colour blind; the other that he or she was a wicked prankster. Personally I lean towards the latter theory. I imagine the joker experimenting with fabrics for years until the perfectly clashing shades of cherry and custard had been produced, then stitching together a tie, holding the finished product aloft and maliciously chuckling: \"Now let's see them find an outfit that will match this vile little bugger!\" Impossible, naturally, but such is the anti-fashion verve of the MCC's membership that most don't even bother to attempt it, opting instead to fling it together with the first thing that comes to hand. A pale blue sleeveless safari suit, perhaps, or a Tattersall check shirt buttoned incorrectly (and this is the sort of little detail that transforms an outfit from one that simply affronts the fashionistas to one that slaps them round the chops with a sand-filled sock) so that one half of the collar curls like a stale sandwich. Or they might plump for a mint green v-necked pullover displaying considerable evidence of past gastronomic indulgence. Just as scientists can uncover ancient weather patterns by studying the rings of fossilised trees, so future archaeolgists will be able to determine trends in middle-class dining habits by carefully scraping away the layers on an MCC member's jumper. Not, I should say, that the jumper is the product of slovenliness. Far from it. The garment serves an important purpose. The member knows that if ever food supplies run low he has simply to immerse his sweater in boiling water to produce a nutritious broth. It is not so much a pullover as knitted cup-a-soup (quite often complete with crunchy croutons). Under threat from the ever growing tyranny of style (many members have now abandoned baggy-crotched, straw-coloured corduroy trousers in favour of Blairite chinos) the MCC is now flaunting its colours like never before. The Lord's catalogue offers everything from button-down plaid shirts to boxer shorts in the characteristic septic-boil combo of yellow and red. There is a whole page of pyjamas and nightshirts. A little superfluous, perhaps, since it is clear from their rumpled appearance that most members sleep fully clothed. There is also a celebration of the heroic resistance in the museum. In one section on the first floor a little picnic tableau has been arranged. On the floor a rug is covered with a lavish picnic. Beside it on a fold-out chair sits a perfect waxwork of an elderly, moustachioed MCC member apparently in the act of falling asleep while munching a chicken drumstick. Well, at least I assume it was a waxwork.",

      "bodyText": "A glance at the scoreboard at Lord's would appear to vindicate the idea of central contracts, but do not mention this when there is a Tyke around. Although they have completed only two matches Yorkshire, with bonus points from this game, stand top of the First Division. Their total of 39 points from their opening two games, against Derbyshire and Hampshire at Headingley, was only one short of the maximum. So far so good. But there is a cloud on the horizon apart from the dark cumulus that was responsible for washing out all but 22.3 overs yesterday. They, like Lancashire, have had three players signed up by the England and Wales Cricket Board. But a look at the fixtures indicates that Yorkshire have fared worse than most when it comes to getting a chance to play their men in matches between tests. Both their wins were achieved while their three centrally contracted players, Darren Gough, Craig White and Michael Vaughan, were available. But that will happen on only one more occasion this season, when Yorkshire play Durham in June - and then only if the ECB decides to make those players available. The three should be free next week. But as Yorkshire will be playing Zimbabwe this will hardly help the county's quest for their first championship since 1968.

Both men wish nothing more than complete annihilation of their quarry, Lloyd most famously when he uttered the immortal phrase after a drawn Bulawayo test: \"We flippin' murdered 'em.\" </p> <p>If the Lord's rain showers become more prolonged, and Zimbabwe somehow contrive to save a game in which they have been thoroughly outplayed, Lloyd may develop a nasty case of Dreyfus Eye. His autobiography, Anything But Mur der, the publication of which coincides with the first test between these countries since Bulawayo, leaves no one in doubt how much he loathes the place. </p> <p>Tell it like it is, Bumble. Harare, according to Lloyd, \"is the pits\". Its people are \"inhospitable\", the capital city \"dangerous and tacky\".

      "bodyText": "Some of you may be under the naive impression that this match is entitled the first Cornhill test. You would be sadly misguided. It should properly be termed \"Bumble's Revenge\". And so far it is all going entirely to plan. For David Lloyd, a victory at Lord's would begin to soothe the resentment that has lingered ever since his involvement as England coach during a tour of Zimbabwe in 1996 which has gone down as one of the most lamentable in England's history. Zimbabwe have the same effect on Lloyd as Inspector Clouseau had on Chief Inspector Dreyfus. Both men wish nothing more than complete annihilation of their quarry, Lloyd most famously when he uttered the immortal phrase after a drawn Bulawayo test: \"We flippin' murdered 'em.\" If the Lord's rain showers become more prolonged, and Zimbabwe somehow contrive to save a game in which they have been thoroughly outplayed, Lloyd may develop a nasty case of Dreyfus Eye. His autobiography, Anything But Mur der, the publication of which coincides with the first test between these countries since Bulawayo, leaves no one in doubt how much he loathes the place. Tell it like it is, Bumble. Harare, according to Lloyd, \"is the pits\". Its people are \"inhospitable\", the capital city \"dangerous and tacky\". Some of its cricketers are little better, being guilty in Bulawayo, when they bowled wide and got away with it, of a \"shameful negativity\". Zimbabwe's cricketing public are also pilloried. Harare Sports Club, writes Lloyd, \"is home to a faction who represent the worst excesses of the old colonial empire. Their barstool conversation is frequently anti-English, harking back to UDI and the 1970s\". His disgust is most pronounced for the beer-swilling spectators in the \"outdated Colonial Club\", where he witnessed \"the demeaning process of black waiters having to pick up empty beer bottles thrown down by white spectators... like some long-forgotten racist ceremony\".

Journalists arriving for the club's Cup final week press day, dressed in the standard fashion-free manner of the profession, were all handed a pack marked \"Giorgio Armani\". In it were photographs of the squad wearing the Wembley outfits the Italian tailor had designed for them, three-button single-breasted suits in charcoal-grey wool, worn, according to the blurb, \"with light grey tone on tone shirt and tie combination\". </p> <p>Despite the best efforts of Graeme Le Saux, Frank Leboeuf and George Weah, no one wears the ensemble as well as the manager Gianluca Vialli. In one snap he is pictured in the dugout at Stamford Bridge with Dennis Wise and Armani himself (who, surprisingly for a designer reckoned to define the epicentre of cool, appears to be wearing a shellsuit). As Vialli grins through the promotional necessities of the modern football manager, he has his hand on Wise's knee, not exactly the traditional image of a manager facing a make-or-break crisis. </p> <p>Yet that is how today's match is being presented in sections of the press. Vialli, it is said, having spent the amount he has and with the squad at his disposal, simply must win. Not just to have a trophy to show for all his investment but to put his club back in the money-spinning business of serious European competition next season. </p> <p>Lose to Villa and his expensive collection of internationals will be obliged to reassemble immediately after Euro 2000 and begin the long haul of qualification through the Intertoto Cup. An outcome, the whispers have it, which could well mark an end to Vialli's 27 months in charge at Stamford Bridge. </p> <p>Vialli, of course, is keen that such talk should not become received opinion. Asked at the press day (where he had swapped Armani for Umbro) if defeat this afternoon would render his entire season a failure, he was quick to snap back. \"I will not answer that question,\" he said, his gaze significantly more steely than in those humble after-match appearances on television in his lucky Frank Spencer grey v-neck suggest. \"Whatever happens it is something to be proud of, to reach the last match of a long season and still have something to play for.\" </p> <p><strong> Anglophile</strong><br> </p> <p>Vialli has consistently challenged received opinion since he first came to England, signed by Ruud Gullit from Juventus in 1996. Back then it looked as if he would conform to the Carlos Kickaball model of the foreign player which obtained at the time: come to England just as your Italian career is beginning to fade, fill your boots with cash, then disappear after a season in search of the next big pay cheque complaining of Third World conditions; the path taken by his former strike partner in Turin, Fabrizio Ravanelli. </p> <p>But Vialli was not like that. From the moment he arrived, everything he did suggested he was in for the long haul. Far from being the fancy-dan foreigner found wanting when the weather turned or the opposition were keen to tattoo their initials on expensive shins, this most elegant of men seemed to take perverse pleasure in a good kicking. Chelsea fans remember the two goals he scored in six inches of comedy Norwegian snow against Tromso which kept the club in the Cup Winner's Cup two seasons ago; the brace in a January downpour at Oldham to maintain an FA Cup challenge; the relentless way he led the line in another Cup tie at Oxford. Even when Gullit gave him ample opportunity for a flounce by regularly humiliating him on the substitutes' bench (two minutes on the pitch is all he got the last time Chelsea were in the Cup final) he kept his counsel. </p> <p>His commitment was aided by the fact that, off the field, he loved living in London. He is a genuine anglophile. Perhaps as a consequence of his wealthy northern Italian background (his father, a leading industrialist, owns Castello Belgioioso, a 60-room pile outside Cremona) he has a penchant for the Sloanier, Barbour-clad elements of the English lifestyle. He has an apartment in a stucco-fronted terrace in Eaton Square rather than the footballer's standard-issue neo-Georgian mansion in Wentworth. He drives a Jaguar, not a Ferrari. He has such a playful affection for the English language that he likes to slip a new idiomatic phrase into every press conference. For some old-fashioned reason he considers us a nation of gentlemen. And he likes to behave like one, even to journalists. </p> <p>Maybe Ken Bates saw all this in him when he made Vialli manager after Gullit was summarily sacked in January 1998. Maybe Bates reckoned the personable, generous, popular Italian would defrost the glacial dressing-room atmosphere Gullit had engendered. To the watching world, however, it looked as if Chelsea had appointed a figurehead attracting old mates such as Pierluigi Casiraghi to come and play while Graham Rix got down to the tactical work. But if that ever was the plan, it was derailed by Rix's prison sentence. Vialli was alone in charge, and once more set about proving assumptions wrong. </p> <p>Despite his protests to the contrary the Italian is hard-pressed to deny that his year will ultimately be assessed on what happens today. As Gullit loftily put it this week, \"he has won nothing yet this season\". Watching Vialli's players train, the three World Cup winners, the former world player of the year, a classy Catalan here, a majestic Italian there, it is hard not to conclude that they will have under-achieved massively if they fail against Villa. Only Chris Sutton looks ill at ease in the company, shruggingly apologising when a group game of keepy-uppy ends with the ball scudding off his shin. </p> <p><strong> Desire</strong><br> </p> <p>There are hints in Vialli's recent pronouncements that, after enjoying the annual family holiday at the castello , he is preparing to change things in the close season. In his first few months he followed the Italian team-building model that Gullit had set in train: like a shopper on a spree in Emporio Armani, he bought quality off the peg: Casiraghi, Marcel Desailly, Albert Ferrer. A Cup Winners' Cup and League Cup had been won with the team Gullit built, but Vialli wanted more. In the Premiership his team were found wanting. Manchester United won the title because, unlike all their nearest challengers, they did not forget to win at Bradford. Chelsea lost not only at Valley Parade but at Watford too, the latter defeat between two draws with Milan. </p> <p>\"When we go to places like Sheffield Wednesday and Leicester we have to show more desire,\" Vialli admitted this week. So was it a desire deficit which had cost his club the title? </p> <p>\"When you play 60 matches in a year, subconsciously you prepare better for big matches,\" he said. \"It is not something you do on purpose, players try to be at their best all the time.\" </p> <p>Make of that what you will. Certainly there are clues at Stamford Bridge that he wants to develop his own talent rather than buying Armani-style. The club, he says, will return to a British core, perhaps led by the nine youth-system products who have been given a first-team run-out this season. Several of the club's thirtysomething stalwarts seem to have read the runes, acknowledging that this afternoon at Wembley may be a last hurrah. While Gianfranco Zola smilingly tried to deflect questions about his future, Leboeuf revealed that \"everyone is eager to come back in the summer - but whether it's Luca's choice is a different matter\". </p> <p>And Vialli seems to be gearing himself up for tough decisions. He has, after all, recently returned to a significant smoking habit. It will be hard. Until 18 months ago he was one of them, a team-mate of the lads who wore T-shirts saying \"Cheer up Luca\" when he was ignored by Gullit. Now he will have to say goodbye. </p> <p>\"I find it difficult not to have personal feelings,\" he said of the need to communicate bad news. \"But I find it easy to do what is right.\" </p> <p>The irony is that his biggest signing, the one he hoped would signal a younger, more British Chelsea, has been a resounding flop. Poor Chris Sutton. When a pressman tried to lighten his Eeyore countenance by suggesting the Cup final was his chance for vindication (\"Look at Teddy Sheringham last year!\"), he shrugged and muttered: \"I don't know if I'm starting yet. It's highly unlikely at the moment.\" </p> <p>In the end, Chelsea fans will be hoping that Sutton is just one of the \"mistakes\" Vialli refreshingly admits to making and not the kind of albatross that Stan Collymore, for instance, became for Brian Little at Aston Villa. While most Blues supporters would accept that a change of faces at Stamford Bridge is inevitable, it is Vialli they desperately want to be the man administering it. </p> <p>\"He is massively popular, particularly after Gullit who seemed to take delight in dropping crowd favourites,\" Jeremy Leslie, a Stamford Bridge regular, said. \"Bates knows it would be mad to get rid of him and I think that's why he made him do a lap of honour at the last home game, to show us he's behind him. People understand he's still learning, we are prepared to let him learn. After all, look how long it took Alex Ferguson to get it right.\" </p> <p>It is often forgotten that the manager is only 35, two years older than Wise, not someone to whom the adjective mature is often applied. He has never been afraid to admit he has much to learn. But learning on the job is rarely a luxury afforded to football managers. </p> <p>However relaxed the smiles this week, Gianluca Vialli knows that a few royal blue ribbons hanging from the FA Cup at five o'clock this afternoon will be the best guarantee he has of another course of lessons.</p>",

      "byline": "Ian Malin",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Six of Aston Villa's seven FA Cup triumphs belong to a sepia-tinted age but their last, in 1957, was captured on scratchy monochrome. And Johnny Dixon sits bare-chested in the Wembley dressing room speaking into the microphone of a fresh-faced David Coleman. </p> <p>\"I never thought it was possible but we had the run of the ball and it's turned our way. Possibly it's Manchester United's turn next year,\" says the affable, teetotal, non-smoking Geordie before showing off the cup to the BBC camera. </p> <p>\"Never mind, we'll be back to do it next year,\" United's captain Roger Byrne agrees later. They turned out to be tragically ironic words. Nine months later Byrne's life and those of seven of his team-mates on that sunny May day were cruelly snuffed out on a day of steady snow in Munich. </p> <p>As this year, Aston Villa were the underdogs in 1957. The 10th-placed team in the First Division were meeting the newly crowned champions, which meant that the Busby Babes at Wembley were aiming for the first double of the 20th century. United were packed with players fast becoming household names even outside Manchester: Bobby Charlton, Duncan Edwards, Tommy Taylor, Eddie Coleman. </p> <p>In his history of the FA Cup, Geoffrey Green says: \"Already champions of the league, all Manchester United had to do, it seemed, was to take the field, give one little puff at Aston Villa and the double was theirs.\" </p> <p>Forty-three years on from that cloudless afternoon, distant austere days when the Suez canal had just been opened again to shipping and Britain was still gripped by petrol rationing, the 76-year-old Dixon, who lives in Sutton Coldfield, remembers: \"United were a great side all right, there's no doubt about that, and we had just avoided relegation the season before. But we were playing with the confidence that winning can instil in a team. </p> <p>\"Eric Houghton was the manager and Bill Moore his assistant. Bill was a real taskmaster on the training ground but he knew when to use the stick and when to use the carrot. </p> <p>\"We weren't afraid of United but they were obviously going to be mightily difficult to beat. Then we had a team talk before we went down to Wembley and Bill says to us, 'Lads, there's one thing we've got to work out for Saturday and that's who's going to carry Johnny on their shoulders when he carries the cup around the stadium'. That eased the tension and we sensed that this was going to be our year.\" </p> <p>Peter McParland, the robust left-winger from the granite town of Newry, County Down, scored the goals that forged Villa's 2-1 victory but only after his early collision with Ray Wood, when the United goalkeeper's jaw was broken in a sickening crunch against the side of the Irishman's head. </p> <p>The legality of the challenge was the topic of many a saloon-bar conversation in Birmingham and Manchester for years afterwards but what cannot be denied is the shimmering brilliance of Villa's second-half goals. </p> <p>The first saw the inside-left Dixon swap wings and curl over a teasing right-foot cross that would make David Beckham proud and McParland steamed in to power the ball past the stand-in goalkeeper Jackie Blanchflower with a header from near the penalty spot. </p> <p>The second came when Dixon's shot cannoned off a post for McParland to fire home the rebound. Taylor's late header failed to prevent the cup going to Villa Park for a then-record seventh time. </p> <p>Dixon was the archetypal post-war footballer. Born in Newcastle, apprenticed as an electrical engineer, he played factory football at weekends before being signed as an amateur by Newcastle United. But in the 1946-47 season, when Villa paid a then-massive \u00a39,500 for Swansea's Wales centre-forward Trevor Ford, Newcastle let Villa have Dixon for \u00a315. </p> <p>Those were the days before the abolition of the maximum wage.

      "bodyText": "Six of Aston Villa's seven FA Cup triumphs belong to a sepia-tinted age but their last, in 1957, was captured on scratchy monochrome. And Johnny Dixon sits bare-chested in the Wembley dressing room speaking into the microphone of a fresh-faced David Coleman. \"I never thought it was possible but we had the run of the ball and it's turned our way. Possibly it's Manchester United's turn next year,\" says the affable, teetotal, non-smoking Geordie before showing off the cup to the BBC camera. \"Never mind, we'll be back to do it next year,\" United's captain Roger Byrne agrees later. They turned out to be tragically ironic words. Nine months later Byrne's life and those of seven of his team-mates on that sunny May day were cruelly snuffed out on a day of steady snow in Munich. As this year, Aston Villa were the underdogs in 1957. The 10th-placed team in the First Division were meeting the newly crowned champions, which meant that the Busby Babes at Wembley were aiming for the first double of the 20th century. United were packed with players fast becoming household names even outside Manchester: Bobby Charlton, Duncan Edwards, Tommy Taylor, Eddie Coleman. In his history of the FA Cup, Geoffrey Green says: \"Already champions of the league, all Manchester United had to do, it seemed, was to take the field, give one little puff at Aston Villa and the double was theirs.\" Forty-three years on from that cloudless afternoon, distant austere days when the Suez canal had just been opened again to shipping and Britain was still gripped by petrol rationing, the 76-year-old Dixon, who lives in Sutton Coldfield, remembers: \"United were a great side all right, there's no doubt about that, and we had just avoided relegation the season before. But we were playing with the confidence that winning can instil in a team. \"Eric Houghton was the manager and Bill Moore his assistant. Bill was a real taskmaster on the training ground but he knew when to use the stick and when to use the carrot. \"We weren't afraid of United but they were obviously going to be mightily difficult to beat. Then we had a team talk before we went down to Wembley and Bill says to us, 'Lads, there's one thing we've got to work out for Saturday and that's who's going to carry Johnny on their shoulders when he carries the cup around the stadium'. That eased the tension and we sensed that this was going to be our year.\" Peter McParland, the robust left-winger from the granite town of Newry, County Down, scored the goals that forged Villa's 2-1 victory but only after his early collision with Ray Wood, when the United goalkeeper's jaw was broken in a sickening crunch against the side of the Irishman's head. The legality of the challenge was the topic of many a saloon-bar conversation in Birmingham and Manchester for years afterwards but what cannot be denied is the shimmering brilliance of Villa's second-half goals. The first saw the inside-left Dixon swap wings and curl over a teasing right-foot cross that would make David Beckham proud and McParland steamed in to power the ball past the stand-in goalkeeper Jackie Blanchflower with a header from near the penalty spot. The second came when Dixon's shot cannoned off a post for McParland to fire home the rebound. Taylor's late header failed to prevent the cup going to Villa Park for a then-record seventh time. Dixon was the archetypal post-war footballer. Born in Newcastle, apprenticed as an electrical engineer, he played factory football at weekends before being signed as an amateur by Newcastle United. But in the 1946-47 season, when Villa paid a then-massive \u00a39,500 for Swansea's Wales centre-forward Trevor Ford, Newcastle let Villa have Dixon for \u00a315. Those were the days before the abolition of the maximum wage. Dixon and his team-mates may have played to colossal crowds, banks of Park Drive-puffing men in flat caps, but he says: \"The most I got was \u00a324 a week and \u00a322 in the summer. We got \u00a32 for a win and \u00a31 for a draw . . . and \u00a3100 for winning the cup.\" But at least he has fared better than some of his Wembley team-mates, men such as the hard-up full-back Stan Lynn, \"Stan the Wham\" of unstoppable penalty-kick fame, who has been forced to sell his winner's medal. Dixon still has his and he will be at Wembley today as a Villa guest in his new jacket to relive sunlit memories. \"The thing that stays in my mind was a moment a couple of minutes before the end when the ball had gone out of play. I looked up at the royal box where the cup gleamed in the sunlight. Minutes later I was climbing those 39 steps. At that moment I was on top of the world.\"",

      "byline": "John Quinn",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A ride really is paradise: a lush emerald island surrounded by powdery white beaches, set in azure-blue clear waters and populated by a handful of people, a million sea birds and all sorts of exotic creatures. It is perhaps the finest example in the Indian Ocean, easily accessible yet unspoilt. </p> <p>As a volunteer warden on the nature reserve of Aride Island, the only problem was finding time to do nothing after taking care of the wildlife, the visitors and ourselves. </p> <p> <strong> Wildlife</strong> </p> <p> There are birds everywhere. Sooty terns mill in their thousands. Washing in the morning, you can watch white-tailed tropicbirds feed their ravenous chicks. Evening dinner on the veranda is often rudely interrupted by a confused Audubon's shearwater crash-landing into the rice pan. Seychelles blue pigeons coo from the tree tops. At night you are lulled to sleep by chattering noddies in the heavily-scented trees. </p> <p>Getting up in the mornings from our humble chalets by the beach was effortless. We - that's me and five fellow biologists - knew the skies would be blue and the temperature a comfortable 30C. </p> <p>Our first duty of the day was to search the beach for telltale tracks of nesting hawksbill or green turtles. Sometimes we were lucky and found one laying her clutch of more than 100 eggs above the crest of the beach. Awkward on land, turtles in the water are swift and graceful. To see a 50kg green turtle munching away on coral rock is unforgettable and not rare when snorkelling in the Seychelles. </p> <p>In any one year, more than a million sea birds from 10 species nest on Aride. Trying to count and see how well they breed is challenging - counting noddy chicks in their seaweed nests high in the trees was a pain in the neck. The nocturnal shearwaters posed other problems - nesting in burrows. </p> <p>The sustained contact with the birds was the most rewarding aspect of island life. But it could also be harrowing. Scores of young and adult birds became entangled in the sticky seeds of the pisonia tree - leading to their deaths. Precarious fairy tern eggs fell off branches. In some years, most of the island's sea birds fail to raise young because there are too few fish. As a biologist, I knew it should have been of consolation that this was (usually) only natural. </p> <p> <strong> Victuals</strong> </p> <p> Watching hungry chicks being fed was usually enough to send us in search of our own lunch. Once a week, we took the inflatable to Praslin, 10km away, to get supplies. My shopping list became smaller as I learned to use the island's natural produce. Most Seychellois are expert fishermen - my colleagues were no exception. Barracuda, bonito or jackfish were trawled from a fast-moving boat or baited bamboo traps were left beyond the reef. On one occasion it took steady nerves to remove a 4ft moray eel from among the catch. Fresh barbecued swordfish, jackfish or tuna in a chilli, garlic and ginger marinade is exquisite. The Seychellois look exceptionally healthy, no doubt because they eat fish daily. </p> <p>There were plenty of fruits and vegetables to use on the island, as the fruit bats hanging in the trees knew well. One day, I caught a blue pigeon tottering on a branch, after it had become drunk from eating over-ripe papaya. He took two days and large quantities of water to recover. </p> <p>Try this recipe: fry grated papaya (unripe) with onion, ginger and garlic until soft, and season. </p> <p>Citrus fruits grew in abundance. I'm convinced limes were originally planted on Aride so that gin and tonics could be sipped on the beach while watching the sunset. Wading into the marsh to gather the spinach-like bred le mar was well worth the soaking. The coco yam made delicious deep-fried chips. Milk from grated coconut flesh took forever to extract but the fish curry that followed was worth it the effort. </p> <p>On our desert island, everything took a long time. Our only mod cons were solar-powered fridges, lights and gas cookers. Water had to be taken from a well and boiled before drinking, and a bucket improvised as a shower. But somehow this grafting to provide the bare necessities was enormously satisfying. </p> <p> <strong> Visitors</strong> </p> <p> There was always excitement when tourists arrived. It took all six of us to launch the rubber boat we used to collect visitors from the boats moored beyond the reef. During the south-easterly trade winds from April to October, it can be too rough to land. </p> <p>My Seychellois colleagues take pride in pointing out plants found nowhere else in the world. The piratical frigatebirds who steal fish from sooty terns are also a favourite. </p> <p>You learn of the island's colonial history and see excavations where occupants searched for treasure rumoured to have been stashed by pirates such as Long John Avery and Captain Kidd. There is a memorial to Christopher Cadbury, of the chocolate family, who bought Aride in the 1970s on the advice of his friend, Sir Peter Scott, thereby safeguarding its future. </p> <p>After the tour, we would enjoy a delicious barbecue before the visitors went snorkelling on the reef. The huge diversity of fish can lead to serious sensory overload. In 20 minutes on Aride's coral reef, you can easily see more than 100 fish species of a dazzling variety - blue-lipped sweetlips, boxfish, emperors and angelfish. </p> <p> <strong> Elsewhere</strong> </p> <p> You can stay overnight on other nature reserve islands such as Cousine and Bird Island, although these are expensive. But there are many other places to visit. </p> <p>Hike up Morne Seychellois on Mah\u00e9 for spectacular views of the islands. Visit the prehistoric forests in Vall\u00e9e de Mai on Praslin to see the mystical coco de mer tree fern. Relish the cuisine and befriend the locals, most of whom are of African or Asian origin. Nearly all islands have idyllic, practically deserted beaches, but those on sleepy La Digue, where that Bounty Bar ad was filmed, are probably the best. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>To volunteer for three months on Aride, write to Aride Information, The Wildlife Trusts, The Kiln, Waterside, Mather Road, Newark NG24 1WT. Tourists cannot stay over night, but day trips between October and April cost about \u00a340 from nearby Praslin. Yachts can also land at Aride (\u00a310 per person); contact the island by radio or phone (00248 321600). Flights to the Seychelles start at \u00a3550.Contact Alignspeed (01293 596660), Seychelles Travel (01258 450983) or the Seychelles Tourist Board (020 7224 1670). Travel between and on islands is easy and inexpensive.

      "bodyText": "A ride really is paradise: a lush emerald island surrounded by powdery white beaches, set in azure-blue clear waters and populated by a handful of people, a million sea birds and all sorts of exotic creatures. It is perhaps the finest example in the Indian Ocean, easily accessible yet unspoilt. As a volunteer warden on the nature reserve of Aride Island, the only problem was finding time to do nothing after taking care of the wildlife, the visitors and ourselves. Wildlife There are birds everywhere. Sooty terns mill in their thousands. Washing in the morning, you can watch white-tailed tropicbirds feed their ravenous chicks. Evening dinner on the veranda is often rudely interrupted by a confused Audubon's shearwater crash-landing into the rice pan. Seychelles blue pigeons coo from the tree tops. At night you are lulled to sleep by chattering noddies in the heavily-scented trees. Getting up in the mornings from our humble chalets by the beach was effortless. We - that's me and five fellow biologists - knew the skies would be blue and the temperature a comfortable 30C. Our first duty of the day was to search the beach for telltale tracks of nesting hawksbill or green turtles. Sometimes we were lucky and found one laying her clutch of more than 100 eggs above the crest of the beach. Awkward on land, turtles in the water are swift and graceful. To see a 50kg green turtle munching away on coral rock is unforgettable and not rare when snorkelling in the Seychelles. In any one year, more than a million sea birds from 10 species nest on Aride. Trying to count and see how well they breed is challenging - counting noddy chicks in their seaweed nests high in the trees was a pain in the neck. The nocturnal shearwaters posed other problems - nesting in burrows. The sustained contact with the birds was the most rewarding aspect of island life. But it could also be harrowing. Scores of young and adult birds became entangled in the sticky seeds of the pisonia tree - leading to their deaths. Precarious fairy tern eggs fell off branches. In some years, most of the island's sea birds fail to raise young because there are too few fish. As a biologist, I knew it should have been of consolation that this was (usually) only natural. Victuals Watching hungry chicks being fed was usually enough to send us in search of our own lunch. Once a week, we took the inflatable to Praslin, 10km away, to get supplies. My shopping list became smaller as I learned to use the island's natural produce. Most Seychellois are expert fishermen - my colleagues were no exception. Barracuda, bonito or jackfish were trawled from a fast-moving boat or baited bamboo traps were left beyond the reef. On one occasion it took steady nerves to remove a 4ft moray eel from among the catch. Fresh barbecued swordfish, jackfish or tuna in a chilli, garlic and ginger marinade is exquisite. The Seychellois look exceptionally healthy, no doubt because they eat fish daily. There were plenty of fruits and vegetables to use on the island, as the fruit bats hanging in the trees knew well. One day, I caught a blue pigeon tottering on a branch, after it had become drunk from eating over-ripe papaya. He took two days and large quantities of water to recover. Try this recipe: fry grated papaya (unripe) with onion, ginger and garlic until soft, and season. Citrus fruits grew in abundance. I'm convinced limes were originally planted on Aride so that gin and tonics could be sipped on the beach while watching the sunset. Wading into the marsh to gather the spinach-like bred le mar was well worth the soaking. The coco yam made delicious deep-fried chips. Milk from grated coconut flesh took forever to extract but the fish curry that followed was worth it the effort. On our desert island, everything took a long time. Our only mod cons were solar-powered fridges, lights and gas cookers. Water had to be taken from a well and boiled before drinking, and a bucket improvised as a shower. But somehow this grafting to provide the bare necessities was enormously satisfying. Visitors There was always excitement when tourists arrived. It took all six of us to launch the rubber boat we used to collect visitors from the boats moored beyond the reef. During the south-easterly trade winds from April to October, it can be too rough to land. My Seychellois colleagues take pride in pointing out plants found nowhere else in the world. The piratical frigatebirds who steal fish from sooty terns are also a favourite. You learn of the island's colonial history and see excavations where occupants searched for treasure rumoured to have been stashed by pirates such as Long John Avery and Captain Kidd. There is a memorial to Christopher Cadbury, of the chocolate family, who bought Aride in the 1970s on the advice of his friend, Sir Peter Scott, thereby safeguarding its future. After the tour, we would enjoy a delicious barbecue before the visitors went snorkelling on the reef. The huge diversity of fish can lead to serious sensory overload. In 20 minutes on Aride's coral reef, you can easily see more than 100 fish species of a dazzling variety - blue-lipped sweetlips, boxfish, emperors and angelfish. Elsewhere You can stay overnight on other nature reserve islands such as Cousine and Bird Island, although these are expensive. But there are many other places to visit. Hike up Morne Seychellois on Mah\u00e9 for spectacular views of the islands. Visit the prehistoric forests in Vall\u00e9e de Mai on Praslin to see the mystical coco de mer tree fern. Relish the cuisine and befriend the locals, most of whom are of African or Asian origin. Nearly all islands have idyllic, practically deserted beaches, but those on sleepy La Digue, where that Bounty Bar ad was filmed, are probably the best. The practicals To volunteer for three months on Aride, write to Aride Information, The Wildlife Trusts, The Kiln, Waterside, Mather Road, Newark NG24 1WT. Tourists cannot stay over night, but day trips between October and April cost about \u00a340 from nearby Praslin. Yachts can also land at Aride (\u00a310 per person); contact the island by radio or phone (00248 321600). Flights to the Seychelles start at \u00a3550.Contact Alignspeed (01293 596660), Seychelles Travel (01258 450983) or the Seychelles Tourist Board (020 7224 1670). Travel between and on islands is easy and inexpensive. Other useful websites: www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/se.html, www.sey.net and www.seychelles-travel.co.uk.",

      "body": "<p>A plan of attack was needed. I collected advice, studied maps, made lists and drew up a plan that was supposed to lead me seamlessly from one shop to another. I learnt that most of the good shops fitted into two areas that allowed you to see a respectable portion of Paris, including a few of the tourist sights. </p> <p><strong> Day 1</strong><br> <strong> Starting point: </strong> Arc de Triomphe </p> <p> It was unfortunate that the first thing I picked up was the cheese because it smelt but no cheese lover could resist the delights of Androuet, tucked just off the Champs Elys\u00e9es near the Arc de Triomphe (6, Rue Arsene Houssaye). It's one of the best cheese shops in Paris; the cheeses are matured in cellars on the premises, and you can try the cheesy menu in the restaurant. After much rapturous sniffing, I settled on a selection including a beautiful Reblochon and a ripe Pont-l'\u00e9v que. </p> <p>Next were the celebrated wine cellars of Taillevent, (199 Rue de Faubourg St Honor\u00e9). If you go back to the Arc de Triomphe, and walk up Avenue Hoche, it will take you to the right part of this very long road. Les Caves Taillevent stock thousands of wines from all over France, and sommeliers are on hand to help out. The room is decorated with empty bottles drunk by luminaries - a 1953 Fourcaud-Laussac drunk by Salvador Dali in 1976, a 1934 Grand Vin de L\u00e9oville drunk by Richard Nixon in 1986, and a 1934 Chateau Haut-Brion drunk by Charles de Gaulle in 1961. After a tour of the large cellars, I took the sommelier's word for it and chose Taillevent's selection of Bordeaux, which was then thankfully delivered to where I was staying. </p> <p>On the long walk east down Rue St Honor\u00e9, which runs parallel to the Champs Elys\u00e9es, I passed a lot of top clothes shops and big labels, including Fa\u00e7onnable - stylish casual shirts for FFr600-800 (there are around 10.8 francs to the pound) - and Herm\u00e8s, home of the classic silk scarf at FFr1,460. With the current strong pound this works out at almost a bargain, around \u00a323 cheaper than the London price of \u00a3160. But I pressed on to my slightly less glam destination, Au Nain Bleu, (406 Rue St Honor\u00e9), the toy shop to end toy shops. They sell the kind of toys that grown-ups prefer to have littered around their living rooms- smart painted wooden toys and games. My niece was soon sorted out with some beautiful doll's house furniture, and I carried on towards Place de la Madeleine. </p> <p>Place de la Madeleine is more famous for its food shops than it is for its grand classical temple, La Madeleine. Paris's most lavish delicatessens guard the square, offering goodies for the extravagant gourmet. I was put off the truffles at the Maison de la Truffe by the inflated price of FFr290-496 for a mere 25g, but for a wider range of products - the widest - Fauchon is unmissable. It will sell you anything from raspberry pepper sweets (FFr39) to Roquefort mustard (FFr25) or Earl Grey jelly (FFr35); there are hundreds of products you didn't even know existed, let alone know you wanted. </p> <p>By this stage, I'd been looking at food all morning without eating a thing, so went next door to the Salon de Th\u00e9 Fauchon, for a terribly refined late morning morsel. From the selection of patisseries, I chose a Traviata Framboise. It was a raspberry and almond cream delight that tasted like it had fallen from an angel's table. Washed down with tea chosen from an array of special blends and infusions (caramel tea anyone? Or green apple?) it made for a luxurious elevenses. </p> <p>Feeling the urge for a little peace and greenery, I wandered down to the Place de la Concorde and through the long avenues of the Jardin des Tuileries towards the Louvre before turning off towards the busy high street shopping area of Les Halles. This is a fun place, with crowds of young faces, buskers and street performers and a buzzing atmosphere, but the shops turned out to be disappointingly like shops on any good high street in England. It was clearly a foodie day, because heading east along Rue de la Verrerie, I came across A l'Olivier (23 Rue de Rivoli) near metro St Paul, where they stock an impressive range of olive oils: peanut, corn, chilli, tarragon and truffle. The thoroughbred of oils is the unfiltered extra virgin olive oil from the Vall\u00e9e du Paillon at FFr95 for 50cl, but I came away with a small selection of fennel, lemon, and herb. </p> <p>Tired and footsore, I headed towards the elegant lawns and shady benches of the Place des Vosges; I'd seen the Arc de Triomphe, the Champs Elys\u00e9es, the Madeleine, the Jardin des Tuileries, Les Halles and the Place des Vosges, as well as some of Paris' finest shops. I took the metro back west for a sundowner at Le Totem, the bar restaurant in the Palais de Chaillot that looks across the river at the Eiffel Tower. Not as touristy as you might think, this terrace at the top of the Trocad\u00e9ro gardens turned out to be the perfect place for a cold beer at the end of a hard day. </p> <p><strong> Day 2</strong><br> <strong> Starting point:</strong> Boulevard St Germain </p> <p> Having explored the Right Bank, it was time for the Rive Gauche. I took the metro to Solf\u00e9rino, at the eastern end of Boulevard St Germain, so that I could work my way down without doubling back on myself. I soon discovered, though, that as with the Champs Elys\u00e9es, the best places were actually off the famous road. Apart, that is, from Richart (258 Bvd St Germain, by Solf\u00e9rino metro), which sells astonishingly artistic chocolates. </p> <p>I had promised myself this wouldn't be a foodie day, but a box of these miniature works of art was a perfect house gift for my host. They have a very distinctive style, in particular the square chocolates hand painted with patterns and delicate pictures (FFr105 for 16). I chose a box with each chocolate decorated differently with little people - too beautiful to eat. </p> <p>Walking west down Boulevard St Germain, I turned right on to Rue St Peres - a good move for the fashion conscious. Capucine Puerai (62 Rue St Peres) sells a small but elegant range of dresses and suits with simple, clean lines at FFr800-1,800. I escaped from the shop with one little white dress only to be sucked in by its neighbour and sartorial opposite, the decadent and glamorous Shad\u00e9. The main stock was in accessories - fantastic glam jewellery from FFr500-1,000, jewelled chokers and gaudy rings, wonderful scarves and mad hats. I settled on a sparkling choker for those dressier nights out. </p> <p>Ask any chic Parisian where to go for lingerie, and she will say Sabbia Rosa, where you can find silk underwear of every form and colour, from the demure to the outrageous. Fortunately, it is just down the road from Shad\u00e9, still on Rue St Peres, so I popped in to admire the great armfuls of softest silk on display. A short camisole goes for FFr1,200, but it's not the same if you buy it yourself. </p> <p> Just down the road, at the junction with Rue de Grenelle, you can find Prada, YSL and other top labels for those with astronomical budgets. This is the Latin Quarter, and it is a good place to come to buy presents - the Galeries D'Amon on Rue St Sulpice sells beautiful blown glass bottles and vases from FFr450 up, and at Cir, a few doors down, you can buy candles of every shape, size and style, including a gold replica of the Eiffel Tower which was too kitsch to be missed. There is something around every corner, so it's worth taking time to explore. </p> <p>On my second day, I had managed to explore a fair chunk of the Left Bank, my bank account was empty, my shopping bags full, and my head spinning. It had got to the stage where all judgment had been lost and I had gone credit-card crazy. </p> <p>But temptation was not far away, in the shape of one of Paris' trendier restaurants, Spoon. Here they have broken down the traditional style of menu into its component parts, and leave it up to you how you want to reassemble it. You choose the basic elements you want - say, cod - and then which of the available ways you want it done - say, roast with citrus jam. Every element of the menu is presented with a range of possibilities. If you are feeling daring, you could start with dessert, or have your hors d'oeuvre with chips. </p> <p>Everything's on offer, and what you pick is entirely up to you. Just like shopping, only easier on the feet.</p> <p><strong>Anna's bag </strong></p> <p><strong>Androuet:</strong> large Reblochon (490g) FFr69, a whole Pont-l'\u00e9v que (400g) FFr46. </p> <p><strong> Taillevent:</strong> a boxed selection of six Bordeaux FFr420, plus FFr60 for local delivery. </p> <p><strong> Au Nain Bleu:</strong> Living-room set for dolls' house, FFr200. </p> <p><strong> Salon de Th\u00e9 Fauchon:</strong> Patisserie FFr45, tea FFr40. </p> <p><strong> A l'Olivier:</strong> three flavoured olive oils at FFr37 each. </p> <p><strong> Richart:</strong> FFr105 for a box of 16 chocolates. </p> <p><strong> Capucine Puerai:</strong> dress FFr1,200. </p> <p><strong> Shad\u00e9:</strong> choker FFr550. </p> <p><strong> Cir:</strong> Eiffel tower candle, FFr55. </p> <p><strong> Total: </strong> FFr2,901 (\u00a3268.61) </p> <p>\u0095 A strike that has led to ATM machines in France being empty of money continued this week.

It was clearly a foodie day, because heading east along Rue de la Verrerie, I came across A l'Olivier (23 Rue de Rivoli) near metro St Paul, where they stock an impressive range of olive oils: peanut, corn, chilli, tarragon and truffle. The thoroughbred of oils is the unfiltered extra virgin olive oil from the Vall\u00e9e du Paillon at FFr95 for 50cl, but I came away with a small selection of fennel, lemon, and herb. Tired and footsore, I headed towards the elegant lawns and shady benches of the Place des Vosges; I'd seen the Arc de Triomphe, the Champs Elys\u00e9es, the Madeleine, the Jardin des Tuileries, Les Halles and the Place des Vosges, as well as some of Paris' finest shops. I took the metro back west for a sundowner at Le Totem, the bar restaurant in the Palais de Chaillot that looks across the river at the Eiffel Tower. Not as touristy as you might think, this terrace at the top of the Trocad\u00e9ro gardens turned out to be the perfect place for a cold beer at the end of a hard day. Day 2 Starting point: Boulevard St Germain Having explored the Right Bank, it was time for the Rive Gauche. I took the metro to Solf\u00e9rino, at the eastern end of Boulevard St Germain, so that I could work my way down without doubling back on myself. I soon discovered, though, that as with the Champs Elys\u00e9es, the best places were actually off the famous road. Apart, that is, from Richart (258 Bvd St Germain, by Solf\u00e9rino metro), which sells astonishingly artistic chocolates. I had promised myself this wouldn't be a foodie day, but a box of these miniature works of art was a perfect house gift for my host. They have a very distinctive style, in particular the square chocolates hand painted with patterns and delicate pictures (FFr105 for 16). I chose a box with each chocolate decorated differently with little people - too beautiful to eat. Walking west down Boulevard St Germain, I turned right on to Rue St Peres - a good move for the fashion conscious. Capucine Puerai (62 Rue St Peres) sells a small but elegant range of dresses and suits with simple, clean lines at FFr800-1,800. I escaped from the shop with one little white dress only to be sucked in by its neighbour and sartorial opposite, the decadent and glamorous Shad\u00e9. The main stock was in accessories - fantastic glam jewellery from FFr500-1,000, jewelled chokers and gaudy rings, wonderful scarves and mad hats. I settled on a sparkling choker for those dressier nights out. Ask any chic Parisian where to go for lingerie, and she will say Sabbia Rosa, where you can find silk underwear of every form and colour, from the demure to the outrageous. Fortunately, it is just down the road from Shad\u00e9, still on Rue St Peres, so I popped in to admire the great armfuls of softest silk on display. A short camisole goes for FFr1,200, but it's not the same if you buy it yourself. Just down the road, at the junction with Rue de Grenelle, you can find Prada, YSL and other top labels for those with astronomical budgets. This is the Latin Quarter, and it is a good place to come to buy presents - the Galeries D'Amon on Rue St Sulpice sells beautiful blown glass bottles and vases from FFr450 up, and at Cir, a few doors down, you can buy candles of every shape, size and style, including a gold replica of the Eiffel Tower which was too kitsch to be missed. There is something around every corner, so it's worth taking time to explore. On my second day, I had managed to explore a fair chunk of the Left Bank, my bank account was empty, my shopping bags full, and my head spinning. It had got to the stage where all judgment had been lost and I had gone credit-card crazy. But temptation was not far away, in the shape of one of Paris' trendier restaurants, Spoon. Here they have broken down the traditional style of menu into its component parts, and leave it up to you how you want to reassemble it. You choose the basic elements you want - say, cod - and then which of the available ways you want it done - say, roast with citrus jam. Every element of the menu is presented with a range of possibilities. If you are feeling daring, you could start with dessert, or have your hors d'oeuvre with chips. Everything's on offer, and what you pick is entirely up to you. Just like shopping, only easier on the feet. Anna's bag Androuet: large Reblochon (490g) FFr69, a whole Pont-l'\u00e9v que (400g) FFr46. Taillevent: a boxed selection of six Bordeaux FFr420, plus FFr60 for local delivery. Au Nain Bleu: Living-room set for dolls' house, FFr200. Salon de Th\u00e9 Fauchon: Patisserie FFr45, tea FFr40. A l'Olivier: three flavoured olive oils at FFr37 each. Richart: FFr105 for a box of 16 chocolates. Capucine Puerai: dress FFr1,200. Shad\u00e9: choker FFr550. Cir: Eiffel tower candle, FFr55. Total: FFr2,901 (\u00a3268.61) \u0095 A strike that has led to ATM machines in France being empty of money continued this week. Stores have lowered their credit-card minimum purchase and official advice is to take more French francs with you for incidentals.",

      "body": "<p>'I've always called LA the world capital of sport,\" says Tommy Lasorda, senior vice-president of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who won two world baseball series when he was the team' manager from 1976 to 1998. That's world series, mind, even though only American and Canadian teams compete. </p> <p>The Hall of Famer and \"baseball's most popular ambassador\" may very wellhave a case for championing his city over the likes of London or New York for the world sporting crown, though. For when Angelenos are not worshipping at the outdoor altar of health and fitness - flinging their bronzed bodies about a beach volleyball court, say, in Santa Monica, or surfing the breaks at Zuma, rollerblading along Venice's Ocean Front Walk or maybe pumping up their pneumatic pecs at Muscle Beach - they like nothing better than to cheer on others in the pursuit of athletic excellence. </p> <p>The conditions are, of course, perfect for competitors and spectators alike: great weather, glorious west-coast setting and stadia that are out of this world. </p> <p>In the land of plenty, LA can be seen toenjoy an embarrassment of riches. The Dodgers outgrew their birthplace of Brooklyn and moved west for richer pickings in 1958. The LA Lakers relocated from Minnesota in 1960, have since won six basketball world championships, and in Magic Johnson had one of the greatest players in NBA history. The LA Kings have yet to lift ice hockey's Stanley Cup, but the team had Wayne Gretzky, known as The Great One, from the late 80s to early 90s. And, in a country where the car is still king, there's the Long Beach Grand Prix to keep the petrol heads happy. Each of these is a blockbuster franchise with Hollywood production values, budgets and box-office stars to match. </p> <p>Sports addicts who time it right can drift from one field of dreams to another over the space of a long weekend. In early April, the Lakers were putting the finishing touches to their West Conference-winning season before entering the play-offs for the NBA championships; the Dodgers were pitching their first home series of the millennium against the Cincinnati Reds; and Long Beach was waving the chequered flag on its 26th Grand Prix. Sadly, I couldn't stick around to catch the Kings' opening home play-off game against the Detroit Redwings. But ow there's an excuse to go back next April. </p> <p><strong> The hoops</strong><br> Friday 7.30pm: LA Lakers versus Sacramento Kings </p> <p> The setting for tonight's hoop dreams is a $375 million, futuristic-lookingstadium in downtown LA, which opened last October. \"Uniquely LA\" is how Dan Meis, of architects NBBJ, describes his company's all-glass and metal creation. From the outside, it looks like a giant, glowing hockey puck at full til (it is also home to the KIngs as well as the Clippers, LA's other NBA franchise). Inside, the seating presses down on the varnished wooden court, making it appear way too small a stage for the world's tallest athletes. Even from a distance, you feel close to the action. But not as close as those who, like Jack Nicholson, pay $1,150 to be on top of it in thefloorside seats. </p> <p>\"Welcome to the Staples Center, the sports and entertainment centre of the world,\" says the public announcer. </p> <p>The world capital. The world champions. The world's biggest. Out of this world. There's reallyno place left to go from here, other than the centre of the universe. Americans are not ones for selling themselves short, but they sureknow how to put on a good show. Especially in Tinseltown. </p> <p>Before the action starts, there's the singing of the Star-Spangled Banner, the last time the 18,997-seater venue will stand still for the next two-and-a-half hours. The teams enter to strobe lights and disco music; the all-dancing Laker Girls distract the crowd between time-outs; vendors walk between the aisles handing out peanuts, burgers, hot dogs and even Pizza Hut boxes; the man sitting in the lucky seat number wins a year's subscription to Cigar Aficionado; \"When I say Lakers, you say go!\" </p> <p>On court, in the land of the giants, there is aa Goliath whodominates the game and the eye. \"A great physical specimen,\" is how film director Spike Lee describes Shaquille O'Neal in his basketball book, Best Seat in the House. At 7ft 1in and weighing 22 1/2 stone, the Lakers centre is a massive talent, dwarfing the other players who attempt to pirouette and fly past him. While the 6ft somethings circling the basket have tomake at least a token leap when they plop their shots through the hoop, Shaq's size 21 sneakers barely leave the ground as he twists and nonchalantly flicks the ball up and over the rim. </p> <p>Basketball is a fast and graceful game, even if Shaq appears to lumber unhurriedly between defence and attack. At the end,the Lakers run out winners by 121 points to 114 (Shaq has scored 41 of them). That's a lot of baskets for your average $40 seat price - and, in between, we've had an indoor fireworks display, break-dancing and a rapper singing \"We can get it on\". </p> <p> <strong> Celebrity spots: </strong> Pete Sampras and Garry Shandling. <br> <strong> Price of a huge flame-grilled burger: </strong> $7.50. <br> <strong> Price of a beer: </strong> $5. <br> <strong> Price of a replica Shaq shirt, number 34:</strong> $150. <br> <strong> Regular basketball season:</strong> runs from November to April.<br> <strong> Regular ticket prices: </strong> $10-$150.<br> <strong> Where: </strong> Staples Center, 1111 South Figueroa.<br> <strong> Box office tel: </strong> (213) 742 7340710, <a href=\"http://www.staplescenter.com\">www.staplescenter.com</a> </p> <p><strong> The ball game</strong><br> Saturday 5.15pm: LA Dodgers versus Cincinatti Reds</p> <p> Sports fans arriving at Dodgers Stadium must feel as though they have just died andarrived in heaven. Address: Elysian Park Avenue. Setting: on a hill overlooking downtown LA to the south, tree-lined Elysian hills to the north and east and the San Gabriel mountains beyond. Overhead: puffy white clouds in a cobalt-blue sky. There are even a couple of palm trees at the pavilion end, for Pete's sake. Or did I just dream that along with the chorus of angels? </p> <p>I didn't imagine that hallowed diamond, though. Pure manicured magic, all 100,000sq ft of the dazzling Bermuda grass and sand. </p> <p>If you build it, they will come.In the late 1950s, Brooklyn Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley had a dream to build a more modernball park for his Brooklyn Dodgers. New York couldn't come up with a site, so he moved them to LA. Simple economics. By 1962, the LA Dodgers had a 56,000-seater home, where they beat theCincinatti Reds 6-2 in their opening game on April 10. </p> <p>Thirty-eight years later almost to the day, the Dodgers are onceagain pitted against the Reds in their opening home series at Dodgers Stadiu. (They win the first game 8-1, but willlose this one 5-4). In the close season, the fifth oldes venue in baseballhas had a $50-million facelift, adding 35 luxury suites at $125,000 to $300,000 a season and nine rows of padded seats behind the home plate ($195-$250) to cater for the Hollywood set. More than half the seats in the stadium, though, are still available for $6. </p> <p>Since 1962, players' wages have gone through the roof,of course, and there have been ugly strikes and shut-outs down the year. But much about the game has reassuringly staye the same: the rules, the old-fashioned looking uniforms, the tradition of the seventh-inning stretch - when everybody stands up and sings \"Take me out to the ball game . . .\" - and the vendors holding up cotton candy and boxes of Crackerjack popcorn. </p> <p>Baseball is about as downhomey as it gets, a completecontrast to the rap-influenced, tattooed, blazinginner-city world of basketball. Shoot, some of the ball players still chew Red Man tobacco. </p> <p>It's also amurderously difficult gameto master, and thus one of the most beguiling. Curve balls and sliders wing from the pitcher's arm at 90mph towards a batsman armed only with a slim, round shaft of wood for defenc. Strike one. Bases loaded. Pinch-hitters and sluggers. RBIs and ABs. When they connect and clear the outfield for a home run, you cannot fail to be at once relieved and exhilarated. </p> <p>But ven if allthe stats and percentages leave you either bamboozled orcold, there is no nice way to while away a sunny southern Californian afternoon than at the top of Elysian Park Avenue. </p> <p> <strong> Celebrity spots: </strong> a day earlier, Carole King was singing the Star-Spangled Banner; Tom Cruise; Goldie Hawn and John Cusack. <br> <strong> Price of hot dog: </strong> $3.75. <br> <strong> Price of a beer: </strong> $5. <br> <strong> Price of a baseball hat:</strong> $12.99. <br> <strong> The regular baseball season: </strong> runs from April to October. <br> <strong> Regular ticket prices: </strong> $6-$38. <br> <strong> Where: </strong> Dodgers Stadium, 1000 Elysian Park Avenue, Echo Park. <br><strong> Box office tel: </strong> 001 (323) 2241448, <a href=\"http://www.dodgers.com\">www.dodgers.com</a> </p> <p><strong> The race </strong><br> Sunday 1pm: Long Beach Grand Prix</p> <p> An hour from downtown LA on the Metro Blue Line or, more fittingly, a 40-minute drive south down the coast, is what the publicity machine for the seaside resort ofLong Beach likes torefers to as \"the world's fastest beach party\". This three-day festival of sunshine, sound and speed, including the Toyota Grand Prix, is part of the 20-race CART FedEx Championship series. Fittingly, cenes from the movie Speed were filmed along Shoreline Drive where today's race is taking place. </p> <p>Monaco-style, 1.9 miles of Long Beach's palm-lined streets just up from the Pacific shoreare turned into a circuit, along which the racing cars chase for 82 laps. That's around 155 miles, pretty much going round in circlesat an average speed of 80-odd mph and topspeeds of more than 100mph. </p> <p>Californians love racing's playboy image and itsmovie-style setting - Hollywood legendPaul Newman is part-owner of the Newman-Haas racing team, which has two cars in the field, driven by Michael Andretti and Christian Fittipaldi. More than 200,000 turn out on a blisteringly hot day, many of them in nothing more than halterneck or bikini tops and cut-off jeans. Dedicated male fans sport multi-coloured Valvoline-labelled race shirts, smoke $7 Fittipaldi Premium cigars and eat from Fat Boy's Diner BBQ and King Taco stands. The group in the grandstand row in front of us appear to have eaten little and drunk a lot. They're having a roaring good time. </p> <p>Hollywood kicks in again before the race.

After the prayer for the drivers, there is a fly-over by US Navy F-18 jets and the Elite Frog Parachute Jump Team deliver the American Flag by \"airmail\".

      "bodyText": "'I've always called LA the world capital of sport,\" says Tommy Lasorda, senior vice-president of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who won two world baseball series when he was the team' manager from 1976 to 1998. That's world series, mind, even though only American and Canadian teams compete. The Hall of Famer and \"baseball's most popular ambassador\" may very wellhave a case for championing his city over the likes of London or New York for the world sporting crown, though. For when Angelenos are not worshipping at the outdoor altar of health and fitness - flinging their bronzed bodies about a beach volleyball court, say, in Santa Monica, or surfing the breaks at Zuma, rollerblading along Venice's Ocean Front Walk or maybe pumping up their pneumatic pecs at Muscle Beach - they like nothing better than to cheer on others in the pursuit of athletic excellence. The conditions are, of course, perfect for competitors and spectators alike: great weather, glorious west-coast setting and stadia that are out of this world. In the land of plenty, LA can be seen toenjoy an embarrassment of riches. The Dodgers outgrew their birthplace of Brooklyn and moved west for richer pickings in 1958. The LA Lakers relocated from Minnesota in 1960, have since won six basketball world championships, and in Magic Johnson had one of the greatest players in NBA history. The LA Kings have yet to lift ice hockey's Stanley Cup, but the team had Wayne Gretzky, known as The Great One, from the late 80s to early 90s. And, in a country where the car is still king, there's the Long Beach Grand Prix to keep the petrol heads happy. Each of these is a blockbuster franchise with Hollywood production values, budgets and box-office stars to match. Sports addicts who time it right can drift from one field of dreams to another over the space of a long weekend. In early April, the Lakers were putting the finishing touches to their West Conference-winning season before entering the play-offs for the NBA championships; the Dodgers were pitching their first home series of the millennium against the Cincinnati Reds; and Long Beach was waving the chequered flag on its 26th Grand Prix. Sadly, I couldn't stick around to catch the Kings' opening home play-off game against the Detroit Redwings. But ow there's an excuse to go back next April. The hoops Friday 7.30pm: LA Lakers versus Sacramento Kings The setting for tonight's hoop dreams is a $375 million, futuristic-lookingstadium in downtown LA, which opened last October. \"Uniquely LA\" is how Dan Meis, of architects NBBJ, describes his company's all-glass and metal creation. From the outside, it looks like a giant, glowing hockey puck at full til (it is also home to the KIngs as well as the Clippers, LA's other NBA franchise). Inside, the seating presses down on the varnished wooden court, making it appear way too small a stage for the world's tallest athletes. Even from a distance, you feel close to the action. But not as close as those who, like Jack Nicholson, pay $1,150 to be on top of it in thefloorside seats. \"Welcome to the Staples Center, the sports and entertainment centre of the world,\" says the public announcer. The world capital. The world champions. The world's biggest. Out of this world. There's reallyno place left to go from here, other than the centre of the universe. Americans are not ones for selling themselves short, but they sureknow how to put on a good show. Especially in Tinseltown. Before the action starts, there's the singing of the Star-Spangled Banner, the last time the 18,997-seater venue will stand still for the next two-and-a-half hours. The teams enter to strobe lights and disco music; the all-dancing Laker Girls distract the crowd between time-outs; vendors walk between the aisles handing out peanuts, burgers, hot dogs and even Pizza Hut boxes; the man sitting in the lucky seat number wins a year's subscription to Cigar Aficionado; \"When I say Lakers, you say go!\" On court, in the land of the giants, there is aa Goliath whodominates the game and the eye. \"A great physical specimen,\" is how film director Spike Lee describes Shaquille O'Neal in his basketball book, Best Seat in the House. At 7ft 1in and weighing 22 1/2 stone, the Lakers centre is a massive talent, dwarfing the other players who attempt to pirouette and fly past him. While the 6ft somethings circling the basket have tomake at least a token leap when they plop their shots through the hoop, Shaq's size 21 sneakers barely leave the ground as he twists and nonchalantly flicks the ball up and over the rim. Basketball is a fast and graceful game, even if Shaq appears to lumber unhurriedly between defence and attack. At the end,the Lakers run out winners by 121 points to 114 (Shaq has scored 41 of them). That's a lot of baskets for your average $40 seat price - and, in between, we've had an indoor fireworks display, break-dancing and a rapper singing \"We can get it on\". Celebrity spots: Pete Sampras and Garry Shandling. Price of a huge flame-grilled burger: $7.50. Price of a beer: $5. Price of a replica Shaq shirt, number 34: $150. Regular basketball season: runs from November to April. Regular ticket prices: $10-$150. Where: Staples Center, 1111 South Figueroa. Box office tel: (213) 742 7340710, www.staplescenter.com The ball game Saturday 5.15pm: LA Dodgers versus Cincinatti Reds Sports fans arriving at Dodgers Stadium must feel as though they have just died andarrived in heaven. Address: Elysian Park Avenue. Setting: on a hill overlooking downtown LA to the south, tree-lined Elysian hills to the north and east and the San Gabriel mountains beyond. Overhead: puffy white clouds in a cobalt-blue sky. There are even a couple of palm trees at the pavilion end, for Pete's sake. Or did I just dream that along with the chorus of angels? I didn't imagine that hallowed diamond, though. Pure manicured magic, all 100,000sq ft of the dazzling Bermuda grass and sand. If you build it, they will come.In the late 1950s, Brooklyn Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley had a dream to build a more modernball park for his Brooklyn Dodgers. New York couldn't come up with a site, so he moved them to LA. Simple economics. By 1962, the LA Dodgers had a 56,000-seater home, where they beat theCincinatti Reds 6-2 in their opening game on April 10. Thirty-eight years later almost to the day, the Dodgers are onceagain pitted against the Reds in their opening home series at Dodgers Stadiu. (They win the first game 8-1, but willlose this one 5-4). In the close season, the fifth oldes venue in baseballhas had a $50-million facelift, adding 35 luxury suites at $125,000 to $300,000 a season and nine rows of padded seats behind the home plate ($195-$250) to cater for the Hollywood set. More than half the seats in the stadium, though, are still available for $6. Since 1962, players' wages have gone through the roof,of course, and there have been ugly strikes and shut-outs down the year. But much about the game has reassuringly staye the same: the rules, the old-fashioned looking uniforms, the tradition of the seventh-inning stretch - when everybody stands up and sings \"Take me out to the ball game . . .\" - and the vendors holding up cotton candy and boxes of Crackerjack popcorn. Baseball is about as downhomey as it gets, a completecontrast to the rap-influenced, tattooed, blazinginner-city world of basketball. Shoot, some of the ball players still chew Red Man tobacco. It's also amurderously difficult gameto master, and thus one of the most beguiling. Curve balls and sliders wing from the pitcher's arm at 90mph towards a batsman armed only with a slim, round shaft of wood for defenc. Strike one. Bases loaded. Pinch-hitters and sluggers. RBIs and ABs. When they connect and clear the outfield for a home run, you cannot fail to be at once relieved and exhilarated. But ven if allthe stats and percentages leave you either bamboozled orcold, there is no nice way to while away a sunny southern Californian afternoon than at the top of Elysian Park Avenue. Celebrity spots: a day earlier, Carole King was singing the Star-Spangled Banner; Tom Cruise; Goldie Hawn and John Cusack. Price of hot dog: $3.75. Price of a beer: $5. Price of a baseball hat: $12.99. The regular baseball season: runs from April to October. Regular ticket prices: $6-$38. Where: Dodgers Stadium, 1000 Elysian Park Avenue, Echo Park. Box office tel: 001 (323) 2241448, www.dodgers.com The race Sunday 1pm: Long Beach Grand Prix An hour from downtown LA on the Metro Blue Line or, more fittingly, a 40-minute drive south down the coast, is what the publicity machine for the seaside resort ofLong Beach likes torefers to as \"the world's fastest beach party\". This three-day festival of sunshine, sound and speed, including the Toyota Grand Prix, is part of the 20-race CART FedEx Championship series. Fittingly, cenes from the movie Speed were filmed along Shoreline Drive where today's race is taking place. Monaco-style, 1.9 miles of Long Beach's palm-lined streets just up from the Pacific shoreare turned into a circuit, along which the racing cars chase for 82 laps. That's around 155 miles, pretty much going round in circlesat an average speed of 80-odd mph and topspeeds of more than 100mph. Californians love racing's playboy image and itsmovie-style setting - Hollywood legendPaul Newman is part-owner of the Newman-Haas racing team, which has two cars in the field, driven by Michael Andretti and Christian Fittipaldi. More than 200,000 turn out on a blisteringly hot day, many of them in nothing more than halterneck or bikini tops and cut-off jeans. Dedicated male fans sport multi-coloured Valvoline-labelled race shirts, smoke $7 Fittipaldi Premium cigars and eat from Fat Boy's Diner BBQ and King Taco stands. The group in the grandstand row in front of us appear to have eaten little and drunk a lot. They're having a roaring good time. Hollywood kicks in again before the race. Former allAmerican football star John Elway throws footballs into the crowd. After the prayer for the drivers, there is a fly-over by US Navy F-18 jets and the Elite Frog Parachute Jump Team deliver the American Flag by \"airmail\". There's a rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner, again, before those famous words: \"Gentleman, start your engines\".

Only nine of the original 25 drivers finish, and Christian Fittipaldi's car bursts into flames during a pit stop directlyopposite the grandstand. Canadian Paul \"Goin' to the wall\" Tracy takes the chequered flag, and we take the freeway back to LA . . . and get stuck in traffic. Celebrity spots: George Lucas.

A smooth move down the right from Zola produces a cross that is cleared as far as Wise on the right of the area. His first-time volley is well hit but straight at James.<br><strong>12</strong> First real test for de Goey as Wright hooks in a cross from the left. He comes and claims in confident fashion - it's going to take something special to get the better of him today.<br><strong>15</strong> Barry cuts off the rampant Melchiot in his prime, just as the Chelsea right wing back was accelerating onto a loose ball. The first <strong>booking</strong> of the match goes to the Villa man.<br><strong>18</strong> Melchiot returns the favour by barging Barry to the ground after a sloppy defensive header. The Chelsea defender is <strong>booked</strong>. The set piece is cleared by Babayaro for a corner.<br><strong>20</strong> Nothing comes from the centre, and Babayaro can take his time over clearing upfield. Merson needs more time on the ball to create things for Villa, as the Birmingham side look a little short of attacking ideas at the moment.<br><strong>24</strong> Villa are pressing forward as Chelsea are having trouble getting their collective foot on the ball. No Chelsea attack for five minutes now. Carbone has been notable in his absence thus far.<br><strong>26</strong> Leboeuf clears a Wright centre with a strong header out, but Merson, from fully 25 yards, drives a looping, curling effort just wide of the top corner. Referee Poll has spotted an earlier infringement by Wise on Boateng. The Chelsea skipper becomes the third name in the <strong>book</strong>.<br><strong>28</strong> James almost hands Chelsea a goal on a plate as he comes for a regular centre from the right, he jumps majestically and spills the catch pathetically. Luckily for Villa no Chelsea man foresaw the keeper's clumsiness and James was able to scramble and gather the ball, albeit with a sheepish look on his face.<br><strong>31</strong> Poyet hassles Ehiogu into conceding a corner from the left.<br><strong>32</strong> Gus Poyet is wearing Ian Taylor like a shirt. The cross is to the near post and James gathers well.<br><strong>35</strong> Not much to choose from the two teams thus far. A lot of effort and endeavour, but little quality. Looks like the match may be settled by the one goal. Again, another Chelsea attack breaks down in front of a resolute Villa defence.<br><strong>37</strong> Carbone loses the ball in the left midfield and goes bonkers at referee Poll for not giving the free kick. The challenge was very physical, but probably just this side of fair.<br><strong>39</strong> A free kick in a central position 35 yards out for Chelsea. Zola flicks the ball over a static Villa defense, aiming for Poyet, but Ian Taylor does enough to ensure that the Uruguayan makes no contact.<br><strong>40</strong> An error by Boateng almost lets in Weah. The Liberian is forced wide left, and then his cross is not what one would expect from a former World Player of the Year. Weah, like many players on both sides, is yet to rise to this occasion.<br><strong>42</strong> Wright, Carbone and Merson combine well on the left. Only a poor pass from Wright to Merson allows the move to break down and lets Chelsea regain possession. Merson looks furious with Wright.<br><strong>44</strong> A Zola free kick from the right causes some consternation in the Villa area. The unflappable Barry is able to deal with the joint threat of Weah and Desailly to head clear.<br><strong>45</strong> Leboeuf, timing his challenge on Dublin poorly, is paid back by Dion with a shove on the back of the head that leaves him, curiously, writhing on the floor clutching his buttocks. A quick wipe of the magic sponge later and the French defender is restored to health.<br><strong>46</strong> A quiet and dull first half comes to an end. The ref's whistle gets the loudest cheer of the day so far. No real chances, no real incident. Just like all the other recent Cup Finals then.<br> </p> <p><strong>45</strong> Right then - let's hope that Messrs. Vialli and Gregory have told their teams to shelve the tripe and start serving up football caviar for 300 million people watching this garbage worldwide. No changes on either side for the start of the second half.<br><strong>47</strong> Chelsea give up possession in their won half and are almost punished for it. Wright picks up the ball on the left and swings in a pacy cross that Taylor meets with a firm header. His effort flashes in front of de Goey and goes out of play. Goal kick. A sloppy start by the London side.<br><strong>49</strong> Merson's industry wins a corner on the left. The deep centre is met by Southgate at the far post. He connects well with the header but the effort sails over the Chelsea crossbar. Again, Chelsea's marking looked slack.<br><strong>50</strong> Zola on the centre right, flicks a ball through to Weah, who looks up and sees James stuck in no-man's land. His shot beats James but edges just wide of the Villa keeper's right-hand upright. Chelsea's best chance so far.<br><strong>52</strong> Poyet rants and raves at the referee long enough to earn a <strong>booking</strong>. The set piece, from the right, is overhit and de Goey collects with ease at the far post. This half is looking up though.<br><strong>55</strong> Di Matteo looks like he's running through custard with flippers on. How can a pro be so slow? From a through on the left, Poyet shoots at James, who spills the drive at the feet of Wise, who slots the ball home. Cue crazy celebrations - but no-one's noticed the linesman, who has his flag up. Eventually Wise stops cartwheeling around long enough to embark on a lengthy spell of swearing. After all that it's still nil-nil and James is the luckiest keeper on the planet.<br><strong>57</strong> Corner to Villa on the right. It's a case of too many legs spoil the clearance, as the ball gets stuck in the area. Eventually Leboeuf hoofs the ball upfield, but Boateng collects and just as he is about to unwind a netbuster, Wise slides in with a last-ditch blockage that takes man and ball at the same time.<br><strong>61</strong> All of Chelsea holds its collective hands on its collective head as Weah glides in to the far post to connect with a Poyet centre. All the cliches in the world don't do justice to a miss where it was harder to do what the Liberian did (slice the ball into Row Q) than to bury the ball in the goal. Maybe this just isn't Chelsea's day.<br><strong>64</strong> A clever flick from Zola releases Weah. James senses the danger early and is all over Weah like a fat kid on a burger. Chelsea are beginning to turn the screw, but are the Fates against them on this day of days?<br><strong>66</strong> Balding ex-England winger Steve Stone is warming up, so one of the Villa playmakers may have to make way. If Gregory substitutes Beni during the Cup Final he'll throw a wobbly that the guys on Mir could see.<br><strong>70</strong> A Villa free kick seeks out Southgate at the far post. He heads the ball back to Dublin, but the Villa striker cannot generate any power or direction into his header and de Goey can watch the ball sail out of play.<br><strong>72</strong> A nice Cruyff turn by Melchiot on the left foxes Delaney, who responds with a foul. <br><strong>73 GOAL! Aston Villa 0 - 1 Chelsea</strong> Zola's free kick is whipped into the area. James comes, gathers and spills at the feet of Roberto di Matteo, who simply swings his leg and starts celebrating.

Chelsea: de Goey, Melchiot, Desailly, Leboeuf, Babayaro, Poyet, Wise, Deschamps, Di Matteo, Zola, Weah. Substitutes: Flo, Morris, Cudicini, Terry, Harley. Referee: G Poll (Tring) No Flo for Chelsea as Weah gets the nod after his exertions on the train ground this week. Carbone and Merson will look to provide the creative vibe for a Villa side that may edge this final due to the intense pressure on their opponents. Will this be the dream final for Dublin, who broke his neck in December? 1 min A sunny Wembley hosts the season's showpiece finale - these two teams should provide a good spectacle. 3 Early exchanges in midfield results in Villa possession as Carbone's guile overcomes Wise's industry. 7 Chelsea are getting hold of the ball more as Deschamps starts to win more tackles in midfield. A smooth move down the right from Zola produces a cross that is cleared as far as Wise on the right of the area. His first-time volley is well hit but straight at James. 12 First real test for de Goey as Wright hooks in a cross from the left. He comes and claims in confident fashion - it's going to take something special to get the better of him today. 15 Barry cuts off the rampant Melchiot in his prime, just as the Chelsea right wing back was accelerating onto a loose ball. The first booking of the match goes to the Villa man. 18 Melchiot returns the favour by barging Barry to the ground after a sloppy defensive header. The Chelsea defender is booked. The set piece is cleared by Babayaro for a corner. 20 Nothing comes from the centre, and Babayaro can take his time over clearing upfield. Merson needs more time on the ball to create things for Villa, as the Birmingham side look a little short of attacking ideas at the moment. 24 Villa are pressing forward as Chelsea are having trouble getting their collective foot on the ball.

But remember - when time is tight, an issue is of low priority or requires a specialist's decision - working as a team may not always be the answer. Mostly 'd's: Mr Livingstone, I presume? Like the new mayor of London, you're happy to use a team when it suits you but you'll go out on a limb if things don't go your way. Face it, you're far too egotistical to ever be a good team player. You do, however, have a lot to offer: you're conscientious, have a sharp, creative mind and unconventional ideas. Do yourself - and your company - a favour... become self-employed. \u0095 With thanks to Philip Wilson, senior occupational psychologist at the London Fire Service.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Dear Alex,</strong><br> The Sierra Leone fiasco reinforces a lesson the UN should have learned years ago but is still shamefully reluctant to accept: if there isn't a peace, you can't keep it - and the attempt to keep non-existent peaces is not merely a waste of time, but carries a huge risk of exacerbating the very conflicts the peacekeepers were meant to help resolve. </p> <p>There is a place for UN monitoring, where the parties to a conflict have reached a genuine settlement, backed by their dispositions on the ground, which the intervening force can help guarantee. Sierra Leone had no more than a bogus settlement, reminiscent of Angola in 1991-92, or worse, Rwanda in 1993-94: paper agreements between bitterly hostile adversaries. UN peacekeepers were sent in, though neither side had disarmed, and one side had accepted the agreement mostly to gain a breathing space in which to strengthen its position. </p> <p>Providing such a space only makes things worse. In Rwanda, the Arusha accords gave hardliners in the government the opportunity to organise genocide. Sierra Leone is similar: the Lom\u00e9 agreement of May 1999, into which the Kabbah government was pressured by the UN and others, ostensibly established a coalition between an ineffectual elected government and a ruthless armed opposition with a record of reneging on agreements. The peacekeepers sent in to police it were so poorly armed that hundreds could be rounded up as soon as the war resumed. </p> <p>It is open to the UN to send real fighting forces into situations like Sierra Leone, to kill and be killed, if the states concerned allow it. That would be a very hazardous enterprise, and unlikely to lead to the reconstruction of Sierra Leone. But at least the UN would have some idea of what it was supposed to be doing. Peacekeeping as seen in recent conflicts is a farce fuelled by wishful thinking. We'd be better off without it. <br> Yours sincerely, <br> Christopher Clapham, </p> <p>Professor of politics and international relations,<br> Lancaster University </p> <p><strong> Dear Christopher,</strong><br> I acknowledge your reservations about fragile peace agreements: the Lom\u00e9 agreement was seriously flawed. But the UK and US were primary influences in initiating Lom\u00e9; the UN was fully aware of its weaknesses. Traditional peace-keeping is often inapplicable to internal wars, but the UN has been trying to develop appropriate responses to such emergencies. It is the unwillingness of the more powerful UN member states, not least the five permanent members of the Security Council, to provide sufficient resources for an operation's effectiveness that is the problem. </p> <p>Perhaps a lesson can be learned from East Timor last year, where the May agreement providing for a referendum to decide the province's future status was deeply flawed: the Indonesian authorities insisted upon guaranteeing security. It was inadequate UN involvement that allowed gross human rights abuses against the East Timorese people before, and especially after, the vote. Only then was the international community convinced to provide a proper input. No one can pretend that the referendum process was an unqualified success, nor that UN involvement has been smooth. But there at least appears to have been progress, which could not have occurred without the UN. </p> <p>Peace processes are delicate, dynamic and risky. It is difficult to persuade the international community to prepare effective contingencies until it is too late. Meanwhile, people continue to live (or die) in misery while the international community prevaricates. The responsibility lies with UN member states, particularly those in the Security Council, to provide operations with sufficient resources to reduce the risks, including strengthening peace agreements in the first place. <br> Yours sincerely, <br> Alex Ramsbotham,<br> Head, UN and conflict unit, <br> United Nations Association-UK </p> <p><strong> Dear Alex,</strong><br> I do not agree the failings of the UN can be separated from those of its member states, least of all the permanent members of the Security Council. The UN is an assembly of states; its strengths and weaknesses are reflected in those of its leading members. Their reluctance to provide resources for peacekeeping, most of all to risk troops, is a reality derived from bitter experience, notably that of the US in Somalia. </p> <p>I do not believe that many conflicts can be resolved through external intervention. East Timor, like Namibia a decade earlier, was a crisis to which a clear, acceptable solution could be found, through the simple mechanism of independence validated by an internationally supervised election. Crises like those in Somalia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone or Congo are not like that. These are fundamentally internal wars which can only be resolved internally: either by one combatant securing supremacy, or through a compromise in which each party recognises a settlement. </p> <p>Bodged settlements only delay, and often prevent, this resolution. Either the force brought in to monitor them packs up at the first sign of trouble, or it gets dragged into a long-term commitment in which its own role is compromised, and its costs escalate - not least in lives. The UN must acknowledge its limitations, and avoid getting dragged into conflicts it cannot resolve and in which its involvement can only damage its credibility and the welfare of those it is trying to help. <br> Yours sincerely, <br> Christopher </p> <p><strong> Dear Christopher,</strong><br> I cannot agree that external intervention is inappropriate to internal wars; nor are they ever really internal for very long. It cannot be assumed that a lack of intervention will accelerate resolution. In Sudan, a highly destructive war has been continuing despite international involvement being limited to diplomacy, non-military humanitarian aid and development assistance; Somalia, since the UN's withdrawal, is no nearer stability. Military victory does not guarantee peace: in Afghanistan, the Taliban is not renowned for respecting human rights. </p> <p>This does not assume that forcible military intervention is desirable: it is costly in human and financial terms and ineffective. Some of the UN's best (but least public) achievements have been through preventive action, such as the pre-emptive deployment in Macedonia. I accept that bodged peace agreements are unsatisfactory and urge the international community to increase preventive efforts, especially through the UN. But where military intervention is necessary to protect life and promote stability, it must be undertaken, even if it requires a long-term commitment by the international community. <br> Yours sincerely, <br> Alex </p> <p><strong> Dear Alex,</strong><br> I feel we are on similar ground: we both recognise and support the obligation of the international community, acting through the UN, to do what it can to resolve conflicts in which internal and external elements are often impossible to distinguish. There is a role for peacekeeping forces and preventive action. </p> <p>But we differ over something more important. You believe that the world is ultimately controllable: that the UN, backed by the leading members of the Security Council, can, with sufficient goodwill and determination, police an international system in which viable states are maintained, governments are stabilised, and basic respect for human rights is assured. Sadly, I cannot agree, and the cases that you cite - including Afghanistan and Somalia - make it clear why not. </p> <p>The long-term commitment by the international community would involve the imposition of a new colonialism enforced by the armies of industrial states. It would also be impossible: no amount of commitment (which in practice translates into \"no number of dead soldiers\") is going to protect life and promote stability. It can only promote further instability, as it did when the Russians intervened in Afghanistan and the Americans in Somalia. </p> <p>No matter how tragic the loss of life, and how appalling the abuse of rights, the UN and its leading states must recognise the limitations on their capacities, and come to terms as best they can with a world that they cannot control. They must resist the temptation to send peacekeepers into situations where they add to the number of victims of the UN's naivety and overambition. <br> Sincerely, Christopher </p> <p><strong> Dear Christopher,</strong><br> <br> I'm pleased we agree on the need for increasing the focus on preventive action. But the fact that conflict prevention is at present so inadequate suggests there are situations where more emergency measures are required. I think we can distinguish between the neo-imperialist imposition of western ideals and the obligations of richer, more stable countries to uphold their responsibilities to poorer or less stable states, whose predicament we have often had a significant role in creating. One would hope local people would lead the way in designing models for governance. </p> <p>I agree that attempts by the UN, or anyone else, to intervene in evidently unsuitable circumstances are likely to be counterproductive. The UN has been very cautious in its approach to the Congo, although much greater (not necessarily military) international assistance might help to ameliorate the situation. In Sierra Leone, much more could have been done much earlier to address the grotesque behaviour of the RUF and improve the circumstances surrounding Lom\u00e9. But while acknowledging the input of UN peacekeepers, the improved circumstances since the arrival of highly efficient, well-resourced British troops demonstrates the effect such support can have. </p> <p>It's precisely the uncontrollable nature of the world that warrants some forum for global management, not only in security terms. The UN was established in the wake of two world wars to counter the massive destruction that accompanied such inter-state conflicts. The changing nature of war can be seen as a consequence of some success in the UN's original raison d' tre. The problems that it is experiencing with internal conflict is a reason to make stronger efforts rather than to disengage. <br> Sincerely, Alex</p>",

It's precisely the uncontrollable nature of the world that warrants some forum for global management, not only in security terms. The UN was established in the wake of two world wars to counter the massive destruction that accompanied such inter-state conflicts. The changing nature of war can be seen as a consequence of some success in the UN's original raison d' tre. The problems that it is experiencing with internal conflict is a reason to make stronger efforts rather than to disengage. Sincerely, Alex",

      "body": "<p>Every now and then, you come across a classic restaurant - somewhere that does what it does supremely well, that goes about its business with unobtrusive authority. Ristorante Abruzzi in the via del Vaccaro in Rome is one of these rare treasures.</p> <p>Eating out in Rome has changed a bit in recent years. The old-fashioned pizzerias are giving way to fast-food joints, old-fashioned trattorie are being replaced by snazzy, new-style ones, traditional dishes are being subjected to a Ground Force-style makeover into la cucina nuova . Perhaps that's inevitable. Even in the Eternal City things must change a little. Trouble is, if you do away with the old completely, you lose sight of where you came from. And you might lose Ristorante Abruzzi, which, in spite of its name, is an old-fashioned trattoria.</p> <p>The list of its virtues begins with its position, just off the Corso, not far from Piazza Venezia, and a minute's walk from one of the most exquisite squares in Rome, the perfectly symmetrical Piazza S. Iganazio. Its entrance is unobtrusive and unremarkable. The inside is unobtrusive and unremarkable, too - two rooms with crazy-paving marble floors, white walls dotted with large prints of Roman views, and comfortable, sturdy chairs and tables. The service is brisk but polite. Energy is not wasted on irrelevancies. It has the elegance of purpose.</p> <p>Wine? We will bring you wine. The house wines, just red and white, are admirable. They are wines made to go with food, not too heavy, not too light, wines of distinct character, but not in-your-face, up-your-nose, grab-you-by-the-tonsils wine. They are sensible wines. You can get more expensive wines, maybe better wines, but why bother? The menu, however, is long: antipasti, paste asciutte, zuppe, piatti pronti per giorno (main courses), piatti da fassi espressi (quick dishes), cacciagone (game), pesce (fish), verdure (vegetables), not to mention cheese, puddings and fruit. That's 70 dishes, all told, and all of them traditional - far too many for a restaurant to produce to any reasonable consistency under normal circumstances. But Ristorante Abruzzi is supra-normal, and I don't suppose that the menu has changed much in 40 years. That's enough time to get things properly sorted.</p> <p>Take my six-year-old nephew James's main course, tortellini in brodo. It's a classic Italian dish and, as is so often the way with classics, much abused in the hands of lesser chefs, who take short cuts or who feel obliged to add the imprint of their own creativity. The perfection of tortellini in brodo lies in its simplicity - good chicken broth, fine pasta stuffed with good meat, cooked to where it just holds its own against the pressure of the teeth. Just like James's helping, in fact. No wonder he scoffed it down. Another nephew, Lawrence, had fettuccine ai funghi porcini. You could argue that the porcini were well out of season, so perhaps they were sott'olio (kept in oil), or perhaps they were flown in from South Africa. No matter - they were plentiful, and the pasta firm against their soft slipperiness.</p> <p>The grown-ups, meanwhile, opted for antipasti from the cold, help-yourself counter. I helped myself to: a triangle of fritatta, a braised artichoke, onion roasted with a slice of tomato on top, a slice of grilled aubergine, a dollop of aubergines in oil, ditto peppers, marinated fresh anchovies, courgettes baked with tomato pur\u00e9e, courgettes baked with Parmesan, fried courgettes, a heap of spinach and a few olives. I think that was it, but I did not exhaust what was on offer. The anchovies aside, it was a masterpiece of vegetarian cooking, except, of course, I never thought of it as such: it was just fabulous cooking.</p> <p>We moved on to straccetti di manzo con rughetta, a quick-fry of shards of beef and rocket, sauced with the meat juices and oil in which it was cooked and a dash of lemon. A fantastically simple dish that is fantastically good, as long as your beef and rocket taste as clearly as they did here. My main course was even simpler, bracciolette di abbacchio scottadito, or roasted lamb chops. That's all it was. Two lamb chops on a plate. No sauce. No veg. No garnish. No gravy. It was what you might call pure food. The chops were pure in flavour, too - a crisp pale amber to the eye, firm to the tooth, plaything to the tastebud. My brother and his wife spoke in similar cheerful tones of their bistecca di manzo alla griglia. Vegetables were served separately - artichokes for them, cold spinach dressed with oil and lemon for me.</p> <p>It would be unreasonable to expect puddings to maintain this exalted level, and they didn't. But, ice cream and zabaglione apart, they do not play as major a part in the culinary passions of Italy as they do here.

      "byline": "Kurt Jacobsen",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On a muggy spring day the tower bells of the stately Rockefeller Chapel chime \"New York, New York\" in mischievous homage to the renowned arch-neurotic Woody Allen. No one ever had a bigger crush on the Big Apple. (\"I have a weak spot for New York City and I fantasised about it as I grew up,\" Allen confesses. \"A New York of penthouses and white telephones that never really existed anywhere except on film.\") But this is the cerebral stronghold of the University of Chicago, where a long queue for a free sneak preview of Woody Allen's annual flick - his 33rd in 34 years - spills outside an ornate Gothic hall. </p> <p>Small Time Crooks, co-starring Tracey Ullman as low-life thief Allen's entrepreneurial wife and Elaine May as their ditzy accomplice, is a sure thing, laced with wonderfully funny lines and saturnine plot twists. It's the kind of film that those vulture-like fans in Stardust Memories demanded that the harried artist churn out: Hey, don't make pretentious dramas (Interiors) that don't work, make pretentious comedies that do. </p> <p>Despite the heat Allen wears light brown corduroys, a green pullover, brown shoes and those black-rimmed glasses without which he says he feels existentially naked (\"like Groucho Marx minus the moustache\"). Although he complains about a hearing loss, you want to tell him that hypochondria and neuroses as comic stigmata must agree with him because he looks great and you can't believe he is 64. Allen speaks genially and lengthily about scriptwriting, the decline of comedy, the blight of \"factory-made\" films and theatre, and his deceptively varied body of film work (\"I'm always seen as doing the same thing. It's like Chinese food - many different dishes but it's all Chinese food.\") </p> <p>Once again, in Small Time Crooks, Allen plays a dim-witted hustler surrounded by a motley crew of low-IQ louts and lasses. Why the attraction? \"There are two things that I can play, apart from a sperm and an ant. I can play an intellectual. I get credit for appearing to be an intellectual because I wear big dark glasses. But I'm closer to the dimwit in Small Time Crooks. You should see me at home. I'm not hunched over a copy of Heiddeger making marginal notes. I'm sitting with a beer in my hand watching the Knicks. I can play dim-witted characters because that's who I grew up around. I can play Broadway Danny Rose, and the character in Take the Money and Run and I can play this character. I have an affinity for them.\" </p> <p>So why does Allen seem so sadly condemned to comedy? \"I wish that I had been born with the talent to be serious. My favourite artists are Chekhov, Tennessee Williams, Ibsen, Eugene O'Neill, Arthur Miller. Ingmar Bergman in film. These are the people I idolised. I just don't have what it takes to be that kind of artist. So I struggle and I try to make that work every now and then. But I sweat and huff and puff and maybe sometimes it's OK and sometimes maybe it embarrasses me. Whereas when I'm working in comedy it comes very gracefully for me. It's just an accidental fate that I was born with that kind of gift. </p> <p>\"People at the box office line up for what I call the neanderthal style. In Small Time Crooks I liked the notion that people want to rob a bank and that their cookie business - that they use to rob the bank - takes off and makes them rich. That element of wit is what attracted me to it. But many contemporary comedies come out with relentless toilet jokes because there's a big market for it.\" </p> <p>So are audiences today dumber than they used to be? \"I never believed in the dumbing down of the country. It can't be that - because every generation has got to feel that their generation was the cultivated and sensitive one, and the new generation is Philistine. Culture has gotten more informal and more relaxed. The time I saw A Streetcar Named Desire it was clear that Blanche was the heroine and Stanley was the nefarious, sinister, unruly brute. But after you look at it over the years you start to feel that, you know, she's crazy. She comes into his house and she's stiff and she's formal - and the world has gotten more informal and so now we understand Stanley's position more.</p> <p> Now you have a more American sensibility that's expressed in a general loosening up of the culture and it is reflected in films. In comedy, though, the films got more - I don't know - infantile. The big test for me is : Does the film go any place? All the writers I know have a million good ideas that don't go places. When I wrote Purple Rose of Cairo, the guy coming off the screen was a funny idea but it didn't go anywhere. I got 50 pages out and the thing drops dead. I put it in the drawer. But six months later it occurs to me that if the actor in Hollywood comes into this small town and then the guy comes off the screen and falls in love with a girl who has to choose between fantasy and reality - and she chooses reality and it hurts her - well, I knew I had something. </p> <p>\"Same thing with Bullets Over Broadway. The idea of the gangster as a playwright who really did have talent was a funny idea. But it dropped dead halfway through. Only when the idea occurs to me that the gangster realises that the actress is screwing up his dialogue and he kills her, did I realise I had someplace to go with the movie. With Small Time Crooks. The fact that they rent this cookie store next to the bank and the cookie store hits it big - that's a nice idea. Only when I had the idea that money changes them and they start putting on airs and becoming pretentious did I really have something. </p> <p>\"Comic ideas are cheap but ideas that flower, that develop into something are not so easy to find. It's laborious to plot out things; when you get that idea you tend to rush ahead too rapidly and you force the ending. There is no shortage of film companies that will see a funny idea and they won't care that it doesn't go any place.

      "bodyText": "On a muggy spring day the tower bells of the stately Rockefeller Chapel chime \"New York, New York\" in mischievous homage to the renowned arch-neurotic Woody Allen. No one ever had a bigger crush on the Big Apple. (\"I have a weak spot for New York City and I fantasised about it as I grew up,\" Allen confesses. \"A New York of penthouses and white telephones that never really existed anywhere except on film.\") But this is the cerebral stronghold of the University of Chicago, where a long queue for a free sneak preview of Woody Allen's annual flick - his 33rd in 34 years - spills outside an ornate Gothic hall. Small Time Crooks, co-starring Tracey Ullman as low-life thief Allen's entrepreneurial wife and Elaine May as their ditzy accomplice, is a sure thing, laced with wonderfully funny lines and saturnine plot twists. It's the kind of film that those vulture-like fans in Stardust Memories demanded that the harried artist churn out: Hey, don't make pretentious dramas (Interiors) that don't work, make pretentious comedies that do. Despite the heat Allen wears light brown corduroys, a green pullover, brown shoes and those black-rimmed glasses without which he says he feels existentially naked (\"like Groucho Marx minus the moustache\"). Although he complains about a hearing loss, you want to tell him that hypochondria and neuroses as comic stigmata must agree with him because he looks great and you can't believe he is 64. Allen speaks genially and lengthily about scriptwriting, the decline of comedy, the blight of \"factory-made\" films and theatre, and his deceptively varied body of film work (\"I'm always seen as doing the same thing. It's like Chinese food - many different dishes but it's all Chinese food.\") Once again, in Small Time Crooks, Allen plays a dim-witted hustler surrounded by a motley crew of low-IQ louts and lasses. Why the attraction? \"There are two things that I can play, apart from a sperm and an ant. I can play an intellectual. I get credit for appearing to be an intellectual because I wear big dark glasses. But I'm closer to the dimwit in Small Time Crooks. You should see me at home. I'm not hunched over a copy of Heiddeger making marginal notes. I'm sitting with a beer in my hand watching the Knicks. I can play dim-witted characters because that's who I grew up around. I can play Broadway Danny Rose, and the character in Take the Money and Run and I can play this character. I have an affinity for them.\" So why does Allen seem so sadly condemned to comedy? \"I wish that I had been born with the talent to be serious. My favourite artists are Chekhov, Tennessee Williams, Ibsen, Eugene O'Neill, Arthur Miller. Ingmar Bergman in film. These are the people I idolised. I just don't have what it takes to be that kind of artist. So I struggle and I try to make that work every now and then. But I sweat and huff and puff and maybe sometimes it's OK and sometimes maybe it embarrasses me. Whereas when I'm working in comedy it comes very gracefully for me. It's just an accidental fate that I was born with that kind of gift. \"People at the box office line up for what I call the neanderthal style. In Small Time Crooks I liked the notion that people want to rob a bank and that their cookie business - that they use to rob the bank - takes off and makes them rich. That element of wit is what attracted me to it. But many contemporary comedies come out with relentless toilet jokes because there's a big market for it.\" So are audiences today dumber than they used to be? \"I never believed in the dumbing down of the country. It can't be that - because every generation has got to feel that their generation was the cultivated and sensitive one, and the new generation is Philistine. Culture has gotten more informal and more relaxed. The time I saw A Streetcar Named Desire it was clear that Blanche was the heroine and Stanley was the nefarious, sinister, unruly brute. But after you look at it over the years you start to feel that, you know, she's crazy. She comes into his house and she's stiff and she's formal - and the world has gotten more informal and so now we understand Stanley's position more. Now you have a more American sensibility that's expressed in a general loosening up of the culture and it is reflected in films. In comedy, though, the films got more - I don't know - infantile. The big test for me is : Does the film go any place? All the writers I know have a million good ideas that don't go places. When I wrote Purple Rose of Cairo, the guy coming off the screen was a funny idea but it didn't go anywhere. I got 50 pages out and the thing drops dead. I put it in the drawer. But six months later it occurs to me that if the actor in Hollywood comes into this small town and then the guy comes off the screen and falls in love with a girl who has to choose between fantasy and reality - and she chooses reality and it hurts her - well, I knew I had something. \"Same thing with Bullets Over Broadway. The idea of the gangster as a playwright who really did have talent was a funny idea. But it dropped dead halfway through. Only when the idea occurs to me that the gangster realises that the actress is screwing up his dialogue and he kills her, did I realise I had someplace to go with the movie. With Small Time Crooks. The fact that they rent this cookie store next to the bank and the cookie store hits it big - that's a nice idea. Only when I had the idea that money changes them and they start putting on airs and becoming pretentious did I really have something. \"Comic ideas are cheap but ideas that flower, that develop into something are not so easy to find. It's laborious to plot out things; when you get that idea you tend to rush ahead too rapidly and you force the ending. There is no shortage of film companies that will see a funny idea and they won't care that it doesn't go any place. They'll give it to a movie star who will do it because they see themselves getting a lot of laughs but never realising it isn't going any place and then they find it is a disaster.\" Why did he not try his hand more at theatre than films? \"I wanted to be a playwright originally. When I was a young man the theatre was much more significant than film. What happened was the influx of these great foreign films started to wake American film-makers up. Suddenly American movies improved and grew up a little bit. Coupled with that the American theatre got more and more into these factory-made spectacles and got away from the great things it had. I wish the theatre was thriving as I knew it in New York when I grew up.\" The experience of helplessly watching his first script, What's New Pussycat?, undergo a severe mangling was traumatic and inspiring: \"I stood there with no clout whatever because it was my first job.

The birth was straightforward and Cherie and I were very, very grateful.\" The prime minister said Mrs Blair was very tired after a long labour but \"very happy... Cherie and the baby are absolutely fine. He's a gorgeous little boy.\" The birth was a natural one, rather than the Caesarean section that many had expected. \"[Cherie Blair] and the prime minister are looking forward to a quiet weekend spending time with their new son and their other children, who are delighted,\" said a Downing Street spokesman. The baby is the first to be born to a serving British prime minister in 150 years, and a fourth child for the couple. Mr Blair spoke to his father this morning to tell him of the baby's arrival. Mrs Blair's father, the actor Tony Booth, declared himself \"absolutely thrilled and delighted\" at the news that he had another grandson. \"I know both his parents and brothers and sister are completely besotted with him.\" Flowers and congratulations began arriving at Downing Street this morning, including bouquets from the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and Tory leader William Hague, as well as family, friends, and well-wishers. Mr Hague said: \"Ffion and I were delighted to hear of the birth of Tony and Cherie's baby son and we send our congratulations to them and their children. \"This is a wonderful day for them and a happy day for the country as a whole. We send them all our best wishes for the future.\"",

Two military battalions were also deployed around the country to help police curb the violence. But there was no indication that soldiers were intervening to end the hostage drama. Mr Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister, angered the Pacific island state by packing his administration with Indo-Fijians. Last night there were reports that Fiji's Indian community, who make up 44% of the 800,000 population of the islands, were already trying to flee overseas as thousands had done after two coups in 1987 reinforced Fijian control of parliament. The arrival of seven masked armed men in parliament ends weeks of speculation that Mr Chaudhry, whose rainbow coalition won power in a landslide exactly a year ago, would be deposed. A joint statement of Fijian political parties issued just before the coup said that civil unrest would continue until the government and the 1997 multi racial constitution under which it had been elected were removed. \"No right-thinking Fijian will allow this government, which has been manifestly anti-Fijian in both direction and intent, to continue to violate the desires and aspirations of the indigenous Fijian people,\" it said.

To the delight of mobs who looted and burned Indian-owned shops in the capital, Suva, ethnic Fijian nationalist George Speight yesterday declared himself interim president, suspending the constitution and appointing an opposition MP and political novice, Ratu Timoci Silatolu, as interim prime minister. This morning Mr Speight announced that he had sacked the president and would swear in a new government. In a radio interview he said his 'legal administration' would be in place by the end of the day and that the president Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara was no longer relevant. The coup leader has been negotiating with the military through the 1987 coup leader and former prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, and said the police and army were remaining neutral while the civil administration was in limbo. The markets and shops of Suva would be closed today as the country remains in a state of emergency. Mr Speight was described yesterday as a computer salesman with a taste for the flamboyant gestures but with hitherto little public support. However, it was unclear whether the ethnic Fijian-dominated armed forces would back Mr Speight. Both the coup leader and the president claimed yesterday that they had the loyalty of the military. Mr Speight said:'I am asserting control, I am asserting executive power over Fiji as I speak. All executive power currently resides in my hands.' He also claimed that the armed forces were at his 'beck and call'. Sir Kamisese, whose daughter, Adi Koila Mara, was among the ministers being held hostage, declared a state of emergency yesterday. He gave himself the power to command the military, and appealed to the hostage-takers to release the MPs. He also urged the army and police to restore the rule of law. 'I regret to say what is happening today is not in accordance with the constitution and is therefore unlawful,' Sir Kamisese said. The bloodless coup was instantly condemned by Commonwealth leaders, who warned that the south Pacific nation could face suspension. The Commonwealth's secretary general, Don McKinnon, said he was 'sad and angry' over the attack on Fiji 's elected government. 'I have been in touch with the president of Fiji to offer my full support for his efforts to restore constitutional rule,' he said. Australia's prime minister, John Howard said: 'I'm horrified that such an act should be carried out against a democratically elected leader.' The storming of parliament came as about 5,000 people demonstrated against Mr Chaudhry on the anniversary of his election. Police imposed a curfew as a pall of smoke hung over Suva's many burnt stores and 300 troops fanned out across the city. Two military battalions were also deployed around the country to help police curb the violence. But there was no indication that soldiers were intervening to end the hostage drama. Mr Chaudhry, Fiji 's first ethnic Indian prime minister, angered the Pacific island state by packing his administration with Indo-Fijians. Last night there were reports that Fiji 's Indian community, who make up 44% of the 800,000 population of the islands, were already trying to flee overseas as thousands had done after two coups in 1987 reinforced Fijian control of parliament. The arrival of seven masked armed men in parliament ends weeks of speculation that Mr Chaudhry, whose rainbow coalition won power in a landslide exactly a year ago, would be deposed.

      "body": "<p>It may be that landing a great account just doesn't provide the same rush any more. Or that your eyes glaze over when reading those once-riveting sales projections. Or that you're aimlessly web surfing when you should be multi-tasking. </p> <p>Professionally speaking, the thrill may not be entirely gone. But it certainly isn't what it used to be. What happened to that driving sense of focus? </p> <p>Some reach this point and immediately press the panic button: Did I chose the wrong career? Should I start over again? Have I been living a lie? </p> <p>But, in most cases, that's an unnecessarily extreme reaction. It's quite normal to realise that, on many days, a career is a job rather than a heart-pounding adventure. </p> <p>The key? Keeping distractions to a minimum and maintaining focus on the work-related tasks at hand. Here's how: </p> <p><strong> 1. Invent a challenge.</strong> </p> <p>A lack of focus often emerges because what once was exciting - landing a top client, nailing down a tricky quarterly forecast, etc. - has now become old hat. </p> <p>This isn't a bad thing, really. It just means you've become good at what you do. You've adapted highly efficient ways to get it done quickly. Still, that means you have some extra time on your hands. </p> <p>Career coach Laura Berman Fortgang, author of Take Yourself to the Top (Thorsons), suggests finding your own source of spark. </p> <p>\"Sleuth out a flaw in the company that is costing the company money and create a proposal for how you can fix it. That will re-energise you and re-engage you in the game,\" she suggests. </p> <p>\"Go to your boss and ask them to challenge you more or give you a big project to handle,\" she adds. \"Find a 'secret mission' within your job. Redesign the job for ultimate satisfaction. </p> <p>\"Think of what skills and talents you'd like to be using and what part of the business you would like to impact.\" </p> <p><strong> 2. Face reality - quality work isn't easy.</strong> </p> <p>Yes, solutions to complex work tasks require careful research and analysis. Still, too many employees seek the easy way out. When they meet a roadblock, their interest wanes. </p> <p>One solution is to break off an intimidating project into incremental portions of accomplishment. Let success be defined by mini-victories that build upon each other. </p> <p>Have a list of them and tick them off when you've achieved each one and give yourself a moment to celebrate. </p> <p>Maybe go for pizza and a pint with some friends (after working hours, of course) but quickly move forward to the next challenge. </p> <p><strong> 3. Tech tools should help, not hinder, productivity.</strong> </p> <p>There's your work email account. Then a personal email account that you call up on the web. Then mobile phones. Not to mention pagers... </p> <p>When do we get a chance to disconnect and zero in on the job at hand? Evaluate which tech tools are really essential and cut back on what isn't. Do you really need to check that personal email five times a day? Try doing it once in the morning and once at the end of the day. </p> <p>Can you survive by logging off the work email and (shudder!) turning off your pager for an hour to focus on a deadline? Good. Do it. And you don't have to grab those voice mail messages every time that annoying blinking light goes on. Cover up the light with a piece of paper for an hour or two. (Out of sight, out of mind.) Then, clean up the voice mail once you've gotten a good chunk of today's 'to do' list taken care of. </p> <p>If you're finding yourself too readily distracted by non-work related web wandering, it may not require an all-out moratorium. But try setting a limit. Say, a half hour during the lunch break. </p> <p>Often times, non-work related web surfing and other distractions are pursued when workers are anxious about a task at hand and seek avoidance. </p> <p><strong> 4. It could very well be the job, not you.</strong> </p> <p>It's not uncommon, especially in today's 'here today, gone tomorrow' workforce mentality. Job jumping doesn't have the same negative stigma these days that it did in generations past. </p> <p>The trick is to leave before you're getting pushed out. It's much easier to find a job when you're not hitting a desperation period. </p> <p>Assess and act before the real trouble signs set in.

      "bodyText": "It may be that landing a great account just doesn't provide the same rush any more. Or that your eyes glaze over when reading those once-riveting sales projections. Or that you're aimlessly web surfing when you should be multi-tasking. Professionally speaking, the thrill may not be entirely gone. But it certainly isn't what it used to be. What happened to that driving sense of focus? Some reach this point and immediately press the panic button: Did I chose the wrong career? Should I start over again? Have I been living a lie? But, in most cases, that's an unnecessarily extreme reaction. It's quite normal to realise that, on many days, a career is a job rather than a heart-pounding adventure. The key? Keeping distractions to a minimum and maintaining focus on the work-related tasks at hand. Here's how: 1. Invent a challenge. A lack of focus often emerges because what once was exciting - landing a top client, nailing down a tricky quarterly forecast, etc. - has now become old hat. This isn't a bad thing, really. It just means you've become good at what you do. You've adapted highly efficient ways to get it done quickly. Still, that means you have some extra time on your hands. Career coach Laura Berman Fortgang, author of Take Yourself to the Top (Thorsons), suggests finding your own source of spark. \"Sleuth out a flaw in the company that is costing the company money and create a proposal for how you can fix it. That will re-energise you and re-engage you in the game,\" she suggests. \"Go to your boss and ask them to challenge you more or give you a big project to handle,\" she adds. \"Find a 'secret mission' within your job. Redesign the job for ultimate satisfaction. \"Think of what skills and talents you'd like to be using and what part of the business you would like to impact.\" 2. Face reality - quality work isn't easy. Yes, solutions to complex work tasks require careful research and analysis. Still, too many employees seek the easy way out. When they meet a roadblock, their interest wanes. One solution is to break off an intimidating project into incremental portions of accomplishment. Let success be defined by mini-victories that build upon each other. Have a list of them and tick them off when you've achieved each one and give yourself a moment to celebrate. Maybe go for pizza and a pint with some friends (after working hours, of course) but quickly move forward to the next challenge. 3. Tech tools should help, not hinder, productivity. There's your work email account. Then a personal email account that you call up on the web. Then mobile phones. Not to mention pagers... When do we get a chance to disconnect and zero in on the job at hand? Evaluate which tech tools are really essential and cut back on what isn't. Do you really need to check that personal email five times a day? Try doing it once in the morning and once at the end of the day. Can you survive by logging off the work email and (shudder!) turning off your pager for an hour to focus on a deadline? Good. Do it. And you don't have to grab those voice mail messages every time that annoying blinking light goes on. Cover up the light with a piece of paper for an hour or two. (Out of sight, out of mind.) Then, clean up the voice mail once you've gotten a good chunk of today's 'to do' list taken care of. If you're finding yourself too readily distracted by non-work related web wandering, it may not require an all-out moratorium. But try setting a limit. Say, a half hour during the lunch break. Often times, non-work related web surfing and other distractions are pursued when workers are anxious about a task at hand and seek avoidance. 4. It could very well be the job, not you. It's not uncommon, especially in today's 'here today, gone tomorrow' workforce mentality. Job jumping doesn't have the same negative stigma these days that it did in generations past. The trick is to leave before you're getting pushed out. It's much easier to find a job when you're not hitting a desperation period. Assess and act before the real trouble signs set in. Get out before the poor evaluations, blown deadlines, tardiness and undue absences set in. Most likely, in this job market, there's a company out there ready to make better use of your skills.",

      "body": "<p>If there's one thing I can't stand it's laziness,\" says Sara Barker, team manager in a direct mail advertising firm. \"It just makes me see red. I have one guy, Martin, in my team who just works as if he's got his handbrake on - it takes him twice as long to do things, he never finishes a job properly. </p> <p>\"I seem to spend my life having a go at him, sending work back, asking him to do things again - and it just never makes any difference.\" </p> <p>The first thing to define is what is causing the person to behave in this way - whether it is caused by a specific problem with the job that can be solved, or whether it is a product of more general disaffection with office life. </p> <p>\"Usually there is a good reason if someone is slacking,\" says Jane Weightman, author of Managing People . \"Often it's a 'gap' problem - where expectations and reality don't meet. It may be that the person may not have had the job explained thoroughly, may not have had sufficient training or feels undervalued.\" </p> <p>Barker admits she's not dealing with the problem, but finds it hard to control her annoyance. \"I know that ticking him off in public is a bad idea and I suppose I should take him into my office and talk it through, but I feel that I don't have anything solid to have a go at him about. He's not actually causing the department a problem - he does the work that's necessary - he just never bothers to put the effort in and do anything extra.\" </p> <p>According to Dr Stuart Metcalfe, senior lecturer in business studies at the South Bank Business School, the idea of 'having a go' is coming at the problem from the wrong angle. \"The best way to deal with this sort of situation is take the person to one side and have a quiet chat,\" he says. </p> <p>\"These kind of conversations can be awkward, but you can take the sting out of it by asking what they don't like about the company, or the job. Make it clear that you are willing to consider that the fault may be on the company's side, as well as theirs. </p> <p>\"And never, ever, tick someone off in front of their colleagues - it only causes resentment and is incredibly demotivational.\" </p> <p>Jane Weightman agrees: \"Have the conversation in private and be prepared to listen and take on board whatever the person has to say. Sometimes it may be as simple as the fact their car has failed its MOT and that's why they're late to work. Or it could be something work-related - but once you have the reason for their seeming disinterest, then you're half way to solving the problem.\" </p> <p>Nine times out of ten a chat will solve the problem - but sometimes it isn't that simple. \"I had a woman in my team recently, Monica, who just wasn't working properly - she'd come in late, take whole afternoons off for medical appointments,\" says Ian Stevenson, who heads up a team of market researchers. </p> <p>\"I suspected that she was going for interviews - and so I brought her into my office for a chat, but she denied anything was wrong.\" </p> <p>In the end Stevenson's suspicions turned out to be correct - when Monica handed in her notice. \"I felt really stupid,\" he admits. </p> <p>\"My instincts were correct but I didn't have the confidence to deal with the situation. When her performance didn't pick up after we spoke, I should have sent her a note or a memo, but I just wasn't quite sure how to do it.\" </p> <p>\"As a manager you have to decide where the lines are drawn,\" says Dr Metcalfe. \"If someone still isn't pulling their weight after you have spoken to them, then send them a memo. It keeps the matter confidential - which is hugely important - but lets them know that you are still unhappy with their performance. Again, don't make it confrontational but simply outline what the perceived problems are - timekeeping, attitude, whatever. </p> <p>\"If the situation still doesn't improve, you then have to confront it - but at least you have written proof that you have followed correct procedures.\" </p> <p><strong> If you don't remember anything else, remember this... </strong></p> <p>\"It's astonishing what people will tell you if you show interest,\" says Jane Weightman. There may be a perfectly good reason why someone isn't working to their true potential. You'll never know unless you ask.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If there's one thing I can't stand it's laziness,\" says Sara Barker, team manager in a direct mail advertising firm. \"It just makes me see red. I have one guy, Martin, in my team who just works as if he's got his handbrake on - it takes him twice as long to do things, he never finishes a job properly. \"I seem to spend my life having a go at him, sending work back, asking him to do things again - and it just never makes any difference.\" The first thing to define is what is causing the person to behave in this way - whether it is caused by a specific problem with the job that can be solved, or whether it is a product of more general disaffection with office life. \"Usually there is a good reason if someone is slacking,\" says Jane Weightman, author of Managing People . \"Often it's a 'gap' problem - where expectations and reality don't meet. It may be that the person may not have had the job explained thoroughly, may not have had sufficient training or feels undervalued.\" Barker admits she's not dealing with the problem, but finds it hard to control her annoyance. \"I know that ticking him off in public is a bad idea and I suppose I should take him into my office and talk it through, but I feel that I don't have anything solid to have a go at him about. He's not actually causing the department a problem - he does the work that's necessary - he just never bothers to put the effort in and do anything extra.\" According to Dr Stuart Metcalfe, senior lecturer in business studies at the South Bank Business School, the idea of 'having a go' is coming at the problem from the wrong angle. \"The best way to deal with this sort of situation is take the person to one side and have a quiet chat,\" he says. \"These kind of conversations can be awkward, but you can take the sting out of it by asking what they don't like about the company, or the job. Make it clear that you are willing to consider that the fault may be on the company's side, as well as theirs. \"And never, ever, tick someone off in front of their colleagues - it only causes resentment and is incredibly demotivational.\" Jane Weightman agrees: \"Have the conversation in private and be prepared to listen and take on board whatever the person has to say. Sometimes it may be as simple as the fact their car has failed its MOT and that's why they're late to work. Or it could be something work-related - but once you have the reason for their seeming disinterest, then you're half way to solving the problem.\" Nine times out of ten a chat will solve the problem - but sometimes it isn't that simple. \"I had a woman in my team recently, Monica, who just wasn't working properly - she'd come in late, take whole afternoons off for medical appointments,\" says Ian Stevenson, who heads up a team of market researchers. \"I suspected that she was going for interviews - and so I brought her into my office for a chat, but she denied anything was wrong.\" In the end Stevenson's suspicions turned out to be correct - when Monica handed in her notice. \"I felt really stupid,\" he admits. \"My instincts were correct but I didn't have the confidence to deal with the situation. When her performance didn't pick up after we spoke, I should have sent her a note or a memo, but I just wasn't quite sure how to do it.\" \"As a manager you have to decide where the lines are drawn,\" says Dr Metcalfe. \"If someone still isn't pulling their weight after you have spoken to them, then send them a memo. It keeps the matter confidential - which is hugely important - but lets them know that you are still unhappy with their performance. Again, don't make it confrontational but simply outline what the perceived problems are - timekeeping, attitude, whatever. \"If the situation still doesn't improve, you then have to confront it - but at least you have written proof that you have followed correct procedures.\" If you don't remember anything else, remember this... \"It's astonishing what people will tell you if you show interest,\" says Jane Weightman. There may be a perfectly good reason why someone isn't working to their true potential. You'll never know unless you ask.",

British company Electrotextiles is working on a keyboard made out of a 'smart fabric' which could be sewn into your trousers or skirt and a necktie that functions as a mouse. </p> <p><strong> It's a work thing:</strong> In its never- ending quest to win you the best jobs, The Guardian is creating an online recruitment service which will go live in the summer and aims to advertise opportunities across all sectors. Called workthing.com, it will \"provide an information exchange, advice and recruitment service for everyone involved in the world of work\". </p> <p><strong> Book of the week: </strong> Motivation is much more than just a few words of praise. It is an essential skill which anyone can learn, and with which you can have an indelible positive impact on yourself and on others.

Research by psychologists at Cornell University in the US suggests that incompetence actually robs people of their ability to recognise it. As a result they will often forego the training that they need or ignore second opinions which might correct their mistakes. </p> <p> <strong>Tip of the Week</strong></p> <p><strong>Appearances matter:</strong> When it comes to judging job offers, Professor Maura Belliveau, who teaches at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, has some advice. \"Don't just look at where people work. Watch how they work - simple things like how a receptionist greets strangers can be illuminating,\" she says. \"Organisations convey something about themselves in their selection of frontline staff. Companies with strong cultures stand out from the moment you walk on to the premises. And every company has stories - anecdotes that employees share with outsiders. What are the stories about? Big wins? Great service? Political battles? The stories that people inside a company share tell you a lot about the company itself.\"</p>",

British company Electrotextiles is working on a keyboard made out of a 'smart fabric' which could be sewn into your trousers or skirt and a necktie that functions as a mouse. It's a work thing: In its never- ending quest to win you the best jobs, The Guardian is creating an online recruitment service which will go live in the summer and aims to advertise opportunities across all sectors. Called workthing.com, it will \"provide an information exchange, advice and recruitment service for everyone involved in the world of work\". Book of the week: Motivation is much more than just a few words of praise. It is an essential skill which anyone can learn, and with which you can have an indelible positive impact on yourself and on others. So says Max Landsberg, whose book The Tao of Motivation can be ordered for the special price of \u00a35.99 (plus p&amp;p) from our Cultureshop on 0800 316 6102. Not so smart: Got an annoying colleague who knows less than anyone, yet thinks they know it all? Research by psychologists at Cornell University in the US suggests that incompetence actually robs people of their ability to recognise it. As a result they will often forego the training that they need or ignore second opinions which might correct their mistakes. Tip of the Week Appearances matter: When it comes to judging job offers, Professor Maura Belliveau, who teaches at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, has some advice. \"Don't just look at where people work. Watch how they work - simple things like how a receptionist greets strangers can be illuminating,\" she says. \"Organisations convey something about themselves in their selection of frontline staff. Companies with strong cultures stand out from the moment you walk on to the premises. And every company has stories - anecdotes that employees share with outsiders. What are the stories about? Big wins? Great service? Political battles? The stories that people inside a company share tell you a lot about the company itself.\"",

      "bodyText": "Speculation grew last night that the much-heralded Blair baby may arrive this morning, after Cherie Blair, the prime minister's wife, checked into London's Chelsea and Westminster hospital amid a fever of media excitement. Mrs Blair, whose official due date is next Wednesday, made her way from Downing Street to the hospital yesterday morning in a silver Ford Galaxy which was later driven away, prompting the conclusion that she had been admitted ready for the birth. No 10 sources were reduced to insisting they had no plans \"to give a running commentary on the birth\" as pressure for information on the imminent arrival mounted. Six months after news of the pregnancy leaked out, the focus on the new addition to the first family - an unexpected fourth child for Tony and Cherie Blair - has reached fever pitch, with presents and cards beginning to pile up in Downing Street. Reporters and photographers have kept vigil at the hospital all week, particularly since Mrs Blair, 45, visited briefly late on Wednesday evening after experiencing \"some discomfort\", according to No 10 sources. Mrs Blair set off for the hospital from a Downing Street side entrance shortly after 11am in a journey officials initially claimed was not connected to the birth of the baby. She arrived at the hospital avoiding waiting photographers and reporters, and was escorted to the maternity unit on the third floor. Mr Blair, meanwhile, arrived at the hospital at 8.42pm after working at Downing Street during the day. There was speculation last night that Mrs Blair would have a caesarean section this morning. Earlier this year, the fertility expert and Labour peer Lord Winston disclosed the hospital the Blairs had chosen and suggested the baby would be born by caesarean. The baby will swiftly be exposed to the full glare of publicity previouly encountered only by royal offspring. The Blairs, who make a point of their desire to preserve the privacy of their children Euan, 16, Nicky, 14 and Kathryn, 12, have said there will be only one official photo opportunity to record the arrival of their son or daughter. However, while the family has in the past invoked the press watchdog or even court injunctions to prevent media intrusion, there is no doubt that the infant will also provide a welcome political boost for a prime minister suddenly struggling in the opinion polls. Mr Blair referred to the baby during question time in the Commons for the first time last week, in answer to a question on parenting, and it is certain the child will feature in the media as the next general election approaches. Mrs Blair, who earlier this week appeared in the high court to represent the TUC in a court challenge to the government on parental leave regulations, will also face scrutiny over every decision, from whether she sticks by her plan to use real nappies rather than disposables to the childcare arrangements she makes and how soon she returns to work. The baby will make Mr Blair the first prime minister for 150 years to have fathered a child while in office. The last was the whig Lord John Russell whose son George Gilbert William Russell was born in 1848 during the first of his father's two periods as prime minister. The last prime minister to have children as young as the Blairs' was Herbert Asquith, who had an 11-year-old daughter and five-year-old son when he became prime minister in 1908.

      "trailText": "<p>William Goldman is the ultimate Hollywood screenwriter, and he has a theory to explain every aspect of movie-making, too. If only his own life had followed the script... Suzie Mackenzie plays out a reel or two with him</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Every Hollywood script will possess a number of what are known as \"character scenes\", scenes that propel the action through revelation of character. (Of course, any dramatic work will necessarily include these - only in Hollywood are they given their own special name.) These scenes are immensely useful, being both dramatic and economic. The scene in Thelma &amp; Louise, where Thelma shoots the guy in the parking lot, is a classic \"character scene\" - it spins the action in a new direction, tells us a lot about Thelma and hints at something dark and pervasive in her past. Ditto Kathy Bates's infamous ankle-breaking scene in William Goldman's screen adapt-ation of Stephen King's Misery. If we hadn't worked it out before, we now know that James Caan's character is in deep shit. </p> <p>But character scenes don't have to be violent, they can be fleeting, subtle, point to something, some particular obsession, say, that you're going to need to pick up elsewhere in the script. What follows is a \"character scene\" from my meeting with William Goldman in his baronial penthouse apartment in New York. The apartment is the former home of the late Clare Boothe Luce, playwright and editor and wife of publishing magnate Henry Luce, the founder and owner of Time, Fortune, Life, etc, and at one time one of the richest and most powerful men in America. So when I say baronial, I say it conservatively. </p> <p>The meeting had been fun. Goldman had allotted me two hours in his busy schedule which, for anyone connected with Hollywood, is generous. And Goldman is a wonderful raconteur, gossipy, irreverent to just the right degree, plus he picks his targets well. I had really enjoyed the 10-minute treatise against Andrew Lloyd Webber, the man who \"singlehandedly\" destroyed Broadway with that \"mock-opera shit he wrote\". \"But now that he's dead, I mean creatively dead, I really do believe Broadway may come back. Is that silly and sentimental of me?\" He wanted to write a piece entitled The Death Of Andrew Lloyd Webber. \"Not that I don't hope he lives another 50 years, makes more money, gets more acclaim... But creatively, he is finished. There may be a comeback but I doubt it. Even Cameron Mackintosh, one of the great producers of all time, can't save him now.\" </p> <p>Goldman loves these big sweeping statements. His \"theories\". As in, \"Let me give you my theory on...\" According to his Lloyd Webber theory, all the talented kids who should have been writing for theatre were so disillusioned by \"all that horseshit he put out for 15 years, from 1971-1986 when he was so powerful\", that they went elsewhere, mostly into the movies. Which dovetails neatly into his theory on why movies are destroying culture. Bleeding all the talent from elsewhere while not providing any diversity of entertainment. \"If you think of human experience as a pie, then the wedge Hollywood is reflecting now is getting smaller and smaller.\" </p> <p>Sure this slightly contradicts his \"big theory\" - but who's to quibble? A good theory, like a good story well told, can run and run. \"My big theory is this. We don't know why, but we know talent clusters. There were a lot of talented guys around in Russia at the turn of the 19th century; a lot of guys around Shakespeare; and in sixth-century Athens. It's always true, and in all the arts. When one guy's terrific, there will be a lot of other terrific guys around. And this last decade, the 90s, has been a period of very low talent.\" </p> <p>This is great stuff, vintage Goldman. Unassailably correct, and delivered with that glibness that he has turned almost into a poetic art. \"Hitchcock was not a great director, he was a great entertainer, and acknowledged as such until those French idiot auteurs like Truffaut came along looking to plump their own lives, looking for directors who had been ignored.\" It's his story, and he'll tell it the way he pleases, which is, to keep it simple, attend to the timing, edit out what he doesn't need. </p> <p>Not for nothing is Goldman the highest paid script doctor in Hollywood, a reputed $1 million for four weeks' work. Doctoring, editing, working out how to make the story work, is his talent. And it is not a small talent. So I sat listening to his stories. Most of which I'd read before - in his book Adventures In The Screen Trade - or was about to read in his new book, More Adventures In The Screen Trade. Not that this spoils the stories. If a story's worth telling once, it's worth telling a hundred times. </p> <p>And then this happened. Goldman suddenly, mid-sentence, mid-laugh, looked down at his Rolex, looked up at me and said in a crisp tone: \"Fifteen minutes to go.\" Just that. Fair enough, he is a busy man, he'd been generous with his time and his knowledge. He then carried on jokily as if time were no imperative at all. Five minutes to go, he got up (I know this because I now looked at my watch), walked over to his desk, picked up two books, signed them, handed them to me and walked with me down the long corridor in the apartment that leads to his lift. Two minutes to go. Let's say, 20 seconds to walk to the lift, less than a minute for it to arrive and say a jolly goodbye, 10 seconds for me to get down. He's still a good 30 seconds within his schedule. And pacing it - frame by frame by frame. </p> <p>Then, half way to the lift, the phone rings. And now he has a problem, because the phone is on the desk, 10 seconds there, 10 seconds back. Plus the conversation... he's way out of time. This is not in the script. What does he do? Look, he's a screenwriter and, as he so often has said, \"In movie terms, that makes you the lowest creature on the food chain. And they don't look down there, not unless they want something.\" It could be Ridley Scott on the phone, it could be Spielberg. He has to answer that phone. If he's clever, jiggles about a bit, he can probably fit it in. He walks briskly back, picks up the phone, listens. Says, \"No\", and then \"Yes\". Puts down the phone. We get to the lift, it arrives... He's made it. On time and to budget. </p> <p>It's a good scene and, to steal from Peter Sellers, if I were scripting it I wouldn't change a thing ...except maybe to have the lead played by Russell Crowe. No, it's a perfect scene. It reveals something that we have to know about this character to make sense of him. That he is, to quite an absurd degree, obsessed with time. I'd realised that he is an obsessive earlier when he showed me his walk-in closet with his laundered shirts tidied in piles according to colour. Think wardrobe department. And his kitchen, sparkling clean. Not surprisingly. In all the years he has lived here - \"never been used.\" He's got the set, but he is not the cook. Sure enough, coffee is ordered in. </p> <p>But now I know something else and it's crucial. He doesn't like to go outside the script. Remember the final frame of Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, where the camera holds them, suspended in that moment before death, as if somehow this story, these characters, cannot end. We can't see them die because, if the movie works, we've fallen in love with these affable rascals. Their killing is not real killing - we don't care how many Bolivian peasants go up in smoke. In this script, Goldman's version, reality is conveniently out of shot. </p> <p>Yep. It's all beginning to fit his story - in my version. </p> <p>Why does someone become a writer? Out of need, Goldman says, \"to get outside yourself.\" \"To balance the playground see-saw.\" \"Because I had the standard horse-shit upbringing.\" \"Because I want someone to look at me and say, 'He's okay,' though I don't believe it.\" \"I write out of revenge.\" Take your pick. And take it from him, he was not a born writer. When he was young he was a lousy writer, couldn't even get his stuff printed in the Oberlin College magazine. \"And I was the fiction editor.\" </p> <p>In 1953, aged 21, he got into Columbia University. \"Through pull. I knew someone who worked there. My grades weren't good enough. I was a C-plus student.\" The self-deprecation is not phoney. He loves this idea of the underdog coming up trumps. The ugly duckling who turns into the swan. Bernstein and Woodward taking on the biggest power on the planet and winning. Come to think of it, he ends that story early also, mid-way through Watergate. The audience supplies the ending. </p> <p>He started writing for the theatre, \"three flops in two years\", and fantasising about writing \"The Great American Novel\". It never occurred to him to write for movies. First, he didn't know there was such a thing as a screenwriter. \"I thought the actors made up their lines.\" And, \"Coming from where I came from, the Midwest, in the era I was born, the 30s, movies were glorious fun - Bette Davis dying or whatever. But whatever they were, they were not serious.\" Not art - and he was going to be an artist. Incidentally, he still maintains that it is generically impossible for a Hollywood movie to be art. \"Inconceivable because a Hollywood movie is by definition expensive, $75 million on average, so they go for the lowest common denominator. To try to make a movie that people may actually go and see.\" </p> <p>There followed the usual writer's trajectory. Failure, a bit of success when he was hired to write a screenplay of Flowers For Algernon, more failure when he was fired from that. \"It was a shock, I'd never been fired before.\" He had never had a job before to be fired from. He is very endearing in this way. Loves his failures. \"My successes I don't believe. I'll tell you my success theory one day.\" </p> <p>There was a bit of teaching at Princeton, but he couldn't stand living outside New York so he moved his wife Ilene and two daughters back. And somewhere around this time, in between the firing and the publication of his \"big\" novel, Boys And Girls Together - the review in the New York Times said: \"A child of nine could understand this book before he could lift it\" - he had a really unusual bit of luck. In 1966, Paul Newman said yes to Harper, Goldman's screen adaptation of Ross Macdonald's detective thriller The Moving Target. It was a hit. So when Newman got hold of another Goldman script, then called The Sundance Kid And Butch Cassidy, he didn't says yes, but he did say: \"If you ever rewrite this I'd like to take another look.\" </p> <p>Every studio in Hollywood turned it down - you can imagine how Goldman loves this bit of the story. His agent, trying to be kind, told him he didn't want to send it out again \"in the shape it's in\". So it was auctioned. But by now, with not a word changed, it had undergone that mythic transformation from duckling to swan. It was sold for $400,000 - in the mid-60s this was three times the former record for a script. It made Goldman a legend and an object of envy and vilification overnight. </p> <p>And so was conceived Goldman's other big theory. No one in Hollywood knows anything. Everything in Hollywood is fabrication, he says, with one single exception. \"Word of mouth. Studios would love to be able to fabricate word of mouth, but so far they haven't found a way. They came pretty close with The Blair Witch Project. Don't believe that horseshit that it wasn't a Hollywood movie. Sometimes a movie is so well sold that they convince you it's not Hollywood. Easy Rider was another. You're supposed to believe it was made by these guys with love in their hearts. Total shit. That was a Hollywood movie.\" </p> <p>Anyway, since nobody knows anything of what will work from one day to the next, \"Hollywood is a pretty edgy place.\" Full of actors who don't know why they are famous. \"Most of the time they are famous because they took a part that someone else turned down and the movie was unpredictably a hit.\" Full of studio executives who expect to be fired. \"Two mistakes at $75 million and you are out. You enter your leper period. So they make stars they can pay a lot of money to because they think maybe stars will help them save their jobs.\" And full of directors who are scared. Mike Nichols has just directed \"a monumental disaster\". His previous movie didn't do well. \"It's kind of a rule that directors lose it by 60 - rich, not listening anymore. Nichols is 68. And though I don't know the man, I guarantee you he is scared.\" </p> <p>But it's not always performance related. \"Here we enter the world of sex. Sometimes a studio will ordain some beautiful young man a star whether their record deserves it or not. Brad Pitt has been in flop after flop. Same as Gibson. Gere, for all his disasters, keeps getting work.\" But what's interesting is it doesn't work this way with female stars. \"Take Rene Russo. Lethal Weapon 3. In The Line Of Fire. Get Shorty. All of them hits. Then she gets the lead in Buddy and it doesn't work. No more vehicle parts for her.\" Which, on reflection, suggests he's either forgotten The Thomas Crown Affair, or doesn't consider it a \"vehicle\". </p> <p>His favourite Hollywood line is not one of his own but was told him by a studio head some years ago. \"If I'd said No to all the movies I said Yes to, and Yes to all those I said No, it would have worked out pretty much the same.\" (Actually I think Goldman is indulging in a bit of Hollywood fabrication here. That's a Goldman line if ever I heard one.) </p> <p>So what do we know about this guy, our character, up to now? That he is rich, successful, extremely funny, very astute with a good ear and an almost impeccable sense of timing. That he likes to make things fit a particular view he has in his head. And that he became a writer to hide - that's what he said, \"To get away... I write out of revenge.\" </p> <p>I don't recall exactly how it came up. I think we were talking about his brother's death and Bill Goldman said that 71 is young to die and I said it's not great but it's not catastrophic and he said that's not the view when you are 68. And then he told me his father died young. And of course I asked how. \"Not prettily.\" Age 15, Bill found him dead at home in his study, he had taken an overdose of pills. There had been no preamble, nothing, Bill says, really to explain why. His father had been successful in setting up his own business, a mail order company. The strain had made him drink more than usual. \"My take is that maybe he panicked. That he needed a foundation around him. Leading the pack made him very scared.\" </p> <p>This is the rationalisation of the adult. For the child, the young man, it must have been as if his father suddenly walked out on him. Nothing in the story to explain it. Just The End. No wonder he doesn't like endings. There is a similar sense of incredulity, of helplessness, when he describes his wife Ilene leaving him, literally walking out, after 30 years of marriage. He didn't see it coming, of course. \"It was her decision to end it, I would never have left her. I was surprised. Then I got on with it.\" But you can see why he might like to keep to the script. </p> <p> Pauline Kael, the great New Yorker film critic, and no stranger to savagery herself, once said of Goldman's work that she detected beneath its surface a strain of \"callous cruelty\". And I think she is right. It's there in the torture scene in Marathon Man; at the moment when the girl falls off the barnstormer's plane in The Great Waldo Pepper; among those blasted Bolivians. It's not exactly sadism and we are not being asked to identify with the pain - it is a kind of mawkish indulgence in pain, the flip side of his sentimentality. </p> <p>He tells a good story in his new book about the making of Misery and how he argued with director Rob Reiner to keep the ankle-breaking scene as Stephen King had written it, \"a foot lopping scene\". Goldman really wanted this scene and argued for it until Warren Beatty pointed out that if the hero's feet are cut off, that makes him a cripple, which makes him a loser, which means they'd never get a star to play the role. Indeed, Beatty declined the role. So the foot-lopping scene went and it became an ankle-breaking scene. </p> <p>It was not his decision but it was a good decision, Goldman says, because if they'd kept it, word of mouth would have killed the film because no one goes to the movies to see a man have his feet chopped off. How could Goldman, so technically brilliant, so experienced, make such an error? I think, because it's not a technical error, it's an error of sensibility. The 15-year-old kid who went into that terrible room and found his father, left something behind there. And I for one don't blame him a bit for not wanting to go back to retrieve it. </p> <p>Anyway, he is jolly now. \"As happy as I have ever been. One ages and things happen. This is a good period for me.\" He doesn't say he is in love, it's not a Goldman line - but I can tell he is. And he's just off to LA, a place he hates, \"I don't like driving\", for a meeting about another Stephen King adaptation he has finished. \"Which is going well, they like it. It's great to work on something you think might actually be made.\" His book has deservedly received rave reviews.</p> <p> We talk about recent-ish films that we've liked. Ang Lee's The Ice Storm. \"A wonderful movie. Did no business.\" The Coen brothers' Fargo. \"If I had to name the 10 best movies of the decade, I couldn't, but Fargo would be one of them.\" Everything by John Sayles. Most of Jane Campion. Being John Malkovich. \"Contains two of the best movie jokes ever. Floor 7 1/2 . And the guys being ejected out of Malkovich's brain at the New Jersey turnpike.\" American Beauty. \"What's brilliant about that film is not that Sam Mendes is a great director, we knew that already. What's brilliant is that the movie did business.\" It's a good list. It has been a good past couple of years he says. \"If every year was as good, people would stop moaning.\" </p> <p>It's only later that it occurs to me that one modern classic neither of us mentioned is Peter Weir's wonderful The Truman Show. About a man who discovers his life is the script of a TV soap. And who decides to get out, risk it, without the script </p> <p>\u0095 Which Lie Did I Tell?

      "bodyText": "Every Hollywood script will possess a number of what are known as \"character scenes\", scenes that propel the action through revelation of character. (Of course, any dramatic work will necessarily include these - only in Hollywood are they given their own special name.) These scenes are immensely useful, being both dramatic and economic. The scene in Thelma &amp; Louise, where Thelma shoots the guy in the parking lot, is a classic \"character scene\" - it spins the action in a new direction, tells us a lot about Thelma and hints at something dark and pervasive in her past. Ditto Kathy Bates's infamous ankle-breaking scene in William Goldman's screen adapt-ation of Stephen King's Misery. If we hadn't worked it out before, we now know that James Caan's character is in deep shit. But character scenes don't have to be violent, they can be fleeting, subtle, point to something, some particular obsession, say, that you're going to need to pick up elsewhere in the script. What follows is a \"character scene\" from my meeting with William Goldman in his baronial penthouse apartment in New York. The apartment is the former home of the late Clare Boothe Luce, playwright and editor and wife of publishing magnate Henry Luce, the founder and owner of Time, Fortune, Life, etc, and at one time one of the richest and most powerful men in America. So when I say baronial, I say it conservatively. The meeting had been fun. Goldman had allotted me two hours in his busy schedule which, for anyone connected with Hollywood, is generous. And Goldman is a wonderful raconteur, gossipy, irreverent to just the right degree, plus he picks his targets well. I had really enjoyed the 10-minute treatise against Andrew Lloyd Webber, the man who \"singlehandedly\" destroyed Broadway with that \"mock-opera shit he wrote\". \"But now that he's dead, I mean creatively dead, I really do believe Broadway may come back. Is that silly and sentimental of me?\" He wanted to write a piece entitled The Death Of Andrew Lloyd Webber. \"Not that I don't hope he lives another 50 years, makes more money, gets more acclaim... But creatively, he is finished. There may be a comeback but I doubt it. Even Cameron Mackintosh, one of the great producers of all time, can't save him now.\" Goldman loves these big sweeping statements. His \"theories\". As in, \"Let me give you my theory on...\" According to his Lloyd Webber theory, all the talented kids who should have been writing for theatre were so disillusioned by \"all that horseshit he put out for 15 years, from 1971-1986 when he was so powerful\", that they went elsewhere, mostly into the movies. Which dovetails neatly into his theory on why movies are destroying culture. Bleeding all the talent from elsewhere while not providing any diversity of entertainment. \"If you think of human experience as a pie, then the wedge Hollywood is reflecting now is getting smaller and smaller.\" Sure this slightly contradicts his \"big theory\" - but who's to quibble? A good theory, like a good story well told, can run and run. \"My big theory is this. We don't know why, but we know talent clusters. There were a lot of talented guys around in Russia at the turn of the 19th century; a lot of guys around Shakespeare; and in sixth-century Athens. It's always true, and in all the arts. When one guy's terrific, there will be a lot of other terrific guys around. And this last decade, the 90s, has been a period of very low talent.\" This is great stuff, vintage Goldman. Unassailably correct, and delivered with that glibness that he has turned almost into a poetic art. \"Hitchcock was not a great director, he was a great entertainer, and acknowledged as such until those French idiot auteurs like Truffaut came along looking to plump their own lives, looking for directors who had been ignored.\" It's his story, and he'll tell it the way he pleases, which is, to keep it simple, attend to the timing, edit out what he doesn't need. Not for nothing is Goldman the highest paid script doctor in Hollywood, a reputed $1 million for four weeks' work. Doctoring, editing, working out how to make the story work, is his talent. And it is not a small talent. So I sat listening to his stories. Most of which I'd read before - in his book Adventures In The Screen Trade - or was about to read in his new book, More Adventures In The Screen Trade. Not that this spoils the stories. If a story's worth telling once, it's worth telling a hundred times. And then this happened. Goldman suddenly, mid-sentence, mid-laugh, looked down at his Rolex, looked up at me and said in a crisp tone: \"Fifteen minutes to go.\" Just that. Fair enough, he is a busy man, he'd been generous with his time and his knowledge. He then carried on jokily as if time were no imperative at all. Five minutes to go, he got up (I know this because I now looked at my watch), walked over to his desk, picked up two books, signed them, handed them to me and walked with me down the long corridor in the apartment that leads to his lift. Two minutes to go. Let's say, 20 seconds to walk to the lift, less than a minute for it to arrive and say a jolly goodbye, 10 seconds for me to get down. He's still a good 30 seconds within his schedule. And pacing it - frame by frame by frame. Then, half way to the lift, the phone rings. And now he has a problem, because the phone is on the desk, 10 seconds there, 10 seconds back. Plus the conversation... he's way out of time. This is not in the script. What does he do? Look, he's a screenwriter and, as he so often has said, \"In movie terms, that makes you the lowest creature on the food chain. And they don't look down there, not unless they want something.\" It could be Ridley Scott on the phone, it could be Spielberg. He has to answer that phone. If he's clever, jiggles about a bit, he can probably fit it in. He walks briskly back, picks up the phone, listens. Says, \"No\", and then \"Yes\". Puts down the phone. We get to the lift, it arrives... He's made it. On time and to budget. It's a good scene and, to steal from Peter Sellers, if I were scripting it I wouldn't change a thing ...except maybe to have the lead played by Russell Crowe. No, it's a perfect scene. It reveals something that we have to know about this character to make sense of him. That he is, to quite an absurd degree, obsessed with time. I'd realised that he is an obsessive earlier when he showed me his walk-in closet with his laundered shirts tidied in piles according to colour. Think wardrobe department. And his kitchen, sparkling clean. Not surprisingly. In all the years he has lived here - \"never been used.\" He's got the set, but he is not the cook. Sure enough, coffee is ordered in. But now I know something else and it's crucial. He doesn't like to go outside the script. Remember the final frame of Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, where the camera holds them, suspended in that moment before death, as if somehow this story, these characters, cannot end. We can't see them die because, if the movie works, we've fallen in love with these affable rascals. Their killing is not real killing - we don't care how many Bolivian peasants go up in smoke. In this script, Goldman's version, reality is conveniently out of shot. Yep. It's all beginning to fit his story - in my version. Why does someone become a writer? Out of need, Goldman says, \"to get outside yourself.\" \"To balance the playground see-saw.\" \"Because I had the standard horse-shit upbringing.\" \"Because I want someone to look at me and say, 'He's okay,' though I don't believe it.\" \"I write out of revenge.\" Take your pick. And take it from him, he was not a born writer. When he was young he was a lousy writer, couldn't even get his stuff printed in the Oberlin College magazine. \"And I was the fiction editor.\" In 1953, aged 21, he got into Columbia University. \"Through pull. I knew someone who worked there. My grades weren't good enough. I was a C-plus student.\" The self-deprecation is not phoney. He loves this idea of the underdog coming up trumps. The ugly duckling who turns into the swan. Bernstein and Woodward taking on the biggest power on the planet and winning. Come to think of it, he ends that story early also, mid-way through Watergate. The audience supplies the ending. He started writing for the theatre, \"three flops in two years\", and fantasising about writing \"The Great American Novel\". It never occurred to him to write for movies. First, he didn't know there was such a thing as a screenwriter. \"I thought the actors made up their lines.\" And, \"Coming from where I came from, the Midwest, in the era I was born, the 30s, movies were glorious fun - Bette Davis dying or whatever. But whatever they were, they were not serious.\" Not art - and he was going to be an artist. Incidentally, he still maintains that it is generically impossible for a Hollywood movie to be art. \"Inconceivable because a Hollywood movie is by definition expensive, $75 million on average, so they go for the lowest common denominator. To try to make a movie that people may actually go and see.\" There followed the usual writer's trajectory. Failure, a bit of success when he was hired to write a screenplay of Flowers For Algernon, more failure when he was fired from that. \"It was a shock, I'd never been fired before.\" He had never had a job before to be fired from. He is very endearing in this way. Loves his failures. \"My successes I don't believe. I'll tell you my success theory one day.\" There was a bit of teaching at Princeton, but he couldn't stand living outside New York so he moved his wife Ilene and two daughters back. And somewhere around this time, in between the firing and the publication of his \"big\" novel, Boys And Girls Together - the review in the New York Times said: \"A child of nine could understand this book before he could lift it\" - he had a really unusual bit of luck. In 1966, Paul Newman said yes to Harper, Goldman's screen adaptation of Ross Macdonald's detective thriller The Moving Target. It was a hit. So when Newman got hold of another Goldman script, then called The Sundance Kid And Butch Cassidy, he didn't says yes, but he did say: \"If you ever rewrite this I'd like to take another look.\" Every studio in Hollywood turned it down - you can imagine how Goldman loves this bit of the story. His agent, trying to be kind, told him he didn't want to send it out again \"in the shape it's in\". So it was auctioned. But by now, with not a word changed, it had undergone that mythic transformation from duckling to swan. It was sold for $400,000 - in the mid-60s this was three times the former record for a script.

Constituents demand more from their representatives.\"</p> <p>Although she said her decision had not been influenced by the birth in January of her twins Karl and Natasha, the lack of facilities at Westminster clearly played a part.</p> <p>\"The lack of child care facilities does make life difficult for any MP with children, as it does for the thousands of staff at Westminster,\" she said. \"But it is not the main reason I intend to leave parliament.\"</p> <p>The Palace of Westminster has no creche, no allocated place to feed babies and no dedicated facilities for the children of MPs or staff.</p> <p>Ms Kingham, who also has a four-year-old daughter, Rosa, recently joined the Swindon South MP Julia Drown to call for childcare in parliament</p> <p>She said: \"I do not mind working long hours and sitting in debates all night if they are a worthwhile contribution to democracy.

      "bodyText": "The failure of Tony Blair's administration to act on pledges to reform House of Commons hours was highlighted last night when one of the record new intake of female MPs announced she was standing down at the next election. Tess Kingham last night confirmed to party members in her Gloucester constituency that she would not seek reselection after becoming disillusioned with parliamentary life in her three years as an MP. She said: \"I wish to work in a modern parliament that enables me to deliver the best for the people of Gloucester. I do not want to work in a gentleman's club. \"The practices and culture of parliament are suited to a 19th century institution when well-heeled men did a day job then popped along to the Commons to do a bit of politics and enjoy the restaurants and bars. \"The job of an MP in the 21st century is totally different. Constituents demand more from their representatives.\" Although she said her decision had not been influenced by the birth in January of her twins Karl and Natasha, the lack of facilities at Westminster clearly played a part. \"The lack of child care facilities does make life difficult for any MP with children, as it does for the thousands of staff at Westminster,\" she said. \"But it is not the main reason I intend to leave parliament.\" The Palace of Westminster has no creche, no allocated place to feed babies and no dedicated facilities for the children of MPs or staff. Ms Kingham, who also has a four-year-old daughter, Rosa, recently joined the Swindon South MP Julia Drown to call for childcare in parliament She said: \"I do not mind working long hours and sitting in debates all night if they are a worthwhile contribution to democracy. To debate the minimum wage, Kosovo, trade union rights or other important matters of genuine political disagreement is stimulating and worthwhile. \"That is what MPs are there for. Unfortunately, much of the late night debating in parliament is not worthwhile. I am not willing to sit up all night for schoolboy politics. \"The little boys who indulge in this may think it is 'a laugh', but to me it is insulting to my constituents and no way to govern in the 21st century.\" Her case highlights a growing number of MPs at Westminster who have attacked the hours and conditions in the Commons amid growing disappointment at the unwillingness of senior party figures to push for real reform. In yesterday's Guardian, the Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, Oona King, warned that her colleague's decision to stand down should not be read as \"proof that women with young children can't cope with Westminster\". She wrote: \"In fact, it highlights the more significant point that Westminster can't cope with well-balanced human beings.\" The Labour backbencher Harriet Harman argues that the Commons could start sitting early in the day and finish at 7pm or even earlier without losing business time. The argument against such rescheduling holds that it is supported only by London MPs who can then go home in the evenings. The Labour chief whip, Ann Taylor, and the leader of the house, Margaret Beckett, are widely seen by disenchanted party colleagues as key forces blocking reform, but both claim that moves to change the Commons timetabling on Thursdays for an early start and finish must bed down before further reform can be considered.",

      "bodyText": "Through the centuries, healing has been practised by folk healers who are guided by traditional wisdom... No one could be stupid enough to deny the enormous benefits which the advances of medical science in this century have conferred... the fact remains that contemporary medicine as a whole tends to be fascinated by the objective, statistical, computerised approach to the healing of the sick. - speech marking 150th anniversary of the British Medical Association, 1982 At the core of Christianity there still lies an integral view of the sanctity of the world, and a clear sense of the trusteeship and responsibility given to us for our natural surroundings. But the west gradually lost this integrated vision of the world with Copernicus and Descartes and the coming of the scientific revolution. - speech at Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, 1993 It is as if tradition represented the enemy of man's lofty ambition; the \"primitive\" force which acts as an unwelcome reminder, deep in our subconscious, of the ultimate folly of believing that the purpose and meaning of life on this earth lie in creating a material form of utopia - a world in which technology becomes a \"virtual reality\" god; the arbiter of virtual reality ethics - and thus the eventual murderer of the soul of mankind. Tradition reflects the timeless order, and yet disorder, of the cosmos and anchors us into a harmonious relationship with the great mysteries of the universe. Some scientists claim to have discovered the origins of the universe and explain it all quite confidently in terms of a big bang. If it was a big bang, then I suggest it was a controlled explosion. - speech to InvestCorp dinner, July 1996 During the last three centuries, in the western world at least, a dangerous division has come into being in the way we perceive the world around us. Science has tried to assume a monopoly - even a tyranny - over our understanding. Religion and science have become separated... Science has attempted to take over the natural world from God. - speech on building bridges between Islam and the west, December 1996 We should show greater respect for the genius of nature's designs... refined over millions of years. This means being careful to use science to understand how nature works, not to change what nature is, as we do when genetic manipulation seeks to transform the process of biological evolution into something altogether different. - BBC lecture, 2000",

      "body": "<p>Here we are again in the midst of yet another make or break moment in the Northern Ireland peace process. In a week the fate of the Good Friday agreement will be in the hands of the 800-odd members of the Ulster Unionist council. They will have to decide on whether to return to Stormont's power-sharing executive. The postponement gives David Trimble's team time to work on the crucial 200 or so undecided members - an important breathing space given the efficiency and speed with which the anti-agreement camp have been campaigning for the last week with glossy leaflets and phone canvassing. It is also make or break for Mr Trimble's leadership. Pull this off, and he has resolved the questions arising from the previous leadership challenge earlier in the spring.</p> <p>Mr Trimble's failure to embrace and promote the IRA's statement on decommissioning has been frustrating and allowed his hardliners to make mischief. In place of persuasion he has appeared to spend much of the past 10 days asking for clarifications and wringing concessions (on flags and names) from the British government. If this negotiation helps him convince his council he is no pushover, then one may end up applauding a shrewd understanding of his side's insecurities. There has been some frustration in London and Dublin that Unionists too often get stuck on the detail. Why, they ask, cannot Mr Trimble inspire his troops with the big picture? Mr Trimble's strategy has been aptly described as the politics of resignation rather than of inspiration.

      "bodyText": "Here we are again in the midst of yet another make or break moment in the Northern Ireland peace process. In a week the fate of the Good Friday agreement will be in the hands of the 800-odd members of the Ulster Unionist council. They will have to decide on whether to return to Stormont's power-sharing executive. The postponement gives David Trimble's team time to work on the crucial 200 or so undecided members - an important breathing space given the efficiency and speed with which the anti-agreement camp have been campaigning for the last week with glossy leaflets and phone canvassing. It is also make or break for Mr Trimble's leadership. Pull this off, and he has resolved the questions arising from the previous leadership challenge earlier in the spring. Mr Trimble's failure to embrace and promote the IRA's statement on decommissioning has been frustrating and allowed his hardliners to make mischief. In place of persuasion he has appeared to spend much of the past 10 days asking for clarifications and wringing concessions (on flags and names) from the British government. If this negotiation helps him convince his council he is no pushover, then one may end up applauding a shrewd understanding of his side's insecurities. There has been some frustration in London and Dublin that Unionists too often get stuck on the detail. Why, they ask, cannot Mr Trimble inspire his troops with the big picture? Mr Trimble's strategy has been aptly described as the politics of resignation rather than of inspiration. But perhaps he knows best how to coax his party into peace; after all, the big picture - power-sharing which entails decisions such as Barbre de Bruin's siting of Belfast's main maternity hospital in a Catholic area - often horrifies an insecure community. The concessions that the British government has been producing this week like white rabbits from a hat at a children's tea party, have meanwhile infuriated nationalists.

This is all about to change, however, because Mr Prudence has commissioned Bates - the company that designed the No 10 site - to give the Treasury's dreary web pages a makeover. Look forward then in three months to a history of boom and bust and 10 things you never knew about Dawn Primarolo. </p> <p>\u0095 At the other end of the town, the Bank of England has a problem with inflation - the quarterly inflation report is getting so big that it will soon be too fat to staple together. The first report in February 1993 was a model of Hemingway-like brevity, a terse 48 pages; the latest clocked in at a Joycean 98 pages, but was at least a better read. </p> <p>Bank insiders say the choice is to cut down the size of the report by removing the minutes of the meetings of the monetary policy committee to another publication, or give up altogether and turn the report into a book, with a proper spine. </p> <p>\u0095 Underside was sorry to have missed the champagne luncheon sponsored by \"dynamic accountants\" Baker Tilly, and that riveting periodical Tax Journal, at which Peter Mason, the Abbey National's internationally feared group VAT director, was hailed as Britain's first \"VATrat of the year\". </p> <p>This coveted award (the title has something to do with Hong Kong and the Chinese year of the rat) goes to the suit achieving a landmark VAT decision. Mason - according to his citation - has been the scourge not just of the high court and the European court of justice, but the VAT and duties tribunal to boot. </p> <p>According to Baker Tilly, \"the usually sober VAT community fizzed\" when the magic envelope was opened. Of course it did. </p> <p>\u0095 Talking of rats, there was much merriment over the port and cigars at the CBI's annual dinner when Rentokil supremo Sir Clive Thompson said that the former bosses' boss at Centrepoint, Adair Turner, was now in a garret somewhere working on a definitive 800-page tome about \"fiscal rectitude\". </p> <p>Suspicions that some of the CBI's members found Turner a bit too clever (and left-wing) for his own good were confirmed by the belly laughs that greeted the boast by Sir Clive - not perhaps everyone's first choice for \"phone a friend\" - that he was now planning a slim 200-page autobiography, called Rats to Riches and Back Again, to give Turner a run for his money. Meeow. </p> <p>\u0095 Listeners to the Today programme this week were treated to a vintage Clare Short performance.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Forget all that stuff about Tony and Gordon falling out over the euro, the real rivalry between the first and second lords of the Treasury is over who has the best website. At the moment, No 10 is winning hands down, with its all singing, all dancing affair that allows visitors to embark on their tour of the corridors of power. By contrast, this week's \"highlights\" on the Treasury site are the launch of the Myners study into institutional investment and the full text of the chancellor's speech to the Child Poverty Action Group. This is all about to change, however, because Mr Prudence has commissioned Bates - the company that designed the No 10 site - to give the Treasury's dreary web pages a makeover. Look forward then in three months to a history of boom and bust and 10 things you never knew about Dawn Primarolo. \u0095 At the other end of the town, the Bank of England has a problem with inflation - the quarterly inflation report is getting so big that it will soon be too fat to staple together. The first report in February 1993 was a model of Hemingway-like brevity, a terse 48 pages; the latest clocked in at a Joycean 98 pages, but was at least a better read. Bank insiders say the choice is to cut down the size of the report by removing the minutes of the meetings of the monetary policy committee to another publication, or give up altogether and turn the report into a book, with a proper spine. \u0095 Underside was sorry to have missed the champagne luncheon sponsored by \"dynamic accountants\" Baker Tilly, and that riveting periodical Tax Journal, at which Peter Mason, the Abbey National's internationally feared group VAT director, was hailed as Britain's first \"VATrat of the year\". This coveted award (the title has something to do with Hong Kong and the Chinese year of the rat) goes to the suit achieving a landmark VAT decision. Mason - according to his citation - has been the scourge not just of the high court and the European court of justice, but the VAT and duties tribunal to boot. According to Baker Tilly, \"the usually sober VAT community fizzed\" when the magic envelope was opened. Of course it did. \u0095 Talking of rats, there was much merriment over the port and cigars at the CBI's annual dinner when Rentokil supremo Sir Clive Thompson said that the former bosses' boss at Centrepoint, Adair Turner, was now in a garret somewhere working on a definitive 800-page tome about \"fiscal rectitude\". Suspicions that some of the CBI's members found Turner a bit too clever (and left-wing) for his own good were confirmed by the belly laughs that greeted the boast by Sir Clive - not perhaps everyone's first choice for \"phone a friend\" - that he was now planning a slim 200-page autobiography, called Rats to Riches and Back Again, to give Turner a run for his money. Meeow. \u0095 Listeners to the Today programme this week were treated to a vintage Clare Short performance. The international development secretary did a quick interview on the way to the airport in which she slated the European Union as the world's most useless development agency, riven by petty nationalistic rivalries, riddled with bureaucratic delays, wasting billions of euros, etc etc. All absolutely true, of course, and made even better by the fact that Ms Short was en route to Brussels that day. Good to see she hasn't lost her touch. \u0095 Meanwhile, the Japanese have come up with a wizard wheeze to prevent Jubilee 2000 campaigners from turning up en masse for the their annual demo at the G7 heads of government shindig. The smart boys in Tokyo are holding the summit on Okinawa and the cost of jetting to an island in the middle of the Pacific is proving prohibitively expensive for the J2000 stalwarts who formed human chains in Birmingham and Cologne.

Chairman Philip Swinstead said yesterday: \"Everyone in the industry is debating when the traditional market will come back, but no one can say exactly when.\" The situation will change he said \"as large bricks and mortar companies shift from the pilot stage of e-business projects to full implementation of interfaces\". He added that Parity has \"been shifting the overall focus of the group to e-business,\" citing last year's purchase of TMS Information Solutions, a knowledge-management systems company, and December's acquisition of web designer Interactive Developments. In March, shares in Parity hit a peak of 720p before being caught in the general technology rout. Yesterday, the price slid another 47p to 158p.",

Mr Spellar is known to have been one of the home secretary's strongest supporters to retain secrecy in government when the bill was discussed in cabinet committee.</p> <p>The requests for the release of the information were made by Michael Tapper, father of one of the pilots, Jonathan Tapper, and were pressed by Robert Key, Tory MP for Salisbury and a junior defence spokesman.</p> <p>Mr Tapper and John Cook, the father of the second pilot, Rick Cook, have been fighting to clear their sons' names of the blame for the 1994 crash, which the ministry has insisted was not due to any malfunction. But it has always refused to release any reports.</p> <p>Mr Tapper sought the airworthiness report because it was a full-scale assessment of the RAF Chinook carried out by Boscombe Down, the ministry's main air research centre, before the helicopter went into service. The helicopter tested was an identical model to the one that crashed. The National Audit Office, parliament's financial watchdog, has referred to the report in an investigation on defence procurement because it called for the helicopter's computer software to be rewritten before it went into service.</p> <p>Release of the report would call into question the ministry's judgment on whether it should have gone into service.</p> <p>The US report reveals details of an incident when a US army version of the helicopter rolled over and flew upside down until the pilots were able to regain control. After Mr Key failed to get the ministry to release the report, an application was made under the US freedom of information act, and the report has been passed to the families.</p> <p>Mr Tapper has appealed against the first ruling and is to take the case to the parliamentary ombudsman.</p> <p>Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, said: \"I can't see how a technical report on the airworthiness of a helicopter before it goes into service can be classified as policy advice. This smells of a cover-up.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Ministry of Defence has used the government's new freedom of information code to ban the release of two confidential reports to the families of pilots blamed for the Chinook helicopter crash off the Mull of Kintyre which left 25 members of the security services dead. In a decision that would be unaffected by the freedom of information bill that becomes law later this year, John Spellar, junior defence minister, has refused to release an airworthiness report on the Chinook because he says it is policy advice, and a report on an incident involving an American Chinook because it was supplied in confidence by a foreign government. Both justifications will still apply when the bill becomes law this year, because Jack Straw, home secretary, has imposed blanket bans on policy advice and information provided by third parties. Mr Spellar is known to have been one of the home secretary's strongest supporters to retain secrecy in government when the bill was discussed in cabinet committee. The requests for the release of the information were made by Michael Tapper, father of one of the pilots, Jonathan Tapper, and were pressed by Robert Key, Tory MP for Salisbury and a junior defence spokesman. Mr Tapper and John Cook, the father of the second pilot, Rick Cook, have been fighting to clear their sons' names of the blame for the 1994 crash, which the ministry has insisted was not due to any malfunction. But it has always refused to release any reports. Mr Tapper sought the airworthiness report because it was a full-scale assessment of the RAF Chinook carried out by Boscombe Down, the ministry's main air research centre, before the helicopter went into service. The helicopter tested was an identical model to the one that crashed. The National Audit Office, parliament's financial watchdog, has referred to the report in an investigation on defence procurement because it called for the helicopter's computer software to be rewritten before it went into service. Release of the report would call into question the ministry's judgment on whether it should have gone into service. The US report reveals details of an incident when a US army version of the helicopter rolled over and flew upside down until the pilots were able to regain control. After Mr Key failed to get the ministry to release the report, an application was made under the US freedom of information act, and the report has been passed to the families. Mr Tapper has appealed against the first ruling and is to take the case to the parliamentary ombudsman. Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, said: \"I can't see how a technical report on the airworthiness of a helicopter before it goes into service can be classified as policy advice. This smells of a cover-up.\"",

With negotiations between ministers over this summer's spending review reaching their climax, Labour MPs said Gordon Brown could afford to be more generous than the plans laid out in last month's Budget. Amid concern over this year's 75p increase in pensions, one senior backbencher said last night: \"Gordon has been in real trouble in the party following the local election results.

This was almost three times the amount expected in the City and the biggest April surplus on record. Although the figures were artificially boosted by tobacco manufacturers paying customs and excise duty early, to avoid an expected increase in the Budget, economists said they underlined the rude health of the public finances. \"The strength of the public finances means the progressive loosening of the fiscal stance unveiled in this year's Budget can easily be afforded without jeopardising the chancellor's fiscal rules,\" said Richard Iley, of the Dutch bank ABN Amro.

Mr Branson said he aimed to replicate worldwide the British success of Virgin Mobile, which has 250,000 customers six months after launch. \"We want to try and be the first truly global mobile phone company and the deal with SingTel is a step towards that,\" he said. </p> <p>The pan-Asian venture will follow the British business model by repackaging SingTel airtime under the Virgin brand name.

      "byline": "Michael White Political editor",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>At any time in the past few months, a sensible betting MP might have put a fiver on Mo Mowlam leaving Tony Blair's government at the next reshuffle and done so at ever-diminishing odds. No two people quite agreed what was going wrong in New Labour's love affair with Mo, but clearly something was.</p> <p>Then the Guardian's annual ICM poll on the cabinet popularity ratings this week confirmed what ordinary voters-in-the-street, from her Redcar constituency to the Falls Road in Belfast, could have told the government for free: Dr Mowlam remains its most popular asset at a time when it is becoming less lovable in the eyes of many voters.</p> <p>\"She came to my constituency and she was quite literally mobbed. People love Mo,\" recalls one cabinet colleague who admires her enormously. \"We'd be mad not to use her talents and popularity properly.\"</p> <p>\"Mo?,\" says another senior minister. \"She's behaving like a rogue elephant and acting in a pretty dumb way at present.\"</p> <p>The Guardian/ICM poll clearly suggests that 58% of voters agree with the first minister even though few know very clearly what her progress-chasing, joined-up-government role at the Cabinet Office involves. Her profile - even on the Today programme - has been lower than expected.</p> <p>But the second minister also has a point, although it is little understood outside government. Even Mo's admirers know she can be difficult.</p> <p>\"It has never been easy to fit Mo into the right job, that was true even in opposition,\" says one. She herself acknowledges her populist instincts and even the comparison some people make between her and Ken Livingstone: easier to admire at a distance than close up. \"In some ways Mo is above politics, she's anti-politics,\" concedes a Labour apparatchik.</p> <p>But what about all those newspaper stories suggesting that Downing Street is out to get Mo because she is so popular that Tony Blair is jealous? The thesis was explicitly endorsed by Channel 4's recent Rise and Fall of Mo Mowlam. Mo was discarded because she was \"a popularity threat,\" said leftwing MP, Alan Simpson and others.</p> <p>The main culprit fingered for spreading the poison was the prime minister's chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, who was also blamed for upsetting Frank Dobson. Mr Powell denies the villain's role, and Mowlam - who took the trouble to buy him a drink in a Westminster corner on Tuesday night - says she does not blame him either. True or false? There is conflicting evidence.</p> <p>Indeed some evidence suggests that Mo herself likes to talk about her troubles rather than to bottle them up and that at least some of the media gossip has been generated by her talking aloud about her perceived tormentors or letting her chums do so.</p> <p>Thus a front page story in the Independent on Sunday is said to have been the result of a heart-to-heart with the paper's editor, Janet Street-Porter, who wanted to flush out those shadowy whisperers. Yet those closest to Mr Blair are not easily caught playing the whispering game.</p> <p>Mo has hinted that she is not enamoured of much of the machinery-of-government stuff. She loves the anti-drugs crusade, but it is well known that her views are more liberal than Mr Blair's. \"Is it a big enough job for Mo? I don't know,\" says one of the big players in the Blair team. \"She has an appeal and talent that is unique in politics. We've got to find a way to make better use of it.\" That hardly sounds as if a P45 is being prepared in the No 10 accounts department.</p> <p>Others have argued that it is Mowlam who has had enough, not the other way round. Her banker husband, Jon, lost his job last year - hence the \u00a3350,000 future memoirs deal to cheer up the bank manager - and friends wonder whether she is fully recovered from that very public brain tumour.</p> <p>There again, they admit, Mo was always wayward, a rule-breaker, perfectly capable of pinching someone's pint or - in an interview incident - a woman journalist's bangles.</p> <p>That is why folk love Mo. Her spontaneity is real.

      "bodyText": "At any time in the past few months, a sensible betting MP might have put a fiver on Mo Mowlam leaving Tony Blair's government at the next reshuffle and done so at ever-diminishing odds. No two people quite agreed what was going wrong in New Labour's love affair with Mo, but clearly something was. Then the Guardian's annual ICM poll on the cabinet popularity ratings this week confirmed what ordinary voters-in-the-street, from her Redcar constituency to the Falls Road in Belfast, could have told the government for free: Dr Mowlam remains its most popular asset at a time when it is becoming less lovable in the eyes of many voters. \"She came to my constituency and she was quite literally mobbed. People love Mo,\" recalls one cabinet colleague who admires her enormously. \"We'd be mad not to use her talents and popularity properly.\" \"Mo?,\" says another senior minister. \"She's behaving like a rogue elephant and acting in a pretty dumb way at present.\" The Guardian/ICM poll clearly suggests that 58% of voters agree with the first minister even though few know very clearly what her progress-chasing, joined-up-government role at the Cabinet Office involves. Her profile - even on the Today programme - has been lower than expected. But the second minister also has a point, although it is little understood outside government. Even Mo's admirers know she can be difficult. \"It has never been easy to fit Mo into the right job, that was true even in opposition,\" says one. She herself acknowledges her populist instincts and even the comparison some people make between her and Ken Livingstone: easier to admire at a distance than close up. \"In some ways Mo is above politics, she's anti-politics,\" concedes a Labour apparatchik. But what about all those newspaper stories suggesting that Downing Street is out to get Mo because she is so popular that Tony Blair is jealous? The thesis was explicitly endorsed by Channel 4's recent Rise and Fall of Mo Mowlam. Mo was discarded because she was \"a popularity threat,\" said leftwing MP, Alan Simpson and others. The main culprit fingered for spreading the poison was the prime minister's chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, who was also blamed for upsetting Frank Dobson. Mr Powell denies the villain's role, and Mowlam - who took the trouble to buy him a drink in a Westminster corner on Tuesday night - says she does not blame him either. True or false? There is conflicting evidence. Indeed some evidence suggests that Mo herself likes to talk about her troubles rather than to bottle them up and that at least some of the media gossip has been generated by her talking aloud about her perceived tormentors or letting her chums do so. Thus a front page story in the Independent on Sunday is said to have been the result of a heart-to-heart with the paper's editor, Janet Street-Porter, who wanted to flush out those shadowy whisperers. Yet those closest to Mr Blair are not easily caught playing the whispering game. Mo has hinted that she is not enamoured of much of the machinery-of-government stuff. She loves the anti-drugs crusade, but it is well known that her views are more liberal than Mr Blair's. \"Is it a big enough job for Mo? I don't know,\" says one of the big players in the Blair team. \"She has an appeal and talent that is unique in politics. We've got to find a way to make better use of it.\" That hardly sounds as if a P45 is being prepared in the No 10 accounts department. Others have argued that it is Mowlam who has had enough, not the other way round. Her banker husband, Jon, lost his job last year - hence the \u00a3350,000 future memoirs deal to cheer up the bank manager - and friends wonder whether she is fully recovered from that very public brain tumour. There again, they admit, Mo was always wayward, a rule-breaker, perfectly capable of pinching someone's pint or - in an interview incident - a woman journalist's bangles. That is why folk love Mo. Her spontaneity is real. The journalist, Julia Langdon, who is completing her biography, contradicts Mowlam's own explanation of her popularity - Belfast and the illness. \"Her popularity isn't about either as such. It's about the way she handled them both,\" says Ms Langdon. The jury is still out on Mowlam's role in brokering the Good Friday agreement. Her shrewd deputy, Paul Murphy, now Welsh secretary, has been heard to say \"No Mo, no peace process,\" and her style won many friends in Northern Ireland, especially on the nationalist and republican side of the conflict.

      "body": "<p>After all my moaning about what's awful in this country, a thick new book plops on to my desk - Roger Protz's Britain's 500 Best Pubs. Protz makes the point that the unsung revolution in pubs is the food - \"no longer synonymous with stale sandwiches, packet soup, instant whipped potatoes and vegetarian lasagne. Marvellous food is now being served the length of the land.\" </p> <p>He's right; country pubs are leading the way. The other day in one of his choices, the Dundas Arms in Berkshire, I had hot smoked salmon with Jersey royals and courgette cream which would have been the speciality in any West End restaurant, but at twice the price. </p> <p>But it's not just the food. Bit by bit, muzak and juke boxes are disappearing. Three or four real ales are often available. Children are increasingly welcome anywhere in the pub. Most amazing, some car parks are being grassed over to make beer gardens, with rickety tables and umbrellas that collapse on to your drink. It's not all perfect. </p> <p>Possibly the tough drink driving laws mean that people can't go to country pubs to get wellied, and are happy to spend the money on good food instead. Either way, we all benefit. </p> <p>\u0095 Gosh, Welsh people are sensitive. I didn't say last week that the language is only used to abuse English tourists covertly, merely that it does happen. As it did to my friend, bilingual Tim Jones of the Times. He took an English friend to a north Wales pub where they played darts with the locals, who were smiling and friendly. But, in Welsh, they were crude and offensive about the visitors. After the game, Tim thanked them warmly in English, then let rip with a tirade of abuse in perfect Welsh. It must have been a hugely satisfying moment. </p> <p>And the late, much lamented, John Harrison, who was BBC correspondent in South Africa, had a Greek mother. He once held a birthday party in a Greek restaurant in London, and the evening ended with traditional plate-smashing. He was appalled to see that they had charged him \u00a31 a plate - a fortune then - on the bill. After a blast of Greek which would have brought a blush to the cheek of a Piraeus docker, they cut it down to 10p a plate. </p> <p>Reader Mark Williamson of Milton Keynes sends an extract from Alan Garner's memoirs, The Voice That Thunders. Garner was a classicist at school and on a trip he and his friends stopped at a shop in Tomen-y-Mur. The customers immediately switched from English to Welsh. \"Our form master then asked us, in Greek, what we wanted to buy. So, for possibly the first time in Wales, a shopping list was drawn up in Attic Greek, to total silence from the other customers. Then to add insult to injury, the master conveyed the requirements to the shopkeeper in fluent Welsh.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The other day I went to some big launch, backed by the prime minister, to persuade young persons to become entrepreneurs. There in the audience, smiling happily, was our own most famous entrepreneur, Sir Richard Branson. That very day the Guardian carried a report that Branson had been forced to apologise for sending threatening lawyers' letters to Australian firms called Virgin, which had had the temerity to wish to carry on trading under their old names even after Sir Richard had launched his internal airline, Virgin Blue. Outrageous behaviour! I gather the Catholic Church still talks about the Virgin Mary: stiff missive on its way from Sir Richard there. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Roger Virgin phones from Wales. He is a carpenter who has been trading as Virgin Building Services for 20 years. Such impudence was naturally rewarded by another bullying letter. Sir Richard assured me that the matter had been settled, but Roger Virgin is angry because so far he hasn't received any apology, either for the ludicrous letter, or for their derogatory implication that his building firm was on a level with Virgin services, eg their trains. Next month he is off on a bike ride from St Malo to Nantes, in aid of the NSPCC. It would be appropriate if Sir Richard sponsored him very generously. If he does I shall be happy to record the fact. </p> <p>\u0095 Congratulations to the BBC for declining to show live the Queen Mother's birthday celebrations. It's largely a corporate stunt, and if anyone cares they can watch it on ITV. (Did you know that, although the BBC wiped almost all the tapes of the sensationally funny Dud 'n' Pete show, Not Only But Also, they have every single Trooping Of The Colour preserved - a treasured memento of what?) </p> <p>But the royals have largely lost the plot.

      "bodyText": "After all my moaning about what's awful in this country, a thick new book plops on to my desk - Roger Protz's Britain's 500 Best Pubs. Protz makes the point that the unsung revolution in pubs is the food - \"no longer synonymous with stale sandwiches, packet soup, instant whipped potatoes and vegetarian lasagne. Marvellous food is now being served the length of the land.\" He's right; country pubs are leading the way. The other day in one of his choices, the Dundas Arms in Berkshire, I had hot smoked salmon with Jersey royals and courgette cream which would have been the speciality in any West End restaurant, but at twice the price. But it's not just the food. Bit by bit, muzak and juke boxes are disappearing. Three or four real ales are often available. Children are increasingly welcome anywhere in the pub. Most amazing, some car parks are being grassed over to make beer gardens, with rickety tables and umbrellas that collapse on to your drink. It's not all perfect. Possibly the tough drink driving laws mean that people can't go to country pubs to get wellied, and are happy to spend the money on good food instead. Either way, we all benefit. \u0095 Gosh, Welsh people are sensitive. I didn't say last week that the language is only used to abuse English tourists covertly, merely that it does happen. As it did to my friend, bilingual Tim Jones of the Times. He took an English friend to a north Wales pub where they played darts with the locals, who were smiling and friendly. But, in Welsh, they were crude and offensive about the visitors. After the game, Tim thanked them warmly in English, then let rip with a tirade of abuse in perfect Welsh. It must have been a hugely satisfying moment. And the late, much lamented, John Harrison, who was BBC correspondent in South Africa, had a Greek mother. He once held a birthday party in a Greek restaurant in London, and the evening ended with traditional plate-smashing. He was appalled to see that they had charged him \u00a31 a plate - a fortune then - on the bill. After a blast of Greek which would have brought a blush to the cheek of a Piraeus docker, they cut it down to 10p a plate. Reader Mark Williamson of Milton Keynes sends an extract from Alan Garner's memoirs, The Voice That Thunders. Garner was a classicist at school and on a trip he and his friends stopped at a shop in Tomen-y-Mur. The customers immediately switched from English to Welsh. \"Our form master then asked us, in Greek, what we wanted to buy. So, for possibly the first time in Wales, a shopping list was drawn up in Attic Greek, to total silence from the other customers. Then to add insult to injury, the master conveyed the requirements to the shopkeeper in fluent Welsh.\" \u0095 The other day I went to some big launch, backed by the prime minister, to persuade young persons to become entrepreneurs. There in the audience, smiling happily, was our own most famous entrepreneur, Sir Richard Branson. That very day the Guardian carried a report that Branson had been forced to apologise for sending threatening lawyers' letters to Australian firms called Virgin, which had had the temerity to wish to carry on trading under their old names even after Sir Richard had launched his internal airline, Virgin Blue. Outrageous behaviour! I gather the Catholic Church still talks about the Virgin Mary: stiff missive on its way from Sir Richard there. Meanwhile, Roger Virgin phones from Wales. He is a carpenter who has been trading as Virgin Building Services for 20 years. Such impudence was naturally rewarded by another bullying letter. Sir Richard assured me that the matter had been settled, but Roger Virgin is angry because so far he hasn't received any apology, either for the ludicrous letter, or for their derogatory implication that his building firm was on a level with Virgin services, eg their trains. Next month he is off on a bike ride from St Malo to Nantes, in aid of the NSPCC. It would be appropriate if Sir Richard sponsored him very generously. If he does I shall be happy to record the fact. \u0095 Congratulations to the BBC for declining to show live the Queen Mother's birthday celebrations. It's largely a corporate stunt, and if anyone cares they can watch it on ITV. (Did you know that, although the BBC wiped almost all the tapes of the sensationally funny Dud 'n' Pete show, Not Only But Also, they have every single Trooping Of The Colour preserved - a treasured memento of what?) But the royals have largely lost the plot. In early 1995 I ran a story in the Observer saying that Prince Charles did not actually want to inherit the throne; the thought filled him with depression. Naturally the palace angrily denied this. But then, reading the memoirs of Lord Goodman's confidante David Selbourne this week, I saw that the lawyer reported in 1992: \"He doesn't appear to want to be king, as far as I could gather.\" Like New Labour, our monarchy seems to have lost the vital distinction between the truth and what they want to see in the papers.",

Buoyed by recent opinion polls suggesting the gap between the Tories and Labour has closed to just seven points, Tory strategists are for the first time since the last general election daring to put a figure on the scale of potential gains. Mr Hague yesterday said he expected to see MPs from his party returned to office in Scotland because of the Tories' stance over the scrapping of the pound. Launching the Scottish leg of his party's UK-wide keep the pound campaign in Edinburgh, he claimed economic and monetary union might transfer more power to Brussels and Frankfurt than devolution had given to Edinburgh. Suggesting that keeping the pound was \"the settled will\" of the Scottish people, he said: \"Only the Scottish Conservatives will offer the people of Scotland what most of them want on this issue at the next election - and we confidently expect this will be one of the policies that will see Scottish Conservative MPs returned when that day comes.\" One party source said: \"At the 1992 election, the Tories went up, against most expectations, from 10 to 11 seats in Scotland, before losing them in 1997.

However, they may find that a tricky card to play, since they have accepted devolution in Scotland and Wales. There may also be flaws in Mr Hague's argument that Scots will also welcome the Conservatives' newly toughened stance on law and order and asylum. While Scotish Tories have clawed back a measure of political credibility under the leadership of David McLetchie and the stewardship of Sir Malcolm Rifkind, they have done so under a voter-friendly, moderate banner. Earlier this month, Sir Malcolm publicly urged Mr Hague to follow the example of the Scottish Tories and adopt a more \"moderate rhetoric\".

      "bodyText": "It was not a day for the faint hearted yesterday as the blue chip index suffered its second biggest fall of the year and the Techmark slumped to its lowest level this year. The 3% fall in the FTSE 100 to 6045, which wiped \u00a341bn off the value of the stock market, looked minor in comparison with the 9% slide in the Techmark, which ended a brutal day at 3,083, a level last visited on December 1. The day after the high-profile internet shopping firm Boo.com called in the receivers, dealers said that a profits warning from IT group Parity did little to boost sentiment. The group lost almost a quarter of its stock market value to end 47p lower at 162p, but above its worst level of 140p. Other technology stocks felt the pain, including Baltimore,which fell 70p to 419p, ARM Holdings, down 70.5p to 615.5p, and Logica, which ended at \u00a314.06, down 249p. Anxiety fed through to the telecoms sector, where British Telecom lost 41p to 881p and Cable &amp; Wireless fell 46p to 987p. It was an an unfortunate day for Marconi to issue its maiden set of results as a telecoms supplier, its shares sliding 111.5p to 765.5p. Media groups were not unscathed. Daily Mail &amp; General Trust slumped 64p to 882p while Pearson lost 239p to \u00a318.84. Most of the stocks that managed to cling on to gains were from the \"old economy\", including drinks group Diageo, up 17.5p to 546.75p, and rat-catcher Rentokil Initial, 4% higher at 140.25p, a 3.75p gain. Outside the FTSE 100, Scottish &amp; Newcastle was 6% higher at 549.5p, while Provident Financial led the FTSE 250 index with a rise of 53p to 703p after being tipped by a broker. Among the smaller stocks, one the biggest climbers was Country Gardens, the garden centre group, which admitted it had received a takeover approach from its rivals Wyevale Garden Centres. As a result Country Gardens, which said it was considered the offer along with other options, was 24% up at 256.5p. Predator Wyevale was little moved at 490p, down 0.5p. It was a sorry day for Glenchewton, a household goods distributor, after an attempted reverse takeover failed. Returning to the market for the first time since March 9, the shares immediately halved in value to 65.5p.",

The boxing promoter, Frank Warren, claimed more than 15,000 people had applied for tickets for the bout with Lou Savarese before yesterday's confirmation that it would take place at Hampden Park on June 24. The Scottish Football Association, defending its decision to allow the use of the national stadium, said the fight would be a showpiece event for Glasgow - a view echoed by one of the city's leading hoteliers. \"For three or four days next month the whole world will be talking about Mike Tyson in Glasgow and watching film from Glasgow,\" said Klaus Zsilla, general manager of the Hilton hotel, which has a provisional booking for the Tyson entourage. \"It is advertising for the city you could not pay for.\" Elsewhere, efforts were continuing to try to reverse the decision by the home secretary, Jack Straw, to let the boxer, a convicted rapist, into the UK for the second time.

He said Tyson was \"delighted\" to have been given the opportunity to return to fight in front of what will be the largest live audience of his career. \"People are entitled to their opinions about Mike, after all we live in a democratic society. \"I don't intend to be his apologist, but there are a lot of people who want to see him fight.\"",

The need for immediate action has been pressed at both the public inquiries covering the crashes, and the HSE is looking for swift action by the train operating companies. It has given the train and station operators until July 24 to reply to its proposals, with the intention of introducing new regulations within a year. For the first time, companies will be charged for inspections to defray a substantial increase in costs for policing the new inspection regime. In a terse introduction to the proposed regulations, the executive says the \"industry could and should do better\" on safety and that operators will have a new duty to make sure this is done. It says suitable instructions to passengers on how to escape and to use escape equipment must be made available and there must be sufficient signs to identify emergency equipment. At the inquiry into the Paddington crash, when 31 people died and more than 400 were injured, several passengers have commented on the absence of instructions on opening doors in an emergency, but the train operating companies say there are well displayed notices above doors explaining how catches can be released. The HSE has also suggested that data recorders should be fitted on all trains and drivers' conversations should be noted. The association of train operating companies, which represents Virgin, Stagecoach, National Express and others, pointed out that data recorders were installed on trains less than 12-years-old.

Formal charges against the three men alleged to have been responsible for some of the worst massacres of the war were made this month, shortly after the Nobel peace laureate Rigoberta Menchu lodged accusations in Spain against the former dictator and current speaker of the assembly Efrain Rios Montt and six other political or military leaders. Next month the trial is due to begin of five people accused of complicity in the murder in 1998 of the Roman Catholic bishop Juan Gerardi, two days after he presented the church's report on the atrocities, entitled Never Again.

      "bodyText": "A pipeline which will allow the oil reserves of Chad to be exploited by a consortium of oil companies is due to be approved by World Bank directors next week despite the fact that its own confidential report says the plan has a 50% risk of failure. Fears about security, corruption and human rights abuses in Cameroon and Chad, as well as concern that poverty alleviation - the main purpose of funding the pipeline - will not be realised, have been played down in the report to the bank's directors. The decision by two of the original consortium members, Shell and Elf, to pull out of the project after it was widely criticised by environmental and human rights groups has also been glossed over in the bank's project appraisal. Clare Short, secretary of state for overseas development and a World Bank governor, is to decide this weekend whether to back the loans for Chad and Cameroon to fund the building of the pipeline. Environmentalists want her to reject the plan but her department said on Thursday that she had not yet read the report. In a copy of the document passed to The Guardian, it is clear that the main beneficiaries of the bank funding for the 600-mile pipeline from Chad's oil fields to Cameroon's coast will be Exxon, the oil company leading the consortium, and the two new members - Chevron and Petronas. A conservative estimate of the net revenue for the 28 years the pipeline is expected to be in operation is more than \u00a36bn, less than a quarter of which will go to the two African countries. The annual \u00a340m revenue for Chad will double the government's income and total almost \u00a31.2bn. Cameroon will get \u00a312m a year. The bank report says Chad is 164th out of 174 nations in poverty indicators. Oil was found 25 years ago but has not been exploited because of past unrest, an inhospitable investment climate, unfavourable geography, and a dearth of trained staff. Because of these problems only the bank's support of \u00a3350m in loans to the two countries will provide the confidence for the commercial banking sector to stump up the \u00a32bn investment needed for the venture. The bank's own report says there is a \"significant\" risk that the project will not reach its objectives - including poverty alleviation. In the bank's jargon, significant risk is classed as a 50% chance of objectives not being reached. A deterioration in the security situation in Chad, absence of commitment to environmental protection in Chad and Cameroon, and human rights failures are all classed as significant risks.

      "body": "<p>At Clapham Manor primary school in south London on Thursday, 24 children, all 10 or 11 years old, sit in silence completing, along with an estimated 599,976 children in classrooms around the country, a key stage 2 English writing test.</p> <p>Some fidget, some look around the room, but most work diligently. They have to deliver one piece of writing from four choices.</p> <p>Their teacher, Liz Dougan, has read through the paper with them. They have had 15 minutes to plan and 45 minutes to write. They are in their normal classroom, but some parts of their walls have had to be covered - aides-to-learning like \"explanation\" words.</p> <p>When the exam finishes there is no heavy sighing, no hint of tears. They just sit while their teacher gathers their papers, and wait for the next thing, which happens to be the Guardian asking them how it went. Four thought it was hard. Fourteen thought it was easy. Twelve were nervous before. Sixteen enjoyed it. Four thought their parents were worried about how they did.</p> <p>\"You don't have to look for things to do - it's just your imagination,\" said Ali.</p> <p>\"We have done so many practice tests before this,\" said Rachel.</p> <p>Penny said she was worried. \"I don't think I'm really that good at writing.\"</p> <p>Ivan, Ishika, Ali and Ajjaz said they did homework for this week's SAT tests, 20 minutes a day for four or five weeks.</p> <p>Why had they done the test? \"It helps you get to a good secondary school and when you get into a good secondary school it helps you get a good job or get into college,\" said Penny, though in fact her results will come out too late to affect which school she gets into - though they might affect which stream she is put in.</p> <p>\"I think we did the exam to see the level the school was. It's for us to help the teachers,\" said Ajjaz.</p> <p>These children don't seem the stuff of the lurid stories painted in advance of the SAT tests, when parents took to the airwaves to complain of the stress they and their offspring were under, and union delegates warned of child suicides because of exam stress, as in Japan.</p> <p>\"What drivel!\" replied Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools, but the education secretary, David Blunkett, offered to \"very seriously consider\" dropping for seven-year-olds if it could be shown that children were under pressure. BBC Radio 4's Today programme sent him emails from parents and teachers, but nothing to change his mind. Nothing over the past fortnight - when 11-year-olds have been completing key stage 2 tests - or through May, when the sevens have been going through key stage 1 - has moved him either. The qualifications and curriculum authority says there have been no major problems.</p> <p>But there have been worrying anecdotes. In Queniborough primary, in Leicestershire, a parent told the headteacher, Chris Davis, spokesman for the National Primary Heads Association, how her daughter, 11, had been making excuses all weekend as to why she couldn't do the tests; on Friday and Saturday it was a headache, on Sunday she was physically sick several times.</p> <p><b> Cramming</b><br> There is no doubt, too, that schools are taking the tests increasingly seriously - although few have copied a school in Leicester, Taylor Road primary, which had pupils in school last Sunday to cram for the key stage 2 tests and spent four mornings of the Easter holidays holding revision classes.</p> <p>Ministers have closed a loophole which allowed teachers to see the tests two weeks in advance. But one parent in Westminster this week told the Guardian how his son, 10, had said his class had been divided into four groups for the tests - \"to make it easier for the teachers to explain the questions to us,\" came the reply.</p> <p>Worries about over-professionalisation have come to the fore, with concerns that the tests are being used for reasons other than the benefit of the child. And there are fears that children are simply being tested too much.</p> <p>As educationalists make a renewed push to emphasise play, as \"hyperparenting\" goes out of fashion in the US, and there are cheers for the success which Summerhill, the liberal private school in Suffolk, had in fending off inspection criticisms, schools are going in the other direction. Critics believe they are guided by a government which, from the education secretary to the chancellor, is preoccupied with toil. Testing is still on the increase - for high-fliers, for low-achievers, and to measure the \"dip\" in performance in the first year of secondary school. A clever child could soon have only one year, aged six, completely free of nationally recognised summer exams.</p> <p>Schools are already conscious of the impact of published test results at 11 and 16, which affect their place in the school league tables. Enthusiastic heads such as Brian Hazell at Clapham Manor, who believes in testing, and is enormously proud of his achievements, dislike the way some parents compare results without taking into account the intake and background of the pupils.</p> <p>But it emerged this week that sales of optional QCA tests for eights, nines, and 10s in English and maths have soared, with 20,000 primary schools - 5,000 more than last year - buying them. That means an estimated 560,000 children - about 90% of the age group nationwide - are sitting them. Union leaders believe the cause is the government's introduction of performance-related pay for teachers. To win the extra \u00a32,000, teachers must demonstrate that their pupils are achieving more \"relative to their prior attainment\". What better way than government-backed tests?</p> <p>Most schools test at eight, nine and 10 anyway, to establish progress. Some union officials believe - although it is not proven - that sales of tests from other organisations will have fallen away. But the link to pay seems likely to put more pressure, through the teachers, on the parents.</p> <p>Alan Smithers, professor of education at Liverpool University. said: \"We were under-testing, in that we only had an exam at the end of compulsory education and really no national testing in between, so we didn't know what was happening. But since tests were introduced at seven, 11 and 14, things have moved on.</p> <p>\"We decided that as the tests we put in were probably benefiting the education system we have just started adding more and more and now it looks as though the whole concept has gone away from tests as an indicator of student progress to becoming the main purpose of education.</p> <p>\"We are testing now to find out how our children are doing, secondly to find out how the schools are doing, and thirdly to find out how the teachers are doing.</p> <p><b> Frenzy</b> <br>\"We are going away from diagnostic testing with national testing at the end of compulsory education, so children are being tested virtually all the time. We have got into a testing frenzy at the moment.\" He notes also pressure to reach the government's targets at age 11 - with 80% of children expected to reach the required literacy standard and 75% the numeracy standard by 2002.</p> <p>Prof Smithers believes that testing is necessary is 11, 16 and 18. But beyond basic literacy and numeracy, he asks, \"to what extent do you capture the purpose of education in a test?</p> <p>\"Education is really about the basic ways of making sense of life in preparation for an uncertain future. You don't develop that individual sense of responsibility for your life if you are constantly being tested.\"</p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, says: \"There is a danger that you lose the richness of education that comes from the breadth of the curriculum. The excitement of learning for young people is about history and geography and technology and all the other subjects as well as English, maths and science.\"</p> <p>To Prof Smithers, with more testing comes less time for creativity, for crucial but more nebulous learning; he notes the government's rush to crowbar topics like citizenship into the curriculum because they are no longer being covered, more organically, in subjects like history. \"We need to see what is essential and then actually start reducing the requirements on that basis.\"</p> <p>SATs, says Margaret Morrissey, of the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations, have \"really become a quite magnificent obsession\".</p> <p>\"Everywhere a parent walks there is a book or a learning aide that they can use and purchase with their child. It's very difficult now to find a game that you can purchase to use with your child.\"</p> <p>But at schools like Clapham Manor, the exams have gone well. The teachers have prepared, but they prepare for every lesson. The school, praised to the hilt by Ofsted this year, is hopeful. And for their 11-year-olds, SATs are not even the biggest stress they face academically.</p> <p>\"The SATs come too late for the secondary schools to judge children,\" says Mr Hazell. \"The secondary schools are doing their own tests and they are doing them at the end of the year. Some children have to go to seven or eight secondary schools for tests.\"</p> <p><b>Testing, testing ... the exam regime children face - Britain</b></p> <p>Age <br><b> Four to five</b> (start of year one): Baseline assessment.

      "bodyText": "At Clapham Manor primary school in south London on Thursday, 24 children, all 10 or 11 years old, sit in silence completing, along with an estimated 599,976 children in classrooms around the country, a key stage 2 English writing test. Some fidget, some look around the room, but most work diligently. They have to deliver one piece of writing from four choices. Their teacher, Liz Dougan, has read through the paper with them. They have had 15 minutes to plan and 45 minutes to write. They are in their normal classroom, but some parts of their walls have had to be covered - aides-to-learning like \"explanation\" words. When the exam finishes there is no heavy sighing, no hint of tears. They just sit while their teacher gathers their papers, and wait for the next thing, which happens to be the Guardian asking them how it went. Four thought it was hard. Fourteen thought it was easy. Twelve were nervous before. Sixteen enjoyed it. Four thought their parents were worried about how they did. \"You don't have to look for things to do - it's just your imagination,\" said Ali. \"We have done so many practice tests before this,\" said Rachel. Penny said she was worried. \"I don't think I'm really that good at writing.\" Ivan, Ishika, Ali and Ajjaz said they did homework for this week's SAT tests, 20 minutes a day for four or five weeks. Why had they done the test? \"It helps you get to a good secondary school and when you get into a good secondary school it helps you get a good job or get into college,\" said Penny, though in fact her results will come out too late to affect which school she gets into - though they might affect which stream she is put in. \"I think we did the exam to see the level the school was. It's for us to help the teachers,\" said Ajjaz. These children don't seem the stuff of the lurid stories painted in advance of the SAT tests, when parents took to the airwaves to complain of the stress they and their offspring were under, and union delegates warned of child suicides because of exam stress, as in Japan. \"What drivel!\" replied Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools, but the education secretary, David Blunkett, offered to \"very seriously consider\" dropping for seven-year-olds if it could be shown that children were under pressure. BBC Radio 4's Today programme sent him emails from parents and teachers, but nothing to change his mind. Nothing over the past fortnight - when 11-year-olds have been completing key stage 2 tests - or through May, when the sevens have been going through key stage 1 - has moved him either. The qualifications and curriculum authority says there have been no major problems. But there have been worrying anecdotes. In Queniborough primary, in Leicestershire, a parent told the headteacher, Chris Davis, spokesman for the National Primary Heads Association, how her daughter, 11, had been making excuses all weekend as to why she couldn't do the tests; on Friday and Saturday it was a headache, on Sunday she was physically sick several times. Cramming There is no doubt, too, that schools are taking the tests increasingly seriously - although few have copied a school in Leicester, Taylor Road primary, which had pupils in school last Sunday to cram for the key stage 2 tests and spent four mornings of the Easter holidays holding revision classes. Ministers have closed a loophole which allowed teachers to see the tests two weeks in advance. But one parent in Westminster this week told the Guardian how his son, 10, had said his class had been divided into four groups for the tests - \"to make it easier for the teachers to explain the questions to us,\" came the reply. Worries about over-professionalisation have come to the fore, with concerns that the tests are being used for reasons other than the benefit of the child. And there are fears that children are simply being tested too much. As educationalists make a renewed push to emphasise play, as \"hyperparenting\" goes out of fashion in the US, and there are cheers for the success which Summerhill, the liberal private school in Suffolk, had in fending off inspection criticisms, schools are going in the other direction. Critics believe they are guided by a government which, from the education secretary to the chancellor, is preoccupied with toil. Testing is still on the increase - for high-fliers, for low-achievers, and to measure the \"dip\" in performance in the first year of secondary school. A clever child could soon have only one year, aged six, completely free of nationally recognised summer exams. Schools are already conscious of the impact of published test results at 11 and 16, which affect their place in the school league tables. Enthusiastic heads such as Brian Hazell at Clapham Manor, who believes in testing, and is enormously proud of his achievements, dislike the way some parents compare results without taking into account the intake and background of the pupils. But it emerged this week that sales of optional QCA tests for eights, nines, and 10s in English and maths have soared, with 20,000 primary schools - 5,000 more than last year - buying them. That means an estimated 560,000 children - about 90% of the age group nationwide - are sitting them. Union leaders believe the cause is the government's introduction of performance-related pay for teachers. To win the extra \u00a32,000, teachers must demonstrate that their pupils are achieving more \"relative to their prior attainment\". What better way than government-backed tests? Most schools test at eight, nine and 10 anyway, to establish progress. Some union officials believe - although it is not proven - that sales of tests from other organisations will have fallen away. But the link to pay seems likely to put more pressure, through the teachers, on the parents. Alan Smithers, professor of education at Liverpool University. said: \"We were under-testing, in that we only had an exam at the end of compulsory education and really no national testing in between, so we didn't know what was happening. But since tests were introduced at seven, 11 and 14, things have moved on. \"We decided that as the tests we put in were probably benefiting the education system we have just started adding more and more and now it looks as though the whole concept has gone away from tests as an indicator of student progress to becoming the main purpose of education. \"We are testing now to find out how our children are doing, secondly to find out how the schools are doing, and thirdly to find out how the teachers are doing. Frenzy \"We are going away from diagnostic testing with national testing at the end of compulsory education, so children are being tested virtually all the time. We have got into a testing frenzy at the moment.\" He notes also pressure to reach the government's targets at age 11 - with 80% of children expected to reach the required literacy standard and 75% the numeracy standard by 2002. Prof Smithers believes that testing is necessary is 11, 16 and 18. But beyond basic literacy and numeracy, he asks, \"to what extent do you capture the purpose of education in a test? \"Education is really about the basic ways of making sense of life in preparation for an uncertain future. You don't develop that individual sense of responsibility for your life if you are constantly being tested.\" John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, says: \"There is a danger that you lose the richness of education that comes from the breadth of the curriculum. The excitement of learning for young people is about history and geography and technology and all the other subjects as well as English, maths and science.\" To Prof Smithers, with more testing comes less time for creativity, for crucial but more nebulous learning; he notes the government's rush to crowbar topics like citizenship into the curriculum because they are no longer being covered, more organically, in subjects like history. \"We need to see what is essential and then actually start reducing the requirements on that basis.\" SATs, says Margaret Morrissey, of the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations, have \"really become a quite magnificent obsession\". \"Everywhere a parent walks there is a book or a learning aide that they can use and purchase with their child. It's very difficult now to find a game that you can purchase to use with your child.\" But at schools like Clapham Manor, the exams have gone well. The teachers have prepared, but they prepare for every lesson. The school, praised to the hilt by Ofsted this year, is hopeful. And for their 11-year-olds, SATs are not even the biggest stress they face academically. \"The SATs come too late for the secondary schools to judge children,\" says Mr Hazell. \"The secondary schools are doing their own tests and they are doing them at the end of the year. Some children have to go to seven or eight secondary schools for tests.\" Testing, testing ... the exam regime children face - Britain Age Four to five (start of year one): Baseline assessment. Must be assessed within 7 weeks of starting primary school, covering basic speaking and listening, reading, writing, mathematics and personal and social development. Six : No tests.

The firm, Underhill Training Ltd, has agreed to repay thousands of pounds to a further education college after it submitted false claims for government funding to train dozens of students in their National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) at fees of up to \u00a31,900 each. A team of auditors from another client, Thames Valley Enterprise, was sent into Underhill's offices on Thursday to seize documents relating to the 104 trainees after it was alleged that at least four claims - involving serving soldiers based at Chelsea barracks - were fraudulent. The Department for Education and Employment has now launched a full investigation. The trainees, who include BT Cellnet engineers, had no knowledge of the fraudulent qualifications awarded in their names. Underhill, which sub-contracts from government-funded training and enterprise councils (TECs) to provide on-the-job-training for young people aged 18 to 25, faces allegations that staff falsified attendance records, forged the signatures of assessors, employers and students on time sheets and assessments, and made funding claims for people who never finished their courses and others who never even enrolled. Occupationally-based training has become one of Britain's biggest growth industries, with the \"edu-business\" estimated to be worth more than \u00a31.3bn a year. But the government was forced to set up a special unit dedicated to fighting fraud involving TEC funds in 1996 following a National Audit Office report into allegations of bogus claims. The latest allegations suggest, however, that companies may still be able to abuse administrative loopholes within the TEC funding system. Underhill, based in Slough, has training contracts with two TECs, Thames Valley Enterprise and Focus in central London, as well as franchise deals with Bracknell and Wokingham College and Uxbridge College. The company, which is expected to have a turnover of \u00a31.2m this year, also provides training for employees at BT Cellnet, Parcelforce, Marconi Communications and Wickes, the DIY superstores. Sources within the company claim that many more of the 400 certificates awarded by Underhill in the past year may have been \"unsafe\", a claim which if proved true would involve hundreds of thousands of pounds. Bracknell and Wokingham College terminated its contract with Underhill last month after an internal audit revealed that the company had falsely claimed almost \u00a336,000 in fees for BT Cellnet employees studying for NVQs in telecommunications. Underhill has agreed to repay the fees claimed for the students, most of whom denied any knowledge of the NVQ courses when they were contacted by college staff. The college must now repay \u00a3111,000 in fees to the Further Education Funding Council plus a penalty which may run into tens of thousands of pounds. Minutes of a meeting on April 14 reveal the college's concern about Underhill. Other Underhill clients are also understood to be instigating audits of their contracts with the company, including Thames Valley Enterprise. Underhill staff claimed that most qualifications awarded by the firm were assessed internally, with external authorisation made only by post from the awarding body, the telecommunications vocational standards council, int-elect, in Milton Keynes. The board of directors at Underhill Training Ltd issued a statement yesterday saying they had co-operated fully with the audit team and made all records available. \"We are not aware of any significant issues of concern, and continue to operate to resolve this matter ... \"With reference to Bracknell College, this matter was discussed and resolved last month and is now considered closed.\"",

      "body": "<b> You should feel the ride quality in its bendy buses?</b> <p>Yes, its articulated super buses operate in Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. It is the leading UK-based international passenger transport group, employing more than 28,000 people. It has an annual turnover nudging \u00a32bn with a fleet of more than 8,000 buses and more than 22% market share. It also controls rail franchises operating the Great Eastern Railway, Great Western Trains and North Western Trains. </p> <p><b> Is there a lot of brass in buses?</b> </p> <p>This week, after posting pre-tax profits of \u00a3121.5m, up 28% on turnover of \u00a31.8bn, stockbrokers were asking 196p a share,valuing the firm at \u00a3849.6m. </p> <p><b> When was it formed?</b> </p> <p>Until 1985 it was part of the state-owned National Bus Company, operating as Badgerline with a few dozen buses in and around the Weston- super-Mare area. The business was successful enough, but on its own it was never likely to satisfy its ambitious management, headed by managing director Trevor Smallwood. </p> <p>Then the government passed legislation allowing the National Bus Company to be privatised. The management at Badgerline realised they had a once-in-a-lifetime chance to own their company and make serious money. They moved fast and by September 1986 they had bought Badgerline with the help of loans from Hill Samuel and NatWest. With the flotation came yet more expansion, swallowing Stoke-on-Trent bus company PMT in 1994 for \u00a323m, adding another 500 buses to its fleet and another 1,400 staff to the payroll. </p> <p>But the merger with its Scottish rival GRT a year later spelled the end of the Badgerline name when the merged group became FirstBus. The same year, with rail privatisation a reality, it won the franchise to run the Great Eastern route, serving parts of Essex and Suffolk.

      "bodyText": "You should feel the ride quality in its bendy buses? Yes, its articulated super buses operate in Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. It is the leading UK-based international passenger transport group, employing more than 28,000 people. It has an annual turnover nudging \u00a32bn with a fleet of more than 8,000 buses and more than 22% market share. It also controls rail franchises operating the Great Eastern Railway, Great Western Trains and North Western Trains. Is there a lot of brass in buses? This week, after posting pre-tax profits of \u00a3121.5m, up 28% on turnover of \u00a31.8bn, stockbrokers were asking 196p a share,valuing the firm at \u00a3849.6m. When was it formed? Until 1985 it was part of the state-owned National Bus Company, operating as Badgerline with a few dozen buses in and around the Weston- super-Mare area. The business was successful enough, but on its own it was never likely to satisfy its ambitious management, headed by managing director Trevor Smallwood. Then the government passed legislation allowing the National Bus Company to be privatised. The management at Badgerline realised they had a once-in-a-lifetime chance to own their company and make serious money. They moved fast and by September 1986 they had bought Badgerline with the help of loans from Hill Samuel and NatWest. With the flotation came yet more expansion, swallowing Stoke-on-Trent bus company PMT in 1994 for \u00a323m, adding another 500 buses to its fleet and another 1,400 staff to the payroll. But the merger with its Scottish rival GRT a year later spelled the end of the Badgerline name when the merged group became FirstBus. The same year, with rail privatisation a reality, it won the franchise to run the Great Eastern route, serving parts of Essex and Suffolk. It also took a stake in Great Western Holdings, operator of services in the north west and from Bristol to London. Another name change was needed as FirstBus was now more than a bus company; enter FirstGroup. And since then it has added a controlling stake in Bristol International Airport. Any tips to charm its recruiting officers? You must mention its introduction of new articulated super buses which are 18 metres long with two sections and already operate in several large cities. It is a major backer of the government's new proposals for the bus industry contained in the White Paper on transport to create an integrated national transport network. And show awareness of its contract to design, build and run the \u00a350m City of Edinburgh Rapid Transit (CERT) bus route between the airport and the city centre. The nine-kilometre busway is expected to be operational by 2001. Applaud last year's successful opening of its Croydon Tramlink and heap praises on its decision to form a consortium that will put up 60% of the cost of building a tram service to ease Bristol's congestion problems. What are the chances of a foreign posting? It has just recently spent \u00a3603m to buy Ryder Public Transportation Services (RPTS), the second biggest US operator of school buses, with more than 10,200 school buses in 25 states. Do equal opportunities get a front seat? It is one of those rare British companies that invites an employee director chosen by a staff referendum to sit on its main board; current employee director is Jean Weatherhead. Thanks to ThinkFirst, its survey of staff attitudes and expectations, it has come up with a new training and development programme reflecting employee views to spread best people-managemant practice across its operations. Any clues on workers' wages? Average salaries work out around \u00a317,000, boosted by an employee share ownership plan that distributes 5% of pre-tax profits among 29,000 eligible employees. Busloads of cash for the bosses, no doubt? That's such a last century sentiment; haven't you heard that in the real world bosses are paid according to their market value?

      "bodyText": "One of the joint owners of the Dutch fireworks warehouse which exploded last weekend, killing 20 people and wounding almost 1,000, has turned himself in to the police and been arrested. Wilhelm Pater walked into a police station late yesterday afternoon, the regional prosecutor in Almelo, Nienke Zwart, said last night. An estimated 100 tonnes of fireworks stored on the premises ignited during a fire, causing a deadly blast which devastated an entire district of the city last Saturday afternoon. The justice ministry issued national and international arrest warrants after a search of the men's homes and offices on Thursday, on suspicion of breaking the storage conditions set out in their environmental permit. Enschende city officials said earlier in the week that the two had contacted them through their lawyer and promised to cooperate with the official investigation into the explosion. Mr Bakker's whereabouts remains a mystery, although a Dutch newspaper reported that he had spent two days in hospital at Gronau, just across the German border. Film screened in the Netherlands this week showed Mr Bakker in the crowd fleeing as the explosion occurred. City officials said immediately after the blast that the warehouse was fully licensed and had passed routine safety checks just three days earlier. But it was quickly questioned whether the inspectors were equipped to monitor the strength of the explosives, and not just the number of boxes stored in the concrete bunkers. In January 1997, it has emerged, the company was given a permit to expand its storage area. But there were later complaints that the metal containers used for the explosives were placed dangerously close to one another. An expert was quoted yesterday as describing the storage conditions as \"incredible.\" In a related development, the Vrij Nederland newspaper reported that a Dutch army officer had been suspended because of a conflict of interest in working as a freelance consultant to firework companies which his job required him to supervise. Many townspeople complained that they had not known of the warehouse's existence, and asked why it was allowed to be in the heart of a residential area. Figures issued by the city last night showed that the number of people still unaccounted for had dropped to 10. Initially the police were overwhelmed with reports of 4,400 missing, and called in reinforcements to help track them down and quell fears that many more lives were lost. Of the 964 people injured, 28 were still in hospital yesterday, six of them in intensive care . Last night the prime minster, Wim Kok, was due to join Crown Prince Willem Alexander at the head of a silent procession in memory of the 20 victims. Earlier, firefighters paid their last respects to two colleagues who died fighting what started as a routine blaze. Two more are to be buried today. \"Four of us did not return,\" read a condolence message in the national daily de Volkskrant. \"We are stirred, immensely saddened and barely realise what has happened.\" The four died when the storage bunkers containing the explosives went up in an enormous blast which damaged 400 houses and flattened the heart of the Roombeek district.",

Actively managed funds tend to cost more to run than trackers. The aim of active managers is to produce above-average performance by choosing shares that will outshine the general trend.

Using a computer to run the tracker fund, this is programmed to trade shares in line with the movement on the market. The value of the tracker fund will move in direct proportion to that of the FTSE-100 itself.</p> <p>By choosing an index tracker private investors avoid the risk of ending up with a poor performing fund although, in return, they give up the chance of finding one of the better performers.</p> <p>But there is concern that trackers have reached the end of their rails. Vodafone Airtouch is now worth around 14% of the FTSE-100 - unit trusts are supposed to put no more than 10% of their total funds in any one investment.</p> <p>Ian Millward, of the independent financial adviser Chase de Vere Investments, thinks it is not a good time to invest in tracker funds because of this. He says: \"Don't invest in a FTSE-100 tracker. If you're in one, move to an FT All-Share tracker because there are more shares and you can spread the risks.\"</p> <p>Of the funds that track the FT All-Share, he recommends M&amp;G Index Tracker with no initial fee and 0.3% annual management charge for investors looking for long-term growth.</p> <p>For a FTSE-100 tracker, Ben Yearsley, of IFA Hargreaves Lansdown, would go for Liontrust Top 100, the cheapest tracker on the market with no initial fee and a 0.295% annual management charge.</p> <p>HSBC Asset Management conducts quarterly research of active managers versus their benchmark index, examining whether active funds are adding value against an index.</p> <p>The research shows the global strength of technology, media and telecoms stocks helped active managers to beat indices over the past 12 months.</p> <p>The latest fund to track the FTSE-100 is from a new company called iShares, based in Dublin. The company's first fund, the iFTSE 100, is a new type of investment - a hybrid of an investment trust and a unit trust and is managed by Barclays Global Investors.</p> <p>iShares works as an exchange traded fund, in other words a fund with shares quoted on the stock market. Like investment trusts, this fund will trade on the London stock exchange.</p> <p>But, unlike tracker funds offered by unit trusts and open-ended investment companies (Oeics) which change the price once a day, iShare's price will vary throughout the day like an investment trust. And in line with the most competitive trackers, the annual management charge is 0.35%.</p> <p>So, if you're investing in a tracker fund pick the right index first, then choose the cheapest trust. But don't expect miracles - when stock markets fall, your fund will track down along with it, and there's nothing you can do about it.</p>",

By choosing an index tracker private investors avoid the risk of ending up with a poor performing fund although, in return, they give up the chance of finding one of the better performers. But there is concern that trackers have reached the end of their rails. Vodafone Airtouch is now worth around 14% of the FTSE-100 - unit trusts are supposed to put no more than 10% of their total funds in any one investment. Ian Millward, of the independent financial adviser Chase de Vere Investments, thinks it is not a good time to invest in tracker funds because of this. He says: \"Don't invest in a FTSE-100 tracker. If you're in one, move to an FT All-Share tracker because there are more shares and you can spread the risks.\" Of the funds that track the FT All-Share, he recommends M&amp;G Index Tracker with no initial fee and 0.3% annual management charge for investors looking for long-term growth. For a FTSE-100 tracker, Ben Yearsley, of IFA Hargreaves Lansdown, would go for Liontrust Top 100, the cheapest tracker on the market with no initial fee and a 0.295% annual management charge. HSBC Asset Management conducts quarterly research of active managers versus their benchmark index, examining whether active funds are adding value against an index. The research shows the global strength of technology, media and telecoms stocks helped active managers to beat indices over the past 12 months. The latest fund to track the FTSE-100 is from a new company called iShares, based in Dublin. The company's first fund, the iFTSE 100, is a new type of investment - a hybrid of an investment trust and a unit trust and is managed by Barclays Global Investors. iShares works as an exchange traded fund, in other words a fund with shares quoted on the stock market. Like investment trusts, this fund will trade on the London stock exchange. But, unlike tracker funds offered by unit trusts and open-ended investment companies (Oeics) which change the price once a day, iShare's price will vary throughout the day like an investment trust. And in line with the most competitive trackers, the annual management charge is 0.35%. So, if you're investing in a tracker fund pick the right index first, then choose the cheapest trust. But don't expect miracles - when stock markets fall, your fund will track down along with it, and there's nothing you can do about it.",

But a succession of government measures aimed at getting more of our savings into the stock market has changed all that. Today's savers have Peps, Isas, shares from demutualisations and a host of other investments that people in the 1960s would have considered more liberating than the contraceptive pill. And along with the choice of investment vehicle has come the choice of which market to invest in. Forty years ago most people paid their money to an insurance company for 25 years and received a nice lump sum at the end of it. Today investors have to weigh up the old economy against the new economy - on top of longer lasting concepts such as geographical and currency splits. But what is the old economy and does it stand to provide greater or lower capital growth than the new economy over the next decade? The old economy is defined by experts as the more traditional blue-chip companies that are seen as part of a country's history, such as Cadbury Schweppes, Barclays Bank and Unilever. New economy companies are those taking advantage of the latest sciences to grow or change their businesses and provide services with a heavy bias towards technological solutions. The performance monitoring company Standard &amp; Poor's includes internet, technology and telecoms stocks in its definition of new economy and says that over the past three years these sectors have returned more than 300% for investors. The old economy, which Standard and Poor's says is anything not in these sectors, has in turn gained only 45% over the same period. But the experts are split over whether this trend will continue and where people should be putting their money to achieve the greatest growth over the next 10 years.

Now, however, the investment trust sector has adopted a change of tactics in a bid to lose its dowdy Victorian image.</p> <p>Last year, the Association of Investment Trust Companies enlisted crooner Paolo Conte to entice investors to the world of investment trusts for its multi-million pound \"its\" advertising campaign.</p> <p>The \u00a32.1bn Witan investment trust sent glamorous \"hit squads\" into London's square mile to promote the trust for its own \u00a3350,000 advertising campaign.</p> <p>They are also moving on to the internet; today investment trust information is just the click of a mouse away. The Association of Investment Trust Companies has led the charge and its website offers a section on understanding investment trusts and how they work can for you.</p> <p>There is a trust finder that helps you to find an investment trust that suits your needs, and allows you to link through to the individual website. People can also download factsheets on aspects of investments.</p> <p>\"You can get information on investment trusts for children, for mortgages, for income or capital growth, for individual savings accounts, for split capital investment trusts or 'its' for pensions. You name it, you can get it,\" says the AITC's Annabel Brodie-Smith.</p> <p>The AITC is not alone in providing services for the internet-savvy investor. Most of the big-name companies including the likes of Fleming, Foreign &amp; Colonial, Dresdner RCM, Henderson and Witan have websites designed to woo and help potential investors. The sites give up-to-date performance data and share prices, while investors can download brochures, application forms and key features documents for their trust ranges.</p> <p>But some have taken the concept a step further. For example, visitors to the Edinburgh Fund Managers site can now select and apply for Isas online. The application takes about 20 minutes with a navigation panel showing where you are in the process.

      "bodyText": "Over most periods, investment trusts have beaten rival collective investments such as unit trusts and open-ended investment companies thanks to a combination of low charges and the ability to borrow so they can gear up when markets are booming. But they are little used by private investors and are seen as old-fashioned. Now, however, the investment trust sector has adopted a change of tactics in a bid to lose its dowdy Victorian image. Last year, the Association of Investment Trust Companies enlisted crooner Paolo Conte to entice investors to the world of investment trusts for its multi-million pound \"its\" advertising campaign. The \u00a32.1bn Witan investment trust sent glamorous \"hit squads\" into London's square mile to promote the trust for its own \u00a3350,000 advertising campaign. They are also moving on to the internet; today investment trust information is just the click of a mouse away. The Association of Investment Trust Companies has led the charge and its website offers a section on understanding investment trusts and how they work can for you. There is a trust finder that helps you to find an investment trust that suits your needs, and allows you to link through to the individual website. People can also download factsheets on aspects of investments. \"You can get information on investment trusts for children, for mortgages, for income or capital growth, for individual savings accounts, for split capital investment trusts or 'its' for pensions. You name it, you can get it,\" says the AITC's Annabel Brodie-Smith. The AITC is not alone in providing services for the internet-savvy investor. Most of the big-name companies including the likes of Fleming, Foreign &amp; Colonial, Dresdner RCM, Henderson and Witan have websites designed to woo and help potential investors. The sites give up-to-date performance data and share prices, while investors can download brochures, application forms and key features documents for their trust ranges. But some have taken the concept a step further. For example, visitors to the Edinburgh Fund Managers site can now select and apply for Isas online. The application takes about 20 minutes with a navigation panel showing where you are in the process. Once the application is complete investors are emailed to confirm that their investment is being processed. When it comes to funds that are embracing technology, investment trusts have as much to offer as their unit trust counterparts. The two names that frequently crop up are Finsbury Technology and Henderson Technology. And it is easy to see why.Despite falling by nearly a third from recent peaks, Finsbury Technology is still worth three times its value a year ago, while Henderson, down by a quarter from all-time highs, stands at four times its launch value. Indeed, the Henderson fund has come in for some criticism because its fund managers are set to get a slice of a \u00a340m performance fee for beating its \"inappropriate\" benchmark index by 200% last year. Henderson is entitled to 15% of the difference. Both trusts invest in small and medium sized companies across the globe, although US-based companies currently dominate their portfolios. But while there are small number of specialist technology trusts on the market some analysts believe the smaller UK investment trusts could offer an alternative for investors wanting exposure to technology. Many other trusts have significant weightings in technology stocks. They offer people a cheap way into technology because many can be bought on substantial discounts compared with the premiums of Henderson and Finsbury. Trusts such as Murray Enterprise and Henderson Smaller Companies have more than half of their portfolios invested in tech stocks, yet are trading at discounts of about 20%. But Merrill Lynch analyst Charles Cade warns investors that there can be drawbacks and believes investors should stick to a specialist technology fund if that is the sector they prefer. \"Several funds have concentrated portfolios with substantial stock-specific risk,\" he says. \"An advantage of a technology fund is you know what you are getting.

      "body": "<p>It may well be true that more and more people are buying books on the internet, but one thing the net has not done is affect the success of the book fair.</p> <p>There are book fairs all over the country all of time, in village halls, town halls, and hotels. But June is a special month for book fairs. This is when the Provincial Book Sellers Association (PBSA) holds its annual jamboree in the Hotel Russell in London's Bloomsbury and more fairs in adjacent hotels.</p> <p>June is also the month for the Antiquarian Book Fair, organised by the Antiquarian Booksellers Association which was founded in 1906. It seems to get bigger every year. The fair moved recently from Grosvenor House to Olympia ,where it is being held this year from June 8-11, to accommodate the greater numbers wanting to exhibit.</p> <p>One dealer explains the success of the book fair as follows: \"If you are buying a book because you want to read it, then the net is obviously a good way to proceed. Your local bookshop might not have what you want and these websites are quick and efficient.</p> <p>\"But if you are a serious collector or a general collector you need to see what you are buying. You need to confirm the book is what the catalogue says it is, that no pages are missing and such like. Condition is important to the value of a book and condition is something difficult to establish unless it is in your hands.\"</p> <p>For whatever reason, lots of books are sold at the fairs. The dealer continues: \"When you consider the average cost of a book at the PBSA fair is in the hundreds and they turn over \u00a31m in a few days, that means a lot of books. The average cost at the Antiquarian Book Fair is rather higher, but the Fair takes some \u00a31-2m in just four days.\"</p> <p>In the strictest definition an antiquarian book is anything published before 1820, when they introduced wood into the paper. Certainly there are some old and venerable books at the Fair. Anyone who collects travel literature would be interested in the great age of exploration, roughly from James Cook at the end of the 18th century to the likes of Richard Burton and David Livingston in the late 19th.</p> <p>Bernard J Shapero Rare Books, a leading London dealer specialising in travel, medicine and science books, has a complete set of James Cook's three circumnavigations of the globe from 1768 to 1779 before he was killed in Hawaii. These are priced at \u00a317,500.</p> <p>But the word antiquarian is something of a misnomer as far as the Fair is concerned. The dealers prefer the American description of old books as rare and used books, rather than antiquarian and second-hand. The Fair covers all periods and there is something for every pocket.</p> <p>And there are some contemporary books. Much has been made of the craze for modern first editions, which seems to have got completely out of hand. A complete set of three books of JR Rowling's Harry Potter books are on offer for \u00a315,000. Her first book, The Philosopher's Stone, sold for \u00a34.95 in hardback.</p> <p>In my never-ending quest to find the next big thing in alternative investments I shall certainly stop by Brian Lake's Jarndyce books stand. Although a specialist in Dickens, he has also carved out a little corner in what he calls bizarre books. He has made the definition easy by publishing an updated version with Russell Ash of his Bizarre Books (Pavilion Books, \u00a36.99, e-mail: ash@pavilion.co.uk), which contains 2,000 titles.</p> <p>He says that he knows these titles exist because he has them or has seen all of them. Ignoring the many smutty ones here are a few titles: Barbs, Prongs, Points, Prickers and Stickers: A Complete and Illustrated Catalogue of Antique Barbed Wire, and A Hundred and Forty Ways of Spelling Birmingham.</p> <p>The book is very amusing, but do these tomes amount to a collectible field? Brian Lake says: \"When I started this 20 years ago there were a number of collectors in California with big collections. Now it is growing here. Let me put it this way. I have a window display in my shop opposite the British Museum of 80 of these books. They are not for sale but I could sell them 20 times over. One book called Fish Who Answer The Telephone, which I thought was worth \u00a315, I sold to an Italian film director who insisted on paying \u00a350 for it.</p> <p>Brian Lake does not have the field all to himself. At the Fair will be Roger Treglown, a Cheshire dealer specialising in chess. He says Bizarre Books are very specialised but there is growing interest. He has on offer: The Resistance of Piles to Penetration, London 1950 - about civil engineering at \u00a3145 - and The Cement and Concrete Association: How Concrete Can Help the Pig Breeder, London 1950, at \u00a310.</p> <p>Modern Firsts were given a push when a book was published about them, so you never know.</p> <p>\u0095 Readers wanting to visit the Fair can obtain a free ticket for June 9 onwards by ringing the ABA office on 020-7439-3118.</p>",

One dealer explains the success of the book fair as follows: \"If you are buying a book because you want to read it, then the net is obviously a good way to proceed. Your local bookshop might not have what you want and these websites are quick and efficient. \"But if you are a serious collector or a general collector you need to see what you are buying. You need to confirm the book is what the catalogue says it is, that no pages are missing and such like. Condition is important to the value of a book and condition is something difficult to establish unless it is in your hands.\" For whatever reason, lots of books are sold at the fairs. The dealer continues: \"When you consider the average cost of a book at the PBSA fair is in the hundreds and they turn over \u00a31m in a few days, that means a lot of books. The average cost at the Antiquarian Book Fair is rather higher, but the Fair takes some \u00a31-2m in just four days.\" In the strictest definition an antiquarian book is anything published before 1820, when they introduced wood into the paper. Certainly there are some old and venerable books at the Fair. Anyone who collects travel literature would be interested in the great age of exploration, roughly from James Cook at the end of the 18th century to the likes of Richard Burton and David Livingston in the late 19th. Bernard J Shapero Rare Books, a leading London dealer specialising in travel, medicine and science books, has a complete set of James Cook's three circumnavigations of the globe from 1768 to 1779 before he was killed in Hawaii. These are priced at \u00a317,500. But the word antiquarian is something of a misnomer as far as the Fair is concerned. The dealers prefer the American description of old books as rare and used books, rather than antiquarian and second-hand. The Fair covers all periods and there is something for every pocket. And there are some contemporary books. Much has been made of the craze for modern first editions, which seems to have got completely out of hand. A complete set of three books of JR Rowling's Harry Potter books are on offer for \u00a315,000. Her first book, The Philosopher's Stone, sold for \u00a34.95 in hardback. In my never-ending quest to find the next big thing in alternative investments I shall certainly stop by Brian Lake's Jarndyce books stand. Although a specialist in Dickens, he has also carved out a little corner in what he calls bizarre books. He has made the definition easy by publishing an updated version with Russell Ash of his Bizarre Books (Pavilion Books, \u00a36.99, e-mail: ash@pavilion.co.uk), which contains 2,000 titles. He says that he knows these titles exist because he has them or has seen all of them. Ignoring the many smutty ones here are a few titles: Barbs, Prongs, Points, Prickers and Stickers: A Complete and Illustrated Catalogue of Antique Barbed Wire, and A Hundred and Forty Ways of Spelling Birmingham. The book is very amusing, but do these tomes amount to a collectible field? Brian Lake says: \"When I started this 20 years ago there were a number of collectors in California with big collections. Now it is growing here. Let me put it this way. I have a window display in my shop opposite the British Museum of 80 of these books. They are not for sale but I could sell them 20 times over. One book called Fish Who Answer The Telephone, which I thought was worth \u00a315, I sold to an Italian film director who insisted on paying \u00a350 for it. Brian Lake does not have the field all to himself. At the Fair will be Roger Treglown, a Cheshire dealer specialising in chess. He says Bizarre Books are very specialised but there is growing interest. He has on offer: The Resistance of Piles to Penetration, London 1950 - about civil engineering at \u00a3145 - and The Cement and Concrete Association: How Concrete Can Help the Pig Breeder, London 1950, at \u00a310. Modern Firsts were given a push when a book was published about them, so you never know. \u0095 Readers wanting to visit the Fair can obtain a free ticket for June 9 onwards by ringing the ABA office on 020-7439-3118.",

If they want to climb higher on the greasy political pole, nothing will help their ascent more than a judiciously chosen, politically correct present for the fourth young Blair.</p> <p>But because they are more accustomed to the corridors of power than the aisles of Mothercare, Jobs &amp; Money this week is kindly offering them some guidance on what and where to buy that present. Infant clothing is a safe bet for a gift and if those Labour MPs take heed of our advice, Cherie will be saved from a mountain of Babygros. There is a lot out there to spend your money on.</p> <p>Consensus has it that the Blairs are Baby Gap sort of parents, but they might be swayed by clothes from Young England if their Euro sentiments don't rule out classic British baby style.</p> <p>The company has launched a mail order service with items such as a white duck-smocked romper at \u00a359 or a white baby nightgown embroidered with ducks at \u00a329.50. It is also available with blue bears or pink rabbits, but you're taking a risk on the sex with that. Young England also sells quality Babygros in cotton jersey at \u00a328 or short-sleeved rompers in the same fabric for \u00a327. For a mere \u00a380 you can buy a button-on suit for the older baby with blue Oxford cotton bottoms and a white shirt. There is also a range of traditional children's clothes in high quality fabrics.</p> <p>Department stores are always a good place to look and the exclusive Hoopers group, with branches in Wilmslow, Torquay, Harrogate and Tunbridge Wells, sells deeply trendy children's wear by Kenzo, Marese, Miniman, Jean Bourget and Petit Bateau.</p> <p>All-in-ones from Bourget are \u00a334 and from Petit Bateau they cost from \u00a320 to \u00a330. Its best seller is a navy blue version with a one- button grandad collar. The Bourget range for slightly older babies and children comes in sophisticated neutrals and includes things like a hooded sweat top at \u00a322.95. There are co-ordinating hats, socks and bootees. The Kenzo baby range is very fashion conscious, says Hoopers, with leggings at \u00a320, t-shirts at \u00a314.95, cardigans at \u00a325 and sweatshirts at \u00a320. Dresses for girls cost \u00a335, but just think of the label.</p> <p>And if the baby is a boy, some buying for the future could include Timberland sweatshirts at \u00a329.95, dungarees at \u00a330, shorts at \u00a324 and an outdoor jacket at \u00a354.</p> <p>Selfridges also specialises in international brands at its Kids' Universe section. The Oxford Street store reports that one of its new lines, the stylish French Chipie, is selling out fast. The range is denim-based with baby dungarees at \u00a332.99 and \u00a342.99, dresses at \u00a329.99 and t-shirts at \u00a312.99 and \u00a317.99. The Trussardi range has body suits at \u00a329.99 and sleepwear at \u00a324, \u00a326 and \u00a332 and there is a pack of three hats at \u00a329.99.</p> <p>The eco-conscious can give gifts from a company like Spirit of Nature which produces underwear, sleepwear and rompers in undyed and unbleached 100% organic cotton. There is a beige striped range from cotton grown on recultivated land by Peruvian Indians. A bodysuit is \u00a310.29, a sleepsuit \u00a319.29, leggings \u00a37.09 and booties \u00a35.49. Its Sea and Sand range in sassy nautical stripes has t-shirts at \u00a311.90 and shorts at \u00a310.50.

Its furniture is made by local craftspeople - one is in Rye, Sussex.</p> <p>A favourite buy is the nursery chair with the child's name and date of birth painted on it. They cost \u00a340 with rush seats in four designs. A painted sleigh bed will set you back \u00a3380 (mattress not included), crib, \u00a3130, chests of drawers range from \u00a3310 to \u00a3380 and a child's wardrobe is \u00a3360.</p> <p>Other items include stools with names at \u00a330, a fish mobile at \u00a335 and a series of jolly toys and games.

Hands are more expensive at \u00a3440 for bronze, \u00a3480 for glass and \u00a3385 for silver. They can be mounted on marble or presented loose and Wrightson says people like to handle them and use them as paperweights. \"Glass is more fragile but it adds another dimension,\" she says.</p> <p>And finally, a word in Tony's ear. Since conspicuous consumption is no longer off limits, take a look at Cartier's new mother and baby jewellery. Tender Toys are based on Meccano and come in small yellow and white gold pieces - pram, tricycle, rocking horse and car to be worn on a child's charm bracelet or by the mother as a pendant, at \u00a3630 each. Tender Bestiaire are dove, koala or elephant mother and offspring brooches in white or yellow gold with diamonds. Prices from \u00a31,750 to \u00a34,350.

      "body": "<p>A trail of blue smoke tomorrow will trace the course of one of the odder triangular relationships in literary history - between George Bernard Shaw, Lawrence of Arabia, and a classic British motorbike.</p> <p>A cavalcade of members of the Brough Superior Owners Club, riding hugely valuable museum pieces - each worth between the price of a small house, and the price of a very large house - will make the 150-mile journey from Clouds Hill in Dorset, home of T E Lawrence, to Shaw's Corner at Ayot Saint Lawrence, Shaw's hideous home in Hertfordshire. It was a trip Lawrence made hundreds of times on his Brough Superior, before dying in a crash on one in 1935.</p> <p>The rally this year commemorates the 50th anniversary of Shaw's death in the house, in November 1950, after he fell out of an apple tree at the age of 94.</p> <p>On the surface, the grumpy pacifist iconoclast had little in common with the war hero author of Seven Pillars of Wisdom - apart from a weakness for inordinately long prefaces. In fact, the two men became firm friends.</p> <p>Lawrence was so in awe of Shaw that he only agreed to visit his house with a friend on the assurance that the great man was away. Shaw was home, and the men took an instant liking to one another, which surprised both of them.</p> <p>Shaw called him \"a very strange fellow, a born actor and up to all sorts of tricks\". The rally is due to arrive at Shaw's Corner, now owned by the National Trust, at 4pm, and the bikes will remain on display at the house until 6pm.</p> <p>Lawrence was a dashing motor cyclist, covering thousands of miles on a succession of Brough Superiors. Shaw, safer on his bicycle with the specially lengthened frame to fit his spindleshanks, was the terror of the village on his two stroke, frequently colliding with stationary objects or falling off.</p> <p>The Brough Superiors were hand built in Nottingham between 1921 and 1939 when the family firm closed. Their slogan was \"the Rolls Royce of motor-cycles\". Only 3,000 were built, of which an estimated 1,000 survive. Rally organiser Justin Wand will be riding his 1926 Brough SS100: \"It was designed in 1925 and guaranteed to have a top speed of 100 mph, an absolute phenomenom at a time when most cars pootled along at about 35 mph.\"</p> <p>The most valuable ever sold is the missing link in tomorrow's parade. Lawrence owned seven of the motorbikes in all. The one which was a present from Shaw and his wife was sold in the US for almost $4m.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A trail of blue smoke tomorrow will trace the course of one of the odder triangular relationships in literary history - between George Bernard Shaw, Lawrence of Arabia, and a classic British motorbike. A cavalcade of members of the Brough Superior Owners Club, riding hugely valuable museum pieces - each worth between the price of a small house, and the price of a very large house - will make the 150-mile journey from Clouds Hill in Dorset, home of T E Lawrence, to Shaw's Corner at Ayot Saint Lawrence, Shaw's hideous home in Hertfordshire. It was a trip Lawrence made hundreds of times on his Brough Superior, before dying in a crash on one in 1935. The rally this year commemorates the 50th anniversary of Shaw's death in the house, in November 1950, after he fell out of an apple tree at the age of 94. On the surface, the grumpy pacifist iconoclast had little in common with the war hero author of Seven Pillars of Wisdom - apart from a weakness for inordinately long prefaces. In fact, the two men became firm friends. Lawrence was so in awe of Shaw that he only agreed to visit his house with a friend on the assurance that the great man was away. Shaw was home, and the men took an instant liking to one another, which surprised both of them. Shaw called him \"a very strange fellow, a born actor and up to all sorts of tricks\". The rally is due to arrive at Shaw's Corner, now owned by the National Trust, at 4pm, and the bikes will remain on display at the house until 6pm. Lawrence was a dashing motor cyclist, covering thousands of miles on a succession of Brough Superiors. Shaw, safer on his bicycle with the specially lengthened frame to fit his spindleshanks, was the terror of the village on his two stroke, frequently colliding with stationary objects or falling off. The Brough Superiors were hand built in Nottingham between 1921 and 1939 when the family firm closed. Their slogan was \"the Rolls Royce of motor-cycles\". Only 3,000 were built, of which an estimated 1,000 survive. Rally organiser Justin Wand will be riding his 1926 Brough SS100: \"It was designed in 1925 and guaranteed to have a top speed of 100 mph, an absolute phenomenom at a time when most cars pootled along at about 35 mph.\" The most valuable ever sold is the missing link in tomorrow's parade. Lawrence owned seven of the motorbikes in all. The one which was a present from Shaw and his wife was sold in the US for almost $4m.",

      "bodyText": "A moratorium on the building of all new incinerators, until British scientific research rules out a cancer risk, was called for yesterday by Archie Norman, the Tory party's environment spokesman. This will increase pressure on Michael Meacher, the environment minister, who is expected next week to give the go-ahead to a new chain of incinerators as part of the government's waste strategy. The Tory party's policy appears to be aimed at opening up a new front against the government and seizing the green agenda in the same way that William Hague took on Tony Blair over law and order. Alongside the ban on new incinerators are a host of policies traditionally associated with opposition from the Liberal Democrats. These include the building of municipal composters - similar to the giant one on the Isle of Wight - and a commitment to recycling, including a guarantee that the local dustcart will provide a recycling service to every home in Britain. The Tories promise more cash for local councils to increase recycling and end landfill dumping and a new \"zero waste agency\" to spearhead the initiative. Householders will also be offered subsidised rainwater butts and composters to encourage recycling. The new Conservative policy also calls for tougher penalties for companies caught illegally dumping waste and pledges to name and shame councils with poor recycling records. It says: \"We will introduce a moratorium on new incinerators until independent British scientific evidence proves they are safe. Labour have failed to meet the challenge of recycling...

Renting, say well-meaning friends and relatives, amounts to pouring money down the drain. Far better to get something for your money - a little corner you can call your own even if in truth it is owned by a bank or building society.</p> <p>But this is only half the picture. Renting is still cheaper than buying in some of the most desirable areas of London. Most of us wouldn't get anywhere near the asking price for a Knightsbridge pied-\u00e1-terre but could afford to rent a broom cupboard with a smart postcode.</p> <p>And when the property market is going mad, would-be buyers may be well advised to hold on to their cash and keep saving while waiting for the market to calm down.</p> <p>Naturally, the lenders are eager for us to see the advantages of buying a home. Abbey National says it has firm evidence that buying the average UK home can be as much as 42% - or \u00a3129,000 - cheaper than renting over 25 years. Even though house prices are shooting through the roof in many parts of the country, house buyers can still save thousands of pounds by climbing on to the property ladder, says the bank.</p> <p>Savings can vary from a few thousand pounds to about \u00a3255,000 depending on the size of the house and where you live in the country. When the difference is so marked, renters should ask themselves whether they are happy to pay for their landlord's fast cars, says Miles Bingham, head of mortgage marketing at the Abbey.</p> <p>In the south-east the average home-owner saves \u00a3172,598, closely followed by East Anglia where the saving is \u00a3166,000. But direct price comparisons do not take into account the overall price of owning a home. The Abbey National's calculations have included the basic cost of main-taining a property but few homeowners are content to do just that.</p> <p>They install kitchens, bathrooms, a loft conversion. They make over bedrooms, gardens and build exten sions. Savings are needed just to cover the cost of buying and selling. The recent hike in stamp duty has hit movers in property hot spots hard, adding \u00a31,500 to the cost of buying a \u00a3300,000 home.</p> <p>But there are other hidden costs according to the Woolwich's annual cost of moving survey. The average price of local authority and other searches has risen by nearly 28% to \u00a3101, irrespective of the value of the property. Solicitors' charges too are up, typically 8% to 9%.</p> <p>This all means that a buyer would need to find an additional \u00a37,222 to cover the extra cost of moving from a \u00a3250,000 to a \u00a3300,000 property. Renters, on the other hand, don't live in fear of negative equity and are not responsible for the property they live in.</p> <p>Long-term renter Gill South, aged 34, is bemused by her friends' enthusiasm for getting a foot on the property ladder.

      "bodyText": "It is supposed to be one of those indisputable facts of life that buying a home is cheaper than renting. Renting, say well-meaning friends and relatives, amounts to pouring money down the drain. Far better to get something for your money - a little corner you can call your own even if in truth it is owned by a bank or building society. But this is only half the picture. Renting is still cheaper than buying in some of the most desirable areas of London. Most of us wouldn't get anywhere near the asking price for a Knightsbridge pied-\u00e1-terre but could afford to rent a broom cupboard with a smart postcode. And when the property market is going mad, would-be buyers may be well advised to hold on to their cash and keep saving while waiting for the market to calm down. Naturally, the lenders are eager for us to see the advantages of buying a home. Abbey National says it has firm evidence that buying the average UK home can be as much as 42% - or \u00a3129,000 - cheaper than renting over 25 years. Even though house prices are shooting through the roof in many parts of the country, house buyers can still save thousands of pounds by climbing on to the property ladder, says the bank. Savings can vary from a few thousand pounds to about \u00a3255,000 depending on the size of the house and where you live in the country. When the difference is so marked, renters should ask themselves whether they are happy to pay for their landlord's fast cars, says Miles Bingham, head of mortgage marketing at the Abbey. In the south-east the average home-owner saves \u00a3172,598, closely followed by East Anglia where the saving is \u00a3166,000. But direct price comparisons do not take into account the overall price of owning a home. The Abbey National's calculations have included the basic cost of main-taining a property but few homeowners are content to do just that. They install kitchens, bathrooms, a loft conversion. They make over bedrooms, gardens and build exten sions. Savings are needed just to cover the cost of buying and selling. The recent hike in stamp duty has hit movers in property hot spots hard, adding \u00a31,500 to the cost of buying a \u00a3300,000 home. But there are other hidden costs according to the Woolwich's annual cost of moving survey. The average price of local authority and other searches has risen by nearly 28% to \u00a3101, irrespective of the value of the property. Solicitors' charges too are up, typically 8% to 9%. This all means that a buyer would need to find an additional \u00a37,222 to cover the extra cost of moving from a \u00a3250,000 to a \u00a3300,000 property. Renters, on the other hand, don't live in fear of negative equity and are not responsible for the property they live in. Long-term renter Gill South, aged 34, is bemused by her friends' enthusiasm for getting a foot on the property ladder. She and her husband are renting a spacious one-bedroom flat in Muswell Hill, North London for \u00a3750 per month. \"There is a feeling here that you are a second- class citizen if you are renting, but you do feel very free knowing you can move after just six months' notice,\" says Ms South. She says the great thing about renting is having someone to call when something breaks. Although sometimes you need to hassle landlords it is still their responsibility and not yours. \"We were living in Holloway and decided we wanted something a bit nicer.

Ms South originally hails from New Zealand, where renting is much more commonplace. \"People don't buy in their early 20s there.

The young adult male was found on moorland near Pateley Bridge, north Yorkshire, after messages from a micro-transmitter attached to the bird on release indicated it had stopped flying. The body of the kite, a russet-coloured hawk whose numbers reached a national low of 12 because of shooting and poisoning, was traced to an area where its reintroduction was resisted last year by gamekeepers and grouse-shooting syndicates. Tests showed it had eaten an illegal rat poison, alphachloralose, although it is not clear whether the bird was deliberately targeted or chanced to scavenge rabbits being controlled by contaminated bait. The death is a serious blow to attempts to start a breeding colony of red kites in the north, building on the success of an experiment in Wales. The breed, recognisable by its slender wings, distinctive V-tail and mewing call, was saved from extinction by Welsh enthusiasts who saw numbers rise to more than 50 by the mid-80s. Deliberate poisonings have since affected the Welsh colony, but the death at Pateley Bridge is the first loss in the north since 23 kites were released last year on the Harewood estate near Leeds. \"The loss of this bird is an outrage,\" said Andy Bunten, Yorkshire regional officer for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which is working with English Nature on the project. \"The use of poison in the countryside is illegal and dangerous.\" Harewood estate manager, Christopher Ussher, said the released colony co-existed with game birds, but the kites have been blamed by gamekeepers and shooting interests for taking pheasant and grouse chicks from the moors.

The relatively lenient sentence appeared to ease fears that violence would worsen if he were jailed. Reuters, Harare Paraguay coup attempt fails Paraguay's government said that forces loyal to fugitive coup leader Gen Lino Oviedo drove tanks through the capital, Asuncion, and blasted a hole in Congress before surrendering yesterday. Security forces arrested a lawyer, a congressman, five retired officers and at least 25 serving soldiers. Reuters, Asuncion Peru election in turmoil Peru's top election body yesterday refused to postpone a May 28 presidential vote even though the opposition candidate vowed not to run unless there was a three-week delay. Alejandro Toledo had refused to take part in the run-off against President Alberto Fujimori without a delay, saying there was insufficient to ensure the vote was fair.

      "bodyText": "An incy-wincy spider and a goat called Peter are poised to pool their natural resources to produce a material so strong that the Pentagon wants to use it in its anti-ballistic defence systems. This latest improbable sounding biotechnology breakthrough means that goats' milk produced on a farm in the rolling countryside east of Montreal will help produce a substance 10 times stronger than steel but with the flexibility needed for stitching in the most delicate of medical operations. Large scale production of the super-strong material, to be known as BioSteel, will begin later this year. The new product has been created by implanting spider genes into a specially bred herd of tiny brown goats. This results in the production of silky protein strands in the goats' milk which can be extracted and spun into BioSteel fibres. All that is needed now is for Peter and his fellow African dwarf goat Webster, currently chomping hay on a Quebec farm, to sire sufficient nannies to begin the production phase. Once Peter and Webster have spread themselves about sufficiently, the Quebec based Nexia Biotechnologies company expects to be able to produce ultra-light bullet-resistant vests for soldiers and police, which is why the project has stirred such interest from both the US and the Canadian military. \"It's a pretty effective system\", Nexia boss Jeffrey Turner says. \"What you need is probably the production from one goat in one month to produce a vest.\" If this all seems to belong to science fiction, then the science fact is that Mr Turner believes that Peter's baby goats enable him to capture the strength and elasticity of spider silk in a way which overcomes the inherent production problems which would exist with an inherently unmanageable spider farm. \"An inch-thick rope of this material would be able to stop a jet fighter landing on an aircraft carrier,\" says Dr Randy Lewis of the University of Wyoming, who has also spearheaded attempts to produce spider silk outside the spider. The fibre has two major potentials, first in advanced industrial applications such as ballistic protection and aerospace, and second in medical devices such as suturing and artificial tendons. Peter and Webster were bred successfully at the start of this year. They each carry a single spider silk gene in their genetic make-up of some 70,000 goat genes. Since they became sexually mature this spring, they have been set to work siring the silk producing herd. \"We've combined the old and the new,\" Mr Turner told an interviewer this week. \"The old is represented by the goats and their milk - which is used to make cheese.

      "body": "<p>William Hague says he means to break with the gutless liberal consensus which has governed British attitudes to law and order over the postwar years. Many Tories will cheer. But others will be more sceptical. Is Hague really ready to make the break with the recent past which he promises, and sweep us back to the good old days? I see little sign of it. I suspect he has yet to make contact with Councillor Edward Trevor, Conservative representative for the South Cheam ward of the London Borough of Sutton. </p> <p>Asked by the Sutton and Cheam Guardian (no relation to this one) what should be done to the hooligans who recently ravaged the ornamental gardens in Nonsuch Park, he said it was no use chucking such people in jail. \"It just costs the taxpayer a lot of money,\" he said. \"This sort of thing is done by a lot of yobbos and these days there is insufficient punishment thanks to the do-gooders. They should have a hand or an ear cut off.\" I understand there is a Mr Sankoh in Sierra Leone who has just lost his job and could probably give the councillor a tip or two. </p> <p>\u0095 But at least what he says is unspun. I begin to think that, in every sense, the concept of spin doctors has had its day. (Please note that I do not use the vulgar expression \"past its sell-by date\" which by now should have been retired to the Archive of British Clich\u00e9, along with \"to kill for\".) It is not entirely clear where the expression sprang from. I had always associated it with cricket: spin doctors are there to make the story deviate from the straight truth, much as spin bowlers cause the ball to deviate from a straight line. But the term comes from the US, where precious few spin bowlers practise, so that can't be it. </p> <p>I see that \"being spun\" is equated in some dictionaries with being twisted, and there are also odd connections with other nefarious practices. I did not know until now, for instance, that a spinning house was a place of correction to which lewd and incorrigible women used to be sent. Why such people should be equated with doctors is altogether more curious. In earlier days, when practitioners by and large knew what they were doing, that connection was supportable. But the present generation, who try to persuade gullible Labour MPs to pretend that this month's local elections were a triumph for Labour and a terminal setback for Hague, do not deserve such a designation. </p> <p>I think the term we should use from now on is \"flamster\". Their techniques go little further than flamming. The word \"flam\", by the way, appears to derive either from \"flimflam\" (defined as a nonsense, or confidence trick) or from \"flamfew\" (a bauble or trifle). The main meaning of flam nowadays is a blarney or deceit: a comparable concept is hype. All of which seems extremely apposite. The fact that \"flamster\" also evokes a kind of inflamed hamster seems wholly appropriate too. </p> <p>\u0095 Publication of a volume of poems by the late William Empson has led a number of newspapers to publish photographs of the poet in quite advanced age. I find the beard he displays quite remarkable. Empson made his name in his twenties with a book called Seven Types Of Ambiguity and one cannot but think that this also applies to his beard. Most people's beards proceed from their chins, but Empson's chin was clean shaven. His beard (these photographs suggest) came directly out of his neck. </p> <p>Indeed, when looked at without one's glasses, it resembles a kind of ruff, suggesting some practical purpose, like keeping his neck warm in winter. (Did he shave it off every spring and grow it again every autumn?) I think I have seen beards like this in photographs of local yokels on the walls of country pubs, but I do not remember encountering any in real life. </p> <p> A reader has kindly sent the following gem, which comes from the editor's notes to a book called The Aran Islands by JM Synge (Penguin, 1992). \"Franz Nikolaus Finck spent four months in Aran in 1894/5 researching his thesis.

      "bodyText": "William Hague says he means to break with the gutless liberal consensus which has governed British attitudes to law and order over the postwar years. Many Tories will cheer. But others will be more sceptical. Is Hague really ready to make the break with the recent past which he promises, and sweep us back to the good old days? I see little sign of it. I suspect he has yet to make contact with Councillor Edward Trevor, Conservative representative for the South Cheam ward of the London Borough of Sutton. Asked by the Sutton and Cheam Guardian (no relation to this one) what should be done to the hooligans who recently ravaged the ornamental gardens in Nonsuch Park, he said it was no use chucking such people in jail. \"It just costs the taxpayer a lot of money,\" he said. \"This sort of thing is done by a lot of yobbos and these days there is insufficient punishment thanks to the do-gooders. They should have a hand or an ear cut off.\" I understand there is a Mr Sankoh in Sierra Leone who has just lost his job and could probably give the councillor a tip or two. \u0095 But at least what he says is unspun. I begin to think that, in every sense, the concept of spin doctors has had its day. (Please note that I do not use the vulgar expression \"past its sell-by date\" which by now should have been retired to the Archive of British Clich\u00e9, along with \"to kill for\".) It is not entirely clear where the expression sprang from. I had always associated it with cricket: spin doctors are there to make the story deviate from the straight truth, much as spin bowlers cause the ball to deviate from a straight line. But the term comes from the US, where precious few spin bowlers practise, so that can't be it. I see that \"being spun\" is equated in some dictionaries with being twisted, and there are also odd connections with other nefarious practices. I did not know until now, for instance, that a spinning house was a place of correction to which lewd and incorrigible women used to be sent. Why such people should be equated with doctors is altogether more curious. In earlier days, when practitioners by and large knew what they were doing, that connection was supportable. But the present generation, who try to persuade gullible Labour MPs to pretend that this month's local elections were a triumph for Labour and a terminal setback for Hague, do not deserve such a designation. I think the term we should use from now on is \"flamster\". Their techniques go little further than flamming. The word \"flam\", by the way, appears to derive either from \"flimflam\" (defined as a nonsense, or confidence trick) or from \"flamfew\" (a bauble or trifle). The main meaning of flam nowadays is a blarney or deceit: a comparable concept is hype. All of which seems extremely apposite. The fact that \"flamster\" also evokes a kind of inflamed hamster seems wholly appropriate too. \u0095 Publication of a volume of poems by the late William Empson has led a number of newspapers to publish photographs of the poet in quite advanced age. I find the beard he displays quite remarkable. Empson made his name in his twenties with a book called Seven Types Of Ambiguity and one cannot but think that this also applies to his beard. Most people's beards proceed from their chins, but Empson's chin was clean shaven. His beard (these photographs suggest) came directly out of his neck. Indeed, when looked at without one's glasses, it resembles a kind of ruff, suggesting some practical purpose, like keeping his neck warm in winter. (Did he shave it off every spring and grow it again every autumn?) I think I have seen beards like this in photographs of local yokels on the walls of country pubs, but I do not remember encountering any in real life. A reader has kindly sent the following gem, which comes from the editor's notes to a book called The Aran Islands by JM Synge (Penguin, 1992). \"Franz Nikolaus Finck spent four months in Aran in 1894/5 researching his thesis. An Aran-born writer, the late Breand\u00e1n \u00d3 hEithir, has disinterred from this work the phrase \"Ni bh\u00e9arfainn broim dre\u00f3l\u00edn ar dhuilleog cuilinn agus is beag an puth gaoth \u00e9 sin!\" (I wouldn't give the fart of a wren on a holly-leaf, and it's the small puff of wind that is) which the linguistic anarchs of Synge's plays would be hard pressed to emulate.\" I commend this line to students of vituperation, while hoping it will be quoted in the original only. \u0095 The festivities to mark the Queen Mother's attainment this coming July of the grand old age of 99 years, 11 months are now to be televised on the ITV channel.

      "body": "<p>This is the man asking the questions. The head of the Gartmore fund management group has set his peers almost 50 brainteasers about an industry in which he has spent most of his 30-year career. But Paul Myners, who is also non-executive chairman of Guardian Media Group which publishes the Guardian, insists he is not going to second-guess the answers. </p> <p>Myners' list, which threatens to turn the arcane world of pensions and insurance investment upside down, was drawn up during a Caribbean holiday. He has until the next budget to establish why the country's leading investors, who between them control \u00a3800bn of assets, plough the bulk of their money into the same companies, starving new business of cash. </p> <p>The problem, which Myners describes as a \"consensual\" way of investing, is at the core of Gordon Brown's aim to boost productivity and innovation and promote longer-term investment. The premise is to establish why the country's pension funds put 0.5% of their investments into venture capital while US investors channel 5% of assets towards young enterprises. </p> <p>If the investigation cracks City orthodoxy and fund managers change their ways, the performance of their funds could improve which should mean lower pension contributions for workers and a better quality of retirement. </p> <p><strong> Open mind</strong><br> </p> <p> \"This is linked to productivity, it's about promoting national competitive advantage through innovation,\" says Myners. Explaining how the industry became trapped in a conservative mindset, where pension fund trustees increasingly trust their assets to investment managers who track market indices rather than make decisions about individual stocks, is far from easy. Encouraging a fresher way of thinking will be tougher still. </p> <p>On Myners' hit list, for example, is the way a pension fund's performance is measured - every 90 days even though the fund might have a 70-year life - and the effect on investment decisions. The investigation is in its early days but Myners is already facing jibes - chiefly that he is too much of an insider and his own group Gartmore, which he has run since 1985, is guilty of the shortcomings he is now digging into. Others ask why the industry needs an investigation, citing unnecessary and costly government meddling. </p> <p>Conversely, the Financial Times has toyed with the idea that he could become Sir Paul if he gets to the bottom of the matter. The 52-year-old finds this dis tracting and repeats that he is approaching the investigation with an \"open mind,\" although he was described by one commentator last week as an \"amiable lunatic\" for taking on the role. </p> <p>An indication of his concerns might be his view about how fund performance has been measured since the 1970s, a \"tool that was originally intended to enlighten and inform and has now become a tool of entrapment\". The charge is that quarterly league tables focus people on the short term, not just the fund managers but also the trustees. \"There has to be accountability. The question is appropriateness,\" he says. </p> <p>Myners sees his questions as critically important to the health of the economy. \"They are all inter-related; it's how the trustees link to goal-setting, to consultants, to performance measurement and to regulation,\" he says. \"You need to understand all those to comprehend why we appear to have developed very very consensual activity.\" </p> <p>Among regulations with which Myners will grapple are minimum funding requirements for pension funds and insolvency ratios for insurance companies. </p> <p>The review lends itself to comparison with the controversial investigation into banking competition by Don Cruickshank commissioned for this year's budget and which resulted in a competition commission inquiry into banking for small and medium sized business. Myners dislikes the comparison and hopes his \"journey of enquiry\" will have far-reaching consequences for everyone. </p> <p>\"Ask any fund manager 'if you could invest for 10 years would you invest the money differently?'. I think it beggars belief that they wouldn't say yes,\" he says. </p> <p>Of all the criticisms bounced at Myners, he rushes to defend Gartmore, which suffered from pension fund consultants who brought clients in the early 1990s only to switch their loyalty when performance spluttered. (The Guardian pension fund was one client to move in the early 1990s.) \"In the last 20 years Gartmore has outperformed in 16. We underperformed in four, three of which, like London buses, came in a row in 1995, 1996, 1997,\" he says. </p> <p>He dismisses suggestions that Gartmore has become an index-tracking firm. It is through Gartmore that Myners has achieved personal wealth, overseeing three changes in ownership during 15 years at the helm. Each time, he says proudly, the new owners have doubled their money in less than four years. The most recent change was two months ago when Gartmore was sold to Nationwide Mutual of the US, after being discarded by Royal Bank of Scotland, the new owners of NatWest. </p> <p>Myners steered through the change of ownership from a group which had previously fired him, when NatWest was trying to clinch a merger with Legal &amp; General last year. </p> <p>He admits to feeling \"pretty awful\" as he stumbled from the offices of NatWest's advisers one afternoon but nevertheless pays tribute to Sir David Rowland, the NatWest chairman who sacked him and then asked him to stay on to help try to fend off the hostile bids by Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland. </p> <p><strong> On his bike</strong><br> </p> <p> Myners might not have ended up in the City at all.

      "bodyText": "This is the man asking the questions. The head of the Gartmore fund management group has set his peers almost 50 brainteasers about an industry in which he has spent most of his 30-year career. But Paul Myners, who is also non-executive chairman of Guardian Media Group which publishes the Guardian, insists he is not going to second-guess the answers. Myners' list, which threatens to turn the arcane world of pensions and insurance investment upside down, was drawn up during a Caribbean holiday. He has until the next budget to establish why the country's leading investors, who between them control \u00a3800bn of assets, plough the bulk of their money into the same companies, starving new business of cash. The problem, which Myners describes as a \"consensual\" way of investing, is at the core of Gordon Brown's aim to boost productivity and innovation and promote longer-term investment. The premise is to establish why the country's pension funds put 0.5% of their investments into venture capital while US investors channel 5% of assets towards young enterprises. If the investigation cracks City orthodoxy and fund managers change their ways, the performance of their funds could improve which should mean lower pension contributions for workers and a better quality of retirement. Open mind \"This is linked to productivity, it's about promoting national competitive advantage through innovation,\" says Myners. Explaining how the industry became trapped in a conservative mindset, where pension fund trustees increasingly trust their assets to investment managers who track market indices rather than make decisions about individual stocks, is far from easy. Encouraging a fresher way of thinking will be tougher still. On Myners' hit list, for example, is the way a pension fund's performance is measured - every 90 days even though the fund might have a 70-year life - and the effect on investment decisions. The investigation is in its early days but Myners is already facing jibes - chiefly that he is too much of an insider and his own group Gartmore, which he has run since 1985, is guilty of the shortcomings he is now digging into. Others ask why the industry needs an investigation, citing unnecessary and costly government meddling. Conversely, the Financial Times has toyed with the idea that he could become Sir Paul if he gets to the bottom of the matter. The 52-year-old finds this dis tracting and repeats that he is approaching the investigation with an \"open mind,\" although he was described by one commentator last week as an \"amiable lunatic\" for taking on the role. An indication of his concerns might be his view about how fund performance has been measured since the 1970s, a \"tool that was originally intended to enlighten and inform and has now become a tool of entrapment\". The charge is that quarterly league tables focus people on the short term, not just the fund managers but also the trustees. \"There has to be accountability. The question is appropriateness,\" he says. Myners sees his questions as critically important to the health of the economy. \"They are all inter-related; it's how the trustees link to goal-setting, to consultants, to performance measurement and to regulation,\" he says. \"You need to understand all those to comprehend why we appear to have developed very very consensual activity.\" Among regulations with which Myners will grapple are minimum funding requirements for pension funds and insolvency ratios for insurance companies. The review lends itself to comparison with the controversial investigation into banking competition by Don Cruickshank commissioned for this year's budget and which resulted in a competition commission inquiry into banking for small and medium sized business. Myners dislikes the comparison and hopes his \"journey of enquiry\" will have far-reaching consequences for everyone. \"Ask any fund manager 'if you could invest for 10 years would you invest the money differently?'. I think it beggars belief that they wouldn't say yes,\" he says. Of all the criticisms bounced at Myners, he rushes to defend Gartmore, which suffered from pension fund consultants who brought clients in the early 1990s only to switch their loyalty when performance spluttered. (The Guardian pension fund was one client to move in the early 1990s.) \"In the last 20 years Gartmore has outperformed in 16. We underperformed in four, three of which, like London buses, came in a row in 1995, 1996, 1997,\" he says. He dismisses suggestions that Gartmore has become an index-tracking firm. It is through Gartmore that Myners has achieved personal wealth, overseeing three changes in ownership during 15 years at the helm. Each time, he says proudly, the new owners have doubled their money in less than four years. The most recent change was two months ago when Gartmore was sold to Nationwide Mutual of the US, after being discarded by Royal Bank of Scotland, the new owners of NatWest. Myners steered through the change of ownership from a group which had previously fired him, when NatWest was trying to clinch a merger with Legal &amp; General last year. He admits to feeling \"pretty awful\" as he stumbled from the offices of NatWest's advisers one afternoon but nevertheless pays tribute to Sir David Rowland, the NatWest chairman who sacked him and then asked him to stay on to help try to fend off the hostile bids by Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland. On his bike Myners might not have ended up in the City at all. Adopted from an orphanage in Bath by a Cornish couple - \"I know nothing about my natural parents, I don't wish to\" - he spent his childhood in Cornwall before obtaining a first class degree in education. Two terms at a Wandsworth girls comprehensive put him off and got him on his bike - literally, because of a postal strike - around City firms to look for work. Wedd Durlacher, later part of the now-defunct BZW investment bank, gave him his break. He then completed a stint at the Daily Telegraph, where he is said to have told colleagues that he would not be around long as he wanted to make money. Myners says he has \"no recollection\" of his motivator. \"I think I've been very fortunate to be part of a successful business and that's given me much more satisfaction than working for pay,\" he says. Myners divides his time between the City and the Cornish home where his second wife lives with their two young children (he has three from his first marriage).

The most popular plays in London are by writers such as Frayn, Bennett, Nichols and Plater, all of whom are technically eligible for bus passes. And further proof that creativity is not dimmed by age comes from Arnold Wesker's Denial, which deals with false memory syndrome. </p> <p>Wesker himself is the victim not so much of repressed memories as of exaggerated nostalgia. In Britain, we prize so highly his early works - The Kitchen, Roots, Chips with Everything - that we tend to downgrade everything he has written since. One reason, I suspect, is that we favour obliqueness over Wesker's brand of emotional directness. </p> <p>If I have any personal regret it is that Wesker now largely forswears the kind of choreographed action that characterised his early, autobiographical plays. No one can forget the lunch-hour pandemonium of The Kitchen or the night-time raid on the coke store in Chips with Everything. As Wesker once said in an interview, \"The theatre is a place where one goes to see things happening.\" But, as he has increasingly focused on ideas or moral dilemmas, he has scaled down dramatic action. </p> <p>Throughout his career, however, one subject has always dominated Wesker's thinking: family cohesiveness. As Tynan shrewdly noted in 1960, \"His characters belong together, even when they are not on speaking terms with each other.\" And it is the attempt to dissolve the molten security of family that is the real subject of Denial. </p> <p>In 21 scenes and 90 minutes, Wesker shows Jenny, whose marriage and career have broken down, accusing her father of raping her as a child; even her mother and grandfather have been complicit in persistent sexual abuse. Needless to say, the accusations come at the prompting of a therapist, Valerie, who is seeking the cause of Jenny's depression. But is she unlocking genuinely repressed memories or seeking a facile explanation for Jenny's problems? </p> <p>The danger in a play on this theme is obvious: of lapsing into therapist-as-villain melodrama. But, with considerable dramatic cunning, Wesker largely avoids that trap. As played by Susan Tracy, Wesker's Valerie at first seems maternal, caring and indignant at the vilification she and fellow therapists have to endure. As she explains to a TV interviewer, she is the one who has seen \"eight-year-olds with vaginas burst open by cycle pumps, young boys with gaping anuses, children who shud der at your touch\". What she cannot forgive is violation of childhood trust. </p> <p>But, as the play progresses, we see that Valerie, haunted by her experiences as a Cardiff social worker, seeks a catch-all solution to complex problems. In slowly shifting the balance of sympathy, Wesker also comes up with one of the most honest admissions I've heard on the British stage in a long time: the acknowledgement by Jenny's father that there is a tactile pleasure in the bathing, handling and kissing of children that stops short of sexual abuse. The speech is delivered by Jeremy Child with fervent candour. It also underlines Wesker's key point: that proven child abuse is wicked, but if we deny the joy of sensual physical contact between parent and child we are destroying family life. </p> <p>Even if the play is not perfect - the family friend unable to repress his own memories of the Nazi death camps smacks too much of an antithetical device - it is brave, honest and urgent. It is also well directed by Andy Hay, neatly designed by Tom Piper, and strongly acted by all concerned, including Nicola Barber as the accusatory Jenny and Rosemary McHale as her defiant mother. In the end, the play is a vehement assertion of the validity of the nuclear family and of the pleasurable intimacy of the parent-child relationship.

      "body": "<p>When I asked a senior colleague this week how he would describe the Guardian's attitude towards the coverage of religious affairs, he said that, for as long as he could remember, it had been a mixture of neglect and disdain, persevered in despite the best efforts of a long succession of good religious affairs correspondents. Many readers would agree with that, or put it even stronger. </p> <p>Some readers - and journalists who work on the paper - believe we are routinely prepared to print or allow to be printed remarks that are offensive to Christians that we would not dream of directing at others, for example Jews or Muslims, because we know there would be uproar and that we would probably acknowledge such a reaction as justified. From time to time, I feel I should say, we do manage to offend Jews, Muslims, and many others. Do we really seem disinclined to develop the sensitivity, or objectivity, in matters of faith that the paper has struggled to achieve in dealing with race or homosexuality, or (the suggestion of one journalist) vegetarianism? That is how some readers see it. </p> <p>Most of the complaints come from Christians, perhaps because they form the majority of those readers who profess some religious faith, but we do not really know. We assume that our readership includes people of all faiths and none. But we have no idea how many of you adhere to this or that religion, or to a non-religious belief that you regard as at least equally valid. Everyone seems to have a different idea, with \"not many\" the popular notion. I think we might be surprised by the results of a survey. </p> <p>We are in a state of similar ignorance about the beliefs of the paper's own journalists - the people who make up the \"we\" I keep referring to - and perhaps we should not ask; but at least one reader thinks it might be relevant, making the point roughly like this - if your reporter is as godless as he (or she) appears to be, then no wonder he writes uncomprehendingly about other people's beliefs. The paper puts its faith, so to speak, in the idea that the professional attitudes of its journalists will prevail. Is that safe? One journalist said the general view of religious matters inside the Guardian was that they were not \"cool\". </p> <p>But to return to the complaints: \"I have been a loyal Guardian reader for over 20 years... I don't mind the paper giving constructive criticism of the Church, but there appears to be no attempt at balance.\" And from another reader: \"The constant mocking of religious faith and practice... is painful to most Christians.\" This correspondent says she has read the Guardian for her whole life and values its \"radical approach\", as many of her Christian friends do, but she adds:\"I would regard it as sinful to mock anyone's religion, be it Christian or other faiths.\" </p> <p>One reader, the wife of a Methodist minister, says she is giving up the Guardian because of what she perceives as its constant misrepresentation of \"what the churches are all about\". \"I can only guess at your intentions in rubbishing the churches but I would like to ask why you always ignore what actually goes on?\" She then lists the fund-raising activities for charities and relief organisations in which her church is involved. Others point to the role of churches in the inner cities and invite the question whether life would be poorer there without them. </p> <p>A frequent complaint is that the paper has an apparently insatiable appetite for the weirder aspects of faith and for the sexual activities of adherents and ministers, rather than for important issues actually touching people's spiritual lives. Journalists are seen, by some critics of our coverage, as pond skaters showing little or no awareness of, or interest in, the depths. </p> <p>Perhaps we are exaggerating. The Church of England recently conducted what might be called a negativity survey of newspaper coverage of its activities, searching for the words \"failing\" and \"decline\" or \"declining\". It concluded that the \"straightest\", or least negative, reporting, was in the Times and Guardian. </p> <p> What most correspondents, and others to whom I talked this week, now seem to recognise is the effort that is made to reflect the faiths represented in a multi-cultural society. We are not, as the religious affairs correspondent pointed out, a noticeboard for the Church of England. Indeed, we do not carry the leaders on religious values at Christmas or Easter that some papers still run, because we think we can safely assume that non-believers and believers in non-Christian faiths among our readers consider the Guardian to be just as much their paper as do the Christians. </p> <p>The editor says there is no reason why the scepticism applied in other areas of reporting should not be applied to the paper's coverage of religious affairs. Scepticism is not the same as scorn; although every now and again, some will insist, we seem closer to the latter. </p> <p>\u0095 Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning 020-7239 9589 between 11am and 5pm Monday to Friday.

      "bodyText": "When I asked a senior colleague this week how he would describe the Guardian's attitude towards the coverage of religious affairs, he said that, for as long as he could remember, it had been a mixture of neglect and disdain, persevered in despite the best efforts of a long succession of good religious affairs correspondents. Many readers would agree with that, or put it even stronger. Some readers - and journalists who work on the paper - believe we are routinely prepared to print or allow to be printed remarks that are offensive to Christians that we would not dream of directing at others, for example Jews or Muslims, because we know there would be uproar and that we would probably acknowledge such a reaction as justified. From time to time, I feel I should say, we do manage to offend Jews, Muslims, and many others. Do we really seem disinclined to develop the sensitivity, or objectivity, in matters of faith that the paper has struggled to achieve in dealing with race or homosexuality, or (the suggestion of one journalist) vegetarianism? That is how some readers see it. Most of the complaints come from Christians, perhaps because they form the majority of those readers who profess some religious faith, but we do not really know. We assume that our readership includes people of all faiths and none. But we have no idea how many of you adhere to this or that religion, or to a non-religious belief that you regard as at least equally valid. Everyone seems to have a different idea, with \"not many\" the popular notion. I think we might be surprised by the results of a survey. We are in a state of similar ignorance about the beliefs of the paper's own journalists - the people who make up the \"we\" I keep referring to - and perhaps we should not ask; but at least one reader thinks it might be relevant, making the point roughly like this - if your reporter is as godless as he (or she) appears to be, then no wonder he writes uncomprehendingly about other people's beliefs. The paper puts its faith, so to speak, in the idea that the professional attitudes of its journalists will prevail. Is that safe? One journalist said the general view of religious matters inside the Guardian was that they were not \"cool\". But to return to the complaints: \"I have been a loyal Guardian reader for over 20 years... I don't mind the paper giving constructive criticism of the Church, but there appears to be no attempt at balance.\" And from another reader: \"The constant mocking of religious faith and practice... is painful to most Christians.\" This correspondent says she has read the Guardian for her whole life and values its \"radical approach\", as many of her Christian friends do, but she adds:\"I would regard it as sinful to mock anyone's religion, be it Christian or other faiths.\" One reader, the wife of a Methodist minister, says she is giving up the Guardian because of what she perceives as its constant misrepresentation of \"what the churches are all about\". \"I can only guess at your intentions in rubbishing the churches but I would like to ask why you always ignore what actually goes on?\" She then lists the fund-raising activities for charities and relief organisations in which her church is involved. Others point to the role of churches in the inner cities and invite the question whether life would be poorer there without them. A frequent complaint is that the paper has an apparently insatiable appetite for the weirder aspects of faith and for the sexual activities of adherents and ministers, rather than for important issues actually touching people's spiritual lives. Journalists are seen, by some critics of our coverage, as pond skaters showing little or no awareness of, or interest in, the depths. Perhaps we are exaggerating. The Church of England recently conducted what might be called a negativity survey of newspaper coverage of its activities, searching for the words \"failing\" and \"decline\" or \"declining\". It concluded that the \"straightest\", or least negative, reporting, was in the Times and Guardian. What most correspondents, and others to whom I talked this week, now seem to recognise is the effort that is made to reflect the faiths represented in a multi-cultural society. We are not, as the religious affairs correspondent pointed out, a noticeboard for the Church of England. Indeed, we do not carry the leaders on religious values at Christmas or Easter that some papers still run, because we think we can safely assume that non-believers and believers in non-Christian faiths among our readers consider the Guardian to be just as much their paper as do the Christians. The editor says there is no reason why the scepticism applied in other areas of reporting should not be applied to the paper's coverage of religious affairs. Scepticism is not the same as scorn; although every now and again, some will insist, we seem closer to the latter. \u0095 Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning 020-7239 9589 between 11am and 5pm Monday to Friday.

The huge popularity of Lloyd Webber's musicals has never been matched by critical acclaim, which West Side Story had from the start. Most critics are dismissive about Lloyd Webber's musical abilities. Audiences feel his work is on in quite enough theatres already. The idea of Phantom at La Scala is shocking. Even to the composer. The proposal, Lloyd Webber said , came \"like a bolt from the blue\". He was flattered and delighted. \"It is a fantastic opportunity that I have never been able to enjoy in the musical theatre.\" </p> <p>Artistically, this is the core of the issue of whether the move is sacrilege. Like Mozart and Wagner, Lloyd Webber clearly writes something that can be described as \"music theatre\". But does that mean that anything which can be called music theatre should be performed in the opera house? Not surprisingly, Lloyd Webber says yes. \"I never thought there was any difference between opera and musicals that are through-written. Music theatre is music theatre.

Even at Bayreuth there are debates about whether works other than Wagner's might be performed there. </p> <p>It makes little sense to say that musicals ought never to be allowed in the opera house. We should be with Lloyd Webber on that. Musicals are music theatre, and in some cases more fun and more lasting in their appeal than unrevivable modern operas. The doors should be thrown open to new audiences. But the real test ought to be quality, not category. If the musical is good enough, put it on. You have to have the confidence to sort the bad from the good. And that's the problem about La Scala. Lloyd Webber acknowledged this. \"I agree with Duke Ellington,\" he said. \"There are only two kinds of music. Good music and bad music.\" </p> <p>My history teacher, David Bury, put it unforgettably. He was an opera fan, challenged by a group who assured him that the Rolling Stones were better than opera. \"If someone tells me that The Chocolate Soldier is as good as Don Giovanni,\" he thundered, \"that's not an opinion, that's rubbish.\"Is Phantom as good as Don Giovanni? The question answers itself. Is he worth La Scala's time and effort? I don't think so, but I could be wrong.</p>",

In the Soviet Union, you had to please Stalin. Under our present dispensation, you have to impress Carol Vorderman. For the latter (recently famed for thinking Shakespeare \"as dull as ditchwater\") is one of the \"trustees\" of the new National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (Nesta), which this week awarded to 13 \"amazing people\", including several writers, lump sums large enough to banish thoughts of the garret. </p> <p>Inevitably for a scheme devised, as it proclaims, \"to seek out creative people and innovative ideas\", Nesta is funded by the National Lottery, that \"tax upon stupidity\", as economist Adam Smith called it. Every year the interest from \u00a3200m of lottery money - about \u00a310m - is to be doled out in order to promote what the body's chief executive Jeremy Lewis calls \"the development of an artistic gift, or a new discovery, product or theory that improves the quality of life for everyone\". Nesta's largesse includes the financing of educational projects and innovative small businesses. It also funds \"fellowships\" worth up to \u00a375,000 to each fortunate paragon of creativity. </p> <p>Some of these beneficiaries are engaging-sounding inventors: a couple of scientists unable to squeeze from their universities the funding for idiosyncratic research; a self-educated inventor who devises special sets of wheels for moving difficult loads. There is also an assortment of writers and artists. There is the dancer and choreographer who has \u00a375,000 to visit Scottish Highland communi ties in order \"to develop and explore new, original approaches to creating and presenting dance and to examine how physical landscapes influence form, language and music in the evolution of culture and identity\". There is the maker of animated films who has \u00a363,000 to support her efforts to \"help business find new, creative approaches to problem-solving\". And, attracting most publicity, there is Tom Paulin. </p> <p>Paulin, Fellow in English at Hertford College, Oxford and the BBC's favourite literary critic, has been given \u00a375,000 to help him write an epic poem about the second world war. His poetry, he says, is usually \"written in time stolen from teaching, marking, administration, writing reviews and critical work\". Now he will be free from time-stealing. As will the other poet among the new fellows, Lavinia Greenlaw and the writer WG Sebald. </p> <p>Perhaps it is a recommendation of the scheme that Nesta identifies the candidates for its generosity so mysteriously. It has 100 \"nominators\" across the country - \"experts and leaders in a broad range of fields, who are in daily contact with new talent and thinking\". Each nominator gets to recommend two individuals. After you have done your nominating, you are replaced by a new nominator. (But who shall nominate the nominators?) This sounds promisingly odd - as if at least one or two of these nominators might volunteer some brilliant crank whose creativity was restrained only by his or her life of unremitting toil as a manual labourer. Yet the suspicion lingers that habitu\u00e9s of the arts media might nominate each other. </p> <p>Final choices from among the candidates are made by Nesta's trustees. This body has its quota of scientists and administrators, perhaps able to judge the plausibility of technological proposals. What about the writers? Authorship being a rivalrous profession, it might be just as well that there are no actual writers amongst the trustees (and maybe Carol Vorderman leaves well alone when poetry is discussed). Yet, however alive these worthies are to what writing is likeliest \"to cross conventional boundaries\" (their declared criterion), is their money (not that it is, of course, \"their\" money at all) ever going to allow \"the development of an artistic gift\" that would otherwise be suffocated? </p> <p>Doubters are likely to observe that writing is least in need of subsidy, being - unlike, say, staging operas - a pretty cheap occupation. You can hear this thought worrying the Nesta representatives as they explain why Tom Paulin needs all that cash. \"He will undertake an intense period of research and experimentation\" - limbering up before the lines begin to flow. Yet is this enough to say that Paulin, however harassed by the demanding students of Hertford College, Oxford and the phone calls from BBC producers, would not be able to write the mooted epic without his lottery windfall? </p> <p>In more expensive art forms, the argument for subsidy has usually been less embarrassed, though it has often met the counter-argument that state funding produces mediocrity by removing the responsibility to please. Recently, arguments have centred on lottery funding for British films, voiced most grumpily by veteran London Evening Standard film critic Alexander Walker. He would have it that, by easing the pressure to reach out to an audience, such funding merely encourages self-indulgence and sloppiness - and therefore produces bad films. </p> <p>Walker's scepticism is rooted in his observation that cinema is one of the most purely commercial of art forms. It lives or dies by its capacity to excite paying customers. Does the same argument work for writing? True Thatcherites always tell you about Shakespeare and Dickens, the greatest of talents being the biggest successes at the box-office. </p> <p>Most of Shakespeare's educated contemporaries, however, would have thought it far nobler to write for a patron than for the many-headed multitude. Best of all if that patron were the state, in the celestial person of the monarch. Then, in the 18th century, in Britain at least, the market took over. When Samuel Johnson said \"No man but a blockhead writes, except for money,\" he was embracing what would once have appalled any literary gentleman: the idea that commerce and literature should go hand in hand. </p> <p>Johnson despised the patron, defined in the dictionary that made his name as \"One who countenances, supports or protects. Commonly a wretch who supports with insolence, and is paid with flattery\". He lauded publishers (\"booksellers\" as they were called), the true friends of literature. He also, however, accepted a substantial pension from George III that greatly smoothed the last 20 years of his life. </p> <p>Johnson's celebration of writing for the market once seemed liber ating. Voltaire, like a procession of other enlightened travellers to London at the time, admired a country where anything could be published that might have enough readers to recoup the costs. Booksellers were large-minded men compared with princes and courtiers. Some recent historians, notably John Brewer in The Pleasures of the Imagination, have described how a democratic culture - of art, music, drama and literature - was only produced because, during the 18th century, patronage gave way to commerce. </p> <p>Yet patronage has not always been unproductive. Not only have toadying writers and artists make admirable literature and art (Spenser, Jonson, Dryden, among poets), once upon a time toadying itself - the art of the compliment, as it was thought of - could itself be a creative achievement. To get Nesta loot you have to apply via a form on the organisation's website. Once, you would have had to write a flattering or celebratory piece of verse. </p> <p>More awkwardly for cultural Thatcherites, what would William Blake have done without his handful of wealthy and eccentric patrons? The weirdness and exquisiteness of his laboriously etched, hand-coloured Songs of Innocence and Experience took them as far from commercial viability as is possible. He was a writer without any kind of public. </p> <p>Similarly, James Joyce's experimental, laboriously hewn fiction would hardly have been possible without the obstinate support of Harriet Shaw Weaver, who was his lifelong benefactor and who was convinced of his genius when only Ezra Pound and Joyce himself seemed to share the opinion. Indeed, Joyce seems to offer Nesta hope of doing a lasting service to literature. It may have been the rich and eccentric Weaver who got A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man published, but the composition of his masterpiece, Ulysses, was supported by what amounted to state patronage. In 1915, he received a grant from the Royal Literary Fund and, soon after, a grant from the civil list. It is a nice detail that this great Irish genius had the backing of the British state. </p> <p>Those who would have writers kept a little lean and hungry can argue that financial support also compromises and disarms. It is sometimes thought to have strangled Wordsworth's poetry. In 1813 Wordsworth was given a large sinecure by Lord Lonsdale, the local Tory grandee, and later admirers of his early verse (and his early radicalism) like Shelley and Browning were to judge that this was the end of him. We certainly no longer read most of what he produced during his last 37 years without financial anxieties but with establishment friends. </p> <p>Poets, of course, have a special problem. How many have ever made money from poetry? Alexander Pope, yes. Ted Hughes, but most of it posthumously. Not many others that spring to mind. With the small fortune that he made from translating Homer's Iliad into elegant English couplets for an elegant English readership, Pope had the privilege of mocking the scramble of versifiers for the favour of potential benefactors: \"Like the vile straw that's blown about the streets,/ The needy poet sticks to all he meets.\" </p> <p>Poets have always had to do day jobs (thus all that midnight scribbling). In the 20th century, as private incomes have become less common and life more expensive, they have often had to lead two separate lives. TS Eliot worked in Lloyds Bank every morning, until rich admirers clubbed together to rescue him, and Wallace Stevens was an executive with a Connecticut insurance company. Nowadays, while would-be novelists often survive by scribbling for newspapers and magazines, universites have become the public-spirited patrons of poets. American universities in particular buy them in (Geoffrey Hill, Derek Walcott) and bask in the reflected glory. Even famous Seamus has relied on the odd honorary professorship. Both sides benefit from this bargain. The academy looks as though it is treating literature as a living organism; the poet looks as though he is a thorough person of letters. And one imagines that Nobel prize-winners do not have to mark too many undergraduate essays. </p> <p>There seems little pattern to what we might now judge the \"worthwhile\" outlay of patrons in the past. Except that eccentric rich people with tastes somewhat out of kilter with their times (not Charles Saatchi, therefore) have been more likely to strike gold than committees or high-minded public bodies. Blake and Joyce needed patrons who were as odd as them. The great German lyric poet Rilke used to receive donations from an anonymous benefactor who was, in fact, Ludwig Wittgenstein - an ascetic man with a family fortune (and good taste). </p> <p>The other lesson is that money is best invested in those who, in Wordsworthian fashion, are capable of giving things up for the sake of their art. Retirement to an isolated cottage to produce only poetry might not be mandatory, but the Nesta trustees might consider making their grants conditional on the renunciation of media employment until the poetry is finished. </p> <p>\u0095 John Mullan is senior lecturer in English at University College, London.

There is the dancer and choreographer who has \u00a375,000 to visit Scottish Highland communi ties in order \"to develop and explore new, original approaches to creating and presenting dance and to examine how physical landscapes influence form, language and music in the evolution of culture and identity\". There is the maker of animated films who has \u00a363,000 to support her efforts to \"help business find new, creative approaches to problem-solving\". And, attracting most publicity, there is Tom Paulin. Paulin, Fellow in English at Hertford College, Oxford and the BBC's favourite literary critic, has been given \u00a375,000 to help him write an epic poem about the second world war. His poetry, he says, is usually \"written in time stolen from teaching, marking, administration, writing reviews and critical work\". Now he will be free from time-stealing. As will the other poet among the new fellows, Lavinia Greenlaw and the writer WG Sebald. Perhaps it is a recommendation of the scheme that Nesta identifies the candidates for its generosity so mysteriously. It has 100 \"nominators\" across the country - \"experts and leaders in a broad range of fields, who are in daily contact with new talent and thinking\". Each nominator gets to recommend two individuals. After you have done your nominating, you are replaced by a new nominator. (But who shall nominate the nominators?) This sounds promisingly odd - as if at least one or two of these nominators might volunteer some brilliant crank whose creativity was restrained only by his or her life of unremitting toil as a manual labourer. Yet the suspicion lingers that habitu\u00e9s of the arts media might nominate each other. Final choices from among the candidates are made by Nesta's trustees. This body has its quota of scientists and administrators, perhaps able to judge the plausibility of technological proposals. What about the writers? Authorship being a rivalrous profession, it might be just as well that there are no actual writers amongst the trustees (and maybe Carol Vorderman leaves well alone when poetry is discussed). Yet, however alive these worthies are to what writing is likeliest \"to cross conventional boundaries\" (their declared criterion), is their money (not that it is, of course, \"their\" money at all) ever going to allow \"the development of an artistic gift\" that would otherwise be suffocated? Doubters are likely to observe that writing is least in need of subsidy, being - unlike, say, staging operas - a pretty cheap occupation. You can hear this thought worrying the Nesta representatives as they explain why Tom Paulin needs all that cash. \"He will undertake an intense period of research and experimentation\" - limbering up before the lines begin to flow. Yet is this enough to say that Paulin, however harassed by the demanding students of Hertford College, Oxford and the phone calls from BBC producers, would not be able to write the mooted epic without his lottery windfall? In more expensive art forms, the argument for subsidy has usually been less embarrassed, though it has often met the counter-argument that state funding produces mediocrity by removing the responsibility to please. Recently, arguments have centred on lottery funding for British films, voiced most grumpily by veteran London Evening Standard film critic Alexander Walker. He would have it that, by easing the pressure to reach out to an audience, such funding merely encourages self-indulgence and sloppiness - and therefore produces bad films. Walker's scepticism is rooted in his observation that cinema is one of the most purely commercial of art forms. It lives or dies by its capacity to excite paying customers. Does the same argument work for writing? True Thatcherites always tell you about Shakespeare and Dickens, the greatest of talents being the biggest successes at the box-office. Most of Shakespeare's educated contemporaries, however, would have thought it far nobler to write for a patron than for the many-headed multitude. Best of all if that patron were the state, in the celestial person of the monarch. Then, in the 18th century, in Britain at least, the market took over. When Samuel Johnson said \"No man but a blockhead writes, except for money,\" he was embracing what would once have appalled any literary gentleman: the idea that commerce and literature should go hand in hand. Johnson despised the patron, defined in the dictionary that made his name as \"One who countenances, supports or protects. Commonly a wretch who supports with insolence, and is paid with flattery\". He lauded publishers (\"booksellers\" as they were called), the true friends of literature. He also, however, accepted a substantial pension from George III that greatly smoothed the last 20 years of his life. Johnson's celebration of writing for the market once seemed liber ating. Voltaire, like a procession of other enlightened travellers to London at the time, admired a country where anything could be published that might have enough readers to recoup the costs. Booksellers were large-minded men compared with princes and courtiers. Some recent historians, notably John Brewer in The Pleasures of the Imagination, have described how a democratic culture - of art, music, drama and literature - was only produced because, during the 18th century, patronage gave way to commerce. Yet patronage has not always been unproductive. Not only have toadying writers and artists make admirable literature and art (Spenser, Jonson, Dryden, among poets), once upon a time toadying itself - the art of the compliment, as it was thought of - could itself be a creative achievement. To get Nesta loot you have to apply via a form on the organisation's website. Once, you would have had to write a flattering or celebratory piece of verse. More awkwardly for cultural Thatcherites, what would William Blake have done without his handful of wealthy and eccentric patrons? The weirdness and exquisiteness of his laboriously etched, hand-coloured Songs of Innocence and Experience took them as far from commercial viability as is possible. He was a writer without any kind of public. Similarly, James Joyce's experimental, laboriously hewn fiction would hardly have been possible without the obstinate support of Harriet Shaw Weaver, who was his lifelong benefactor and who was convinced of his genius when only Ezra Pound and Joyce himself seemed to share the opinion. Indeed, Joyce seems to offer Nesta hope of doing a lasting service to literature. It may have been the rich and eccentric Weaver who got A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man published, but the composition of his masterpiece, Ulysses, was supported by what amounted to state patronage. In 1915, he received a grant from the Royal Literary Fund and, soon after, a grant from the civil list. It is a nice detail that this great Irish genius had the backing of the British state. Those who would have writers kept a little lean and hungry can argue that financial support also compromises and disarms. It is sometimes thought to have strangled Wordsworth's poetry. In 1813 Wordsworth was given a large sinecure by Lord Lonsdale, the local Tory grandee, and later admirers of his early verse (and his early radicalism) like Shelley and Browning were to judge that this was the end of him. We certainly no longer read most of what he produced during his last 37 years without financial anxieties but with establishment friends. Poets, of course, have a special problem. How many have ever made money from poetry? Alexander Pope, yes. Ted Hughes, but most of it posthumously. Not many others that spring to mind. With the small fortune that he made from translating Homer's Iliad into elegant English couplets for an elegant English readership, Pope had the privilege of mocking the scramble of versifiers for the favour of potential benefactors: \"Like the vile straw that's blown about the streets,/ The needy poet sticks to all he meets.\" Poets have always had to do day jobs (thus all that midnight scribbling). In the 20th century, as private incomes have become less common and life more expensive, they have often had to lead two separate lives. TS Eliot worked in Lloyds Bank every morning, until rich admirers clubbed together to rescue him, and Wallace Stevens was an executive with a Connecticut insurance company. Nowadays, while would-be novelists often survive by scribbling for newspapers and magazines, universites have become the public-spirited patrons of poets. American universities in particular buy them in (Geoffrey Hill, Derek Walcott) and bask in the reflected glory. Even famous Seamus has relied on the odd honorary professorship. Both sides benefit from this bargain. The academy looks as though it is treating literature as a living organism; the poet looks as though he is a thorough person of letters. And one imagines that Nobel prize-winners do not have to mark too many undergraduate essays. There seems little pattern to what we might now judge the \"worthwhile\" outlay of patrons in the past. Except that eccentric rich people with tastes somewhat out of kilter with their times (not Charles Saatchi, therefore) have been more likely to strike gold than committees or high-minded public bodies. Blake and Joyce needed patrons who were as odd as them. The great German lyric poet Rilke used to receive donations from an anonymous benefactor who was, in fact, Ludwig Wittgenstein - an ascetic man with a family fortune (and good taste). The other lesson is that money is best invested in those who, in Wordsworthian fashion, are capable of giving things up for the sake of their art. Retirement to an isolated cottage to produce only poetry might not be mandatory, but the Nesta trustees might consider making their grants conditional on the renunciation of media employment until the poetry is finished. \u0095 John Mullan is senior lecturer in English at University College, London.

When he knew his death was imminent, he decided that there should be no funeral, but a party to celebrate his \"outstanding weaknesses\". I am not sure quite what he thought they were. A fondness for drink is not a terrible thing, though it may have contributed to his rather frightening flashes of temper. \"Fuck you,\" he kept shouting at me during one of our last dinners together when he thought I was being patronising. Actually, he had fewer weaknesses and more virtues than most people, since he was essentially kind and generous, and his anger was always short-lived.

These were printed on the invitation, and very idiosyncratic they were, too, reflecting both some of his unfathomable prejudices and the deep seriousness with which he approached all matters, even such relatively unimportant ones as what to eat and drink. On the drink to be served at the party, for example, Bruce wrote the following instructions, couched in strange, almost biblical language: \"I would favour the Macallan Whisky though there are those who favour the flavour of peat more than I do. Beer should not be overlooked as should neither be wine. Ch\u00e2teau Musar is highly potable, and the best Champenoise should be freely available.

This is the only drink that would not be paid for by the Committee For The Celebration Of Bruce Bernard's Outstanding Weaknesses.\" </p> <p>I don't know why he felt such antipathy towards champagne. Perhaps he disliked bubbliness of any kind, in both drink and people. He certainly couldn't be described as bubbly himself. Indeed, despite his central amiability, he verged in manner on the lugubrious. His sense of humour was considerable, but it was of the W C Fields variety. Possibly, he shrank from the thought of being associated even after death with the kind of jollity that champagne implies. The Committee followed his instructions to the letter, except, so far as I could see, in the provision of champagne for people to purchase (though some bottles may have been hidden away somewhere). Maybe it decided, rightly, that it would be doing Bruce a favour by excluding champagne from the premises altogether, for he clearly would have begrudged both its presence and the presence of those who insisted on drinking it. </p> <p>On the food, Bruce wrote: \"If I were there, I would especially like cold lamb cooked to a dull pink throughout - also the best rare beef. Potato salad with the finest potatoes and dressing would seem imperative. I may well, it will be appreciated, never see another potato again, and Branston Pickle seems to me a very good thing.\" Bruce was, in fact, something of a gourmet, and an excellent cook himself. He made excellent Italian dishes, among other things. But he never lost his affection for the basic English food that he had presumably consumed in countless pubs throughout his life, perhaps especially in his youth when he toured England as a stagehand. Anyway, it was to this kind of food that his thoughts turned in his final days. Once again, the Committee acquitted itself with distinction. Cold meats were served in little buns, and potato salad in transparent plastic mugs. </p> <p> The party was held last Saturday in large domed gallery in Bayswater. It was a boiling-hot day, and the room was crowded with Bruce's friends. I was surprised by how few of them I had met. Those that I knew were mostly journalists or Bruce's relations, but they were in a small minority. There were members of the art world there, but most of the guests seemed to be veterans of the old bohemian Soho in which Bruce spent much of his adult life. They had that special camaraderie of war veterans who know that nobody but them can understand the experiences they have shared. </p> <p>A small reproduction of a Lucian Freud portrait of Bruce hung on a wall at the end of the room, a bit like the icon of a cult leader or Communist dictator. Silence was called for the playing of a Bach chaconne that went on for 10 minutes, and when it ended the heavens opened and released torrents of rain that mercifully relieved the heat. It was a glorious salute to a great man. Bruce may never see another potato, but we, for sure, will never see another him.</p>",

      "bodyText": "'If you really want to know, they chased me.\" Ex-Spouse is defending his extra-maritals. Quietly, because his aunt is in the next room. \"Elaine chased me. And if my memory serves me right, about 30 years ago, even you chased me.\" Below-the-belt, that. But I'm afraid it's probably true. \"Dulcie!\" Aunt rushes in looking anxious. \"Something's wrrrong, dearr! When I lean forward, I get this pain between my shoulder blades and it goes shooting up my throat into the rrroof of my mouth.\" \"It's only heartburn,\" comments Ex-Spouse sourly. He hates it when there's another hypochondriac in the house. \"Just don't lean forward.\" Heartburn. Don't lean forward, and don't look back. I chased him! It's true! I went all the way to Oxford on the bus, because they'd just closed the Oxford-Cambridge line (Marsh Gibbon-Lords Bridge). I asked him if he'd like to play Jacques in my production of As You Like It. And he's been playing Jacques ever since and sometimes I like it and sometimes I don't. It was his dark, Gothic looks that betrayed me. Emily Bronte's got a lot to answer for. \"But I want to lean forrward, dearr ! I wanted to plant a few dahlias in Dulcie's garrrden, to give it a bit of colourr! \" Make excuse and run off to bathroom, incandescent with rage. Never mind Gordon's infidelities, it's his aunt's horticultural impertinence that I can't stand. A bit of colour, indeed! Never trust a nation who invented the tartan. I am going into my Oriental phase, you see. Even as I sit on the loo, I am irritated by our violently colourful bath towels. If only they were all a nice, quiet white. But towels last forever. You're stuck with the same old blue-and-yellow towels you bought back in 1975, just as you're stuck with the same old blue-and-yellow husband. Open bathroom window and admire the as-yet unlandscaped back garden. It is dominated by a vast bullying opportunist rose that vaults everywhere putting down suckers. I'm hoping to sell it to Nato - along with Aunt Elspeth's latest cheese, produced from the milk of surly goats who haunt the crags of the north. To be honest, I think she's lucky to have escaped with only heartburn. I can still smell it festering in the fridge, even when I'm upstairs lying in bed with the duvet over my head. \"Mum? D'ya like my new look?\" Harriet appears decked out in a range of black fetishistic clothes acquired from Camden Market. She is in the full flush of Rocky Hollywood. She adorns herself with Gothic crosses, straps, and instruments of torture. She is now a Museum Of The Inquisition. I hesitate, then deliver the required compliment. \"You don't like it!\" Her eyes flare in their sooty sockets. \"You're so, like, tight! An' you told me you were Gothic yourself in the 70s!\" Assure Harriet that she is the most beautiful person on the planet, and retreat to the back garden with secateurs. My plan is to get rid of everything and replace it with gravel, bamboo and railway sleepers (Lord's Bridge-Marsh Gibbon). I shall sit in the house and look out admiringly at its unchanging Zen simplicity. Don't even mention bloody dahlias. Perhaps the aunt would be satisfied with a colourful window-box under the stairs. Ex-Spouse comes out of the house. \"Can I help you?\" he asks. I don't like the word gobsmacked but sometimes it is unavoidable. Hand him the secateurs and ask him to get rid of enormous thicket of rampant rose. With any luck, he will get pricked quite a lot. Quite appropriate, really. Go back indoors and walk straight into what he came out to avoid - Aunt and Harriet having words. \"I only said that a skirt that shorrrt might give the wrong kind of people the wrrrong ideas, dearr .\" \"I've got a right to wear what I like!

Art Nouveau embraced many different materials, but glass was at the epicentre of the new movement. Tiffany, with his lustrous, iridescent vessels, and Gall\u00e9, with his sculptural, multi-layered cameo glass, released its potential and acted as catalysts for a century of creativity to come. At this date, domestic glass was almost invariably decorated, and techniques such as cutting, engraving, etching and gilding were widely used. After the first world war, however, and particularly after the stock market crash of 1929, the market for lavish ornamental glass diminished, and during the 30s there was a much more pragmatic approach to design.</p> <p>This was when Sweden emerged as a glass superpower, spearheaded by the inspirational firm of Orrefors. Orrefors recruited leading artists and sculptors - first Edward Hald and Simon Gate, then Edvin \u00d6hrstr\u00f6m and Vicke Lindstrand - who, as well as designing stunning art glass, created modestly priced, plain, elegant tableware for the home. The influence of Orrefors was soon felt throughout the Swedish glass industry, inspiring rival firms such as Kosta to great heights as well. Within a short time, cross- fertilisation had spread to neighbouring Denmark and Finland, paving the way for a second wave of creativity, even broader and more powerful than the first, after the second world war. In the 50s and 60s, the cool, curvilinear Scandinavian Modern style triumphed throughout Europe and the United States, and no self-respecting contemporary home was complete without its Orrefors vase, Iitala tumblers or Holmegaard bowl.</p> <p>Sweden was one of the few countries whose glassworks continued operating during the second world war. When hostilities were finally over, the whole geography of the glass industry had changed forever. The most radical restructuring took place in Czechoslovakia, where the glass industry was nationalised in 1948. This resulted in hundreds of previously independent factories and decorating workshops being placed under the control of a handful of centrally administered national corporations.</p> <p>Rather than stifling creativity, however, nationalisation triggered a renaissance in Czech glass design. The state-run system gave designers such as Stanislav Libensky and Pavel Hlava the freedom to develop their talents as glass artists, and they responded by creating some of the most mesmerising glass vessels and sculptures ever seen. When large-scale displays of Czech art glass were mounted at the Brussels Expo of 1958 and the Montreal Expo of 1967, they transfixed the world.</p> <p>The explosion of creativity in Italy during the 50s probably had as much to do with the country's liberation from fascism as the ending of the war.

      "body": "<p>A novelist wrote a wonderful sentence about a young person's discovery of wine: 'She loved the shapes of bottles and of course the romantic names and the pictures of the pretty manor houses on the labels, and she loved the link with rivers and hillsides and climates and hot years, and the range of learning and experiment afforded by wine's infinite variety; but what she loved more than these was the taste - of peach and earth and honeysuckle and raspberries and spice and cedarwood and pebbles and truffles and tobacco leaf; and the happiness, the quiet ecstasy that spreads through heart and limbs and mind.' </p> <p>The first reader whose card or letter identifies the novel and its author before the last day of June, I will take to lunch at Le Gavroche in London. The six runners-up, I'll send signed copies of my next book. I am feeling ecstatic today. </p> <p>There is a quiet ecstasy about drinking good wine. There is a quiet ecstasy, I find, about tracking down good wine. Many people, especially those professionally employed in the wine trade, find it faintly incredible that I should discover such pleasure in supermarkets' wine shelves, but there it is, I do. (It is not an ecstasy which necessarily spreads, quietly or with brass trumpets, to other shelves but that's another story.) </p> <p>Safeway now. The very name of this supermarket deadens the arteries that connect to the ecstatic channels, but it has some interesting and individual wines and this week's column is devoted solely to wines from it. Let me open with the most absurd: the one you can, until the 28th of this month, get past the checkout for \u00a32.79. This is Caballo de Plata Bonarda/ Barbera 1999, a joyously rich red from Argentina. Of course it is simple. Of course it is unpretentious. Of course it is forward, ripe and fruity.

      "bodyText": "A novelist wrote a wonderful sentence about a young person's discovery of wine: 'She loved the shapes of bottles and of course the romantic names and the pictures of the pretty manor houses on the labels, and she loved the link with rivers and hillsides and climates and hot years, and the range of learning and experiment afforded by wine's infinite variety; but what she loved more than these was the taste - of peach and earth and honeysuckle and raspberries and spice and cedarwood and pebbles and truffles and tobacco leaf; and the happiness, the quiet ecstasy that spreads through heart and limbs and mind.' The first reader whose card or letter identifies the novel and its author before the last day of June, I will take to lunch at Le Gavroche in London. The six runners-up, I'll send signed copies of my next book. I am feeling ecstatic today. There is a quiet ecstasy about drinking good wine. There is a quiet ecstasy, I find, about tracking down good wine. Many people, especially those professionally employed in the wine trade, find it faintly incredible that I should discover such pleasure in supermarkets' wine shelves, but there it is, I do. (It is not an ecstasy which necessarily spreads, quietly or with brass trumpets, to other shelves but that's another story.) Safeway now. The very name of this supermarket deadens the arteries that connect to the ecstatic channels, but it has some interesting and individual wines and this week's column is devoted solely to wines from it. Let me open with the most absurd: the one you can, until the 28th of this month, get past the checkout for \u00a32.79. This is Caballo de Plata Bonarda/ Barbera 1999, a joyously rich red from Argentina. Of course it is simple. Of course it is unpretentious. Of course it is forward, ripe and fruity. But if you have spicy food on the table or waiting for you at the BYO Indian restaurant around the corner, then this wine is a marvellous bargain. It rates 15 points out of 20.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If gardener and writer Paul Williams was a plant, he'd be a self-seeded exotic - rare and rooted in an unlikely place in some hidden part of the garden, upstaged by the showier, more familiar plants clambering over each other closer to the house.</p> <p>Williams is now considered one of the most innovative gardeners around, who built his reputation at Bourton House, in Gloucestershire, where he was head gardener for 15 years. He doesn't own a television set, let alone want to appear on it, which no doubt accounts for the low public profile. But though he's a plantsman more than a writer (he says), he has an easy style in the books he's written.</p> <p>Born and bred in Staffordshire, Williams's passion for plants began on a hitchhiking jaunt to the Pyrenees, where he became interested in wild flowers. After a stint cutting grass for the council, where he met his wife, Barbara, his career got off to a start of sorts: \"The head gardener at the local estate was retiring so I put in for the job and got it,\" he recalls. \"It was a crap job, crap house - it leaked and everything - but I went to Edgbaston College down the road on day-release. There were two lecturers there who were just fabulous guys. It's the plants that turn you on at the end of the day, and these two very much had an interest in plants.\"</p> <p>From there, he went on to do a landscape technology course at Pershore Agricultural College, including a sandwich year at Bourton House, which in turn led to his long involvement as head gardener. At Bourton, Williams had a free hand and the garden he created put the place on the map, attracting thousands of visitors each year. However, relations with the owners soured and, recently, Williams quit, leaving behind the plant collection he had built from scratch.</p> <p>He and Barbara still live just a few miles away in Blockley, with their back garden packed with plants, many of which appear in his book, Creative Containers (Conran Octopus). Williams's own containers include finds from the local scrapyard: a heat exchanger wrapped in wire, planted up with spiky grass, and a metal ball-cock with holes cut into it, through which the green rosettes of sempervivums peek.</p> <p>The book is a good example of Williams's \"try anything\" approach. No plants are banned because they are either too fashionable or too common: petunias are suddenly covetable when they are a soft yellow, called 'Brass Band' and are planted up in old olive-oil containers.

      "bodyText": "If gardener and writer Paul Williams was a plant, he'd be a self-seeded exotic - rare and rooted in an unlikely place in some hidden part of the garden, upstaged by the showier, more familiar plants clambering over each other closer to the house. Williams is now considered one of the most innovative gardeners around, who built his reputation at Bourton House, in Gloucestershire, where he was head gardener for 15 years. He doesn't own a television set, let alone want to appear on it, which no doubt accounts for the low public profile. But though he's a plantsman more than a writer (he says), he has an easy style in the books he's written. Born and bred in Staffordshire, Williams's passion for plants began on a hitchhiking jaunt to the Pyrenees, where he became interested in wild flowers. After a stint cutting grass for the council, where he met his wife, Barbara, his career got off to a start of sorts: \"The head gardener at the local estate was retiring so I put in for the job and got it,\" he recalls. \"It was a crap job, crap house - it leaked and everything - but I went to Edgbaston College down the road on day-release. There were two lecturers there who were just fabulous guys. It's the plants that turn you on at the end of the day, and these two very much had an interest in plants.\" From there, he went on to do a landscape technology course at Pershore Agricultural College, including a sandwich year at Bourton House, which in turn led to his long involvement as head gardener. At Bourton, Williams had a free hand and the garden he created put the place on the map, attracting thousands of visitors each year. However, relations with the owners soured and, recently, Williams quit, leaving behind the plant collection he had built from scratch. He and Barbara still live just a few miles away in Blockley, with their back garden packed with plants, many of which appear in his book, Creative Containers (Conran Octopus). Williams's own containers include finds from the local scrapyard: a heat exchanger wrapped in wire, planted up with spiky grass, and a metal ball-cock with holes cut into it, through which the green rosettes of sempervivums peek. The book is a good example of Williams's \"try anything\" approach. No plants are banned because they are either too fashionable or too common: petunias are suddenly covetable when they are a soft yellow, called 'Brass Band' and are planted up in old olive-oil containers. Hanging baskets shake off their naff image and instead look stylish and low-key when they're woven from vine prunings and transformed into balls of ivy hanging from the branch of a tree. Despite thinking of himself as a gardener rather than writer, Williams has just produced his third book, Garden Colour Palette. In this, the reader can mix and match different colour schemes via a kind of identikit format. And, if you're still not sure, there's also advice on what plants go well together. What really excites him at the moment? \"I'm still on a big plant kick, you know, giant foliage and jungly stuff: the big inulas, and the tropical stuff, the cannas. Herbaceous aralias. If you want to grow something big and jungly, grow them.

The low cost and easy preparation of gelatine-based dishes secured its place in the domestic kitchen of yesteryear: sugar-soaked fruit aside, it was used to glaze many a boiled egg canap\u00e9 and to dress up a wild salmon like a strumpet in an attempt to jolly along the buffet from hell. There must have been little thought as to how these dishes actually tasted, however, and most people's memories of such food are on a par with their distressed memories of school dinners - sheer torture.</p> <p>But the realisation that these bouncing jellies were made by human hands - and, worse, that the unholy terrors of too many a sideboard were intended to look and taste like that - gives ample cause for thought. The simple truth is that cooks over-boinged their jellied food to make the serving of it all the easier, without regard as to whether it was edible or not.</p> <p>However, it need not be so, for gelatine is also an essential ingredient in those wonderful savoury mousses that make such excellent use of the leftovers of ham or poached fish. When spread upon good bread, these make a simple and delicious lunch; and, when eaten thus, you realise that food made with gelatine need not bounce like Tigger.</p> <p>Similarly, a jelly made from poached calves' feet, say, lightly flavoured with some fresh tarragon leaves, makes a delightful accompaniment to a terrine or poached chicken, the chicken cooked slowly in the same pot as the veal. Even better, there really is very little work involved in the preparation, although your judgment of the cooking must be good, and the cooking times adhered to with rigour. The dividends are well worth the extra effort. The same calves' feet jelly with a poached egg set inside, meanwhile, will beget the justly-famed dish of lore, oeuf en gel\u00e9e . Alternatively, use the gelatine to set some roughly-chopped ham, an armful of fresh parsley and a little garlic, and you'll have created the equally lauded jambon persill\u00e9 .</p> <p>None of which makes up for the fact that gelatine, be it leaf or powder, is a most unappealing substance, being manufactured by boiling up bits and bobs of dead animals. But there are some entirely natural gelling agents out there. At the top end of the market, there is isinglass, made from the swim bladders of sturgeon, but - like the roe of that same fish - it is a very expensive ingredient indeed. Gelatine also hails from cod, carp and ling, among other fish, though the quality is not so fine as isinglass. The very finest natural gelatine, so legend has it, can set a hundred times its weight in liquid, after all.</p> <p>There is also natural gelatine to be found in seaweed, which is rather less rarified. In Japan, there is agar-agar, but this is a habitu\u00e9 of laboratories rather than kitchens, as it does not melt at blood temperature, which is a vital requirement if it is to be put to culinary use. For the latter practice, you need to forage along the rocky coastlines of Ireland, the Hebrides and Brittany for carrageen (also known as pearl moss), from which gelatine is also procured - take, for example, the curious and wonderful recipe for carrageen pudding in Fergus Henderson's estimable Nose To Tail Eating.</p> <p>So, if you, too, cannot find a redeeming quality in gelatine, and if its absence from your larder does not make the heart grow fonder, remember those endearing little mousses and the fact that a properly made jelly can be quite irresistible.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> Cucumber mousse</b></p> <p>I particularly like this served alongside a baked fish that has been left to cool down, some boiled new potatoes and a little mustard mixed with sugar, oil, vinegar and dill. With an elegant bottle of chilled white wine, this makes a very pleasant repast indeed.</p> <p><b> 1 medium-sized cucumber</b></p> <p><b>25g sea salt</b></p> <p><b>3 tbsp top-notch white-wine vinegar</b></p> <p><b>3 gelatine leaves</b></p> <p><b>6 spring onions</b></p> <p><b>1 small bunch chives</b></p> <p><b>300ml good double cream</b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp chopped parsley</b></p> <p><b>500g curd cheese</b></p> <p><b>A fully-charged pepper mill</b></p> <p>Peel the cucumber, cut it in half lengthways, remove the seeds and chop into a small dice. Mix the salt and vinegar in a large bowl, and stir in the cucumber. Tip into a colander, set a plate atop to compress, and leave to drip for an hour or so. Put the cucumber into a linen cloth and squeeze dry.</p> <p>Place the leaves of gelatine in a bowl of cold water to soften. Trim, clean and finely slice the spring onions and chives, and place in a bowl with the chopped parsley. Put the cheese in a bowl and break it up, then stir in the cream.</p> <p>Remove the gelatine from the water and squeeze lightly. Put it in a small saucepan with any residual water and warm over a low heat until it becomes liquid, taking care that it does not boil. Stir the gelatine into the cream and cheese, then add the cucumber, chopped herbs and plenty of pepper. Taste to check if more vinegar or salt is required, then tip into a lightly-oiled bowl. Place in the fridge and leave overnight.</p> <p><b> Ham mousse</b></p> <p>A very good way to use up the remains of a ham or a hock.</p> <p><b> 340g cooked lean ham</b></p> <p><b>3 gelatine leaves</b></p> <p><b>140ml hot water</b></p> <p><b>2 egg whites</b></p> <p><b>290ml double cream</b></p> <p><b>A fully-charged pepper mill</b></p> <p>In a bowl, place the gelatine in the hot water and set this over a pan of simmering hot water. When the gelatine has fully dissolved, put it to one side to cool. Chop the ham very finely, and pound it to a paste - this may be done in a food processor, although the end-result is not quite as good as that prepared by hand.</p> <p>Pour the cooled gelatine through a fine sieve, and mix into the ham paste. Lightly whip the cream until it just holds a shape, then fold into the ham mix. Add a generous grind of pepper, and stir. Cover the bowl, and place in the fridge for half-an-hour or so.</p> <p>Whip the egg whites into stiff peaks, fold these into the mixture, then decant the lot into a handsome serving bowl. Chill for a few hours before serving.</p> <p><b> Blueberry jelly</b></p> <p>Blueberry and vanilla is a match made in heaven.</p> <p><b> 4 gelatine leaves</b></p> <p><b>2 vanilla pods</b></p> <p><b>500g blueberries</b></p> <p><b>200ml light dessert wine</b></p> <p><b>220g caster sugar</b></p> <p>Put the gelatine into plenty of cold water for five to 10 minutes, until completely softened. Split the vanilla pods lengthways, and scrape out the seeds.</p> <p>Put the blueberries, vanilla seeds and pods, wine and sugar into a heavy-bottomed pot. Over a gentle heat, bring the pot to a simmer and cook for five to 10 minutes. Push the blueberry mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or mouli.</p> <p>Squeeze the gelatine leaves, and put them in a small pan with a few tablespoons of the blueberry pur\u00e9e. Warm gently until the leaves are fully melted, then add to the blueberry mix and stir to incorporate. Wet a mould (or moulds), tip off any excess water, then pour in the liquid jelly and refrigerate overnight.</p> <p><b> Chocolate bavarois</b></p> <p>Have everything to hand when putting together a Bavarois, for the moment the components are assembled the mixture will start to stiffen almost at once.</p> <p><b> 3 gelatine leaves</b></p> <p><b>5 very fresh eggs</b></p> <p><b>160g caster sugar</b></p> <p><b>2 tsp cornflour</b></p> <p><b>430ml milk</b></p> <p><b>3oz dark, bitter chocolate</b></p> <p><b>140ml strong coffee</b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp caster sugar</b></p> <p><b>140ml double cream</b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp dark rum</b></p> <p><b>2 tsp vanilla extract</b></p> <p>Put the gelatine in plenty of cold water to soften. Separate the eggs, put the whites in a bowl and pop them in the fridge. Mix together the egg yolks and sugar, then stir in the cornflour. Put the milk and chocolate in a pan, and place over a medium heat. Squeeze the excess water from the gelatine, and put in a separate pan, along with the coffee. When the chocolate has fully melted into the milk and the mixture is quite smooth, pour it over the egg-yolk mix, stirring all the while. Tip the resulting chocolate custard back in the pan, place over a low heat and, stirring constantly, cook until thickened. Warm the coffee and gelatine until completely liquid, then stir it into the chocolate custard.</p> <p>Beat the egg whites until they develop soft peaks, then add a spoonful of caster sugar and beat again until a glossy sheen is attained. Fold the whites into the hot chocolate mix, and set aside to cool. Carefully fold the mixture from time to time, to prevent it from splitting. Refrigerate if necessary, but do not allow to set. Rinse the mould (or moulds) with cold water and drain off any excess. Beat the double cream until lightly whipped and just holding a shape. Tip the rum and vanilla into the chocolate mix, fold in the cream, then decant into the mould. Place in the fridge and leave overnight to set.</p> <p>To serve, dip the mould into a bowl of very hot water for just a few seconds, then run a hot thin knife around the edge of the Bavarois and invert on to a chilled plate. This is very good with ginger-flavoured custard</p> <p>\u0095 Jeremy Lee is chef at the Blue Print Cafe, London SE1.</p>",

Trim, clean and finely slice the spring onions and chives, and place in a bowl with the chopped parsley. Put the cheese in a bowl and break it up, then stir in the cream. Remove the gelatine from the water and squeeze lightly. Put it in a small saucepan with any residual water and warm over a low heat until it becomes liquid, taking care that it does not boil. Stir the gelatine into the cream and cheese, then add the cucumber, chopped herbs and plenty of pepper. Taste to check if more vinegar or salt is required, then tip into a lightly-oiled bowl. Place in the fridge and leave overnight. Ham mousse A very good way to use up the remains of a ham or a hock. 340g cooked lean ham 3 gelatine leaves 140ml hot water 2 egg whites 290ml double cream A fully-charged pepper mill In a bowl, place the gelatine in the hot water and set this over a pan of simmering hot water. When the gelatine has fully dissolved, put it to one side to cool. Chop the ham very finely, and pound it to a paste - this may be done in a food processor, although the end-result is not quite as good as that prepared by hand. Pour the cooled gelatine through a fine sieve, and mix into the ham paste. Lightly whip the cream until it just holds a shape, then fold into the ham mix. Add a generous grind of pepper, and stir. Cover the bowl, and place in the fridge for half-an-hour or so. Whip the egg whites into stiff peaks, fold these into the mixture, then decant the lot into a handsome serving bowl. Chill for a few hours before serving. Blueberry jelly Blueberry and vanilla is a match made in heaven. 4 gelatine leaves 2 vanilla pods 500g blueberries 200ml light dessert wine 220g caster sugar Put the gelatine into plenty of cold water for five to 10 minutes, until completely softened. Split the vanilla pods lengthways, and scrape out the seeds. Put the blueberries, vanilla seeds and pods, wine and sugar into a heavy-bottomed pot. Over a gentle heat, bring the pot to a simmer and cook for five to 10 minutes. Push the blueberry mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or mouli. Squeeze the gelatine leaves, and put them in a small pan with a few tablespoons of the blueberry pur\u00e9e. Warm gently until the leaves are fully melted, then add to the blueberry mix and stir to incorporate. Wet a mould (or moulds), tip off any excess water, then pour in the liquid jelly and refrigerate overnight. Chocolate bavarois Have everything to hand when putting together a Bavarois, for the moment the components are assembled the mixture will start to stiffen almost at once. 3 gelatine leaves 5 very fresh eggs 160g caster sugar 2 tsp cornflour 430ml milk 3oz dark, bitter chocolate 140ml strong coffee 1 tbsp caster sugar 140ml double cream 2 tbsp dark rum 2 tsp vanilla extract Put the gelatine in plenty of cold water to soften. Separate the eggs, put the whites in a bowl and pop them in the fridge. Mix together the egg yolks and sugar, then stir in the cornflour. Put the milk and chocolate in a pan, and place over a medium heat. Squeeze the excess water from the gelatine, and put in a separate pan, along with the coffee. When the chocolate has fully melted into the milk and the mixture is quite smooth, pour it over the egg-yolk mix, stirring all the while. Tip the resulting chocolate custard back in the pan, place over a low heat and, stirring constantly, cook until thickened. Warm the coffee and gelatine until completely liquid, then stir it into the chocolate custard. Beat the egg whites until they develop soft peaks, then add a spoonful of caster sugar and beat again until a glossy sheen is attained. Fold the whites into the hot chocolate mix, and set aside to cool. Carefully fold the mixture from time to time, to prevent it from splitting. Refrigerate if necessary, but do not allow to set. Rinse the mould (or moulds) with cold water and drain off any excess. Beat the double cream until lightly whipped and just holding a shape. Tip the rum and vanilla into the chocolate mix, fold in the cream, then decant into the mould. Place in the fridge and leave overnight to set. To serve, dip the mould into a bowl of very hot water for just a few seconds, then run a hot thin knife around the edge of the Bavarois and invert on to a chilled plate. This is very good with ginger-flavoured custard \u0095 Jeremy Lee is chef at the Blue Print Cafe, London SE1.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Race is once more on the agenda in British politics, and at least one party on the far right is confidently hoping to capitalise on it. From his fastness in the Welsh hills, Nick Griffin, elected head of the British National Party (BNP) last autumn, is plotting to revive the fortunes of the most reviled party in Britain with a new strategy that he hopes will suit the temper of the times. </p> <p>Gone are the swastikas, the shaved heads, the marches with Union Jacks fluttering. Instead, there is the stream of innocuous-sounding front organisations, the South West Family Defence Organisation, the British Countryman, Save Our Sterling, promoted in smooth fireside chats over the internet. Griffin wants to cast off the Nazi-worshipping past of his predecessors, he wants to remould the riff-raff, the social misfits, the racists, the anti-Semites, the skinheads, street thugs and the thousand-odd lost souls who make up the BNP's active ranks, and turn them, and the party, into a viable political machine. He thinks he can reverse decades of defeat for the far right, a political movement whose electoral fortunes generally run a poor second to the Monster Raving Loony Party. He believes he can make fascism and racial hatred acceptable around the (white) British dinner table by couching his politics in the language of moderation.</p> <p>\"People of my nationalist political persuasion,\" he says, \"have to gain political power in the whole or we gain nothing, and the whole lot, British identity, just vanishes. If we are elected, we will effect a revolution, not bombs, but total change.\" You would expect him to talk like that, and a few months ago it would have been easy to dismiss Griffin as a political irrelevance. The British far right has, for the moment, shattered itself into a thousand antagonistic pieces. At a recent \"demonstration\" against refugees in Margate, the rump of the old National Front could barely muster three minibus-loads of skinheads to march around the town abusing asylum seekers. Even the biggest far-right fragment, Griffin's BNP, is tiny, with fewer than 1,500 members. And Britain seemed, especially under New Labour, immune from the deep-set continental xenophobia that has given rise to J\u00f6rg Haider's Freedom Party in Austria.</p> <p>But, the climate may be changing. In the past year, Britain has seen a staggering, unprecedented rise in racial attacks, from the April 1999 Brixton and Brick Lane bombings, to the uncovering of alleged racial murders in Telford, to assaults in Leeds and the stabbing of the white boyfriend of black British athlete, Ashia Hansen, and threats to three other black Olympic sportsmen. Last week, it was reported that TV star Ali G had received death threats, apparently from the neo-Nazi group Combat 18. Many other racial incidents remain unreported, while black members of the public, such as Duwayne Brooks, the friend of Stephen Lawrence, complain of continued and increased police harassment - in spite of the Macpherson report.</p> <p>The whole political mood music around race has, as black trades union leader Bill Morris noted, once more become hostile, intemperate and vengeful. A few Romanian beggars on the London Underground is officially a national crisis. \"These people have come here with the intention of exploiting the system and exploiting their children. It's a vile thing to do,\" spat out New Labour's Home Office minister, Barbara Roche, in March, after private Labour focus-group polling revealed the asylum issue to be an electoral worry.</p> <p>The Conservative leader William Hague is now blaming the government for the \"racketeers\" who are creating \"a massive influx of bogus asylum seekers\". His deputy, Ann Widdecombe, has proposed detention - summary imprisonment - of all asylum seekers. The issue was the highlight of the Tories' May 4 local government election manifesto. To their shame, New Labour's answer was to crank up the rhetoric and promise more \"crackdowns\", arrests, \u00a310,000 bonds for \"dodgy\" Indian subcontinent visitors, new detention centres, vouchers-for-food, more \"dispersals\", fewer \"disproportionate burdens\", and the faster processing of applicants.</p> <p>Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, has now announced plans to detain in secure accommodation asylum seekers whose applications have been refused. The \"crisis\" is directly attributed to the \"flood\" of asylum seekers now \"invading\" Britain. Hyped up by right-wing populist newspapers, \"refugee\" has practically become synonymous with \"benefit abuser/beggar\". But the cold reality is that the asylum seeker \"epidemic\" is largely the political creation of tabloid editorials, William Hague's ambitions and Downing Street's electoral worries.</p> <p>In 1996, under the Tories, applications for asylum were 29,000. In 1997, the figure rose to 33,000, in 1998 to 46,000 and in 1999 to 71,000. This is a large increase, but still statistically insignificant given Britain's population of 60 million. If you average the figures over the past four years - 50,000 asylum seeker applications per annum - the British Home Office, under its international obligations, is being asked, in population terms, to consider one refugee case for every 12,000 UK citizens. Given that many applications will be rejected, the true figure for successful applicants is probably 1 per 25,000 native head of population. New Labour's ministers may, in their harsh, tabloid-pleasing rhetoric, be fighting back a \"flood\", but the asylum seekers \"crisis\" is actually a trickle.</p> <p>\"By heralding measure after measure to stop people entering Britain, the Home Office has given life to racists,\" says Bill Morris. In the elections for the London Mayor on May 4, the British National Party candidate polled 78,000 first and second preference votes - that is 10% of Ken Livingstone's vote. \"The asylum seeker issue has been great for us,\" says Nick Griffin. \"We have had phenomenal growth in membership. It's been quite fun to watch government ministers and the Tories play the race card in far cruder terms than we would ever use, but pretend not to. This issue legitimises us.\"</p> <p>Griffin is not alone in believing that the racist tide is turning his way. \"Race, through the asylum seeker issue, is going to be a big issue in the next election,\" says Claire Dissington, of the Anti-Nazi League. \"If racism is legitimised through the mainstream parties, then the far right can only benefit. Already there has been an increase in attacks. If it continues, we are going to end up with a dead refugee.\"</p> <p>Britain's would-be fascist leader is, of course, enthralled at the potential political opportunities of increased racial tension. Griffin, who has devoted his adult life to the fascist cause, wants to use a new wave of racial strife to re-unite those far-right fragments. He wants to make the BNP better so he can make things worse. Griffin is worth knowing about because he is the enemy of democratic and human rights.</p> <p>Griffin came down from the hills to meet me in the little town of Welshpool, in mid-Wales, after dropping his four children at school. He was dressed in a neat black polo neck, a well-tailored collarless jacket and a grey wool overcoat. He was polite, friendly and clever enough to have looked me up on the internet and therefore be able to quote my own articles back at me. He has the air of being a cross between a hearty country estate agent and an eager but slightly clumsy novice Conservative candidate. He might live in Wales, but he speaks with an earnest English Home Counties accent. He raises pigs and chickens on his smallholding in the hills and there was dirt under his fingernails, but he is obviously far more at home behind a keyboard than a tractor. </p> <p>Griffin's greatest political asset to the BNP is his smoothness, his seeming reasonableness. He is not some Ku-Klux Klan American-style Nazi frothing at the mouth. Instead, Griffin articulates blatantly racist policy as if enunciating the latest New Labour tweak to the mainstream consensus. \"If the liberals would just let us have one island, one place, where we could go and do what we want to do by ourselves, most white nationalists would be quite happy to have it. But the liberal mind-set is utterly totalitarian. There is not one village, one farmhouse, if you have a TV, where I can hold my views and put them across to my children,\" says Griffin, whose Welsh farmhouse is resolutely television-free. </p> <p>His language is peppered with terms such as \"half-caste\", \"our British identity\" and the ubiquitous \"they\", as in \"they do not really adapt well to our schools\". He makes great play of his changes to what even he admits were the old-style really crude racist policies of the BNP. Officially, the party now has a policy of voluntary repatriation for non-whites. \"We would obviously give preference, in terms of homeward-bound grants, to couples with young families, couples with children aged 14 and younger. If they are here any longer then they are probably going to stay. We want them [black Britons] to go, and the number who go will be determined by how good it is over there and whether their children have a better life,\" he says. </p> <p>Unofficially, Griffin is trying to move the party towards what he thinks everyone else will see as the acceptable face of Haider's Euro-fascism. \"Haider is a straw in the wind for us, which shows what a nationalist party can do by moderating its language and thus appealing to ordinary people.\" </p> <p> As part of that \"strategy of moderation\", Griffin has created front organisations, including The Countryman and Save Our Sterling, to campaign on specific issues, such as the farming crisis or the pound, in order to garner support and legitimise the BNP's agenda. He is a great believer in the internet, and the party has invested heavily in its website to spread the message. He is cheerfully full of spin, a self-acknowledged political opportunist for his racialist cause. </p> <p>Wherever there is racial tension over asylum seekers, or a political gripe over low lamb prices, paedophiles, Ireland, the euro, new houses on greenfield sites, Stop The City demonstrations, he wants to join in, make it all worse, and recruit new members for the BNP. He is preparing for the day when some economic catastrophe revolutionises the BNP's political fortunes in the same way that mass unemployment facilitated Hitler's rise to power. The BNP's answer to this future crisis in global capitalism is novel and direct: withdraw from the European Union, whatever the economic consequences, impose import controls, and then hope to rule through the following chaos. </p> <p>As befits a party leader, Griffin tries to come over as sincere and reasonable. He seems to think that by speaking calmly, as if the voice of moderation, it somehow makes racist and bigoted statements acceptable. </p> <p>Griffin specifically moved to the Welsh countryside to escape multi-racial Britain. His own children now go to a local school near Welshpool. I asked him about that. \"Would it bother me if there were a number of black children in the school? No. There were a couple of black children in the school when I was young, doesn't bother me, not a problem.\" I asked Griffin if he ever felt threatened by black people. \"No, not at all, on an individual basis. It's a matter of survival, of our people, of our identity, as a whole. You can take small numbers of people, you can have someone as a friend.\" He claims to have black friends. </p> <p>Griffin is against homosexuality, and GM foods; he is pro British beef-on-the bone, but is suspicious of the \"environmentalist way of thinking, which is pure Marxism\". He was really incensed about what he calls feminism's forcible conscription of little girls to be engineers, blaming \"the neo-communist social attitudes of the 60s\", which order us all to believe \"we are a blank slate\". </p> <p>Griffin denies he is anti-Semitic. But in 1997, he published Mind-Benders, a tract that listed hundreds of Jews in the British media and purported to show evidence of the \"globalist\" - a code word for Jewish - conspiracy against the white race. In 1998, he was convicted of inciting racial hatred for publishing a white separatist/Holocaust denial magazine, The Rune. He was sentenced to nine months, suspended for two years. </p> <p>Like the pro-Hitler historian David Irving, who Griffin says he has met only once, no fact, no argument, will ever challenge his racial views. \"The debate on the Holocaust is not going to go away. Irving is not all that revisionist. There are others who are far more capable [of disproving the Holocaust].\" </p> <p>Griffin did not stop talking for three hours. We did a world's tour of the justifications for racism, from matrilineal DNA, the migration patterns 10,000 years ago of the Celts and the Scots, to the banana economics of \"voluntary repatriation\" (under the BNP, Britain would offer to buy all its bananas from the West Indies for 30 years in return for Caribbean agreement to the \"repatriation\" of black British citizens). Every so often, Griffin will slip in his own distinctive takes on Britain today. When he talks about \"racial attacks\", he means attacks by Asians on whites, and when he mentions \"multi-culturalism\", he uses it as an insult. </p> <p>It is impossible to argue with him rationally. Griffin speaks, possibly even dreams, in a separate political language, in which race is the defining characteristic of everything. His arguments are a mish-mash of lies, intellectual confusions and illegitimate justifications. It is, after a time, almost painful, exhausting to be in his company. He buttresses his \"argument\" with anecdote or \"incontestable\" statistic, or made-up opinion poll. He does not so much defend a coherent political position as promote a moving chain of disparate but inter-linked prejudices. There is no real order to his thought. If you challenge him on one position, he simply jumps to another. \"On individual policies, parts of policies, any individual, any party, makes mistakes. When you are in power, you have to adjust them. But the fundamental roots of my belief, evolutionary psychology, that human beings are the way they are primarily because of nature rather than nurture, is fixed. I do not just believe I am right, I know I am right. People are born different.\" </p> <p>There is one other thing that is fixed. The BNP's unalterable starting and finishing point is the same; black people are inferior to white and there is a Jewish conspiracy to control the world. The BNP's aim is to remove the political rights of millions of British citizens because they are black or Jewish. </p> <p>Griffin, now 40, has been a full-time politico since he lied about his age and joined the National Front when he was 14, in 1974. Griffin comes from a right-wing political background. His parents met as Young Conservative hecklers at a Communist Party meeting. His father, Edgar, was an accountant, and the family lived in Halesworth, in Suffolk, far from the racial frontlines of Britain of the 70s. Griffin attended a minor public school, St Felix in Southwold, where, after winning a scholarship, he was one of just two boys in the all girls' school. In his boyish enthusiasm, Griffin stood in a school mock election campaign for the 1974 general election - as the National Front candidate. </p> <p>Industrial strife and the three-day-week convulsed Britain in the early 70s. Governments lurched from crisis to crisis, and in 1972 Idi Amin forcibly expelled 50,000 Ugandan Asians to Britain, an opportunity seized upon by racists to renew tensions triggered by 60s immigration rows and Enoch Powell's infamous \"rivers of blood\" speech. For Griffin and his father, it was time to join a new party, the National Front. </p> <p>\"It was a time when a large number of right-wing Tories, and people on the left, were quite convinced that Soviet-style communism was inevitable. The idea was that every Labour government ratcheted things to the left. The Tories were not ratcheting it back successfully - especially under Heath. My father saw a letter in the local paper from the NF's Norwich organiser. We went along to a local meeting and there was a speaker saying what I felt, what I had felt in a long, long while. I was not happy with everything in the NF, but it was a lot better than the Tory party.\" </p> <p>Founded in 1967 to exploit racial tensions, the National Front grew rapidly and was, in name, soon Britain's fourth largest political party - in the 1979 General Election, it fielded 300 candidates. Soon, young Griffin was spending every free weekend at Excalibur House, the NF's headquarters in East London, doing security shifts, leaflet runs or provoking racial strife by selling NF papers at the local market in Hackney on Sundays. It was inspiring work for a young political soldier of the far right. \"If you look back in hindsight, the NF was violence and skinheads and that kind of stuff - sub-proletarian hooliganism. But in 1974 it was not,\" he asserts. \"When I joined as a young face, there were strong NF branches - Lewisham, Tower Hamlets, parts of Greenwich, Hackney - in places that are now almost exclusively non-white. There would be no point in trying to sell papers there now.\" </p> <p>The National Front may have wanted to achieve semi-respectability, but its efforts were thwarted by the Nazi past of its leader, John Tyndall. Tyndall had been tried and convicted in the early 60s for paramilitary-style offences under legislation designed to curb the activities of Sir Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists in the 30s. In his defence, Tyndall told the court, \"I am convinced that a peaceful social revolution as set out in Mein Kampf is what Britain requires to carry her back to her place in the world.\" Decades later, Tyndall was Griffin's immediate predecessor as head of the BNP. </p> <p> The National Front was soon inextricably linked to street violence and racial attacks. For many of the NF's skinhead members, that was part of the attraction. Violence has been a hallmark of the British far right. Despite the spin and attempt at a moderate image, Griffin's new-look BNP is not so different from the National Front of the 70s. Griffin's BNP leadership election campaign manager, Tony Lecomber, was jailed in 1986 for three years for possessing explosives. In 1995, in The Rune magazine, Griffin himself wrote about the need to defend \"rights for whites\" with \"well-directed boots and fists\". </p> <p>Griffin went to Cambridge University in 1977, where he studied history and law at the all-male, sporty Downing College, graduating with a 2:2 and a boxing blue. (He took up boxing after a fight with an anti-fascist in Lewisham.) At university, he was a social pariah. In a Union debate, he revealed his Front membership and was door-stepped by two student journalists. His face was plastered over the student newspaper. He says he filled his time with boxing training, weekends away with the Sealed Knot Society, re-enacting battles between Cavaliers and Roundheads, and other weekends enacting the racial revolution for the National Front. He even founded the Young National Front Students. You would have thought, given his extreme right-wing views, he would have found himself entirely isolated at university. If he was, he downplays it. \"No one was significantly fussed about it. Had I been at Essex, it would have been a different thing. I knew people - known to be Front - who had a terrible time. They would walk in and no one would serve them in the college bar. If you believe something is right, it's a matter of self-respect that you stand up for it, even if other people tell you it's wrong.\" </p> <p>After university, Griffin became a political worker at National Front HQ. But the far right was soon facing a crisis. The rise and rise of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, with her populist anti-trades union platform and victory in the Falklands in 1982, was sucking the political ground from beneath the National Front's feet. The far right started to splinter into a myriad of tiny groups. Tyndall walked out of the National Front in 1980, just before he was expelled. </p> <p>For Griffin, there is no real bridge between his nationalist politics and Conservatism. \"The Conservative Party is committedly internationalist and pure straight economic capitalist in its outlook. It does not have a nationalist outlook in its head. The Conservative problem with immigration is purely reactionary. It's because of black crime, or something like that. Whereas I would be opposed to immigration even if it was from people who, in larger numbers, were more law-abiding than us, more hard-working, cleverer than us and more productive. I would be opposed if it meant they were going to take over the country and change it so we do not have a homeland - which every people needs if it's going to survive.\" </p> <p>In the past, the first-past-the-post electoral system made it difficult for extremist parties to get elected. The National Front might, in moments of acute racial division over issues such as the Ugandan Asians in the mid-70s, have won up to 10% of the vote, but mostly it barely retained its deposit, never mind won seats. In 25 years, the far right has only ever won one council seat - in 1993 in Tower Hamlets - and promptly lost it five months later. The unremitting message from the British electorate was rejection. </p> <p>Crucially, the electoral system also created mainstream political parties that were informal \"broad-church coalitions\" with their own internal spectrum of left-right division. This allowed the right of the Conservative Party to expand into the political space the far right hoped to occupy on race or Europe. \"Since 1958, every mainstream political party in Europe has been pro-European,\" says Roger Eatwell, professor of European politics at Bath University, and an expert on the far right. \"In Austria, the anti-European alliance, outside the mainstream, was very important for Haider. In Britain, Europe has been a politicised issue, but the NF/BNP has still failed to develop a 'political space'. They are tainted as a Nazi party, and although people might pick up on bits of their programme, they can get many of the same ideas from the Conservative Party. Why vote for a bunch of bumbling incompetents when you can vote for a successful political party?\" </p> <p> Devolution, the new English regional assemblies, proportional representation, together with Griffin's \"strategy of moderation\", may however work in the BNP's favour. Ironically, out of sheer apathy by the legitimate parties, Griffin's BNP managed to get a councillor elected, unopposed, in Bromyard, Herefordshire in this month's council elections. \"They are not going to take over the world tomorrow, but they are always there, festering away in the background,\" said a spokesman from the anti-fascist magazine Searchlight. \"Where there is a lot of racism, there is potential for these groups to grow.\" </p> <p>In 1983, and again in 1986, there were shattering splits in the NF provoked by personal hatreds, but also by an ideological struggle between competing doctrines of violent street fascism or the failed electoral road. Griffin was instrumental in founding one of the more obscure factions, the International Third Position - a fascist cross between socialism and capitalism - which supported Libya's Colonel Gadaffi and Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. Griffin infamously went to Tripoli in the late 80s to see if the Colonel would come up with some cash, just after the American bombing. </p> <p>Griffin's Libyan trip, and his flirtation with various crackpot dictators, has itself given rise to a number of conspiracy theories about Griffin himself - that he has links with MI6 (something he denies). In the early 80s, a small group of fascists arrived in London, including Roberto Fiore and Massimo Morsello, both of whom were wanted by the Italian police in connection with offences concerning \"subversive\" association with armed groups. All Italian efforts to extradite the men from London failed. In the late 80s, when a Labour MP asked whether the two Italians had a connection with MI6, he received the standard government response to intelligence matters - that \"a reply would not be in the public interest\". It was taken as an indicator that Fiore and the others had indeed been recruited by MI6 and offered sanctuary in London. A lawyer for the two men later said that the Home Secretary had specified that extradition was denied because of insufficient evidence and because there are no equivalents in English law of the crimes they were accused of. </p> <p>For years, Fiore and Griffin, as he himself admits, were ideological soul mates on the International Third Position. Fiore was his fascist mentor. And there are other links. Edgar Griffin, Nick Griffin's father, is still listed as the accountant on two charities connected to Fiore. These charities had their bank accounts seized last December by the Charity Commission amid suspicions that the money raised through their charity shops was being channelled to Fiore's fascist political party. The commission has yet to report. </p> <p>By 1989, the National Front was national no longer. It collapsed in on itself and Griffin moved on. In 1990, Griffin had a serious accident that left him blinded in one eye. A shotgun cartridge buried amid burning rubbish exploded in his face. His left eye was badly damaged and had to be surgically removed. The painful injury left him depressed and he dropped out of his brand of politics for two years. He uses a glass eye. In 1994, Griffin was declared bankrupt after a property development project he was involved in went badly wrong. </p> <p>Griffin returned to far-right politics after an offer from the old British Nazi, John Tyndall. After leaving the National Front in 1980, Tyndall had re-founded the British National Party in 1982 to keep the fascist flame alive in an ever tighter vessel. In 1996, Griffin began to edit Tyndall's personal mouthpiece, Spearhead magazine. After 36 issues and various machinations, he stood against Tyndall in a postal ballot for the BNP leadership and won. But, by then, every single household in Britain had already heard from Nick Griffin. He personally wrote the BNP's 1999 Euro manifesto. BNP election campaign leaflets were, under our electoral laws, pushed through 16 million letterboxes. </p> <p>Will we be hearing from Nick Griffin in the future? Will the race issue, in its new guise as the \"bogus asylum seekers crisis\", dominate the forthcoming General Election, and will the two main political parties continue to use racist rhetoric borrowed from fascism? Or will the latest, and hopefully the last, British fascist leader suffer political oblivion in the Welsh hills. Unlike in France or Austria, the British far right has never managed to re-invent itself as a legitimate political movement. That will not stop Nick Griffin</p>",

      "bodyText": "Race is once more on the agenda in British politics, and at least one party on the far right is confidently hoping to capitalise on it. From his fastness in the Welsh hills, Nick Griffin, elected head of the British National Party (BNP) last autumn, is plotting to revive the fortunes of the most reviled party in Britain with a new strategy that he hopes will suit the temper of the times. Gone are the swastikas, the shaved heads, the marches with Union Jacks fluttering. Instead, there is the stream of innocuous-sounding front organisations, the South West Family Defence Organisation, the British Countryman, Save Our Sterling, promoted in smooth fireside chats over the internet. Griffin wants to cast off the Nazi-worshipping past of his predecessors, he wants to remould the riff-raff, the social misfits, the racists, the anti-Semites, the skinheads, street thugs and the thousand-odd lost souls who make up the BNP's active ranks, and turn them, and the party, into a viable political machine. He thinks he can reverse decades of defeat for the far right, a political movement whose electoral fortunes generally run a poor second to the Monster Raving Loony Party. He believes he can make fascism and racial hatred acceptable around the (white) British dinner table by couching his politics in the language of moderation. \"People of my nationalist political persuasion,\" he says, \"have to gain political power in the whole or we gain nothing, and the whole lot, British identity, just vanishes. If we are elected, we will effect a revolution, not bombs, but total change.\" You would expect him to talk like that, and a few months ago it would have been easy to dismiss Griffin as a political irrelevance. The British far right has, for the moment, shattered itself into a thousand antagonistic pieces. At a recent \"demonstration\" against refugees in Margate, the rump of the old National Front could barely muster three minibus-loads of skinheads to march around the town abusing asylum seekers. Even the biggest far-right fragment, Griffin's BNP, is tiny, with fewer than 1,500 members. And Britain seemed, especially under New Labour, immune from the deep-set continental xenophobia that has given rise to J\u00f6rg Haider's Freedom Party in Austria. But, the climate may be changing. In the past year, Britain has seen a staggering, unprecedented rise in racial attacks, from the April 1999 Brixton and Brick Lane bombings, to the uncovering of alleged racial murders in Telford, to assaults in Leeds and the stabbing of the white boyfriend of black British athlete, Ashia Hansen, and threats to three other black Olympic sportsmen. Last week, it was reported that TV star Ali G had received death threats, apparently from the neo-Nazi group Combat 18. Many other racial incidents remain unreported, while black members of the public, such as Duwayne Brooks, the friend of Stephen Lawrence, complain of continued and increased police harassment - in spite of the Macpherson report. The whole political mood music around race has, as black trades union leader Bill Morris noted, once more become hostile, intemperate and vengeful. A few Romanian beggars on the London Underground is officially a national crisis. \"These people have come here with the intention of exploiting the system and exploiting their children. It's a vile thing to do,\" spat out New Labour's Home Office minister, Barbara Roche, in March, after private Labour focus-group polling revealed the asylum issue to be an electoral worry. The Conservative leader William Hague is now blaming the government for the \"racketeers\" who are creating \"a massive influx of bogus asylum seekers\". His deputy, Ann Widdecombe, has proposed detention - summary imprisonment - of all asylum seekers. The issue was the highlight of the Tories' May 4 local government election manifesto. To their shame, New Labour's answer was to crank up the rhetoric and promise more \"crackdowns\", arrests, \u00a310,000 bonds for \"dodgy\" Indian subcontinent visitors, new detention centres, vouchers-for-food, more \"dispersals\", fewer \"disproportionate burdens\", and the faster processing of applicants. Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, has now announced plans to detain in secure accommodation asylum seekers whose applications have been refused. The \"crisis\" is directly attributed to the \"flood\" of asylum seekers now \"invading\" Britain. Hyped up by right-wing populist newspapers, \"refugee\" has practically become synonymous with \"benefit abuser/beggar\". But the cold reality is that the asylum seeker \"epidemic\" is largely the political creation of tabloid editorials, William Hague's ambitions and Downing Street's electoral worries. In 1996, under the Tories, applications for asylum were 29,000. In 1997, the figure rose to 33,000, in 1998 to 46,000 and in 1999 to 71,000. This is a large increase, but still statistically insignificant given Britain's population of 60 million. If you average the figures over the past four years - 50,000 asylum seeker applications per annum - the British Home Office, under its international obligations, is being asked, in population terms, to consider one refugee case for every 12,000 UK citizens. Given that many applications will be rejected, the true figure for successful applicants is probably 1 per 25,000 native head of population. New Labour's ministers may, in their harsh, tabloid-pleasing rhetoric, be fighting back a \"flood\", but the asylum seekers \"crisis\" is actually a trickle. \"By heralding measure after measure to stop people entering Britain, the Home Office has given life to racists,\" says Bill Morris. In the elections for the London Mayor on May 4, the British National Party candidate polled 78,000 first and second preference votes - that is 10% of Ken Livingstone's vote. \"The asylum seeker issue has been great for us,\" says Nick Griffin. \"We have had phenomenal growth in membership. It's been quite fun to watch government ministers and the Tories play the race card in far cruder terms than we would ever use, but pretend not to. This issue legitimises us.\" Griffin is not alone in believing that the racist tide is turning his way. \"Race, through the asylum seeker issue, is going to be a big issue in the next election,\" says Claire Dissington, of the Anti-Nazi League. \"If racism is legitimised through the mainstream parties, then the far right can only benefit. Already there has been an increase in attacks. If it continues, we are going to end up with a dead refugee.\" Britain's would-be fascist leader is, of course, enthralled at the potential political opportunities of increased racial tension. Griffin, who has devoted his adult life to the fascist cause, wants to use a new wave of racial strife to re-unite those far-right fragments. He wants to make the BNP better so he can make things worse. Griffin is worth knowing about because he is the enemy of democratic and human rights. Griffin came down from the hills to meet me in the little town of Welshpool, in mid-Wales, after dropping his four children at school. He was dressed in a neat black polo neck, a well-tailored collarless jacket and a grey wool overcoat. He was polite, friendly and clever enough to have looked me up on the internet and therefore be able to quote my own articles back at me. He has the air of being a cross between a hearty country estate agent and an eager but slightly clumsy novice Conservative candidate. He might live in Wales, but he speaks with an earnest English Home Counties accent. He raises pigs and chickens on his smallholding in the hills and there was dirt under his fingernails, but he is obviously far more at home behind a keyboard than a tractor. Griffin's greatest political asset to the BNP is his smoothness, his seeming reasonableness. He is not some Ku-Klux Klan American-style Nazi frothing at the mouth. Instead, Griffin articulates blatantly racist policy as if enunciating the latest New Labour tweak to the mainstream consensus. \"If the liberals would just let us have one island, one place, where we could go and do what we want to do by ourselves, most white nationalists would be quite happy to have it. But the liberal mind-set is utterly totalitarian. There is not one village, one farmhouse, if you have a TV, where I can hold my views and put them across to my children,\" says Griffin, whose Welsh farmhouse is resolutely television-free. His language is peppered with terms such as \"half-caste\", \"our British identity\" and the ubiquitous \"they\", as in \"they do not really adapt well to our schools\". He makes great play of his changes to what even he admits were the old-style really crude racist policies of the BNP. Officially, the party now has a policy of voluntary repatriation for non-whites. \"We would obviously give preference, in terms of homeward-bound grants, to couples with young families, couples with children aged 14 and younger. If they are here any longer then they are probably going to stay. We want them [black Britons] to go, and the number who go will be determined by how good it is over there and whether their children have a better life,\" he says. Unofficially, Griffin is trying to move the party towards what he thinks everyone else will see as the acceptable face of Haider's Euro-fascism. \"Haider is a straw in the wind for us, which shows what a nationalist party can do by moderating its language and thus appealing to ordinary people.\" As part of that \"strategy of moderation\", Griffin has created front organisations, including The Countryman and Save Our Sterling, to campaign on specific issues, such as the farming crisis or the pound, in order to garner support and legitimise the BNP's agenda. He is a great believer in the internet, and the party has invested heavily in its website to spread the message. He is cheerfully full of spin, a self-acknowledged political opportunist for his racialist cause. Wherever there is racial tension over asylum seekers, or a political gripe over low lamb prices, paedophiles, Ireland, the euro, new houses on greenfield sites, Stop The City demonstrations, he wants to join in, make it all worse, and recruit new members for the BNP. He is preparing for the day when some economic catastrophe revolutionises the BNP's political fortunes in the same way that mass unemployment facilitated Hitler's rise to power. The BNP's answer to this future crisis in global capitalism is novel and direct: withdraw from the European Union, whatever the economic consequences, impose import controls, and then hope to rule through the following chaos. As befits a party leader, Griffin tries to come over as sincere and reasonable. He seems to think that by speaking calmly, as if the voice of moderation, it somehow makes racist and bigoted statements acceptable. Griffin specifically moved to the Welsh countryside to escape multi-racial Britain. His own children now go to a local school near Welshpool. I asked him about that. \"Would it bother me if there were a number of black children in the school? No. There were a couple of black children in the school when I was young, doesn't bother me, not a problem.\" I asked Griffin if he ever felt threatened by black people. \"No, not at all, on an individual basis. It's a matter of survival, of our people, of our identity, as a whole. You can take small numbers of people, you can have someone as a friend.\" He claims to have black friends. Griffin is against homosexuality, and GM foods; he is pro British beef-on-the bone, but is suspicious of the \"environmentalist way of thinking, which is pure Marxism\". He was really incensed about what he calls feminism's forcible conscription of little girls to be engineers, blaming \"the neo-communist social attitudes of the 60s\", which order us all to believe \"we are a blank slate\". Griffin denies he is anti-Semitic. But in 1997, he published Mind-Benders, a tract that listed hundreds of Jews in the British media and purported to show evidence of the \"globalist\" - a code word for Jewish - conspiracy against the white race. In 1998, he was convicted of inciting racial hatred for publishing a white separatist/Holocaust denial magazine, The Rune. He was sentenced to nine months, suspended for two years. Like the pro-Hitler historian David Irving, who Griffin says he has met only once, no fact, no argument, will ever challenge his racial views. \"The debate on the Holocaust is not going to go away. Irving is not all that revisionist. There are others who are far more capable [of disproving the Holocaust].\" Griffin did not stop talking for three hours. We did a world's tour of the justifications for racism, from matrilineal DNA, the migration patterns 10,000 years ago of the Celts and the Scots, to the banana economics of \"voluntary repatriation\" (under the BNP, Britain would offer to buy all its bananas from the West Indies for 30 years in return for Caribbean agreement to the \"repatriation\" of black British citizens). Every so often, Griffin will slip in his own distinctive takes on Britain today. When he talks about \"racial attacks\", he means attacks by Asians on whites, and when he mentions \"multi-culturalism\", he uses it as an insult. It is impossible to argue with him rationally. Griffin speaks, possibly even dreams, in a separate political language, in which race is the defining characteristic of everything. His arguments are a mish-mash of lies, intellectual confusions and illegitimate justifications. It is, after a time, almost painful, exhausting to be in his company. He buttresses his \"argument\" with anecdote or \"incontestable\" statistic, or made-up opinion poll. He does not so much defend a coherent political position as promote a moving chain of disparate but inter-linked prejudices. There is no real order to his thought. If you challenge him on one position, he simply jumps to another. \"On individual policies, parts of policies, any individual, any party, makes mistakes. When you are in power, you have to adjust them. But the fundamental roots of my belief, evolutionary psychology, that human beings are the way they are primarily because of nature rather than nurture, is fixed. I do not just believe I am right, I know I am right. People are born different.\" There is one other thing that is fixed. The BNP's unalterable starting and finishing point is the same; black people are inferior to white and there is a Jewish conspiracy to control the world. The BNP's aim is to remove the political rights of millions of British citizens because they are black or Jewish. Griffin, now 40, has been a full-time politico since he lied about his age and joined the National Front when he was 14, in 1974. Griffin comes from a right-wing political background. His parents met as Young Conservative hecklers at a Communist Party meeting. His father, Edgar, was an accountant, and the family lived in Halesworth, in Suffolk, far from the racial frontlines of Britain of the 70s. Griffin attended a minor public school, St Felix in Southwold, where, after winning a scholarship, he was one of just two boys in the all girls' school. In his boyish enthusiasm, Griffin stood in a school mock election campaign for the 1974 general election - as the National Front candidate. Industrial strife and the three-day-week convulsed Britain in the early 70s. Governments lurched from crisis to crisis, and in 1972 Idi Amin forcibly expelled 50,000 Ugandan Asians to Britain, an opportunity seized upon by racists to renew tensions triggered by 60s immigration rows and Enoch Powell's infamous \"rivers of blood\" speech. For Griffin and his father, it was time to join a new party, the National Front. \"It was a time when a large number of right-wing Tories, and people on the left, were quite convinced that Soviet-style communism was inevitable.

Why vote for a bunch of bumbling incompetents when you can vote for a successful political party?\" Devolution, the new English regional assemblies, proportional representation, together with Griffin's \"strategy of moderation\", may however work in the BNP's favour. Ironically, out of sheer apathy by the legitimate parties, Griffin's BNP managed to get a councillor elected, unopposed, in Bromyard, Herefordshire in this month's council elections. \"They are not going to take over the world tomorrow, but they are always there, festering away in the background,\" said a spokesman from the anti-fascist magazine Searchlight. \"Where there is a lot of racism, there is potential for these groups to grow.\" In 1983, and again in 1986, there were shattering splits in the NF provoked by personal hatreds, but also by an ideological struggle between competing doctrines of violent street fascism or the failed electoral road. Griffin was instrumental in founding one of the more obscure factions, the International Third Position - a fascist cross between socialism and capitalism - which supported Libya's Colonel Gadaffi and Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. Griffin infamously went to Tripoli in the late 80s to see if the Colonel would come up with some cash, just after the American bombing. Griffin's Libyan trip, and his flirtation with various crackpot dictators, has itself given rise to a number of conspiracy theories about Griffin himself - that he has links with MI6 (something he denies). In the early 80s, a small group of fascists arrived in London, including Roberto Fiore and Massimo Morsello, both of whom were wanted by the Italian police in connection with offences concerning \"subversive\" association with armed groups. All Italian efforts to extradite the men from London failed. In the late 80s, when a Labour MP asked whether the two Italians had a connection with MI6, he received the standard government response to intelligence matters - that \"a reply would not be in the public interest\". It was taken as an indicator that Fiore and the others had indeed been recruited by MI6 and offered sanctuary in London. A lawyer for the two men later said that the Home Secretary had specified that extradition was denied because of insufficient evidence and because there are no equivalents in English law of the crimes they were accused of. For years, Fiore and Griffin, as he himself admits, were ideological soul mates on the International Third Position. Fiore was his fascist mentor. And there are other links. Edgar Griffin, Nick Griffin's father, is still listed as the accountant on two charities connected to Fiore. These charities had their bank accounts seized last December by the Charity Commission amid suspicions that the money raised through their charity shops was being channelled to Fiore's fascist political party. The commission has yet to report. By 1989, the National Front was national no longer. It collapsed in on itself and Griffin moved on. In 1990, Griffin had a serious accident that left him blinded in one eye. A shotgun cartridge buried amid burning rubbish exploded in his face. His left eye was badly damaged and had to be surgically removed. The painful injury left him depressed and he dropped out of his brand of politics for two years. He uses a glass eye. In 1994, Griffin was declared bankrupt after a property development project he was involved in went badly wrong. Griffin returned to far-right politics after an offer from the old British Nazi, John Tyndall. After leaving the National Front in 1980, Tyndall had re-founded the British National Party in 1982 to keep the fascist flame alive in an ever tighter vessel. In 1996, Griffin began to edit Tyndall's personal mouthpiece, Spearhead magazine. After 36 issues and various machinations, he stood against Tyndall in a postal ballot for the BNP leadership and won. But, by then, every single household in Britain had already heard from Nick Griffin. He personally wrote the BNP's 1999 Euro manifesto. BNP election campaign leaflets were, under our electoral laws, pushed through 16 million letterboxes. Will we be hearing from Nick Griffin in the future? Will the race issue, in its new guise as the \"bogus asylum seekers crisis\", dominate the forthcoming General Election, and will the two main political parties continue to use racist rhetoric borrowed from fascism? Or will the latest, and hopefully the last, British fascist leader suffer political oblivion in the Welsh hills. Unlike in France or Austria, the British far right has never managed to re-invent itself as a legitimate political movement. That will not stop Nick Griffin",

Here, in front of everyone, I - Freako New English Girl - am about to win that most Welsh of prizes, the annual poetry competition. I am the new 13-year-old school Bard. My name is called and a girl puts a purple robe around my shoulders and leads me up to the stage, where a fourth-year is playing the harp. There I am seated on a throne while a cardboard crown is placed on my head and the headmaster reads out my prize-winning ditty.</p> <p>I don't know what happened to me. At my previous school in Broadstairs, I was a popular extrovert. But when we moved to Cardiff, I swear I began to mutate. My shoulders hunched, my skin turned pallid and my hair swung down over my eyes in greasy clumps. I became a geeky swot. Freako New Girl.</p> <p>My coronation was The End. The school bullies set to work on me and I quickly ran out of hiding places. So off I went to another school, where, Dr Who-like, I reinvented myself. Never again would I write a poem. Never would I so much as stick my hand up in class. I exaggerated the Cardiff accent I was acquiring and made out I was Welsh, from across town. I became as bland as possible. Wallpaper Girl.</p> <p>I think back on 1984 as the year in which my basic ideas about myself were undermined. At the first school, I was shown forcibly that I was not the person I had always thought. At the second school, I became a \"yes\" girl, eager to do nothing that would make people hate me. I resented it, feeling that the real me was not this anxious, wafer-thin persona. But the transformation had worked. I was wallpaper. I made friends, got myself a perm and maintained my personality like my hair - sprayed firmly in place; brittle. And from this position of blandness, I began to claw back a personality.</p> <p>A number of years and regenerations later, and another me - adult me (a great deal happier) - is starting a new job at a London literary agency. As I'm walking through the offices for the first time, I can't seem to shake off that Freako New Girl feeling. It's as though someone who knew me Way Back When is about to spring out from behind a partition.</p> <p>It could be worse: the girl who is about to become one of my new colleagues is from the second school in Cardiff, not the first.

My clean slate has been daubed with indelible ink. I imagine my school chum creeping from desk to desk, whispering the truth about me.</p> <p>After watching the film Fight Club on video, I've been thinking about how we reinvent and transform ourselves. There's something intoxicating about public declarations of change: New Year's resolutions, ITV's Year Of Promise. Perhaps the existence of a plaque on a wall saying, \"I promise I'll never sleep with men on the first date again\" really can lead to born-again sexual frugality. A public statement can be the way forward. Break it and you show yourself to be spineless.</p> <p>Even seemingly trivial changes lead to transformation - the makeovers, diets, exercise regimes. You only have to make a brave decision at the hairdressers to acquire an entirely new face (and then, of course, you spend one of those weird evenings sneaking glances into mirrors, and it's like catching sight of an alien).</p> <p>A friend told me about a self-help technique, in which you smile at yourself in the mirror for a full minute each morning. No matter how lousy you're feeling, if you grin for long enough the smile becomes real. I'm not attracted to self-help. Its quick-fix aspects turn me off. Self-help lacks the appealing gloomy grandeur and labyrinthine vastness of psychotherapy and its cohorts.

When I think of all the times I have listened to people who believe they have metamorphosed but who seem unchanged, I begin to wonder.

      "body": "<p>It's early in the summer of 1987, and Peter Sellars is rehearsing the final scenes of his radical reinterpretation of Mozart's Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte, which the producer has infamously sliced out of da Ponte's 18th-century Naples setting and inserted into the chrome and glitter ambience of a Cape Cod diner. In the rehearsal space at Purchase College, New York, where the work is due to be performed, Sellars spends his days assiduously snipping, tucking and reconnecting the meaning of the work, as the usually jaunty reconciliation of Mozart's wayward lovers is scrapped to make way for a much more edgy, ambiguous conclusion, culminating in an angry brawl. During scheduled breaks, the Sellars road-show continues in front of baying packs of America's top culture journalists, eager for a replay of the now- standard conversational fireworks, all sparkling wit and limber philosophical acrobatics. </p> <p>In the evening, Sellars would retire with the rest of the cast to the spartan Purchase dormitories to study the score before catching a little sleep. And then, next morning, just as every morning, \"he would get up very early and read the Bible for an hour\", remembers the conductor Craig Smith, who lived in the dormitory next door - \"I'm talking about five in the morning\" - and would then go and \"do this wild theatrical thing and give interviews and shock all these people\". </p> <p>There are two quite distinct incarnations of opera producer, theatre director, teacher and social activist Peter Sellars. The first is the Sellars we know and love (to hate, in the case of music critics from the Daily Telegraph or the New York Times, circa 1988); the gleeful, spike-haired opera-terrorist running rampage in the citadel of high art with a mallet and a razor-blade. This is the one who has indulged some of the greatest operatic gimmicks of our time: Handel's Orlando set in the Kennedy Space Centre and on Mars, with the unbalanced hero of the opera reborn as a Nasa astronaut; and Giulio Cesare, again by Handel, transported to a semi- constructed but already bombed-out penthouse in the Beirut Hilton. </p> <p>Most notorious of all is his reworking of the da Ponte Mozart trilogy, with not only a Cos\u00ed Fan Tutti in Despina's Diner, but a cor porate Marriage Of Figaro set in the opulence of Trump Tower, and a Don Giovanni set in New York's Spanish Harlem, with a gloriously amoral cocaine-snorting Don who is finally pulled down into the ultimate modern metaphor for hell - the New York sewer system. </p> <p>It's a role that he plays to perfection. Tiki Davies, press attach\u00e9 at New York's Kennedy Arts Centre while Sellars, then 27, was head of the ill-fated American National Theatre, remembers how he would lurk by the exits in wait for outraged, fleeing punters: \"He would stand there and cackle like a maniac as they were scurrying off. He was just delighted that he had touched them.\" \"He loves it,\" says singer James Maddelena, who has worked with Sellars for 20 years. \"If people really hate it and have a kind of strong reaction, then at least he knows he's got through.\" </p> <p>In person, Sellars displays all the traits of the flamboyant, gregarious showman, albeit in a curiously compact form. It is still a jolt to discover that he is just 5ft 6in tall, with an oddly oversized head, and arms that seem barely to reach beyond his waist. There is also that trademark electrostatic burst of hair (he fashions it himself, according to his friend, the librettist Alice Goodman, with an implement resembling garden shears) and the sudden splashes of wild, honking laughter that punctuate his conversation (think Tom Hulce in Amadeus, but shriller). </p> <p>Sellars's Lilliputian size, however, just seems to amplify the atomic levels of his phenomenal energy. Throughout rehearsals for next month's new ENO production of John Adams's opera Nixon In China, the director fizzed with ideas, bounding around the makeshift stage with the exhausted singers in tow, barking out the arias in his motor-horn baritone. He lives only to work, spending much of his time jetting from one gig to the next, never taking a holiday, never indulging the slightest inkling of a conventional personal life, other than visits to his mother and sister. As for love interests: \"It's not really a topic,\" he replies with another honk of laughter, \"I'm just really, really celibate.\" </p> <p>Apart from books and records, which he accumulates with extravagant abandon, Sellars has few vices: he doesn't smoke, drink, do drugs, or even eat very much: \"Just one meal a day,\" he says. \"It is really good for me to be hungry. That little edge is important. It teaches you to see a little clearer.\" And with only three or four hours a night, he sleeps even less: \"I saw him asleep once,\" says the choreographer Mark Morris, a friend and collaborator. \"I went into his room one morning and saw him asleep for, like, one second before he woke up. I didn't think that he slept at all.\" </p> <p>This is the Sellars who bristles with conversational chutzpah, often tossing out contentious declarations: \"Opera has the highest stakes of any of the performing arts but it is usually surrounded by the most trivia\"; or \"I love gimmicks. They are great. They are fun. They are part of life.\" </p> <p>But at the same time there is an entirely different, radically unglamorous, acutely unfashionable dimension to the life and work that couldn't be in greater contrast to his public image of opera b te noire. Despite a punishing schedule of international engagements, Sellars finds time to teach one full trimester a year at the University of Los Angeles, overseeing two courses: \"Art as moral action\" and \"Art as social action,\" both broad examinations of the social, moral and spiritual dimensions of the business of making art. There is also a course option called \"The invisible world\", devoted entirely to an exploration of the spiritual mechanisms of creativity. </p> <p>Naturally, Sellars applies the same flamboyant showmanship to this side of his work, often lecturing non-stop for anything up to three hours, mesmerising his 700-800 students (the course is so popular that the university is forced to hire halls normally used as rock venues) while a ghettoblaster on the podium blares out London trance or aboriginal mouth music. </p> <p>Equally remarkable is his work in the deprived, crime-ridden communities of east LA, where he has so far staged a number of works, including Genet's The Screens and Stravinsky's Soldier's Tale, featuring local Chicano and Latino artists, gang members from the infamous Boyle Heights LA suburb, and unwed mothers. \"People are making this art because it is going to help and it has a lot riding on it,\" he says. \"Therefore, it tends to be more courageous and I think is going to resonate longer than a lot of the art that now occupies more public space but will fade as the fashion changes.\" </p> <p>This is what Sellars himself is also aiming for: deeper social, moral, spiritual and political goals. And while the application of his beliefs - he comes from a Christian Science background - is both more subtle and chaotic in the earlier works, he has been increasingly turning, over the past decade, to overtly religious pieces: a TV-screen-studded production of Messaien's St Francis of Assisi, an equally masterful Theodora at Glyndebourne, Stravinsky's Biblical Pieces, Ligeti's Le Grande Macabre and the forthcoming John Adams opera on the nativity called How Could This Happen? </p> <p>\"We toured Europe with a show that was a combination of Kurt Weill's Mahagonny and Bach cantatas ,\" says Craig Smith, \"It was overtly religious. I remember that in Paris people came expecting to be outraged. I had all these hip theatrical types coming up to me and saying: 'What does this mean, I have never been to church in my life?' That, for them, was the ultimate shock.\" </p> <p> Peter Mark Sellars was born on September 27 1957 in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, the first (and, as it turned out, only) son of Lee Sellars, a radio producer who pioneered the first live phone-in radio shows in the US, and Patricia Palmer, a high-school teacher. The Sellars household was quietly religious, they were Christian Scientists.They disapproved of TV and encouraged the young boy and his sister Juliet to read voraciously and immerse themselves in classical music. From an early age Sellars had an avid interest in natural history: \"He was going to be a herpetologist at one time,\" remembers his mother. \"He had a couple of snakes, which sometimes got loose around the house. It distressed him that snakes had such a bad rap. Their image was not, he felt, very fair.\" </p> <p>Sellars's 10th year would prove to be one of considerable change. First, his parents got divorced, leaving the fractured family in a less than healthy financial situation. Second, he threw himself into what would become the abiding theatrical passion of his teenage years, taking up an informal apprenticeship at the Lovelace Marionette Theatre: \"It was basically a garage in East Pittsburgh painted fuchsia,\" he recalls. \"But there were puppets and masks from all over the world on the walls. My first images of theatre were Javanese shadow puppets and Japanese Bunraku. I was 25 before I knew what a well-made play in a living room was, or saw a kitchen-sink drama.\" </p> <p>Every summer, Sellars and his puppets would perform on the streets of Pittsburgh and nearby towns: \"We were doing all these shows in department store windows and shopping malls. Working on the street is much more difficult, you really have to work out how to make them stay and how to get them to put money in the hat.\" </p> <p>At the age of 14, he was awarded scholarship support to attend the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, one of America's oldest private boarding schools and the alma mater of former president George Bush. \"Even as a ninth grader he displayed total mental concentration, almost superhuman energy and endurance, needing apparently little or no sleep,\" remembers art teacher Robert Lloyd, who allowed young Sellars, in his final year, to teach a fully credited course in puppetry. \"He had listened to an extraordinary amount of music, from classical through contemporary, and his taste was eclectic without being at all shallow. Schumann, Stravinsky, Berio, Stockhausen were equally interesting to him.\" </p> <p>After deferring his place at Harvard, Sellars set off with his mother and sister to spend a sabbatical year in Paris, where he saw Giorgio Strehler's Marriage Of Figaro and Patrice Ch\u00e9reau's Tales Of Hoffman: \"my first experience of opera which was critical of its source\". Before returning to the US, he joined a puppetry delegation to Moscow, which would ignite a love of Russian theatre that would colour his work for decades. </p> <p>In autumn 1975, Sellars finally strode onto the campus at Harvard. Almost immediately the teenage whirlwind began to make an impression on the Ivy League consciousness: \"The university was divided into those people who thought he was a genius and those who thought he was a mountebank,\" says Alice Goodman, a college friend who would go on to write librettos for both the John Adams operas Nixon In China and The Death Of Klinghoffer. \"He had the kind of impeccably 'nice' manner of the sort of person you would take to tea with your grandfather. And of course he could also be hilariously and devastatingly rude - but never unintentionally. He was always very careful and meticulous in his rudeness.\" </p> <p>In the spring of his first year, Sellars became the first freshman in Harvard history to direct a production on the student theatre main-stage, a spectacular bomb that led to Sellars being evicted and told never to return. Instead, he set up a theatre club in the basement of his dormitory, called the Explosives B Cabaret, named after some old signs picked up from an army base. It was here he put on his legendary six-hour version of Wagner's Ring, using human-sized puppets to a recorded accompaniment of the world's classic vocal performances. </p> <p>The popularity of the Explosives B Cabaret forced the Harvard dramatic society reluctantly to readmit Sellars with a season of his productions, leading to yet another undergrad legend: his King Lear. Set in a Lincoln convertible, which was slowly dismantled as the action progressed, Lear was transformed into a play about a group of amoral young people in a materialist society who were just a little too anxious to take over their father's business. Famously, the lead actor came down with severe stage fright just three days before the premiere, forcing Sellars to take over: \"My lines were written everywhere,\" he recalls. \"The rest of the cast knew them - they would be whispering them to me constantly.\" </p> <p>The success of this work drew the attention of theatre guru Robert Brustein, who invited Sellars to work at the American Repertory Theatre (or ART) and, more importantly, introduced him to costume designer Dunya Ramicova and set designer Adrianne Lobel, who would become the core of his collaborative team right into the 90s: \"I think I loved him immediately,\" remembers Lobel, \"For one thing he was very small. When I first met him he was wearing one of those rain parkas, with a little hood. So he had this sort of troll-like appearance. It was like being Dorothy in the Land of Oz. He was like this munchkin, so full of energy and ideas and ready to take on the world.\" </p> <p>The first ART production was a biomechanical version of Gogol's The Government Inspector (Sellars wrote his final-year thesis on the Russian experimental director Meyerhold), featuring a huge transparent plastic curtain separating the rich from the poor. However, Sellars's national breakthrough came with his next ART venture, a radical reinterpretation of Handel's eccentric opera Orlando, set in the Kennedy Space Centre and on Mars, with the lead role now sung by a contralto astronaut, in the process earning a rave from the powerful New Yorker critic Andrew Porter. In 1983, Sellars became the youngest ever recipient of the MacArthur Foundation award, the so-called Genius Award, which came with $136,000. He ploughed most of the money into an ailing and now defunct institution called the Boston Shakespeare Company, where, as artistic director, he staged acclaimed productions of Chekhov's The Seagull, Pericles and the Peter Maxwell Davies opera The Lighthouse. Then, at 26, he was offered the job of setting up an American National Theatre at the Kennedy Centre in Washington. American theatre went into shock. </p> <p>Lobel sums up the unreal atmosphere of the time: \"Suddenly, we seemed to land in all of these highfalutin' giant cultural institutions all over America; the Chicago Lyric Opera, Houston Grand Opera, the Kennedy Centre. And again we felt like really bright children about to turn the world on its ear, taking over these giant toys and being very serious about our work but also incredibly irreverent.\" The venture at the Kennedy Centre, where Sellars sped through $5m in less than a year, soon turned sour. But he had already turned his attention elsewhere, and in 1985 mounted a production of Handel's Giulio Cesare at the PepsiCo Summerfare festival at Purchase, in which the libretto was transformed into a power struggle in the Beirut Hilton, with the invading Americans becoming embroiled in a messy local love affair (not unlike the real US involvement in the Lebanon, minus the love interest) . </p> <p>However, it was the next three productions, staged over three subsequent summers at the Purchase event - Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte (1987), The Trump Tower Figaro (1988) and the Spanish Harlem Don Giovanni which was presented in tandem with the other two in 1989 - that polarised reaction to Sellars. As with all of his contemporary transformations, the primary aim was to strip away the frilly accretions and stuffy attitudes that he felt had trivialised the works: \"These composers are staking their lives, everything they have got, on the biggest issues in the world. It's hard to think that anything could be more important than Beethoven's Fidelio. In Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov he is the destiny of his country and trying to ask his audience the most important questions about its future. In Figaro, Mozart is taking on a play that had officially been banned. This stuff is so daring!\" </p> <p> In the da Ponte trilogy, Sellars's stated aim is to transform the operas into an examination of three strata of American society. The use of the updated contexts, which he refers to as \"surprisingly articulated surfaces\", he feels is supported by solid philosophical reasoning: \"It is the rationale of the believer,\" he says. \"The crucifixion is depicted through most of the history of art [as being] right in the middle of whatever Dutch burghers are doing. Artists are actually going out of their way to paint it as a normal thing, in the middle of a completely contemporary event, because the crucifixion and the resurrection are completely normal things that are happening at every moment in your life for every human being throughout all time.\" Unfortunately, some critics saw it rather differently: \"It remains a mystery why this once precocious director, ostensibly an avant-gardist,\" said the rabid Sellars-baiter Donal Henahan in the New York Times, \"has not concentrated his energies on staging contemporary operas instead of ravaging and bowdlerising existing ones.\" </p> <p>Ironically, Sellars was simultaneously taking the advice of his most outspoken critic almost to the letter. At a convention in the mid-80s, he ran into the minimalist composer John Adams: \"He had seen one of my earlier works,\" says Adams, \"and immediately asked me if I wanted to write an opera and suggested this subject. He even, if I remember rightly, came up immediately with the title, Nixon in China. At first I was less than delighted about the idea, Nixon at the time was persona non grata and generally thought of only in satirical terms.\" </p> <p>Under Sellars's pressure, however, Adams came around. Sellars then turned to Alice Goodman, then a completely unknown writer attempting to establish herself: \"I was living in Cambridge in England and Peter rang and said he wanted me to write an opera called Nixon In China and I immediately said 'yes', because it was a perfect title.\" The plan was to build a \"heroic\" work around the disgraced president, one that would present him, as Adams has said, as \"a visionary and a poignant character, a man whose vanity and paranoia became an Achilles heel\". </p> <p>The resulting opera is a powerful and enigmatic work, a subtle philosophical comedy propelled along by a score which sweeps gracefully from bloated bombast to wrenching introspection: \"A stirring creation, full of charm and wit, and in the end, beauty,\" wrote John Rockwell in the New York Times. \"Unlike so many operas, this one's likely to last.\" </p> <p>Immediately afterwards, the trio began work on the next collaboration: \"I think it was during a staged rehearsal for Nixon,\" says Goodman, \"someone asked us what we wanted to do next. And without any hesitation, Peter just said: 'The Death of Klinghoffer'. And we all just nodded and said 'Yes, of course.' Everybody in the room thought we were joking.\" From the onset, however, Sellars's chosen material - the 1985 hijacking of the liner Achille Lauro, in which a disabled Jew named Leon Klinghoffer was murdered by Palestinian terrorists - proved far more contentious. \"Even before I had a written a note of the score, I was receiving letters from both sides, from Palestinians and Jews, complaining that I was siding with the other,\" says Adams. The 1991 premiere at the Th\u00e9tre Royal del la Monnaie in Brussels, which was in rehearsal as US planes were dropping smart bombs into ventilator shafts in Baghdad, was almost cancelled. In the US, Klinghoffer was greeted by a firestorm of criticism ranging from opportunism to anti-Semitism. Taken on its own merits, however, the opera is musically superior to Nixon and is considered to have mapped out a new direction for the future of minimalism. </p> <p>Much of the 90s coincided with what might be termed Sellars's Los Angeles period. In 1987, he moved there to take over the artistic directorship of the LA festival. What he found profoundly affected him: \"Instead of the usual image of LA as a cultural wasteland, I found that I was dealing with incredible cultural riches.\" One of the first of his large-scale shows to be affected by the LA ethos was his infamous production of Mozart's The Magic Flute at Glyndebourne in 1990, which produced a vitriolic critical reaction. Set under an LA freeway, with a cast of bums, hippies and an Imelda Marcos lookalike, it precipitated the first outbreak of booing at Glyndebourne and the resignation of its then artistic director, Sir Peter Hall. </p> <p>Sellars shifted the focus of the 1991 LA festival to showcase local artists such as the late Iranian theatre visionary Reza Abdoh as well as community-based work, often in public spaces, 85% of which was free. The next (and because of funding difficulties, the last) festival in 1993 had an even deeper impact: \"It was coming off the LA uprising where people set their own city on fire,\" he says, \"That's a very extreme gesture and needs to be responded to seriously, and the politicians were not capable of that. So, it is up to cultural workers. That was an incredibly powerful experience and all my work for the last 10 years has really been responding to 1992.\" </p> <p>Sellars's post-1992 experiments in transplanting the furious conflicts of the riots into classical works took equally daring steps: a Pell\u00e9as And M\u00e9lisande which set Debussy's work in a beach-front condo, with the disaffected hero lurking in a cavernous no-man's land beneath, and Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress set in an LA maximum security prison. In these works, Sellars's objective is made painfully clear: he is attempting to create a highly politicised, Brechtian model of opera, employing classic works, which, he argues, were highly politically relevant in their day, to comment on contemporary society. In straight theatre it's commonplace. But Sellars feels that the inbuilt \"alienation device\" of opera is even more suited to the task: \"You have critical distance, and at the same time the music is so overwhelming that it involves you completely.\" He feels too that opera audiences are the perfect recipients of his message: \"That's why it's an important place to work. You are addressing the power structure. That's who goes to opera.\" </p> <p>The problem for many is Sellars's apocalyptic anti-Americanism, anti-racial-imperialism, anti-corporate message itself. As his critics gleefully point out, his polemic is often deeply contradictory, sometimes gliding neatly into the slipstream of the original libretto, though quite often jarring discordantly with meaning and sense. However, it is these inherent contradictions that make his work so difficult, unwieldy, and ultimately so interesting, and what raises it above arid politics. </p> <p>Those critics and audiences who insist on finding something more coherent in his work need look no further than the Christian principles that guide his vision. \"New England Christianity was all about social justice, and about what it meant to base one's religious beliefs on an idea of social justice and social equity. Those two things, belief and its social implications, are for me tied together so tightly.\" </p> <p>All of this might be impossibly pious or complacent if it weren't so inextricably married with the more outrageous, controversial, and overstated aspects of Sellars's work. And the controversy also keeps his argument alive, though not always understood: \"A lot of productions are important not because anybody saw them,\" he says, \"but because they heard about them. People's imagination of what happened on stage is even more important than what happened on stage. The most important nights in the theatre were seen by only a tiny fraction of the population and yet they have passed into the history of the world.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance : Peter Mark Sellars </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> September 27 1957, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts; Harvard University (BA 1980). </p> <p><strong> Career:</strong> Artistic director: 1983-4 Boston Shakespeare Company; 1984- American National Theatre; 1990 - 93, Los Angeles festival.

      "bodyText": "It's early in the summer of 1987, and Peter Sellars is rehearsing the final scenes of his radical reinterpretation of Mozart's Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte, which the producer has infamously sliced out of da Ponte's 18th-century Naples setting and inserted into the chrome and glitter ambience of a Cape Cod diner. In the rehearsal space at Purchase College, New York, where the work is due to be performed, Sellars spends his days assiduously snipping, tucking and reconnecting the meaning of the work, as the usually jaunty reconciliation of Mozart's wayward lovers is scrapped to make way for a much more edgy, ambiguous conclusion, culminating in an angry brawl. During scheduled breaks, the Sellars road-show continues in front of baying packs of America's top culture journalists, eager for a replay of the now- standard conversational fireworks, all sparkling wit and limber philosophical acrobatics. In the evening, Sellars would retire with the rest of the cast to the spartan Purchase dormitories to study the score before catching a little sleep. And then, next morning, just as every morning, \"he would get up very early and read the Bible for an hour\", remembers the conductor Craig Smith, who lived in the dormitory next door - \"I'm talking about five in the morning\" - and would then go and \"do this wild theatrical thing and give interviews and shock all these people\".

There is also a course option called \"The invisible world\", devoted entirely to an exploration of the spiritual mechanisms of creativity. Naturally, Sellars applies the same flamboyant showmanship to this side of his work, often lecturing non-stop for anything up to three hours, mesmerising his 700-800 students (the course is so popular that the university is forced to hire halls normally used as rock venues) while a ghettoblaster on the podium blares out London trance or aboriginal mouth music.

Working on the street is much more difficult, you really have to work out how to make them stay and how to get them to put money in the hat.\" At the age of 14, he was awarded scholarship support to attend the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, one of America's oldest private boarding schools and the alma mater of former president George Bush. \"Even as a ninth grader he displayed total mental concentration, almost superhuman energy and endurance, needing apparently little or no sleep,\" remembers art teacher Robert Lloyd, who allowed young Sellars, in his final year, to teach a fully credited course in puppetry. \"He had listened to an extraordinary amount of music, from classical through contemporary, and his taste was eclectic without being at all shallow. Schumann, Stravinsky, Berio, Stockhausen were equally interesting to him.\" After deferring his place at Harvard, Sellars set off with his mother and sister to spend a sabbatical year in Paris, where he saw Giorgio Strehler's Marriage Of Figaro and Patrice Ch\u00e9reau's Tales Of Hoffman: \"my first experience of opera which was critical of its source\". Before returning to the US, he joined a puppetry delegation to Moscow, which would ignite a love of Russian theatre that would colour his work for decades. In autumn 1975, Sellars finally strode onto the campus at Harvard. Almost immediately the teenage whirlwind began to make an impression on the Ivy League consciousness: \"The university was divided into those people who thought he was a genius and those who thought he was a mountebank,\" says Alice Goodman, a college friend who would go on to write librettos for both the John Adams operas Nixon In China and The Death Of Klinghoffer. \"He had the kind of impeccably 'nice' manner of the sort of person you would take to tea with your grandfather. And of course he could also be hilariously and devastatingly rude - but never unintentionally. He was always very careful and meticulous in his rudeness.\" In the spring of his first year, Sellars became the first freshman in Harvard history to direct a production on the student theatre main-stage, a spectacular bomb that led to Sellars being evicted and told never to return. Instead, he set up a theatre club in the basement of his dormitory, called the Explosives B Cabaret, named after some old signs picked up from an army base. It was here he put on his legendary six-hour version of Wagner's Ring, using human-sized puppets to a recorded accompaniment of the world's classic vocal performances. The popularity of the Explosives B Cabaret forced the Harvard dramatic society reluctantly to readmit Sellars with a season of his productions, leading to yet another undergrad legend: his King Lear. Set in a Lincoln convertible, which was slowly dismantled as the action progressed, Lear was transformed into a play about a group of amoral young people in a materialist society who were just a little too anxious to take over their father's business. Famously, the lead actor came down with severe stage fright just three days before the premiere, forcing Sellars to take over: \"My lines were written everywhere,\" he recalls. \"The rest of the cast knew them - they would be whispering them to me constantly.\" The success of this work drew the attention of theatre guru Robert Brustein, who invited Sellars to work at the American Repertory Theatre (or ART) and, more importantly, introduced him to costume designer Dunya Ramicova and set designer Adrianne Lobel, who would become the core of his collaborative team right into the 90s: \"I think I loved him immediately,\" remembers Lobel, \"For one thing he was very small. When I first met him he was wearing one of those rain parkas, with a little hood. So he had this sort of troll-like appearance. It was like being Dorothy in the Land of Oz. He was like this munchkin, so full of energy and ideas and ready to take on the world.\" The first ART production was a biomechanical version of Gogol's The Government Inspector (Sellars wrote his final-year thesis on the Russian experimental director Meyerhold), featuring a huge transparent plastic curtain separating the rich from the poor. However, Sellars's national breakthrough came with his next ART venture, a radical reinterpretation of Handel's eccentric opera Orlando, set in the Kennedy Space Centre and on Mars, with the lead role now sung by a contralto astronaut, in the process earning a rave from the powerful New Yorker critic Andrew Porter. In 1983, Sellars became the youngest ever recipient of the MacArthur Foundation award, the so-called Genius Award, which came with $136,000. He ploughed most of the money into an ailing and now defunct institution called the Boston Shakespeare Company, where, as artistic director, he staged acclaimed productions of Chekhov's The Seagull, Pericles and the Peter Maxwell Davies opera The Lighthouse. Then, at 26, he was offered the job of setting up an American National Theatre at the Kennedy Centre in Washington. American theatre went into shock. Lobel sums up the unreal atmosphere of the time: \"Suddenly, we seemed to land in all of these highfalutin' giant cultural institutions all over America; the Chicago Lyric Opera, Houston Grand Opera, the Kennedy Centre. And again we felt like really bright children about to turn the world on its ear, taking over these giant toys and being very serious about our work but also incredibly irreverent.\" The venture at the Kennedy Centre, where Sellars sped through $5m in less than a year, soon turned sour. But he had already turned his attention elsewhere, and in 1985 mounted a production of Handel's Giulio Cesare at the PepsiCo Summerfare festival at Purchase, in which the libretto was transformed into a power struggle in the Beirut Hilton, with the invading Americans becoming embroiled in a messy local love affair (not unlike the real US involvement in the Lebanon, minus the love interest) . However, it was the next three productions, staged over three subsequent summers at the Purchase event - Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte (1987), The Trump Tower Figaro (1988) and the Spanish Harlem Don Giovanni which was presented in tandem with the other two in 1989 - that polarised reaction to Sellars. As with all of his contemporary transformations, the primary aim was to strip away the frilly accretions and stuffy attitudes that he felt had trivialised the works: \"These composers are staking their lives, everything they have got, on the biggest issues in the world. It's hard to think that anything could be more important than Beethoven's Fidelio. In Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov he is the destiny of his country and trying to ask his audience the most important questions about its future. In Figaro, Mozart is taking on a play that had officially been banned. This stuff is so daring!\" In the da Ponte trilogy, Sellars's stated aim is to transform the operas into an examination of three strata of American society. The use of the updated contexts, which he refers to as \"surprisingly articulated surfaces\", he feels is supported by solid philosophical reasoning: \"It is the rationale of the believer,\" he says. \"The crucifixion is depicted through most of the history of art [as being] right in the middle of whatever Dutch burghers are doing. Artists are actually going out of their way to paint it as a normal thing, in the middle of a completely contemporary event, because the crucifixion and the resurrection are completely normal things that are happening at every moment in your life for every human being throughout all time.\" Unfortunately, some critics saw it rather differently: \"It remains a mystery why this once precocious director, ostensibly an avant-gardist,\" said the rabid Sellars-baiter Donal Henahan in the New York Times, \"has not concentrated his energies on staging contemporary operas instead of ravaging and bowdlerising existing ones.\" Ironically, Sellars was simultaneously taking the advice of his most outspoken critic almost to the letter. At a convention in the mid-80s, he ran into the minimalist composer John Adams: \"He had seen one of my earlier works,\" says Adams, \"and immediately asked me if I wanted to write an opera and suggested this subject. He even, if I remember rightly, came up immediately with the title, Nixon in China. At first I was less than delighted about the idea, Nixon at the time was persona non grata and generally thought of only in satirical terms.\" Under Sellars's pressure, however, Adams came around. Sellars then turned to Alice Goodman, then a completely unknown writer attempting to establish herself: \"I was living in Cambridge in England and Peter rang and said he wanted me to write an opera called Nixon In China and I immediately said 'yes', because it was a perfect title.\" The plan was to build a \"heroic\" work around the disgraced president, one that would present him, as Adams has said, as \"a visionary and a poignant character, a man whose vanity and paranoia became an Achilles heel\". The resulting opera is a powerful and enigmatic work, a subtle philosophical comedy propelled along by a score which sweeps gracefully from bloated bombast to wrenching introspection: \"A stirring creation, full of charm and wit, and in the end, beauty,\" wrote John Rockwell in the New York Times. \"Unlike so many operas, this one's likely to last.\" Immediately afterwards, the trio began work on the next collaboration: \"I think it was during a staged rehearsal for Nixon,\" says Goodman, \"someone asked us what we wanted to do next. And without any hesitation, Peter just said: 'The Death of Klinghoffer'. And we all just nodded and said 'Yes, of course.' Everybody in the room thought we were joking.\" From the onset, however, Sellars's chosen material - the 1985 hijacking of the liner Achille Lauro, in which a disabled Jew named Leon Klinghoffer was murdered by Palestinian terrorists - proved far more contentious. \"Even before I had a written a note of the score, I was receiving letters from both sides, from Palestinians and Jews, complaining that I was siding with the other,\" says Adams. The 1991 premiere at the Th\u00e9tre Royal del la Monnaie in Brussels, which was in rehearsal as US planes were dropping smart bombs into ventilator shafts in Baghdad, was almost cancelled. In the US, Klinghoffer was greeted by a firestorm of criticism ranging from opportunism to anti-Semitism. Taken on its own merits, however, the opera is musically superior to Nixon and is considered to have mapped out a new direction for the future of minimalism. Much of the 90s coincided with what might be termed Sellars's Los Angeles period. In 1987, he moved there to take over the artistic directorship of the LA festival. What he found profoundly affected him: \"Instead of the usual image of LA as a cultural wasteland, I found that I was dealing with incredible cultural riches.\" One of the first of his large-scale shows to be affected by the LA ethos was his infamous production of Mozart's The Magic Flute at Glyndebourne in 1990, which produced a vitriolic critical reaction. Set under an LA freeway, with a cast of bums, hippies and an Imelda Marcos lookalike, it precipitated the first outbreak of booing at Glyndebourne and the resignation of its then artistic director, Sir Peter Hall. Sellars shifted the focus of the 1991 LA festival to showcase local artists such as the late Iranian theatre visionary Reza Abdoh as well as community-based work, often in public spaces, 85% of which was free. The next (and because of funding difficulties, the last) festival in 1993 had an even deeper impact: \"It was coming off the LA uprising where people set their own city on fire,\" he says, \"That's a very extreme gesture and needs to be responded to seriously, and the politicians were not capable of that. So, it is up to cultural workers. That was an incredibly powerful experience and all my work for the last 10 years has really been responding to 1992.\" Sellars's post-1992 experiments in transplanting the furious conflicts of the riots into classical works took equally daring steps: a Pell\u00e9as And M\u00e9lisande which set Debussy's work in a beach-front condo, with the disaffected hero lurking in a cavernous no-man's land beneath, and Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress set in an LA maximum security prison. In these works, Sellars's objective is made painfully clear: he is attempting to create a highly politicised, Brechtian model of opera, employing classic works, which, he argues, were highly politically relevant in their day, to comment on contemporary society. In straight theatre it's commonplace. But Sellars feels that the inbuilt \"alienation device\" of opera is even more suited to the task: \"You have critical distance, and at the same time the music is so overwhelming that it involves you completely.\" He feels too that opera audiences are the perfect recipients of his message: \"That's why it's an important place to work. You are addressing the power structure. That's who goes to opera.\" The problem for many is Sellars's apocalyptic anti-Americanism, anti-racial-imperialism, anti-corporate message itself. As his critics gleefully point out, his polemic is often deeply contradictory, sometimes gliding neatly into the slipstream of the original libretto, though quite often jarring discordantly with meaning and sense. However, it is these inherent contradictions that make his work so difficult, unwieldy, and ultimately so interesting, and what raises it above arid politics. Those critics and audiences who insist on finding something more coherent in his work need look no further than the Christian principles that guide his vision. \"New England Christianity was all about social justice, and about what it meant to base one's religious beliefs on an idea of social justice and social equity. Those two things, belief and its social implications, are for me tied together so tightly.\" All of this might be impossibly pious or complacent if it weren't so inextricably married with the more outrageous, controversial, and overstated aspects of Sellars's work. And the controversy also keeps his argument alive, though not always understood: \"A lot of productions are important not because anybody saw them,\" he says, \"but because they heard about them. People's imagination of what happened on stage is even more important than what happened on stage. The most important nights in the theatre were seen by only a tiny fraction of the population and yet they have passed into the history of the world.\" Life at a glance : Peter Mark Sellars Born: September 27 1957, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Education: Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts; Harvard University (BA 1980).
