The Middlesbrough manager, who likes nothing more than a few beers after a game, has chosen to stay at home recently in the wake of some dismal performances. However, he was able to enjoy a few pints again last night after his team ended a miserable sequence which had brought just one win and seven goals from 11 Premiership games. Robson, under intense pressure after last week's collapse against Villa, said: 'It's nice to have three points for a change. I haven't had a happy Saturday night this year, so a few will go down tonight.' Inevitably for a man with his background and reputation, the pressure was intense, although one crucial fact was overlooked as the obituary notices were being prepared: their next opponents were Coventry, the only side without an away win in the Premiership. Quite an oversight. Middlesbrough scored two early goals and held their lead with an ease that disgusted Coventry manager Gordon Strachan, a teetotaller who admitted: 'I don't drink, but I might start now.' Coventry, anticipating a glorious opportunity to achieve that first victory away from Highfield Road, found themselves facing a team made only too aware of their plight. Robson said: 'The players knew it was important for us to win this one, but it was no bigger than any other game.' His players, however, displayed the vigour and invention which has been absent during their dreadful run, with Christian Ziege and Hamilton Ricard notably dis proving the theory that imports are not always the players to have around you in a relegation struggle. The rewards for their energy arrived swiftly as Boro, who have acquired a damaging habit of conceding early goals, scored twice within 20 minutes to equal the number of times they had been on target in their previous six league games. German international Ziege played a significant role in both goals, emphasising that his absence in four of Middlesbrough's last six matches has been costly. His break down the left brought an eighth-minute corner. He took it himself, located Gianluca Festa beyond the far post at the second attempt thanks to a miskick by Carlton Palmer, and the Italian's unconvincing low shot on the turn produced his first goal of the season.

      "body": "<p>Gillingham will become the first team from deepest Kent to play in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup when they play Chelsea this afternoon. Fortunately for football writer Tony Hudd, who has covered Gillingham for 25 years, and photographer Grant Falvey, the men from Kent have been drawn away from home. </p> <p>If the game had been at Priestfield, neither Hudd nor Falvey would have been allowed into the ground. Hudd would have had to rely on his contacts for reports on the game and Falvey would have had to photograph the game from a nearby roof-top. This is because they both work for Medway Today , formerly Kent Today , all of whose employees have been banned from Priestfield by chairman Paul Scally since last March. </p> <p>They are unwelcome not only at the ground but also at the training ground. If Falvey wants to take photos of Iffy Onuora or Roland Edge going through their paces he has to wade through the cabbages, take out the telephoto lens and photograph them from a convenient allotment. </p> <p>It all started with a misquotation. For a while there had been a rift between chairman Scally and the now ex-manager Tony Pulis over the direction the club was going. 'In order to put across his point of view,' explains sports editor Mike Rees, 'Scally took up our suggestion to hold a mid-week press conference. After one of the initial conferences we quoted Scally as saying that Pulis had the easiest job in football. We stuck by our reporter at the time, but it later transpired that we had misquoted Scally and what he had actually said was that Pulis had the best job in football because he only had to deal with the playing side.' </p> <p>By then it was too late. Scally had taken umbrage and banned all employees of Kent Today from the ground even though it was the official newspaper of the club and for the past three years had sponsored the club. Once they realised their mistake, Kent Today published a fulsome front-page apology. 'I've never made such a grand apology in my 30-year career,' says editor Ron Green. It had no effect. </p> <p>The dispute simmered on for the rest of the season. Falvey had to don a wig before retreating to the roof-tops and Hudd watched from the terraces until he was spotted on CCTV with his note-book at the Wycombe game and escorted from the ground. </p> <p>'I think he expected the back-page to be blank,' says Hudd, 'but thanks to my colleagues in the regional press, from Bournemouth to Bolton, we have carried on as before.' Indeed they have. There was a 16-page special supplement on Friday and there will be another one on Monday. </p> <p>The core of the dispute was not so much the mistaking of 'best' for 'easiest' but the ongoing row between Pulis and Scally. 'Tony Pulis was ordered by Paul Scally to stop speaking to us,' says Green. 'But he defied that ban.' </p> <p>At the end of last season, Pulis, who was voted the best manager in Gillingham's history in a Medway Today poll, left the club, but the dispute festers. He is suing Scally for unfair dismissal and the case will soon be heard in the High Court. 'I'll talk about Pulis and Kent Today there,' says Scally. And you can be sure the paper will be there to cover it. </p> <p>After Pulis had gone, 'Peter Taylor rang me,' says Hudd, 'asked about the job and if we would put his name forward as a candidate. We ran two stories saying that he was the man for the job. And when he got it I rang up to congratulate him and he said we have a problem. The chairman says I cannot speak to you.' Nor can the players. </p> <p>Scally counters: 'I don't have a massive rule that they can't. It's just they don't wish to. It's a very negative paper.' </p> <p>The stand-off has become personal.

      "bodyText": "Gillingham will become the first team from deepest Kent to play in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup when they play Chelsea this afternoon. Fortunately for football writer Tony Hudd, who has covered Gillingham for 25 years, and photographer Grant Falvey, the men from Kent have been drawn away from home. If the game had been at Priestfield, neither Hudd nor Falvey would have been allowed into the ground. Hudd would have had to rely on his contacts for reports on the game and Falvey would have had to photograph the game from a nearby roof-top. This is because they both work for Medway Today , formerly Kent Today , all of whose employees have been banned from Priestfield by chairman Paul Scally since last March. They are unwelcome not only at the ground but also at the training ground. If Falvey wants to take photos of Iffy Onuora or Roland Edge going through their paces he has to wade through the cabbages, take out the telephoto lens and photograph them from a convenient allotment. It all started with a misquotation. For a while there had been a rift between chairman Scally and the now ex-manager Tony Pulis over the direction the club was going. 'In order to put across his point of view,' explains sports editor Mike Rees, 'Scally took up our suggestion to hold a mid-week press conference. After one of the initial conferences we quoted Scally as saying that Pulis had the easiest job in football. We stuck by our reporter at the time, but it later transpired that we had misquoted Scally and what he had actually said was that Pulis had the best job in football because he only had to deal with the playing side.' By then it was too late. Scally had taken umbrage and banned all employees of Kent Today from the ground even though it was the official newspaper of the club and for the past three years had sponsored the club. Once they realised their mistake, Kent Today published a fulsome front-page apology. 'I've never made such a grand apology in my 30-year career,' says editor Ron Green. It had no effect. The dispute simmered on for the rest of the season. Falvey had to don a wig before retreating to the roof-tops and Hudd watched from the terraces until he was spotted on CCTV with his note-book at the Wycombe game and escorted from the ground. 'I think he expected the back-page to be blank,' says Hudd, 'but thanks to my colleagues in the regional press, from Bournemouth to Bolton, we have carried on as before.' Indeed they have. There was a 16-page special supplement on Friday and there will be another one on Monday. The core of the dispute was not so much the mistaking of 'best' for 'easiest' but the ongoing row between Pulis and Scally. 'Tony Pulis was ordered by Paul Scally to stop speaking to us,' says Green. 'But he defied that ban.' At the end of last season, Pulis, who was voted the best manager in Gillingham's history in a Medway Today poll, left the club, but the dispute festers. He is suing Scally for unfair dismissal and the case will soon be heard in the High Court. 'I'll talk about Pulis and Kent Today there,' says Scally. And you can be sure the paper will be there to cover it. After Pulis had gone, 'Peter Taylor rang me,' says Hudd, 'asked about the job and if we would put his name forward as a candidate. We ran two stories saying that he was the man for the job. And when he got it I rang up to congratulate him and he said we have a problem. The chairman says I cannot speak to you.' Nor can the players. Scally counters: 'I don't have a massive rule that they can't. It's just they don't wish to. It's a very negative paper.' The stand-off has become personal. Paul Scally has used his A Few Words From the Chairman column to rail against his opponents. 'They look for every excuse to have a dig, to stick the knife in, but they are always nice to your face. Pretenders are dangerous, twisted people and are not to be trusted_ I am on their case and in due course I will name them and then our supporters will realise what I have been up against.' Medway Today , meanwhile, has gone about its business. They have recently run a story about Scally's wife being charged with possession of class A drugs. 'It was a legitimate news story,' says Green. 'If it had been my wife I'd expect to read about it.' There has been another story about Scally's wife being admitted to hospital with cuts to her wrists. Both sides want the club to succeed. There are 250,000 people in the Medway towns, one and a half million in Kent, and only one football club. Both newspaper and chairman would benefit if Gillingham were promoted and became a focus for the regeneration of the area. Despite the ban, Medway Today's circulation has not suffered. 'We have continued to provide first-class coverage,' said Green. 'Everyone with a story comes to us and the fans realise they get more than just the PR version.' Whatever the fate of the club, the grudge is unlikely to end. 'All he has to say is welcome back,' says Green.

      "body": "<p>Gary Speed must have wondered more than once just what he had let himself in for by joining Newcastle United.

A third cup final appearance in successive years? Can it really be on? </p> <p>'We really think it can be done and that we are in better shape than in '98 or '99,' he said. 'When Bobby Robson arrived last year it was like a breath of fresh air, but we've had a honeymoon period with him and that is now over. </p> <p>'What we have to do now is carry on the good work beyond that honeymoon. We showed a standard in the home win against Manchester United that should be our yardstick. That's what we have to try to reproduce. </p> <p>'One of our problems has been away form. We've had some disappointing results and the Tranmere game is away so we can take absolutely nothing for granted. They have shown just how capable they are against Premiership opposition in getting this far in the FA Cup and to Wembley in the Worthington Cup.' </p> <p>Speed, now 30, must still be catching his breath at events on Tyneside. He was signed by 'living legend' Kenny Dalglish but, although his new side made it to Wembley in his first season, there was no fairy-tale ending - a dire 2-0 defeat and then Dalglish was gone just months after an unsavoury episode when two senior directors' indiscretions were splashed across a Sunday tabloid. </p> <p>In came Ruud Gullit - and a year later out he went after another FA Cup final collapse, a bust-up with his captain, Alan Shearer, and a disastrous start to the current league campaign. 'Things like that are never ideal and there always seemed to be some sort of upheaval,' said Speed. 'Good sides need stability and continuity and hopefully we have that now.' </p> <p>Well chosen words, as Robson was putting the finishing touches to a new rolling contract as we spoke. His affect on Speed and company has been all too clear and profound. But if a long cup run brings on feelings of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, so does today's clash with Tranmere - they were one of Newcastle's victims during the Wembley run two years ago. </p> <p>'It will be tougher this time,' concedes Speed. 'It's on their patch which, with respect, isn't the best playing surface. It's a difficult place to get a result. I know a lot about Tranmere because I come from just the other side of the Wirral in North Wales and I used to look out for Tranmere's results. ' </p> <p>Another Newcastle player who knows just what to expect on Merseyside is Duncan Ferguson, reunited with Speed at Newcastle after a successful spell at Goodison. Was Speed consulted by Gullit before the striker was signed? 'Absolutely not, I had no idea,' he recalls. </p> <p>'We played at Everton on a Monday night last season and someone said to me as we were leaving, \"They're doing the deal, Duncan's signing for you lot.\" That was that and he joined the next day. 'Up front he's great together with Alan Shearer, and they get on really well off the pitch too. There's no doubt Alan is a better player with Duncan in the side. </p> <p>'We do feel that there is an affinity with the FA Cup. The fans deserve for us to do well. They are absolutely fantastic and are on top form whatever we do on the pitch and, yes, there is a feeling that we can make it three finals in a row. </p> <p>'We are better prepared and more consistent than in any other year.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>The sort of player indiscipline that has undermined the image of the Premiership could also be seen yesterday in the Nationwide League. </p> <p>The most disturbing flashpoint was at Nottingham Forest. The trouble began with the first goal in Forest's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace - from an Alan Rogers free-kick - which Palace claimed should have been disallowed for a foul on their goalkeeper Steve Mautone. This was followed by a reckless lunge by Forest striker Marlon Hare wood on Palace's captain, Simon Rodger - and a flare-up involving several players.</p> <p>But the referee decided to brandish only a yellow card, to Harweood and also to Palace's Hayden Mullins for retaliating.</p> <p>One player shown the red card was West Brom's Richard Sneekes, for an elbow on Sheffield United's Michael Brown. West Brom, a goal down at the time, lost 6-0, with Marcus Bent scoring a hat-trick.</p> <p>That took his total to 13 since his move to United from Port Vale in October, and United's manager, Neil Warnock, said: 'He is only 21, and for me, there is no limit to what he could achieve.' Warnock revealed that before handing Bent the match ball, he wrote on it: 'If you want to listen to me, you will be the best.'</p> <p>Perhaps Warnock can give the Fulham strikers some advice. True, Fulham, with only three goals from their previous 11 matches, improved their record with a 2-0 win over Walsall. But the distinction of getting their first goals of the year in open play went to full-back Terry Phelan, Fulham's recent free transfer from Everton, and midfielder Lee Clark.</p> <p>Barnsley, the First Division's leading scorers, owed their 1-1 draw against QPR to a last-minute penalty by Craig Hignett.

      "bodyText": "The sort of player indiscipline that has undermined the image of the Premiership could also be seen yesterday in the Nationwide League. The most disturbing flashpoint was at Nottingham Forest. The trouble began with the first goal in Forest's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace - from an Alan Rogers free-kick - which Palace claimed should have been disallowed for a foul on their goalkeeper Steve Mautone. This was followed by a reckless lunge by Forest striker Marlon Hare wood on Palace's captain, Simon Rodger - and a flare-up involving several players. But the referee decided to brandish only a yellow card, to Harweood and also to Palace's Hayden Mullins for retaliating. One player shown the red card was West Brom's Richard Sneekes, for an elbow on Sheffield United's Michael Brown. West Brom, a goal down at the time, lost 6-0, with Marcus Bent scoring a hat-trick. That took his total to 13 since his move to United from Port Vale in October, and United's manager, Neil Warnock, said: 'He is only 21, and for me, there is no limit to what he could achieve.' Warnock revealed that before handing Bent the match ball, he wrote on it: 'If you want to listen to me, you will be the best.' Perhaps Warnock can give the Fulham strikers some advice. True, Fulham, with only three goals from their previous 11 matches, improved their record with a 2-0 win over Walsall. But the distinction of getting their first goals of the year in open play went to full-back Terry Phelan, Fulham's recent free transfer from Everton, and midfielder Lee Clark. Barnsley, the First Division's leading scorers, owed their 1-1 draw against QPR to a last-minute penalty by Craig Hignett. Not the best of results for the home team, but their fans can hardly complain, not least because QPR twice hit the woodwork. Moreoever, Barnsley have now gone 41 matches without subjecting their followers to a goalless draw. Another last-minute scorer was Ipswich's Jermaine Wright, against his previous club, Crewe. It gave Ipswich a 2-1 win, and lifted then into second place. 'I might have guessed that Wright would get that goal,' said Crewe manager Dario Gradi. 'He couldn't score for us.' As far as Burnley's rivals are concerned, the team who can most afford to ignore Ian Wright's presence at Turf Moor are Bristol Rovers. They, of course, have the Second Division's leading scoring duo in Jason Roberts and Jamie Cureton. 'They are great mates off the field, and that does help them,' says Rovers' coach Garry Thompson, who was once no mean striker himself. 'The main thing they have had to improve upon is their team awareness. We keep reminding them that by not always trying to do things off their own bat, they are going to get better chances.' They got the message at Luton, where they each scored twice to give Rovers a 4-1 win and bring their joint total for the season to 36.",

From having fewer than quarter of a million subscribers in June last year, the figure soared to more than half a million before Christmas. </p> <p>They have already infuriated Sky by not allowing them to show Champions League matches, while they have access to the three Sky Sports channels. </p> <p>Since reporting in this column a week ago that Sky will have little spare cash left if they bid successfully to retain live rights to Premiership football, news reaches me that already extraordinary measures are being taken to trim costs at the satellite station's Isleworth super-shed. </p> <p>The thrift offensive includes a directive from on high that departmental newspaper bills must be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated. Falling into the latter category is the team who produce Hold the Back Page . Guess you'll have to buy your own, guys. </p> <p>Sky's desperation to hang on to the contract to show live matches was again demonstrated at last week's meeting of club chairmen. The satellite broadcaster had managed to persuade one of the chairmen to float the idea of an extension to Sky's present contract rather than put it out to tender. </p> <p>Their proposition was that if the League agreed to give them a further two years, they would hand over a sum of close to \u00a31 billion, part of which would be brought forward and put into the pot for next season, the last of the present contract. </p> <p>They argued that the League were not really in a position to do a wider deal based on the new TV technology because this technology was not yet far enough advanced. </p> <p>I understand that Sky's proposal was dismissed out of hand and that their manoeuvring did not suit the taste of all the chairmen seated around the table.</p>",

The Masters Series tennis, formerly known as the Super Nine, that ONdigital will show, may not be the biggest catch pulled from the rights pool, but it does represent further evidence that they have the money and confidence to become a multi-sports operation. They are also due to announce shortly that they are to introduce a sports-dedicated channel. ONdigital, jointly owned by the plutocrats of ITV, Carlton and Granada, launched in November 1998 and pulled off a major coup when they acquired live rights to this season's Champions League football. From having fewer than quarter of a million subscribers in June last year, the figure soared to more than half a million before Christmas. They have already infuriated Sky by not allowing them to show Champions League matches, while they have access to the three Sky Sports channels. Since reporting in this column a week ago that Sky will have little spare cash left if they bid successfully to retain live rights to Premiership football, news reaches me that already extraordinary measures are being taken to trim costs at the satellite station's Isleworth super-shed. The thrift offensive includes a directive from on high that departmental newspaper bills must be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated. Falling into the latter category is the team who produce Hold the Back Page . Guess you'll have to buy your own, guys. Sky's desperation to hang on to the contract to show live matches was again demonstrated at last week's meeting of club chairmen. The satellite broadcaster had managed to persuade one of the chairmen to float the idea of an extension to Sky's present contract rather than put it out to tender. Their proposition was that if the League agreed to give them a further two years, they would hand over a sum of close to \u00a31 billion, part of which would be brought forward and put into the pot for next season, the last of the present contract. They argued that the League were not really in a position to do a wider deal based on the new TV technology because this technology was not yet far enough advanced. I understand that Sky's proposal was dismissed out of hand and that their manoeuvring did not suit the taste of all the chairmen seated around the table.",

The FA is to ask both the Premier and Football Leagues to adopt the measure and they will also consider using it in the FA Cup. The SFA will do likewise north of the border. </p> <p>The International Board, which comprises the four British associations and the world governing body Fifa, yesterday gave the go-ahead at their meeting at Cliveden House in Berkshire for the FA and SFA to extend the experiment, which has been used this season in the Auto Windscreens Trophy, to the higher echelons of the game in Britain with a view to implementing it worldwide. </p> <p>The FA will consider at a board meeting on Tuesday whether it should apply to the FA Cup and will then meet the Premier League and Football League to see if it is feasible to start next season. 'So far they have been very positive and supportive about it,' said Adam Crozier, the FA's chief executive. </p> <p>The rule works so that if a player is given a yellow card for dissent or kicking the ball away after conceding a free kick, the referee can advance the ball 10 yards to punish the offending team. If the action takes the ball into the penalty area, it will remain a free kick on the edge of the 18-yard line, either direct or indirect in accordance with the original offence. </p> <p>Statistics from the Auto Windscreens Trophy this season show that in 40 games, there have been 850 free kicks and 16 'advancements'. The FA say that its real value is as a deterrent to bad behaviour, however. One referee reported that 'dissent was non-existent 30 metres from goal,' another that players 'ran away like scalded cats'. </p> <p>What may stop the FA adopting the measure in the Cup is that they want to see the experiment across a whole league and a whole season rather than in isolated matches. It could well be also that the Premiership is reluctant to comply yet, given that several of their teams will be playing in Europe and will thus have to adapt from midweek to weekends. </p> <p>Indeed the reservations of the Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson might hold some sway. 'I don't think there is a great need for a 10-yard rule but it would at least be instant and less disruptive than a sin bin,' he says. </p> <p>It is more likely that the Football League will play ball. Their chief executive John McKeown says they have been 'delighted' to try out the idea and adds: 'As a body we would have no qualms about seeing it used more widely in football.' At the very least, the Worthington Cup next season can be expected to implement the rule, which is also likely to be used at the World Under-20 Championship in Argentina in 2001. </p> <p>The move comes at the end of a week which has seen the English game in the dock as a result of indiscipline on and off the field, a week which has emphasised to the FA the need to seek solutions through the rules. </p> <p>'We have have an issue to confront,' Crozier admits. 'Football is the national game and as such part of everyone's lives. We believe it has an effect on how everyone behaves. This is something we must look at right through the game. </p> <p>'We will be looking at the area of collective intimidation of officials. However scary that is in a Premier League game in a full stadium, it is 10 times scarier when you are on your own refereeing a game in a park on a Sunday morning. That's why we have issued very clear warnings about this behaviour to referees and clubs through all levels of the game. </p> <p>'There is a real need for players to realise they are role models. Players, managers and clubs as employers all have a part to play in spreading this message and it goes for us at the FA, the Premier League and the Football League in how to administer the game. We can say we are working as one.' </p> <p>Crozier believes that new agreement among all involved in the game is needed. 'We have to tackle the issue in the short term,' he says. 'For all parties - clubs, players, managers and referees - signing up to a new code of conduct is the long-term aim.' </p> <p>It also emerged at Cliveden yesterday that the FA, on the International Board's behalf, are to experiment with goal-line technology in an attempt to avert controversy of the sort seen last Sunday in the African Nations Cup final when Victor Ikpeba's penalty for Nigeria was disallowed even though it had clearly crossed the line. The referee, linesman and even the player thought the ball had not crossed the line when it bounced down off the bar, but it was nearly a foot over. </p> <p>Rather than use cameras, which they believe will slow the game, however, the FA are in talks with companies to produce, for use in the professional game only, a beam in the goal that when broken will send a message to the referee's earpiece. Initially, experiments will be conducted on training grounds rather than in matches. With players' bodies in the goalmouth as well as a ball, there are many technological difficulties to overcome. </p> <p>The IB also increased the powers of assistant referees, enabling them to give penalty kicks and to enter the field of play to help referees get walls back at free kicks. In addition, red cards can now be shown for offensives gestures as well as bad language. For next season, referees will also have to enforce a six-second limit on goalkeepers holding the ball. </p> <p>Other rule changes agreed by the IB yesterday were the unlimited use of substitutes in friendly internationals and a change to penalty shoot-outs. If a team has had players sent off, the opposition will be allowed to drop that number of its own players to even up the sides. It prevents, say, a nine-man team having an advantage should the shoot-out go to 10 kicks each by using its best kicker twice with the opposition being down to its worst. The IB has also banned advertisements from the playing surface. </p> <p>While the Fifa president Sepp Blatter was happy with the FA's role in the 10-yard rule yesterday, he voiced his concern about the recent letters sent to referees asking them to show more leniency. The Premier League thought there had been too many yellow cards at a time when Fifa was trying to get a uniformity in officiating. His organisation would, he said, be investigating. </p> <p>'The referees have to fulfil their duty and should not be put under pressure from any outside organisation,' he said, adding his support for professional referees. 'The players have a duty to play, the referee to direct the game.

      "byline": "David Hills",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Collina: 'Men, not machines' </p> <p>The prospect of imminent change in refereeing techniques - from video evidence to second officials - may have moved closer, but the world's most renowned referee is still having none of it. 'A match should be refereed by men, not by machines,' warned Italian icon Pierluigi Collina (right) last week, after being forced to attend a training course in Valletta following a string of 'impossible' (Sergio Cragnotti), 'incredible' (Sven Goran Eriksson), 'I don't understand' (Fabio Capello), 'sick' (Alberto Malesani), 'pissed' (Marcello Lippi) decisions. Pressure is growing for the introduction of artificial aids, and for a second official - but Collina is unconvinced. 'Change would lead to many new problems,' he says. 'Bad personal chemistry between two officials, for instance, or a lack of concentration from one official when the play is not in his sector... And as for machines - even with a multitude of cameras, the right decision is sometimes impossible to make.' </p> <p>Now the president of the European commission of refereeing, Joseph Mifsud, has gone further, defending refereeing errors as integral to good football. 'Errors are part of the game and when football is perfect, it will be dead. When football becomes a computer game, it will no longer exist.' So for now, for Collina, the weekly Serie A exchange of cold stares and cold shoulders will go on. 'I'm so cross with him,' said Marcello Lippi after Collina denied Inter a clear penalty earlier this month. 'Did you see what he did? And there are people who say we're friends.' </p> <p><strong> McGhee, Maresca and Man U</strong></p> <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers are still suffering the hangover of Mark McGhee's time in charge, 15 months after he left the club. Club officials, currently imposing cost-cutting measures at Molineux, discovered last week that McGhee's refusal to deal with players' agents during his spell in charge cost the club at least \u00a34.5m. The figure relates to young Italian Enzo Maresca (left), who McGhee, it turns out, rejected in 1998. Maresca's agent, former Wolves man Mel Eves, took him instead to neighbours West Brom, who then sold him on to Juventus for \u00a34.5m last month. 'I wasn't being disloyal,' says Eves, 'Mark just wouldn't deal with agents.' </p> <p> And the news for Wolves can only get worse. Last week, Maresca starred for Italy's under-20 side, scoring twice in their 4-0 win over Slovenia. He's now in line for rapid promotion to the senior side. 'He's got quality, ability and he's just brilliant,' said manager Claudio Gentile in Gazzetta dello Sport . 'He was the focus of our team.' </p> <p>Maresca, who left home when he was 11 to sign for Milan, has seen his valuation rocket since leaving the Hawthorns - and if he realises his ambition of moving back to England, Wolves will be kicking themselves harder still.

      "bodyText": "Collina: 'Men, not machines' The prospect of imminent change in refereeing techniques - from video evidence to second officials - may have moved closer, but the world's most renowned referee is still having none of it. 'A match should be refereed by men, not by machines,' warned Italian icon Pierluigi Collina (right) last week, after being forced to attend a training course in Valletta following a string of 'impossible' (Sergio Cragnotti), 'incredible' (Sven Goran Eriksson), 'I don't understand' (Fabio Capello), 'sick' (Alberto Malesani), 'pissed' (Marcello Lippi) decisions. Pressure is growing for the introduction of artificial aids, and for a second official - but Collina is unconvinced. 'Change would lead to many new problems,' he says. 'Bad personal chemistry between two officials, for instance, or a lack of concentration from one official when the play is not in his sector... And as for machines - even with a multitude of cameras, the right decision is sometimes impossible to make.' Now the president of the European commission of refereeing, Joseph Mifsud, has gone further, defending refereeing errors as integral to good football. 'Errors are part of the game and when football is perfect, it will be dead. When football becomes a computer game, it will no longer exist.' So for now, for Collina, the weekly Serie A exchange of cold stares and cold shoulders will go on. 'I'm so cross with him,' said Marcello Lippi after Collina denied Inter a clear penalty earlier this month. 'Did you see what he did? And there are people who say we're friends.' McGhee, Maresca and Man U Wolverhampton Wanderers are still suffering the hangover of Mark McGhee's time in charge, 15 months after he left the club. Club officials, currently imposing cost-cutting measures at Molineux, discovered last week that McGhee's refusal to deal with players' agents during his spell in charge cost the club at least \u00a34.5m. The figure relates to young Italian Enzo Maresca (left), who McGhee, it turns out, rejected in 1998. Maresca's agent, former Wolves man Mel Eves, took him instead to neighbours West Brom, who then sold him on to Juventus for \u00a34.5m last month. 'I wasn't being disloyal,' says Eves, 'Mark just wouldn't deal with agents.' And the news for Wolves can only get worse. Last week, Maresca starred for Italy's under-20 side, scoring twice in their 4-0 win over Slovenia. He's now in line for rapid promotion to the senior side. 'He's got quality, ability and he's just brilliant,' said manager Claudio Gentile in Gazzetta dello Sport . 'He was the focus of our team.' Maresca, who left home when he was 11 to sign for Milan, has seen his valuation rocket since leaving the Hawthorns - and if he realises his ambition of moving back to England, Wolves will be kicking themselves harder still. 'I have grown up thinking I would like to play like David Beckham, and admiring his team Manchester United,' says Enzo. 'They were the ones who first turned my mind to the idea of playing football in England. To think that one day I might play at Old Trafford is a great inspiration.'

      "body": "<p>Somewhere at the bottom of a pile of scouts and managers is a 23-year-old Dutchman named Ruud van Nistelrooy. With his flailing limbs, floppy dark hair and prominent teeth he resembles the cartoon character Goofy. He is the most prolific goalscorer in Europe, who plans to move to England this summer for the highest transfer fee ever paid by a Premier League club. </p> <p>His is an unusual story. Almost every great Dutch footballer joins Ajax soon after he can walk, buys his first pair of sunglasses aged seven, and then moves to Italy. But Van Nistelrooy, born on the same day as Patrick Kluivert on 1 July 1976, is a hick from the sticks. He grew up in a village in the Catholic south of Holland, a whole hour's drive from Amsterdam, distinctly outside the footballing establishment. </p> <p>As a boy in his village team, he played sweeper. He turned pro at little Den Bosch, playing as a 'shadow striker' behind the forward line. By the summer of 1995, when Kluivert had scored the winning goal in a Champions League final, Van Nistelrooy had scored three goals in 17 games for Den Bosch. </p> <p>Slowly he got better. In 1997, he won himself a transfer to Heerenveen, where he became a real striker. A year later Bobby Robson paid \u00a34.7 million (much too much, people said) to bring him to PSV Eindhoven. It was there that either Robson's legendary tactical brilliance or some chemical reaction turned Van Nistelrooy into the player he is today - 31 league goals in his first year at PSV, and 27 in 22 games so far this season. </p> <p>However, being the best player in the Dutch league is a bit like being the tallest pygmy in the tribe. 'Just how good is he?' was the question in the minds of the representatives of most of the biggest clubs in Europe who flew to Eindhoven 10 days ago to watch PSV against Ajax. Despite his hat-trick, Van Nistelrooy failed to settle the question. Afterwards he said he had not played particularly well. </p> <p>But he did show that he is not your typical Dutch striker, all touch and dribble. He possesses a secure technique, but is no Kluivert and Bergkamp. He scores goals because he has a good touch and is taller (6ft 3in), faster and more passionate than anyone else. He also has a bullet shot. In style he is rather like Gabriel Batistuta. Hurling himself around, crossing himself after goals, he could be a Latin-American striker. This extends to a penchant for diving considered in Holland as a terrible German sin. </p> <p>Van Nistelrooy has remained calm. 'Everyone is going crazy, except Ruud,' says his agent Rodger Linse. </p> <p>In nine appearances for Holland, he has scored just once, and has sometimes looked flummoxed and off the pace. He has said his place is on the Dutch bench behind Kluivert and Bergkamp, and he obsessively watches a video of his hero, Marco Van Basten. Missing out on Ajax means that he has matured more slowly than these three. That explains why he wants to move to England. </p> <p>Van Nistelrooy knows the Italian league is the best. He wants to get there eventually. But he worries that he is not good enough yet. Rather than going straight to Serie A, he wants to shift from the slow lane of Dutch football to the middle lane of the Premiership. </p> <p>Linse refuses to endorse this explanation, but points out that in 1997 Van Nistelrooy chose to join Heerenveen rather than a bigger club. 'It was a feeling, a very conscious choice,' says Linse. Similarly, Van Nistelrooy now has 'a feeling' that England is right for him. The very lucky Linse claims he has yet to speak to any clubs. </p> <p>However, he says his charge will be joining one of England's 'classical greats, a club with a name, with a future, with a past'. He cites Arsenal, Manchester United or Chelsea as examples. Someone very close to the player says he won't be joining Leeds, a club apparently not considered a 'classical great'. </p> <p>Wherever he goes, he will have made a considered choice. That is why he is furious with PSV for hiring the Italian agent Giovanni Branchini to recommend the size of the transfer fee. PSV are determined that they will not make the same mistake they did with Ronaldo, whom they merrily sold to Barcelona for \u00a310 million in 1996 only to watch Barcelona sell him on for nearly twice that a year later. They are hoping to get \u00a325 million for Van Nistelrooy and the bidding seems to have begun at \u00a315 million. </p> <p>Van Nistelrooy insists that he alone will decide where he goes. The lucky club will get a friendly man who loves football and seems to have found the secret of perpetual goalscoring. The paradox is that the better he does in England, the sooner he could be off to Italy.</p>",

An Observer investigation has discovered that the club has placed responsibility for the sales - reckoned to be worth up to \u00a34 million on the transfer market - with a company that has direct links with the Ferguson family. </p> <p>Sir Alex's son Jason is on the payroll of the Manchester-based sports agency, L'attitude. Jason's wife is listed as one of its four main shareholders. Concluding any transfer would earn the company commission and leave Sir Alex open to charges of allowing the world's biggest club to enrich his family. In addition to the family ties, it can be disclosed that one of L'attitude's directors is a Ferguson old boy - signed and then rejected by the manager - who was also an organiser for Ferguson's recent testimonial year. </p> <p>Details of L'attitude's available United players have been circulated in recent weeks to managers of several other Premier and Nationwide League clubs. Michael Clegg and Jonathan Greening - both members of United's European Cup winning squad in Barcelona last May - feature on the transfer list. Also included are Michael Twiss, who has played several first-team games, England youth international Richard Wellens, Paul Wheatcroft, Dominic Shelley, Steven Rose, Ian Fitzpatrick and Steven Cosgrave. </p> <p>The letters, referring to one or more of the footballers, were sent on L'attitude-headed paper, topped off with the company's logo. Those clubs expressing an interest in setting up a deal were instructed to contact either Jason Ferguson or one of the firm's directors, Kieran Toal, for further information. According to the letters, L'attitude is 'authorised in accordance with Fifa regulations'. </p> <p>Toal was a midfield prospect, a member of United's set-up in the early 1990s when the current first-team stars such as David Beckham, Paul Scholes and brothers Phil and Gary Neville were starting to shine in the club's junior ranks. But Toal did not emulate his peers and was released by Ferguson. </p> <p>He then studied law and was called to the bar in March 1998. Six months previously, he had helped found L'attitude and is one of three directors, each of whom hold a 30 per cent stake in the company. Documents lodged at Companies House show that the remaining 10 per cent is registered in the name of Tania Ferguson - Jason's wife and Sir Alex's daughter-in-law. </p> <p>Mr Toal refused to confirm that his firm had secured the potentially lucrative contract to sell some of 'Fergie's Fledglings'. 'Our policy is that if we have any involvement with certain players, we don't really speak about it. I would urge you to contact the club. If we deal with United, we wouldn't really comment.' </p> <p>Attempts to uncover whether Manchester United knew about the Ferguson family connection before they gave L'attitude the mandate to work on their behalf were met with silence. Sir Alex produced a blunt 'No comment.' His chairman, Martin Edwards, was said to be on holiday until tomorrow. However an official at Old Trafford did admit that 'anything to do with young players is the responsibility of the manager'. </p> <p>Tottenham Hotspur, Leicester City and Newcastle United are among those clubs said to be interested in securing the services of the \u00a3750,000-rated Greening.

'There are similar places in America, but you won't find anywhere in Europe with comparable facilities.' Those facilities include three championship golf courses, a 22-court tennis centre (both of which regularly host professional events) and an eight-pitch football centre, as well as watersports, swimming pools and a gym, all spread out over 1,500 picturesque acres built on a long, thin strip that separates the Mediterranean from Mar Menor, a vast saltwater lake. The name La Manga means 'sleeve' for this reason. </p> <p>The resort was created in 1972, with the football centre added in 1988 in conjunction with the Norwegian football association. 'The majority of our business is with Scandinavian clubs,' says Coles. 'They often need somewhere to train between January and Easter, particularly if they're still involved in European competition.' Over 250 football clubs have stayed there in the past 12 years, including the England squad in 1998, and the Spanish national side just two weeks ago. It was in the piano bar of one of the resort's two hotels that Stan Collymore's eyes calamitously settled upon a fire extinguisher. </p> <p>'With the Scandinavian clubs we've had zero problems,' Coles says, 'although until this week every club has behaved much as you would expect a group of well-paid professionals to behave. It's just this one particular club and one particular player - although the others didn't exactly have their halos on.' </p> <p>But British clubs can rest assured - they are still welcome to visit La Manga and partake in its splendid facilities. Except, of course, Leicester City, who are no longer welcome.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Leicester City's trip to their Spanish training camp was never going to be run-of-the-mill: the resort, La Manga in south-east Spain, is an oasis of sporting exclusivity a million miles from Leicester's Beaver Drive training ground. 'We're probably unique in Europe,' says Tony Coles, the resort's managing director and an Englishman himself. 'There are similar places in America, but you won't find anywhere in Europe with comparable facilities.' Those facilities include three championship golf courses, a 22-court tennis centre (both of which regularly host professional events) and an eight-pitch football centre, as well as watersports, swimming pools and a gym, all spread out over 1,500 picturesque acres built on a long, thin strip that separates the Mediterranean from Mar Menor, a vast saltwater lake. The name La Manga means 'sleeve' for this reason. The resort was created in 1972, with the football centre added in 1988 in conjunction with the Norwegian football association. 'The majority of our business is with Scandinavian clubs,' says Coles. 'They often need somewhere to train between January and Easter, particularly if they're still involved in European competition.' Over 250 football clubs have stayed there in the past 12 years, including the England squad in 1998, and the Spanish national side just two weeks ago. It was in the piano bar of one of the resort's two hotels that Stan Collymore's eyes calamitously settled upon a fire extinguisher. 'With the Scandinavian clubs we've had zero problems,' Coles says, 'although until this week every club has behaved much as you would expect a group of well-paid professionals to behave. It's just this one particular club and one particular player - although the others didn't exactly have their halos on.' But British clubs can rest assured - they are still welcome to visit La Manga and partake in its splendid facilities. Except, of course, Leicester City, who are no longer welcome.",

      "body": "<p>David Beckham will be assuming a central role for England against Argentina on Wednesday, and hopefully lasting longer than the 45 minutes he managed last time against the same opponents as Kevin Keegan looks to fill his creative void in midfield. </p> <p>Keegan will use two orthodox wide players, probably Kieron Dyer on the right and Jason Wilcox on the left, to see if he can afford to sacrifice Beckham's crossing ability, and if the experiment goes well England's shape for Euro 2000 could be built around a player the manager describes as 'a model professional'. </p> <p>This assessment overlooks the minor misdemeanour in St Etienne and the dismissal in Brazil last month that arguably ushered in the present hysteria over petulance on the pitch, not to mention the fact that Beckham was prominent among those hectoring Steven Lodge at Newcastle last week. But you know what Keegan means. Beckham might be highly strung, but he is practically a choirboy compared to Dennis Wise, Paul Gascoigne, Stan Collymore and the rest of the mayhem makers Keegan found himself considering. </p> <p>So, after patiently, if not all that convincingly, explaining why Wise was still in the squad, Keegan was flabbergasted at the suggestion he might leave Beckham out of the Argentina game, just to be on the safe side and prevent any carry-over from France 98. 'There's absolutely no way I would leave Becks out,' he said. 'He's a key player, and if he is fit he will definitely play. What happened last time against Argentina is in the past, David has answered all the questions, and his performances since have been excellent. I know he can play better for England, there's a lot of improvement in him still, but he's a wonderful player and I'm a massive fan of his. I'd like to see how he goes in a central role too. In the last match against Scotland he ended up playing at right back, because of the way the game went, and that's a waste. I can't allow that to happen again, for the team, not for David Beckham, he'll do it willingly.' </p> <p>Keegan's plans are subject to his latest squad coming through the weekend's fixtures unscathed, and when he says he will wait and see who turns up before deciding whether to play 4-4-2 or 3-5-2 one can appreciate how little is certain at this stage. Ever the optimist though, Keegan believes that by shifting the permutations slightly he might one day happen on the magic formula. 'Why look at it negatively?' he asked. 'We might just drop a little gem in there and think \"Wow\". You could be looking at Steven Gerrard or Keiron Dyer, or possibly Jason Wilcox or Stephen Froggatt. You just don't know until you try.' </p> <p>Or perhaps you do. Keegan did not mention Wise among his potential little gems, despite consistent form above that of the other names. The suspicion is growing that he has no intention of using the Chelsea player, but kept him in the squad because to leave him out would have been politically difficult, involving a pre-judgment of guilt over the brawl in the Stamford Bridge tunnel. Had Keegan gone down that path, he would have also had to take a view on the Leeds players facing police charges, and whoever might be involved in a brawl this week. In the current climate, his already limited options could be decimated by the time Euro 2000 comes around. If Keegan the former idealist sounded like a tired old pragmatist when passing the buck for punishment to the FA and somewhat ridiculously excusing English behaviour on the grounds that fights are breaking out all over the world, it's because that's what he is. His original moral stance on Ben Thatcher's non-selection, after his elbow on Nicky Summerbee, might have been admirable, but it must have occurred to Keegan shortly afterwards that he could only maintain a consistent disciplinary line at the expense of losing half his players. So Wise stays, until the FA decide otherwise. </p> <p>'The rules are there and the punishment is there,' Keegan said. 'If a player gets sent off or earns a suspension he puts himself out of contention and could end up losing his place in the England team to someone else. I don't see why a manager needs to interfere with Fifa's disciplinary procedures, or Uefa's or the FA's. Managers want their players to realise where they draw the line, but you have to accept, especially if you have been a player yourself, that sometimes on the pitch certain things happen on the spur of the moment.' </p> <p>And in the tunnel, outside the nightclub in Leeds, inside the nightclub in La Manga, the list is almost endless. But not all of these incidents can be laid at Keegan's door, even if England are the most undisciplined team in the country in terms of dismissals over their past 12 games. The disciplinary issue may yet explode in the manager's face, however, if Wednesday's friendly conforms to the pattern of controversial meetings between England and Argentina, particularly if those dastardly Latins get up to their usual provocative tricks. If Keegan is concerned that this might be a bad time to be playing a volatile team like Argentina, he hides it well. 'I don't go into games worrying about discipline, I worry about the performance,' he said. </p> <p> Anyone who witnessed the last game against Scotland would have to admit this may be an even more pressing priority. More alarming still, of the four games Keegan has to fine-tune his system before Euro 2000, only the first two will be meaningful for selection purposes, and there is a three-month gap between Wednesday's match and the visit of Brazil on 27 May. This week's game, Keegan has confirmed, will be his last chance to experiment. Brazil will be used to give his first-choice side a pre-tournament outing. The Ukraine game four days later was originally to have served that purpose, but Wembley's last international will now be lucky to see anything like a full-strength side due to an obligation on Keegan to name his final 22 for Euro 2000 the same evening.</p>",

It is where the contest will be of most interest to me personally, because all the players concerned are strong characters - and none more so than United's David Beckham. In terms of players to watch, Beckham, for me the best player in England over the last 18 months, fits the bill perfectly. </p> <p>While I would not dream of comparing myself with him as a player, I can relate to him in some ways. Like him, I operated on the right side of midfield, a role that I did not like. It was ok when I was getting a lot of the ball, but generally, I wanted to be in the thick of the action in the centre.

However, his present role does not preclude him from popping into a more influential play-making position - which he does - and one also has to bear in mind, of course, that his crossing is one of the most potent attacking weapons in the game. </p> <p>My crossing was not bad, but unlike him, I needed to be yards clear of the full-back before I could get it over. Because of his short backlift, he does not need that space. </p> <p>Quite apart from his technical ability, I also admire the element of 'devil' in him - the 'devil' that drives him to make a 40-yard run to get in a tackle and also to stand up for himself and not be intimidated. His sendings-off in the 1998 World Cup finals, and the World Club Championship - two of the occasions when we have witnessed the down-side of that characteristic - have led many to question his temperament. But against that, I would point out that many players subjected to the stick Beckham has taken since that red card against Argentina would have folded. </p> <p>There is no doubt he gets more abuse from opposing supporters than any other player. The extent to which he has answered it through his performances has been remarkable. To varying degrees, many players have to contend with provocation from crowds, but it is not easy to handle it when it becomes personal and your wife and family are dragged into it. </p> <p>It happened to me at Aberdeen, when we emerged as the most successful team in the country under Alex Ferguson's management. Being the type of person I am, the temptation to deliberately wind up spectators who were having a go at me - especially the fans of Rangers and Celtic - was impossible to resist. I used to get a dog's abuse from the Old Firm followers.

      "body": "<p>Michael Owen will, after all, be wearing an England shirt on Wednesday. Unfortunately for him and Kevin Keegan it will not be against Argentina at Wembley, but in a charming new six-part children's television drama, Hero to Zero . </p> <p>Owen has been feeling a little like that title lately and this week's warm-up match for Euro 2000 increases his frustration. He is actually fit to play against the nation forever etched into his and our consciousness for that balmy, heady night in St Etienne when Owen's goal became the highlight of France 98, but after a year of hamstring injuries he has been working a six-week programme at Liverpool free of matches designed to prevent a recurrence. </p> <p>'Everyone asks me what's happening with the injury,' he says, 'but for the last four weeks it's not been an injury. I could have played against Leeds and Arsenal, but we actually decided that enough's enough and we should get it right.' He is pencilled in for a return in the potentially epic encounter against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 4 March. </p> <p>Owen has become an expert on hamstrings in the past 12 months, telling you that there are three outside muscles and one big one inside. Last year, the serious one was the inside on the right leg against Leeds. Then he came off this season against Southampton and West Ham with a problem in the left leg. The latest, against Middlesbrough, was an strained outside muscle on the right leg. Got all that? 'People talk about a recurring hamstring injury but I've not had the same one twice,' he says. </p> <p>He will either fly down to Wembley on Wednesday or watch from home depending on a currently demanding training schedule. Either way, it will be difficult to view the action without thinking back to two years ago, having made his debut this very month against Chile - becoming England's youngest cap - before reaching that height against Argentina. </p> <p>'I look back now and think that I'm going to do more than that, because I am so confident, and I do want to be remembered for more than that goal against Argentina', he says. 'But I must admit it's not a bad thing to be remembered for.' </p> <p>Talk us through it, Michael. 'The first thing I was thinking about when David Beckham chipped the ball up to me was getting away from the man right next to me and taking a touch into their half. Then, as soon as I wriggle away from him, you see me lift my head up. There's only one person to beat and it's a goal. </p> <p>'As a striker, when you get the ball, you are thinking mainly, \"Is there any way I can score from here?\" If not, then you keep possession or try to create something. As David passed me the ball, I didn't think, \"Here's a chance of a goal\". I was just trying to get the ball to where I could decide whether to dribble or pass. </p> <p>I say that once the first flush of youth has gone, I hope he doesn't settle for just laying the ball off in preference to being so direct. 'That is part of my game. If you said to me, \"Get hold of it and lay it off\" you wouldn't be playing to my strengths. My strength is scoring goals or running at defenders, making things happen. If you took any of that away from me, I probably wouldn't get into a Premier League team.' </p> <p>So what is he still working on? 'My left foot, my heading, even my right foot. You're always working on something, especially when you're 20. I've understood it when people have said, \"Oh he needs to work on this or that\". The thing I suppose I most want to improve is my left foot.' </p> <p>Talking to Owen, with his easy manner, it is easy to see why they wanted him for Hero to Zero . It is the story of a football-daft kid who idolises Owen. When things go wrong for the boy, he talks to a poster of Owen in his bedroom. One day, Owen steps out of the picture and dispenses advice and support. Worshipping boys and hormonal teenage girls will love it. </p> <p>Its writer, John Salthouse, originally produced it for radio with Gary Lineker in the part. Owen, who filmed his scenes in two days last summer, is a natural successor to 'goody two shoes'. 'Is that how people see me?' he asks. 'I just try to be what I am naturally.' </p> <p>With much talk lately of footballers as role models, does Owen find it a strain? 'Sometimes. You do have to be aware that as a footballer there are certain things you can't do, even things that aren't illegal, that normal people can do otherwise you're going to be in the papers getting photographed. </p> <p>'And while you'd prefer not to be troubled while you're having a meal with your family, I understand it. I mean, I had my heroes like Gary when I was a lad and if I'd seen them in the street I'd have wanted an autograph.' </p> <p>You tell him that Lineker once owned up to having sworn. Does he? 'When I miss a chance, yeah,' he says. In fact, you sense there is a more to come from Michael Owen - perhaps an edge that will be revealed one day - on and off the field. England will miss him on Wednesday. 'But I'd rather miss that one than the European Championships,' he says.</p>",

The thing I suppose I most want to improve is my left foot.' Talking to Owen, with his easy manner, it is easy to see why they wanted him for Hero to Zero . It is the story of a football-daft kid who idolises Owen. When things go wrong for the boy, he talks to a poster of Owen in his bedroom. One day, Owen steps out of the picture and dispenses advice and support. Worshipping boys and hormonal teenage girls will love it. Its writer, John Salthouse, originally produced it for radio with Gary Lineker in the part. Owen, who filmed his scenes in two days last summer, is a natural successor to 'goody two shoes'. 'Is that how people see me?' he asks. 'I just try to be what I am naturally.' With much talk lately of footballers as role models, does Owen find it a strain? 'Sometimes. You do have to be aware that as a footballer there are certain things you can't do, even things that aren't illegal, that normal people can do otherwise you're going to be in the papers getting photographed. 'And while you'd prefer not to be troubled while you're having a meal with your family, I understand it. I mean, I had my heroes like Gary when I was a lad and if I'd seen them in the street I'd have wanted an autograph.' You tell him that Lineker once owned up to having sworn. Does he? 'When I miss a chance, yeah,' he says. In fact, you sense there is a more to come from Michael Owen - perhaps an edge that will be revealed one day - on and off the field. England will miss him on Wednesday. 'But I'd rather miss that one than the European Championships,' he says.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I made my firsy trip to Britain when I was 13 years old. My parents, my grandmother, my eight-year-old brother and I went on a vacation that my mother probably filed under the heading, 'Expanding the Children's Horizons'. We visited the white cliffs of Dover, took walking tours of the City and ate steak and kidney pie in a pub in Wales. Britain was exactly what I had expected - old buildings and monarchy and steak and kidney pie in a pub. And, above all, it was white.</p> <p>Britain in my imagination had always been the Motherland of Whiteness. After all, it was English colonists who invented the concept as we understand it - that sense of superiority that justified keeping black people in bondage. The Britain I saw on TV and in movies - from Duran Duran videos to James Bond films to reruns of Benny Hill - only confirmed my impression. From my vantage point as an African-American, the word Britain was almost synonymous with whiteness.</p> <p>A fact which made me all the more curious about the idea of being black and British. I was aware that there were some black people in Britain, but I had never seen one in person. I wondered whether their experiences were similar to mine. I had no idea that when I finally did meet one, he would turn out to be the person that I would marry.</p> <p>We met at a dinner party in 1996. We were both working for the Washington Post and a colleague invited us over for dinner. As I walked in the door I saw him. He was sitting on the sofa wearing Doc Martens, jeans and a Spike Lee baseball jersey. His name was Gary. It took me only a few minutes to realise that this young black man with a flat-top and an earring was good-looking, very funny and, intriguingly, British. When I heard his accent my latent curiosity about black British people was rekindled.</p> <p>I made up my mind that I was not going to let him leave without asking him a few questions about race, so I spent much of the rest of the dinner party waiting for my chance. We were well past the main course and into coffee when I finally saw my opportunity.</p> <p>I turned to him. 'After living here for two months, what have you found are the differences between race in America and race in Britain?'</p> <p>He smiled. 'For a start, in England you probably wouldn't have asked the question.'</p> <p>A year and a half later we were discussing marriage, and I was trying to decide how I felt about the idea of living in England. Although I had lived in several different cities in the US, I had never spent more than three weeks in another country. Aside from missing my friends and family, and the small matter of giving up my job, my main reservation was about what it might be like to be a black person there.</p> <p>To understand why I was concerned you have to know that many years ago I undertook a personal mission to be a black person. You might be tempted to point out at this stage that, technically, I am a black person. Both of my parents are black, as are their parents. On the surface it seems like I have all the credentials I need. But I was raised in a predominantly white neighbourhood and attended predominantly white schools and churches. And despite my parents' best efforts to build a network of black friends with children my age, I always felt on the periphery of the black community.</p> <p>I had a sense that I was missing something. A vital part of American cultural and political life was taking place in the black community, and here I was with a free entry ticket still sitting unused in my pocket. I felt that my identity as a black person would not be whole until I had become more integrated into black America.</p> <p>Various attempts to be more involved in black groups in college had failed, and in graduate school and at the Post I was so buried in work I had few friends, black or otherwise. But I hadn't given up on my battle for blackness. And suddenly I was facing the possibility of moving to England, which felt like a full-scale retreat. What did England have to offer me as a black person?</p> <p>I felt sure that my quest would end, my identity as a black person would stagnate. But I faced a choice between giving up my quest and giving up Gary. So I chucked in my job, sold my furniture, zipped around the country visiting a few college friends and bought a ticket to the Motherland of Whiteness.</p> <p>I hadn't been there two months when the issue of race was splattered over the headlines of every newspaper in England. The Stephen Lawrence inquiry was entering the final stages of its investigation. Gary, who likes to say that in Britain race is like sex, politics and religion - a topic best not discussed at dinner parties - assured me that it was unusual for it to take up that much space in British public dialogue.</p> <p>In America we talk about race obsessively. America has been talking about it for more than 300 years, and we've become polished practitioners of the art of racial dialogue. Whatever people may actually believe, they generally know what kinds of statements they can get away with in public. Anybody who makes overtly racist comments is usually either a white supremacist nut with a pointy hat or someone whose private conversations were accidentally or surreptitiously made public.</p> <p>Which is fine by me. People say they would rather that bigots were upfront about their attitudes and didn't hide behind a mask of publicly acceptable language. Frankly, I generally feel that if you're racist I don't really want to hear about it. Just keep it to yourself. I have better things to do than listen to you unload your bigotries and prejudices on me.

The six of us looked at each other awkwardly. Five months after moving to Britain I had finally organised something I had been talking about since I arrived: a book group for women of colour. You'll have to excuse the Americanism of that phrase. In Britain you might call it a black book group. But in the US, the word black is held exclusively by people of African descent. When I first learnt that in England it often also covers people of Asian descent, my initial reaction was an odd sense of territoriality. That's our word, I thought. We worked hard for that word. For generations it was considered an insult until in the Sixties and Seventies we decided to grab it and hold it to show we weren't intimidated by the colour of our own skin. Let Asians get their own word.</p> <p>But on further reflection, it occurred to me that this is probably a good thing. There is a lot of hostility between ethnic minorities in America, a hostility that worries me quite a bit. We have less in common than British minorities. African-Americans, unlike Latinos and Asian-Americans, are not recent immigrants. And we did not come to the US voluntarily. At the moment African-Americans set the terms of the racial agenda in America. But the Asian and Latino populations are growing at a faster rate, and in a few more years Latinos will outnumber us. If we can't figure out how to work with them, we may soon find ourselves on the margins of the racial debate.</p> <p>Although people of Asian, Caribbean and African descent don't always get along in Britain, they seem to share a sense of a common lot. They came to Britain at the same time for roughly the same reasons. In America if I had joined a book group it probably would have been an African-American one. But here it made sense to broaden the scope.</p> <p>Although I understand the value of calling ourselves a black women's book group, I still can't quite bring myself to feel that Indians and Pakistanis are black. And I'm not sure whether it applies to people from other parts of the Asian continent - Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Cambodian. I'm not convinced British people know the answer to this either. So for the moment I'm sticking to women of colour.</p> <p>We represented a real variety pack of ethnicities. There was one woman who is mixed Japanese and white, one who is mixed South African Indian and white, one who is Eritrean by birth but adopted by a white English family, one whose parents are Asian Indians from South America, one Japanese woman, and me. I was feeling pretty racially bland by comparison. And I was beginning to wonder if Britain could offer me opportunities for racial understanding that I wouldn't have had in America. Or at least I was until this moment of silence. I had just raised the issue of race.</p> <p>'Although I brought this group together,' I explained, 'I don't want to become its dictator. I organised it as a book group for women of colour, but it doesn't have to be that way. We could invite white women. Or we could have men as well. I'm ready to do whatever the majority wants. What do you think?'</p> <p>And then there was that silence. I was trying to imagine what is going on in everyone's head but I couldn't. And I started to wonder if this was such a good idea after all.</p> <p>I made the mistake of getting out at Westbourne Park Tube station, so I had a bit of a walk to find the famed Notting Hill Carnival. I wasn't exactly sure how to get there. I decided to follow the white guys wearing the Jamaican hats with the dreadlocks attached. I walked past the caf\u00e9 selling panini and ciabatta, past the halal butchers and the Arabic video store, past the pubs where hip-hop music spills on to the streets. The long tendrils of carnival stretched deep into the neighbourhood. People with beer cans danced on terraces.</p> <p>As we got closer to its heart, the crowd became more and more dense until it was almost impossible to move. The parade ground slowly past the spectators, a long chain of giant speakers, electric-coloured costumes and wiggling hips. Many of the floats generated a little wake of dancers who appeared to have spontaneously joined the procession. I struck up a chat with a fellow African-American who had a video camera clamped to his eye. His name was Joe, and it turned out he is something of a carnival fanatic. He likes to make a vacation of following the US carnival circuit from New York to DC to Miami to Atlanta. This was the first year he tried the London one and he was very impressed.</p> <p>'Most of the carnivals [in the US] are restricted to the black areas so you just don't have this mixture,' he said.</p> <p>I'd been noticing the same thing. Carnival seems to have evolved into something of a racial oasis for Londoners, a place to comfortably enjoy diversity, an escape from the racial tensions of everyday life. The crowd was an even mix between black and white with a hearty sprinkling of Asians. Although most of the people on the floats were black, many of the dancers that followed them were white.</p> <p>'If you look around you see people of different colours, different races. It's nice in a society troubled with racism. It's nice to see different races coming here,' said Sue, 33, who is an Asian Indian from Guyana.</p> <p>'I think out of all the places in the world, London is the most tolerant. You just have to look at all the mixed children walking around,' said Tina who had a stud in her nose and a five-year-old girl in her arms. Tina is white but the father of her two daughters is black. 'I don't think we're so much into segregation.'</p> <p>There's a way in which this is a refreshing break from America's more rigid separation. But segregation has its perks. We have blues, jazz, gospel, rock'n'roll and hip hop today because black Americans had their own creative space. We have the unique cadences of black churches and black colleges and universities that still churn out the majority of black doctors, judges and PhDs. They are the byproduct of a racist system that barred blacks from mixing with whites. But just because blacks can attend white churches and colleges now, doesn't mean we should be in any rush to dismantle the black ones. Without some space to maintain distinct cultural identities, white American culture could quickly take over, reaching into every nook and cranny of American life, stamping out all the cultural variety.</p> <p>That London embraces Notting Hill Carnival, after years of trying to crush it, is a good thing. But it is not without cost. Some of carnival's Caribbean lustre is dulling. Maybe it's gaining something through its encounter with London's mix of ethnicities. Evolution and change are necessary to keep a culture healthy and vibrant. But when you have a minority culture within a larger one, evolution can quickly turn into homogenisation. In its eagerness for integration, white England could inadvertently snuffle out the cultural distinctiveness that it found so attractive in the first place.</p> <p>One afternoon I dragged my brother out of bed and made him come to Brixton with me. Mike Tyson was supposed to be walking through the neighbourhood and I thought Kevin, who was visiting me for two weeks, might find it interesting. By the time we arrived, the street near the mosque where Tyson was worshipping was already filled with Tyson fans. We waited for a few minutes, trying to work out the best vantage point, when the crowd suddenly surged forward. Tyson, rumour had it, had come out of the mosque. We dashed ahead, hoping to get a glimpse. But the clutch of police, bodyguards, photographers and fans was so thick around him I couldn't see anything.</p> <p>'Where's Mike, man? Damn,' said one man. 'Tyson, big up!' yelled another. 'I want to see Tyson,' shouted a woman waving her hands. 'We love you! We love you!' Fans pumped their fists in the air and whooped. They clapped, cheered, snapped pictures, chanted 'Tyson! Tyson! Tyson!' The hood of a blue Volvo buckled as young men climbed on it to get a better view.</p> <p>We jerked and lurched along Gresham Road, blocking traffic. A number 35 bus to Shoreditch slowed to a halt and passengers on both decks banged on the windows as Tyson passed. Although it was reported that he was going to walk through the neighbour hood, he only made it about a block and a half before he ducked into a police station. As everyone settled down I tried to figure out which I found more grotesque, this crowd's passion for Tyson or the media's passion against him.</p> <p>I wasn't particularly interested in Tyson's visit to Britain until I saw a picture of him on the front page of the Independent that showed him behind the gates of the Grosvenor Hotel. The picture was shot so that the gate resembles prison bars. The image grabbed my attention as my racial antennae started quivering. I began to notice the way the media portrayed him. The Evening Standard ran a headline saying, 'Man you last want to meet in the park at 3am.' The Independent topped one story with, 'The Crocodile, the rapist and a snarling entourage. The Tyson circus comes to town.' The Sun wrote, 'I watched tots flee in panic.' He was called a monster, an animal, a brute.</p> <p>Over the space of a few days the papers managed to invoke just about every racist stereotype there is about black men, as though the fact that he's a rapist made it OK to brand him with racist imagery. American newspapers would have a tough time getting away with some of this stuff, highlighting the difference between a country that has set the boundaries for public debate and a country that, despite Stephen Lawrence, is still working on it.</p> <p>To be fair, Tyson gave them plenty of ammunition, including the moronic and offensive comments he made about women. But it's as though editors and reporters finally saw their chance to unleash everything they've ever wanted to say about black men. They gleefully lunged at what appeared to be a safe outlet for all their bigotry and prejudice and fear. As Darcus Howe put it, they turned him into 'the big black scary man you have to protect your daughters from'.</p> <p>And then they sat back and wondered why the crowd in Brixton embraced him. The more white folks abused him, the more they turned him into the victim, the more they helped elevate his status as hero in the black community.</p> <p>'There's no living figure that equally faced the trials and tribulations that young black men face - the trials and tribulations with women, the trials and tribulations with the criminal justice system, the trials and tribulations with broken families,' a young bespectacled black man named Marcus said as we waited for Tyson to come out of the police station. 'He's easily the most symbolic figure of our generation.'</p> <p>But the problem is, in the rush to hero-worship, the horror of the crime he committed was lost. 'I don't think it was a rape really. Why would he have to rape someone?' said Richard, 42. 'If a girl came to my bedroom, she'd get the same treatment.'</p> <p>It's a classic dilemma for black feminists - you see white people camped out on one side of an issue and black people camped out on another and although you may agree with the white people in principle, you don't want to pitch your tent with them because they've turned a reasonable argument into a revolting prejudice. There's no middle ground, no safe space in which you can condemn both rape and racism.</p> <p>I knew I was in the right place when I saw a crowd of well-dressed black folk clumped on the narrow street corner near Piccadilly Circus. White folks in business suits gave the group a wide berth. We were all waiting to be let into the club where Spike Lee was giving a talk. The snatches of conversation I caught told me it was a gathering of media types. When I finally got inside, most of the sofas that were crammed into this dimly lit, low-ceilinged room were already filled. I was forced to take one in the back corner. Waiters swooped through with trays of Jamaica mule and fried sweetcorn.</p> <p>Lee settled into a stuffed chair in the centre of the room, and a journalist quizzed him about his latest movie, Summer of Sam . Then the floor was opened to questions, most of which were about his work until a woman with her hair in a white ponytail holder changed the subject. Black actors in Britain, she told him, have a hard time getting work. Not, mind you, that she is an actor herself, but she has friends who are. Is there anything Spike can do for them?</p> <p>'I've been coming here since 1986 and every time I come I get asked this same question. Spike, what can you do for us?' said Lee. 'Nothing's changed.'</p> <p>And then we were off into a boisterous debate about black Britain.</p> <p>'How many years have black people been here? Fifty?' asked Lee.</p> <p>'Six hundred,' someone shouted.</p> <p>'Six hundred? Come on. How many years? Fifty?'</p> <p>There was more tussling over the number until Lee finally settled on his original figure.</p> <p>'Your experience isn't like ours. You all weren't slaves,' he said.</p> <p>The audience grumbled.</p> <p>'You weren't slaves in the UK. Don't start splitting hairs now.'</p> <p>By this point I was starting to feel a little embarrassed by his attitude. Mostly because it reminded me of me.</p> <p>Before I met Gary I was curious about black British people, but in a dismissive and flip kind of way. I think I remember saying something to Gary to the effect that if black British people wanted to have a conference all three of them could get together in someone's living room, or something like that.</p> <p>It always amazes me how much black people in Britain seem to know about and identify with black Americans. Sometimes I want to say, you do realise that black Americans are barely aware that you exist.</p> <p>We African-Americans are a very insular bunch. Unlike black British people who are generally only one or two generations away from another country and culture, we have spent more than 200 years in America and our battles are firmly rooted there.</p> <p>We don't know about, nor are we particularly interested in, anybody else's problems. We've lost a sense of our struggle being related to struggles around the world. And we forget that despite the entrenched poverty that still afflicts many black Americans, as a group we are probably among the richest black people in the world.</p> <p>I am reminded of a conversation I had with a young black American woman named Aline who was studying in Paris. It was the first time she had lived in another country too. 'In their minds they're the ones in pain, they're the ones who have had a hard time,' she said of black Americans. 'The day that a black American leaves the States they'll see that other people have had it bad too.'</p> <p>That damned silence was back again. It had been nearly a year since our first book group meeting. In that year we read Jackie Kay and Arundhati Roy and Laura Esquivel. We talked about visiting our relatives in other countries and going to predominantly white schools. The Japanese woman, who has a biracial daughter, grilled the woman who is mixed Japanese and white about what her childhood was like.</p> <p>Then one woman said she has a white friend who was interested in joining. And we suddenly found ourselves having to face the same question that I posed so many months ago. Hence the silence. Even after a year I was still not sure what people thought about this issue. But slowly, one by one, tentative arguments bubbled to the surface. Having white people would change the kinds of discussions we have, said one. This is one of the few opportunities I've had to be part of an all-black group, said another. Eventually we decided to keep things as they are. I was glad this woman brought up the possibility of inviting white people because it forced everyone to articulate a position. But I am also relieved that we turned down the suggestion.</p> <p>The book club has helped me warm to my new home. I imagine that our little group represents the best of both worlds - black America's rigorous defence of its distinct identity and black Britain's more inclusive attitude toward a broader spectrum of ethnic minorities. And I decided that my quest hasn't really ended, it has simply taken an unexpected but profitable detour.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I made my firsy trip to Britain when I was 13 years old. My parents, my grandmother, my eight-year-old brother and I went on a vacation that my mother probably filed under the heading, 'Expanding the Children's Horizons'. We visited the white cliffs of Dover, took walking tours of the City and ate steak and kidney pie in a pub in Wales. Britain was exactly what I had expected - old buildings and monarchy and steak and kidney pie in a pub. And, above all, it was white. Britain in my imagination had always been the Motherland of Whiteness. After all, it was English colonists who invented the concept as we understand it - that sense of superiority that justified keeping black people in bondage. The Britain I saw on TV and in movies - from Duran Duran videos to James Bond films to reruns of Benny Hill - only confirmed my impression. From my vantage point as an African-American, the word Britain was almost synonymous with whiteness. A fact which made me all the more curious about the idea of being black and British. I was aware that there were some black people in Britain, but I had never seen one in person. I wondered whether their experiences were similar to mine. I had no idea that when I finally did meet one, he would turn out to be the person that I would marry. We met at a dinner party in 1996. We were both working for the Washington Post and a colleague invited us over for dinner. As I walked in the door I saw him. He was sitting on the sofa wearing Doc Martens, jeans and a Spike Lee baseball jersey. His name was Gary. It took me only a few minutes to realise that this young black man with a flat-top and an earring was good-looking, very funny and, intriguingly, British. When I heard his accent my latent curiosity about black British people was rekindled. I made up my mind that I was not going to let him leave without asking him a few questions about race, so I spent much of the rest of the dinner party waiting for my chance. We were well past the main course and into coffee when I finally saw my opportunity. I turned to him. 'After living here for two months, what have you found are the differences between race in America and race in Britain?' He smiled. 'For a start, in England you probably wouldn't have asked the question.' A year and a half later we were discussing marriage, and I was trying to decide how I felt about the idea of living in England. Although I had lived in several different cities in the US, I had never spent more than three weeks in another country. Aside from missing my friends and family, and the small matter of giving up my job, my main reservation was about what it might be like to be a black person there. To understand why I was concerned you have to know that many years ago I undertook a personal mission to be a black person. You might be tempted to point out at this stage that, technically, I am a black person. Both of my parents are black, as are their parents. On the surface it seems like I have all the credentials I need. But I was raised in a predominantly white neighbourhood and attended predominantly white schools and churches. And despite my parents' best efforts to build a network of black friends with children my age, I always felt on the periphery of the black community. I had a sense that I was missing something. A vital part of American cultural and political life was taking place in the black community, and here I was with a free entry ticket still sitting unused in my pocket. I felt that my identity as a black person would not be whole until I had become more integrated into black America. Various attempts to be more involved in black groups in college had failed, and in graduate school and at the Post I was so buried in work I had few friends, black or otherwise. But I hadn't given up on my battle for blackness. And suddenly I was facing the possibility of moving to England, which felt like a full-scale retreat. What did England have to offer me as a black person? I felt sure that my quest would end, my identity as a black person would stagnate. But I faced a choice between giving up my quest and giving up Gary. So I chucked in my job, sold my furniture, zipped around the country visiting a few college friends and bought a ticket to the Motherland of Whiteness. I hadn't been there two months when the issue of race was splattered over the headlines of every newspaper in England. The Stephen Lawrence inquiry was entering the final stages of its investigation. Gary, who likes to say that in Britain race is like sex, politics and religion - a topic best not discussed at dinner parties - assured me that it was unusual for it to take up that much space in British public dialogue. In America we talk about race obsessively. America has been talking about it for more than 300 years, and we've become polished practitioners of the art of racial dialogue. Whatever people may actually believe, they generally know what kinds of statements they can get away with in public. Anybody who makes overtly racist comments is usually either a white supremacist nut with a pointy hat or someone whose private conversations were accidentally or surreptitiously made public. Which is fine by me. People say they would rather that bigots were upfront about their attitudes and didn't hide behind a mask of publicly acceptable language. Frankly, I generally feel that if you're racist I don't really want to hear about it. Just keep it to yourself. I have better things to do than listen to you unload your bigotries and prejudices on me. Moving to a country where police don't understand why the word 'coloured' is offensive felt like a step back in time. Not that American police are a model of racial enlightenment. It struck me that British racism was not more brutal, but certainly more crude. And less acknowledged. One of the things that intrigued me about the Lawrence inquiry was the debate over the phrase 'institutional racism'. Everyone seemed in a rush to call the racism displayed by police 'unintentional' or 'subliminal' or 'unconscious'. The British were unwilling to admit that the phrase means exactly what it appears to - racism ingrained in an intuition.

'The UK has absolutely no sense at all for the reality of racism,' Trevor Phillips told me. 'It has no sense for the way that its schools, its police produce a biased outcome. Most people in this country think the issue of race is entirely about whether individual people like each other. If the inquiry does its job, it will explode that myth.' What was shocking for many Americans about the Rodney King and Abner Louima cases was the level of ferocity and fearlessness displayed by the police, not the possibility of bigotry. America knows it's racist. Some of the difference may be related to the fact Britain still has many institutions that are untouched by a black presence. There are few places in American life that blacks have never been. Blacks have penetrated just about every level of business, government and academia, even if only in small numbers.

One afternoon I dragged my brother out of bed and made him come to Brixton with me. Mike Tyson was supposed to be walking through the neighbourhood and I thought Kevin, who was visiting me for two weeks, might find it interesting. By the time we arrived, the street near the mosque where Tyson was worshipping was already filled with Tyson fans. We waited for a few minutes, trying to work out the best vantage point, when the crowd suddenly surged forward. Tyson, rumour had it, had come out of the mosque. We dashed ahead, hoping to get a glimpse. But the clutch of police, bodyguards, photographers and fans was so thick around him I couldn't see anything. 'Where's Mike, man? Damn,' said one man. 'Tyson, big up!' yelled another. 'I want to see Tyson,' shouted a woman waving her hands. 'We love you! We love you!' Fans pumped their fists in the air and whooped. They clapped, cheered, snapped pictures, chanted 'Tyson! Tyson! Tyson!' The hood of a blue Volvo buckled as young men climbed on it to get a better view. We jerked and lurched along Gresham Road, blocking traffic. A number 35 bus to Shoreditch slowed to a halt and passengers on both decks banged on the windows as Tyson passed. Although it was reported that he was going to walk through the neighbour hood, he only made it about a block and a half before he ducked into a police station. As everyone settled down I tried to figure out which I found more grotesque, this crowd's passion for Tyson or the media's passion against him. I wasn't particularly interested in Tyson's visit to Britain until I saw a picture of him on the front page of the Independent that showed him behind the gates of the Grosvenor Hotel. The picture was shot so that the gate resembles prison bars. The image grabbed my attention as my racial antennae started quivering. I began to notice the way the media portrayed him. The Evening Standard ran a headline saying, 'Man you last want to meet in the park at 3am.' The Independent topped one story with, 'The Crocodile, the rapist and a snarling entourage. The Tyson circus comes to town.' The Sun wrote, 'I watched tots flee in panic.' He was called a monster, an animal, a brute. Over the space of a few days the papers managed to invoke just about every racist stereotype there is about black men, as though the fact that he's a rapist made it OK to brand him with racist imagery. American newspapers would have a tough time getting away with some of this stuff, highlighting the difference between a country that has set the boundaries for public debate and a country that, despite Stephen Lawrence, is still working on it. To be fair, Tyson gave them plenty of ammunition, including the moronic and offensive comments he made about women. But it's as though editors and reporters finally saw their chance to unleash everything they've ever wanted to say about black men. They gleefully lunged at what appeared to be a safe outlet for all their bigotry and prejudice and fear. As Darcus Howe put it, they turned him into 'the big black scary man you have to protect your daughters from'. And then they sat back and wondered why the crowd in Brixton embraced him. The more white folks abused him, the more they turned him into the victim, the more they helped elevate his status as hero in the black community. 'There's no living figure that equally faced the trials and tribulations that young black men face - the trials and tribulations with women, the trials and tribulations with the criminal justice system, the trials and tribulations with broken families,' a young bespectacled black man named Marcus said as we waited for Tyson to come out of the police station. 'He's easily the most symbolic figure of our generation.' But the problem is, in the rush to hero-worship, the horror of the crime he committed was lost. 'I don't think it was a rape really. Why would he have to rape someone?' said Richard, 42. 'If a girl came to my bedroom, she'd get the same treatment.' It's a classic dilemma for black feminists - you see white people camped out on one side of an issue and black people camped out on another and although you may agree with the white people in principle, you don't want to pitch your tent with them because they've turned a reasonable argument into a revolting prejudice. There's no middle ground, no safe space in which you can condemn both rape and racism. I knew I was in the right place when I saw a crowd of well-dressed black folk clumped on the narrow street corner near Piccadilly Circus. White folks in business suits gave the group a wide berth. We were all waiting to be let into the club where Spike Lee was giving a talk. The snatches of conversation I caught told me it was a gathering of media types. When I finally got inside, most of the sofas that were crammed into this dimly lit, low-ceilinged room were already filled. I was forced to take one in the back corner. Waiters swooped through with trays of Jamaica mule and fried sweetcorn. Lee settled into a stuffed chair in the centre of the room, and a journalist quizzed him about his latest movie, Summer of Sam . Then the floor was opened to questions, most of which were about his work until a woman with her hair in a white ponytail holder changed the subject. Black actors in Britain, she told him, have a hard time getting work. Not, mind you, that she is an actor herself, but she has friends who are. Is there anything Spike can do for them? 'I've been coming here since 1986 and every time I come I get asked this same question. Spike, what can you do for us?' said Lee. 'Nothing's changed.' And then we were off into a boisterous debate about black Britain. 'How many years have black people been here? Fifty?' asked Lee. 'Six hundred,' someone shouted. 'Six hundred? Come on. How many years? Fifty?' There was more tussling over the number until Lee finally settled on his original figure. 'Your experience isn't like ours. You all weren't slaves,' he said. The audience grumbled. 'You weren't slaves in the UK. Don't start splitting hairs now.' By this point I was starting to feel a little embarrassed by his attitude. Mostly because it reminded me of me. Before I met Gary I was curious about black British people, but in a dismissive and flip kind of way. I think I remember saying something to Gary to the effect that if black British people wanted to have a conference all three of them could get together in someone's living room, or something like that. It always amazes me how much black people in Britain seem to know about and identify with black Americans. Sometimes I want to say, you do realise that black Americans are barely aware that you exist. We African-Americans are a very insular bunch. Unlike black British people who are generally only one or two generations away from another country and culture, we have spent more than 200 years in America and our battles are firmly rooted there. We don't know about, nor are we particularly interested in, anybody else's problems. We've lost a sense of our struggle being related to struggles around the world. And we forget that despite the entrenched poverty that still afflicts many black Americans, as a group we are probably among the richest black people in the world. I am reminded of a conversation I had with a young black American woman named Aline who was studying in Paris. It was the first time she had lived in another country too. 'In their minds they're the ones in pain, they're the ones who have had a hard time,' she said of black Americans. 'The day that a black American leaves the States they'll see that other people have had it bad too.' That damned silence was back again. It had been nearly a year since our first book group meeting. In that year we read Jackie Kay and Arundhati Roy and Laura Esquivel. We talked about visiting our relatives in other countries and going to predominantly white schools. The Japanese woman, who has a biracial daughter, grilled the woman who is mixed Japanese and white about what her childhood was like. Then one woman said she has a white friend who was interested in joining. And we suddenly found ourselves having to face the same question that I posed so many months ago. Hence the silence. Even after a year I was still not sure what people thought about this issue. But slowly, one by one, tentative arguments bubbled to the surface. Having white people would change the kinds of discussions we have, said one. This is one of the few opportunities I've had to be part of an all-black group, said another. Eventually we decided to keep things as they are. I was glad this woman brought up the possibility of inviting white people because it forced everyone to articulate a position. But I am also relieved that we turned down the suggestion. The book club has helped me warm to my new home. I imagine that our little group represents the best of both worlds - black America's rigorous defence of its distinct identity and black Britain's more inclusive attitude toward a broader spectrum of ethnic minorities. And I decided that my quest hasn't really ended, it has simply taken an unexpected but profitable detour.",

The errors resulted in the inaccurate recording of radioactive discharges at Hinkley Point, the nuclear power station on the Bristol Channel. </p> <p>The revelation follows the publication of three highly critical Government reports that highlight failures of control at the company's Sellafield complex in Cumbria. </p> <p>The new report - by an inspector from the Environment Agency - suggests BNFL is beset by management problems. The inspector told The Observer his investigations found an 'extremely serious' situation, which 'cuts at the very foundation of the method of regulation'. </p> <p>He said these indicated failures were not limited to Sellafield, an observation that will raise worrying concerns about the culture of management throughout the company, which owns eight operational first-generation Magnox power stations, along with the Sellafield site and other operations. </p> <p>The problems at Hinkley Point concern carbon-14 emissions between December 1997 and December 1999. Only half the real emissions of the isotope were recorded by staff, it now appears. </p> <p>The Environment Agency inspector, Jim Pagington, said a BNFL employee had noted high levels of emissions and assumed his figures were distorted by the presence of another radioactive substance, sulphur-35. </p> <p>He then calculated how much sulphur-35 he thought was present, and subtracted it from the total. This was significant enough to alter the annual total, and reduce it by 50 per cent. </p> <p>'A member of staff thought that because the carbon-14 discharges were high, the sampling system was not working,' Pagington told The Observer . 'He thought the sulphur-35 was being carried over with carbon-14, so he subtracted one figure from another. He was wrong.' </p> <p>Pagington stressed, however, that the emissions did not breach the agency's limit for C14 emissions. 'The most serious thing about this is that it is a breach of company procedure,' he said. </p> <p>'It shows the management processes are failing and seems to indicate it is not just a problem in one place. We take it extremely seriously. It cuts at the very foundation of regulation.' </p> <p>He had not yet decided if the misrecording amounted to deliberate falsification, but did not rule that out as a possibility. </p> <p>Last week the Environment Agency issued an enforcement notice on a BNFL subsidiary, Magnox Electric, which operates Hinkley A, requiring the company to re-examine the samples concerned and revise its monitoring procedures. Hinkley Point A's two reactors are currently shut down following separate safety concerns. </p> <p>Patrick van den Bulck of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament said: 'With these revelations following hard on the heels of the Sellafield data falsification scandal, it would seem that fabricating records is endemic within BNFL.' </p> <p>Several damning reports about BNFL were issued by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate last week. Three major problems at the company were highlighted: lack of high-quality safety management, lack of resources to carry out existing safety management and lack of independent inspection.</p>",

The new report - by an inspector from the Environment Agency - suggests BNFL is beset by management problems. The inspector told The Observer his investigations found an 'extremely serious' situation, which 'cuts at the very foundation of the method of regulation'. He said these indicated failures were not limited to Sellafield, an observation that will raise worrying concerns about the culture of management throughout the company, which owns eight operational first-generation Magnox power stations, along with the Sellafield site and other operations. The problems at Hinkley Point concern carbon-14 emissions between December 1997 and December 1999. Only half the real emissions of the isotope were recorded by staff, it now appears. The Environment Agency inspector, Jim Pagington, said a BNFL employee had noted high levels of emissions and assumed his figures were distorted by the presence of another radioactive substance, sulphur-35. He then calculated how much sulphur-35 he thought was present, and subtracted it from the total. This was significant enough to alter the annual total, and reduce it by 50 per cent. 'A member of staff thought that because the carbon-14 discharges were high, the sampling system was not working,' Pagington told The Observer . 'He thought the sulphur-35 was being carried over with carbon-14, so he subtracted one figure from another. He was wrong.' Pagington stressed, however, that the emissions did not breach the agency's limit for C14 emissions. 'The most serious thing about this is that it is a breach of company procedure,' he said. 'It shows the management processes are failing and seems to indicate it is not just a problem in one place. We take it extremely seriously. It cuts at the very foundation of regulation.' He had not yet decided if the misrecording amounted to deliberate falsification, but did not rule that out as a possibility. Last week the Environment Agency issued an enforcement notice on a BNFL subsidiary, Magnox Electric, which operates Hinkley A, requiring the company to re-examine the samples concerned and revise its monitoring procedures. Hinkley Point A's two reactors are currently shut down following separate safety concerns. Patrick van den Bulck of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament said: 'With these revelations following hard on the heels of the Sellafield data falsification scandal, it would seem that fabricating records is endemic within BNFL.' Several damning reports about BNFL were issued by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate last week. Three major problems at the company were highlighted: lack of high-quality safety management, lack of resources to carry out existing safety management and lack of independent inspection.",

The overwhelming majority of Labour party members and trade unionists have voted for me, whereas Frank secured the support of just over one third of Labour party members. At a rough estimate, a total of 80,000 people have voted for me in all sections of the electoral college, compared to 25,000 for Frank. This huge democratic mandate is a ringing endorsement of the policies I have put to the London Labour party. The support I have received from party members, trade unionists and ordinary Londoners has been overwhelming. I am grateful to them for their encouragement throughout this campaign. This result has been delivered by one trade union boss, one retired MEP and one small Co-op branch, which did not ballot its members. It is based on the fact that 8% of the electoral college was voted by Sir Ken Jackson and the South London Co-op, who refused to allow their members to cast their own votes and cast them instead for Frank Dobson. I urge everybody to stay inside the Labour party and fight to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again. There must now be a serious question over whether Frank can hope to beat Steven Norris on May 4 when Londoners will widely perceive the Labour nomination to have been stolen. The lesson of Wales is that our voters will not be taken for granted. A Labour campaign that was dead in the water from day one, will limp on to polling day and never allow us to get on to the real issues that matter to Londoners, such as transport, unemployment and crime. In the interests of uniting the Labour party, I hope Frank Dobson will consider his position over the next few days. He must decide whether he is willing to accept this tainted result or stand down in the interests of Labour and London. Over the last six months Londoners have had to listen to politicians.

Mr Dobson polled 51.53% of the total vote in the bitter battle to become the party's candidate, while the former GLC leader received 48.47% after a second ballot. Third candidate Glenda Jackson was eliminated after the first ballot and her votes were redistributed between the two main contenders. Speaking after the result was announced, an emotional Mr Livingstone said he hoped that Mr Dobson \"would consider his position over the next few days after this \"tainted result\". But at Labour's official press conference from its Millbank headquarters, Mr Dobson denied responsibility for Labour's electoral system and rejected Mr Livingstone's call for him to stand down. Mr Dobson argued that Mr Livingstone had given his word to the party that he would accept the result delivered by Labour's complex electoral college. The MP for Holborn and St Pancras was also anxious to disassociate himself from the system which elected him, saying he had wanted a one member, one vote system and claiming he would have also won had this process been used. \"The system that was used was not introduced because I asked for it,\" Mr Dobson told the press conference. \"I was against it.\" Mr Livingstone, who polled a convincing 54.9% majority among Labour members against just 35.3% for Mr Dobson, claimed 8% of the poll had been \"stolen\" from him through an undemocratic electoral college. \"This result has been delivered by one trade union boss, one retired MEP and one small Co-op branch, which did not ballot its members,\" he told reporters outside his London home. Mr Livingstone also urged \"everybody to stay in the Labour party\", while fuelling speculation that he could still run as an independent candidate against Mr Dobson by saying he would say no more on the subject \"until I have had a chance to listen to Londoners.\" Mr Livingstone has already been warned by some of his strongest supporters that he should not run as an independent against Mr Dobson, a move which would see his expulsion from the Labour party. The public sector union Unison, which voted for Mr Livingstone by more than two to one said it would now fully support Mr Dobson's campaign. \"Our message is: Don't go it alone Ken. Get behind Frank to be the first mayor of London in May,\" regional secretary Chris Humphreys said. Mark Seddon, editor of Tribune and a member of Labour's national executive committee, said that defeat in today's ballot would not necessarily mean the end of Mr Livingstone's ambition to be Labour mayor of London. \"There are going to be all sorts of powerful pressures put on Ken Livingstone to run as an independent, and for people like me... who have always argued against breakaways and the SDP, we're not going to support that,\" he said. Mr Dobson immediately faced accusations of being Tony Blair's \"poodle\" from his rival Conservative and Liberal Democrat mayoral candidates. Tory candidate Steven Norris called Mr Dobson's election \"a thoroughly shameful process\" which has left him \"to dodge the charge that not only is he the prime minister's poodle, he is also the candidate his own party didn't want.\" Susan Kramer, the Liberal Democrat candidate for mayor, said the system had been rigged in favour of Mr Dobson, whom she branded the Government's \"lapdog\". \"Frank Dobson has only won Labour's selection because the system was rigged in his favour. \"He does not have the support of a majority of Labour members. He cannot hope to win the support of a majority of Londoners. \"Frank Dobson's campaign has shown that he has no bite and precious little bark.

Over three hours we see a large cast in action and listen to their thoughts on warfare. They range from an idealistic GI (James Caviezel) to a regular colonel (Nick Nolte) concerned only for his career.

Gregory (John Gordon Sinclair) now teaches at his old comprehensive but is as dreamy and disorganised as ever. The latest object of his lustful fantasies is another 16-year-old girl soccer star (fetching newcomer Carly McKinnon), who draws him into a scheme to expose a local factory's illicit dealings with Third World dictators.

Kevin Kline (cautious inventor Artemus Gordon) and Will Smith (impetuous adventurer James West) play the secret service agents sent by President Grant to pursue post-Civil War villains, and Kenneth Branagh is the insane, ex-Confederate villain with ambitions to destroy the United States. An enormous amount of money has gone into the hardware and special effects, but little has been spent on providing good lines for the delectable Salma Hayek. </p> <p> <strong> Mickey Blue Eyes</strong><br> (1999, 15, VHS/Rental) </p> <p> The sub-genre of comedies about innocents straying into the world of organised crime began in the 1930s (eg, Will Hay's Hey!

      "body": "<p>Every wised-up wit who mistakes knowingness for knowledge proclaims that Peter Mandelson is a gutless fixer; a master manipulator who will twist and dodge around the clock to keep the privileges of power and pelf. If a focus group tells him to drop a principle, it shatters on the ground in seconds. If an opinion poll tells him the public wants to hear that two plus two equals five, the Parliamentary Labour Party appears on the rolling news shows to denounce maths teachers as dinosaurs who must modernise or die.</p> <p>If only the idle stereotype were true. Ireland could do with the mythical Mandelson: a politician without ideological 'baggage', who can fudge and platitudinise and deploy the equivocating arts of his trade. The decommissioning argument, to take the most obvious instance, is insoluble at the moment. Republican and loyalist sectarians will not disarm - no band of fighting men in history has surrendered their weapons without being defeated on the battlefield.</p> <p>Yet Unionists, understandably, worry about guns being pulled out of barns and pointed at their heads again. The only way out is to embrace tokenism. Semtex explodes in a field for the cameras. The Northern Ireland Secretary pops up to say that the arms debate, thankfully, has been closed, and it is time to move on to the serious business of building a stable system of power-sharing.</p> <p>Conservatives, who would rather risk a war than rethink one of their prejudices, would damn such a resolution as a shabby compromise which left many guns in circulation. As, indeed, it would be. But compromise is all we can hope for in a stalemated conflict and it is also meant to be what Mandelson is best at. When Mo Mowlam was pulled out of Belfast and the Downing Street whisperers began what has since grown into the ugliest campaign of slander I have seen for a while, the line from Mandelson's gallant, anonymous friends was: 'Mo's touchy-feeliness was all very well, but what we need now is Peter's practical brain to close a deal.'</p> <p>Deal makers must be trusted. They must exude a false but necessary bonhomie. They must be able to work with all parties and submerge their personalities as they accept slights and concede ground in the greater interest of getting the business done. If you believe that Mandelson is a pragmatist who can rub along with anyone if realpolitik demands adaptability, listen to him describing his Cabinet colleagues in a 1998 TV interview with Michael Portillo.</p> <p>'They're always sitting on the fence. At the first sign of controversy they run for cover. They're always there, sort of creeping about in the undergrowth in order to maintain their position and keep their place in the Cabinet. Well, they're the majority. The minority are the people [with] the strong personalities, strong views who are not cowards, who are risk takers. You ( Mandelson said turning to Portillo ) have paid the price for being a risk-taker, and so have I.'</p> <p>After a large whisky and a quick repeating of the who the bloody hell does this man think he is question, we will move on to a rant identical in its petulance on his disastrous Dome, which was caught on camera by the BBC.</p> <p>'There are too many people in Britain who have forgotten what it is to be great as a country. Too many people have lost their ambition. Too many people just think that, well, we'll take second place to others who are better at doing these things_ It's just a mentality. Lack of confidence. Lack of a sense of bigness or greatness by some people in Britain. I think it's pathetic. I hate it.'</p> <p>Who after all, made Portillo 'pay the price' but the Enfield electorate by - impertinently - turning to Labour to get rid of him? Ministers creep because they endanger their career if they say a word out of line, while Blair gives Mandelson the licence to sneer at them on and off the record. The Dome is half empty not because of professional moaners, but because Mandelson and his clique did not have the intellectual and imaginative ability to create a popular spectacle.</p> <p>In his mind, however, the reverses he suffers are the fault of the envious Lilliputians who take a perverse delight in denying him his place in history. This is the character of a child or a megalomaniac. It is not, to put it at its kindest, a temperament well suited to hammering out a compromise.</p> <p>And so it has proved. Sinn Fein does not trust him. His reputation as the prince of spin has become a dangerous political handicap. Just before Christmas stories appeared saying the IRA was about to hand over arms. The IRA knew they weren't true and blamed Mandel son for planting them. Whether the accusation was well-grounded is irrelevant. Mandelson's past is his undoing. Every dubious report is blamed on him, a charge he does nothing to counter when he wastes valuable time berating Ulster reporters for every unauthorised comma and unhelpful clause that appears in their pieces.</p> <p>More serious is the suspicion of bad faith on the day he suspended the Stormont executive and returned the province to direct rule. Sinn Fein claim that Downing Street knew about the IRA offer to rethink its position on arms hours before Mandelson shut down devolution. It could have been sent to General John de Chastelain, the Canadian who is overseeing disarmament process. Time would have been bought. A breathing space found. But the executive's doors were locked in a grand gesture and a furious IRA pulled out of the negotiations.</p> <p>Unionists, too, can complain about high-handedness. The Patten report on reforming the RUC was released last month at the height of Unionist suspicion that the IRA was giving precious little in return for prisoner releases and Sinn Fein positions on the executive. It could have been delayed to a better moment. When Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman, criticised Patten in the Commons, Mandelson taunted him like a playground bully. He was, he said, 'very surprised that he chooses to say different things in public to what he has said in private'.</p> <p>Mandelson is meant to be a statesman handling historic and difficult negotiations. Yet he undermined Maginnis, a conciliator, under threat from the irreconcilables in his party, by betraying private conversations for a cheap debating point. Wise politicians simply do not do this. Then wise politicians don't gibber on TV about the pathetic timidity of their Cabinet colleagues.</p> <p>Mandelson more than anyone else has turned politics into a theatre where personalities matter more than issues. So be it. Sooner or later, if the Irish disaster continues, we will be entitled to ask if his personality is getting in the way of peace.</p> <p><b>The secret's out ... just don't tell anybody</b></p> <p>The security services are running riot. An anti-terrorism bill is sneaking its way through Parliament which will keep under-employed spooks in work by defining anyone who considers destroying property - environmentalists who pull up GM crops, say - as a 'terrorist', no less.</p> <p>Former MI5 agent David Shaylor, meanwhile, is trapped in Paris like an exile from a mad medieval court. His crime was not, as reported, to leak details of British knowledge of a Libyan coup attempt, but to reveal the far more dangerous secret that MI5 was a shambles, crippled by poisonous office politics, and so lost in far Right paranoia it regarded Jack Straw, Harriet Harman and - er, really? - Peter Mandelson as threats to the establishment.</p> <p>In Opposition, Labour had a solution. A public servant would avoid conviction under the suffocating terms of the Official Secrets Act if he or she could argue that disclosure was in the public interest. In 1988, Roy Hattersley said it was 'intolerable that the Government alone should be able to define and designate the individuals who are covered by the blanket ban' of secrecy.</p> <p>Admittedly, Labour has moved on, and Lord Hatters has become, through no fault of his own, a wild man of the Left and a dangerously seductive beacon to radical youth. Yet as late as 1996, His Eminence, Cardinal Irvine, Tony's chum who is now the unelected Lord High Chancellor, denounced the Official Secrets Act for its failure 'to recognise the public interest to know of abuses by government'.</p> <p>A few days ago in the Commons, David Heath, a Liberal Democrat, revived Labour's plans.

      "bodyText": "Every wised-up wit who mistakes knowingness for knowledge proclaims that Peter Mandelson is a gutless fixer; a master manipulator who will twist and dodge around the clock to keep the privileges of power and pelf. If a focus group tells him to drop a principle, it shatters on the ground in seconds. If an opinion poll tells him the public wants to hear that two plus two equals five, the Parliamentary Labour Party appears on the rolling news shows to denounce maths teachers as dinosaurs who must modernise or die. If only the idle stereotype were true. Ireland could do with the mythical Mandelson: a politician without ideological 'baggage', who can fudge and platitudinise and deploy the equivocating arts of his trade. The decommissioning argument, to take the most obvious instance, is insoluble at the moment. Republican and loyalist sectarians will not disarm - no band of fighting men in history has surrendered their weapons without being defeated on the battlefield. Yet Unionists, understandably, worry about guns being pulled out of barns and pointed at their heads again. The only way out is to embrace tokenism. Semtex explodes in a field for the cameras. The Northern Ireland Secretary pops up to say that the arms debate, thankfully, has been closed, and it is time to move on to the serious business of building a stable system of power-sharing. Conservatives, who would rather risk a war than rethink one of their prejudices, would damn such a resolution as a shabby compromise which left many guns in circulation. As, indeed, it would be. But compromise is all we can hope for in a stalemated conflict and it is also meant to be what Mandelson is best at. When Mo Mowlam was pulled out of Belfast and the Downing Street whisperers began what has since grown into the ugliest campaign of slander I have seen for a while, the line from Mandelson's gallant, anonymous friends was: 'Mo's touchy-feeliness was all very well, but what we need now is Peter's practical brain to close a deal.' Deal makers must be trusted. They must exude a false but necessary bonhomie. They must be able to work with all parties and submerge their personalities as they accept slights and concede ground in the greater interest of getting the business done. If you believe that Mandelson is a pragmatist who can rub along with anyone if realpolitik demands adaptability, listen to him describing his Cabinet colleagues in a 1998 TV interview with Michael Portillo. 'They're always sitting on the fence. At the first sign of controversy they run for cover. They're always there, sort of creeping about in the undergrowth in order to maintain their position and keep their place in the Cabinet. Well, they're the majority. The minority are the people [with] the strong personalities, strong views who are not cowards, who are risk takers. You ( Mandelson said turning to Portillo ) have paid the price for being a risk-taker, and so have I.' After a large whisky and a quick repeating of the who the bloody hell does this man think he is question, we will move on to a rant identical in its petulance on his disastrous Dome, which was caught on camera by the BBC. 'There are too many people in Britain who have forgotten what it is to be great as a country. Too many people have lost their ambition. Too many people just think that, well, we'll take second place to others who are better at doing these things_ It's just a mentality. Lack of confidence. Lack of a sense of bigness or greatness by some people in Britain. I think it's pathetic. I hate it.' Who after all, made Portillo 'pay the price' but the Enfield electorate by - impertinently - turning to Labour to get rid of him? Ministers creep because they endanger their career if they say a word out of line, while Blair gives Mandelson the licence to sneer at them on and off the record. The Dome is half empty not because of professional moaners, but because Mandelson and his clique did not have the intellectual and imaginative ability to create a popular spectacle. In his mind, however, the reverses he suffers are the fault of the envious Lilliputians who take a perverse delight in denying him his place in history. This is the character of a child or a megalomaniac. It is not, to put it at its kindest, a temperament well suited to hammering out a compromise. And so it has proved. Sinn Fein does not trust him. His reputation as the prince of spin has become a dangerous political handicap. Just before Christmas stories appeared saying the IRA was about to hand over arms. The IRA knew they weren't true and blamed Mandel son for planting them. Whether the accusation was well-grounded is irrelevant. Mandelson's past is his undoing. Every dubious report is blamed on him, a charge he does nothing to counter when he wastes valuable time berating Ulster reporters for every unauthorised comma and unhelpful clause that appears in their pieces. More serious is the suspicion of bad faith on the day he suspended the Stormont executive and returned the province to direct rule. Sinn Fein claim that Downing Street knew about the IRA offer to rethink its position on arms hours before Mandelson shut down devolution. It could have been sent to General John de Chastelain, the Canadian who is overseeing disarmament process. Time would have been bought. A breathing space found. But the executive's doors were locked in a grand gesture and a furious IRA pulled out of the negotiations. Unionists, too, can complain about high-handedness. The Patten report on reforming the RUC was released last month at the height of Unionist suspicion that the IRA was giving precious little in return for prisoner releases and Sinn Fein positions on the executive. It could have been delayed to a better moment. When Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman, criticised Patten in the Commons, Mandelson taunted him like a playground bully. He was, he said, 'very surprised that he chooses to say different things in public to what he has said in private'. Mandelson is meant to be a statesman handling historic and difficult negotiations. Yet he undermined Maginnis, a conciliator, under threat from the irreconcilables in his party, by betraying private conversations for a cheap debating point. Wise politicians simply do not do this. Then wise politicians don't gibber on TV about the pathetic timidity of their Cabinet colleagues. Mandelson more than anyone else has turned politics into a theatre where personalities matter more than issues. So be it. Sooner or later, if the Irish disaster continues, we will be entitled to ask if his personality is getting in the way of peace. The secret's out ... just don't tell anybody The security services are running riot. An anti-terrorism bill is sneaking its way through Parliament which will keep under-employed spooks in work by defining anyone who considers destroying property - environmentalists who pull up GM crops, say - as a 'terrorist', no less. Former MI5 agent David Shaylor, meanwhile, is trapped in Paris like an exile from a mad medieval court. His crime was not, as reported, to leak details of British knowledge of a Libyan coup attempt, but to reveal the far more dangerous secret that MI5 was a shambles, crippled by poisonous office politics, and so lost in far Right paranoia it regarded Jack Straw, Harriet Harman and - er, really? - Peter Mandelson as threats to the establishment. In Opposition, Labour had a solution. A public servant would avoid conviction under the suffocating terms of the Official Secrets Act if he or she could argue that disclosure was in the public interest. In 1988, Roy Hattersley said it was 'intolerable that the Government alone should be able to define and designate the individuals who are covered by the blanket ban' of secrecy. Admittedly, Labour has moved on, and Lord Hatters has become, through no fault of his own, a wild man of the Left and a dangerously seductive beacon to radical youth. Yet as late as 1996, His Eminence, Cardinal Irvine, Tony's chum who is now the unelected Lord High Chancellor, denounced the Official Secrets Act for its failure 'to recognise the public interest to know of abuses by government'. A few days ago in the Commons, David Heath, a Liberal Democrat, revived Labour's plans. Allow civil servants to tell the truth about official crimes and fraud, he said. The Home Office dismissed the idea that 'a person would have to decide whether he could get away' with leaking as 'hazardous'. Heath said it wouldn't be the whistleblower who decided, but a jury. But as we know, the political class that blethers about being for the many, not the few, wants to stop citizens making their minds up on juries. Baker's modest proposal was rejected as a dangerous menace and MI5 was reassured that Labour couldn't possibly threaten any criminal incompetent who pretended to be a defender of national security.",

      "body": "<p>'The Labour Party had promised so much after the war and had done so little for the working class that the working class were confused about even themselves. They didn't even understand what working class meant any more ... There was total social chaos: rioting, strikes of every kind of amenity you could think of ... People were fed up with the old way, the old way as not working ... the seed, the germ of the Sex Pistols was generated from all that.' </p> <p> John Lydon, formerly Johnny Rotten, interviewed in The Filth and the Fury. </p> <p>The past so the saying goes, is a foreign country. Some parts of the past, though, are a lot more foreign than others. In Julien Temple's forthcoming documentary feature film on the Sex Pistols, The Filth and the Fury, Britain in the mid-1970s looks not so much like another country as like another planet; a terminally blighted place where nothing works properly. </p> <p>Temple cleverly contextualises the group's turbulent story with images from the time: the 1976 Notting Hill carnival riot gives way to a montage of National Front marches; a manic Edward Heath conducting an orchestra is juxtaposed with burning buildings in Brixton and Belfast; Arthur Scargill calls for more strike action as Leicester Square fills with uncollected bags of rubbish. The Filth and the Fury jolts us into a renewed awareness of just how grim that dysfunctional decade was. </p> <p>And yet ... and yet, as John Lydon points out, it was the perfect time, the only time, for the phenomenon that was punk, and for the Sex Pistols in particular, to happen. </p> <p>In the Concise OED, punk is defined as 'worthless, rotten', and that is precisely how the pop establishment, and the establishment in general, regarded the punk movement, and how, crucially, punks regarded themselves. </p> <p>'You were told at school, at the Job Centre, that you didn't stand a chance and that you should just accept your lot,' Lydon elaborates now. 'You were constantly given a shoddy third-rate version of reality so you wouldn't be capable of questioning your future - 'cos you had none.' 'No Future' thus became a punk rallying cry, alongside the equally nihilistic 'Destroy!'. </p> <p>But, having made a dent in mainstream culture in a way that no other pop group, before or since, managed to do, the Sex Pistols ultimately ended up destroying only themselves. In one case, literally. </p> <p>The twenty-first anniversary of Sid Vicious's death by overdose passed without media comment a few weeks ago. In some ways, this was a good thing. His ignominious end, coming soon after the death of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen - for which he was facing a murder trial - led to his brief posthumous canonisation as the punk icon.</p> <p>But, Vicious - named after Johnny Rotten's pet hamster - was essentially a punk caricature, and only a minor player in the the various, often conflicting narratives that converged around the Sex Pistols. </p> <p>If punk was pop's last big exclamation mark, it was also, with the possible exception of gangsta rap, its most problematic genre. Punk preached nihilism and, paradoxically, was self-empowering; it celebrated boredom but reignited rock'n'roll's long buried primal power-- the power to fire up the imagination of its disaffected audience, and simultaneously provoke extreme distaste, even fear, in others. </p> <p>Throughout their short, volatile existence, the Sex Pistols - and their manager, Malcolm McLaren, in particular - were adept at operating in some ill-defined hinterland between politics and pure provocation. They swore on prime-time television, they mocked the monarchy during jubilee year, they stumbled from one record contract to another, trailing outrage and odium - and wads of cash - in their wake, and, somewhere along the way, as if by accident, they mutated into one of the greatest rock'n'roll bands of all time. </p> <p>Their recorded legacy consists of just four singles and one album, the aptly titled Never Mind The Bollocks (Here's The Sex Pistols), but in that handful of songs they challenged all notions of what constituted a pop song. Later, US critic Greil Marcus would write of them: 'In tones that pop music had never produced, demands were made that pop music never made.' </p> <p>With each new, beautifully orchestrated, widely reported outrage, they seemed to be saying, 'We are your worst nightmare and, yet you - England - spawned us' and, more provocatively, 'What are you going to do about it?' </p> <p>It was difficult,nearly 25 years on, to overestimate just how divisive the Sex Pistols' music was. After the group's expletive-punctuated appearance on the Bill Grundy-hosted Today television show, a Conservative councillor, Bernard Brook Partridge, called them 'the antithesis of humankind' and concluded: 'The whole world would be vastly improved by their total and utter nonexistence'. (James Holmes, an Essex lorry driver, found brief tabloid fame for having kicked in the screen of his television set: 'I can swear as well as anyone,' he told the Daily Mirror , 'but I don't want this sort of muck coming into my home at teatime.') </p> <p>Newly arrived in London, and living in a squat in Willesden, I remember how the Pistols' TV appearance divided my household in a microcosm of the national debate that raged the next day. I knew which side I was on. For the first time, I had found a pop group who had not come to me second-hand via older lads' record collections and reminiscences.</p> <p> I tried in vain to see the Sex Pistols play live but, post-Grundy, it was an impossibility. The group's tour to promote their first single, 'Anarchy in the UK', turned into a debacle as, in town after town, shows were cancelled or venues surrounded by pickets of protesting parents and councillors. Suddenly, as jubilee year approached, the Sex Pistols were the ogre at the feast. 'It is no fault of ours that this thing has come to Caerphilly,' a pastor informed his terrified flock. </p> <p>How could a gang of self-confessed losers incite such intense feelings? What was it about punk, and the Sex Pistols in particular, that placed rock'n'roll, for the last time, at the epicentre of cultural and social upheaval? </p> <p>Part of the answer, at least, lies in timing. The Sex Pistols were products of their blighted time as much as the Beatles were products of the optimistic mid-Sixties. Pop, at its best, can be an uncannily prescient medium, and just as the Beatles chimed with the coming of the rejuvenated Labour government under Harold Wilson, the Pistols signalled the coming of the bleak, hard years of Thatcherism. If Merseybeat was born out of optimism, punk grew out of frustration and boredom. The Sex Pistols, in particular, turned boredom and frustration into an art form. 'We're so pretty, oh so pretty, we're vacant', they sang, tauntingly, 'and we don't care.' </p> <p>But they did care. Or, to be more precise, Rotten cared. He cared about his friend, Vicious, to the extent that, 20 years on, he bursts into tears of anger and regret when forced to speak on camera about the 'stupid, senseless' nature of that so-called punk death. He cared too that his songs, his persona, were constantly misinterpreted, or worse still, utterly misunderstood. </p> <p>And, unsurprisingly given the restrictions imposed on his life by his sudden infamy, he cared for his own sanity. 'Under the stress of being national scapegoats, relationships between Lydon and McLaren went into a nose dive from which they never recovered,' records Jon Savage in his punk history, England's Dreaming . 'McLaren was unable and unwilling to give them the emotional support - even nursemaiding - they now more than ever required.' </p> <p>'He's hopeless at dealing with people,' Lydon says, 'he couldn't care less about you. \"Hullo, I'm having a nervous breakdown\". \"Go away, I'm busy scandalising you in the press.\"' </p> <p>Received wisdom suggests that McLaren, not Lydon, was the Pistols' main motivating force. What seems more likely is that they were both equally crucial, and that, more pertinently, they needed each other more than ever as they grew to loathe each other. </p> <p>McLaren's art school apprenticeship and understanding of the politics of provocation was crucial. He was, first and foremost, an opportunist, who cadged his never less than vague politics from anarcho-art collectives such as the Situationists, whose slogans - 'be reasonable, demand the impossible' - ended up emblazoned on his and Vivienne Westwood's range of punk clothing. </p> <p>McLaren liked to refer to the Pistols as his 'little artful dodgers' - drummer Paul Cook and guitarist Steve Jones, the proles who balanced out Rotten's self-taught intellectualism, had stolen an array of instruments and amplification that would have done a stadium rock band proud before he met them - and his 'sexy young assassins', the inference being that he had made them in his own image, for his own ends. 'You don't make me,' a still miffed Rotten asserts today. 'I am me. There is a difference.' </p> <p>Onstage, and off though, it was Rotten's difference, his effortless otherness, that mesmerised. From the start, his second-generation Irishness and fierce intelligence set him apart. He arrived in McLaren's shop in 1975, his clothes ripped and held together with safety pins, his hair brutally shorn, wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words 'I hate' scrawled in felt tip above the group's name. Rotten's punk persona, then, was in place long before McLaren marketed the look, and was constructed from a whole range of influences: Olivier as Richard III, Charles Laughton as Quasimodo, the great Max Wall, the not-so-great Arthur Askey and Ken Dodd - 'just bizarre characters who, somehow or other, through all their deformities, managed to achieve something'. </p> <p>His stare, withering and psychotic, came with the after-affects of the meningitis that almost killed him as a child. His singing voice, though, came from God knows where. There is simply no precedent for the shrill, gleeful, mocking tone that emerges from the cavalry charge of guitars and clattering drums that introduces 'Anarchy in the UK'. </p> <p>Other rock singers may have specialised in sexual provocation and/or intimations of revolution, but Rotten cornered the market in pure, unmitigated disgust. What disgusted him most, on 'Anarchy in the UK' and its follow-up, 'God Save the Queen', was his birthplace: the England that had formed him and his grotesque alter-ego. 'I thought it was the UK,' he taunts on 'Anarchy', before his mockery turns to scorn - 'Or just another country ... another council tenancy'. It remains one of the most dismissive moments in postwar British culture. </p> <p>Though hardly their greatest song, it was the second single, 'God Save the Queen', that proved the Sex Pistols' most audacious moment. At a time when the whole country seemed gripped by a desperate royal fever in preparation for the jubilee, the single - backed by a poster campaign that portrayed the Queen with a safety pin through her lip - took McLaren's strategy of provocation as far as it could go.</p> <p>Though banned by both radio and TV, it reached No 1 on its first week of release - charts were published in the trade papers with a blank space opposite the top slot, as if mere acknowledgment of the fact might cause offence - and became the national anti-anthem. 'We were the maypole around which England danced,' Lydon tells Julien Temple, 'and if they had hung us at Traitor's Gate, it would have been applauded by 56 million.' </p> <p>Instead, embracing Brooke Partridge's decree that the group 'would be vastly improved by sudden death', a gang of self-styled royalists ambushed Rotten on the street, smashing his face with a broken bottle and slicing his arms and legs with a machete. Suddenly, it seemed, the Pistols had become the target for the simmering and hitherto aimless violence that was abroad in Britain at the time. </p> <p>Almost 25 years later, the unrepentant punk still seems bemused by the outrage he provoked. In The Filth and the Fury , an older and wiser, but still effortlessly sarcastic Lydon spells out what was only hinted at in his songs, his stance: 'You don't write \"God Save the Queen\" because you hate the English race, you write it because you love them and you're fed up with them being mistreated.' </p> <p>Now, there's the rub. The Sex Pistols, like John Lennon before them, were essentially a working-class group, their songs a proletarian cri de coeur. Their key subtext was not boredom or disaffection, but betrayal. For a brief liberating moment, they shoved all the anger and frustration of their class back in the face of those who would have consigned them to a life of dull, desperate struggle. They were, in the words of that other great punk scribe, Mark E. Smith of The Fall, 'the prole art threat' made horribly, powerfully real, and, in class-ridden Britain, every one of their songs hit a raw nerve. No one, not the Beatles before them, nor Oasis after them, ever articulated the politics and the gut-anger of betrayal so powerfully in a pop song. </p> <p>Now, Jones plays session guitar for various US bands, Cook lives quietly in his native west London, original bassist Glen Matlock had a brief deal with Creation Records before they ceased trading recently. </p> <p>McLaren, ever the maverick, is standing for Mayor of London, backed by Creation founder Alan McGee, on a ticket that makes no mention of his once extraordinarily lucrative - at least for him - Cash for Chaos manifesto. And John Lydon is holed up in Los Angeles, where he hosts a cable show called Rotten TV, and plays the cartoon punk whenever and however it suits him. Really, though, there was nowhere else for any of them to go after punk. 'No future,' howled Johnny Rotten back then, little knowing that he was singing ultimately of himself. In pop terms, too, he got it wrong. There was, of course, a future; it's just that, after the Sex Pistols, it was always going to be a pale and bloodless one.</p>",

Credits: The Spy Who Loved Me , Country Life </p> <p> <strong> Barrie Keeffe: </strong> In the Sixties I used to be a journalist in the East End and I met a lot of gangsters, including the Krays. The grand plans of Harold Shand [London gangster, played by Bob Hoskins] were inspired by them. I was living in Greenwich when I wrote the script. I could see the Docklands from my flat and all the building expansion that was taking place. Then one night I met an Irish republican guy in a pub and after talking to him an idea formed in my mind. My pitch was terrorism meets gangsterism. The Long Good Friday finally came together one night during a late-night chat with Barry Hanson. We were talking about how much we liked gangster films and how great it would be to make a Humphrey Bogart-style movie set in London. </p> <p> <strong> Barry Hanson: </strong> I originally commissioned the story when I was at Thames Television in the mid-Seventies, as the first part of a series called The Last Thriller. Then I moved to Black Lion, basically a subsidiary of the Grade organisation [giant British entertainment group] with a three-picture deal. </p> <p> <strong> Barrie Keeffe: </strong> I wrote the first draft over the Easter weekend in three days. It was called 'The Paddy Factor'. That's the slang term the police and the armed forces used when they suspect Irish terrorist involvement. </p> <p> <strong> John Mackenzie: </strong> Oh God, that was a bit weird because the title gave away the whole story. But that was before we developed the script. Initially the IRA theme was peripheral, but the element that interested me was the clash between capitalist thug and committed terrorists. I came up with The Long Good Friday since the action was set over the Easter weekend. It was only meant to be a working title but it stuck. </p> <p> <strong> Bob Hoskins: </strong> When I made The Long Good Friday I'd reached a point where I was pissed off with what was going on in England and I wanted to do something about it. Harold had a morality which had limits, he had violence which had limits. But he was up against idealists who had no limits. The IRA were fighting for a cause. But criminals are just fighting for power, for money and that'll only go so far. At the time I felt like I was up against a totally impossible regime, the Thatcherite regime. </p> <p> <strong> Barrie Keeffe: </strong> Reworking the script was a collaborative thing between John, Barry, Bob and me. We worked furiously to get the thing done. I remember I weighed myself when the script was done and I'd lost about two stone. One night Bob locked me in the office overnight so I would finish a couple of scenes. He came back in the morning and let me out but he didn't apologise [laughs]. I don't think that's in his nature. </p> <p> <strong> Bryan Marshall: </strong> When I first read the screenplay I thought, 'My God, it's a wordy script.' Usually when you close your eyes in the cinema and listen to the soundtrack there isn't really much dialogue. But with The Long Good Friday there was plenty of Barrie's brutal dialogue, which made the film. </p> <p> <strong> Barrie Keeffe: </strong> There were moments in the film which were directly inspired by real stories. The crucifixion scene [a very graphic nailing of a gangster to the floor] was something that happened to someone I knew. I actually saw the guy after his ordeal. It was quite horrendous. The Krays had nailed him down to the floor for eight hours. He was only a little gangster but he had crossed the big boys and that's what happened to him. I felt frightened meeting those type of people. When they've got your phone number and they know where you live, it becomes scary. </p> <p> <strong> John Mackenzie: </strong> Barrie knew the East End scene. He introduced me to a few people who knew people and I got to meet a few gangsters. Some of them hung around the set during filming and were good enough to carry a small role. They were invaluable to have around as they helped create an atmosphere. They would sometime come up to me with little tips as well. They'd say, 'Not that I know, mind you, but I don't think he would do it like that. He wouldn't use the knife like that or hold the gun that way.' </p> <p> <strong> Bryan Marshall: </strong> Some people who were involved in the film came via the crime fraternity. There were some faces that I didn't recognise. They were real villains. They didn't have much to say for themselves. There were some pretty heavy faces hanging around and I wasn't about to go up to them and ask what they were doing there. </p> <p> <strong> Barrie Keeffe: </strong> I think crime and film industry represented two different arms of showbiz. I think the gangsters liked being around actors and vice versa. They loved it. </p> <p> <strong> Bob Hoskins: </strong> In that scene when Harold gives out the guns to his crew, a lot of those guys are the real thing. I started shouting at some of my mates in one scene, and the gangsters told me to stop shouting. 'Those guys know who you are,' they told me. </p> <p> <strong> Barrie Keeffe: </strong> I wrote the script with Bob in mind. We were both working in fringe theatre when I wrote it. We were both so broke we were sleeping in the theatre on a rat-infested floor in our sleeping bags. I told him the idea and he was desperate to play the part. </p> <p> <strong> John Mackenzie: </strong> Bob had an amazing raw talent. He was fairly new to films, although he had done Pennies From Heaven on TV. I remember just giving him his head in some scenes. There was a very long scene when he kills a guy with a bottle at the end of a long, angry speech. After the first take I told him, 'Do it again, but this time don't pause and sit on the edge of the bed, just keep going.' He said, 'What, did I sit down?' He didn't know. He was just following his instincts. </p> <p> <strong> Bryan Marshall: </strong> He was just this ball of energy. The role was perfect for him. When I had scenes opposite him I never tried to match his intensity or top him. There was a scene which was cut from the final film when he confronts me in my office. He came in screaming and thrust a phone at my face so hard he was practically pushing it down my throat. </p> <p> <strong> John Mackenzie: </strong> The Grade organisation was very big and we were just an offshot of that. The film only cost about \u00a3900,000. They never saw the script and weren't really concerned with us. The shit hit the fan when they finally saw it. They were horror-struck. They thought the IRA would bomb the cinemas. </p> <p> <strong> Barry Hanson: </strong> It was basically not Lord Grade but his people who saw the film, and were horrified. They wanted to cut out all the violence and IRA references. While we were editing our version they were editing their own version in the basement, for television. The Irish content made them very afraid. The film was being made against the backdrop of the collapse of the Grade organisation because of the failure of Raise The Titanic. </p> <p> <strong> John Mackenzie: </strong> They even hired an actor from Wolverhampton to re-dub Bob's lines because they thought a Brummie accent would sound better to American audiences. Bob was incandescent when he found out. We threatened to take them to court to get the rights to the film. We assembled a great list of people, including Alec Guinness, to be expert witnesses. I think the Grade organisation feared the bad publicity and didn't want to annoy establishment figures like Guinness so they agreed to sell it to Handmade Films. Bob was our contact with them. But it all meant the film's release was delayed for over a year. </p> <p> <strong> Bob Hoskins: </strong> I met Eric Idle at a party and I thought he must have a pot of money after Life of Brian, so I got him to take a look at our picture. </p> <p> <strong> Bryan Marshall: </strong> At the time I didn't attach too much importance to the film. I had no idea it would become a cult movie. That hit me when I was having a drink in an actor's pub in Soho. A journalist came up to me and said he had just been to a press showing at the National Film Theatre where he had seen me in one of the best British films he had ever seen in his life. It had been so long since I'd made the film, I said, 'What film are you talking about?' I'd forgotten all about it. </p> <p> <strong> Barrie Keeffe: </strong> I was VIP host at the Millenium Dome on New Year's Eve. I had to escort Northern Island Secretary Peter Mandelson at one stage. He must have recognised something when he saw my name tag and he asked me what I had done in the past. When I told him I had written the film about the IRA taking over London he gave me a funny look and walked away pretty fast. </p> <p> <strong> Barry Hanson: </strong> There aren't many gangster films that have the ferocity of The Long Good Friday . It said a lot about England and was quite a lot of fun as well - its imitators always lacked the wit. </p> <p> <strong> Barrie Keeffe: </strong> I'm pleased and proud of the film, but I've never seen it in the cinema. My wife was dying of cancer when it opened so I spent the night of the premi\u00e8re at the hospital. I've got a video tape, but the premi\u00e8re for the re-release will be the first time I've ever seen it in the cinema. </p> <p> <strong> John Mackenzie: </strong> It seemed to get much stronger reviews in the States than over here. At the time I felt it deserved more respect. It's got a great deal of substance and works on different levels. The enduring popularity is very gratifying, though. I haven't seen it for 18 years myself, but I do remember it's got some great lines. </p> <p>\u0095 The Long Good Friday is re-released on 3 March</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The Zeitgeist takes time to reach Hollywood. Developing films is a drawn-out process, and trends come and go before Tinseltown deems them worthy of preservation on celluloid. For instance, it was only last year that the movies discovered raves. So it is no great shock - two months into the new century - to hear that Elizabeth Wurtzel's autobiography Prozac Nation, a supremely Nineties book about a great Nineties obsession, is finally going to be made into a film.</p> <p> It also makes sense that the star/executive producer of Prozac Nation will be Christina Ricci. Partly because Ricci has always talked frankly about her teenage traumas and eating disorders, but also because her career is shadowing Winona Ryder's. And Ryder's current film - due here in March - is Girl, Interrupted, based on Susanna Kaysen's memoir of being institutionalised for borderline personality disorder in her teens.</p> <p> Ricci and Ryder played sisters in Richard Benjamin's Mermaids (1990); since then Ricci has made her name as a gothy girl in a supernatural comedy (The Addams Family) as has Ryder (Beetlejuice), starred in a film hailed as a sharp-tongued riposte to current teen movie trends (The Opposite Of Sex and Heathers respectively) and gone willowy blonde as Johnny Depp's love interest in a Tim Burton movie (Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands). Now Ricci too will get to play an aspiring writer who is hospitalised. In theory, Prozac Nation should be a more coherent film than Girl, Interrupted. The film of Kaysen's book is stranded between decades and attitudes towards therapy. </p> <p>The film is set in the late Sixties - as frequent, unsubtle references to Vietnam and Martin Luther King remind us - but designed for a contemporary audience. Initially, the film seems to be following the counter-cultural approach to mental illness: the One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, R.D. Laing-for-dummies version. We are meant to think that it is not the women locked away in these cold, bare rooms who are mad, it is the society that put them there. As Girl, Interrupted's director, James Mangold, puts it: '\"Crazy\" is measured by our adherence to what society expects us to do, how we're supposed to act, what is appropriate. In many ways our sanity is determined by our commitment to playing by the rules.'</p> <p>So these are innocent girls in a world of asylums, bureaucratic doctors, patients pinned down and forced to have ECT against their will, poor little rich girls like Sylvia Plath or Edie Sedgwick committed by families who just want a problem off their hands. It is a vision of the terrors of the mental health profession that reaches its most extreme cinematic form in Frances, a biopic that was critically adored when it came out in 1982 and has been largely forgotten since. </p> <p> As the film has it, Frances Farmer (played by Jessica Lange) was a rising star of the Forties destroyed by a Hollywood that could not handle her left-wing views, then left to rot in asylums that could only drive a sane person mad; finally, she was lobotomised. The moral: if the drugs are not strong enough to suppress whatever individuality you retain after being locked away, the medically anointed forces of repression will physically remove your mind. As One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest tells us, you would have to be mad to trust a nurse, let alone a doctor. </p> <p> So when Susanna (Ryder) arrives at the private clinic early in Girl, Interrupted, the first thing she learns is how to pretend to take her medication - this seems to be the only sane thing to do. But halfway through, the film seems to change its mind. Lisa (Angelina Jolie) - the untameable girl, the film's equivalent of McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) in Cuckoo's Nest - is shown to be a destructive rather than a liberating figure. </p> <p> Susanna turns away from her, makes her peace with the clinic's staff, and works with them to regain her mental health and happiness. The film leaves us with the impression that the diagnosis might have been wrong but Susanna had been genuinely ill. Which is where it chimes with the contemporary take on these issues. When Ryder was 20, she checked herself into hospital because of extreme anxiety attacks.</p> <p> 'They were totally irrational and terribly frustrating because I couldn't explain them to myself, and I couldn't explain them to other people. I really felt like I was losing my mind.' Getting treatment seems to have been a good thing. A quick stay somewhere is an obligatory part of contemporary celebrity life. Think back a couple of years to when it became clear that Britain's best star-spotting hang-out was the Priory rather than the Met Bar. Drug rehab, alcohol rehab, treatment for eating disorders or sex addiction or phobias or plain old depression - both the stigma and the fear have long gone. With Betty Ford figuring as the patron saint of a sobered-up LA, there is no shame in asking for help. </p> <p> A breakdown makes a mid-career collapse much more respectable than admitting to a string of flop movies or albums. More seriously, the emptying of the old asylums - the process is euphemistically known as care in the community in Britain - has made romantic, Laingian notions of madness look horribly misguided. So Girl, Interrupted is a bridge between two traditions. And while Prozac Nation is no bright, happy tale of instant solutions, it insists that anti-depressants can save your life. The message is that, however nasty doctors might have been in the Fifties and Sixties, with today's pharmacology hiding your meds underneath your tongue is counterproductive. </p> <p> And because nothing happens on its own in Hollywood, there is another pair of (unlikely) clinic-based movies on the way. The first is 28 Days, a comedy in which an improbably cast Sandra Bullock plays a newspaper columnist who crashes her car while drunk- and gets sent to rehab. The therapeutic process is gently satirised, but at the end of the film it is a cleaned-up Sandra who finds the right (non-substance abusing) guy. </p> <p> There have been rehab movies before, notably Clean And Sober in 1988, one of the few highlights in the strange career of Michael Keaton. It's an impressively complex account of a man trying to get over drink and drug addiction, although it helps when your therapist has the immense gravitas and innate wisdom that belongs to any character played by Morgan Freeman. 28 Days will have to work hard to improve on it.</p> <p>A far stranger contribution to the rehab genre is the film whose working title is D-Tox, although it has been called a number of other things, including the more obvious/sensible Detox and The Outpost. Sylvester Stallone plays a traumatised FBI agent sent to recover at a suitably remote clinic catering exclusively for troubled law enforcement operatives. But just as Sly is beginning to get over his nightmares, there is a blizzard and someone starts picking off the patients one by one - and only Sly seems to know what to do. Pundits have pointed out that the role - psychological trauma plus action - seems custom made for Nicolas Cage, not the increasingly lumbering Stallone.</p> <p> What has not been so widely discussed is that the plot is almost exactly the same as that of a late episode of The Avengers. But the point remains that even Stallone characters are ready to admit they need rest, therapy and the attention of experts. The old take on psychiatric hospitals is due at least one more outing. I was wondering why Winona Ryder had not tried to adapt The Bell Jar, rather than the less famous and less influential Girl, Interrupted. One reason is that there was a disastrous 1979 film version of Plath's book. It was made by Larry Peerce, whose sole claim to fame is the 1969 adaptation of Philip Roth's Goodbye, Columbus, which launched Ali McGraw's career. Both Peerce and his adaptation of Plath's novel vanished. But the idea of a Plath biopic remains a favourite with Hollywood women, Gwyneth Paltrow being the frontrunner for the role. </p> <p>Meg Ryan has been touting a script around for years, but must be too old for the role now. Just as well, perhaps, given that Ryan expressed her interest in these terms: 'I think Sylvia Plath speaks to woman forever, but especially now, because more than ever we are these multi-tasking people with a lot to accomplish - and on top of everything else, she was a mother. To be an artist and a mother - those are two very difficult things to reconcile.' So it looks as if Paltrow - like Ryder, naturally skinny and vulnerable looking - will be our final guide to the pre-Prozac universe.</p> <p>\u0095 'Girl, Interrupted' is released on 24 March</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Zeitgeist takes time to reach Hollywood. Developing films is a drawn-out process, and trends come and go before Tinseltown deems them worthy of preservation on celluloid. For instance, it was only last year that the movies discovered raves. So it is no great shock - two months into the new century - to hear that Elizabeth Wurtzel's autobiography Prozac Nation, a supremely Nineties book about a great Nineties obsession, is finally going to be made into a film. It also makes sense that the star/executive producer of Prozac Nation will be Christina Ricci. Partly because Ricci has always talked frankly about her teenage traumas and eating disorders, but also because her career is shadowing Winona Ryder's. And Ryder's current film - due here in March - is Girl, Interrupted, based on Susanna Kaysen's memoir of being institutionalised for borderline personality disorder in her teens. Ricci and Ryder played sisters in Richard Benjamin's Mermaids (1990); since then Ricci has made her name as a gothy girl in a supernatural comedy (The Addams Family) as has Ryder (Beetlejuice), starred in a film hailed as a sharp-tongued riposte to current teen movie trends (The Opposite Of Sex and Heathers respectively) and gone willowy blonde as Johnny Depp's love interest in a Tim Burton movie (Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands). Now Ricci too will get to play an aspiring writer who is hospitalised. In theory, Prozac Nation should be a more coherent film than Girl, Interrupted. The film of Kaysen's book is stranded between decades and attitudes towards therapy. The film is set in the late Sixties - as frequent, unsubtle references to Vietnam and Martin Luther King remind us - but designed for a contemporary audience. Initially, the film seems to be following the counter-cultural approach to mental illness: the One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, R.D. Laing-for-dummies version. We are meant to think that it is not the women locked away in these cold, bare rooms who are mad, it is the society that put them there. As Girl, Interrupted's director, James Mangold, puts it: '\"Crazy\" is measured by our adherence to what society expects us to do, how we're supposed to act, what is appropriate. In many ways our sanity is determined by our commitment to playing by the rules.' So these are innocent girls in a world of asylums, bureaucratic doctors, patients pinned down and forced to have ECT against their will, poor little rich girls like Sylvia Plath or Edie Sedgwick committed by families who just want a problem off their hands. It is a vision of the terrors of the mental health profession that reaches its most extreme cinematic form in Frances, a biopic that was critically adored when it came out in 1982 and has been largely forgotten since. As the film has it, Frances Farmer (played by Jessica Lange) was a rising star of the Forties destroyed by a Hollywood that could not handle her left-wing views, then left to rot in asylums that could only drive a sane person mad; finally, she was lobotomised.

      "body": "<p> Supermarkets have become masters of disguising the real truth about meat. By 'truth' I mean the fact that it was once a living animal. Skilled butchery and clever packaging now successfully hide the original shape of limb or organ, so that the meat we are about to put in our basket bears little resemblance to any part of a furry four-legged beast. Truth told, the more obvious a cut of meat's original function - liver, kidney, trotter or tongue - the less popular it is. Despite the fact that these are often the most toothsome cuts of all. </p> <p>Even the most cunning of supermarket butchers cannot disguise an oxtail. I concede that, once hacked into neat chunks and safely imprisoned in clingfilm on a sky-blue Styrofoam tray, it is not actually still swishing the flies away, but the thing is quite obviously a tail. Cooked slowly with wine and herbs, an oxtail is a delectable cut, as one might expect from a piece of meat that is cooked on the bone and surrounded by aromatics. </p> <p>I am not keen on brown beef. I like my beef pink to bloody, which is why I only ever eat it as a steak or, once in a blue moon, as a prime roast. Once its inside has lost any hint of a blush, I see no point in continuing. But the sticky, Marmite-like quality of oxtail has always appealed. Perhaps Bovril would be more appropriate. It is not just my soft spot for the culinary underdog (those cuts of meat that are regularly brushed aside in favour of the pallid and inoffensive chicken breast or escalope), it is more that I particularly like meat with an accompanying sauce that has a gelatinous quality. Something that makes me lick the corners of my mouth. </p> <p>Spring always appears a good month later in the kitchen than it does in the garden, and despite the crocuses and sticky buds in my garden, it is still firmly winter and I continue to crave meats that keep out the cold. I am thinking of those gelatinous cuts cooked slowly on the bone: a neck of lamb stewed with haricot beans; a lamb shank with garlic and mushrooms; a ham hock with cabbage and juniper or, perhaps, a past-it pigeon with bacon and red wine. Bones add more than just flavour. They add richness, body, viscosity and savour to the accompanying sauce - so essential when there is a touch of frost on the ground. </p> <p>Horror stories of oxtail abound. The usual one is the accusation of toughness. For once, this is almost certainly down to the cook rather than the animal or its butcher. A tail needs moist heat and a slow oven if it is to be tender. You need time to get the bones to do their stuff. Ideally, the meat should be so tender you could eat it with a spoon. Timing isn't especially crucial here. Half an hour extra in the oven may be the end the story for a decent roast rib, but will mean little or nothing to an oxtail. Surrounded by red wine or dark beer, onions, garlic, celery or celeriac, mustard, juniper, thyme and bay, it can safely be left to get on with things while we prune the roses or write that letter. </p> <p>I have heard tales of gallons of fat coming from an oxtail stew, yet only this week I knocked up a large roasting tin of the tackiest, glossiest and almost black braised tail with little or no fat to skim off at all. The liquid - in this case a bottle of Rioja - had bubbled away to a thick, collagen-based syrup. This is rare, I gather, and was probably due to an especially lean tail or to my having set the oven a bit high. Usually there is a layer on the top of a braise or stew that needs removing. This is where planning comes in. A stew made the day before can not only have its cold fat lifted away with ease, but its flavour will be all the more interesting. I have no freezer, but I am reliably informed an oxtail stew is something that freezes extraordinarily well. </p> <p>And there's a surprise, too. You can fiddle around with an oxtail stew, taking every possible care and attending to the smallest of details, yet the end result will be almost indistinguishable from one where you have browned the meat and vegetables, poured in the liquid - be it beer, stock, wine or even water - and chucked it forgetfully into the oven. The only trick worth knowing is that this is one dish where it is better, even in the height of winter, to remove the fat. </p> <p>You can make substitutions all over the shop. For oxtail, you could read lamb shank or even neck chops. You can swap red wine for white and Guinness for any dark beer. Chuck the carrots in favour of parsnips; use turnips in lieu of celery and add tomatoes instead of mushrooms. Neither recipe here will come to grief if you leave out the garlic or get a notion to throw in a few juniper berries. The magic lies as much in the collagen tucked away in the bones as it does in the details of seasoning. That is what gives body to the juices, and coats the hunks of bone and meagre flesh with the sticky, intense gloss that is the whole point of cooking this thing from the wrong end of a bull. </p> <p> <strong> Sticky oxtail with celery and orange</strong> </p> <p> Serves 2, with seconds </p> <p>1 oxtail, cut into joints </p> <p>a little flour for dusting the oxtail </p> <p>cayenne </p> <p>dry mustard powder </p> <p>a thick slice of butter </p> <p>2 large winter carrots, peeled and roughly chopped </p> <p>2 large onions, peeled and roughly chopped </p> <p>2 ribs of celery, chopped </p> <p>4 whole cloves of garlic, peeled </p> <p>4 or 5 bay leaves </p> <p>a bottle of ballsy red wine, such as a Rioja </p> <p>2 long strips of orange peel </p> <p>Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 5. Trim and discard any particularly large lumps of fat from the meat, then toss each joint in flour that you have seasoned with the cayenne, dry mustard powder and some ground black pepper. Melt the butter in a roasting tin over a moderate heat and seal the meat in it, turning each piece as it colours, then add the carrots, onions, celery and garlic and let it all colour a little. By this time, the butter will have all but disappeared. </p> <p>Tuck in the bay leaves, pour over the wine and lower in the orange peel before bringing it to the boil. Transfer, uncovered to the oven and leave well alone for an hour, when the exposed surface of the meat will be distinctly brown. Turn the meat over and leave for about 45 minutes. What you will now have is lumps of glossy, tender meat and a few spoonfuls of sticky sauce. Serve with mashed potato or swede. </p> <p> <strong> Oxtail braised with mushrooms and Guinness</strong> </p> <p> A juicier affair, though just as straightforward. Serves 4 </p> <p>2 oxtails, jointed and trimmed of any large pieces of fat </p> <p>a little flour </p> <p>50g butter </p> <p>5 medium-sized red onions, peeled and chopped </p> <p>125g smoked pancetta or bacon, cubed or cut into strips </p> <p>3 cloves of garlic, peeled and halved </p> <p>1 level tbsp of brown sugar </p> <p>440ml Guinness </p> <p>800ml vegetable stock or water </p> <p>200g open mushrooms, quartered </p> <p>2 or 3 bay leaves </p> <p>Set the oven at 180 C/gas mark 5. Shake the oxtail in the flour seasoned with a little salt and black pepper, then brown it in the butter in a roasting tin or casserole over a moderate to high heat. Introduce the onions and pancetta and let them colour a little before adding the garlic. Sprinkle over the brown sugar and stir as it melts, then pour over the Guinness and stock and, as it comes to the boil, drop in the quartered mushrooms. It is tempting to fry the mushrooms with the rest of the vegetables, but resist - they will only soak up all of your butter and the fat from the pancetta, and you will have to add more. </p> <p>At this point, things will look unpromising, with the mushrooms floating in the beer and the meat standing proud, but don't worry: it has a long way to go yet. Drop in the bay leaves and put the dish in the oven, leaving it alone for an hour. </p> <p>After an hour, turn each knob of meat over in the liquor and return it to the oven for a further 50 minutes. You could serve the braise now, but it will be better, I think, if you can bear to let it cool; you can refrigerate it overnight and scrape off the surface fat with a spoon. There is plenty of richness in the sauce - the fat is just not needed. </p> <p>Whether you are reheating (do it slowly and let it simmer for at least 20 minutes) or serving it from go, you will need some accompanying starch. Half an hour or so before the meat is likely to be ready, get some potatoes or Jerusalem artichokes on to boil or steam. You want them to be quite floury and crumbly so they will soak up much of the juice. Some greens would be good here, too - kale, perhaps, or some winter cabbage. </p>",

      "body": "<p>I wish Clematis cirrhosa balearica had a familiar name rather than a label sounding like bleary liver damage. The unpronounceable spelling mitigates against it before you begin. There is a variety called C cirrhosa 'Freckles' which is more of a nickname, along the rather strained lines of 'Tubby Dorset' or 'Bunny Norfolk', but at least there is an attempt at familiarity. 'Freckles' could be an old schoolfriend with an embarrassing tag, but C cirrhosa balearica will always be the key that locks you into a formal relationship. </p> <p>The real point is that the name does nothing to explain the plant in terms of emotional intelligence. And yet, at this time of year, any plant that flowers at all should be celebrated, and if it is a climber that flowers with an extraordinary fragile beauty and smells fabulous to boot, then we should all be in on the act, rubbing shoulders on careless first-name terms. </p> <p>While we are riding the hobbyhorse of nomenclature, let's begin at the beginning. First there was C cirrhosa, green of leaf and with charming cream-coloured bell-flowers hanging shyly half-hidden by the oval leaves, which turned a tint of bronze in autumn. It comes from Spain and Portugal and right across the Mediterranean, which tells a lot about how it wants to be grown. In this country it is happiest in a warm, sheltered spot. Then came C cirrhosa balearica, the leaves of which are finely cut to the point of filigree. More flowers, too, but of the same ilk. Both are evergreen and are best, I think, grown up through a small tree rather than up a wall or fence, because they have a loose, lacy construction that seems to want to rest upon supporting branches rather than establish its own framework. I have C cirrhosa balearica twining up through a hawthorn, and the two seem to coexist very well, the thorn's knobbly chaos suiting the ferny fragility of the clematis. </p> <p>The inside of the petals of 'Freckles' is extravagantly splodged with burgundy, and the flowers are altogether chunkier than its forebears. In many ways it is a better plant for a trellis or around a window, as you get more flower-effect for your money. C cirrhosa 'Wisley' has undivided leaves and unfreckled flowers of pure pale cream. I have not grown it but it sounds rather good. But remember its Mediterranean origins and do not be surprised if the whole plant, name it what you will, suddenly shrivels and appears to die after a particularly bitter bout of east wind. The chances are it will recover, but tough it is not. </p> <p>You cannot say that about the winter-flowering jasmine that is now flowering in seemingly every third garden in the country. Tough and easy, any horticultural problems are only connected with restricting it. Jasminum nudiflorum is not, I admit, a climber per se, but it is almost invariably grown as a wall shrub and can be pruned and trained to behave and look like a climber. It's only real virtue is its yellowness. The flowers are spring yellow, hurray-bloody-winter-is-coming-to-an-end yellow, and for that, it is to be treasured. When the flowers have dwindled - about mid-April - it is important to cut it back hard, otherwise it sprawls and tangles without the addition of any extra flowers next year. We have friends with one on a north-facing wall of their house by some steps. The steps are not particularly wide and there is no room for an expanding jasmine, so they shear back almost to the bricks each spring. It always flowers perfectly and has done so, to my knowledge, for at least 20 years. </p> <p> J nudiflorum was introduced by Robert Fortune in 1844, after his first trip to China. He is a plant-hunter hero, one of the breed that plundered the world to make Britain what it is today. Literally. But I have just looked up the reference to Fortune and the winter-flowering jasmine in the History of British Gardening by Miles Hadfield and seen the following: 'Many of his cultivations were of plants cultivated in Chinese gardens; he got on well with the people whom, however, he rather despised as having too high an opinion of themselves and their works.' Lovely man. And, when he was not busy despising his hosts he also took part in industrial espionage, passing himself off as Chinese in order to steal tea plants so that the British could establish tea plantations in India. Heroes, eh? </p> <p>Another Chinese introduction is Clematis armandii, which was sent as seed by Ernest Wilson a century ago. I do not know how politically correct Wilson's views were, nor do I care, but his adventures collecting plants were extraordinary and make James Bond look a wimp. The fact that it was all in pursuit of flowers adds a quaintly debonair twist. C armandii will not be flowering for a little while, even in the most protected southern garden, but it is one of the very earliest of clematis and certainly one of the loveliest. The leaves are a waxy green, almost like slimline, refined laurel, but the flowers are sumptuous, managing to be small and refined and yet somehow opulent. The scent aids this impression, being a powerful fragrance touched with almonds. We had one in our London garden in the 80s, growing on a west-facing wall and it seemed to prosper, but if you have a south-facing wall it would be better still.

      "bodyText": "I wish Clematis cirrhosa balearica had a familiar name rather than a label sounding like bleary liver damage. The unpronounceable spelling mitigates against it before you begin. There is a variety called C cirrhosa 'Freckles' which is more of a nickname, along the rather strained lines of 'Tubby Dorset' or 'Bunny Norfolk', but at least there is an attempt at familiarity. 'Freckles' could be an old schoolfriend with an embarrassing tag, but C cirrhosa balearica will always be the key that locks you into a formal relationship. The real point is that the name does nothing to explain the plant in terms of emotional intelligence. And yet, at this time of year, any plant that flowers at all should be celebrated, and if it is a climber that flowers with an extraordinary fragile beauty and smells fabulous to boot, then we should all be in on the act, rubbing shoulders on careless first-name terms. While we are riding the hobbyhorse of nomenclature, let's begin at the beginning. First there was C cirrhosa, green of leaf and with charming cream-coloured bell-flowers hanging shyly half-hidden by the oval leaves, which turned a tint of bronze in autumn. It comes from Spain and Portugal and right across the Mediterranean, which tells a lot about how it wants to be grown. In this country it is happiest in a warm, sheltered spot. Then came C cirrhosa balearica, the leaves of which are finely cut to the point of filigree. More flowers, too, but of the same ilk. Both are evergreen and are best, I think, grown up through a small tree rather than up a wall or fence, because they have a loose, lacy construction that seems to want to rest upon supporting branches rather than establish its own framework. I have C cirrhosa balearica twining up through a hawthorn, and the two seem to coexist very well, the thorn's knobbly chaos suiting the ferny fragility of the clematis. The inside of the petals of 'Freckles' is extravagantly splodged with burgundy, and the flowers are altogether chunkier than its forebears. In many ways it is a better plant for a trellis or around a window, as you get more flower-effect for your money. C cirrhosa 'Wisley' has undivided leaves and unfreckled flowers of pure pale cream. I have not grown it but it sounds rather good. But remember its Mediterranean origins and do not be surprised if the whole plant, name it what you will, suddenly shrivels and appears to die after a particularly bitter bout of east wind. The chances are it will recover, but tough it is not. You cannot say that about the winter-flowering jasmine that is now flowering in seemingly every third garden in the country. Tough and easy, any horticultural problems are only connected with restricting it. Jasminum nudiflorum is not, I admit, a climber per se, but it is almost invariably grown as a wall shrub and can be pruned and trained to behave and look like a climber. It's only real virtue is its yellowness. The flowers are spring yellow, hurray-bloody-winter-is-coming-to-an-end yellow, and for that, it is to be treasured. When the flowers have dwindled - about mid-April - it is important to cut it back hard, otherwise it sprawls and tangles without the addition of any extra flowers next year. We have friends with one on a north-facing wall of their house by some steps. The steps are not particularly wide and there is no room for an expanding jasmine, so they shear back almost to the bricks each spring. It always flowers perfectly and has done so, to my knowledge, for at least 20 years. J nudiflorum was introduced by Robert Fortune in 1844, after his first trip to China. He is a plant-hunter hero, one of the breed that plundered the world to make Britain what it is today. Literally. But I have just looked up the reference to Fortune and the winter-flowering jasmine in the History of British Gardening by Miles Hadfield and seen the following: 'Many of his cultivations were of plants cultivated in Chinese gardens; he got on well with the people whom, however, he rather despised as having too high an opinion of themselves and their works.' Lovely man. And, when he was not busy despising his hosts he also took part in industrial espionage, passing himself off as Chinese in order to steal tea plants so that the British could establish tea plantations in India. Heroes, eh? Another Chinese introduction is Clematis armandii, which was sent as seed by Ernest Wilson a century ago. I do not know how politically correct Wilson's views were, nor do I care, but his adventures collecting plants were extraordinary and make James Bond look a wimp. The fact that it was all in pursuit of flowers adds a quaintly debonair twist. C armandii will not be flowering for a little while, even in the most protected southern garden, but it is one of the very earliest of clematis and certainly one of the loveliest. The leaves are a waxy green, almost like slimline, refined laurel, but the flowers are sumptuous, managing to be small and refined and yet somehow opulent. The scent aids this impression, being a powerful fragrance touched with almonds. We had one in our London garden in the 80s, growing on a west-facing wall and it seemed to prosper, but if you have a south-facing wall it would be better still. It is ideal for a trellis, and because the evergreen leaves create quite a dense foliar cover, acts as an effective screen. C armandii 'Apple Blossom' is a pinkish version, but I think inferior to the species. Keep it quite, quite white. I got into trouble a few years ago when I suggested that the fruits of ornamental quince were not worth eating. This was ignorance rather than opinion and the letters came flooding in to set me right. But no one grows them primarily for their fruit - the fruiting quince Cydonia oblonga is your best and most delicious bet for that. The rock-hard fruits are a bonus following on from the flowers that are looking so good from now and for the next month or two.

If Britain were to leave the EU, says a group of 'academics' at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the effects of 'lower demand' would feed through the system like some auto-immune deficiency, laying waste 30 per cent of Britain's 27.2 million strong workforce. They really seem to mean it, that one in three jobs would go. Two of Cherie Blair's new social secretaries would be sent weeping to the JobCentre. It would be an employment holocaust, say the 'academics', on a scale eclipsing the Depression of the Thirties 1930s, with a trudging army of jobless outnumbering all those currently working in the manufacturing, retailing and public sectors put together. </p> <p> The effect was slightly spoilt yesterday when the top man at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said the report was 'plain silly'. It turns out that there are 2.7 million jobs directly linked to trade with the EU, and a further 500,000 indirectly linked. According to Mr Martin Weale, it is 'unlikely that many of these jobs would be lost permanently even if Britain left the EU'. 'There is no reason ,' said Mr Weale, continuing to rain on Tony Blair's parade, 'why being outside the EU should necessarily involve mass unemployment.' In fact, said Mr Weale, he was so enraged at the way his boffins' findings had been distorted, so peeved with Mr Keith Vaz and his ridiculous 'Out of Europe, Out of Work' campaign, that he wasn't even going to turn up, this week, to the launch of the 'study', and its attendant poster unveiling operation. Of course, poor Mr Weale is right.</p> <p>He is being used, cheated and cozened by the government, and the increasingly desperate ginger group, Britain In Europe. It is exceedingly doubtful that a single job would be lost if Britain withdrew from the EU tomorrow, whether in the short term or the long term; even the chauffeurs of Geoffrey Martin, the EC Commission's 'Ambassador' to London, would be safe, since the Commission would still need its ambassador here, just as it has them boondoggling away in Ouagadougou, Dar-Es-Salaam, Moscow and everywhere else. When I go to Switzerland, I don't notice a third of the workforce poking each other in the eye over the last chunk of Toblerone. And yet Francis Maude, the Shadow Foreign Secretary, who has been lured into denouncing this fantasy, is unwittingly playing the Government's game. </p> <p>We are being tempted to give battle, but on the wrong battlefield. We are being cunningly asked the wrong question. There is not one major political party advocating that Britain should leave the EU. The Tories firmly want to stay in. I want to stay in. The question is nothing to do with In or Out, and all about the single currency; and as Mr Blair knows, an amazing 69 per cent of the public are now opposed to joining. It has been hilarious, over the last year and a bit, to see all the gloomsters eating humble pie. There was Lord Levene, the Lord Mayor of London, warning about the impact on the City if Britain failed to join the euro; until he was forced, late last year, to confess that he had been totally wrong, and that the fortunes of the City had leapt up like a bouncing bonus, while the euro had slipped below parity with the dollar. </p> <p>It has become increasingly obvious (perhaps even to Gordon Brown) that Britain has a glorious future: continuing to enjoy whatsoever benefits there are of EU membership, but outside the euro, with its top-down bossiness, undemocratic tax harmonisation and inappropriate interest rates. That is why Blair and Vaz and Cook and their stooges in Britain in Europe have resorted to this cretinous babble about leaving the EU, and the loss of eight million jobs. And if this is the best they can do, the pound has a long life ahead of it. </p> <p>On Wednesday Blair will go to Ghent, where he will attempt to soften public hostility to the euro by promising a parallel 'reform' of the EU's institutions. This is a laugh, since the core EU countries have no desire whatsoever to change the way Brussels works: the Commission undemocratically proposing, the Council undemocratically deciding, the Euro-parliament feebly sticking its oar in. It is now more than 10 ten years since the fall of the Berlin Wall. How long do they have to wait, those countries which suffered 40 forty years of Communist tyranny, before Brussels 'reforms' itself sufficiently to let them in? Another five years? Another 10? </p> <p> If we go on like this, Prague, Budapest and Warsaw may decide to enjoy their prosperity on their own, even if Britain in Europe tells them that a third of their workforce is at risk. But let us suppose they do join, and the French get over their phobia of Hungarian jam imports, and the Germans brace themselves for Polish gherkins; let us suppose the EU encompasses the 27 countries envisaged by Romano Prodi. Never mind the absence of logic involved in welcoming, say, Moldova and excluding Ukraine. Does anyone imagine that this vast congeries of countries will all accept monetary rule from Frankfurt or obey the acquis communautaire?</p> <p> Of course not. If reform means anything, it means a Europe in tiers, where some countries will be exempted from policies they cannot or will not accept. And that is the ideal context to campaign, as the Tories are, for Britain in Europe, but not in the euro, and an end to the pathetic attempts of Mr Vaz and Tony Blair to make our flesh creep. </p> <p>\u0095Boris Johnson is editor of the Spectator.</p>",

On Wednesday Blair will go to Ghent, where he will attempt to soften public hostility to the euro by promising a parallel 'reform' of the EU's institutions. This is a laugh, since the core EU countries have no desire whatsoever to change the way Brussels works: the Commission undemocratically proposing, the Council undemocratically deciding, the Euro-parliament feebly sticking its oar in. It is now more than 10 ten years since the fall of the Berlin Wall. How long do they have to wait, those countries which suffered 40 forty years of Communist tyranny, before Brussels 'reforms' itself sufficiently to let them in? Another five years? Another 10? If we go on like this, Prague, Budapest and Warsaw may decide to enjoy their prosperity on their own, even if Britain in Europe tells them that a third of their workforce is at risk. But let us suppose they do join, and the French get over their phobia of Hungarian jam imports, and the Germans brace themselves for Polish gherkins; let us suppose the EU encompasses the 27 countries envisaged by Romano Prodi. Never mind the absence of logic involved in welcoming, say, Moldova and excluding Ukraine. Does anyone imagine that this vast congeries of countries will all accept monetary rule from Frankfurt or obey the acquis communautaire? Of course not. If reform means anything, it means a Europe in tiers, where some countries will be exempted from policies they cannot or will not accept. And that is the ideal context to campaign, as the Tories are, for Britain in Europe, but not in the euro, and an end to the pathetic attempts of Mr Vaz and Tony Blair to make our flesh creep. \u0095Boris Johnson is editor of the Spectator.",

It is a minor milestone of the silent era but, more importantly, its director and star were the parents of Sergio Leone, who in 1964 was to honour his father and conceal his Italian identity by signing himself 'Bob Robertson' on his seminal spaghetti western, A Fistful of Dollars.</p> <p>Leone was not, however, born until 1929, long after his mother had retired from the screen and at a point when his father was ostracised by the movie industry for his anti-fascist sentiments. </p> <p>Christopher Frayling, cultural historian and Rector of the Royal College of Art, was one of the earliest apologists for the spaghetti western and his fascinating, long-awaited biography of Leone is an informative history of Italian popular cinema, a perceptive essay on changing tastes, and a minute examination of Leone's small, highly influential oeuvre. </p> <p>The strictly biographical strand is in some ways the least significant aspect. Happily married by his late twenties to a ballet dancer, who, like their three children, became involved in the family business, Leone seems to have had little life outside the cinema. We hear of his passion for art and antiques, for good food and wine (eating and drinking feature significantly in his work). But only incidentally do we learn, in connection with his funeral in 1989 at the age of 60, that he was 'a friend and golfing companion' of the Minister of Tourism and Entertainment. </p> <p>Mussolini's educational system and its propagandistic view of history produced a generation of cynics, Leone among them. As a lonely, only child, he spent much of his time in movie houses, finding in American films a social and moral security absent from the chaos of fascist Italy. </p> <p>Then real Americans turned up as liberators to challenge these verities, and they were neither the knights of comic books nor the modern embodiment of the heroes of Leone's beloved Homer. As a reluctant postwar law student, Leone hung round film studios during the golden age of neorealism, appearing as one of the seminarians sheltering from the rain alongside the sad Roman bill-poster and his son on De Sica's Bicycle Thief. But neorealism didn't attract Leone, who never made a movie set in the present. </p> <p>When Cinecitt\u00e0 became Hollywood-on-the-Tiber, Leone's dedication and competence made him a sought-after assistant to visiting Americans and he worked with Mervyn LeRoy (Quo Vadis), Robert Wise (Helen of Troy), William Wyler (Ben Hur), Fred Zinnemann (The Nun's Story) and Robert Aldrich (Sodom and Gomorrah). </p> <p>The expensive US costume pictures were accompanied by the low-budget Italian 'peplums' (the title coming from the term for the brief tunics worn by the heroes and heroines), and it was on one such local epic, The Colossus of Rhodes, that Leone got his first directorial credit and ended his apprenticeship. The fashion for peplum pictures rapidly faded in the early 1960s, producing a crisis in the Italian industry. </p> <p>Salvation came in the form of the spaghetti western, largely through the sensational success of Leone's Dollar trilogy. A Fistful of Dollars drew on Leone's childhood love of Neapolitan puppet theatre, his encylopedic knowledge of Hollywood westerns, and his deep ambivalence about American culture. He breathed new life into a dying genre and made a world star of the minor TV actor Clint Eastwood. </p> <p>Observers called his pictures cynical and brutal, as well as baroque, rococo, mannerist and postmodern. Coining verbs, his brother-in-law believed that Leone 'spectacularised', while his most famous creation, Eastwood, thought he 'operacised'. With the grandiose, pessimistic Once Upon a Time in the West, an anthology of scenes from 30-odd classical westerns, he challenged Hollywood's synoptic, mindlessly affirmative How the West Was Won. </p> <p>Having refused an invitation to direct The Godfather, he spent years setting up and producing the Proustian crime epic Once Upon a Time in America, which he conceived as a homage to the gangster movie and a demolition of its mythology. His 'fairy tales for adults' were melancholic, elegiac, obsessed with death. </p> <p>When he became a widely interviewed guru in the early 1970s, the stocky, bearded, bespectacled Leone resembled in appearance and language Italy's most renowned cultural commentator, Umberto Eco. This provoked various embittered associates to challenge his intellectual credentials. While admitting he had a great visual sense, they claimed he was a stumbling, ill-read peasant, who appropriated other people's ideas. 'Arrogant and uncultured,' according to the screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, though Henry Fonda found him 'the best director I've ever worked with in my life'. </p> <p>One clue to an understanding of Leone's career, Frayling suggests, resides in his attitude to the English language. Mussolini's regime insisted on all foreign films being dubbed into Italian, so Leone grew up with American images divorced from their soundtracks. Despite the fact that nearly every picture he assisted on and all those he directed had English-speaking actors in the central roles, he never learnt to speak English. Moreover, he disliked English and communicated with his performers through translators and by acting out the effects he required. Dislocation became a component of his art, as did his insistence that to learn about life and to make movies, you don't need to step outside a cinema. </p> <p>He also points to parallels with David Lean. Both concealed a fundamental insecurity beneath a cloak of arrogance. They emerged from years of labouring in cinematic vineyards to become obsessive perfectionists, working in Europe with American money on increasingly lengthy projects. Both made only two movies in the last 20 years of their lives and each died shortly before embarking on films they thought would be the apex of their careers - Lean's Nostromo, Leone's Leningrad.</p>",

This is not just because of the squirm-making messages from Tony Blair. </p> <p>It's also because the Downing Street chat room, as any Internet buff could have warned them, is fast becoming a rallying point for all the jokers, pranksters and paranoiacs disaffected in Blair's Britain. </p> <p>Where better, after all, for like-minded patriots, Blair haters and asylum-seeker bashers to find each other than outside the cyber portals of No10? </p> <p>Blair is given to bashful boasts that he's an Internet virgin. It shows. Perhaps his advisers should have taken the elementary precaution of visiting other chat rooms for him. Had they done so, they would have realised this is a naturally mischievous medium, not the great educator of Blair's dreams. This is where anonymous identity prevails, where subversive information flows freely, and where dissidents and rebels find each other. </p> <p>Currently a large proportion of contributors to the Government's 'suggested topics' have joke names. William Plague and Gilbert Sniggers were removed but instantly replaced by the likes of Lavinia Lovehandles, advancing views on Section 28, or Percy Partridge, suggesting that season tickets should be stamped on people's foreheads. </p> <p>There's something about the anonymity of e-communication. People often say things in much more extreme and insulting ways, what the Americans call 'flaming'. Many feel freed from normal social responsibilities; they say politically subversive things, make jokes and use sexual innuendo. The extreme jitteriness last week about various Net crashes is because governments and commerce realise they are so vulnerable to those who operate at this borderline between subversion and prank. Now children don't want to be train drivers when they grow up, but hackers. </p> <p>If Downing Street was ignorant of all this before, it will be on a sharp learning curve now. The website is currently hosting discussions between 'Blair Witch Hunt', 'Bad Man', 'Filthy Contractor Scum' and 'Soon to be Ex EU taxpayer'. </p> <p>To say these contributions are full of ideological impurities is something of an understatement. 'E-tax e-vader' suggests 'ingenious' methods of tax evasion and 'Last Contractor Out, turn out the light' speaks for many in expressing hatred of the Government for removing freelance status from IT contractors. </p> <p>For the first few days the only warning was a rather prissy reminder to participants not to swear because children might visit the website. Now this liberal, all-may-come approach has been revised. </p> <p>In a typical leap from 'open government' to Stalinism, the site now warns that 'inappropriate postings, including those containing offensive, defamatory or libellous comments, will be deleted. </p> <p>Needless to say, Net users were well ahead of the game. Anticipating the use of filters to screen out certain words and subjects, the discussion of 'S'ction 28' was already being conducted graphically, full of references to hom'sexuality, ora' and ana' s'x. </p> <p>All these warnings have done is encourage that other Internet preoccupation - paranoia. What are filters looking for? Is someone reading all this, as they claim? If so, how do they decide what is 'appropriate'? Doesn't any form of screening make a nonsense of free speech? And if someone is reading, why no official response? </p> <p>'It is entirely possible,' writes 'Merlinas', 'that this site can be used to collect data about participants on this forum.' </p> <p>Rumour has it that rather than a sophisticated monitoring operation, three operators are struggling to keep on top of this deluge. Perhaps I'm becoming paranoid myself, but I can't help wondering if one of them has entered into the spirit of things, passing themselves off as 'Sylvia', a fragrant pro-Government liberal, who takes on 'Naval Officer' and 'Disappointed Christian' over their views on homosexuality and asylum-seekers. Who would choose Sylvia as a pseudonym? Someone who admires Sylvia Pankhurst? Perhaps our very own Minister of E-things, Patricia Hewitt? </p> <p>We will soon know if Sylvia is a Government stooge. It can't be long before the other chat room preoccupation emerges - sex. If 'Sylvia' raises the topic of VAT on fuel and how to keep warm in winter, 'Naval Officer' will doubtless offer to warm her up. </p> <p>The prospect of cybersex under the nose of Government observers will surely be hard to resist for a real Internut. </p> <p>The possibilities are endless and this website may acquire cult status, joining the ranks of 'Dissecting a Dead Furby', 'The Hamster Dance' and 'Smack a Spice Girl'. American high school kids have not found it yet but it is only a matter of time. </p> <p>There is only one thing for the decent upstanding citizen to do in the circumstances. Join a free Internet provider, create yourself a silly e-mail name and do what the Internet was designed for: give a voice to the naughty child within.</p>",

Had they done so, they would have realised this is a naturally mischievous medium, not the great educator of Blair's dreams. This is where anonymous identity prevails, where subversive information flows freely, and where dissidents and rebels find each other. Currently a large proportion of contributors to the Government's 'suggested topics' have joke names. William Plague and Gilbert Sniggers were removed but instantly replaced by the likes of Lavinia Lovehandles, advancing views on Section 28, or Percy Partridge, suggesting that season tickets should be stamped on people's foreheads. There's something about the anonymity of e-communication. People often say things in much more extreme and insulting ways, what the Americans call 'flaming'. Many feel freed from normal social responsibilities; they say politically subversive things, make jokes and use sexual innuendo. The extreme jitteriness last week about various Net crashes is because governments and commerce realise they are so vulnerable to those who operate at this borderline between subversion and prank. Now children don't want to be train drivers when they grow up, but hackers. If Downing Street was ignorant of all this before, it will be on a sharp learning curve now. The website is currently hosting discussions between 'Blair Witch Hunt', 'Bad Man', 'Filthy Contractor Scum' and 'Soon to be Ex EU taxpayer'. To say these contributions are full of ideological impurities is something of an understatement. 'E-tax e-vader' suggests 'ingenious' methods of tax evasion and 'Last Contractor Out, turn out the light' speaks for many in expressing hatred of the Government for removing freelance status from IT contractors. For the first few days the only warning was a rather prissy reminder to participants not to swear because children might visit the website. Now this liberal, all-may-come approach has been revised. In a typical leap from 'open government' to Stalinism, the site now warns that 'inappropriate postings, including those containing offensive, defamatory or libellous comments, will be deleted. Needless to say, Net users were well ahead of the game. Anticipating the use of filters to screen out certain words and subjects, the discussion of 'S'ction 28' was already being conducted graphically, full of references to hom'sexuality, ora' and ana' s'x. All these warnings have done is encourage that other Internet preoccupation - paranoia. What are filters looking for? Is someone reading all this, as they claim? If so, how do they decide what is 'appropriate'? Doesn't any form of screening make a nonsense of free speech? And if someone is reading, why no official response? 'It is entirely possible,' writes 'Merlinas', 'that this site can be used to collect data about participants on this forum.' Rumour has it that rather than a sophisticated monitoring operation, three operators are struggling to keep on top of this deluge. Perhaps I'm becoming paranoid myself, but I can't help wondering if one of them has entered into the spirit of things, passing themselves off as 'Sylvia', a fragrant pro-Government liberal, who takes on 'Naval Officer' and 'Disappointed Christian' over their views on homosexuality and asylum-seekers. Who would choose Sylvia as a pseudonym? Someone who admires Sylvia Pankhurst? Perhaps our very own Minister of E-things, Patricia Hewitt? We will soon know if Sylvia is a Government stooge. It can't be long before the other chat room preoccupation emerges - sex. If 'Sylvia' raises the topic of VAT on fuel and how to keep warm in winter, 'Naval Officer' will doubtless offer to warm her up. The prospect of cybersex under the nose of Government observers will surely be hard to resist for a real Internut. The possibilities are endless and this website may acquire cult status, joining the ranks of 'Dissecting a Dead Furby', 'The Hamster Dance' and 'Smack a Spice Girl'. American high school kids have not found it yet but it is only a matter of time. There is only one thing for the decent upstanding citizen to do in the circumstances. Join a free Internet provider, create yourself a silly e-mail name and do what the Internet was designed for: give a voice to the naughty child within.",

      "body": "<p>Naomi Gryn grew up with her father's stories of his childhood in Carpathia - 'a faraway, fairy tale land beneath the mountains, where children drank wine instead of water, and uncles played violin with the Gypsies under a moon that was always full'.</p> <p>It is this childhood that is the subject of the first third of Rabbi Hugo Gryn's posthumous memoir, lovingly edited by his daughter and published now, four years after his death. He remembers vineyards, bookstores, family meals and Jewish festivals, plaited loaves of bread, pickled herrings, nights full of stars, the saintly great-grandmother Esther, the grandfather with the pipe, the uncle with the glass eye, the beloved cousins... A mythological time, belonging to a vanished world; a golden time extinguished by the pitch dark of the Holocaust. </p> <p>Naomi Gryn (a film-maker) says that she thinks of those early years of her father's life as 'animation, colourful and bright, like a Walt Disney film'. What comes next, the stories he did not tell, 'is monochrome, all black and white, then a series of grotesque stills'. </p> <p>Hugo Gryn - rabbi for 32 years at the West London synagogue, tireless campaigner for tolerance, well known broadcaster and contributor to The Moral Maze - was 13 when he and his family (father, mother, younger brother Gabi) were taken from their home in the market-town of Berehova, forced into a ghetto, and from there transported to Auschwitz. Here, the family were separated: Hugo - giving his age as 19 and his occupation as carpenter - was grouped with his father and other adults; his little brother didn't stand a chance. He was killed soon after. Hugo, with his father as protector and guide, survived the labour camps and two death marches. He was given, as Naomi says, 52 years of unexpected life. </p> <p>For years, many people had no idea that Rabbi Hugo Gryn was a Holocaust survivor. He did not talk much about the year that tore his life in half to his family. 'Oh, we all knew of course, and he would answer questions if we asked. Only when we were around 13 - the age he was when he was taken to Auschwitz - did he tell us something of what had happened. Even then, I think there was some denial, perfectly healthy and understandable denial, going on with my father. He didn't want to look back. He lived very much in the present; he was always so busy, he filled up his life. Maybe that was how people survived.'</p> <p>She says that when he was a student and suicidal he was told to 'pull himself together'. And that when, studying to become a rabbi, psychoanalysis was part of his training, his experiences during the war were never discussed. </p> <p>Chasing Shadows is in many ways a memoir from which memory is expunged, a story about horror and loss which yet manages to hold horror and loss at arm's length. The chapters about Gryn's experiences in Auschwitz and the labour camps, which he wrote in 1951 when he was in his early twenties, are written partly in the present tense, in the imagined voice of the teenager he had been, and have an oddly sprightly and disconcerting tone. (For instance, Hugo invents for himself another brother to lose and yet barely mentions his mother and Gabi, who become forgotten ghosts.) It is as if Hugo Gryn - rushing through the terrible narrative - is both showing and not showing, telling and not telling, remembering and trying to forget. It is a book of revelation and denial. Naomi Gryn calls it 'cold testimony'. </p> <p>But in an inversion of the usual rule, that the pain of the past recedes into more abstract history, it seems as if Hugo Gryn came closer to what had happened to him as he grew older. In 1978, shocked out of silence by the Holocaust-denial literature, he spoke publicly for the first time about his own experiences of the Holocaust ('I am conscious of a witness complex in myself... and I have a growing urge to speak for and on behalf of those who no longer can'). His words at last are impassioned, resonant, profound. </p> <p>There was a day in the camp, when all the prisoners were given an unexpected opportunity to write one postcard. Like hundreds of the others, he left the card blank; he had no one to write to, and he understood then that there was nobody left for him, in the whole world. He began again. He became a rabbi, a broadcaster, a family man. He married the woman he met as a teenager, in the Jewish youth movement, and they quickly had four children: Gabi (for his younger brother), Naomi, Rachelle, David. It was a boisterous, noisy, loving household, full of visitors, lots of squabbling and shouting and fun. </p> <p>'My father was always very busy', says Naomi, smiling. 'Right up to the end. Even when he was dying he insisted on going on The Moral Maze. The week before, when he had diabetes, brain tumours, pneumonia, you name it, he got out of his hospital bed and went to Wales, to the school where he was a governor.'</p> <p>But if he was busy, he was also adoring. 'It was as if we had two Jewish mothers,' says Naomi. 'He was anxious, protective - although I'd always want him to come with me to hospital appointments or whatever, because he could make a rainy day sunny. Maybe that was one of the things about being a survivor - he had this great zest for life.' He also became addicted to Mogadon, which he took because of his recurring nightmares. </p> <p>Friday night was sacred. 'Every Friday, no competition, I was with them; if I was out of London I'd have to get to a phone. Even if I was in the middle of a desert I'd have to get to a phone. I'm still trying to work out how to get through Fridays without him.' She calls him Super Dad - and, more ruefully, 'my father the saint'. </p> <p>Growing up with a saint - a man who has been through hell and come out the other side full of goodness, with the gift for happiness - had its burdens. 'I never saw him as a victim, because he never saw himself as a victim: he would always insist on that; the ones who died were the victims. I just saw him heroically. Can you imagine, having a father who had been in a concentration camp and survived it; who dressed up in these magnificent robes and strode out to a swelling orchestra and full choir to tell people how to lead better lives. Oh, he was extraordinary to us.' </p> <p>She says that the child of a survivor can help the parent 'edit their memories; help them to be a witness'. She also says that what her father went through has taught her that 'you never know who is going to be the perpetrator, the victim, the bystander. You just have to check yourself the whole time. You have to check you are clean. You have to live your life truthfully, with integrity and hope you don't get swallowed up.' When I suggest that there could have been a difficulty in having a father like Hugo Gryn, whose experience must always overshadow hers, she laughs; 'Give me a life where nothing happens.' </p> <p>Yet she admits that she has always had a tendency - particularly in the past decade when she was listening to her father's memories, watching him die of prostate cancer, and (after a serious car crash) suffering from post-traumatic stress herself - to be 'Holocausty'. She says the ugly word with a dramatic gesture, self-mocking and yet serious. When she was at her lowest - 'a walking shuffler, uncontrolled,self-obsessed, very black' - she remembers standing in front of the mirror in her bathroom, brushing her teeth. 'And yes, there was Holocaust in it. I stared at my face and I thought: there is no sanity in the world after Auschwitz. It was very scary.' </p> <p>Naomi repeatedly draws parallels between her father's experiences and her own, and it is as if she is trying to recreate some of his experiences, and even in some uncanny way to become him (when he was dying in hospital, she would pass out when he was given anaesthetics; 'we were one'). She talks of herself, again and again, as his 'witness', 'his debriefer', 'made of the same stuff'. </p> <p>In the years since his death, he has moved from being 'out there' and lost to her, to 'in here' (she presses her heart, her head). She has become the joint author of his life; the custodian of his memory. There is always something curious about a living person taking over the life of a dead person. Collaboration is also competition. And in this case, Naomi Gryn has in some sense inherited Hugo Gryn's holocaust. This is a strange, unnerving inheritance to want to choose. </p> <p>Hugo Gryn did not want to die. For a long time he did not tell anyone outside the family that he was dying. Naomi managed to persuade herself that the shadows on the X-ray were TB, not cancer. Right up to the end, the family were planning his future. </p> <p>'He used to say that very often people turned their faced to the wall before they died, and he didn't want to do that. He wanted to be alive right up to the end. We were all with him. And afterwards I spent months just longing to be dead - not suicidal, just longing to be dead. I had this dream that my father was in a boat, sailing down the Ganges, and there were all these people standing round him and he was telling stories and laughing. He was sailing off, and he didn't even see me waving goodbye.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>How can you be a writer and live in Hawaii? Hawaii is the most bookless place I have ever been to in my life - you can't even buy a guidebook to Hawaii there. You see things that look like guidebooks in the hotel shops, but they turn out to be videos. Practically the only newspaper is the piss-poor Honolulu Advertiser, and you're lucky if you can get a two-day old copy of USA Today. </p> <p>Hawaii makes Los Angeles look like Florence under the Medicis. I didn't even know Paul Theroux lived in Hawaii when I asked to interview him - I thought he lived in Cape Cod. Unfortunately, he only goes there in the summer. Worse still, he lives 40 miles from Honolulu, way out on the north shore, and says he very rarely goes in to 'town'. So, when I finally met him in Haleiwi, his nearest village, I felt like Stanley tracking down Dr Livingstone. Anyway, he was very friendly and made a sweet speech, saying, 'I'm very grateful to you for coming here. I would much prefer to be doing what we're doing now than meeting in a hotel in London, and it's a truer picture of my life.' </p> <p>Well, fine, or fine-ish. Except that I quickly began to wonder if this pleasant stranger was Paul Theroux. For a start, he didn't look remotely like the Paul Theroux I met 15 years ago at a dinner party in London. That Theroux was urbane and elegant - this one is wearing shorts and has a string of dolphins tattooed around his ankle. Oh, please! You cannot be a serious writer and have dolphins tattooed around your ankle - I am sorry, it would take too long to explain, but you just can't. I had been reading Theroux for weeks before I went to Hawaii and had entered into (I thought) his mind and now here was this ludicrously laid-back impostor maundering on about Hawaiian culture (huh?) in the sort of wafty sing-song voice that betokens recent wheatgrass drinking. </p> <p>He said he'd show me the north shore before we went to his house, and took me on a long drive round the surfing beaches, discoursing all the while about native birds and plants, house prices (he knows all the house prices) and surf breaks and Hawaiian history. Of course it was interesting, but I began to panic: is this all he would talk about? Any time I asked a personal question, he would spot a fascinating tree or plant he had to tell me about. It was only when he pointed to a little beach and said, 'I come down here in the afternoons to read Muriel Spark' that he gave any evidence of being a writer at all. </p> <p>What a weird trajectory his life has been - from the top northeastern corner of the USA to the bottom southwestern corner via Africa, Singapore and 18 years in England. He grew up in a dull Massachusetts suburb, the third of seven children of a Catholic shoe salesman, and joined the Peace Corps to avoid the Vietnam draft. The corps sent him to teach in Africa, where he met and married an Englishwoman, Anne. They lived in Singapore for a few years, then moved to London, where they brought up their two sons, Marcel and Louis (Louis makes the enjoyable BBC TV series Weird Weekends, Marcel makes programmes about Russia and writes novels). For l8 years, Theroux was a familiar figure on the London literary scene, and then suddenly he disappeared. </p> <p>Apparently his marriage, which had been bad for some time, collapsed in January 1990, and he left his wife and left London the same day. He felt he couldn't stay around: 'People do bump into each other in London.' In My Other Life (1996), he describes a period of living alone in Cape Cod after his marriage ended, going quietly mad, and going to a shrink. But when I refer to it, he says, 'Oh no, now you're mistaking a novel with the facts. I left London, went skiing and then came here.' </p> <p>He had already met Sheila, his present wife, who is Chinese-Hawaiian: they married five years ago. She is very pretty, and looks about 40, though I have worked out she must be in her fifties, because she was a classmate of Bette Midler's. She runs her own PR company in Honolulu - a long commute from the north shore, where they live - specialising mainly in travel and hotel accounts. (She is sometimes misleadingly described as Robert Redford's PR, because she once held the Sundance resort account.) Anyway, she is very nice and when I asked what attracted her to Theroux she said, 'He's my hero - the sweetest, smartest hero on earth' without actually making me throw up. </p> <p>When Theroux lived in London, he dreamed of buying a house near Bamber Gascoigne's on Richmond Hill - 'That was one of my last yearnings' - but now he lives in a Hawaiian pole house (on stilts) with lots of land for his beehives. The house is decorated with English paintings (a Bratby, a Stanley Spencer, some Edward Lear watercolours) and Polynesian artefacts. Down the hill, there is a brand-new house, identical in size and shape, which Theroux has just had built as his 'study'. It has its own kitchen, library and workroom, guest bedroom and gallery. Given that he and Sheila very rarely have guests, it is hard to see what they will do rattling round in their separate identical houses, but this is obviously part of his thirst for privacy - he says he can't even read, let alone write, if there is another person in the room. </p> <p>He keeps talking about how other writers must envy him, living in Hawaii. 'I mean when you describe it, people are going to go nuts and say, \"Oh, he's the shit in the shuttered chateau.\"' (This is a quote from Philip Larkin - \"The shit in the shuttered chateau/ Who does his five hundred words/Then parts out the rest of the day/Between bathing and booze and birds.\") But I dunno. Would Martin Amis want to live in Hawaii? Would Salman Rushdie? Doesn't writing have something to do with the presence of books ? </p> <p>When Theroux wants to look something up, he has to drive 40 miles to the University of Hawaii library in Honolulu. Reading is so unknown in Hawaii that he doesn't even tell people he's a writer - he says he's a beekeeper, which he is. He used to know one other writer in Hawaii - Leon Edel, the biographer of Henry James, but he died a couple of years ago, and now there are none. (Michael Crichton is rumoured to live on one of the outer islands, but Theroux hasn't met him.) He does have one writer friend, Jonathan Raban, but he lives in Seattle. To me, this all sounded tragic, but Theroux said it suited him fine. He likes to write in the mornings and go sea-kayaking or bike-riding in the afternoons. He pointed to an enormous mountain range and said he bikes up there with his best friend, a postman. </p> <p>Doesn't he miss meeting other writers? 'When I was younger, I yearned for it. When I was in Africa and then in Singapore, I dreamed of being in a room with people saying, \"Oh you're Paul Theroux! I read your last book - it was marvellous!\" And meeting Alan Sillitoe or Kingsley Amis or Angus Wilson. Then I had it! And it was great, great. But I think in the later years of living in London, I had probably had enough of it. It's nice to have it when you want it, but if I wanted it now, I would go out of my mind.' </p> <p>Yet Theroux is one of the most prolific writers of our age - 36 books in 33 years - and I would say one of the best. Inevitably, the standard is uneven, but if you edit it down to just the good stuff - The Family Arsenal, The Mosquito Coast, My Secret History, My Other Life and Sir Vidia's Shadow - then it is very good indeed, Unfortunately, his new book, Fresh-Air Fiend, is not in this league - it's a very mixed collection of his last 15 years' travel journalism, which should have been heavily pruned. If you haven't read Theroux's travel writing then don't start here, but with his first travel book, The Great Railway Bazaar - the book that launched a whole generation of imitators. It is as fresh today as on its first publication 25 years ago. </p> <p>Theroux has been a compulsive traveller all his life. As a boy, he'd go on long camping trips in the woods to get away from his family; as a young father in London, he'd take the train up to Inverness with his bike in the guard's van and cycle back down to England. I thought now he's 58 (and suffering from gout), the travel bug might have left him, but he said no, on the contrary, he was off next week to Christmas Island - a bird sanctuary that gets just one plane a week - taking a tent, a collapsible kayak and a week's worth of noodles and beans. </p> <p>He wasn't planning to write about it: it was just a holiday, a reward for finishing the first draft of his next book, The Hotel Honolulu. This has always been the pattern of his life - intense periods of writing followed by intense periods of travel. 'I can't imagine finding a place that was so nice, or having a state of mind that was so reassuring, that I would have no desire to go anywhere. I would travel even if I weren't writing, that's for sure.' </p> <p>We talked about his travel writing for a while, but it was only when I mentioned his last book, Sir Vidia's Shadow, that he suddenly dropped his lala dolphin manner and started talking like a real writer. 'Have you read it? Oh, I'm pleased.' My God, have I read it? I seem to have discussed nothing else for the past year. I've never known a book to divide people so strongly, between the Naipaul-is-a-shit and the Theroux-is-a-shit camps. The American critics uniformly took the latter view and Theroux's name in the States is now mud. Theroux believes there was an orchestrated campaign against him, but that's probably his paranoia. Naipaul stoutly maintains he has never read the book. Anyway, it's a wonderful book, a modern true version of the sorcerer's apprentice, about how Theroux as a young man met and idolised the writer VS Naipaul, learned his work practically by heart, sat at his feet, became the Boswell to his Johnson. Naipaul, in turn, praised his writing, invited him to stay in England and helped him find a publisher. </p> <p>But eventually Theroux became a famous writer himself, and the apprentice's role began to chafe. He started noticing faults in Naipaul's writing - sexism, racism (faults he is not exactly free from himself); perhaps he felt that being known as Naipaul's disciple was damaging his own reputation. The crunch came when Naipaul's wife died and Naipaul, instead of marrying his long-standing mistress Margaret, ditched her for an unknown Pakistani journalist. Theroux clearly felt as jilted as Margaret, especially when the new Lady Naipaul sent him a curt fax telling him to stay away from her husband. Theroux wrote to Naipaul begging for an explanation but none came. And then he ran into Naipaul in the street, and Naipaul 'scuttled' away from him. It was the end of the affair. </p> <p>Theroux felt he had to write the book, perhaps for his own sanity. 'If I hadn't written this book, I would be sitting here saying, \"Let me tell you about Naipaul - do you realise what he did?\" And your eyes would be glazing, and you'd be saying, \"Well, why don't you write about it?\" and I'd be saying, \"Well yeah, I'd like to but he's still alive.\"' But on that fateful day - 30 April 1996 - when Naipaul cut him in the street, he felt free to go. He was in the middle of a novel about Hawaii - the novel he is still writing now - but 'suddenly all my work in progress was in suspension. I remember seriously cudgelling my brains, thinking: how can I deal with this Naipaul issue? But really, from the moment I met him, my mind was made up.' </p> <p>Had he actually loved Naipaul? 'Oh no, people have gone down that road. No - he's very unlovable, he really is. You come across people like him - megalomaniac, self-important, insecure. And actually, I was always very anxious when I was with him, and that was very valuable, because my nervousness made me remember things. When you love someone and you're very happy, you're kind of dreamy, you don't remember. But I was always wired when I was with him.' </p> <p>Theroux says his Naipaul obsession is now over, exorcised by the book, but I'm not convinced. When I vaguely said I must interview Naipaul one day, Theroux said, 'Well, he's in New York on the 22nd, giving a reading at the YMCA, you could see him then.' Fancy him knowing Naipaul's schedule, from half a world away! Every time I tried to change the subject, it somehow zapped back to Naipaul. But when I said at the end, 'You're still obsessed,' Theroux objected violently: 'No! You asked me about him. As I said, if I hadn't written the book, I would still be obsessing. Now I feel very detached.' </p> <p>Having written on Naipaul, and now almost finished his Hawaiian novel, he is looking for his next subject, but with some despair. 'I'm really looking for stuff that I might have left out, that I can write another book about - I'm really scraping the bottom of the barrel.' I said, well, obviously, his childhood - I'm amazed that he's never written about it, except in one short story, Altar Boy. He talks in Sir Vidia's Shadow about being one of seven children, 'struggling like crabs in a basket'. Surely there's a book in that? But he says he doesn't see it. 'It wasn't a bad childhood, it was actually quite a nice childhood, but I felt that my life actually began when I left home. That's why A House for Mr Biswas [Naipaul again] is a book I couldn't write, because it's family life, it's as much family life as you'll ever get in a novel.' </p> <p>Well, why not? Perhaps because they might answer back - they're not conveniently buried in Trinidad like Naipaul's family. Theroux's brother, Alexander, has already castigated him publicly for what he saw as distortions in My Other Life. But when I mentioned Alexander, Theroux started bristling with paranoia - 'What do you mean? Did you download something from the internet?' No, actually, it's in the cuttings library - Alexander Theroux's review of My Other Life for Boston Magazine in October 1996 - in which he lambasted his younger brother as a snob and 'all-time know-it-all', 'a grumpy and oddly fussy traveller', and concluded loftily: 'We in the family don't mind his affected gentility, his smug and self-important airs, his urgent star-fucking insistence that he's a friend of lords and ladies, and only laugh at the fame he courts.' Theroux was not happy to be reminded of this, and detoured into a long disquisition on literary sibling rivalry, ranging from Thomas and Heinrich Mann to Lawrence and Gerald Durrell, before finally getting back to Alexander. 'What happened was my brother, for reasons of his own, reviewed My Other Life, and then he said all this other stuff. I think he's hurt himself badly. I don't come off badly. When you read things like: \"He's obsessed with his bowels\" - I laughed, actually. He also said that I was obsessed with my height and I was enquiring about getting lifts for my shoes! He's a funny guy. We were very close at one time; now we're not at all. He leads his own life.' </p> <p>I wonder - is this brother the clue to Sir Vidia's Shadow? He is two years older than Paul (Alexander is the second son, Paul the third), so in theory, Paul would have looked up to him as a boy. And he is a writer - according to Paul: 'There are many people who think he's a marvellous writer, who say I'm a hack and Alexander's a true artist.' I rang Alexander Theroux in Cape Cod and he sounded eerily like his brother, but as soon as I said I was writing about Paul, he referred me to his agent and rang off. Paul hasn't seen him for at least 10 years, and when he tries to ask his mother about him, she says, 'I'm getting upset.' But I wonder - it's a big, wild wonder - if Paul's relationship with Alexander was a sort of forerunner of his relationship with Naipaul: boyish adoration and emulation, followed by disillusionment, rivalry and eventual falling out. Was that why he fell so hard for Naipaul - because he had, as it were, been pre-programmed for discipleship? </p> <p>As I say, it's a wild guess, and one thing's for sure: Paul Theroux won't help me to explicate it. The Paul Theroux of his books is a carefully crafted literary artefact in no way to be confused with, or buggered up by, the far more secretive character who is the real Paul Theroux. As he writes in the intro to My Other Life (his most autobiographical book): 'It is the writer's privilege to keep some facades intact and use his own face in the masquerade.' He is very keen on the idea that other people can't 'see through' him - he boasted that when Anthony Clare interviewed him in 1997: 'He asked me a lot about the family - he was looking for something, but he didn't find what he was looking for, that was pretty clear.' </p> <p>There is a tantalising story in My Other Life in which the character called Paul Theroux goes to a psychoanalyst, and she makes some headway but eventually gives up because he refuses to play ball. Of course, he insists that this story is fiction, but when I asked if he had ever been to a real psychoanalyst he said, 'Yes. It was a very unsatisfying experience. It requires such commitment. The idea of going once or twice a week, for years - I just haven't got it in me.' Why did he start, then? 'Out of curiosity. And thinking maybe they know certain things. Well, sometimes they're on to something - but sometimes they're barking up the wrong tree.' </p> <p>One person who might explicate the real Paul Theroux is his ex-wife, Anne. She has long been rumoured to be writing a book: in fact, their son Marcel revealed in this paper a few months ago that she had written it, and sent it to Theroux. Theroux, however, tried to maintain to me that she had not written it, but that 'I would encourage her to write it. Because I'm sure that anyone who writes a book would have a greater respect for the work involved. Then they find out what it's like. It ain't easy. Anyway, I hope my wife finishes her book. I don't know what it will be like, but she's an intelligent, truthful person and she'll remember things that I've forgotten. What will she say? I don't know. I'm sure she'll say I was a good father - she can write about it, it'll be fun. I don't see that if she wrote a book, it's going to be an attack on me. I don't think it'll be: \"I discovered his lies.\" So it doesn't worry me. I'm sure she'd show it to me, but it doesn't really matter - I'm happy to just buy it off the bookstalls.' </p> <p>Uh huh. I wish Anne Theroux would publish a book, just to provoke an answering book from him - he is a writer who writes best from bile, with the juice of paranoia flowing. He is not Mr Sweetness and Light - as he says himself: 'It's quite hard to find a great writer, or even a very good writer, who is not a dysfunctional individual. It's rare to be a sweet person and a wonderful writer, though Angus Wilson was one. But writing is a process of discovering what your dysfunctions are and harnessing some kind of creative energy to all that yearning and desire and fantasising. That's what I feel writing gives to me, entering into that search.' </p> <p>So, what are his dysfunctions? Arrogance, obviously: that is why he can live so happily without a peer group - he doesn't ever see other people as his peers. Except his sons - he said they came to stay at Christmas and they were all playing Scrabble and he thought, 'How wonderful to be in a room with intelligent people all making jokes.' </p> <p>But that was a rare event for him. I get the feeling that he mentally shuts out other people, almost like an autistic. Of course he isn't autistic, but he is somehow self-enclosed. He lacks empathy, he doesn't seem to 'read' other people very well; if the people he encounters in his travels seem to behave rather weirdly, it could be because Theroux has behaved weirdly to them. You feel he has observed the human race intensely but at a distance, through literature, or through train windows, but at heart he is a Martian. That is why he might as well live in Hawaii - wherever he lived, he would never fit in. </p> <p>He says he can't imagine moving from Hawaii, though if he did move, it would be to one of the outer islands, or an even more remote Pacific chain. He talks a lot about Robert Louis Stevenson ending his days on Samoa. But doesn't a writer need some contact with the world? </p> <p>'No, that's definitely not true. I'm very interested in writers who disappeared - B Traven, who wrote The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, lived as a total recluse in Mexico. I more easily understand the writer who cuts himself off from society than I do the one writing in a French caf\u00e9 and hobnobbing. I saw Norman Mailer last summer and he told me he's moved out to Provincetown permanently, and he's getting a lot more work done. And that's a guy in his mid-seventies. I hope I'll be like him at that age.' </p> <p>I hope so, too. Sir Vidia's Shadow showed that there's still plenty of juice in Theroux: he just needs a good, annoying subject. </p> <p>\u0095 Paul Theroux's Fresh-Air Fiend (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a320) is published on 24 February</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/reviews/travel/0,6121,138190,00.html\">Giles Foden reviews Fresh-Air Fiend</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "How can you be a writer and live in Hawaii? Hawaii is the most bookless place I have ever been to in my life - you can't even buy a guidebook to Hawaii there. You see things that look like guidebooks in the hotel shops, but they turn out to be videos. Practically the only newspaper is the piss-poor Honolulu Advertiser, and you're lucky if you can get a two-day old copy of USA Today. Hawaii makes Los Angeles look like Florence under the Medicis. I didn't even know Paul Theroux lived in Hawaii when I asked to interview him - I thought he lived in Cape Cod. Unfortunately, he only goes there in the summer. Worse still, he lives 40 miles from Honolulu, way out on the north shore, and says he very rarely goes in to 'town'. So, when I finally met him in Haleiwi, his nearest village, I felt like Stanley tracking down Dr Livingstone. Anyway, he was very friendly and made a sweet speech, saying, 'I'm very grateful to you for coming here. I would much prefer to be doing what we're doing now than meeting in a hotel in London, and it's a truer picture of my life.' Well, fine, or fine-ish. Except that I quickly began to wonder if this pleasant stranger was Paul Theroux. For a start, he didn't look remotely like the Paul Theroux I met 15 years ago at a dinner party in London. That Theroux was urbane and elegant - this one is wearing shorts and has a string of dolphins tattooed around his ankle. Oh, please! You cannot be a serious writer and have dolphins tattooed around your ankle - I am sorry, it would take too long to explain, but you just can't. I had been reading Theroux for weeks before I went to Hawaii and had entered into (I thought) his mind and now here was this ludicrously laid-back impostor maundering on about Hawaiian culture (huh?) in the sort of wafty sing-song voice that betokens recent wheatgrass drinking. He said he'd show me the north shore before we went to his house, and took me on a long drive round the surfing beaches, discoursing all the while about native birds and plants, house prices (he knows all the house prices) and surf breaks and Hawaiian history. Of course it was interesting, but I began to panic: is this all he would talk about? Any time I asked a personal question, he would spot a fascinating tree or plant he had to tell me about. It was only when he pointed to a little beach and said, 'I come down here in the afternoons to read Muriel Spark' that he gave any evidence of being a writer at all. What a weird trajectory his life has been - from the top northeastern corner of the USA to the bottom southwestern corner via Africa, Singapore and 18 years in England. He grew up in a dull Massachusetts suburb, the third of seven children of a Catholic shoe salesman, and joined the Peace Corps to avoid the Vietnam draft. The corps sent him to teach in Africa, where he met and married an Englishwoman, Anne. They lived in Singapore for a few years, then moved to London, where they brought up their two sons, Marcel and Louis (Louis makes the enjoyable BBC TV series Weird Weekends, Marcel makes programmes about Russia and writes novels). For l8 years, Theroux was a familiar figure on the London literary scene, and then suddenly he disappeared. Apparently his marriage, which had been bad for some time, collapsed in January 1990, and he left his wife and left London the same day. He felt he couldn't stay around: 'People do bump into each other in London.' In My Other Life (1996), he describes a period of living alone in Cape Cod after his marriage ended, going quietly mad, and going to a shrink. But when I refer to it, he says, 'Oh no, now you're mistaking a novel with the facts. I left London, went skiing and then came here.' He had already met Sheila, his present wife, who is Chinese-Hawaiian: they married five years ago. She is very pretty, and looks about 40, though I have worked out she must be in her fifties, because she was a classmate of Bette Midler's. She runs her own PR company in Honolulu - a long commute from the north shore, where they live - specialising mainly in travel and hotel accounts. (She is sometimes misleadingly described as Robert Redford's PR, because she once held the Sundance resort account.) Anyway, she is very nice and when I asked what attracted her to Theroux she said, 'He's my hero - the sweetest, smartest hero on earth' without actually making me throw up. When Theroux lived in London, he dreamed of buying a house near Bamber Gascoigne's on Richmond Hill - 'That was one of my last yearnings' - but now he lives in a Hawaiian pole house (on stilts) with lots of land for his beehives. The house is decorated with English paintings (a Bratby, a Stanley Spencer, some Edward Lear watercolours) and Polynesian artefacts. Down the hill, there is a brand-new house, identical in size and shape, which Theroux has just had built as his 'study'. It has its own kitchen, library and workroom, guest bedroom and gallery. Given that he and Sheila very rarely have guests, it is hard to see what they will do rattling round in their separate identical houses, but this is obviously part of his thirst for privacy - he says he can't even read, let alone write, if there is another person in the room. He keeps talking about how other writers must envy him, living in Hawaii. 'I mean when you describe it, people are going to go nuts and say, \"Oh, he's the shit in the shuttered chateau.\"' (This is a quote from Philip Larkin - \"The shit in the shuttered chateau/ Who does his five hundred words/Then parts out the rest of the day/Between bathing and booze and birds.\") But I dunno. Would Martin Amis want to live in Hawaii? Would Salman Rushdie? Doesn't writing have something to do with the presence of books ? When Theroux wants to look something up, he has to drive 40 miles to the University of Hawaii library in Honolulu. Reading is so unknown in Hawaii that he doesn't even tell people he's a writer - he says he's a beekeeper, which he is. He used to know one other writer in Hawaii - Leon Edel, the biographer of Henry James, but he died a couple of years ago, and now there are none. (Michael Crichton is rumoured to live on one of the outer islands, but Theroux hasn't met him.) He does have one writer friend, Jonathan Raban, but he lives in Seattle. To me, this all sounded tragic, but Theroux said it suited him fine. He likes to write in the mornings and go sea-kayaking or bike-riding in the afternoons. He pointed to an enormous mountain range and said he bikes up there with his best friend, a postman. Doesn't he miss meeting other writers? 'When I was younger, I yearned for it. When I was in Africa and then in Singapore, I dreamed of being in a room with people saying, \"Oh you're Paul Theroux! I read your last book - it was marvellous!\" And meeting Alan Sillitoe or Kingsley Amis or Angus Wilson. Then I had it! And it was great, great. But I think in the later years of living in London, I had probably had enough of it. It's nice to have it when you want it, but if I wanted it now, I would go out of my mind.' Yet Theroux is one of the most prolific writers of our age - 36 books in 33 years - and I would say one of the best. Inevitably, the standard is uneven, but if you edit it down to just the good stuff - The Family Arsenal, The Mosquito Coast, My Secret History, My Other Life and Sir Vidia's Shadow - then it is very good indeed, Unfortunately, his new book, Fresh-Air Fiend, is not in this league - it's a very mixed collection of his last 15 years' travel journalism, which should have been heavily pruned. If you haven't read Theroux's travel writing then don't start here, but with his first travel book, The Great Railway Bazaar - the book that launched a whole generation of imitators. It is as fresh today as on its first publication 25 years ago. Theroux has been a compulsive traveller all his life. As a boy, he'd go on long camping trips in the woods to get away from his family; as a young father in London, he'd take the train up to Inverness with his bike in the guard's van and cycle back down to England. I thought now he's 58 (and suffering from gout), the travel bug might have left him, but he said no, on the contrary, he was off next week to Christmas Island - a bird sanctuary that gets just one plane a week - taking a tent, a collapsible kayak and a week's worth of noodles and beans. He wasn't planning to write about it: it was just a holiday, a reward for finishing the first draft of his next book, The Hotel Honolulu. This has always been the pattern of his life - intense periods of writing followed by intense periods of travel. 'I can't imagine finding a place that was so nice, or having a state of mind that was so reassuring, that I would have no desire to go anywhere.

'Have you read it? Oh, I'm pleased.' My God, have I read it? I seem to have discussed nothing else for the past year.

The American critics uniformly took the latter view and Theroux's name in the States is now mud. Theroux believes there was an orchestrated campaign against him, but that's probably his paranoia. Naipaul stoutly maintains he has never read the book. Anyway, it's a wonderful book, a modern true version of the sorcerer's apprentice, about how Theroux as a young man met and idolised the writer VS Naipaul, learned his work practically by heart, sat at his feet, became the Boswell to his Johnson.

The Paul Theroux of his books is a carefully crafted literary artefact in no way to be confused with, or buggered up by, the far more secretive character who is the real Paul Theroux. As he writes in the intro to My Other Life (his most autobiographical book): 'It is the writer's privilege to keep some facades intact and use his own face in the masquerade.' He is very keen on the idea that other people can't 'see through' him - he boasted that when Anthony Clare interviewed him in 1997: 'He asked me a lot about the family - he was looking for something, but he didn't find what he was looking for, that was pretty clear.' There is a tantalising story in My Other Life in which the character called Paul Theroux goes to a psychoanalyst, and she makes some headway but eventually gives up because he refuses to play ball. Of course, he insists that this story is fiction, but when I asked if he had ever been to a real psychoanalyst he said, 'Yes. It was a very unsatisfying experience. It requires such commitment. The idea of going once or twice a week, for years - I just haven't got it in me.' Why did he start, then? 'Out of curiosity. And thinking maybe they know certain things. Well, sometimes they're on to something - but sometimes they're barking up the wrong tree.' One person who might explicate the real Paul Theroux is his ex-wife, Anne. She has long been rumoured to be writing a book: in fact, their son Marcel revealed in this paper a few months ago that she had written it, and sent it to Theroux. Theroux, however, tried to maintain to me that she had not written it, but that 'I would encourage her to write it. Because I'm sure that anyone who writes a book would have a greater respect for the work involved. Then they find out what it's like. It ain't easy. Anyway, I hope my wife finishes her book. I don't know what it will be like, but she's an intelligent, truthful person and she'll remember things that I've forgotten. What will she say? I don't know. I'm sure she'll say I was a good father - she can write about it, it'll be fun. I don't see that if she wrote a book, it's going to be an attack on me. I don't think it'll be: \"I discovered his lies.\" So it doesn't worry me. I'm sure she'd show it to me, but it doesn't really matter - I'm happy to just buy it off the bookstalls.' Uh huh. I wish Anne Theroux would publish a book, just to provoke an answering book from him - he is a writer who writes best from bile, with the juice of paranoia flowing. He is not Mr Sweetness and Light - as he says himself: 'It's quite hard to find a great writer, or even a very good writer, who is not a dysfunctional individual. It's rare to be a sweet person and a wonderful writer, though Angus Wilson was one. But writing is a process of discovering what your dysfunctions are and harnessing some kind of creative energy to all that yearning and desire and fantasising. That's what I feel writing gives to me, entering into that search.' So, what are his dysfunctions? Arrogance, obviously: that is why he can live so happily without a peer group - he doesn't ever see other people as his peers. Except his sons - he said they came to stay at Christmas and they were all playing Scrabble and he thought, 'How wonderful to be in a room with intelligent people all making jokes.' But that was a rare event for him. I get the feeling that he mentally shuts out other people, almost like an autistic. Of course he isn't autistic, but he is somehow self-enclosed. He lacks empathy, he doesn't seem to 'read' other people very well; if the people he encounters in his travels seem to behave rather weirdly, it could be because Theroux has behaved weirdly to them. You feel he has observed the human race intensely but at a distance, through literature, or through train windows, but at heart he is a Martian. That is why he might as well live in Hawaii - wherever he lived, he would never fit in. He says he can't imagine moving from Hawaii, though if he did move, it would be to one of the outer islands, or an even more remote Pacific chain. He talks a lot about Robert Louis Stevenson ending his days on Samoa. But doesn't a writer need some contact with the world? 'No, that's definitely not true. I'm very interested in writers who disappeared - B Traven, who wrote The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, lived as a total recluse in Mexico. I more easily understand the writer who cuts himself off from society than I do the one writing in a French caf\u00e9 and hobnobbing. I saw Norman Mailer last summer and he told me he's moved out to Provincetown permanently, and he's getting a lot more work done. And that's a guy in his mid-seventies. I hope I'll be like him at that age.' I hope so, too. Sir Vidia's Shadow showed that there's still plenty of juice in Theroux: he just needs a good, annoying subject. \u0095 Paul Theroux's Fresh-Air Fiend (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a320) is published on 24 February Giles Foden reviews Fresh-Air Fiend",

Julia Leigh's <strong> The Hunter</strong> tells the tale of an unnamed hunter, referred to only as M, who arrives in an isolated community in the Tasmanian wilderness determined to track down and kill the Thylacine, the last-remaining Tasmanian tiger.</p> <p>When he reaches the little bluestone house he has picked as the base camp for his forays into the mountain, he is greeted by a little girl in 'a purple Lycra catsuit studded with a galaxy of silver stars' and her brother, Bike, who is similarly clad. The children's mother spends her nights and days in a drugged stupor, numbing with sleep the loss of her husband, who disappeared on a recent trip to the mountain.</p> <p>The hunter, we are told, 'is not a children's man'. But when the girl gives him a photo of her missing father, in the hope he will find and return him, he decides to collude with her naive belief: 'I am a professional and I need this girl to manage my base camp.'</p> <p>Much of the novel is taken up with descriptions of the painstaking measures that M takes to ensure that he will be able to locate, trap and kill his prey. Rumoured sightings of the tiger remain unsubstantiated, but M is convinced that she is waiting for him. 'Somewhere, he thinks, cherishing his last thought before sleep, somewhere, out there, the last tiger stands with her back to the rising wind and slowly shakes herself awake.' </p> <p>Smeared with wallaby droppings, he prowls the mountain for days and weeks on end, a primeval presence almost at one with the ancient landscape he makes his home. Every 12 days, he returns to the base camp for fresh supplies and then back to the mud and 'the merciless rain', where his obsession turns to a hallucinatory half-life. Finally, in a mythic, dreamlike encounter, he shoots and 'harvests' the tiger, extracts its blood and ovaries for an undefined, sinister genetic purpose, and leaves the mountain with the satisfaction of mission accomplished.</p> <p>Leigh writes with taut precision and deceptive simplicity of man's most basic instincts: power, greed and the desire to pit your wits against the coolest animal on the face of Earth. M is, we're told, a sexual predator, too. During his lonely vigil on the mountain, he rehearses to himself his finely-honed seduction techniques in descriptions designed to chill the blood of any woman who's been taken in by a bout of ready charm.</p> <p>Perhaps most chilling of all is the implication that this primeval predatoriness is the natural state of things, that it is the social interaction which is artificially acquired. Leigh's slender debut is hypnotically gripping and extremely disturbing. It is not difficult to see why she was picked in this paper as one of the 21 writers to watch in the new millennium.</p> <p>Niall Griffiths's <strong> Grits</strong> couldn't be more different.

Julia Leigh's The Hunter tells the tale of an unnamed hunter, referred to only as M, who arrives in an isolated community in the Tasmanian wilderness determined to track down and kill the Thylacine, the last-remaining Tasmanian tiger. When he reaches the little bluestone house he has picked as the base camp for his forays into the mountain, he is greeted by a little girl in 'a purple Lycra catsuit studded with a galaxy of silver stars' and her brother, Bike, who is similarly clad. The children's mother spends her nights and days in a drugged stupor, numbing with sleep the loss of her husband, who disappeared on a recent trip to the mountain. The hunter, we are told, 'is not a children's man'. But when the girl gives him a photo of her missing father, in the hope he will find and return him, he decides to collude with her naive belief: 'I am a professional and I need this girl to manage my base camp.' Much of the novel is taken up with descriptions of the painstaking measures that M takes to ensure that he will be able to locate, trap and kill his prey. Rumoured sightings of the tiger remain unsubstantiated, but M is convinced that she is waiting for him. 'Somewhere, he thinks, cherishing his last thought before sleep, somewhere, out there, the last tiger stands with her back to the rising wind and slowly shakes herself awake.' Smeared with wallaby droppings, he prowls the mountain for days and weeks on end, a primeval presence almost at one with the ancient landscape he makes his home. Every 12 days, he returns to the base camp for fresh supplies and then back to the mud and 'the merciless rain', where his obsession turns to a hallucinatory half-life. Finally, in a mythic, dreamlike encounter, he shoots and 'harvests' the tiger, extracts its blood and ovaries for an undefined, sinister genetic purpose, and leaves the mountain with the satisfaction of mission accomplished. Leigh writes with taut precision and deceptive simplicity of man's most basic instincts: power, greed and the desire to pit your wits against the coolest animal on the face of Earth. M is, we're told, a sexual predator, too. During his lonely vigil on the mountain, he rehearses to himself his finely-honed seduction techniques in descriptions designed to chill the blood of any woman who's been taken in by a bout of ready charm. Perhaps most chilling of all is the implication that this primeval predatoriness is the natural state of things, that it is the social interaction which is artificially acquired. Leigh's slender debut is hypnotically gripping and extremely disturbing. It is not difficult to see why she was picked in this paper as one of the 21 writers to watch in the new millennium. Niall Griffiths's Grits couldn't be more different. Sprawling over nearly 500 pages of densely written prose, it's a kind of Welsh Trainspotting, bursting with accounts of various drug-addled states and unsavoury sexual and violent encounters.

Politically, it was post-Napoleonic, run by the rising bourgeoisie, but with the great dramas of 1848 and then the collapse of the Second Empire still to come.</p> <p>Baron Haussmann had not yet carved his great straight lines to create the grand Paris we know today; this was still a choked, mazy, post-medieval city. The Louvre and Notre-Dame were surrounded by slums and rubble, the Champs Elys\u00e9es were undeveloped and dangerous and Montmartre was a village. </p> <p>Terrible outbreaks of cholera and typhoid ripping through the city at regular intervals and consumption took a huge, regular toll.

Politically, it was post-Napoleonic, run by the rising bourgeoisie, but with the great dramas of 1848 and then the collapse of the Second Empire still to come. Baron Haussmann had not yet carved his great straight lines to create the grand Paris we know today; this was still a choked, mazy, post-medieval city. The Louvre and Notre-Dame were surrounded by slums and rubble, the Champs Elys\u00e9es were undeveloped and dangerous and Montmartre was a village. Terrible outbreaks of cholera and typhoid ripping through the city at regular intervals and consumption took a huge, regular toll. It was, undoubtedly, a great city for music, with Berlioz and Chopin among the leading figures, but its leading writers and artists - Victor Hugo, Gautier, Murger, Dumas fils, Balzac, George Sand, Chateaubriand, Daumier, Delacroix - are not as loved in Britain as their later Paris-based rivals, Toulouse-Lautrec, Manet, the impressionists, Flaubert, Proust and Zola.

Before You Sleep immerses us in the teeming imagination of Karin Blom, an unsteady terrain of bluff and tall tale, in which honest recall may twist at any moment into wild exaggeration.</p> <p>Blom is a just-thirtysomething single woman living in Oslo, assailed on all sides by a chaotic and exhausting family - mother Annie, once bewitching to all, now decaying, sister Julie, engaged despite her unfeasibly large feet, Julie's soon-to-be-husband Aleksander, a man with a cowardly smile. </p> <p>Blom stands aloof from them all, becalmed by cynicism. To act, to do anything, it seems, is to risk succumbing to genetic destiny - falling into bland marriage like her sister or endless years of narcissistic performance, like her mother. </p> <p>Blom's dilemma runs along similar lines to the demise of Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye - struggling against entrance into the adult world of phonyism and compromise. Adrift in this shabby, dutiful world, Blom finds common ordinariness needs embellishment. There are lies which pay and lies which don't, she discovers, but there are also lies which entertain, which light the everyday into flamboyant brightness. This lends to the novel a magical realist feel - scenes dissolve into impossible riots of hyperbole, characters are volatile. As her mother, Annie, returns from New York with a 'liquid face', victim of a plastic surgeon, so the world is liquid, when relayed by Karin Blom. </p> <p>Occasionally, events settle coarsely upon her before she can sift them. Upon enticing a married man to a bedroom, Blom tries to craft a soft-focus scene - wine, a steaming bath, snatches of piano tunes wafting through the window. He is impatient, pushes her to the wall, jolts her head against the brickwork. </p> <p>Once let on to a looser rein, the mind is left open to strangeness not of its own devising. Control can be lost, unsolicited visions may torment the brain. Blom tells of an adulterer who elopes with his mistress, and stares out of the plane window as night falls, apprehensive and eager. But then he sees God's face peering at him, begins to scream, shatters the silence of the cabin, sending the passengers into hysterical spasms. </p> <p>Ullmann has a skill for clouding her tales. A ribald account of a former lover with a fetish for fornication in places he associates with unpleasantness, mainly the unpleasantness of his father, is maudlin and humorously sick-hearted at the same time. </p> <p>The only family member who emerges with luminous expectations intact is Karin's semi-mythical grandfather, Rikard Blom, who left Norway because its mountains failed to overwhelm him with a sense of the sublime, preferring to trudge in wonder around the skyscrapers of Manhattan. He set up a costume shop in the theatre district in which passable beauties could don frocks that transformed them into Greta Garbo and pale-eyed men could be Clark Gable for an afternoon. He forced reality to bend around himself - he 'became exactly the man he wanted to be'. </p> <p>Though Rikard's death is faintly ignominious and absurd - he drops dead midway through a plate of spaghetti - his success in persuading others to 'make-believe' stands against Karin's embellishment of reality by interior monologue alone. In the end, her cynicism looks like the irascibility of the life-loving romantic who fears her delight in things will be snubbed and poorly returned by others. </p> <p>It's an affecting novel - the gradual accumulation of small events, small moments, winds softly around the reader.

They believed that senior army officers were ready and willing to mount a coup against Saddam Hussein. The CIA provided logistical support, including special mobile phones with direct access to the agency's station chief in Amman. </p> <p>But Saddam Hussein likes to boast that he knows who will betray him before they know it themselves. He has even set up a special intelligence unit, which has studied every coup of the twentieth century. So Saddam moved first. Hundreds of officers were arrested, tortured and executed. In one raid, an Iraqi intelligence agent found one of the CIA's special phones and used it to place a call. When an American answered he told him: 'Your men are dead. Pack up and go home.' </p> <p>Sa\u00efd Aburish, a distinguished journalist and author of a revealing life of Saddam, has unusual qualifications as a biographer. In the mid-1970s, he was a go-between for Western businesses and arms manufacturers, whom Saddam wanted to work in Iraq. So he played a part in Saddam's long-term, top-secret plan to build an arsenal of chemical and nuclear weapons. </p> <p>His career as a middle-man gave him unusually close access to Saddam and the way he thinks. His portrait shows a man who may be cruel and ruthless but is also a clear-headed, strategic thinker. Significantly, Saddam was still only vice-president when he embarked on his programme to acquire the weapons of mass destruction that could make Iraq the key player in the Middle East. Why a cultivated Palestinian like Aburish would be willing to work for one of the most blood-stained tyrants of our age says much about Arab psychology. </p> <p>Like many others, Aburish longed to back a winner and to see one Arab leader grow militarily and economically strong enough to stand up for himself. Saddam's Iraq didn't look like a bad bet. Its large population is comparatively well educated. Its women are relatively liberated. To support Saddam in the 1970s was to support the possibility of a progressive Arab state. </p> <p>At first, Saddam did not seem to put a foot wrong. He skilfully played Russia and America off against each other. He used Iraq's oil revenues to build up the economy and the military. However, it is no coincidence that he also created one of the region's most ruthlessly efficient secret police forces. As Aburish shows, Saddam's role model is Stalin. His library is lined with books about the great dictator. Like Stalin, Saddam was willing to do anything, kill anyone to modernise his country. Not that he was ever a communist, but then as Saddam sees it, nor was Stalin. </p> <p>This helps to explain the long and close relationship that Aburish documents between Saddam and the CIA. The agency first spotted him when he was an exile in Cairo, who had just tried to assassinate Iraq's head of state. Saddam became a regular visitor at the US embassy. When Saddam's faction of the Ba'ath party seized power in 1968, the CIA provided his group with a hit list of known and suspected communist sympathisers. </p> <p>Saddam showed himself to be an enthusiastic, hands-on killer and torturer. When he finally grabbed supreme power for himself, he continued to enjoy wary support from Washington. He may have been a thug, but at least he was not a communist or a religious fundamentalist. As Lyndon Johnson would have put it, we didn't care 'what kind of a bastard' was in power in Iraq, so long as he was 'our bastard'. </p> <p>The hypocrisy and amorality of Western policy make uncomfortable reading. Saddam's war on Khomeini's Iraq was his bid to be the dominant power in the region. It turned out to be his first great miscalculation. At least Saddam Hussein could count on support from the Americans, whose CIA agents delivered regular packages of satellite photographs and military intelligence to Iraq's top brass. </p> <p>This beautiful friendship came to an end when the Iran-Contra affair showed Saddam how deeply he had been betrayed by the White House. He seems to have blundered into the Gulf war. But faced with the onslaught of half a million allied troops, he is supposed to have said: 'If I survive, I win.' </p> <p>In the past decade, Saddam has survived everything the world has thrown at him: defeat in the Gulf war; popular uprisings; sanctions; assassination attempts; UN arms inspectors bent on destroying his weapons; and an air war, in which US and British pilots have flown more sorties over Iraq than Nato flew during the war in Kosovo. </p> <p>But Saddam survives, an exemplar of dos and don'ts for future dictators. In writing about the life and times of Saddam Hussein, Aburish has set himself a difficult task. Saddam grants almost no interviews, Iraq's official archives remain closed and second sources are in short supply. Despite this, Aburish's unmatched contacts in the Middle East enable him to provide a rare glimpse into the secret world of Saddam. </p> <p>The definitive, academic history may not be written until long after Saddam's demise. When it does appear, it unlikely significantly to alter or improve on the insights and perspectives found in this chilling biography.</p>",

The definitive, academic history may not be written until long after Saddam's demise. When it does appear, it unlikely significantly to alter or improve on the insights and perspectives found in this chilling biography.",

In any case, John's low self-esteem fell away when he found himself sexually. The brothers founded a courier business which in the medium term did spectacularly well. </p> <p>As a child of psychiatrists, Emma Dally acknowledges a feeling of guilt that the family had problems of its own, and this compounds the British unease with the memoir of trauma, a form that feels inherently American.

About four years ago, Klein, who had covered the Clinton primary campaign of 1992 for Newsweek, became so disaffected by what he witnessed that he found himself in a white heat writing Primary Colors, a well-informed satire about a smooth-talking, philandering Southern governor running for the White House. </p> <p>What began as a lighthearted diversion during the Democratic primary campaign became deadly serious in the Dole-Clinton presidential run-off four years later. No one who read Klein's novel could be in any doubt that Jack Stanton, the charming but duplicitous candidate, was modelled on William Jefferson Clinton. </p> <p>And, perhaps because Klein had been close to both Bill and Hillary Clinton, to the Democratic camp and, above all, to the national press corps, whom he memorably christened 'the scorpions' or 'scorps', he chose to publish Primary Colors, in the manner of an eighteenth-century polemicist, under a pseudonym. </p> <p>His inspired choice of nom de plume was 'Anonymous'. The minute Primary Colors was published, it was acclaimed by the critics for its wit and readability. Inevitably, there was an absolute tornado of speculation as to the identity of its author. Most American authors propel themselves into the limelight with lemming-like alacrity. But Anonymous was distinguished by his shyness and his secretiveness. Who could it be? </p> <p>In the ensuing fever of speculation, various names were thrown into the ring: was it Christopher Buckley, the Washington satirist? Was it Lisa Grunwald, a prominent Clintonista? Was it Elizabeth Kolbert, a New York Times reporter who'd covered the primaries? </p> <p>Some writers even took the credit themselves. The mischievous Christopher Hitchens, for example, began signing copies of Primary Colors in book stores, claiming authorship. In short, everyone had a good time, and Primary Colors became an international phenomenon, selling rights in a score of countries and more than two million copies in the USA. </p> <p>Klein, meanwhile, loudly protested his non-involvement. 'For God's sake,' he told one newspaper, 'I definitely didn't write it.' In hindsight, he protested too much. When Klein's cover was finally broken by some clever sleuthing at the Washington Post, the American press turned on one of its own with outraged cries of 'professional foul'. </p> <p>Klein had lied to the fourth estate, they whinged. He had behaved not as a journalist but more like a politician they covered. In fact, yelled the scorps, Klein had violated the nebulous but potent American code of journalism ethics. What was even more galling was that he had made a packet in the process. </p> <p>Never mind that Primary Colors was a roman \u00e0 clef written with the benefit of hindsight; to the reading public, it was a prescient skewering of Slick Willy's Teflon-coated charm. It was fiction, but in some strange way it was also fact. </p> <p>Now, it seems, Klein has done it again. Just as Senator John McCain appears poised to give George Dubbya and the Republican establishment the fright of their lives, Klein has reportedly delivered a new political novel, The Running Mate, to be published under his own name this time, in which a certain Senator Charlie Martin, a popular, maverick legislator takes on an unscrupulous political opponent, a prince of the dark arts of 'spin'. </p> <p>The Running Mate promises to be as compulsive, in its way, as that other contemporary masterpiece of American high politics, Aaron Sorkin's The West Wing, Sky Television's under-appreciated political serial. </p> <p>I haven't, of course, actually read The Running Mate. Part of its success as a highly topical publication by a publicity-wise writer will depend on the extent to which the publishers are able to control advance access to the text. In this country, the book is due from Chatto &amp; Windus, and there will, no doubt, be the usual baloney about embargo dates. </p> <p>But if Klein, with his spooky intuition of the mystery of the present moment, has managed to make his new book seem like the fictional shadow of the tumultuous political events of Spring 2000, he will have achieved the literary equivalent of being struck by lightning not once, but twice.

So its boss has to step out of the shadows on occasions. And these occasions are becoming ever more frequent. Not a week goes by now without Freeserve announcing some tie-up or alliance with another company. Last week's news was that Freeserve had embarked on developing an online soap opera. </p> <p>Pluthero guffaws when trying to explain the premise of the new series. </p> <p>'Soap opera doesn't really do it justice. In terms of TV viewing, soap operas are the most engaging, the most sticky as we would say [they keep people coming back for more]. And people talk about them, so your customers are marketeers. People go to work and say \"Oh did you see\" and people want to watch it.' </p> <p>The beauty of the Internet, though, is that it gives the soap interactivity. 'You can e-mail the characters. You can suggest things and they may go and do them. When you say \"Don't go out with him\" they may e-mail back and say \"Yes, but he's really cute\". It's an enormous, tentacled beast of interactivity.' </p> <p>The idea came when three former BT guys knocked on Freeserve's door with an idea. 'They were as mad as they come. I've met a lot of strange people in this business, and they are the strangest by far.' </p> <p>These days Pluthero estimates that every week Freeserve hears around 100 suggestions, of varying degrees of sanity, from Internet evangelists, such is the pace of change. Five minutes spent waiting in the company's reception - watching the to-ing and fro-ing of earnest young people armed with laptops and briefcases crammed with presentation slides - gives a taste of how quickly the company is evolving. </p> <p>Launched by retailer Dixons in September 1998, Freeserve started out offering free access to the Internet. The company likes to give the impression that it was the first to do this, but this is not strictly true: there were already several free Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in existence. Nevertheless, the fact that Freeserve's software -which users need to load to gain access to its ISP - was easily available through any of the Dixons group's 1,000 stores, meant it soon became the online access provider of choice. Today nearly 1.7 million users in the UK choose Freeserve. </p> <p>It was little surprise, therefore, that when Dixons decided to float a near-20 per cent stake in its subsidiary, Freeserve's shares were 30 times over-subscribed. Back then, Freeserve was valued at \u00a31.5bn. Today it is worth around \u00a38bn. The massive rise in value is largely down to the City's appreciation of what the company is trying to do. Namely, move away from making money by providing Internet access and instead focus on turning Freeserve into a must-visit online destination - a 'portal'. </p> <p>Pluthero is slightly alarming when asked whether Freeserve has achieved this transition. With the precision of a smart bomb he answers, facts dropping at the speed of a racing commentary. 'Voted by Internet magazine best portal _ our reach figures _ page impressions _ metrics around how sticky our content is _ 45-minute dwell times in parts of the site _ our chat rooms are the busiest chat rooms in Europe_ 100,000 portfolios registered on our money channel.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, it is clear that Pluthero, who started his career as a chartered accountant after graduating with first class honours from the London School of Economics, knows that more needs to be done to reinforce Freeserve's position as a mecca of the Internet. The company is to launch a massive marketing campaign next month which will put Freeserve ads on television for the first time. </p> <p>A major site redesign is in the pipeline and will also be unveiled next month. 'We're changing the architecture: it's going to be much quicker. People will see a different site when they come online. It will be cleaner. The current site hasn't really been able to deal with the growth in content.' </p> <p>A flat fee giving unlimited access - similar to the way ISPs operate in the US, where Internet usage is dramatically higher than here - will also be introduced soon. Watch out, too, for further announcements about wireless Internet alliances, with more mobile phone operators and news that Freeserve is starting to develop faster services using the latest Digital Subscriber Technology. The latter transforms local telephone networks and will allow us to watch videos over the Internet. </p> <p>Also on the cards is a European expansion programme. Another share issue will help fund the plan. 'We're getting to the point now where we can use our currency to put together the properties and the elements we need to go forward.' </p> <p>Pluthero, who joined Dixons from Bass just over six years ago, admits to being slightly shocked at the pace of change. 'I remember reading a US magazine years ago when I was on a flight and seeing an extract of the president's diary. And it's like, \"10 to 10:07, briefing from the defence chief; 10:07 to 10:10 go to the lavatory\", and his whole day was like that. I used to think that must be mad. And now I look at my diary and think _ the pace of what's happening means we are cramming years and years of development into months.' </p> <p>Each month it seems something conspires to tighten the Internet dynamic. Last month it was the AOL-Time Warner merger. A model for Freeserve perhaps? 'It was a smart move. When you put content and platform together you create an even richer seam. From a business model point of view that's pretty powerful. It's had an impact on everybody's thinking.' </p> <p>So would Pluthero look for something similar? He hints that this is now on his radar screen. 'It's there in the conversations everybody's having. We talk to lots of people all the time. The people we are talking to haven't changed, but the flavour of the conversations has.' </p> <p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong> Subject: </strong> John Pluthero </p> <p><strong> Age: </strong> 36 </p> <p><strong> Job title:</strong> Chief executive officer, Freeserve </p> <p><strong> Other directorships: </strong> None </p> <p><strong> Hobbies: </strong> Playing with his seven-year-old daughter; golf</p>",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.freeserve.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Freeserve</a>, the UK's largest Internet company, is preparing to use its rocketing share price to fund an acquisitions spree. </p> <p>The company is also set to shake up the online market by launching an unlimited Internet access service similar to the system in operation in the US, where users surf for, typically, two to three times longer than their counterparts in Britain. This will follow a major television campaign and website overhaul scheduled for next month. </p> <p>Freeserve, which was valued at \u00a31.5 billion when it floated last year, is now worth nearly \u00a38bn. The company's chief executive officer, John Pluthero, told The Observer in an interview for today's Business section: 'We floated to get a currency we could use. With the shares getting to the kind of value they are at now, we can use that currency to put together the properties and elements we need.' </p> <p>He hinted that a number of deals were coming. 'I would expect over the course of this year for there to be more than one. We've identified a number of areas where we want to acquire the right kind of capabilities. Sometimes they're quite small, and sometimes they're pretty big.' </p> <p>The fact that such a young company plans to use its paper to do deals is remarkable. It was launched in September 1998, a subsidiary of electrical retailer Dixons. Today Freeserve, which started off offering free access to the Internet, is transforming itself into a 'portal'- a must-see destination for people trying to find their way around the web. It has nearly 1.7 million users, about 100,000 more than its nearest rival, AOL. </p> <p>The Freeserve site will be changed to make navigation easier. The rapid speed with which the company has secured alliances with con tent providers and e-commerce partners has meant that the site looks crowded. It has been criticised as sometimes slow to use. </p> <p>'We're changing the architecture so it's even quicker,' Pluthero said. 'People will see a different site when they come online.' To coincide with the site's relaunch, Freeserve will advertise heavily, campaigning on television for the first time. </p> <p>Pluthero admitted that Freeserve wants to introduce a flat-rate unmetered Internet service. This follows a decision by BT to introduce its own unlimited access version, Surftime, in the spring. </p> <p>'The Nproduct takes us in that direction. I'm sure we'll get to the position soon where people are being charged between \u00a310 and \u00a315 for as much Internet as they want. If you get the pricing right, you will see a very substantial increase in the time people spend online. We've been working with a number of network providers to come up with that.' </p> <p>Pluthero hinted that rumours of a tie-up between Freeserve and a major media provider could come true. Such a deal would mirror that of Net giant America Online and Time-Warner last month. </p> <p>He said: 'We always talk to people. The people we are talking to haven't changed but the flavour of the conversations has.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Freeserve, the UK's largest Internet company, is preparing to use its rocketing share price to fund an acquisitions spree. The company is also set to shake up the online market by launching an unlimited Internet access service similar to the system in operation in the US, where users surf for, typically, two to three times longer than their counterparts in Britain. This will follow a major television campaign and website overhaul scheduled for next month. Freeserve, which was valued at \u00a31.5 billion when it floated last year, is now worth nearly \u00a38bn. The company's chief executive officer, John Pluthero, told The Observer in an interview for today's Business section: 'We floated to get a currency we could use. With the shares getting to the kind of value they are at now, we can use that currency to put together the properties and elements we need.' He hinted that a number of deals were coming. 'I would expect over the course of this year for there to be more than one. We've identified a number of areas where we want to acquire the right kind of capabilities. Sometimes they're quite small, and sometimes they're pretty big.' The fact that such a young company plans to use its paper to do deals is remarkable. It was launched in September 1998, a subsidiary of electrical retailer Dixons. Today Freeserve, which started off offering free access to the Internet, is transforming itself into a 'portal'- a must-see destination for people trying to find their way around the web. It has nearly 1.7 million users, about 100,000 more than its nearest rival, AOL. The Freeserve site will be changed to make navigation easier. The rapid speed with which the company has secured alliances with con tent providers and e-commerce partners has meant that the site looks crowded. It has been criticised as sometimes slow to use. 'We're changing the architecture so it's even quicker,' Pluthero said. 'People will see a different site when they come online.' To coincide with the site's relaunch, Freeserve will advertise heavily, campaigning on television for the first time. Pluthero admitted that Freeserve wants to introduce a flat-rate unmetered Internet service. This follows a decision by BT to introduce its own unlimited access version, Surftime, in the spring. 'The Nproduct takes us in that direction. I'm sure we'll get to the position soon where people are being charged between \u00a310 and \u00a315 for as much Internet as they want. If you get the pricing right, you will see a very substantial increase in the time people spend online. We've been working with a number of network providers to come up with that.' Pluthero hinted that rumours of a tie-up between Freeserve and a major media provider could come true. Such a deal would mirror that of Net giant America Online and Time-Warner last month. He said: 'We always talk to people. The people we are talking to haven't changed but the flavour of the conversations has.'",

How can we tax more mobile capital enough to educate our children better? But this is news-repellent and politicians wake up each day to find themselves judged not by history but by that branch of commerce known as news.</p> <p>The London mayoral race is the best example I can think of. It has given us a torrent of vivid, saleable news. It has twists, turns, eccentric characters, human frailty, deceit and a cliffhanger final page. Jeffrey Archer and the drama of libel, sex and lies.

Frank Dobson staggering under the punches, bravely grinning on through his blood-caked beard.</p> <p>Now we have Ken, like a speckled, fast-moving guerrilla leader, closing on the white-faced Caudillo in Downing Street with a fresh ultimatum. Who could resist this? Like the bitter fallings-out in Wales and Scotland, it is a human melodrama, with serious implications for New Labour and its internal politics of control. But what is it saying to the country? It suggests that devolved power is a disaster and that Blair has made a terrible mistake.</p> <p>This is nonsense. This is the news gap. For devolution is a revolution. It is a massive change in the structure of our country, whose effects will be felt for a century or more. Today's news tells us almost nothing about why it is happening. It is, in short, only news. This weekend of all weekends, we require a little perspective.</p> <p>Once, around a century ago, we had great cities with tough, talented, self-certain leaderships. In Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol and many more, as well as London, there was a progressive, public-spirited local cadre of people determined to create healthy, efficient and beautiful places out of the chaos and squalor of mid-Victorian urbanisation.</p> <p>They came from all political parties, from the radical Liberals of Joseph Chamberlain's Birmingham to the Tory and Unionist reformers, to socialists in half the towns of the country, including London. These were the people who gave up thousands of hours of their time to raise the money and hire the companies to bring lighting and proper sewerage, to carve out and plant urban parks, raise libraries, found schools, build squares and town halls.</p> <p>As a result, Glasgow was able to claim to be the first city since Roman times to pipe clean water to its citizens; Tunbridge Wells and Hull ran phone systems; there were civic tram systems, electric companies, cinemas, bath-houses. Manchester boasted a town hall larger than the Commons and a cotton exchange bigger than the London Stock Exchange. All this was done by ordinary people like us, not much better educated or particularly rich. It was done not so long ago and it made Britain a tolerable place for millions who would otherwise have found it horrible.</p> <p>Today, our cities are leaderless shadows of their former selves. Yes, there are grand projects, from the remaking of Birmingham's Bull Ring to the latest ideas for London's South Bank, pushed by central government, backed by private money, but city spirit is in fast decline. We have lost knowledge about the skill of living well together in proud urban centres.</p> <p>The causes are complicated and numerous. To get a full picture, we would have to probe the strange story of how the British stopped being able to manufacture effectively; the effects of the Blitz and new building techniques; the surrender of middle-class \u00e9lites, who moved out; the privatisation of everyday life, as the TV culture spread, and that new ruthlessness in business life, which squeezed out the notion of public-service time off work.</p> <p>Above all, we would have to consider our old centralised constitution, which has made it so easy for so many governments of Left and Right to strip power from the local in the interests of order and control, replacing democracy with quangos, Civil Service viceroys and private companies. The Livingstone story may be merry Spring mayhem, but local democracy has been the victim of a mean, tight spiral of decline for generations, in which powers are taken away, so less good people get involved, so more powers are stolen and so on.</p> <p>No one really knows whether this can be fully reversed. But Blair has been asking a simple question - what would happen if you gave people the status of direct election as mayor, and good money, and then left them a little more free to act? You will get, no doubt, some duds - British civic history is littered with white moustached fools alongside the Chamberlains and Lansburys. And when you get popular, energetic local leaders, then, if you are Tony Blair, your problems may just be beginning, since they will undoubtedly want and deserve more authority than Whitehall centralism has left them with today.</p> <p>Yet Blair's is a good question, which doesn't become a bad one because of an internal party revolt. Who is there, in the entire country, who thinks that a Britain run at city level by unpaid, low-grade councils whose powers have been stolen and for whom only a minority can be bothered to vote would be better than a Britain of strong local mayors backed by a more vigorous local democracy?</p> <p>Come to that, since this is a devolutionary issue, who really thinks Scotland and Wales would be happier if their Parliaments, with all their faults, were taken away and they were run directly by Westminster, as in the old days?</p> <p>Amid all the tee-heeing about Livingstone, Labour must keep its nerve and recall what this is really all about. London is a great city, a wonderfully vibrant, energetic megalopolis. But it has a transport system that stinks and roads so crammed that the average speed of traffic is exactly the same as it was a century ago, in the age of the horse-drawn cart.</p> <p>London has no effective mass cycle system, its Underground railway network is crumbling from decades of low investment, its air is filthy and its nurses, teachers, council workers, even police officers, find it increasingly hard to get somewhere decent to live in they can afford.</p> <p>If you know anything about the great civic achievements of European cities, of Amsterdam, Bordeaux, Barcelona, Munich, working with a fraction of the surplus wealth available in London, then these failures start to seem shameful, almost inexplicable. The same goes for a dozen more of our cities.</p> <p>And this is the big picture behind the arguments over union voting figures. The failure of New Labour to control and direct the outcome of the London mayoral contest is interesting and certainly significant for those of us watching the day-to-day drama of central government. Number 10 has played the London selection badly by failing to be true to basic principles of internal democracy.</p> <p>Yes, it's embarrassing. But what was Blair's original, much bigger, gamble? It was that city democracy and the restoration of local leadership will eventually give us better cities, regions and countries. As we contemplate the vigorous return of real argument in London, the birth-pangs of a new politics, who dares to disagree?</p>",

It was done not so long ago and it made Britain a tolerable place for millions who would otherwise have found it horrible. Today, our cities are leaderless shadows of their former selves. Yes, there are grand projects, from the remaking of Birmingham's Bull Ring to the latest ideas for London's South Bank, pushed by central government, backed by private money, but city spirit is in fast decline. We have lost knowledge about the skill of living well together in proud urban centres. The causes are complicated and numerous. To get a full picture, we would have to probe the strange story of how the British stopped being able to manufacture effectively; the effects of the Blitz and new building techniques; the surrender of middle-class \u00e9lites, who moved out; the privatisation of everyday life, as the TV culture spread, and that new ruthlessness in business life, which squeezed out the notion of public-service time off work. Above all, we would have to consider our old centralised constitution, which has made it so easy for so many governments of Left and Right to strip power from the local in the interests of order and control, replacing democracy with quangos, Civil Service viceroys and private companies. The Livingstone story may be merry Spring mayhem, but local democracy has been the victim of a mean, tight spiral of decline for generations, in which powers are taken away, so less good people get involved, so more powers are stolen and so on. No one really knows whether this can be fully reversed. But Blair has been asking a simple question - what would happen if you gave people the status of direct election as mayor, and good money, and then left them a little more free to act? You will get, no doubt, some duds - British civic history is littered with white moustached fools alongside the Chamberlains and Lansburys. And when you get popular, energetic local leaders, then, if you are Tony Blair, your problems may just be beginning, since they will undoubtedly want and deserve more authority than Whitehall centralism has left them with today. Yet Blair's is a good question, which doesn't become a bad one because of an internal party revolt. Who is there, in the entire country, who thinks that a Britain run at city level by unpaid, low-grade councils whose powers have been stolen and for whom only a minority can be bothered to vote would be better than a Britain of strong local mayors backed by a more vigorous local democracy? Come to that, since this is a devolutionary issue, who really thinks Scotland and Wales would be happier if their Parliaments, with all their faults, were taken away and they were run directly by Westminster, as in the old days? Amid all the tee-heeing about Livingstone, Labour must keep its nerve and recall what this is really all about. London is a great city, a wonderfully vibrant, energetic megalopolis. But it has a transport system that stinks and roads so crammed that the average speed of traffic is exactly the same as it was a century ago, in the age of the horse-drawn cart. London has no effective mass cycle system, its Underground railway network is crumbling from decades of low investment, its air is filthy and its nurses, teachers, council workers, even police officers, find it increasingly hard to get somewhere decent to live in they can afford. If you know anything about the great civic achievements of European cities, of Amsterdam, Bordeaux, Barcelona, Munich, working with a fraction of the surplus wealth available in London, then these failures start to seem shameful, almost inexplicable. The same goes for a dozen more of our cities. And this is the big picture behind the arguments over union voting figures. The failure of New Labour to control and direct the outcome of the London mayoral contest is interesting and certainly significant for those of us watching the day-to-day drama of central government. Number 10 has played the London selection badly by failing to be true to basic principles of internal democracy. Yes, it's embarrassing. But what was Blair's original, much bigger, gamble? It was that city democracy and the restoration of local leadership will eventually give us better cities, regions and countries. As we contemplate the vigorous return of real argument in London, the birth-pangs of a new politics, who dares to disagree?",

As winter gives way to spring, as war crimes investigators resume their exhumations of mass graves of Albanians killed by Serbs last year, an inevitable new round of revenge killings will begin. But the coming conflicts will not just pit Serb against Albanian.</p> <p>In Pristina, guerrilla fatigues have given way to cool black polo-necks and Armani. But, as fighters of the former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) settle in as the province's new ruling class, bitter internecine struggles for power, money and patronage are being waged.</p> <p>Likewise the leadership of the Kosovo Serbs is rent between those who would save the last vestiges of Serbian life here and those for whom a continuing pay cheque from Belgrade assures that Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader and indicted war criminal, still has a good many strings to pull.</p> <p>In the thick fog that often envelops Kosovo at this time of year, soldiers belonging to K-For, the 50,000-strong Nato force in the province, loom as dim shapes and barbed wire coils into the mist on Mitrovica's bridge. On the north side of the Ibar river, shadowy Serbian 'bridge-keepers' watch for hostile Albanians intent on infiltrating what has become the Serb-held north of the town.</p> <p>Before the war the vast majority of Mitrovica's inhabitants were Albanians. Like the Serbs they lived with, they inhabited both sides of the river. When French troops deployed here in June a de facto partition of the city began to take place. Serbs fled northwards and most Albanians who had been expelled or fled during the bombing were unable to return to the north.</p> <p>Who started the recent round of violence in Mitrovica hardly matters. Two Serbs in a bus protected by Nato troops were killed, a Serbian bar was attacked and rampaging Serbs then killed six Albanians and two ethnic Turks. After that, hundreds of the couple of thousand terrified Albanians who remained in the north fled south.</p> <p>The French were now attacked, verbally to start with, accused of being pro-Serb and having failed to protect Albanians in the north. British, Germans, Danes and Italians were rushed to the city. A week ago, the situation began to slip even further out of control as Albanian snipers began shooting French soldiers.</p> <p>To cross the bridge is already to cross from one country to another. In the south, Kosovo (the Serbian name for the province) is dead, but Kosova, as the Albanians call it, is alive and well. In the south, apart from several small, beleaguered Serbian enclaves, Serbia has simply vanished. Anyone so much as heard speaking Serbian on the streets risks being lynched by an angry mob or simply shot.</p> <p>In this climate of visceral hatred it is hardly surprising that organised Serbs are resisting attempts by Albanians to return to their homes in north Mitrovica. Across that bridge, 200 metres from Kosova, Kosovo is still alive and kicking. In the north, the Yugoslav dinar is still in circulation, daily papers arrive from Belgrade, the Yugoslav government still pays salaries and, almost certainly, controls much of the political life. Rumours persist that Serbian paramilitaries continue to exist in north Mitrovica despite the presence of K-For troops.</p> <p>North Mitrovica is a dark, gloomy and, for now, an icy place. French soldiers stand guard outside blocks of flats and search inhabitants as they go inside, just in case they happen to be smuggling in grenades with which to kill their odd remaining Albanian neighbour. Many of them, in turn, are Serbs 'cleansed' by Albanians from the south. In the Bel Ami caf\u00e9, where 15 Serbs were injured in a recent grenade attack, glasses still sit on the bar, the grenade's scorch mark clearly visible.</p> <p>With every day that passes a Cyprus-style green line is hardening, not only across town but across a large part of northern Kosovo. North Mitrovica backs on to northern Kosovo, which has always been almost entirely ethnically Serb and which, in turn, borders Serbia proper. Few Serbs here believe that Serbian Kosovo is a cause well and truly lost - but it does not mean to say that they do not know what they will do if and when Kosova is finally recognised as an independent state.</p> <p>Drive north from Mitrovica and suddenly it is as if you are in a land where there had been no war. In fact, since only Serbs live here (apart from a tiny number of now 'cleansed' Albanians) there was no war here. There are no tell-tale burnt houses, shattered mosques or ruined churches.</p> <p>In Leposavic, Dragan Jablanovic, the Serbian mayor, says that his people have already prepared an 'initiative for organising a referendum'. Of course, he says, it would be a 'last step', since UN Security Council resolution 1244, which ended the conflict, recognises Kosovo as part of Yugoslavia but, he says, if independence becomes a reality 'we will not be part of that independent Kosovo, even if we have to secede'.</p> <p>Rack your brains as to why you think you have read this before? Because you have.</p> <p>As Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader used to say, both before and after he organised his Bosnian Serb referendum in 1992, if Bosnia became independent what is now the legally recognised autonomous Republika Srpska would not go with it.</p> <p>Most Albanians could not care less whether the Serbs of Leposavic and the north secede. It is just that they could not let Mitrovica or the region's mines go with them. The main shaft of the Trepca complex, which when it still worked produced gold and zinc, lies in Albanian hands, the major processing plants lie in Serb hands. Most Western experts think the mines are clapped out and could never compete in today's global markets. But hope springs eternal here.</p> <p>Gazing fondly at the rolling hills of slag, most Serbs and Albanians agree on one thing. Trepca is Europe's, perhaps even the planet's, most valuable mining complex and the other side cannot have it.</p> <p>It is tempting to think that if only some tough no-nonsense negotiator like Richard Holbrooke, the architect of the Dayton peace accords for Bosnia, could sort out a compromise on Trepca and Mitrovica, then the Serbs could have northern Kosovo and Nato's troops could go home.</p> <p>Perhaps, as part of the deal, the Albanians could be compensated by giving them Bujanovac and Presevo, areas with ethnic Albanian majorities inside Serbia proper but adjoining eastern Kosovo.</p> <p>Indeed, Albanians already call these territories, with a population of more than 60,000 Albanians, Eastern Kosova. 'Greater Kosova' does not have a politically correct ring to it.</p> <p>But with everyone's attention fixed on Mitrovica or on a Montenegro constantly teetering on the brink of war, or wondering who is next for the assassin's bullet in Belgrade, few have realised that a low-level armed conflict has already broken out in this part of southern Serbia. And on the border between Kosovo and Serbia proper ,US soldiers are braced for a major flare-up, hoping against hope that they will not get caught in the crossfire.</p> <p>On 26 January Serbian police shot dead two Albanian woodcutters in the village of Dobrosin, just inside Serbia. According to Albanian sources, this was in retaliation for Albanians having shot two Serbian policemen. The people of Dobrosin promptly fled. Now between 30 and 50 armed Albanians patrol it and the Serbian police have not, for the moment, tried to drive them out.</p> <p>As we stand on the hill overlooking Dobrosin, from the Kosovo side of the border, a tractor wheezes around the corner. A man is hauling his belongings and is carrying his niece and nephew with him. Coming from another nearby village in Serbia, he says that the police questioned people the night before and, no longer feeling safe, he and his family are leaving. Nearby, a discreet American surveillance antenna sticks out above the trees.</p> <p>According to the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, 5,000 Albanians from Bujanovac and Presevo have already registered with it inside Kosovo since June. More are registered as refugees in Macedonia.</p> <p>Beyond the Nato-decreed five-kilometre buffer zone, Yugoslav troops, many of whom are Kosovo Serbs who had to leave their homes when Nato arrived, are now deployed among an Albanian population that hates them as much as they despise them in return. In a report from the other side of the border in Nin, a Belgrade magazine, a soldier is quoted as saying that the Albanian villagers 'look at us as if we were their worst enemies. I would not dare to enter some of the villages'.</p> <p>According to Captain Eric McFadden, the US officer whose 100 men are deployed here on the border, his 'hunch' is that Albanian arms are flowing along the scores of hilly trails into Serbia proper. What the Americans are frightened of is that, if and when full-scale fighting flares, it will immediately spill back over the border into Kosovo. He says: 'We have already told the Albanians in Dobrosin that if there is a conflict there and that they bring it into Kosovo, we won't allow them to do that.'</p> <p>What is clear is that the situation here, in these remote hills, is already fraying dangerously. As part of the compromise deal to achieve the post-war demilitarisation of the KLA, up to 5,000 are now being recruited into the Kosovo Protection Corps, or TMK, to use its Albanian ini tials. The UN and K-For say it is a civilian emergency unit which is supposed to react in case of earthquakes and similar such disasters.</p> <p>Pleurat Sejdiu, formerly the KLA spokesman in London and now a senior official in the new joint administrative structure which the UN has set up to share power with the locals, says that the joke is that TMK stands for 'Tomorrow's Masters of Kosova'. Albanians regard the TMK as the nucleus of their army to be. And Sejdiu, who until June was operating out of an office in a car wash off London's Finchley Road, is not really joking at all.</p> <p>In the former Yugoslav Army club in the eastern Kosovo town of Gjilan, where the local TMK is based, there is a hall with a stage. If you peep between the curtains you can see the backdrop of a giant KLA symbol and the slogan: 'Glory to the Heroes'. Unsurprisingly the TMK has not yet recruited any Serbs to the 10 per cent minorities quota which it agreed to as part of the KLA's demilitarisation.</p> <p>In his office, Shaban Shala, the local TMK chief, says that he too is worried about what is happening on the border. He says that three weeks ago a member of a Serbian special unit was shot dead, just inside Kosovo, at a place called Konculj, a gorge that straddles the border.</p> <p>According to documents found on his body, his mission had been to mine the frontier and 'blow up certain special buildings'.</p> <p>Asked if the TMK shot the Serb, Shala says: 'I can only say that the TMK helped in this action.' Which is strange, since only a handful of TMK officers are allowed to have sidearms and they are supposed to be doing jobs such as cleaning ice off the streets. They are not supposed to have any security or military functions. While Albanians believe that the Serbs are trying to cleanse the border area to make it safe for them to operate in, General Vladimir Lazarevic, chief of staff of the Yugoslav Third Army, which is stationed there, told Nin that K-For and Nato were allowing 'terrorist' attacks in Serbia and even crossing the borders themselves, possibly in an attempt 'to justify the undertaking of more drastic measures, diplomatic political and quite possibly military, as well'.</p> <p>The road from Gjilan back to Pristina leads through Gracanica, one of the Serbian enclaves. Holed up in Gracanica's monastery is Serbian Orthodox Bishop Artemije, who campaigns for a peaceful resolution of the Kosovo issue. He wants to join the UN's joint administrative structures but is opposed both by Serbian leaders in north Mitrovica and Belgrade.</p> <p>Artemije believes that the only way to save the Serbian enclaves is by being part of the new Kosovo. The Mitrovica leaders oppose him. The difference is that they believe that if Kosovo cannot be recovered for Serbia they can stay with Serbia.</p> <p>The enclaves, which are home to perhaps half of the estimated 100,000 remaining Serbs in Kosovo, have no such option to gamble with.</p> <p>Serbs wander the main street disconsolately. They have nowhere to go and, for the moment, no future. They have no hospital and not many facilities.</p> <p>Over the past few weeks Bernard Kouchner, the dynamic French doctor, activist and founder of M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, has been up here frequently, wooing Artemije and his circle and trying to get them to join the administration.</p> <p>In one meeting the Serbs accused Kouchner of having 'put us in this situation'. Enraged, Kouchner got up, puffed himself out and screamed: 'How dare you! Milosevic put you in this situation and you had better understand that!' Stunned, the Serbs fell completely silent. Days later Artemije agreed to sign up to join the administration, but then Mit-rovica exploded and the moment was lost.</p> <p>Down the hill from Gracanica you can be in Pristina's hippest restaurant in under 10 minutes. Eight months ago, the Inn of the Two Roberts was burnt out and looted, its owners refugees in the US. Today its client\u00e8le is a who's who of the new Kosovo. A powerful newspaper editor chats with Hashim Thaci, the former political head of the KLA. Gossips wonder who is more frightened of whom. Carl Bildt, the UN Secretary-General's special envoy, is at the next table with one of the so-called 'three monkeys', the powerful trio who advise Kouchner.</p> <p>The former KLA has broken into several streams. The military command has transferred to the TMK, some have been incorporated into a new political party and some are busily engaged in commandeering property and businesses using the old KLA connection. Another part remains in the so-called 'parallel struc tures', such as the KLA's old military police and its former Interior Ministry - which the UN does not yet have the will or strength to attack.</p> <p>Today Thaci has been brought in to the UN's joint administration, and some of his men are coming with him. But what this means is that many of his former comrades in arms are bitterly resentful of Thaci 'going legit'. How the power struggle pans out remains to be seen. Can Thaci shed the more dubious elements of the old KLA and become a modern European politician?</p> <p>Meanwhile, sources in Unmik, the UN people trying to run Kosovo, are not beyond playing dirty as they struggle to impose the new administration. One suggests that the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague has compromising information about Thaci.</p> <p>Why not act on this information then? 'Because,' says the source, 'it is neither realistic to do so at the moment' - nor, he adds, 'is it in our interests right now.'</p> <p>Pacing his office, Kouchner says he has to remain calm. 'The Serbs say I am in charge of a genocide against them. It is not just ridiculous but insane! Psychopathologic! We are protecting them, we are giving them schools, hospi tals, buses.' As for dealing with the Albanians, Kouchner finds them equally frustrating.</p> <p>'They are only concerned by their own suffering. They only remember their own family and community. They have not discovered it in others! It's a psychopathological area, the Balkans!'</p> <p>Outside, candles flicker in the shops, the power is out again. Yesterday there was no water. And Kosovo is bracing for a long hot spring.</p> <p>Tim Judah is the author of 'Kosovo: War and Revenge', to be published by Yale University Press on 23 March</p>",

While Albanians believe that the Serbs are trying to cleanse the border area to make it safe for them to operate in, General Vladimir Lazarevic, chief of staff of the Yugoslav Third Army, which is stationed there, told Nin that K-For and Nato were allowing 'terrorist' attacks in Serbia and even crossing the borders themselves, possibly in an attempt 'to justify the undertaking of more drastic measures, diplomatic political and quite possibly military, as well'. The road from Gjilan back to Pristina leads through Gracanica, one of the Serbian enclaves. Holed up in Gracanica's monastery is Serbian Orthodox Bishop Artemije, who campaigns for a peaceful resolution of the Kosovo issue. He wants to join the UN's joint administrative structures but is opposed both by Serbian leaders in north Mitrovica and Belgrade. Artemije believes that the only way to save the Serbian enclaves is by being part of the new Kosovo. The Mitrovica leaders oppose him. The difference is that they believe that if Kosovo cannot be recovered for Serbia they can stay with Serbia. The enclaves, which are home to perhaps half of the estimated 100,000 remaining Serbs in Kosovo, have no such option to gamble with. Serbs wander the main street disconsolately. They have nowhere to go and, for the moment, no future. They have no hospital and not many facilities. Over the past few weeks Bernard Kouchner, the dynamic French doctor, activist and founder of M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, has been up here frequently, wooing Artemije and his circle and trying to get them to join the administration. In one meeting the Serbs accused Kouchner of having 'put us in this situation'. Enraged, Kouchner got up, puffed himself out and screamed: 'How dare you! Milosevic put you in this situation and you had better understand that!' Stunned, the Serbs fell completely silent. Days later Artemije agreed to sign up to join the administration, but then Mit-rovica exploded and the moment was lost. Down the hill from Gracanica you can be in Pristina's hippest restaurant in under 10 minutes. Eight months ago, the Inn of the Two Roberts was burnt out and looted, its owners refugees in the US. Today its client\u00e8le is a who's who of the new Kosovo. A powerful newspaper editor chats with Hashim Thaci, the former political head of the KLA. Gossips wonder who is more frightened of whom. Carl Bildt, the UN Secretary-General's special envoy, is at the next table with one of the so-called 'three monkeys', the powerful trio who advise Kouchner. The former KLA has broken into several streams. The military command has transferred to the TMK, some have been incorporated into a new political party and some are busily engaged in commandeering property and businesses using the old KLA connection. Another part remains in the so-called 'parallel struc tures', such as the KLA's old military police and its former Interior Ministry - which the UN does not yet have the will or strength to attack. Today Thaci has been brought in to the UN's joint administration, and some of his men are coming with him. But what this means is that many of his former comrades in arms are bitterly resentful of Thaci 'going legit'. How the power struggle pans out remains to be seen. Can Thaci shed the more dubious elements of the old KLA and become a modern European politician? Meanwhile, sources in Unmik, the UN people trying to run Kosovo, are not beyond playing dirty as they struggle to impose the new administration. One suggests that the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague has compromising information about Thaci. Why not act on this information then? 'Because,' says the source, 'it is neither realistic to do so at the moment' - nor, he adds, 'is it in our interests right now.' Pacing his office, Kouchner says he has to remain calm. 'The Serbs say I am in charge of a genocide against them. It is not just ridiculous but insane! Psychopathologic! We are protecting them, we are giving them schools, hospi tals, buses.' As for dealing with the Albanians, Kouchner finds them equally frustrating. 'They are only concerned by their own suffering. They only remember their own family and community. They have not discovered it in others! It's a psychopathological area, the Balkans!' Outside, candles flicker in the shops, the power is out again. Yesterday there was no water. And Kosovo is bracing for a long hot spring. Tim Judah is the author of 'Kosovo: War and Revenge', to be published by Yale University Press on 23 March",

If someone wants to gain advantage then he accuses him and before you know where you are ... ' Greenhalgh could not be reached for comment yesterday.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair's administration was last night accused of hypocrisy over its ethical foreign policy when a new report revealed that the Labour Party has substantial share stakes in major arms manufacturers. The disclosure comes in a report to be published tomorrow by the Campaign Against Arms Trade. It focuses on holdings in companies which were, until last year, known as British Aerospace and GEC. A Labour spokesman last night denied any impropriety, insisting: 'We are not against the manufacture of arms. It's a big, bad world out there.' Labour holds shares in what is now BAe, the company which sold Hawk jets to Indonesia and Zimbabwe and has done business with Saddam Hussein, Augusto Pinochet and former Indonesian President Suharto. Last month, Blair insisted that Britain continue to supply Zimbabwe with spare parts for Hawk jets being used in the war in Congo and lifted a Europe-wide embargo on the sale of arms to Indonesia, imposed during the East Timor crisis. Tory defence spokesman Iain Duncan-Smith last night attacked Labour's 'double standards': 'Everywhere you turn, the ethical dimension isn't ethical. It's government as it was always practised. There's nothing different about it except their blatant hypocrisy.' The Labour Party holds the share through investments in its pension fund. What was then GEC sold the major part of its defence business to British Aerospace in November of last year. All GEC shareholders received shares in the aerospace company, and both companies subsequently changed their names. The remaining part of GEC became Marconi, specialsing in communications, while British Aerospace became BAe Systems, which is now one of the world's leading arms suppliers. The party also held 30,000 shares in Vickers when the company was bidding to sell tanks to Turkey. The Labour spokesman told the campaign: 'We have absolutely no problem with backing firms that employ hundreds of thousands of British people. [These] are major firms which play an important part in the British economy and I don't regard it as embarrassing at all that we have shares in these companies. Our pension fund is managed by trustees and by and large the rules are that we don't step in.' Blair told Jane's Defence Weekly last December that the Government was keen to prevent 'the proliferation both of weapons of mass destruction and of the small arms that are used daily to kill and maim innocent people'. Rachel Harford of the arms trade campaign said: 'The party can't be in the pockets of the arms companies and have a commitment to human rights at the same time. Blair's comments are not only shamelessly hypocritical, they are also an insult to the public.' Labour will receive a cash payment from its Vickers shares as a result of the company being sold to Rolls Royce. 'What does it intend to do with money received from an arms company which has supplied countries in regions of tension such as India, Jordan and Qatar?' asked Harford. Craig Mackenzie, director of ethics at Friends Provident Stewardship Fund, which holds the biggest share of the ethical investment market in the UK, said that the arms trade was the area where they had the strictest veto on any form of investment. 'Even companies which supply nuts and bolts to companies which make arms are banned from our portfolio,' he said. The report, part of the group's Clean Investment Campaign, also revealed that hundreds of charities, local authorities, hospitals and NHS trusts hold shares in UK arms companies. The Church of England Commissioners hold 1.6 million shares in GKN, which is involved in a \u00a33 billion arms deal to South Africa and has been bidding to sell combat helicopters to Turkey. A spokesman for the commissioners stressed that the Church of England does have an ethical investment policy but makes a distinction between those companies which make weapons which go 'bang', which they do not invest in, and those which are focused on 'supplying the UK armed forces and her allies'. 'The church has very great concerns about the arms trade, but we have different responsibilities from the campaign in that we are not a lobbying organisation but an investment one,' said the spokesman. 'We need to provide the best possible pension support for Church of England clergy. Our policy is kept under very close review.'",

And he wants the law to guarantee multiple wives the same rights as any other spouse. He is launching a challenge to the British laws against polygamy in a move regarded as a test case.</p> <p>The Iranian-born restaurateur claims that the law violates his rights to religious freedom and has hired a French lawyer to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights.</p> <p>He married each of his three wives, aged 38, 32 and 26 respectively, in a simple Muslim ceremony. Under Islamic law, a man is permitted to have up to four wives.</p> <p>'We would all feel a lot better if our marriage was legally recognised,' he said. 'Just as a lion has four females in his pride so a man can take up to four women. It is in man's nature to take more than one partner.'</p> <p>Susan Vogel, a Birmingham-based solicitor who specialises in family law and has worked closely with the city's Asian community, said that the 1998 Human Rights Act could 'conceivably' provide some justification for Siadatan's case.</p> <p>Many Muslims say the case encapsulates the debate over whether minorities have the right to follow their own customs or should conform to established British traditions.</p> <p>'Polygamy is a very difficult issue for many British liberals,' said Fuad Nahti, editor of the Muslim magazine Q-News . 'It challenges the secular establishment. It pushes the boundaries of multiculturalism.'</p> <p>Khalida Khan, director of An-Nisa, a Muslim women's group, said that there needed to be a reappraisal of the law to incorporate more of the values of Britain's ethnic and religious minorities. 'At the moment there is a parallel legal system that is completely unrecognised by the state,'she said.</p> <p>The issue is also important to other ethnic and religious communities. Some marriages conducted according to the rites of Judaism and Hinduism are also not legally recognised. Children of such unions can find themselves deprived of inheritance or other legal rights.</p> <p>Opponents of any change to British laws say that they protect those who may be coerced into marriages. Siadatan's three wives, however, profess total support for their husband. 'We are all behind him in want ing to have our marriages legally recognised,' Cinzia, his first wife, said.</p> <p>'Medi is a very honest man and we don't mind sharing him. If a man feels committed to more than one woman then there shouldn't be any legal obstacles in his way.'</p> <p>Siadatan says he tried a conventional marriage after arriving in Britain from Italy in 1975, but hated all the lying when he took up a mistress. 'So I told her the truth and the mistress moved in with us, but it didn't work out because the jealousy was so terrible.'</p> <p>He said: 'I decide during the day who I am going to be sleeping with. It depends how I am feeling. I don't have a rota system and occcasionally the four of us push the double beds together.'</p>",

He married each of his three wives, aged 38, 32 and 26 respectively, in a simple Muslim ceremony. Under Islamic law, a man is permitted to have up to four wives. 'We would all feel a lot better if our marriage was legally recognised,' he said. 'Just as a lion has four females in his pride so a man can take up to four women. It is in man's nature to take more than one partner.' Susan Vogel, a Birmingham-based solicitor who specialises in family law and has worked closely with the city's Asian community, said that the 1998 Human Rights Act could 'conceivably' provide some justification for Siadatan's case. Many Muslims say the case encapsulates the debate over whether minorities have the right to follow their own customs or should conform to established British traditions. 'Polygamy is a very difficult issue for many British liberals,' said Fuad Nahti, editor of the Muslim magazine Q-News . 'It challenges the secular establishment. It pushes the boundaries of multiculturalism.' Khalida Khan, director of An-Nisa, a Muslim women's group, said that there needed to be a reappraisal of the law to incorporate more of the values of Britain's ethnic and religious minorities. 'At the moment there is a parallel legal system that is completely unrecognised by the state,'she said. The issue is also important to other ethnic and religious communities. Some marriages conducted according to the rites of Judaism and Hinduism are also not legally recognised. Children of such unions can find themselves deprived of inheritance or other legal rights. Opponents of any change to British laws say that they protect those who may be coerced into marriages. Siadatan's three wives, however, profess total support for their husband. 'We are all behind him in want ing to have our marriages legally recognised,' Cinzia, his first wife, said. 'Medi is a very honest man and we don't mind sharing him. If a man feels committed to more than one woman then there shouldn't be any legal obstacles in his way.' Siadatan says he tried a conventional marriage after arriving in Britain from Italy in 1975, but hated all the lying when he took up a mistress. 'So I told her the truth and the mistress moved in with us, but it didn't work out because the jealousy was so terrible.' He said: 'I decide during the day who I am going to be sleeping with. It depends how I am feeling. I don't have a rota system and occcasionally the four of us push the double beds together.'",

But, most significantly, the present system of making judicial appointments is being challenged on the ground that it, too, breaches the convention.</p> <p>So when Lord Hardie, the Lord Advocate, fiercely criticised for his failure to foresee many of the difficulties, resigned last week to take up an appointment as a judge, the air was loud with protests and denunciations.</p> <p>The first point of attack was couched in uncharacteristically strong language by Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, former Tory Minister and now an MSP. He said that, by abandoning his leading role in the impending Lockerbie trial, the Lord Advocate was guilty of a 'dereliction of duty'. Relatives of the Lockerbie victims expressed anxieties that Lord Hardie was jumping ship because the prosecution case was weak - a suggestion vigorously rebutted by Hardie himself.</p> <p>But Lockerbie, say observers, played only a tangent-ial part in the decision. The Scottish bench has been denuded because the trial in Holland will absorb four Scottish judges for a year and Lord Cullen has been seconded to the Paddington rail disaster.</p> <p>The number of judges has therefore been increased to 32. And Hardie, who is 54, may have believed that this was his last chance to indulge in a traditional perk of his office - to appoint himself to the bench. Lord Advocates usually do this at the end of a government's life.</p> <p>He may also, his friends believe, have grown tired of constant criticism since he joined the Scottish Exective in May and found his conduct, more comfortably and remotely carried on at Westminster, now exposed to fierce parliamentary scrutiny.</p> <p>The formal position - that judges are appointed by the Crown on the advice of the First Minister, who consults with the Lord President (Scotland's senior judge) - is regarded as a polite fiction or a theoretical veto exercised, in recent memory, only once, to delay a by-election and not to block the appointment.</p> <p>The true source of judicial patronage is the Lord Advocate. He 'takes soundings', first with the potential candidate (last week, himself). Then he consults with the Lord President and other senior judges before making his nomination to the First Minister.</p> <p>Ten days ago, his right to do so was contested in the High Court during an action brought by campaigners fighting the Skye Bridge tolls. 'Robbie the Pict' challenged Lord Wheatley's right to sit on the bench as he had been appointed by the Lord Advocate, who is also the public prosecutor.</p> <p>Professor Robert Black, the chair of Scots law at Edinburgh University, said that 'only in Scotland' were criminal judges appointed by the court prosecutor. 'It is a clear breach of the convention.'</p> <p>The High Court will hear the application on 3 March, but observers believe it is unlikely to succeed. They say that when the use of temporary judges was ruled illegal it was on the ground of their insecure tenure - not that they had been appointed by the Government.</p> <p>Indeed, some observers take a relaxed view of developments. Donald Dewar himself pointed out in parliament that of the 337 'devolution cases' relating to the convention, only eight had been lost by the Crown, of which two were under appeal. Joe Thomson, Regius Professor of Law at Glasgow University and a member of the Scottish Law Commission, believes the system has produced a Scottish bench of outstanding quality.</p> <p>He also rejects as 'grotesquely unfair' criticisms that Hardie had failed to anticipate the legal challenges . 'The whole thrust of law is to test things. He could not have done very much in anticipation.'</p> <p>Some observers think the Scottish supreme courts, under the leadership of Lord Rodger, may have been interpreting the impact of the convention more liberally than elsewhere in Europe.</p> <p>In the case of Margaret Anderson Brown, Lord Rodger noted that the convention restored the position under Scots common law, which gave the right to remain silent and which had been overridden by the statute on which the police had relied.</p> <p>Most observers believe there are two ways out of the dilemma. The first is to remove the Lord Advocate from his executive function and from the Cabinet. This is regarded as an unlikely outcome. It is much more probable that a Judicial Appointments Board will be set up on the lines advocated by Scotland's longest-serving judge, Lord McCluskey, who has now retired. He said in December that judicial appointments could no longer be left in the hands of politicians if allegations of cronyism were to be avoided.</p> <p>The impact of Scottish decisions on England and Wales will not become clear until after October, when the Human Rights Act applies the European Convention to UK law. But already a host of challenges are predicted.</p> <p>The convention is changing the legal character of the UK in another way. It is increasing the power of the courts and investing them with a constitutional function, with the Privy Council emerging as a kind of constitutional court from which the appeal is to Strasbourg.</p> <p>In a landmark judgment last week, Lord Rodger and Lord Prosser ruled that the Scottish Parliament was a creature of statute and did not enjoy sovereignty. As such, it could be held accountable by the courts.</p> <p>This was no surprise, their lordships said; the Scottish Parliament had simply joined the family of parliaments in the democratic world whose actions were also open to judicial review.</p> <p>Lord Rodger, indeed, im-plied that the Westminster Parliament was now something of an oddity. It was Henry VIII, Professor Thomson noted, who had invented the whole idea of sovereignty. The old Scottish Parliament had never claimed it. Nor can it now.</p>",

He may also, his friends believe, have grown tired of constant criticism since he joined the Scottish Exective in May and found his conduct, more comfortably and remotely carried on at Westminster, now exposed to fierce parliamentary scrutiny. The formal position - that judges are appointed by the Crown on the advice of the First Minister, who consults with the Lord President (Scotland's senior judge) - is regarded as a polite fiction or a theoretical veto exercised, in recent memory, only once, to delay a by-election and not to block the appointment. The true source of judicial patronage is the Lord Advocate. He 'takes soundings', first with the potential candidate (last week, himself). Then he consults with the Lord President and other senior judges before making his nomination to the First Minister. Ten days ago, his right to do so was contested in the High Court during an action brought by campaigners fighting the Skye Bridge tolls. 'Robbie the Pict' challenged Lord Wheatley's right to sit on the bench as he had been appointed by the Lord Advocate, who is also the public prosecutor. Professor Robert Black, the chair of Scots law at Edinburgh University, said that 'only in Scotland' were criminal judges appointed by the court prosecutor. 'It is a clear breach of the convention.' The High Court will hear the application on 3 March, but observers believe it is unlikely to succeed. They say that when the use of temporary judges was ruled illegal it was on the ground of their insecure tenure - not that they had been appointed by the Government. Indeed, some observers take a relaxed view of developments. Donald Dewar himself pointed out in parliament that of the 337 'devolution cases' relating to the convention, only eight had been lost by the Crown, of which two were under appeal. Joe Thomson, Regius Professor of Law at Glasgow University and a member of the Scottish Law Commission, believes the system has produced a Scottish bench of outstanding quality. He also rejects as 'grotesquely unfair' criticisms that Hardie had failed to anticipate the legal challenges . 'The whole thrust of law is to test things. He could not have done very much in anticipation.' Some observers think the Scottish supreme courts, under the leadership of Lord Rodger, may have been interpreting the impact of the convention more liberally than elsewhere in Europe. In the case of Margaret Anderson Brown, Lord Rodger noted that the convention restored the position under Scots common law, which gave the right to remain silent and which had been overridden by the statute on which the police had relied. Most observers believe there are two ways out of the dilemma. The first is to remove the Lord Advocate from his executive function and from the Cabinet. This is regarded as an unlikely outcome. It is much more probable that a Judicial Appointments Board will be set up on the lines advocated by Scotland's longest-serving judge, Lord McCluskey, who has now retired. He said in December that judicial appointments could no longer be left in the hands of politicians if allegations of cronyism were to be avoided. The impact of Scottish decisions on England and Wales will not become clear until after October, when the Human Rights Act applies the European Convention to UK law. But already a host of challenges are predicted. The convention is changing the legal character of the UK in another way. It is increasing the power of the courts and investing them with a constitutional function, with the Privy Council emerging as a kind of constitutional court from which the appeal is to Strasbourg. In a landmark judgment last week, Lord Rodger and Lord Prosser ruled that the Scottish Parliament was a creature of statute and did not enjoy sovereignty. As such, it could be held accountable by the courts. This was no surprise, their lordships said; the Scottish Parliament had simply joined the family of parliaments in the democratic world whose actions were also open to judicial review. Lord Rodger, indeed, im-plied that the Westminster Parliament was now something of an oddity. It was Henry VIII, Professor Thomson noted, who had invented the whole idea of sovereignty. The old Scottish Parliament had never claimed it. Nor can it now.",

Until then I hadn't thought about it.'</p> <p>Many things, it seems, have come along later for this woman. It's instructive to realise that, back in the early Eighties when Blondie first swept up the British charts, and every now-dad spent every waking moment lusting furiously after their gorgeous bottle-blonde lead singer, she was already in her early thirties: almost unthinkable now, when we're lucky if our chart-topping sex vixens are past puberty. So she's in her early fifties now, and touring again, gyrating madly in her red dresses on stages around the world, and finally coming to terms with the fact that she has to please the money-men, who are, after all, in the process of putting out a new Blondie album ( Livid ) for her.</p> <p>Early fifties... I'd wondered whether she would look it up close. She certainly hadn't looked it at Glastonbury last year, but the stage was 50 feet away and the sun was making everyone look good. (She laughs as I remind her of some of the pieces written about her dancing: there was some bitchy press carping about Deborah's style, the implication being that she shouldn't really have been allowed to be there at that age. 'What the hell,' she smiles, dropping in a few other epithets - she swears blithely, fluently, sweetly - 'I like a bit of verbal abuse now and then; I find it quite exciting.')</p> <p>Up close, she looks it even less. Steady, calm, blue-green eyes, flawless skin, and those absurdly Slavic cheekbones... well, there's a certain tiredness to her, her face seems strangely larger than expected, and she happily bends forward to show me her very human, very brown roots: but fifties, no way. She's used to the compliment, but still takes it graciously. Had she ever minded her good looks, or worried that they got in the way? 'Not really. I suppose.. when I was growing up, yeah, I got my fair share of perverts.'</p> <p>She grew up in New Jersey with foster-parents, having been given up for adoption shortly after her birth in Florida. There were stories that she had fantasised for many years about being the daughter of Marilyn Monroe; she says she did idolise Marilyn, but not in that complex fashion, not in any seriousness. She has since, she says, taken some steps towards finding who her real parents were. 'There was certain information I needed to have for health reasons. But I never went beyond a certain point. Apart from anything else, I know too much about valuing my own privacy to want to intrude on someone else's.'</p> <p>She still has no family of her own, but that doesn't cause her any particular worries - though she does admit she would have liked a child; it is 'one regret. But, then again, I haven't added to overpopulation. Because I've always objected to the fact that so many people just fuck and have children, that people are not planning children but just getting off sexually. It depresses me to think that most of the world's an accident.</p> <p>'In terms of family, though, I feel that I am now content with who I am, and I have friends. I have, if you like, a family of choice.'</p> <p>It's a very Sixties, Warhol phrase, and thus suitable. For people can forget, in the standard Deborah story - the years spent nursing her lover, Blondie guitarist Chris Stein, back to health after a serious illness; the split-up with Chris that followed; the silent years and acrimony and then, recently, the successful reunion and new generation of fans - that she was also a big friend of Warhol and player on the New York art scene.</p> <p>The music - well, she loves it, she says, but it needn't have been music that made her name. Over the past decade she's also acted, written short stories - 'they're OK, but I don't think I'm a great writer; for that you need a truly original voice - and worked in art and photography; a true New York renaissance woman. 'Whether I had gone into rock 'n' roll, or any other kind of performance, I think I would always have had been engaged in some kind of search,' she says, slightly annoyingly; there are too many fey Californian generalisations floating about for complete comfort. 'I'm always searching for understanding; for people to understand me, or for me to understand them. The beauty, the discrepancies, the horrors, the ugliness.'</p> <p>But, in fact, it's OK when she talks like that: she backs her argument with quotes from William Gibson, and various Nigerian authors she's reading at the moment; and she is regarded in the art world as an intelligent critic. Also, she's refreshingly direct about the rest of her life - drugs ('well, yes,' she says, giving a smile. 'But not as much as before of course. I'm still a glutton for sensation. But there's not too much partying, really; I enjoy a glass of wine and a cigarette. But I can hardly keep up.') She smiles again when talking about men (she lives alone with her pet dog Chi-Chen). 'Yes I would like to meet the right guy, some day, of course. But, at the moment... well, I do, um, date now and again.'</p> <p>Direct, too, on what's happening now in terms of women and music. 'Britney Spears and the rest... well, I think it's boring, quite frankly. Money seems to be the big motive, the only motive, behind everything. Which I suppose is understandable, but still... why did it happen that way? Well, I think it's misogyny, pretty much. The music-business world is not exactly heavily represented by women. And I'm not so much criticising the music, but - well, people used to try to say something, didn't they? People used to believe in things.'</p> <p>She's an odd one, this rather cold, rather clever woman. Fifty-three years old, looking about 31, happily talking the language of pensioners.</p>",

Early fifties... I'd wondered whether she would look it up close. She certainly hadn't looked it at Glastonbury last year, but the stage was 50 feet away and the sun was making everyone look good. (She laughs as I remind her of some of the pieces written about her dancing: there was some bitchy press carping about Deborah's style, the implication being that she shouldn't really have been allowed to be there at that age. 'What the hell,' she smiles, dropping in a few other epithets - she swears blithely, fluently, sweetly - 'I like a bit of verbal abuse now and then; I find it quite exciting.') Up close, she looks it even less. Steady, calm, blue-green eyes, flawless skin, and those absurdly Slavic cheekbones... well, there's a certain tiredness to her, her face seems strangely larger than expected, and she happily bends forward to show me her very human, very brown roots: but fifties, no way. She's used to the compliment, but still takes it graciously. Had she ever minded her good looks, or worried that they got in the way? 'Not really. I suppose.. when I was growing up, yeah, I got my fair share of perverts.' She grew up in New Jersey with foster-parents, having been given up for adoption shortly after her birth in Florida. There were stories that she had fantasised for many years about being the daughter of Marilyn Monroe; she says she did idolise Marilyn, but not in that complex fashion, not in any seriousness. She has since, she says, taken some steps towards finding who her real parents were. 'There was certain information I needed to have for health reasons. But I never went beyond a certain point. Apart from anything else, I know too much about valuing my own privacy to want to intrude on someone else's.' She still has no family of her own, but that doesn't cause her any particular worries - though she does admit she would have liked a child; it is 'one regret. But, then again, I haven't added to overpopulation. Because I've always objected to the fact that so many people just fuck and have children, that people are not planning children but just getting off sexually. It depresses me to think that most of the world's an accident. 'In terms of family, though, I feel that I am now content with who I am, and I have friends. I have, if you like, a family of choice.' It's a very Sixties, Warhol phrase, and thus suitable. For people can forget, in the standard Deborah story - the years spent nursing her lover, Blondie guitarist Chris Stein, back to health after a serious illness; the split-up with Chris that followed; the silent years and acrimony and then, recently, the successful reunion and new generation of fans - that she was also a big friend of Warhol and player on the New York art scene. The music - well, she loves it, she says, but it needn't have been music that made her name. Over the past decade she's also acted, written short stories - 'they're OK, but I don't think I'm a great writer; for that you need a truly original voice - and worked in art and photography; a true New York renaissance woman. 'Whether I had gone into rock 'n' roll, or any other kind of performance, I think I would always have had been engaged in some kind of search,' she says, slightly annoyingly; there are too many fey Californian generalisations floating about for complete comfort. 'I'm always searching for understanding; for people to understand me, or for me to understand them. The beauty, the discrepancies, the horrors, the ugliness.' But, in fact, it's OK when she talks like that: she backs her argument with quotes from William Gibson, and various Nigerian authors she's reading at the moment; and she is regarded in the art world as an intelligent critic. Also, she's refreshingly direct about the rest of her life - drugs ('well, yes,' she says, giving a smile. 'But not as much as before of course. I'm still a glutton for sensation. But there's not too much partying, really; I enjoy a glass of wine and a cigarette. But I can hardly keep up.') She smiles again when talking about men (she lives alone with her pet dog Chi-Chen). 'Yes I would like to meet the right guy, some day, of course. But, at the moment... well, I do, um, date now and again.' Direct, too, on what's happening now in terms of women and music. 'Britney Spears and the rest... well, I think it's boring, quite frankly. Money seems to be the big motive, the only motive, behind everything. Which I suppose is understandable, but still... why did it happen that way? Well, I think it's misogyny, pretty much. The music-business world is not exactly heavily represented by women. And I'm not so much criticising the music, but - well, people used to try to say something, didn't they? People used to believe in things.' She's an odd one, this rather cold, rather clever woman. Fifty-three years old, looking about 31, happily talking the language of pensioners.",

Mothers are the source of all nourishment, and always the most important members of their families, unless they die.</p> <p>4. No child under five should have to see his father unless the mother wanted him to, because if she were anxious about contact the child could develop a condition called 'splitting'. After hearing all this, the mother panics and backs out of her agreement.</p> <p>Court Welfare Officers write 35,000 reports a year: these affect the lives of 70,000 children.</p> <p>By training, they are criminal probation officers. When they take on this specialised job, they receive no extra training in child development, and no guidelines about how to interpret such concepts as 'reasonable contact'. Most of the reports they write are based, therefore, on personal conjecture.</p> <p>What effect have their recommendations had on the families concerned?</p> <p>It is hard to say. In the 20 years since the Family Court Welfare Service was founded, there has not been a single follow-up study. The service has never checked its officers' reports for anything except spelling. Because court records are closed to the public, nobody else can check them either. This is why the Family Court Experience comes as such a shock to so many users.</p> <p><b> CASE NO 2: JOHN </b></p> <p>Certainly, it was a shock to a man we will call John.</p> <p>His daughter was six months old when he left the marital home at his wife's request. She did not want him to see the child, but he persisted. One day, after John took the girl to a swimming pool, the mother complained to social services staff, alleging that he had forced the girl to put her head under water. Although they decided that the allegation was not true, this did not stop the Court Welfare Officer from alluding to the episode at hearing after hearing.</p> <p>At one point in the proceedings, the judge even went so far as to ask the father to promise never to take his daughter swimming again. After two years of legal battles, John won the right to have his daughter for overnight visits. Since that time, he has had no trouble with contact. Relations with the child's mother, Jan, could not be more cordial.</p> <p>'All the issues have gone. I won because I'm strong emotionally,' he says. But many parents in his position cannot call on these resources, and the legal battle can break them.</p> <p><b> CASE NO 3: RICHARD </b></p> <p>This is what happened to a man we will call Richard, a major in the Army and the father of two very young children.</p> <p>He was devoted to their mother, despite the fact that she was violent, often with the help of a knife. He never reported the incidents, but one day Marion attacked him in the street and a bystander called the police.</p> <p>Divorce proceedings began soon afterwards. Marion works full-time. Although Richard also works full-time, his hours are shorter and he was always the primary carer. But once he had left the marital home, Marion was obstructive about contact, as he had feared.</p> <p>And the violence continued, too. One day, when he saw her with their children in the street and waved, she tried to run him over with her car. By now, Richard had found out that Marion had a 16-year record of violence and psychiatric problems.</p> <p>She had files with both the police and social services. In spite of this, and even after Richard found bruises all over one child's body, the courts let her keep the children. One judge justified this by saying that, all things being equal, children under five were much better off with their mothers.</p> <p>What Richard would like to know is, how unequal do things have to be before a judge will override that prejudice? Richard has not seen his children for two and a half years. He has, he thinks, recovered from the mental breakdown he had two years ago, although he says: 'I'm still not the man I was.'</p> <p>He hopes to get his children back one day. And because they are still young, it is not too late to reverse any alienation they may have suf fered. He is referring here to 'parent alienation syndrome' or hate campaigns waged on children by one of their parents against the other.</p> <p>It is a term you hear a lot in courts in the United States. It is not a problem that worries our own Family Court Welfare Service. But that is not to say it does not happen. Here's a classic case.</p> <p><b> CASE NO 4: STEVEN</b></p> <p>Steven and Jessica have been separated for two years when the story begins. Both are in new relationships. The son lives with Jessica.</p> <p>But one day he asks Steven if he can come and live with him. His father jots a note to Jessica, asking her what she thinks. Jessica takes offence and begins to make difficulties about contact.</p> <p>After one disputed visit, Steven is told that the boy returned home unhappy. Then he is told that there is to be a cessation of contact. Then he discovers that Jessica has contacted social services staff alleging that Steven forced the boy to have a bath with him while he had an erection.</p> <p>Some allegations of abuse must be true, and so all must be taken seriously. But you have to wonder when you hear about cases in which mothers suddenly allege abuse at a time when it will give them an edge in a dispute over contact.</p> <p>When he heard about Jessica's allegation, Steven went straight to the Family Protection Unit. It decided after investigation that the allegations had no merit. But this was not enough to clear his name during the years of litigation that followed.</p> <p>At the same time, the mother could do no wrong in the eyes of the court. No one was concerned, for example, when she said: 'Ian would rather be dead than reconnect with his father'. Nobody asked if she might be putting psychological pressure on the boy to turn against his father. 'As an adult one can cope. But what about the little lad?', Steven says. In his view, he has lost his son because the court welfare service is heavily biased in favour of women.</p> <p>It is not, however, a bias that works in the favour of women who are non-resident parents, or women who are foreigners.</p> <p><b> CASE NO 5: ROSA </b></p> <p>Certainly it did not work in the favour of a Swiss woman we'll call Rosa. Her marriage ended seven years ago, when her husband, an Englishman, beat her up and left home in the middle of the night, taking with him their older child, then aged six. Rosa tried and failed to get her daughter back. Eventually she settled for reasonable contact.</p> <p>Six weeks after the divorce was final, Rosa's daughter found her father dead in the shower. By the time Rosa found out about it, the girl was in the care of her paternal grandmother, who had already applied for residency. The application seems to have been supported by vague allegations of abuse. Rosa has not been able to see her daughter again.</p> <p>For a while, the grandmother did allow Rosa's younger child to visit his sister in her new home. During these visits, the grandmother told him that his mother was a criminal, and like a chocolate onion - sweet on the outside, but if you bite into it, watch out.</p> <p>Rosa insists that she does not blame her for these, or any, of her vicious lies. 'She is just following her nature,' she says. Like all of the other parents I spoke to, she blames the professionals and the system within which they work.</p> <p>Contrary to popular opinion, custody disputes do not lead inexorably to out-and-out war. Divorced couples who manage to stay well away from the courts are often able to come to civilised agreements.</p> <p>Most of the conflicts they cannot sort out on their own, they can resolve, and resolve rapidly, if they take advantage of the new, still very small, but very effective, Family Mediation Service.</p> <p>If they cannot deal with them amicably here, then of course the law has a part to play.</p> <p>But even when divorced parents go to court, the first aim should still be to keep children connected with both parents wherever and whenever possible.</p> <p>The Family Welfare Service, however, resolves conflicts by choosing sides. And until very recently, the losing parties suffered mostly in silence.</p> <p>When the nation wondered why it was that so many fathers left home and lost touch with their children within the year, and why it was that about 900 other fathers were driven to kidnap their children every year, they rarely asked how many of those absent and kidnapping parents had been barred by the Family Welfare Service from seeing their children.</p> <p>But now things are changing.

      "body": "<p>It is a most unlikely alliance in the cause of peace: a former member of the Irish National Liberation Army and a Church of England vicar are working together to help ease tensions between terrorist groups in Ireland.</p> <p>The Rev David Armstrong, a vicar in the city of Cambridge, wears the dog collar of the Anglican Communion, while Terry Harkin, the spokesman for the INLA's political wing in Britain, the Irish Republican Socialist Party, sports a badge on his lapel with a red star, clenched fist and a Kalashnikov rifle.</p> <p>Armstrong has invited Harkin to address his congregation about the INLA's proposed non-aggression pact with its loyalist enemies. The last time his parishioners heard of the INLA was probably over 20 years ago, when the terror group murdered Margaret Thatcher's close aide, Airey Neave, in the House of Commons car park.</p> <p>Armstrong, a former Presbyterian minister forced from his previous parish by bigots who objected to his warm relations with Catholics, regularly passes messages from the INLA via Harkin to loyalist paramilitary leaders in a bid to prevent violence breaking out on Northern Ireland's streets.</p> <p>Harkin said Armstrong was approached to act as a go-between with the loyalist paramilitaries shortly after the republican splinter group declared a ceasefire last year.</p> <p>'Although we opposed the Good Friday Agreement, we did not want to snipe from the sidelines,' said Harkin. 'The IRSP proposed a non-aggression pact between the various factions that would stop violence in loyalist and nationalist working-class areas of Belfast. Our comrades in the INLA have a long history of attacking loyalists, so the non-aggression pact was a practical way to ease tensions between us.</p> <p>'David's name was mentioned as a possible go-between and we knew he had left the North to live in England. Some of our prisoners knew David when he was chaplain at Magilligan prison outside Derry, where he had earned the respect of both sides. I searched every Presbyterian directory in Britain but couldn't find him.'</p> <p>The reason was that, after being hounded out of Northern Ireland 15 years ago, Armstrong left the Presbyterian Church.

      "bodyText": "It is a most unlikely alliance in the cause of peace: a former member of the Irish National Liberation Army and a Church of England vicar are working together to help ease tensions between terrorist groups in Ireland. The Rev David Armstrong, a vicar in the city of Cambridge, wears the dog collar of the Anglican Communion, while Terry Harkin, the spokesman for the INLA's political wing in Britain, the Irish Republican Socialist Party, sports a badge on his lapel with a red star, clenched fist and a Kalashnikov rifle. Armstrong has invited Harkin to address his congregation about the INLA's proposed non-aggression pact with its loyalist enemies. The last time his parishioners heard of the INLA was probably over 20 years ago, when the terror group murdered Margaret Thatcher's close aide, Airey Neave, in the House of Commons car park. Armstrong, a former Presbyterian minister forced from his previous parish by bigots who objected to his warm relations with Catholics, regularly passes messages from the INLA via Harkin to loyalist paramilitary leaders in a bid to prevent violence breaking out on Northern Ireland's streets. Harkin said Armstrong was approached to act as a go-between with the loyalist paramilitaries shortly after the republican splinter group declared a ceasefire last year. 'Although we opposed the Good Friday Agreement, we did not want to snipe from the sidelines,' said Harkin. 'The IRSP proposed a non-aggression pact between the various factions that would stop violence in loyalist and nationalist working-class areas of Belfast. Our comrades in the INLA have a long history of attacking loyalists, so the non-aggression pact was a practical way to ease tensions between us. 'David's name was mentioned as a possible go-between and we knew he had left the North to live in England. Some of our prisoners knew David when he was chaplain at Magilligan prison outside Derry, where he had earned the respect of both sides. I searched every Presbyterian directory in Britain but couldn't find him.' The reason was that, after being hounded out of Northern Ireland 15 years ago, Armstrong left the Presbyterian Church. Hardline unionist members of his congregation had objected to him visiting the local Catholic church in Limavady, Co Derry, to wish his Catholic neighbours a happy Christmas. His opponents in the parish also censured him for attending a Mass after loyalist extremists bombed the local Catholic church. The Armstrong family sustained a campaign of abuse and boycott and eventually left Northern Ireland in total disillusionment. When Harkin discovered Armstrong was working as an Anglican vicar in Cambridge, he contacted him and asked if he would act as mediator between loyalists and republicans. Armstrong said: 'I agreed to take up the job because I saw it as an extension of the work I had been doing in Northern Ireland in building bridges across the community. I will do anything to stop the rule of the gun-almighty back at home, and if that means talking to paramilitaries I will do so.' He has briefed loyalist political leaders, such as David Ervine from the Progressive Unionist Party, on the INLA's recent intentions. His aim, he says, is to build trust between organisations such as the Ulster Volunteer Force and the INLA, historically the most unstable republican terror group in Ire land. Although senior UVF leaders in Belfast have told The Observer they are sceptical about the INLA's intentions, Armstrong has passed several position papers from the republican paramilitaries to the loyalists. He has also offered to act as a mediator between the INLA and the largest loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Defence Association. So far, there has been no response from the UDA to his offer to act as go-between. 'One of my main goals is for INLA members to eventually meet with a loyalist political leader like David Ervine.

      "body": "<p>The Irish government has blocked moves by US prosecutors to interview a dozen witnesses from Ireland who might shed light on the Florida IRA gun-running plot.</p> <p>The decision by the Republic's Department of Justice has been criticised by Fine Gael leader John Bruton, who accused the government last night of having an '\u00e0 la carte approach to the enforcement of law'. In contrast to the police south of the border, the RUC is co-operating fully with US police in the investigation into the gun plot.</p> <p>The refusal to allow Federal prosecutors to interview witnesses, who include several garda officers, will slow preparations for the trial of Belfast businessman Conor Claxton, Anthony Smyth, Siobhan Browne and Michael Mullan, scheduled for 24 April. More than 100 pistols and machine-pistols had already been smuggled into Northern Ireland for the Provisional IRA via the Florida arms route before the FBI closed in.</p> <p>Lawyers for the defendants admitted there was no incentive in the Republic for the state to act as a 'handmaiden for US prosecutors'.</p> <p>US federal investigators and defence lawyers were set to go to Dublin and Belfast this month to receive depositions from potential witnesses, including some of those who received weapons from Florida through the post.</p> <p>The depositions were to be videotaped and played at the trial, since US prosecutors have no way of forcing Irish citizens to appear in court across the Atlantic. But officials in Dublin have turned down US requests to arrange the depositions.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Justice in Dublin said a mutual assistance request was received from the US authorities in relation to the Florida plot.</p> <p>'A response to the question has been issued to the US authorities,' he said. However, the spokesman refused to elaborate on the nature of their response, specifically if the department had denied the request.</p> <p>He added that following the first request to interview witnesses in Ireland, the US authorities sought a second opportunity. A response will be forwarded to the US following assessments by the gardai.</p> <p>Assistant US attorney Richard Scruggs refused to comment on the Irish depositions. However, he added that his office was receiving full co-operation from the authorities in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Last month Irish authorities dropped charges against Jacqueline McIntyre, Claxon's common-law wife, due to alleged irregularities in the gardai investigation. It meant senior IRA members from Belfast whom the gardai and the RUC believe were central to the arms plot would not be named in Irish courts.</p> <p>Bruton said his party would be tabling a question in the Dail later this week calling on the Minister for Justice, John O'Donahue, to explain why Ireland had refused to co-operate with the United States over the Florida arms investigation. 'There may be cases where Ireland will need the assistance of the US authorities in pursuing serious crimes committed by persons in our jurisdiction but now living in America. If we are unwilling to be consistent in offering co-operation to the US authorities engaged in the valid prosecution of serious crime in their jurisdiction, we will not be able to look for it in return,' he said.</p> <p>Although both the garda press office and the Department of Justice have refused to give reasons as to why Ire land has hampered US investigations into the Florida gun-running, an Irish official in New York was more candid.

      "bodyText": "The Irish government has blocked moves by US prosecutors to interview a dozen witnesses from Ireland who might shed light on the Florida IRA gun-running plot. The decision by the Republic's Department of Justice has been criticised by Fine Gael leader John Bruton, who accused the government last night of having an '\u00e0 la carte approach to the enforcement of law'. In contrast to the police south of the border, the RUC is co-operating fully with US police in the investigation into the gun plot. The refusal to allow Federal prosecutors to interview witnesses, who include several garda officers, will slow preparations for the trial of Belfast businessman Conor Claxton, Anthony Smyth, Siobhan Browne and Michael Mullan, scheduled for 24 April. More than 100 pistols and machine-pistols had already been smuggled into Northern Ireland for the Provisional IRA via the Florida arms route before the FBI closed in. Lawyers for the defendants admitted there was no incentive in the Republic for the state to act as a 'handmaiden for US prosecutors'. US federal investigators and defence lawyers were set to go to Dublin and Belfast this month to receive depositions from potential witnesses, including some of those who received weapons from Florida through the post. The depositions were to be videotaped and played at the trial, since US prosecutors have no way of forcing Irish citizens to appear in court across the Atlantic. But officials in Dublin have turned down US requests to arrange the depositions. A spokesman for the Department of Justice in Dublin said a mutual assistance request was received from the US authorities in relation to the Florida plot. 'A response to the question has been issued to the US authorities,' he said. However, the spokesman refused to elaborate on the nature of their response, specifically if the department had denied the request. He added that following the first request to interview witnesses in Ireland, the US authorities sought a second opportunity. A response will be forwarded to the US following assessments by the gardai. Assistant US attorney Richard Scruggs refused to comment on the Irish depositions. However, he added that his office was receiving full co-operation from the authorities in Northern Ireland. Last month Irish authorities dropped charges against Jacqueline McIntyre, Claxon's common-law wife, due to alleged irregularities in the gardai investigation. It meant senior IRA members from Belfast whom the gardai and the RUC believe were central to the arms plot would not be named in Irish courts. Bruton said his party would be tabling a question in the Dail later this week calling on the Minister for Justice, John O'Donahue, to explain why Ireland had refused to co-operate with the United States over the Florida arms investigation. 'There may be cases where Ireland will need the assistance of the US authorities in pursuing serious crimes committed by persons in our jurisdiction but now living in America. If we are unwilling to be consistent in offering co-operation to the US authorities engaged in the valid prosecution of serious crime in their jurisdiction, we will not be able to look for it in return,' he said. Although both the garda press office and the Department of Justice have refused to give reasons as to why Ire land has hampered US investigations into the Florida gun-running, an Irish official in New York was more candid. Eamonn McKee, from the Irish consulate in New York, said revelations about the Florida gun-smuggling paled in significance compared to the bigger question of IRA decommissioning. 'Politically, the Florida situation hasn't created as much of a stir because of the overall importance of the decommissioning issue. The whole gun-running business is a sub-set of that,' McKee said. The revelation last summer that the Provisional IRA was still involved in smuggling guns into Northern Ireland, despite its 1997 ceasefire, severely dented unionist confidence in the peace process. Further revelations that a branch of the Irish state is refusing to co-operate with the Americans in prosecuting those involved in the arms smuggling will only bolster unionist fears that Dublin is operating a policy of appeasement towards the IRA.",

      "body": "<p>Britain's soaring hospital death rate - linked to lack of hygiene and spreading super-bacteria - can be traced to a third, unexpected cause: the rise of deadly human fungi. </p> <p>This source of misery, illness and death is generally unrecognised. Yet it accounts for a major portion of the 5,000 deaths that the National Audit Office last week highlighted as being due to poor hygiene in British hospitals. </p> <p>Technically a type of living organism that is most closely related to plants, fungi are now the third biggest killer of hospital patients. </p> <p>'Ten years ago, most people thought human fungal infections gave us athlete's foot and not much else,' said Professor Neil Gow, of the Institute of Medical Sciences in Aberdeen. 'But now, the situation is different. They have become a major cause of serious, life-threatening blood infections - particularly for people who have compromised immune systems. They are triggering large numbers of deaths of patients in Western hospitals.' </p> <p>Such individuals include people affected by Aids, the immune disorder, as well as cancer and leukaemia patients who are undergoing bone marrow surgery. As part of the treatment of this latter group, marrow cells - the source of cells in the immune system - are removed from their bodies, leaving patients with a weakened ability to fight infections. </p> <p>Thousands are now treated this way every year, creating a group of immuno-compromised individuals that swells in numbers every year. And of these men, women and children, more than a third will develop fungal infections, organisms that can exist harmlessly in our bodies - until our immune systems are disrupted. </p> <p>'Such individuals have a 50-50 chance of survival,' added Gow. In these cases, candida fungal infections that produce the condition known as thrush in healthy people can spread throughout their bodies infecting heart valves, eyes, and the bloodstream. </p> <p>In addition, the fungus aspergillus which is found growing on dead leaves, stored grain, and compost heaps can trigger allergic reactions in people with asthma or deadly lung infections. Such invasions can also affect eyes, the brain and the kidneys. </p> <p>It is also known that very young children and elderly people are vulnerable to fungal infections - and it is therefore expected that they will kill increasing numbers of people as the population of the Western world gets older in response to demographic changes. </p> <p>In that case, medicines capable of dealing with this rising catalogue of illness will become increasingly important. And that is what worries many researchers. </p> <p>'There are only two classes of drugs that can deal with dangerous fungal infections,' said Gow. 'The first, known as azoles, are safe but are useless at dealing with any kind of aspergillus infection, and that is a serious limitation. The second, polyenes, are fine, but are only used as a last resort - for they are toxic as hell.' </p> <p>As a result, scientists are now desperately trying to understand how fungi spread and cause illness in humans. Bacteria such as the ones that cause illness like cholera produce their effects in a way that is understood by scientists: they release toxins. But it is less well understood why fungi - which do not - can have such a deadly impact on the human body. </p> <p>'We need to find out why if we want to develop the new anti-fungal drugs that we are going to need in the very near future,' said Gow.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's soaring hospital death rate - linked to lack of hygiene and spreading super-bacteria - can be traced to a third, unexpected cause: the rise of deadly human fungi. This source of misery, illness and death is generally unrecognised. Yet it accounts for a major portion of the 5,000 deaths that the National Audit Office last week highlighted as being due to poor hygiene in British hospitals. Technically a type of living organism that is most closely related to plants, fungi are now the third biggest killer of hospital patients. 'Ten years ago, most people thought human fungal infections gave us athlete's foot and not much else,' said Professor Neil Gow, of the Institute of Medical Sciences in Aberdeen. 'But now, the situation is different. They have become a major cause of serious, life-threatening blood infections - particularly for people who have compromised immune systems. They are triggering large numbers of deaths of patients in Western hospitals.' Such individuals include people affected by Aids, the immune disorder, as well as cancer and leukaemia patients who are undergoing bone marrow surgery. As part of the treatment of this latter group, marrow cells - the source of cells in the immune system - are removed from their bodies, leaving patients with a weakened ability to fight infections. Thousands are now treated this way every year, creating a group of immuno-compromised individuals that swells in numbers every year. And of these men, women and children, more than a third will develop fungal infections, organisms that can exist harmlessly in our bodies - until our immune systems are disrupted. 'Such individuals have a 50-50 chance of survival,' added Gow. In these cases, candida fungal infections that produce the condition known as thrush in healthy people can spread throughout their bodies infecting heart valves, eyes, and the bloodstream. In addition, the fungus aspergillus which is found growing on dead leaves, stored grain, and compost heaps can trigger allergic reactions in people with asthma or deadly lung infections. Such invasions can also affect eyes, the brain and the kidneys. It is also known that very young children and elderly people are vulnerable to fungal infections - and it is therefore expected that they will kill increasing numbers of people as the population of the Western world gets older in response to demographic changes. In that case, medicines capable of dealing with this rising catalogue of illness will become increasingly important. And that is what worries many researchers. 'There are only two classes of drugs that can deal with dangerous fungal infections,' said Gow. 'The first, known as azoles, are safe but are useless at dealing with any kind of aspergillus infection, and that is a serious limitation. The second, polyenes, are fine, but are only used as a last resort - for they are toxic as hell.' As a result, scientists are now desperately trying to understand how fungi spread and cause illness in humans. Bacteria such as the ones that cause illness like cholera produce their effects in a way that is understood by scientists: they release toxins. But it is less well understood why fungi - which do not - can have such a deadly impact on the human body. 'We need to find out why if we want to develop the new anti-fungal drugs that we are going to need in the very near future,' said Gow.",

After six years of gestation and nearly two years of workshops, The Silver Tassie received its world premiere last Wednesday at a Coliseum abuzz with culture\u2019s truffle-hunters. The throng of composers in the audience was tribute enough to the esteem, and affection, in which this British composer, 40 this year, is held.</p> <p>His fourth opera and second ENO commission is based on Sean O\u2019Casey\u2019s play, here crafted into a tight, clear libretto by Amanda Holden. If anything, her necessarily abbreviated version strengthens the sententious original which Yeats, in his role as manager of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, rejected in 1928. The subject is war and the pity of war. Harry, a handsome soldier home on leave, has just won the football cup (the silver tassie of the title, which in turn refers to a song by Robert Burns). He, Barney and Teddy return to the trenches, leaving behind Harry\u2019s elderly parents and their womenfolk. Teddy is blinded; Harry paralysed. Barney is awarded the VC for saving Harry\u2019s life, but steals his girlfriend. Tormented, Harry spies on them kissing at a club dance. The two men fight and Harry is thrown from his wheelchair. Blind Teddy and paralysed Harry go home, clutching in each other the small comfort of the hopeless. Everyone else carries on dancing. </p> <p>The work is in four acts with linking orchestral interludes, the first pair during the Great War, the second in peacetime. The visual world of William Dudley\u2019s design combines a gritty Dublin with the formal grouping of soldiers and guns. Turnage has said that he conceived the opera as a symphonic structure, with the first act establishing theme and motives, the second (set in the trenches) an adagio, the third (in hospital) a skittering, sour scherzo and a dance-hall finale. Even without this insight, the structure is readily apparent. As no score was available because of late changes, I must rely on a first hearing. But Turnage\u2019s deft and precise handling of mood and character sang out. The bright, sprung chords of the opening, exploding lightly then fizzing away, intercut with turbulent, whooping brass, immediately pointed up the dichotomy of this \u2018tragi-comic opera\u2019. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f4e600c3136ebbc1af8860affa09eeb8bb32dbed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4e600c3136ebbc1af8860affa09eeb8bb32dbed/0_0_1717_2411/712.jpg\" alt=\"Gerald Finley, top, in The Silver Tassie.\" width=\"712\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gerald Finley, top, in The Silver Tassie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Harry\u2019s parents, Susie next door and Mrs Foran, a neighbour, dominate the first act as they wait for the men to return from the match. For each, the orchestra paints a different colour . Harry\u2019s old father (John Graham-Hall), blustering, proud, is accompanied by a low, lurching pizzicato dance. His irritable, anxious wife has a forlorn woodwind figure, the oppressed Mrs Foran (Vivian Tierney) wistful strings. At the climax of the act, Harry sings the sentimental \u2018Silver Tassie\u2019 (\u2018Oh bring to me a pint of wine/ and fill it in a silver tassie,/ That I may drink before I go/ a service to my bonny lassie\u2019) while a pitiless, sombre brass volley warns of the tipsy soldiers\u2019 pending departure. </p> <p>As so often, Turnage distorts regularity of harmony or rhythm by smudging the edges, so an ironic little waltz insinuates itself in the middle of stridently military rhythms and mood. Snatches of Irish fiddle smile in the thick of menacing high trumpets or wildly screeching piccolos. This layering and weaving of extraneous styles and songs into his own, not grafted on but absorbed and purposely audible, is characteristic of the entire piece. </p> <p>The second act, set in the trenches, is a surprise. Here O\u2019Casey ventures into the realms of expressionism Yeats so despised. The Croucher (Gwynne Howell), prophesies doom, looking down at the valley of dry bones to which mankind has reduced itself. On stage, a group of cold, wet soldiers sing, often in lusty unison, of the golden brimstone butterfly and the sunlit lane back home, until interrupted by an enemy attack. </p> <p>Turnage chooses this ugliest of scenes to write his most lyrical music. Where we expect a hard centre, he offers a soft one. This act is like a concerto for strings and an oratorio rolled into one. A solo violin traces a mournful song over cellos and violas while the men sing out, boys as stretcher bearers piping out their bright chant. Insistent low double basses thud like a beating heart. Britten\u2019s War Requiem and Billy Budd, Tippett\u2019s Concerto for Orchestra, Vaughan Williams\u2019s war-torn Pastoral Symphony and even Holst\u2019s \u2018Mars\u2019, in the banging wood of bows on strings, cast an inspirational shadow - a whole tradition of English music of which Turnage has never seemed so much a part. Echoes of Berg, Bart\u00f3k and Henze are there too, but little of the jazz with which so many of his scores are shot through. </p> <p>Throughout, Holden\u2019s words were impressively audible. Turnage\u2019s preference for writing in the middle range of the voice helps enormously. Nothing sounds strained or unnatural. With the benefit of workshops, he found that the orchestra was drowning out the voices so he made adjustments. Perhaps the absence of that visceral excitement of voice and orchestra vying for attention prompted a slight reserva tion, as if discretion had won over raw impact, the edginess of black humour lost in favour of mellow melancholy. Yet if Turnage\u2019s aim, as seemed the case, was to distil the grotesqueness of war into an aural equivalent of the serial geometrics invented by C.R.W. Nevinson (freshly familiar from the recent Imperial War Museum exhibition), he succeeded. </p> <p>The third act, with its rapid-fire wind writing, shows Turnage at his grittiest best, and indeed from thereon, the music gets better and better. The snapping, biting orchestral repartee underlines Harry\u2019s bitter ness and humiliation. Far more could be said about this rich score. For now, room remains only to praise Bill Bryden\u2019s well-judged, unsensational production and the excellent cast, chorus and orchestra, conducted by Paul Daniel. A momentary lack of focus in the pit will doubtless be redeemed in further performances. The astonishing star was the baritone Gerald Finley, making his ENO debut as Harry, who in the fourth act performed one of the most remarkable pieces of sustained singing I can remember hearing, full of fantasy, colour and depth. This opera needs you. Go.</p>",

In a self-conscious tribute to the glory days of the modern movement, which certainly left a mark on Conran, the Design Museum is a dazzling white box. Like the Bauhaus, its walls are as smooth and pristine as if they had just been squeezed out of a machine. Like the Bauhaus, it announces itself with a piece of heroically scaled typography, stacking one sans-serif letter above another.

At last week's UUP meeting at the Waterfront Hall, Laird was instrumental among the ranks of pro-Trimble spin doctors who ensured that journalists got the right message.

Last year he saw off a move by members of his Orange lodge to have them expelled from the Order for their 'offence' of attending a Roman Catholic funeral for three victims of the Omagh bombing in Buncrana, Co Donegal. The elevation of both men to the House of Lords, like the simultaneous ennoblement of Baroness Blood, the Shankill community activist, was recognised as just and proper by liberal unionists. But the fact that both men are running companies involved in political lobbying raises questions about the role of lobbyists in Northern Ireland, and highlights the absence of a code of practice regulating public affairs in Stormont. Last September The Observer revealed that Kevin Reid, the son of Scottish Secretary John Reid, offered 'unprecedented access' to clients of his employers, Beattie Media. The affair highlighted the role of lobbyists in the devolved Parliament and the lack of regulation among practitioners. In the wake of the Good Friday Agreement, there has been a mini-growth industry in lobbying companies competing for the ears of Ministers and assembly members for the benefit of their clients. Joining veteran lobbyists such as Drury's and Laird's have been local offshoots of long-established Westminster firms Shandwick and Westminster Strategy. Some of Northern Ireland's PR companies, such as Burnside Citygate and AV Browne, have added lobbying to their corporate services, while at least one special lobbying company, Stratega, has been established to represent clients in their new dispensation. The collapse of the 10-week-old executive is little hindrance, as all of the above companies have cultivated contacts among the senior civil servants who make the small but important day-to-day decisions under direct rule. For the really important issues, these companies can access Westminster to reach their Northern Ireland Office Ministers and members of the Select Committee of Northern Ireland. There is, unlike for Westminster lobbyists, no operational code of practice in the Province. In the wake of the cash-for-questions scandal of the last Tory government, lobbyists hurriedly opted for a self-regulatory code of practice, akin to the rules of behaviour on MPs and peers set out by Lord Nolan's committee on standards in public life. These standards have become part of the Good Friday Agreement Code of Conduct, which 'Ministers must at all times' adhere to. The code of conduct set up by the Association of Professional Political Consultants, (APPC), operated in Westminster, but not in Stormont, a situation which Richard Gordon of Stormont Strategy is keen to recognise. His employer, Michael Burrell, chairman of Westminster Strategy, is also chairman of the APPC, and both men are keen to see the appliance of the APPC code of practice in Northern Ireland. Gordon, whose clients include the Parades Commission, wants all NI lobby firms to sign up, so as to 'see ourselves as working to the highest standards'. All companies and their employees must 'personally sign the code' because if the APPC code has any value, it is as an asset for lobbying companies. But the code raises problems for Laird and Rogan. It states that 'it is a condition of membership of the APPC that its member firms, its staff and non-executive consultants should accept and agree to abide by this code'. Further, Article 8 of the code says: 'Political consultants should not place themselves in a position of potential conflict of interest, for example by appointing to their main or subsidiary board ... any MP, MEP, sitting peer or any member of the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or NI Assembly; making any award or facilitating the holding of equity in any member firm; or payment in money or in kind to any MP, MEP or sitting peer.' When contacted by The Observer , Laird denied any conflict of interest. There was no difficulty with his role as chairman of a PR company which offered clients 'public affairs' consulting, he said. He said he had never, as a peer, lobbied personally on behalf of his clients in Westminster, and had 'never heard the issue voiced' as to whether he had a conflict of interest. On any occasion when he had spoken on issues relevant to his company's clients, such as the Police Federation NI, he insisted that he had always made it clear that a relationship existed. 'It is important that one maintains the very highest standards,' he said. 'Lobbyists have to be cleaner than clean.' He said that he wanted his company to sign up to the APPC's code of conduct but saw no conflict of interest between his roles as lobbyist and peer, as he had, he said, not lobbied any of his fellow peers personally. He dismissed another query about his personal lobbying in Westminster on behalf of the UUP. He said that the UUP was not a client,and all such lobbying was personal and unpaid. Richard Gordon, however, believed that the 'strong policy and advisory role' of Laird and Rogan had no 'precedent in the UK'. Lobbyists who happened to be senior Ulster Unionists 'need more than a Chinese wall' between their political and business lives. Laird and Rogan, although sitting as crossbenchers in the House of Lords, face a professional quandary. Their linkage to the UUP means that they may disqualify their companies from signing up to the APPC's code of conduct. Both are listed by the firms they chair, and although neither directly lobby for their party or clients in the Lords, they could be perceived as being in a conflict of interest by the strict rule of the APPC. Further, neither have declared their PR roles in the Register of Lords' Interests, which makes mandatory the declaration of 'financial interest in businesses involved in parliamentary lobbying on behalf of clients', and 'other particulars relating to matters which Lords consider may affect the public perception of the way in which they discharge their parliamentary duties (discretionary)'. The House of Lords' website, which lists those peers who have chosen to declare their interests, has no entry for Lords Rogan or Laird in its last update, dated 10 February, 2000.

The Labour Party will have decided which candidate should go forward to fight the mayoral election against Steven Norris. He is campaigning right up to the end.

Tourists will not be allowed to take drinks aboard: they've bent a rule for Ken, though. But he thoughtfully tucks the cup out of sight when the TV cameras are rolling: 'If people see me with it, then they'll think anyone can,' he jokes, deliberately self-depracatingly. For the camera, he mouths a few enthusiastic if anodyne statements of the sort politicians make when talking about the internet, and tells the viewers how he's planning to use it as a tool for open government once he's mayor. It's over in a flash. 'Great,' says the TV crew.</p> <p>'And now you'll cut that down to about 30 seconds,' mocks the man who would be mayor. While the crew protests, he turns back to enjoy the amazing view of the city he was born in, lived in, and was once political leader of.</p> <p>He has turned up alone, as he almost always does, but once inside the enormous wheel's pod, he is the centre of attention. Today, alongside the nice people from British Airways' marketing team, are two photographers, the TV crew and a journalist: me. I've been following him around for weeks, watching the final throes of this extraordinary campaign.</p> <p>It had begun as a joke. When John Prescott had first presented the White Paper, 'A Mayor and Assembly For London', Ken had stood up in the Commons and thanked him for 'such an exciting and radical new job opportunity'. When he launched his campaign - a year ago - the papers viewed him and his supporters as quaint, as Old Labour, stuck in the past: 'Back to the 80s as Ken rallies faithful' ran the headlines. Almost weekly, the papers announced another reason why he'd never be able to stand. Yet he survived. And as the campaign grew and the party's grass roots rebelled against the Millbank yoke, it looked, astonishingly as if Ken was the race favourite. Suddenly, he was the centre of Britain's media attention again. But the last few weeks have seen the certainty of easy victory slipping away.</p> <p>'Aha!' he mugs for me and the other members of the press when his pager goes off. 'Message from base.' And he looks towards Parliament, now shrinking below us. Everybody laughs.</p> <p>As the pod finally descends, we approach County Hall, the GLC HQ from where he had once waged his astonishing war on Thatcherism. Now he starts to chat earnestly, like the autodidact he is, about the history of the building. 'Built during World War One,' he says. 'Cost was no objective.' He liked the place. He has never quite forgiven Portillo for masterminding its sale to the Japanese company Shirayama Shokusan at what he believes was a knock-down price. 'They were terrified that if the Labour Party got in '92, we were going to give it back to the GLC,' he says.</p> <p>Now he peers back towards the place where he once wielded power. 'Look.' He points the windows out to me. 'That was my old office. The fourth and fifth window,' he smiles. He remembers looking out from it at the Thames at night. 'Beautiful,' he says.</p> <p>To the west is St James's Park, and Buckingham Palace. 'How long,' he suddenly wonders out loud, 'before some Tory MP with binoculars announces you can see into the Queen's bedroom from up here?' Another snort of laughter fills the pod.</p> <p>One thing has been clear every time I have seen him on this long, bruising and often bitter campaign trail. Whatever the result, after almost a decade and a half away from the front pages, Ken Livingstone has been having the time of his life.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the polls finally closed. London Labour Party members, trade unions, Greater London Assembly candidates, MPs and MEPs have all now finally voted for Frank, Ken or Glenda.</p> <p>But so much more than a mayorship depends on the outcome. While Conservatives were coping with their own public farce, the Labour Party has seen what could have been a simple ballot turn into a convoluted struggle for the soul and future of the party: as significant a set-to as Kinnock's fight to expel Militant, or - the irony of it - Kinnock, Smith and Blair's fight to bring One-Member-One-Vote-style democracy to the party. That's the way Blair saw it, anyway, pleading for his party to step into line in a series of impassioned anti-Livingstone speeches. It has been a battle long waiting to happen: between the grass roots and the centre of New Labour.</p> <p>And in the middle of all this was Ken. The trainspotterish man in the rumpled grey-green suits, with the squashy-looking face and the blackboard-scraping adenoidal estuary English is still one of the most beloved and most charismatic figures in British politics, the man all the polls said most Londoners wanted - and the man New Labour clearly did not want.</p> <p>For Ken, spinning slowly over the city in the London Eye, this bright, white-painted new symbol of all that the city could be, this year-long battle with his own party has left him twitchy, paranoid, even. When London Eye architect David Marks asks him when the results of the poll will be announced, he explains the three-day rule (no result was to be announced for at least three days from the scrutineer receiving the ballot papers, to give time for any procedural improprieties to be reported). 'Three days where no one knows what's happening. Suspicious minds worry about all this,' he mutters.</p> <p>Let's rewind, and play the story again. It is mid-January, at the tail end of the 'membership lists' scandal, another of Millbank's attempts to shoot down Livingstone that largely ended up hitting the party's own foot - at first, only Blair's favoured candidate, Frank Dobson, was given access to them.</p> <p>Had the election been fought on the One-Man-One-Vote principle Blair had battled to put in place for the party leadership elections, Livingstone would be the mayoral candidate. However, the process Millbank chose is more complex. Grassroots London Labour Party members commanded a third of the votes; trade unions and co-ops also had a third. The remaining third belonged to London's Labour MPs, MEPs and candidates for the Greater London Assembly.</p> <p>It was obvious from early on that the latter third were voting almost unanimously for Blair's choice, weighting the contest heavily against Ken and Glenda Jackson. So every London party member's vote is crucial.</p> <p>But now Ken's small team has finally received its copy of the membership lists, and Ken spends the weekend at the Livingstone For London HQ in Hanson Street, just north of Oxford Circus, folding his newly printed campaign document 'Winning London for Labour' and stuffing it into the envelopes, addressed with the newly acquired Labour membership mailing lists.</p> <p>HQ is two rooms, two floors apart, in an advertising agency run by the man who used to be director of publicity for the GLC. They moved in in October. Until then, they had used Ken's assistant Simon Fletcher's home address for all their post. The campaigning team that Blair so fears is a small, ramshackle operation. I know. I've rung them frequently as the campaign grew to try and find out when the next meeting was, only to get through to a voicemail that never seems to be answered. Then, just when I was tearing my hair out, that peculiar voice would announce on my phone: 'Ken Livingstone here.'</p> <p>As the weekend draws to a close, Ken decides that he, Simon and his second assistant, Mark, deserve a treat. The 54-year-old politician loves to eat out. Since former editor Rosie Boycott asked him to become a restaurant reviewer for Esquire magazine ('for no reason I could conceive'), Ken's fondness for restaurants has increased. As has his waistline. His taste in wine has developed, too. Ken likes a drink. He's moved with British tastes over the years, through Chardonnay to the oaky New World wines, and now he says he's starting to fall in love with really good Riojas.</p> <p>Ken decides on Granita in Islington. 'With all its political significance!' he smiles. Granita was the restaurant in which Tony Blair and his cadre had planned his bid to lead the Labour Party.</p> <p>Tonight, he relaxes: he gets smashed. Three brandies after dinner. 'Which is a lethal mistake,' he explains to me later, as I traipse around after him. But on this night, he has fun. It turns out to be one of the last chances for them to let their hair down, because the next week is about to be the bitterest of the campaign.</p> <p>It starts on Monday night - the day Norris is confirmed as Tory candidate to replace the disgraced Lord Archer. Some time before the papers are finally put to bed, members of Dobson's team start receiving calls about an article that's just appeared in the new issue of The Face. Would they care to comment?</p> <p>Ken remembers doing the article last December. It was, he'd thought, a bit of fun.</p> <p>'Tell us a joke,' the magazine's journalist had said. 'Salman Rushdie is on a train,' Ken obliged surreally, 'and it pulls into the station and he sees Yasser Arafat... he was so overcome at seeing his great hero that he rushed to embrace him...' And so on. The punchline ended: 'Never go for a Shiite while a train is in the station.' Not the most politically expedient of jokes, certainly. However, it was another off-the-cuff comment that he was about to be hung with.</p> <p>As mayor, how would you respond to a J18 or a Battle of Seattle-type situation? In retrospect, it was probably a mistake to answer: 'I have always been in favour of direct action. One of my fondest memories was chasing the inspector of the Archway Road inquiry out on to the roof at the Central Hall...'</p> <p>By Tuesday morning's papers, this idle tomfoolery has been transformed by The Daily Telegraph into 'Livingstone backs City riots as his moderate mask slips'. The article quotes Dobson and members of his team, which infuriates Livingstone. 'When the papers phoned me up when Frank was being attacked about making a joke about the Dome,' he complains, 'I said, \"I'm sure he didn't mean that. I'm sure it was just a joke.\"'</p> <p>Later in the day, the Evening Standard joins in with what looks like a deliberately timed attack by Labour Party member and journalist Peter Kellner: 'Why Tony fears Ken: a three-page report attacking Ken's record at the GLC'. 'What's bizarre,' sighs Ken, 'is that British editors think they can tell Londoners that their memories are false.'</p> <p>Nevertheless, the campaign is taking its toll. 'I am not sleeping quite as well as I should.' Sometimes, he says, he wakes at four in the morning, alert. Or he'll go to bed at two and then the phone will start ringing at six the next morning. He's looking tired.</p> <p>Mercifully, he has little trouble actually going to sleep. He reads a page of his book and he's gone. At the moment, he's working his way through 60s sci-fi writer Orson Scott Card's Ender Wiggins trilogy. If anything confirms his image as the super-geek, it's his love of sci-fi. He's on the second one: Speaker for the Dead. Ender is a child trained to play computer games. Unwittingly, he is actually being used to fight real space battles and wipes out an entire civilisation. Thus he becomes the most despised man in the universe, condemned to wander the universe as a pariah. 'No,' he answers my obvious question wearily. 'No parallels at all. I just think it's a very good book.'</p> <p>William Hill is quoting the odds on him being the first mayor of London at 5/2. His mum used to gamble every day. Ken imagines the fun she'd have indulging two of her favourite passions simultaneously by betting on her own son's career. 'It's such a shame she didn't live three more years,' he says.</p> <p>Ken doesn't like gambling at all. He remembers trying it once, in 1992 in California, where the lottery prize was around $50 million. He thought if he won he'd be able to solve the funding problems of the left at a stroke. When he didn't, he was resentful. 'I like winning,' he explains simply.</p> <p>But by the next day, the anti-Livingstone tone the press has been taking this week seems to have been raised another notch. On 19 January, the Evening Standard and The Guardian also come out with articles condemning Ken's record. The Standard 's, by Gordon Brown, is particularly damaging.</p> <p>Ken works on rebuttal articles for both newspapers, pledging loyalty to the party again. It is crucial to reassure the voters Tony is trying to win over: his own polling suggests he's ahead, but only by a tiny margin. 'That's the most annoying thing. It suddenly takes three or four hours out of my day.'</p> <p>On a typical day in the office, Mark will be updating Ken's website on the computer, and Simon will be fielding calls. Tacked on the wall is a hand-rendered rough for a press advert - obviously rejected. It reads: 'The only way Frank Dobson can become more popular than Ken Livingstone: resign.'</p> <p>In their second room, a trendy young woman dressed in an unofficial campaign T-shirt that depicts Ken as Che Guevara is carrying out phone polls. The unofficial T-shirts are being advertised at \u00a314 in Time Out. Another woman is stuffing envelopes with the stacks of campaign leaflets. 'Well...' she says with a smile, 'it's exciting, though, isn't it.' She is playing a part in what everyone knows must be a historic political battle.</p> <p>The day will get worse. In a Labour Party meeting in central London, Blair weighs into Ken. 'Think long and hard. Because if you pick the wrong candidate, you might yet regret it,' he pleads with the audience. But astonishingly, the PM is greeted by boos and heckling. He looks thrown by it.</p> <p>That evening at 8pm, Ken is to address Labour Party members in Wimbledon. He travels to Waterloo, gets on a small train and looks at the passengers. He notices they all seem to be reading the Evening Standard. Some are reading the first edition, with the headline 'Brown lays into Red Ken', others are reading the late edition, with the head line 'Blair's attack on Livingstone'. People look up and see who has joined them in the carriage. And, as Londoners usually do, they smile at him. In his mind, this is proof that despite the anti-Ken abuse, little is sticking.</p> <p>21 January. By Friday, he is actually feeling quite bullish. 'If Frank's campaign was taking off and going smoothly, they wouldn't have done it,' he says. The next day, the Evening Standard has trailed his article on its front page: 'You've got me wrong, Tony.'</p> <p>Shaun Ley, the BBC political editor for London, has an appointment to meet Ken this morning at the Atrium, the restaurant on Millbank where politicians are usually thick on the ground. He's going to film an interview for BBC2's Around Westminster.</p> <p>Livingstone arrives, switches off the ever-present mobile phone and prepares for his interview. 'You see The Mirror today - \"Dead as a Dobbo\"?' Ley, too, notices a confidence creeping into Livingstone's answers. Today, he seems more interested in discussing the nuts and bolts of the mayoral job, the mechanics of how the mayor is going to work with the newly elected assembly. It's as if he's thinking that the battle now is Steven Norris, not the Labour Party.</p> <p>'Have you heard?' Ken tells me, beaming from ear to ear. 'Norris has come out for cannabis today.' Actually, he decides, that's quite a clever move. He tells me he reckons the further he can distance himself from Hague, the better Norris's chances are.</p> <p>The weekend comes. On more relaxing days, Ken likes to walk in the heavily wooded area of Hampstead Heath, watching the sunlight come through the birches and the oaks. You feel completely cut off from the city there. Not that Ken would ever like to live anywhere outside London. He starts to get itchy after a week in the countryside. But he would love a house with a garden backing on to the Heath. 'Sadly,' he says, with a smirk, 'I don't think the mayoral salary will stretch to that.'</p> <p>In more normal times, he goes to the cinema at least once a week. 'Oh Gawd, I see loads of 'em. Last one I liked? The one about the old man riding his lawnmower.'</p> <p>He loves the zoo, too. He's been going there since he was a kid. One of his main campaign speech soundbites is nostalgic: about how easy it was to get around London as a kid in those days. He tempts the party and union members with the idea that London could be like that again.</p> <p>Ken's garden in the Cricklewood house he shares with his partner Kate is one of his favourite places. It contains an enormous pond he built there in 1990. He's stocked the pond with frogs: Rana esculenta, better known as edible frogs - not that he eats them. Quite the opposite. One day in early winter, he noticed one of the baby frogs - no bigger than a little fingernail - hadn't developed its legs fully. He took it out and put it in a goldfish bowl in the dining room. It's there still. When the last frost is done, he'll put it back in the pond and it'll be able to catch up with the others. If his house burned down and he could only save one thing he thinks he'd save that frog. It sounds a little ridiculous, he knows, 'but having put so much effort into nursing it...' he explains.</p> <p>It's 10.30am on Saturday morning and only a couple of dozen people have gathered for the GMB union hustings. 'Well,' says Glenda Jackson, the only candidate who has made it on time, 'it looks like you're going to just have me.' Bored, she starts singing loudly to herself. Ken arrives, looking harried. 'I'm finding the days just flash by.' He sits down next to her. By this stage, the seating arrangement for these hustings has been set: Glenda in the middle, Ken on one side and Frank on the other.</p> <p>Ken and Glenda have struck up a rapport during the race for the candidacy, less because they are natural political bedfellows, more because, they have both become exasperated at the way the Millbank machine has tried to run the election. Ken pulls out a sheaf of phone-message slips. Glenda raises her eyebrows. 'Are they just messages from today?' she asks, almost jealously.</p> <p>'No. They're ones I couldn't get through on Thursday and Friday.' Ken's pager goes off. The Sunday Times is trying to get hold of him. It's urgent. He goes to phone. Frank arrives. 'Water?' someone suggests to Frank. 'No thanks,' he cackles like a naughty old uncle at a starchy family do. 'I seldom touch it.'</p> <p>Ken returns. 'A new scandal about me,' he explains, sounding almost happy about it, now. 'A friend of mine seems to have briefed The Sunday Times that I've gone and moved my assets to Brighton so they won't be hit by the business tax I don't have the power to introduce in London,' he says in a voice congealing with sarcasm.</p> <p>He sits and removes his watch and puts it on the table in front of him, like he and the other two candidates always do. It's a hustings ritual. They follow a pattern. Speeches for so many minutes. Then questions. 'Can I say,' begins Ken, as all three candidates usually do, 'that there are actually very few differences between the three candidates...'</p> <p>Ironically, the main thing that separates Ken from Frank in these meetings is that Ken usually tries to underscore his New Labour credentials, while Frank tries to demonstrate that he is still a leftwinger. 'I've never stopped calling myself a socialist and I don't plan to now,' Frank says, bullishly.</p> <p>Today's small audience contains several party members who are candidates for the Mayoral Assembly, the body intended to scrutinise the mayor. On the previous Sunday, The Observer printed a piece in which Livingstone had described the candidates who had made it through the party's elaborate vetting process as 'not the first 11'. Some of the candidates have taken umbrage.</p> <p>'Finally,' Ken is saying, 'people seem to be slightly offended about my minor criticism of the slate we've got. I think the people we've got are fine. It's the people who weren't allowed to stand that is an absolute bloody disgrace... They ruled out anybody who might actually support me.'</p> <p>The applause he wins, even from this small crowd, is thunderous. However, a bespectacled woman is not applauding. Maggie Cosin is furious. She is a Dobson supporter, and one of the assembly candidates Livingstone described as 'not the first 11'. She stands and says loudly: 'I find your interpretation of my position quite insulting.'</p> <p>Instead of responding, Ken pointedly ignores her, staring at a copy of The Independent in front of him on his desk. The headline trumpets: 'Poll reveals Livingstone's massive lead'. It suggests Livingstone has a lead of 63 per cent of London Labour Party members over Dobson's 25 per cent.</p> <p>'I think you should withdraw your comments,' Cosin is saying. 'You'll get bitten if you don't...'</p> <p>Glenda Jackson regards Cosins dismissively. 'Oh, that's marvellous,' she laughs. 'If you disagree with them, then a member of the assembly is going to bite you.'</p> <p>The room laughs. Frank Dobson sits stock-still, a tiny, embarrassed half-smile on his face. 'Can I say,' says Frank, mollifyingly, 'that no one is more pissed off with the process than I am.' He uses the same deliberately inappropriate language at every meeting, trying to distance himself from the smooth Millbank workers who are trying to secure his victory.</p> <p>23 January. Another day, another hustings. Sunday is a Labour Party members' meeting in an Enfield school. Party workers are unsure whether the press should be allowed to attend. 'It's OK,' says Ken as he ushers me through. 'He's in bed with me,' he cackles.</p> <p>Over his shoulder, he says as he strides towards today's auditorium: 'They're becoming very paranoid about the press.' At moments like this, I wonder how far he's become enamoured of this idea: the vision of himself as the outsider. He is, however, unfailingly civil to me as I trudge around after him.</p> <p>Party members throng these meetings. They are excited by the election. Each candidate throws out new ideas for improving London's life. This is the great thing about the mayoral campaign, easily forgotten in the mess that Millbank has made of it. Londoners are going to be offered something they've been deprived of for 15 years.</p> <p>As January moves towards February, though, Livingstone's team is starting to sound less bullish. On the 25th, The Guardian runs the headline 'Victory in Livingstone's grasp, survey shows', with some more encouraging poll results. They're anxious that it will spur Dobson's team to work even harder. Besides, their own maths is showing that there's only one agonising percentage point in it.</p> <p>On 28 January, the train whisks Ken down to Stoke-sub-Hamdon in Somerset for Any Questions. 'I love it,' says Ken of the Radio 4 show. 'People throwing questions at you. Dimbleby chairs it very well, too. He doesn't let it get bogged down.'</p> <p>He performs, as always, an astonishing trick. Here he is, in the heart of rural Tory and Lib Dem territory, but the crowd adores him.</p> <p>Ken's ability to charm the enemy was learned young, he believes, at Tulse Hill Comprehensive. He explains this to me: 'Being the smallest person in a school of 2,100, I wasn't going to survive by whacking people. So I had to use my linguistic skills and my sense of humour to survive.'</p> <p>As a young child, Ken admits, he was prone to frequent temper tantrums. He gradually learned to control these as he grew older - though some observers say he is still prone to fierce moods that may explain why he has built up so few lasting alliances in the party. But publicly, his control is extraordinary.</p> <p>His is a very zoological understanding of human nature. 'Growing up is about controlling ourselves,' he believes. 'We begin as animals - animals that can kill. We discovered that with Jamie Bulger.'</p> <p>Ken's great flaw - ironically Dobson's great strength - is his inability to build political alliances. His career is full of former colleagues who have lost patience with him. However, he has the most incredible democratic talent of being able to connect directly with voters, something which Blair had assumed was his own particular skill.</p> <p>3 February. It's a dash to the Hackney Empire, where Ken gives a speech in support of the Hackney 11 - firefighters from the Homerton Station suspended for refusing to work overtime. The stalls and circle are packed with Fire Brigade Union members who have rallied in support.</p> <p>Ken takes the theatre's stage. He's popular with the FBU, having argued for years for better Fire Service funding. As mayor, responsible for setting the services budget, he announces he'd refuse to reappoint the current chief fire officer for London - the man blamed for trying to keep staff sizes down by using compulsory overtime. The cheering starts. 'I have no intention of seeing an increase in the hours worked.'</p> <p>The shouts of support are becoming louder now. Ken may be vain: most politicians are. He may be a poor party man, making two enemies for every friend, but not only can he appeal to ordinary voters, he also exudes a real faith in the process of socialism that few other politicians around him still possess. These are the sort of commitments no one has offered them in a long time. 'And if this dispute isn't sorted out, then I'll sort it out in May when I become mayor.'</p> <p>His speech is brief. He apologises, but says he's got to leave to do some campaigning. 'Because not everyone wants me to win.' But they won't let him leave the stage. The Homerton 11 want to be photographed with him, crowding around. He moves to the front and I notice how before the cameras start to click, he tucks his glasses inside his jacket pocket. One of the firemen thrusts his young baby into his arms. 'Kiss the baby!' someone shouts, and now the whole auditorium is laughing.</p> <p>7 February. In a meeting in Ealing, Ken mentions that he has heard unconfirmed reports that people have been going around asking Labour members to hand over their uncompleted ballot forms. The fear of dirty tricks is omnipresent. 'If anyone has had this happen to them, can they come and see me at the end of the meeting?'</p> <p>No one does. Instead it's the usual throng of well-wishers. Operating from as far out on a limb as he is in such a high-stakes game, it's easy to become paranoid. However, as the adage goes, just because you're paranoid...</p> <p>In July, The Sunday Times and other papers contacted him to tell him they were running a story that he had a 'secret son', an illegitimate child by another woman. The story 'had been circulated at senior levels by an anti-Livingstone faction', and a source 'close to Downing Street'. Ken threatened to sue. The Sunday Times backed off, instead printing that the story was part of a deliberate smear campaign against Ken.</p> <p>'I don't know who was running round on behalf of Downing Street telling papers I had an illegitimate child and I was behind on the maintenance payments,' he complains bitterly to one hustings meeting. 'Every day there's another person standing on my doorstep saying, we've been briefed by sources close to Downing Street...'</p> <p>Publicly, he paints Frank Dobson as a good guy who's taken some bad advice. He claims he's 100 per cent sincere when he says he'd invite him to work with him on the mayor's cabinet.</p> <p>On 8 February, Glenda Jackson's constituency polls reveal that the constituents want her to give her second vote to Ken Livingstone. She'd announced she was going to let them decide how she would vote - something which will not have endeared her to Blair. She has doggedly stuck to her own guns throughout. The tension is growing. Each vote brings the result closer, yet it's still impossible to call. The same evening, the North London Co-op announce the results of their vote. Ken has a clear 54 per cent. 'If Frank had pulled that off, he'd have won,' admits Ken. It is obvious by now that things are dangerously poised.</p> <p>The last time I see Ken before the ballot closes is the 9th, in the London Eye. The photographers go to work. 'Is The Observer going to start accusing me of taking my glasses off for photographs?' he asks me, remembering I'd suggested he might be vain about this. He keeps his glasses on. I laugh. It is very difficult not to like Ken</p> <p>It is hard to imagine what will become of Ken should he not secure the Labour Party nomination. Despite the constant press speculation, he has so frequently and publicly ruled out standing as an independent that he would certainly come over as duplicitous if he did. Besides, he has been a member of the Labour Party since 1969, and he is strongly wedded to the organisation, even if it's not the party he sometimes imagines it is.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/observer/life/story/0,3879,138575,00.html\" target_new>An eye for London [ii]</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Ken floats slowly above London, gazing out at the great city. Looking northwards, down the Thames, he suddenly blurts in a cartoonishly tremulous voice: 'One day... all this will be mine!' Then, like a guilty schoolboy caught with his hand in the lollipop jar, he adds: 'Ooops!' And he turns and looks at us and cackles loudly. It is six days before the polls close. The Labour Party will have decided which candidate should go forward to fight the mayoral election against Steven Norris. He is campaigning right up to the end. This bright winter afternoon he is here to do an interview for BBC's On the Record. He pulls the top off his Styrofoam coffee cup and takes a gulp. Tourists will not be allowed to take drinks aboard: they've bent a rule for Ken, though. But he thoughtfully tucks the cup out of sight when the TV cameras are rolling: 'If people see me with it, then they'll think anyone can,' he jokes, deliberately self-depracatingly. For the camera, he mouths a few enthusiastic if anodyne statements of the sort politicians make when talking about the internet, and tells the viewers how he's planning to use it as a tool for open government once he's mayor. It's over in a flash. 'Great,' says the TV crew. 'And now you'll cut that down to about 30 seconds,' mocks the man who would be mayor. While the crew protests, he turns back to enjoy the amazing view of the city he was born in, lived in, and was once political leader of. He has turned up alone, as he almost always does, but once inside the enormous wheel's pod, he is the centre of attention. Today, alongside the nice people from British Airways' marketing team, are two photographers, the TV crew and a journalist: me. I've been following him around for weeks, watching the final throes of this extraordinary campaign. It had begun as a joke. When John Prescott had first presented the White Paper, 'A Mayor and Assembly For London', Ken had stood up in the Commons and thanked him for 'such an exciting and radical new job opportunity'. When he launched his campaign - a year ago - the papers viewed him and his supporters as quaint, as Old Labour, stuck in the past: 'Back to the 80s as Ken rallies faithful' ran the headlines. Almost weekly, the papers announced another reason why he'd never be able to stand. Yet he survived. And as the campaign grew and the party's grass roots rebelled against the Millbank yoke, it looked, astonishingly as if Ken was the race favourite. Suddenly, he was the centre of Britain's media attention again. But the last few weeks have seen the certainty of easy victory slipping away. 'Aha!' he mugs for me and the other members of the press when his pager goes off. 'Message from base.' And he looks towards Parliament, now shrinking below us. Everybody laughs. As the pod finally descends, we approach County Hall, the GLC HQ from where he had once waged his astonishing war on Thatcherism. Now he starts to chat earnestly, like the autodidact he is, about the history of the building. 'Built during World War One,' he says. 'Cost was no objective.' He liked the place. He has never quite forgiven Portillo for masterminding its sale to the Japanese company Shirayama Shokusan at what he believes was a knock-down price. 'They were terrified that if the Labour Party got in '92, we were going to give it back to the GLC,' he says. Now he peers back towards the place where he once wielded power. 'Look.' He points the windows out to me. 'That was my old office. The fourth and fifth window,' he smiles. He remembers looking out from it at the Thames at night. 'Beautiful,' he says. To the west is St James's Park, and Buckingham Palace. 'How long,' he suddenly wonders out loud, 'before some Tory MP with binoculars announces you can see into the Queen's bedroom from up here?' Another snort of laughter fills the pod. One thing has been clear every time I have seen him on this long, bruising and often bitter campaign trail. Whatever the result, after almost a decade and a half away from the front pages, Ken Livingstone has been having the time of his life. On Wednesday, the polls finally closed. London Labour Party members, trade unions, Greater London Assembly candidates, MPs and MEPs have all now finally voted for Frank, Ken or Glenda. But so much more than a mayorship depends on the outcome. While Conservatives were coping with their own public farce, the Labour Party has seen what could have been a simple ballot turn into a convoluted struggle for the soul and future of the party: as significant a set-to as Kinnock's fight to expel Militant, or - the irony of it - Kinnock, Smith and Blair's fight to bring One-Member-One-Vote-style democracy to the party. That's the way Blair saw it, anyway, pleading for his party to step into line in a series of impassioned anti-Livingstone speeches. It has been a battle long waiting to happen: between the grass roots and the centre of New Labour. And in the middle of all this was Ken. The trainspotterish man in the rumpled grey-green suits, with the squashy-looking face and the blackboard-scraping adenoidal estuary English is still one of the most beloved and most charismatic figures in British politics, the man all the polls said most Londoners wanted - and the man New Labour clearly did not want. For Ken, spinning slowly over the city in the London Eye, this bright, white-painted new symbol of all that the city could be, this year-long battle with his own party has left him twitchy, paranoid, even. When London Eye architect David Marks asks him when the results of the poll will be announced, he explains the three-day rule (no result was to be announced for at least three days from the scrutineer receiving the ballot papers, to give time for any procedural improprieties to be reported). 'Three days where no one knows what's happening. Suspicious minds worry about all this,' he mutters. Let's rewind, and play the story again. It is mid-January, at the tail end of the 'membership lists' scandal, another of Millbank's attempts to shoot down Livingstone that largely ended up hitting the party's own foot - at first, only Blair's favoured candidate, Frank Dobson, was given access to them. Had the election been fought on the One-Man-One-Vote principle Blair had battled to put in place for the party leadership elections, Livingstone would be the mayoral candidate. However, the process Millbank chose is more complex. Grassroots London Labour Party members commanded a third of the votes; trade unions and co-ops also had a third. The remaining third belonged to London's Labour MPs, MEPs and candidates for the Greater London Assembly. It was obvious from early on that the latter third were voting almost unanimously for Blair's choice, weighting the contest heavily against Ken and Glenda Jackson. So every London party member's vote is crucial. But now Ken's small team has finally received its copy of the membership lists, and Ken spends the weekend at the Livingstone For London HQ in Hanson Street, just north of Oxford Circus, folding his newly printed campaign document 'Winning London for Labour' and stuffing it into the envelopes, addressed with the newly acquired Labour membership mailing lists. HQ is two rooms, two floors apart, in an advertising agency run by the man who used to be director of publicity for the GLC. They moved in in October. Until then, they had used Ken's assistant Simon Fletcher's home address for all their post. The campaigning team that Blair so fears is a small, ramshackle operation. I know. I've rung them frequently as the campaign grew to try and find out when the next meeting was, only to get through to a voicemail that never seems to be answered. Then, just when I was tearing my hair out, that peculiar voice would announce on my phone: 'Ken Livingstone here.' As the weekend draws to a close, Ken decides that he, Simon and his second assistant, Mark, deserve a treat. The 54-year-old politician loves to eat out. Since former editor Rosie Boycott asked him to become a restaurant reviewer for Esquire magazine ('for no reason I could conceive'), Ken's fondness for restaurants has increased. As has his waistline. His taste in wine has developed, too. Ken likes a drink. He's moved with British tastes over the years, through Chardonnay to the oaky New World wines, and now he says he's starting to fall in love with really good Riojas. Ken decides on Granita in Islington. 'With all its political significance!' he smiles. Granita was the restaurant in which Tony Blair and his cadre had planned his bid to lead the Labour Party. Tonight, he relaxes: he gets smashed. Three brandies after dinner. 'Which is a lethal mistake,' he explains to me later, as I traipse around after him. But on this night, he has fun. It turns out to be one of the last chances for them to let their hair down, because the next week is about to be the bitterest of the campaign. It starts on Monday night - the day Norris is confirmed as Tory candidate to replace the disgraced Lord Archer. Some time before the papers are finally put to bed, members of Dobson's team start receiving calls about an article that's just appeared in the new issue of The Face. Would they care to comment? Ken remembers doing the article last December. It was, he'd thought, a bit of fun. 'Tell us a joke,' the magazine's journalist had said. 'Salman Rushdie is on a train,' Ken obliged surreally, 'and it pulls into the station and he sees Yasser Arafat... he was so overcome at seeing his great hero that he rushed to embrace him...' And so on. The punchline ended: 'Never go for a Shiite while a train is in the station.' Not the most politically expedient of jokes, certainly. However, it was another off-the-cuff comment that he was about to be hung with. As mayor, how would you respond to a J18 or a Battle of Seattle-type situation? In retrospect, it was probably a mistake to answer: 'I have always been in favour of direct action. One of my fondest memories was chasing the inspector of the Archway Road inquiry out on to the roof at the Central Hall...' By Tuesday morning's papers, this idle tomfoolery has been transformed by The Daily Telegraph into 'Livingstone backs City riots as his moderate mask slips'. The article quotes Dobson and members of his team, which infuriates Livingstone. 'When the papers phoned me up when Frank was being attacked about making a joke about the Dome,' he complains, 'I said, \"I'm sure he didn't mean that. I'm sure it was just a joke.\"' Later in the day, the Evening Standard joins in with what looks like a deliberately timed attack by Labour Party member and journalist Peter Kellner: 'Why Tony fears Ken: a three-page report attacking Ken's record at the GLC'. 'What's bizarre,' sighs Ken, 'is that British editors think they can tell Londoners that their memories are false.' Nevertheless, the campaign is taking its toll. 'I am not sleeping quite as well as I should.' Sometimes, he says, he wakes at four in the morning, alert. Or he'll go to bed at two and then the phone will start ringing at six the next morning. He's looking tired. Mercifully, he has little trouble actually going to sleep. He reads a page of his book and he's gone. At the moment, he's working his way through 60s sci-fi writer Orson Scott Card's Ender Wiggins trilogy. If anything confirms his image as the super-geek, it's his love of sci-fi. He's on the second one: Speaker for the Dead. Ender is a child trained to play computer games. Unwittingly, he is actually being used to fight real space battles and wipes out an entire civilisation. Thus he becomes the most despised man in the universe, condemned to wander the universe as a pariah. 'No,' he answers my obvious question wearily. 'No parallels at all. I just think it's a very good book.' William Hill is quoting the odds on him being the first mayor of London at 5/2. His mum used to gamble every day. Ken imagines the fun she'd have indulging two of her favourite passions simultaneously by betting on her own son's career. 'It's such a shame she didn't live three more years,' he says. Ken doesn't like gambling at all. He remembers trying it once, in 1992 in California, where the lottery prize was around $50 million. He thought if he won he'd be able to solve the funding problems of the left at a stroke. When he didn't, he was resentful. 'I like winning,' he explains simply. But by the next day, the anti-Livingstone tone the press has been taking this week seems to have been raised another notch. On 19 January, the Evening Standard and The Guardian also come out with articles condemning Ken's record. The Standard 's, by Gordon Brown, is particularly damaging. Ken works on rebuttal articles for both newspapers, pledging loyalty to the party again. It is crucial to reassure the voters Tony is trying to win over: his own polling suggests he's ahead, but only by a tiny margin. 'That's the most annoying thing. It suddenly takes three or four hours out of my day.' On a typical day in the office, Mark will be updating Ken's website on the computer, and Simon will be fielding calls. Tacked on the wall is a hand-rendered rough for a press advert - obviously rejected. It reads: 'The only way Frank Dobson can become more popular than Ken Livingstone: resign.' In their second room, a trendy young woman dressed in an unofficial campaign T-shirt that depicts Ken as Che Guevara is carrying out phone polls. The unofficial T-shirts are being advertised at \u00a314 in Time Out. Another woman is stuffing envelopes with the stacks of campaign leaflets. 'Well...' she says with a smile, 'it's exciting, though, isn't it.' She is playing a part in what everyone knows must be a historic political battle. The day will get worse. In a Labour Party meeting in central London, Blair weighs into Ken. 'Think long and hard. Because if you pick the wrong candidate, you might yet regret it,' he pleads with the audience. But astonishingly, the PM is greeted by boos and heckling. He looks thrown by it. That evening at 8pm, Ken is to address Labour Party members in Wimbledon. He travels to Waterloo, gets on a small train and looks at the passengers. He notices they all seem to be reading the Evening Standard. Some are reading the first edition, with the headline 'Brown lays into Red Ken', others are reading the late edition, with the head line 'Blair's attack on Livingstone'. People look up and see who has joined them in the carriage. And, as Londoners usually do, they smile at him. In his mind, this is proof that despite the anti-Ken abuse, little is sticking. 21 January. By Friday, he is actually feeling quite bullish. 'If Frank's campaign was taking off and going smoothly, they wouldn't have done it,' he says. The next day, the Evening Standard has trailed his article on its front page: 'You've got me wrong, Tony.' Shaun Ley, the BBC political editor for London, has an appointment to meet Ken this morning at the Atrium, the restaurant on Millbank where politicians are usually thick on the ground. He's going to film an interview for BBC2's Around Westminster. Livingstone arrives, switches off the ever-present mobile phone and prepares for his interview. 'You see The Mirror today - \"Dead as a Dobbo\"?' Ley, too, notices a confidence creeping into Livingstone's answers. Today, he seems more interested in discussing the nuts and bolts of the mayoral job, the mechanics of how the mayor is going to work with the newly elected assembly. It's as if he's thinking that the battle now is Steven Norris, not the Labour Party. 'Have you heard?' Ken tells me, beaming from ear to ear. 'Norris has come out for cannabis today.' Actually, he decides, that's quite a clever move. He tells me he reckons the further he can distance himself from Hague, the better Norris's chances are. The weekend comes. On more relaxing days, Ken likes to walk in the heavily wooded area of Hampstead Heath, watching the sunlight come through the birches and the oaks. You feel completely cut off from the city there. Not that Ken would ever like to live anywhere outside London. He starts to get itchy after a week in the countryside. But he would love a house with a garden backing on to the Heath. 'Sadly,' he says, with a smirk, 'I don't think the mayoral salary will stretch to that.' In more normal times, he goes to the cinema at least once a week. 'Oh Gawd, I see loads of 'em. Last one I liked? The one about the old man riding his lawnmower.' He loves the zoo, too. He's been going there since he was a kid. One of his main campaign speech soundbites is nostalgic: about how easy it was to get around London as a kid in those days. He tempts the party and union members with the idea that London could be like that again. Ken's garden in the Cricklewood house he shares with his partner Kate is one of his favourite places. It contains an enormous pond he built there in 1990. He's stocked the pond with frogs: Rana esculenta, better known as edible frogs - not that he eats them. Quite the opposite. One day in early winter, he noticed one of the baby frogs - no bigger than a little fingernail - hadn't developed its legs fully. He took it out and put it in a goldfish bowl in the dining room. It's there still. When the last frost is done, he'll put it back in the pond and it'll be able to catch up with the others. If his house burned down and he could only save one thing he thinks he'd save that frog. It sounds a little ridiculous, he knows, 'but having put so much effort into nursing it...' he explains. It's 10.30am on Saturday morning and only a couple of dozen people have gathered for the GMB union hustings. 'Well,' says Glenda Jackson, the only candidate who has made it on time, 'it looks like you're going to just have me.' Bored, she starts singing loudly to herself. Ken arrives, looking harried. 'I'm finding the days just flash by.' He sits down next to her. By this stage, the seating arrangement for these hustings has been set: Glenda in the middle, Ken on one side and Frank on the other. Ken and Glenda have struck up a rapport during the race for the candidacy, less because they are natural political bedfellows, more because, they have both become exasperated at the way the Millbank machine has tried to run the election. Ken pulls out a sheaf of phone-message slips. Glenda raises her eyebrows. 'Are they just messages from today?' she asks, almost jealously. 'No. They're ones I couldn't get through on Thursday and Friday.' Ken's pager goes off. The Sunday Times is trying to get hold of him. It's urgent. He goes to phone. Frank arrives. 'Water?' someone suggests to Frank. 'No thanks,' he cackles like a naughty old uncle at a starchy family do. 'I seldom touch it.' Ken returns. 'A new scandal about me,' he explains, sounding almost happy about it, now. 'A friend of mine seems to have briefed The Sunday Times that I've gone and moved my assets to Brighton so they won't be hit by the business tax I don't have the power to introduce in London,' he says in a voice congealing with sarcasm. He sits and removes his watch and puts it on the table in front of him, like he and the other two candidates always do. It's a hustings ritual. They follow a pattern. Speeches for so many minutes. Then questions. 'Can I say,' begins Ken, as all three candidates usually do, 'that there are actually very few differences between the three candidates...' Ironically, the main thing that separates Ken from Frank in these meetings is that Ken usually tries to underscore his New Labour credentials, while Frank tries to demonstrate that he is still a leftwinger. 'I've never stopped calling myself a socialist and I don't plan to now,' Frank says, bullishly. Today's small audience contains several party members who are candidates for the Mayoral Assembly, the body intended to scrutinise the mayor. On the previous Sunday, The Observer printed a piece in which Livingstone had described the candidates who had made it through the party's elaborate vetting process as 'not the first 11'. Some of the candidates have taken umbrage. 'Finally,' Ken is saying, 'people seem to be slightly offended about my minor criticism of the slate we've got. I think the people we've got are fine. It's the people who weren't allowed to stand that is an absolute bloody disgrace... They ruled out anybody who might actually support me.' The applause he wins, even from this small crowd, is thunderous. However, a bespectacled woman is not applauding. Maggie Cosin is furious. She is a Dobson supporter, and one of the assembly candidates Livingstone described as 'not the first 11'. She stands and says loudly: 'I find your interpretation of my position quite insulting.' Instead of responding, Ken pointedly ignores her, staring at a copy of The Independent in front of him on his desk. The headline trumpets: 'Poll reveals Livingstone's massive lead'. It suggests Livingstone has a lead of 63 per cent of London Labour Party members over Dobson's 25 per cent. 'I think you should withdraw your comments,' Cosin is saying. 'You'll get bitten if you don't...' Glenda Jackson regards Cosins dismissively. 'Oh, that's marvellous,' she laughs. 'If you disagree with them, then a member of the assembly is going to bite you.' The room laughs. Frank Dobson sits stock-still, a tiny, embarrassed half-smile on his face. 'Can I say,' says Frank, mollifyingly, 'that no one is more pissed off with the process than I am.' He uses the same deliberately inappropriate language at every meeting, trying to distance himself from the smooth Millbank workers who are trying to secure his victory. 23 January. Another day, another hustings. Sunday is a Labour Party members' meeting in an Enfield school. Party workers are unsure whether the press should be allowed to attend. 'It's OK,' says Ken as he ushers me through. 'He's in bed with me,' he cackles. Over his shoulder, he says as he strides towards today's auditorium: 'They're becoming very paranoid about the press.' At moments like this, I wonder how far he's become enamoured of this idea: the vision of himself as the outsider. He is, however, unfailingly civil to me as I trudge around after him. Party members throng these meetings. They are excited by the election. Each candidate throws out new ideas for improving London's life. This is the great thing about the mayoral campaign, easily forgotten in the mess that Millbank has made of it. Londoners are going to be offered something they've been deprived of for 15 years. As January moves towards February, though, Livingstone's team is starting to sound less bullish. On the 25th, The Guardian runs the headline 'Victory in Livingstone's grasp, survey shows', with some more encouraging poll results. They're anxious that it will spur Dobson's team to work even harder. Besides, their own maths is showing that there's only one agonising percentage point in it. On 28 January, the train whisks Ken down to Stoke-sub-Hamdon in Somerset for Any Questions. 'I love it,' says Ken of the Radio 4 show. 'People throwing questions at you. Dimbleby chairs it very well, too. He doesn't let it get bogged down.' He performs, as always, an astonishing trick. Here he is, in the heart of rural Tory and Lib Dem territory, but the crowd adores him. Ken's ability to charm the enemy was learned young, he believes, at Tulse Hill Comprehensive. He explains this to me: 'Being the smallest person in a school of 2,100, I wasn't going to survive by whacking people. So I had to use my linguistic skills and my sense of humour to survive.' As a young child, Ken admits, he was prone to frequent temper tantrums. He gradually learned to control these as he grew older - though some observers say he is still prone to fierce moods that may explain why he has built up so few lasting alliances in the party. But publicly, his control is extraordinary. His is a very zoological understanding of human nature. 'Growing up is about controlling ourselves,' he believes. 'We begin as animals - animals that can kill. We discovered that with Jamie Bulger.' Ken's great flaw - ironically Dobson's great strength - is his inability to build political alliances. His career is full of former colleagues who have lost patience with him. However, he has the most incredible democratic talent of being able to connect directly with voters, something which Blair had assumed was his own particular skill. 3 February. It's a dash to the Hackney Empire, where Ken gives a speech in support of the Hackney 11 - firefighters from the Homerton Station suspended for refusing to work overtime. The stalls and circle are packed with Fire Brigade Union members who have rallied in support. Ken takes the theatre's stage. He's popular with the FBU, having argued for years for better Fire Service funding. As mayor, responsible for setting the services budget, he announces he'd refuse to reappoint the current chief fire officer for London - the man blamed for trying to keep staff sizes down by using compulsory overtime. The cheering starts. 'I have no intention of seeing an increase in the hours worked.' The shouts of support are becoming louder now. Ken may be vain: most politicians are. He may be a poor party man, making two enemies for every friend, but not only can he appeal to ordinary voters, he also exudes a real faith in the process of socialism that few other politicians around him still possess. These are the sort of commitments no one has offered them in a long time. 'And if this dispute isn't sorted out, then I'll sort it out in May when I become mayor.' His speech is brief. He apologises, but says he's got to leave to do some campaigning. 'Because not everyone wants me to win.' But they won't let him leave the stage. The Homerton 11 want to be photographed with him, crowding around. He moves to the front and I notice how before the cameras start to click, he tucks his glasses inside his jacket pocket. One of the firemen thrusts his young baby into his arms. 'Kiss the baby!' someone shouts, and now the whole auditorium is laughing. 7 February. In a meeting in Ealing, Ken mentions that he has heard unconfirmed reports that people have been going around asking Labour members to hand over their uncompleted ballot forms. The fear of dirty tricks is omnipresent. 'If anyone has had this happen to them, can they come and see me at the end of the meeting?' No one does. Instead it's the usual throng of well-wishers. Operating from as far out on a limb as he is in such a high-stakes game, it's easy to become paranoid. However, as the adage goes, just because you're paranoid... In July, The Sunday Times and other papers contacted him to tell him they were running a story that he had a 'secret son', an illegitimate child by another woman. The story 'had been circulated at senior levels by an anti-Livingstone faction', and a source 'close to Downing Street'. Ken threatened to sue. The Sunday Times backed off, instead printing that the story was part of a deliberate smear campaign against Ken. 'I don't know who was running round on behalf of Downing Street telling papers I had an illegitimate child and I was behind on the maintenance payments,' he complains bitterly to one hustings meeting. 'Every day there's another person standing on my doorstep saying, we've been briefed by sources close to Downing Street...' Publicly, he paints Frank Dobson as a good guy who's taken some bad advice. He claims he's 100 per cent sincere when he says he'd invite him to work with him on the mayor's cabinet. On 8 February, Glenda Jackson's constituency polls reveal that the constituents want her to give her second vote to Ken Livingstone. She'd announced she was going to let them decide how she would vote - something which will not have endeared her to Blair. She has doggedly stuck to her own guns throughout. The tension is growing. Each vote brings the result closer, yet it's still impossible to call. The same evening, the North London Co-op announce the results of their vote. Ken has a clear 54 per cent. 'If Frank had pulled that off, he'd have won,' admits Ken. It is obvious by now that things are dangerously poised. The last time I see Ken before the ballot closes is the 9th, in the London Eye. The photographers go to work. 'Is The Observer going to start accusing me of taking my glasses off for photographs?' he asks me, remembering I'd suggested he might be vain about this. He keeps his glasses on. I laugh. It is very difficult not to like Ken It is hard to imagine what will become of Ken should he not secure the Labour Party nomination. Despite the constant press speculation, he has so frequently and publicly ruled out standing as an independent that he would certainly come over as duplicitous if he did. Besides, he has been a member of the Labour Party since 1969, and he is strongly wedded to the organisation, even if it's not the party he sometimes imagines it is. An eye for London [ii]",

(Well, ideal for India, where vineyards produce two crops a year.) The French came up with a chalky site in Narayangaon, 100 miles from Bombay, in the Sahyadri Mountains. In this isolated spot, Chougule planted Chardonnay and Ugni Blanc and made Omar Khayyam, India's first sparkling wine.</p> <p>Since then, he's installed other European varieties (Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Chenin Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc and Syrah) alongside a dozen indigenous grapes (look out for the Monty Pythonesque Bangalore Purple). Ch\u00e2teau Indage now makes two million bottles a year: everything from sparkling wine to brandy, via various styles of red, white and ros\u00e9.

The one place it might succeed is in Britain's 100,000-odd Indian restaurants, where Piat d'Or and Mateus Ros\u00e9 hold sway. To this end, Cobra Beer has just launched a rather promising range of curry-friendly wines, named after a retired Indian army officer. There's only one drawback as far as India is concerned - the wines were made, not in Bangalore or Maharashtra, but in southern France.</p>",

Chougule enlisted the help of Champagne Piper-Heidsieck and went in search of the ideal climate. (Well, ideal for India, where vineyards produce two crops a year.) The French came up with a chalky site in Narayangaon, 100 miles from Bombay, in the Sahyadri Mountains. In this isolated spot, Chougule planted Chardonnay and Ugni Blanc and made Omar Khayyam, India's first sparkling wine. Since then, he's installed other European varieties (Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Chenin Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc and Syrah) alongside a dozen indigenous grapes (look out for the Monty Pythonesque Bangalore Purple). Ch\u00e2teau Indage now makes two million bottles a year: everything from sparkling wine to brandy, via various styles of red, white and ros\u00e9. The Omar Khayyam fizz and a Cabernet Sauvignon-based red called Anarkali are the most drinkable, though neither is likely to disrupt the sleep patterns of producers in Champagne and Bordeaux. Talking of which, Ch\u00e2teau Indage's main competitor, Grover Vineyards in Bangalore, has a double French connection. Michel Rolland, the Bordeaux-based consultant, is the winemaker and Champagne Veuve Clicquot a shareholder. French know-how hasn't produced particularly distinguished wines, however. The red Cabernet/Shiraz blend is the only one I'd even consider drinking. That's the problem with Indian wine as a whole. At its best it's palatable, but not much more than that. The one place it might succeed is in Britain's 100,000-odd Indian restaurants, where Piat d'Or and Mateus Ros\u00e9 hold sway. To this end, Cobra Beer has just launched a rather promising range of curry-friendly wines, named after a retired Indian army officer. There's only one drawback as far as India is concerned - the wines were made, not in Bangalore or Maharashtra, but in southern France.",

      "body": "<p>Last week, I saw a lady who felt completely distraught about her size. Unlike many people at this time of the year who are paying the penalty for having an extravagant Christmas, her increase in dress size was purely down to fluid retention: she could wake up more than six pounds heavier, with painfully swollen fingers and unable to squeeze into her clothes and shoes, having indulged in nothing more than sleep.</p> <p>Fluid retention - otherwise known as oedema - can be a symptom of many conditions, such as heart failure or kidney disease, which is why you should see your GP before pursuing a self-help programme. However, more often than not, there will be no apparent cause - for some reason, the body starts retaining fluid, in which case the diagnosis is idiopathic (of no known cause) oedema. It can be most noticeable at certain times of the month - usually around the pre-menstrual time - or you can feel more 'fluidy' at either end of the day; most typically when you've been standing a lot. A similar type of condition can occur on long journeys, particularly in aeroplanes, when sitting for long periods of time without exercising. Stress can even cause the body to become oedematous.</p> <p>One of the most common causes and aggravators of oedema is excess retention of salt. The body hates high sodium-chloride levels, so it tries to dilute the concentration of this compound in the tissues by holding on to water. Therefore, one of the most effective ways to treat oedema is to reduce the body's sodium levels, which can be achieved by restricting sodium chloride/salt intake. Unfortunately, many doctors don't look to this avenue of treatment, they are more likely to prescribe drugs which are diuretic, such as Frumil, and cause the body to lose both salt and the water along with it. But these drugs have a few downsides - they can cause side effects such as tiredness and dizziness and in extreme, but not uncommon circumstances, they can cause the body to overshoot on its fluid shift: it loses far too much water, the blood pressure drops and you faint. They can also stimulate a counterproductive hormone reaction - the renin angiotensin mechanism - which actually causes the body to retain water. If the renin angiotensin system is provoked, the kidney starts to retain salt, and oedema occurs.</p> <p>Worse still, you can experience a real backlash when you stop taking the drugs, as the kidneys have a tendency to overexaggerate their response to the lack of diuretic and retain more salt than they need. Fluid retention then escalates, frequently to a much worse-extent than it was before diuretics were taken. Having said this, such a dramatic response is only usual when the diuretics are stopped suddenly - so if you're advised to stop taking diuretics, reduce them slowly, rather than stopping instantaneously. However, in some cases taking diuretics is unavoidable.</p> <p>The most effective way to reduce fluid retention is to look to the salt and potassium content of the diet. The relationship between these two minerals is balanced rather like a pair of scales - if salt levels are high, then potassium will be low, but if potassium levels are high, then the salt level will be minimum. This means that if you boost your potassium intake, the body will keep its sodium low, and therefore reduce oedema. Potassium-rich foods include most fruits and vegetables, especially bananas and tomatoes, along with dried fruits and fresh juices. Avoid taking potassium supplements, unless they have been prescribed by your GP, as they can have serious side effects.</p> <p>As a nation, we should all be increasing our potassium and cutting down on our salt intakes, especially as excess salt causes, or aggravates, several serious health problems including blood pressure, bone loss, kidney disease, heart disease and certain types of cancers, particularly those of the stomach. The most obvious way to decrease sodium levels is to stop adding salt to food, both at the table and in cooking. Frequently, adding salt is a habit, rather than being connected to taste - it's just a question of weaning your taste buds off it.</p> <p>So sample your food before reaching for the salt cellar - you'll be surprised how much flavour food has on its own. You may also find more subtle flavours which have been annihilated when doused by the salt pot. To increase taste, look to other ingredients such as herbs, wine, garlic or ginger. Note that sea salt, rock salt and table salt all contain virtually the same quantities of sodium chloride - each is as fluid-retaining as the other. Lo-salt is based around potassium, so this can be suitable to use in cooking, although some might feel it's a poor substitute.</p> <p>You may think that simply cutting out the salt you add to your food will reduce your salt intake sufficiently, but this is only half the battle. Between 70 to 80 per cent of our salt intake is hidden in processed foods. It's obvious in salty foods such as pickled herring, anchovies, kippers, other smoked fish, olives and cured meats, but other foods, such as bread and breakfast cereals, can contain astonishingly high sodium-chloride levels - cornflakes, for example, have a much higher salt concentration than the Atlantic Ocean.</p> <p>In most cases of fluid retention, simply cutting down on the blatantly salty foods and refraining from adding salt can alleviate the problem, but occasionally it's also necessary to watch the intake of processed foods. The problem with deciphering salt levels in processed foods is that sometimes the word 'salt' is not mentioned on food labels - it's most likely to be listed as sodium. To convert the sodium content into sodium chloride (salt), you need to multiply the sodium value by 2.5 - so 1g sodium is equivalent to 2.5g salt.</p> <p>One should try to eat as little processed foods as possible, because the majority of foods need salt to enhance flavours that may have been lost during processing: they contain far in excess of the recommended 6g of salt per day. For example, a 250g ready-made meal which contains 1g sodium per 100g, actually contains 6.25g salt. In just one meal, you've eaten your daily salt quotient - see how easy it is, before you've even started adding salt to foods.</p> <p>As well as looking to the food we eat, it also helps to keep caffeine and alcohol intakes down, as these both aggravate fluid retention. Water, on the other hand, can help decrease idiopathic oedema in the majority of cases, as it helps dilute the body's salt levels. Exercise can also help the body shift excess fluid by maximising the circulatory and tissue-drainage systems - so keeping mobile, even simply flexing your calf muscles while sitting on a plane, or at a desk, can help reduce the puffiness.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Nigel Pease is a man with problems. His new house is a travesty of the most basic design principles. The entrance hall has been wallpapered randomly with contrasting prints, his tiny bedroom has no windows or electric light, and there's a kind of baroque wooden screen around his bathroom, which has no interior door. It can only be reached by a dark passageway carpeted entirely with grass. Just walking down it makes Nigel feel depressed.</p> <p>As if that wasn't bad enough, on the day he moved in, the neighbours dropped by to say hello... A tall, glamorous woman in a red dress was chatty at first, but when Nigel unaccountably tried to tickle her, she slapped him. His next visitor, a man in a suit, warmed immediately to Nigel's friendly advances, and their conversation continued into the bathroom. The neighbour felt so much at ease that he sat down and relieved himself in Nigel's presence. Nigel asked him to leave.</p> <p>With no job, no money and no friends, Nigel could really do with a little guidance. Simply pointing him towards the newspaper might help. He might find a job. And with a bit of cash coming in, he could at least feed himself, maybe even get a floor down on that bathroom passage. The thousand-mile journey begins with a single step and all that. Nigel just needs to know where to start. What Nigel never needs to know is that the tickling incident was your idea, ditto the grass corridor. The neighbour's dump, however, had nothing to do with you.</p> <p>Nigel is a character I created in a revolutionary new computer game. The Sims is not really like anything that's gone before it, partly because you don't simply roam around looking for things to kill, mainly because it's a simulation of real life. You create a family, build them a home to live in, then furnish it - buy them beds, a fridge, a colour TV. It can be a one-person family, like Nigel's, or a screaming horde. It's up to you. You choose their bodies and clothes, name them, give them their basic personality traits, and they... just get on with their lives. If they're hungry, they might fix themselves a snack; if they feel grubby, they might take a bath; if they own a music centre, they might have a bit of a dance. The Sims is a doll's house with living dolls.</p> <p>But Simville wasn't built in a day. The game has taken eight years to perfect. It's the creation of Will Wright, who previously made the super-addictive SimCity, in which you build whole cities - minus little people - from the ground up. SimCity sold multimillions worldwide, but rockstar-like success hasn't added any rockstar trimmings to Wright. He is spectacularly nerdy.

      "bodyText": "Nigel Pease is a man with problems. His new house is a travesty of the most basic design principles. The entrance hall has been wallpapered randomly with contrasting prints, his tiny bedroom has no windows or electric light, and there's a kind of baroque wooden screen around his bathroom, which has no interior door. It can only be reached by a dark passageway carpeted entirely with grass. Just walking down it makes Nigel feel depressed. As if that wasn't bad enough, on the day he moved in, the neighbours dropped by to say hello... A tall, glamorous woman in a red dress was chatty at first, but when Nigel unaccountably tried to tickle her, she slapped him. His next visitor, a man in a suit, warmed immediately to Nigel's friendly advances, and their conversation continued into the bathroom. The neighbour felt so much at ease that he sat down and relieved himself in Nigel's presence. Nigel asked him to leave. With no job, no money and no friends, Nigel could really do with a little guidance. Simply pointing him towards the newspaper might help. He might find a job. And with a bit of cash coming in, he could at least feed himself, maybe even get a floor down on that bathroom passage. The thousand-mile journey begins with a single step and all that. Nigel just needs to know where to start. What Nigel never needs to know is that the tickling incident was your idea, ditto the grass corridor. The neighbour's dump, however, had nothing to do with you. Nigel is a character I created in a revolutionary new computer game. The Sims is not really like anything that's gone before it, partly because you don't simply roam around looking for things to kill, mainly because it's a simulation of real life. You create a family, build them a home to live in, then furnish it - buy them beds, a fridge, a colour TV. It can be a one-person family, like Nigel's, or a screaming horde. It's up to you. You choose their bodies and clothes, name them, give them their basic personality traits, and they... just get on with their lives. If they're hungry, they might fix themselves a snack; if they feel grubby, they might take a bath; if they own a music centre, they might have a bit of a dance. The Sims is a doll's house with living dolls. But Simville wasn't built in a day. The game has taken eight years to perfect. It's the creation of Will Wright, who previously made the super-addictive SimCity, in which you build whole cities - minus little people - from the ground up. SimCity sold multimillions worldwide, but rockstar-like success hasn't added any rockstar trimmings to Wright. He is spectacularly nerdy. When we meet, he is wearing black slacks and a maroon open-necked shirt; he sports a pudding-bowl haircut, square black specs. He says things like: 'I don't think people realise how much tactical and strategic forethought goes into their daily lives.' Will Wright is the \u00fcbergeek. 'We tried to approach reality by getting as close to it as possible,' says Wright, 'but at a certain point, we had to stop trying to get any closer. Some elements of life we had to throw out. There is no paedophilia in the game, no heavy domestic violence. Children can hit each other, but parents can't hit children and children can't hit parents.' The Sims is more than just a game of happy families, however. Characters can have fights, affairs - even same-sex affairs; there can be gay couples with children.

A visit to the dentist no longer needs to be the stressful, painful, uncomfortable ordeal of the past. Dentists today are using soft background music, stimulating art, soothing aromatherapy oils and calming design to make surgeries relaxing and inviting. Modern methods and equipment are making treatment virtually painless, while state-of-the-art technology can in some cases completely replace the needle and the drill. Twenty-first century dentistry is fast becoming stress-free, pain-free and an altogether more pleasurable experience.</p> <p>The trend is aimed partly at enticing back into the chair those people put off by unpleasant memories of past visits. According to the British Dental Association (BDA), only half of us regularly attend a dentist, and one third go only when in pain. One in 10 are actually phobic. Unfortunately, while most dentists are moving towards more patient-friendly environments, much of the newest technology is confined to private practice. For NHS patients - that's most of us - the cost of such treatment is simply prohibitive.</p> <p>Stepping out of London's busy Knightsbridge into the Lund Osler dental practice is more like walking into a health club than the traditional dentist's waiting-room. Behind the glass fa\u00e7ade, softly lit pastel-coloured walls lend a calm atmosphere. Owner Surinder Hundle, one of the practice's two dentists, commissioned designers to create exactly the minimalist effect he desired. 'From the moment they walk in, the environment is very relaxed,' he explains.</p> <p>Patients may bring in their own CDs or videos for distraction during appointments. Alternatively, they can enjoy a guided tour of their own teeth on a TV monitor, linked to a camera small enough to fit in the patient's mouth. Digital X-rays, which use up to 90 per cent less radiation than traditional machines, highlight decay. Treatment involves the latest technology to minimise noise, stress and pain.</p> <p>Air abrasion - firing a stream of minute aluminium oxide particles to cut away decay - is one of the newest innovations. As well as replacing the drill, it removes the need for local anaesthetic since the process is totally painless. 'Patients love it,' says Dr Hundle (all dentists are now entitled to style themselves doctor). 'It basically does away with all the anxiety of having an injection or the drill.'</p> <p>Alternatively, or sometimes together, he uses Carisolv, a gel which dissolves decay. Neither of these, however, are effective on old fillings or large areas of decay. Such treatments do not come cheap. A consultation using all the new gadgetry starts at \u00a385, false-teeth implants cost from \u00a3300 and crowns from \u00a3350.</p> <p>At the Lloyd Jerome practice in Glasgow, art is the medium used to soothe patients. Owner and dentist Dr Jerome included an art gallery when he opened the practice five years ago. The gallery doubles as the surgery waiting-room. Aromatherapy oils help relax visitors. 'In a really calm, relaxing environment most of what seems very scary stops being scary,' says Dr Jerome. He too uses the latest technology, including virtual-reality headsets. Before using the needle, he numbs the patient's gum with anaesthetic paste and always waits long enough for the injection to take effect. 'The main factor that stops dentistry being painless is haste,' says Dr Jerome, whose practice is purely private.</p> <p>Not far away, the Edinburgh Dental Institute has made art integral to its design. When the dental hospital moved to the premises next to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary in 1997, managers commissioned four international artists to design the building around a dental theme. The results include a wall of glass blocks each containing a vial of mercury, a pinball game pitching Toothbrush Thistle against False Teeth United and constellations of stars made from optic fibres above each dental chair.</p> <p>When even these efforts fail to soothe troubled nerves, dentists are resorting to more unusual methods to calm patients. Dr Martin Fallowfield, another private dentist, based in Peterborough, specialises in treating phobic patients. He uses various techniques to reduce discomfort, including Syrijet, a tool imported from the US, which blasts anaesthetic through the skin at high speed, as an alternative to injections. But if that does not work he uses hypnosis.</p> <p>Dr Neil Chappell, in Halstead, Essex, is one of very few dentists who offers any of these innovations on the NHS. He has been using air abrasion on both NHS and private patients for about a year. But Carisolv, which he also uses, is available only privately because it takes longer to work than a drill - time which is not recompensed in NHS fees.</p> <p>Now, high-street chains, such as Boots, are also entering the market, with plans to open more than 50 dental surgeries in stores this year and next. Aimed at people who rarely visit a dentist, the Boots practices will offer new technologies, such as anaesthetic gel and Carisolv, priced above NHS fees but below most private dentists. The NHS is also targeting reluctant patients with recently opened 'phone and go' centres for people not currently registered.</p> <p>But why should the most modern dental practice be available only at a price? John Renshaw, chair of the BDA, blames the government. Reduced fees for NHS dental work in 1992 prompted an exodus of dentists into private practice and a rise in private treatment from about eight per cent then to an estimated 35 per cent today, he says. Appeals to the government this year for new technology grants to NHS dentists were refused.</p> <p>'What we don't want to see is a very basic NHS service and anything decent or leading-edge or new or fancy being limited to the private sector,' says Renshaw. But unless the government invests more in NHS dentistry, he warns, the gap between the two services can only open wider.</p> <p>\u0095 You can find details of NHS and private dentists on the BDA's directory at <a href=\"http://www.bda-dentistry.org.uk/fad2/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.bda-dentistry.org.uk/fad2/</a></p>",

It commissioned the Gallup Organisation to investigate attitudes towards chips, and the results were assessed by psychologist Mavis Klein. Lovers of home-made chips (gourmets) were found to be monogamous, well-organised individuals, prone to guilt, sexually passionate and 'quite partial to a bit of S&amp;M', whereas low-fat or restrained chip eaters (resistors) were responsible, calm people, scared of rejection and intimacy, who enjoyed one-night stands.</p> <p>Klein's findings will be published tomorrow as part of National Chip Week.

One woman who has mastered the art is Jean Ritson, owner of Bizzie Lizzies (36 Swadford Street, Skipton, North Yorkshire; 01756 793 189). She won the 1999 Fish and Chip Shop of the Year award. 'The key to crisp but fluffy chips is proper blanching and good beef dripping,' she explains. 'We cut traditional-sized, thickish chips and soak them in water to get rid of excess starch. They are then dried and deep-fried [blanched] in dripping at 165 C until they are just soft but not coloured. You must let them stand and cool for 10 to 30 minutes before refrying them at 190 C until they are crisp and golden.' Old or dirty, unstrained fat is a prime reason for bad chips.

'For me, a chip must taste of the potato,' he says, 'so it shouldn't be too crisp and empty in the middle.' Unlike Jean Ritson, he blanches his chips at 150 C in vegetable oil, before frying them later at 200 C. Crisp, sweet and golden, they are accompanied by Sarson's vinegar, tomato ketchup and salt. 'I have to admit that I also love the soggy chips from the shop next door,' he states, before cautiously qualifying, 'but I always eat them with one of my own eggs.' I wonder if he adds his ketchup in splodges?

Unlike Jean Ritson, he blanches his chips at 150 C in vegetable oil, before frying them later at 200 C. Crisp, sweet and golden, they are accompanied by Sarson's vinegar, tomato ketchup and salt. 'I have to admit that I also love the soggy chips from the shop next door,' he states, before cautiously qualifying, 'but I always eat them with one of my own eggs.' I wonder if he adds his ketchup in splodges? Research for Heinz suggests that this indicates hard-working types, while neat dippers are cautious and persistent. \u0095 National Chip Week runs from 21-27 February.

      "body": "<p> It's the middle of January, the sun has just come out and a watery light is doing its best to warm up the Fortezza da Basso, an old fortress in the middle of Florence that is used to stage the biannual fashion shows here. Inside, however - this being the world of international fashion - there's no sign of spring, still less summer, because the buyers, designers, press and TV crews, have their minds firmly set on autumn/winter 2000. </p> <p>There are nearly 300 labels here and, of course, a strict hierarchy applies. Will you be front row for the shows, in which case you must arrive just as it's about to begin, or will you just be standing? Do you visit Versace, Moschino, Paul Smith, or will it be the no-name brands you've never heard of? Some stands are walled up, and if they don't know you personally, you won't be let in. It's well known that high-street chains come to these events precisely to spy - sorry, be inspired by - the leading designers, only - curiously enough- to come up with something very similar six months later. </p> <p>So far, so AbFab. The thing is, though, that this is not womenswear, nor even menswear, but childrenswear, which has been big business throughout Europe for some time, and is now, finally, starting to boom in Britain. </p> <p> Not that long ago, in a land not very far away, children were never heard, and seen only occasionally. If they were posh, they wore frilly little velvet and lace numbers or for boys a decent bit of tweed. If not, it was cotton flowery dresses, sweaters with bunnies sewn on and lots of shockingly bright pink. Children were the land that fashion forgot. </p> <p>Back then - oh, all of five years ago - the idea of designers of the stature of Clements Ribeiro, Jasper Conran, Elspeth Gibson, and Katharine Hamnett designing for children seemed fanciful. Yet today, all these and more (Hamnett's first collection outside Japan is launched in the autumn) are not just doing children's collections, but thriving on them. Even Gucci is set to enter the sector, when it launches its own range. </p> <p>Suzanne Clements, one half of the design duo Clements Ribeiro, says they had been considering doing childrenswear for a while, but it was the birth of her son that threw it into focus. 'Before I had Hector, I didn't give a damn about children's clothes,' she says, 'but since I've had him, there seems to be designer childrenswear everywhere.' </p> <p>It is difficult to overstate how much the industry has changed in the past five years - from one dominated by uninspired, uninteresting clothing, all cheap polycotton prints, stiff, formal party dresses and cutesy, over-decorated toddlerwear, to one affected by fashion trends almost as much as the adult ranges. </p> <p>Take combat trousers, a fashion trend that refuses to go away. A few years ago, it would have bypassed children completely, despite its obvious relevance - as a fashion, it makes a lot more sense for an eight-year-old boy (or girl), with a love of collecting things and carrying their world around with them, than it does for a 25-year- old advertising executive. Within six months of combats hitting the adult fashion scene, they had taken over children's fashion to the extent that there is not a major retailer which does not have rails of them in store. </p> <p>Last year, the dominant colours were greys, earth tones and winter whites, again following on from adult trends. Go to the childrenswear shows in Florence or Brussels and you will see as much direction there, as many clear new trends, as you will on the catwalks of Milan, Paris or London. </p> <p> Why is this happening now? In 1971, when many of today's parents were in the middle of their own childhoods, the average age of a mother when she had her first child was under 24. Today it's over 29, so that by the time most of us become parents we've got more money, and we are more established in our homes, careers and relationships. We're also at the stage when we've had a decade of partying, holidaying and - crucially - spending money on clothes for ourselves. </p> <p>Having a child is no longer the abrupt end to our lives it may have seemed in our early twenties. In our thirties, it's the beginning of our new lives, and we want to enjoy our children, spend money on them, celebrate them. We also want them to look as though they are our children, and not some extra imported from a BBC costume drama. </p> <p>David Keyte, who runs one of the best children's fashion shops in the country, Obi in Nottingham, used to work for Paul Smith in the early days of the menswear revolution. He opened his shop four years ago, just as the changes were really starting to take hold. </p> <p>'We saw an opportunity that kids could be fashionable, that there could be stylish children's clothing and, although the market has changed more slowly than perhaps we thought, I don't see many parents wanting to go out and buy traditional childrenswear.' </p> <p>Eva Karayiannis, owner of new children's shop Caramel in London's chic Brompton Cross area, agrees. The shop opened last September and has been doing a roaring trade since then. It's even had such hot items as ponyskin clogs made by the same people who made those must-have Marni clogs. </p> <p>'I thought it was crazy to dress children as if they were from another century,' says Karayiannis. 'They should be able to dress in clothes that are right for the life they lead today. In this area we're lucky enough to have some wonderful shops [the area is home to Joseph, Paul Smith, Voyage, Agn\u00e8s b] and that means the mothers like to dress their children like that, too.' </p> <p>Cue lots of articles about designer children and babies as fashion accessories, illustrated by pics of young celebrity mums with Bill Amberg baby carriers. But features such as these betray a complete lack of understanding of what it is to be a parent today - the juggling, the compromises, the pride and the pleasure. Becoming a parent is most definitely not about fashion, unless you consider a stain of posset on your shoulder to be the latest look. But it also isn't about giving up our interest in how we, and our children, look. It doesn't mean we don't - or shouldn't - care about how our children dress. </p> <p>'I don't think children will ever be a fashion accessory,' says Obi's David Keyte. 'I think people have children because they want children. But when they have children they want to put their kids in nice things. They're not suddenly going to get into flowery dresses. And, nowadays, by the time kids are eight or nine, they want to choose nice items for themselves.' </p> <p>Just how quickly the market has grown can be demonstrated by the Boden story. Started as a menswear-basics mail-order catalogue - mostly fleeces and sweatshirts - Boden took off when it began its childrenswear catalogue, Mini Boden. Just three years later, the children's catalogue is responsible for 40 per cent of the company's business, with over 100,000 customers. </p> <p>The other factor driving children's fashion is the fact that today's parents - or at least those who appeal to the ad agencies and marketing departments - are in general aged between 28 and 43. Ten years ago, they were aged between 18 and 33 and were the same bunch of fashion-aware, media literates who drove the style press, youth TV, fashion and PR businesses, and are now often in key positions in their chosen careers. </p> <p>Hence, not just the rise in children's designer fashion, but also child-friendly holidays, child-friendly restaurants, child-friendly accessories, and child-friendly politics (it's no coincidence that Labour have concentrated so heavily on early and primary education and childcare). </p> <p>This was also the generation responsible for the menswear revolution, which, within the space of five years, made it acceptable for men to care about the way they look. The link to menswear is an important one, with many believing that the children's fashion industry is in a similar position to the men's market 10 or 15 years ago. Belle Goode, who designs and runs Jigsaw Junior, Jigsaw's successful childrenswear offshoot, says: 'In the mid- to late-80s, there was a huge rise in men's fashion, and I think these days men are generally aware of the way they look. The same thing has happened for children, in part because how children look reflects on their parents.' </p> <p>Back in the 80s, it was Next that provided the big shift in menswear, that said to ordinary men that it was OK to care about what you wore, that suits didn't have to last until they wore out. Today, Gap is performing a similar role in the childrenswear market, and it is impossible to underestimate the change it is effecting on the whole sector. By investing in prime sites, by constantly revamping its collections, not just twice a year, but every six weeks, and by producing not just well-made goods but ones that are fashionable (it had the hippie bohemian look last summer before anyone else), it is raising the standard that parents expect from childrenswear shops. </p> <p>In the middle market, it is forcing all the stores to reassess their offerings, with store and range revamps from H&amp;M, and completely new and fashionable collections from Marks &amp; Spencer, including a nursery range that includes an exclusive Land Rover all-terrain pushchair (in black!) that will sell and sell. At the bottom end, they have showed up the paucity of the offerings from such stalwarts as C&amp;A and the near-terminal Mothercare, which has attempted its own revamp, even buying in mid-market designer labels in some stores. </p> <p>And at the top end it is providing a solid base, just as Next did, on which the top levels can grow and flourish. As Suzanne Clements, who admits to having some babyGap in her son's wardrobe, says: 'When I take Hector to playgroup, I see children dressed in head-to-toe Gap, often in the same outfit, and you want something different, something that looks fresh.' In her case, it's easy. She and her partner Inacio Ribeiro travel the world on business, usually taking young Hector with them and, as a result, Hector's wardrobe comes from all over the world - Japan, the Punjab, Brazil, and, of course, the couple's own acclaimed baby collection in cashmere. </p> <p>Menswear pioneer Paul Smith was again one of the first into this new market, introducing Paul Smith for Children in 1990. It was, he says, a direct response to his customers who had begun to enter their thirties and parenthood. 'Initially, it was developed as a boys' collection,' he says, 'as so many of our customers had been asking for it. It did really well, so when we launched Paul Smith Women I added girlswear to the range, too.' </p> <p>The range has now been broadened further, with some made-to-measure items at the Westbourne House flagship store in London's Notting Hill. The shop also features a purpose-built playroom and a splitting of the range into three distinct labels for autumn/winter 2000 - Paul Smith Sport, Paul Smith for Children and Paul Smith Blue Label. </p> <p>Astute as ever, Smith's timing has been impeccable, and there is generally a well-placed understanding of what is needed for visually strong outfits that are also wearable and child-appropriate. Although the range is quite separate from the men's and women's collections, there is a definite link between it and the two adult lines. 'Some of the key pieces from my mainline collections are scaled down to fit a little person,' he says, 'such as our menswear jacket complete with contrast-colour top-stitching and a bright patchwork lining.' </p> <p>Smith was also one of the first to spot the mass-market potential of designer childrenswear, with Freemans mail-order catalogue carrying his children's T-shirts. He's not the last, though. In June 1998, the Top Shop-to-Burton group Arcadia bought the Liverpool-based group Wade Smith for \u00a315.8m, announcing that it saw growth potential in catering for the demand for designer childrenswear among the not- so-middle classes. </p> <p>The store heavily features the big name brands, such as Ralph Lauren, Armani, DKNY, Calvin Klein, YSL and Ted Baker, and marks out the north-west along with Essex as one of the birthplaces of designer childrenswear for the less affluent. It was in these two areas that designer menswear really took hold, and so it's not surprising to see the same labels - Armani, CP Company, Replay and Paul Smith - walking out of childrenswear stores by the taxi-full. </p> <p> The latest to move in on the childrenswear market has been Debenhams, which has extended its Designers at Debenhams range into childrenswear, first with Jasper Conran, with baby and boyswear at Christmas, and just a couple of weeks ago, with the Sweet pea girlswear collection from the acclaimed British designer, Elspeth Gibson. </p> <p>Gibson, one of this country's hottest talents and the New Generation Designer of the Year 1998, had never designed childrenswear before, but says she had great fun designing the collection, which ranges from ages three to eight, despite not having children of her own. 'I wanted to do something a little bit special,' she says, 'but I also wanted it to be fun and easy-going. </p> <p>Now, Gibson is expecting her first child, a little girl in May, and has already designed the autumn/winter 2000 collection. Her summer collection is, apparently, selling like hot cakes, with the first items gaining repeat orders from the stores just a week after going on sale. Like the Jasper Conran boyswear, the range is very affordable (from \u00a36 to \u00a326) and, following on from her own womenswear collection, mixes traditional femininity with a modern sensibility. </p> <p>But it's not all plain sailing. With one or two exceptions, there's still - comparatively - a lack of good boyswear, and there have been casualties. The fact is, the market is, and will always be, small compared with womenswear and menswear, if only because prices are lower (and this despite the fact that the costs are not necessarily that different - although fabric costs may be cheaper, the manufacturing costs for childrenswear may be as high as womenswear, and design costs possibly higher, due to the various safety regulations that apply). Dries van Noten, for example, had to give up doing his childrenswear collection, possibly the most exquisite in the world, when work pressures caused him to choose between that or the vastly more profitable menswear. </p> <p> But the days of the pink frilly dress and the tweed jacket have gone forever. At least that's what I thought until I went to the childrenswear shows in Florence last month to see the autumn/winter 2000 collections and saw... bright pink and tweed everywhere. But that's fashion for you. </p> <p>\u0095 Chris Taggart is editor-in-chief of the upmarket parenting magazine Junior, the March/April issue of which has just been published.

'Before I had Hector, I didn't give a damn about children's clothes,' she says, 'but since I've had him, there seems to be designer childrenswear everywhere.' It is difficult to overstate how much the industry has changed in the past five years - from one dominated by uninspired, uninteresting clothing, all cheap polycotton prints, stiff, formal party dresses and cutesy, over-decorated toddlerwear, to one affected by fashion trends almost as much as the adult ranges. Take combat trousers, a fashion trend that refuses to go away. A few years ago, it would have bypassed children completely, despite its obvious relevance - as a fashion, it makes a lot more sense for an eight-year-old boy (or girl), with a love of collecting things and carrying their world around with them, than it does for a 25-year- old advertising executive. Within six months of combats hitting the adult fashion scene, they had taken over children's fashion to the extent that there is not a major retailer which does not have rails of them in store. Last year, the dominant colours were greys, earth tones and winter whites, again following on from adult trends. Go to the childrenswear shows in Florence or Brussels and you will see as much direction there, as many clear new trends, as you will on the catwalks of Milan, Paris or London. Why is this happening now? In 1971, when many of today's parents were in the middle of their own childhoods, the average age of a mother when she had her first child was under 24. Today it's over 29, so that by the time most of us become parents we've got more money, and we are more established in our homes, careers and relationships. We're also at the stage when we've had a decade of partying, holidaying and - crucially - spending money on clothes for ourselves. Having a child is no longer the abrupt end to our lives it may have seemed in our early twenties. In our thirties, it's the beginning of our new lives, and we want to enjoy our children, spend money on them, celebrate them. We also want them to look as though they are our children, and not some extra imported from a BBC costume drama. David Keyte, who runs one of the best children's fashion shops in the country, Obi in Nottingham, used to work for Paul Smith in the early days of the menswear revolution. He opened his shop four years ago, just as the changes were really starting to take hold. 'We saw an opportunity that kids could be fashionable, that there could be stylish children's clothing and, although the market has changed more slowly than perhaps we thought, I don't see many parents wanting to go out and buy traditional childrenswear.' Eva Karayiannis, owner of new children's shop Caramel in London's chic Brompton Cross area, agrees. The shop opened last September and has been doing a roaring trade since then. It's even had such hot items as ponyskin clogs made by the same people who made those must-have Marni clogs. 'I thought it was crazy to dress children as if they were from another century,' says Karayiannis. 'They should be able to dress in clothes that are right for the life they lead today. In this area we're lucky enough to have some wonderful shops [the area is home to Joseph, Paul Smith, Voyage, Agn\u00e8s b] and that means the mothers like to dress their children like that, too.' Cue lots of articles about designer children and babies as fashion accessories, illustrated by pics of young celebrity mums with Bill Amberg baby carriers. But features such as these betray a complete lack of understanding of what it is to be a parent today - the juggling, the compromises, the pride and the pleasure. Becoming a parent is most definitely not about fashion, unless you consider a stain of posset on your shoulder to be the latest look. But it also isn't about giving up our interest in how we, and our children, look. It doesn't mean we don't - or shouldn't - care about how our children dress. 'I don't think children will ever be a fashion accessory,' says Obi's David Keyte. 'I think people have children because they want children. But when they have children they want to put their kids in nice things. They're not suddenly going to get into flowery dresses. And, nowadays, by the time kids are eight or nine, they want to choose nice items for themselves.' Just how quickly the market has grown can be demonstrated by the Boden story. Started as a menswear-basics mail-order catalogue - mostly fleeces and sweatshirts - Boden took off when it began its childrenswear catalogue, Mini Boden. Just three years later, the children's catalogue is responsible for 40 per cent of the company's business, with over 100,000 customers. The other factor driving children's fashion is the fact that today's parents - or at least those who appeal to the ad agencies and marketing departments - are in general aged between 28 and 43. Ten years ago, they were aged between 18 and 33 and were the same bunch of fashion-aware, media literates who drove the style press, youth TV, fashion and PR businesses, and are now often in key positions in their chosen careers. Hence, not just the rise in children's designer fashion, but also child-friendly holidays, child-friendly restaurants, child-friendly accessories, and child-friendly politics (it's no coincidence that Labour have concentrated so heavily on early and primary education and childcare). This was also the generation responsible for the menswear revolution, which, within the space of five years, made it acceptable for men to care about the way they look. The link to menswear is an important one, with many believing that the children's fashion industry is in a similar position to the men's market 10 or 15 years ago. Belle Goode, who designs and runs Jigsaw Junior, Jigsaw's successful childrenswear offshoot, says: 'In the mid- to late-80s, there was a huge rise in men's fashion, and I think these days men are generally aware of the way they look. The same thing has happened for children, in part because how children look reflects on their parents.' Back in the 80s, it was Next that provided the big shift in menswear, that said to ordinary men that it was OK to care about what you wore, that suits didn't have to last until they wore out. Today, Gap is performing a similar role in the childrenswear market, and it is impossible to underestimate the change it is effecting on the whole sector. By investing in prime sites, by constantly revamping its collections, not just twice a year, but every six weeks, and by producing not just well-made goods but ones that are fashionable (it had the hippie bohemian look last summer before anyone else), it is raising the standard that parents expect from childrenswear shops. In the middle market, it is forcing all the stores to reassess their offerings, with store and range revamps from H&amp;M, and completely new and fashionable collections from Marks &amp; Spencer, including a nursery range that includes an exclusive Land Rover all-terrain pushchair (in black!) that will sell and sell. At the bottom end, they have showed up the paucity of the offerings from such stalwarts as C&amp;A and the near-terminal Mothercare, which has attempted its own revamp, even buying in mid-market designer labels in some stores. And at the top end it is providing a solid base, just as Next did, on which the top levels can grow and flourish. As Suzanne Clements, who admits to having some babyGap in her son's wardrobe, says: 'When I take Hector to playgroup, I see children dressed in head-to-toe Gap, often in the same outfit, and you want something different, something that looks fresh.' In her case, it's easy. She and her partner Inacio Ribeiro travel the world on business, usually taking young Hector with them and, as a result, Hector's wardrobe comes from all over the world - Japan, the Punjab, Brazil, and, of course, the couple's own acclaimed baby collection in cashmere. Menswear pioneer Paul Smith was again one of the first into this new market, introducing Paul Smith for Children in 1990. It was, he says, a direct response to his customers who had begun to enter their thirties and parenthood. 'Initially, it was developed as a boys' collection,' he says, 'as so many of our customers had been asking for it. It did really well, so when we launched Paul Smith Women I added girlswear to the range, too.' The range has now been broadened further, with some made-to-measure items at the Westbourne House flagship store in London's Notting Hill. The shop also features a purpose-built playroom and a splitting of the range into three distinct labels for autumn/winter 2000 - Paul Smith Sport, Paul Smith for Children and Paul Smith Blue Label. Astute as ever, Smith's timing has been impeccable, and there is generally a well-placed understanding of what is needed for visually strong outfits that are also wearable and child-appropriate. Although the range is quite separate from the men's and women's collections, there is a definite link between it and the two adult lines. 'Some of the key pieces from my mainline collections are scaled down to fit a little person,' he says, 'such as our menswear jacket complete with contrast-colour top-stitching and a bright patchwork lining.' Smith was also one of the first to spot the mass-market potential of designer childrenswear, with Freemans mail-order catalogue carrying his children's T-shirts. He's not the last, though. In June 1998, the Top Shop-to-Burton group Arcadia bought the Liverpool-based group Wade Smith for \u00a315.8m, announcing that it saw growth potential in catering for the demand for designer childrenswear among the not- so-middle classes. The store heavily features the big name brands, such as Ralph Lauren, Armani, DKNY, Calvin Klein, YSL and Ted Baker, and marks out the north-west along with Essex as one of the birthplaces of designer childrenswear for the less affluent. It was in these two areas that designer menswear really took hold, and so it's not surprising to see the same labels - Armani, CP Company, Replay and Paul Smith - walking out of childrenswear stores by the taxi-full. The latest to move in on the childrenswear market has been Debenhams, which has extended its Designers at Debenhams range into childrenswear, first with Jasper Conran, with baby and boyswear at Christmas, and just a couple of weeks ago, with the Sweet pea girlswear collection from the acclaimed British designer, Elspeth Gibson. Gibson, one of this country's hottest talents and the New Generation Designer of the Year 1998, had never designed childrenswear before, but says she had great fun designing the collection, which ranges from ages three to eight, despite not having children of her own. 'I wanted to do something a little bit special,' she says, 'but I also wanted it to be fun and easy-going. Now, Gibson is expecting her first child, a little girl in May, and has already designed the autumn/winter 2000 collection. Her summer collection is, apparently, selling like hot cakes, with the first items gaining repeat orders from the stores just a week after going on sale. Like the Jasper Conran boyswear, the range is very affordable (from \u00a36 to \u00a326) and, following on from her own womenswear collection, mixes traditional femininity with a modern sensibility. But it's not all plain sailing. With one or two exceptions, there's still - comparatively - a lack of good boyswear, and there have been casualties. The fact is, the market is, and will always be, small compared with womenswear and menswear, if only because prices are lower (and this despite the fact that the costs are not necessarily that different - although fabric costs may be cheaper, the manufacturing costs for childrenswear may be as high as womenswear, and design costs possibly higher, due to the various safety regulations that apply). Dries van Noten, for example, had to give up doing his childrenswear collection, possibly the most exquisite in the world, when work pressures caused him to choose between that or the vastly more profitable menswear. But the days of the pink frilly dress and the tweed jacket have gone forever. At least that's what I thought until I went to the childrenswear shows in Florence last month to see the autumn/winter 2000 collections and saw... bright pink and tweed everywhere. But that's fashion for you. \u0095 Chris Taggart is editor-in-chief of the upmarket parenting magazine Junior, the March/April issue of which has just been published.

Northern Ireland's complicated peace process, with its springs, balancing mechanisms, delicate coils and many cogs, lies this morning scattered across the floor of Peter Mandelson's Belfast office. No one yet has a clear idea about how to put it back together again - not Mr Mandelson, or Tony Blair, not the Irish Government, Sinn Fein or the Unionists. But, on the other hand, nobody wants it not to be rebuilt.</p> <p>As with John Harrison's famous clock immortalised in Longitude, the answer may well be to build another. H1, of course, was only intended to help sailors get round the world; this process is about navigating the far greater distance between the mind of Irish republicanism and the mind of unionism.</p> <p>But what is needed is to extend the deal in both directions, getting a clear answer on decommissioning, but also reassuring Republicans about British bona fides. Both will be hard. Mr Mandelson stands accused of applying the style of politics learned by the New Labour modernisers in London - tough leadership, clarity of language, ultimatums and some bullying - to the politics of Northern Ireland, with catastrophic results.</p> <p>Why did he impose an earlier deadline, dictated by David Trimble? Why did he not allow the extra time for the second decommissioning report to be considered? Why did he try to bring speed and certainty into a process which has moved by slow, serpentine paths and vagueness? The Irish and Sinn Fein answer is that he has lurched towards the Unionists, that the British Government alone has broken the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>What this fails to acknowledge is just how infuriating the refusal of the IRA to move an inch towards real decommissioning has been for everybody else. In the end, many Unionists think they will never give up their weapons and will simply go back to war when they have won the maximum political advantage. They believe Mr Trimble has been a fool and is now exposed as such. So yes, the IRA may split, yet again, but so too may unionism, yet again. We believe that either split would be very bad. The peace process needs the current IRA leadership and it needs David Trimble, too.</p> <p>So what should be done? First, Mr Mandelson needs to persuade Sinn Fein that he is not a Unionist stooge. London must now move further on its preferred timetable for demilitarisation and confidence-building, including the thousands of legal guns held by Unionists. At the same time, Sinn Fein must recognise that the watching world is getting fed up of the self-righteous prevarication of the IRA over decommissioning.</p> <p>If their analysis is right, that demography, politics and economics are all driving towards an eventual unification of Ireland, then the IRA has nothing to lose except a little face. And it must lose some face, as must London, in the changes to cap badges, the pulling-down of forts, flags and so on. What is 'face'? Nothing. There cannot be a peaceful society which lives forever between armed, proud, well-trained military camps.</p>",

But, on the other hand, nobody wants it not to be rebuilt. As with John Harrison's famous clock immortalised in Longitude, the answer may well be to build another. H1, of course, was only intended to help sailors get round the world; this process is about navigating the far greater distance between the mind of Irish republicanism and the mind of unionism. But what is needed is to extend the deal in both directions, getting a clear answer on decommissioning, but also reassuring Republicans about British bona fides. Both will be hard. Mr Mandelson stands accused of applying the style of politics learned by the New Labour modernisers in London - tough leadership, clarity of language, ultimatums and some bullying - to the politics of Northern Ireland, with catastrophic results. Why did he impose an earlier deadline, dictated by David Trimble? Why did he not allow the extra time for the second decommissioning report to be considered? Why did he try to bring speed and certainty into a process which has moved by slow, serpentine paths and vagueness? The Irish and Sinn Fein answer is that he has lurched towards the Unionists, that the British Government alone has broken the Good Friday Agreement. What this fails to acknowledge is just how infuriating the refusal of the IRA to move an inch towards real decommissioning has been for everybody else. In the end, many Unionists think they will never give up their weapons and will simply go back to war when they have won the maximum political advantage. They believe Mr Trimble has been a fool and is now exposed as such. So yes, the IRA may split, yet again, but so too may unionism, yet again. We believe that either split would be very bad. The peace process needs the current IRA leadership and it needs David Trimble, too. So what should be done? First, Mr Mandelson needs to persuade Sinn Fein that he is not a Unionist stooge. London must now move further on its preferred timetable for demilitarisation and confidence-building, including the thousands of legal guns held by Unionists. At the same time, Sinn Fein must recognise that the watching world is getting fed up of the self-righteous prevarication of the IRA over decommissioning. If their analysis is right, that demography, politics and economics are all driving towards an eventual unification of Ireland, then the IRA has nothing to lose except a little face. And it must lose some face, as must London, in the changes to cap badges, the pulling-down of forts, flags and so on. What is 'face'? Nothing. There cannot be a peaceful society which lives forever between armed, proud, well-trained military camps.",

He arrived in the province at a fortunate moment, as the political parties were groping towards an accommodation.</p> <p>Mandelson, a fresh face with a direct line to the Prime Minister, used his credentials to persuade the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble to take a risk and join Sinn Fein in government before any arms had been handed over.</p> <p>Now the whole edifice has come crashing down after only 72 days of devolution. A welter of recrimination has begun, with disputed accounts of who said what to whom on the fateful Frantic Friday nine days ago when Mandelson decided to suspend the institutions.</p> <p>Gerry Adams has dismissed him as Trimble's spin doctor and the man who succumbed to the Unionist veto. In private, Sinn Fein brands Mandelson a liar, an international law breaker and the author of convulsions inside the IRA.</p> <p>In an interview with The Observer, Mandelson starts by asking republicans to put his demonised role in some perspective. 'Those who accuse me of dancing to the Unionist tune should remember it was I who helped persuade Trimble to \"jump\" in November and join the government,' he said.</p> <p>'At that time, I was a Sinn Fein hero. I also took the decision to implement the Patten report on policing in full - hardly a Unionist-friendly move.</p> <p>'I have made clear I am determined to continue to implement the Good Friday Agreement, including equality, human rights, criminal justice, prisoners and Patten.'</p> <p>He points out that he and the Irish never disguised the fact they would suspend the institutions if the process ran into difficulty.</p> <p>'Both governments said we would be the wicket-keeper, or the safety net, for this process. It was our way of encouraging the Unionists to reverse their stance of \"decommissioning before government\". The Unionists did so, but only on the basis that if decommissioning did not occur, or any default arose, the institutions would be suspended.'</p> <p>He has also been accused of making a critical error in letting the Unionists set a deadline for decommissioning of February, when the Good Friday agreement only requires full decommissioning by 22 May.</p> <p>Mandelson replies: 'How could I stop them? I could not stop Trimble saying that, as the price for jumping first in November, he was to consult his party in February over whether disarmament was occurring.</p> <p>'But for me the February meeting of the Ulster Unionist council was never the operative deadline. We all knew that what mattered was what General John de Chastelain, the chairman of the decommissioning body, had to say in January. Trimble could not sustain Unionist participation in government much beyond January if there was no decommissioning. That was a fact of political life.'</p> <p>But did Mandelson in the final hectic 24 hours before suspension misread signals from the IRA? Those final hours have already become the subject of one of the most intensive three-way briefing wars between Sinn Fein, Dublin and the British.</p> <p>Sinn Fein claim the new IRA position was relayed to Downing Street by 8am on Friday morning and Mandelson, bent on protecting Trimble's leadership, was wilful in rejecting it at 5pm, just 90 minutes before De Chastelain issued his second, more hopeful report.</p> <p>Mandelson's account sharply differs. 'On the eve of the Friday suspension order, I urged Adams that if there was a new position from the IRA that they should see De Chastelain early and he should see David Trimble so there should be the maximum time to turn round the situation. I had planned to sign the suspension order at midday that Friday, but at 11 o'clock that morning we were told by Irish officials of overnight developments, including a proposal on the latest IRA position.</p> <p>'I immediately put back the suspension until 2.30 and the Prime Minister and I agreed that if there was a clear and public commitment to put arms completely and fully beyond use, we would take that very seriously. I also asked Gerry Adams to see Trimble to tell him what was on offer. At 2.30, I again put back the announcement, until five o'clock.</p> <p>'But instead of Adams going to see Trimble, McGuinness went, gave him no details of the latest IRA proposal and simply demanded that he withdraw his resignation letter and the meeting of his council the following morning.</p> <p>'I even suggested post-dating the moment the suspension came into effect until Monday to give time to clarify the IRA position. Sinn Fein were not interested in that proposal.</p> <p>'The problem through the whole day was that we did not know what De Chastelain was going to say. I was aware of different bits of paper floating around, but we did not know their status, what would be said to De Chastelain, what he would be able to report and what would become public.'</p> <p>He is careful not to dismiss the new IRA position, as relayed in the second De Chastelain report published following the suspension, saying it contained 'real potential' and now had to be built on. His enthusiasm only goes so far.</p> <p>'It represented a significant move, but it was unclear and undefinitive that decommissioning would actually take place. If we had had that report describing the IRA's position a fortnight before, that would have given us 14 days to explore what the IRA meant to the satisfaction of the Unionists whose confidence by then had evaporated and was running on empty. But to do that in the space of one evening, when a suspension decision had taken place, was simply not possible.'</p> <p>He admits the Irish and British have had disputes. But Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and Prime Minister Tony Blair agreed that the process needed Trimble, and for him to be replaced by a different leadership opposed to the Good Friday Agreement would be a catastrophe.</p> <p>His task now is to rebuild confidence. He will stay in Northern Ireland this week to start the process rather than travel to the US, as previously planned. His personal relations with Adams have not broken down, he says. 'There has been no shouting match.'</p> <p>He pointedly congratulated Adams and McGuinness for putting so much effort into the process. 'Despite all Adams's efforts, and they were considerable, he was unable to persuade all of the IRA to come in behind him. I understand his desire to avoid a split, because that could have resulted in the dissident republicans being strengthened.' He does not now favour a formal review, speaking instead of 'discussions and consultations to put the whole thing back together again.'</p> <p>He then holds out an olive branch to nationalists on security, police and criminal justice reform. 'There is no aspect of the Good Friday Agreement for which the government has responsibility that we have not either implemented, moved on or are in a position to implement soon. Twenty six Army bases have been closed. Army patrolling is down two-thirds. Troop levels are lower than at any time since 1970, and I have made clear that as the security threat continues to recede normalisation will continue to go forward apace.'</p> <p>There is no denying the intensity of the republican anger, but humour also remains. 'Adams, when he was speaking to the two Prime Ministers last week, was in full flow when he suddenly looked at me and said, \"By the way, we will be attacking you as an individual, but you should not take it personally\", and everyone laughed.'</p>",

Indeed, for these are the most testing times for Mandelson. He arrived in the province at a fortunate moment, as the political parties were groping towards an accommodation. Mandelson, a fresh face with a direct line to the Prime Minister, used his credentials to persuade the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble to take a risk and join Sinn Fein in government before any arms had been handed over. Now the whole edifice has come crashing down after only 72 days of devolution. A welter of recrimination has begun, with disputed accounts of who said what to whom on the fateful Frantic Friday nine days ago when Mandelson decided to suspend the institutions. Gerry Adams has dismissed him as Trimble's spin doctor and the man who succumbed to the Unionist veto. In private, Sinn Fein brands Mandelson a liar, an international law breaker and the author of convulsions inside the IRA. In an interview with The Observer, Mandelson starts by asking republicans to put his demonised role in some perspective. 'Those who accuse me of dancing to the Unionist tune should remember it was I who helped persuade Trimble to \"jump\" in November and join the government,' he said. 'At that time, I was a Sinn Fein hero. I also took the decision to implement the Patten report on policing in full - hardly a Unionist-friendly move. 'I have made clear I am determined to continue to implement the Good Friday Agreement, including equality, human rights, criminal justice, prisoners and Patten.' He points out that he and the Irish never disguised the fact they would suspend the institutions if the process ran into difficulty. 'Both governments said we would be the wicket-keeper, or the safety net, for this process. It was our way of encouraging the Unionists to reverse their stance of \"decommissioning before government\". The Unionists did so, but only on the basis that if decommissioning did not occur, or any default arose, the institutions would be suspended.' He has also been accused of making a critical error in letting the Unionists set a deadline for decommissioning of February, when the Good Friday agreement only requires full decommissioning by 22 May. Mandelson replies: 'How could I stop them? I could not stop Trimble saying that, as the price for jumping first in November, he was to consult his party in February over whether disarmament was occurring. 'But for me the February meeting of the Ulster Unionist council was never the operative deadline. We all knew that what mattered was what General John de Chastelain, the chairman of the decommissioning body, had to say in January. Trimble could not sustain Unionist participation in government much beyond January if there was no decommissioning. That was a fact of political life.' But did Mandelson in the final hectic 24 hours before suspension misread signals from the IRA? Those final hours have already become the subject of one of the most intensive three-way briefing wars between Sinn Fein, Dublin and the British. Sinn Fein claim the new IRA position was relayed to Downing Street by 8am on Friday morning and Mandelson, bent on protecting Trimble's leadership, was wilful in rejecting it at 5pm, just 90 minutes before De Chastelain issued his second, more hopeful report. Mandelson's account sharply differs. 'On the eve of the Friday suspension order, I urged Adams that if there was a new position from the IRA that they should see De Chastelain early and he should see David Trimble so there should be the maximum time to turn round the situation. I had planned to sign the suspension order at midday that Friday, but at 11 o'clock that morning we were told by Irish officials of overnight developments, including a proposal on the latest IRA position. 'I immediately put back the suspension until 2.30 and the Prime Minister and I agreed that if there was a clear and public commitment to put arms completely and fully beyond use, we would take that very seriously. I also asked Gerry Adams to see Trimble to tell him what was on offer. At 2.30, I again put back the announcement, until five o'clock. 'But instead of Adams going to see Trimble, McGuinness went, gave him no details of the latest IRA proposal and simply demanded that he withdraw his resignation letter and the meeting of his council the following morning. 'I even suggested post-dating the moment the suspension came into effect until Monday to give time to clarify the IRA position. Sinn Fein were not interested in that proposal. 'The problem through the whole day was that we did not know what De Chastelain was going to say. I was aware of different bits of paper floating around, but we did not know their status, what would be said to De Chastelain, what he would be able to report and what would become public.' He is careful not to dismiss the new IRA position, as relayed in the second De Chastelain report published following the suspension, saying it contained 'real potential' and now had to be built on. His enthusiasm only goes so far. 'It represented a significant move, but it was unclear and undefinitive that decommissioning would actually take place. If we had had that report describing the IRA's position a fortnight before, that would have given us 14 days to explore what the IRA meant to the satisfaction of the Unionists whose confidence by then had evaporated and was running on empty. But to do that in the space of one evening, when a suspension decision had taken place, was simply not possible.' He admits the Irish and British have had disputes. But Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and Prime Minister Tony Blair agreed that the process needed Trimble, and for him to be replaced by a different leadership opposed to the Good Friday Agreement would be a catastrophe. His task now is to rebuild confidence. He will stay in Northern Ireland this week to start the process rather than travel to the US, as previously planned. His personal relations with Adams have not broken down, he says. 'There has been no shouting match.' He pointedly congratulated Adams and McGuinness for putting so much effort into the process. 'Despite all Adams's efforts, and they were considerable, he was unable to persuade all of the IRA to come in behind him. I understand his desire to avoid a split, because that could have resulted in the dissident republicans being strengthened.' He does not now favour a formal review, speaking instead of 'discussions and consultations to put the whole thing back together again.' He then holds out an olive branch to nationalists on security, police and criminal justice reform. 'There is no aspect of the Good Friday Agreement for which the government has responsibility that we have not either implemented, moved on or are in a position to implement soon. Twenty six Army bases have been closed. Army patrolling is down two-thirds. Troop levels are lower than at any time since 1970, and I have made clear that as the security threat continues to recede normalisation will continue to go forward apace.' There is no denying the intensity of the republican anger, but humour also remains. 'Adams, when he was speaking to the two Prime Ministers last week, was in full flow when he suddenly looked at me and said, \"By the way, we will be attacking you as an individual, but you should not take it personally\", and everyone laughed.'",

The young men who greeted the dealers' representatives in the pal-azzo's imposing reception rooms were his son Andrea and son-in-law Nicolo. The beautiful blonde who fragrantly completed the exquisite decor of the house was Bassoli's young Czech girlfriend. At least the building was real: it was the home of the Marquesa de Macchiavelli. The cheque for the $10,000 rent bounced.</p> <p>The Venice sting netted the gang a seventeenth-century masterpiece by Giacomo Guardi - taken from the British dealer Derek Johns and worth \u00a360,000 - 14 prints by Tiepolo, D\u00fcrer and Canaletto, some diamonds and several magnificent Dutch still lifes.</p> <p>The gang, art detectives say, is now 'holed up' in Prague. Bassoli 'holds court' at the Hilton Casino most evenings, sources say. Wanted by at least four police forces and Interpol, he lives relatively openly. 'The gang work in the most old-fashioned way possible,' said one investigator on their trail. 'They are straightforward conmen. And they are very, very good.'</p> <p>The Venice sting was masterful. The first step for the gang was to tour the prestigious art fair at Maastricht in Holland in March and spot likely targets. Then contact was made. A few months later two dozen art dealers, including several in London, were telephoned by a well-spoken elderly gentleman, 'Count Cenni'. Wary and not overly enthusiastic, 'Cenni' explained - in English, French or Italian as required - that he was interested in buying one or two of a number of works he had seen exhibited earlier in the year.</p> <p>They would be perfect, he said, as a present for his daughter, who was getting married in Venice in July. He would be in the city for a week or so in June and would love to view the works then - if convenient. Charmed and convinced, the dealers agreed. The sting was on.</p> <p>When Luigi brought the dealers' reps to the palazzo, they were told, with exquisite courtesy and grace, that Count Cenni was 'unavoidably detained' at a hospital nearby, where his mother was receiving treatment. A call from Cenni himself reassured them that he was legitimate. Could they possibly leave the painting until he arrived, he asked. Clutching a receipt, the representatives agreed and the paintings joined the others on the walls.</p> <p>If they demurred, there were more telephone conversations and discreet pressure was applied. Cenni would phone them to offer words of reassurance. The dealers would be offered a paid room in the hotel next door or, as a last resort, drugged coffee usually secured the goods. Twelve hours later it was all over. Overnight, the gang had cleared out.</p> <p>Only a handful of the stolen works have been recovered. Detectives have been frustrated by their inability to catch Bassoli. One chance was missed when two members of the gang were arrested in London a month after the Venice sting. A suspicious dealer called the police after being offered stolen prints, but the men were freed for lack of evidence.</p> <p>The gang has been linked to a series of stings through out Italy as well as in Spain and southern Germany. Many cases involve antiquarian booksellers. One Munich-based dealer was contacted by the gang and asked to come to Venice with a copy of Sir Isaac Newton's Opticks and five other antiquarian volumes. He left the books and the gang disappeared.</p> <p>French police have linked Bassoli to the theft last February of an album of nineteenth-century French watercolours of India which were delivered to Venice as supposed presents for the children of an 'Italian collector'. The cheques bounced.</p> <p>Detectives think Bassoli is likely to use his links with the Mafia to fence the stolen items. It is often easier for thieves to use the stolen goods as collateral for huge loans from unsuspecting banks.</p> <p>Art detectives have received intelligence that Bassoli's gang is planning a thieving spree to coincide with this year's Maastricht art fair next month. 'These are clever people and the whole art world has to be aware of the threat,' said Charles Hill, a risk manager with AXA Nordstern art</p>",

The Venice sting netted the gang a seventeenth-century masterpiece by Giacomo Guardi - taken from the British dealer Derek Johns and worth \u00a360,000 - 14 prints by Tiepolo, D\u00fcrer and Canaletto, some diamonds and several magnificent Dutch still lifes. The gang, art detectives say, is now 'holed up' in Prague. Bassoli 'holds court' at the Hilton Casino most evenings, sources say. Wanted by at least four police forces and Interpol, he lives relatively openly. 'The gang work in the most old-fashioned way possible,' said one investigator on their trail. 'They are straightforward conmen. And they are very, very good.' The Venice sting was masterful. The first step for the gang was to tour the prestigious art fair at Maastricht in Holland in March and spot likely targets. Then contact was made. A few months later two dozen art dealers, including several in London, were telephoned by a well-spoken elderly gentleman, 'Count Cenni'. Wary and not overly enthusiastic, 'Cenni' explained - in English, French or Italian as required - that he was interested in buying one or two of a number of works he had seen exhibited earlier in the year. They would be perfect, he said, as a present for his daughter, who was getting married in Venice in July. He would be in the city for a week or so in June and would love to view the works then - if convenient. Charmed and convinced, the dealers agreed. The sting was on. When Luigi brought the dealers' reps to the palazzo, they were told, with exquisite courtesy and grace, that Count Cenni was 'unavoidably detained' at a hospital nearby, where his mother was receiving treatment. A call from Cenni himself reassured them that he was legitimate. Could they possibly leave the painting until he arrived, he asked. Clutching a receipt, the representatives agreed and the paintings joined the others on the walls. If they demurred, there were more telephone conversations and discreet pressure was applied. Cenni would phone them to offer words of reassurance. The dealers would be offered a paid room in the hotel next door or, as a last resort, drugged coffee usually secured the goods. Twelve hours later it was all over. Overnight, the gang had cleared out. Only a handful of the stolen works have been recovered. Detectives have been frustrated by their inability to catch Bassoli. One chance was missed when two members of the gang were arrested in London a month after the Venice sting. A suspicious dealer called the police after being offered stolen prints, but the men were freed for lack of evidence. The gang has been linked to a series of stings through out Italy as well as in Spain and southern Germany. Many cases involve antiquarian booksellers. One Munich-based dealer was contacted by the gang and asked to come to Venice with a copy of Sir Isaac Newton's Opticks and five other antiquarian volumes. He left the books and the gang disappeared. French police have linked Bassoli to the theft last February of an album of nineteenth-century French watercolours of India which were delivered to Venice as supposed presents for the children of an 'Italian collector'. The cheques bounced. Detectives think Bassoli is likely to use his links with the Mafia to fence the stolen items. It is often easier for thieves to use the stolen goods as collateral for huge loans from unsuspecting banks. Art detectives have received intelligence that Bassoli's gang is planning a thieving spree to coincide with this year's Maastricht art fair next month. 'These are clever people and the whole art world has to be aware of the threat,' said Charles Hill, a risk manager with AXA Nordstern art",

      "body": "<p>It's probably techno-paranoia talking, but have you noticed that most things computer-related are never as simple as they seem? </p> <p>Take 'free' Internet access, for example. </p> <p>You might think 'free' means 'no cost'. It doesn't. For btclick, Freeserve, LineOne, Yahoo! and the majority of free Internet Service Providers (ISPs), it means 'free - if you don't count the cost of phone calls'. With other ISPs, the 'free' part comes in the form of 'unmetered access' which means you connect to the Internet via an 0800 number. The ISP picks up the bill for the phone calls but in exchange you pay a monthly fee ranging from \u00a311.75 for BT Internet's unmetered access (weekends only) to \u00a349.99 for the FreeTime Unlimited package under trial through ClaraNet. </p> <p>Free email can be something of a misnomer too. </p> <p>It's true ISPs don't charge for providing you with an email address but there is a cost involved in connecting to the phone line. Experienced users will already know that if you want to keep email phone charges to a minimum, you make sure the ISP offers POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3) email. With this sort, you type messages off-line and connect to the phone only when you want to send (or receive) your emails. </p> <p>If you have to connect to the Internet before you can get at, or send, emails, it isn't POP3, it's web-based email. Because you can send messages from 'home, work, school, an Internet cafe, a friend's house or any other computer in the world, this is great for people who use more than one computer, travel frequently, or don't even own a computer', says Hotmail, the first web-based email provider. It's less than great if you like to take your time over your cyber missives: every minute spent polishing your prose is another minute added to your phone bill. Spend more than five minutes during peak rate and you might as well have sent a letter. </p> <p>Not that the type of email you use will matter if you switch to an ISP which offers genuinely free internet access. The first and currently the only one of these, is callNet0800 which promises 'no phone charges, no set-up costs, no monthly subscription costs and totally free Internet access at any time of the day or night'. So what's the catch? There may be no phone charges or set-up costs for the Internet service but you can only have that if you register as a telephone customer of CallNet. This involves an up-front charge of \u00a319.99 for a dialler to plug into your normal telephone socket which diverts your voice calls to CallNet. Apart from call charges (which CallNet claims are 30 per cent cheaper than BT's standard tariffs) there are no other costs involved nor are there any minimum call spends. And because the first \u00a320-worth of calls are free, you can recoup the cost of the dialler. </p> <p>But does the fact that it's free mean the Internet service it offers isn't any good? Apparently not, according to existing CallNet customers who report that speed and quality are at least as good as they had experienced with other ISPs. The main problem for new customers is the wait of up to 28 days for the dialler to arrive. </p> <p>Until two other genuinely free ISPs, SMI FreeNet and 0800Freedom, launch their promised services, the alternative to callNet0800 is to switch to an ISP which offers a limited amount of free time on the Internet. Bank of Scotland and LineOne, for example, offer 500 free minutes (just over 8 hours) of free off-peak Internet access each month to customers who route their voice calls through Quip? and spend a minimum of \u00a35; customers spending at least \u00a310 get 1,000 free minutes. </p> <p>A similar scheme from Freeserve gives three hours of free Internet time for customers spending between \u00a33 and \u00a310 a month; 10 hours for call spends of \u00a310 and above. </p> <p>\u0095 Contacts: Register for callNet 0800 by visiting <a href=\"http://www.callnet0800.com\">www.callnet0800.com</a> or by phoning 0906 944 4040 for an application form. </p> <p>For up-to-date information on more than 400 free ISPs, including news on other 'totally free ISPs', visit <a href=\"http://www.net4nowt.com\">www.net4nowt.com</a></p>",

Because you can send messages from 'home, work, school, an Internet cafe, a friend's house or any other computer in the world, this is great for people who use more than one computer, travel frequently, or don't even own a computer', says Hotmail, the first web-based email provider. It's less than great if you like to take your time over your cyber missives: every minute spent polishing your prose is another minute added to your phone bill. Spend more than five minutes during peak rate and you might as well have sent a letter. Not that the type of email you use will matter if you switch to an ISP which offers genuinely free internet access. The first and currently the only one of these, is callNet0800 which promises 'no phone charges, no set-up costs, no monthly subscription costs and totally free Internet access at any time of the day or night'. So what's the catch? There may be no phone charges or set-up costs for the Internet service but you can only have that if you register as a telephone customer of CallNet. This involves an up-front charge of \u00a319.99 for a dialler to plug into your normal telephone socket which diverts your voice calls to CallNet. Apart from call charges (which CallNet claims are 30 per cent cheaper than BT's standard tariffs) there are no other costs involved nor are there any minimum call spends. And because the first \u00a320-worth of calls are free, you can recoup the cost of the dialler. But does the fact that it's free mean the Internet service it offers isn't any good? Apparently not, according to existing CallNet customers who report that speed and quality are at least as good as they had experienced with other ISPs. The main problem for new customers is the wait of up to 28 days for the dialler to arrive. Until two other genuinely free ISPs, SMI FreeNet and 0800Freedom, launch their promised services, the alternative to callNet0800 is to switch to an ISP which offers a limited amount of free time on the Internet. Bank of Scotland and LineOne, for example, offer 500 free minutes (just over 8 hours) of free off-peak Internet access each month to customers who route their voice calls through Quip? and spend a minimum of \u00a35; customers spending at least \u00a310 get 1,000 free minutes. A similar scheme from Freeserve gives three hours of free Internet time for customers spending between \u00a33 and \u00a310 a month; 10 hours for call spends of \u00a310 and above. \u0095 Contacts: Register for callNet 0800 by visiting www.callnet0800.com or by phoning 0906 944 4040 for an application form.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>J\u00f5rg Passon came to the UK from Germany in 1962 and for many years worked in clerical jobs. </p> <p>In 1983, J\u00f6rg and his wife set up a nursing home business but, in time, the strain of operating the home meant they grew apart and separated five years ago. </p> <p>They continued to manage the nursing home together, but are now divorcing and selling up. </p> <p>J\u00f6rg wants to find another job, and expects to earn between \u00a310,000 and \u00a315,000 as a manager in a care home or as an English/German translator. </p> <p>When the loans on the nursing home are repaid, the sale will produce about \u00a344,000 after tax. The business will be split 60/40 in his wife's favour and the marital home, worth about \u00a3207,000, will be divided equally between them. </p> <p>J\u00f6rg says: 'This gives me, theoretically, \u00a3106,000. I say 'theoretically' because my wife would like to remain in the marital home for now. I have no problem with that, since I am living with my partner in a flat.' </p> <p>J\u00f6rg splits regular expenditure with his new partner: this comes to about \u00a3400 a month. The \u00a312,000 mortgage on the marital home is secured on a personal pension with Allied Dunbar. He is paying \u00a347 a month into this pension and interest on the loan costs \u00a367 a month. All the mortgages will be repaid by 2001. </p> <p>Another Allied Dunbar personal pension will provide a lump sum of \u00a34,310 at age 60, with a pension of \u00a31,240. A pension from his time working at Lloyds Bank will produce \u00a31,030 at the same age and one from a 13-year stint with a ship insurer could pay up to \u00a32,500 from the age of 65. He has also requested a forecast for the state pension. </p> <p>J\u00f6rg can foresee several options. One would be to leave his half-share in the family home - in London's Blackheath - to increase in value as an investment. Or he could take his share and use the money to repay his partner's mortgage. </p> <p>He could buy another property to rent out or put a large lump sum into his pension, using earlier years' allowances. The main advantage of this is tax relief, but the drawback is that he has agreed to split his pensions 50-50 with his wife. </p> <p>'Do I just take the money, both from the business and the marital home, acknowledge that, at my age, this is as good as it gets, and live happily ever after?' J\u00f6rg asks.</p> <p><strong>Vital statistics</strong></p> <p>Age: 58 <br>Lives in: South London <br>Occupation: Proprietor of nursing home about to be sold <br>Earns: Potentially \u00a310,000 to \u00a315,000 <br>Mortgage: Four, totalling \u00a338,000 <br>Debts: None <br>Investments: None <br>Pensions: Two personal pensions and two from previous employment <br>Aims: To live as well as financial circumstances allow following divorce</p> <p> <strong>Adviser 1: Justin Modray </strong></p> <p>Although tempting, given the current buoyancy of the property market, leaving the funds within the marital home decreases the flexibility and tax efficiency of Mr Passon's assets compared with traditional investments. Also, investment returns are effectively via capital growth, not income. This may not be a short-term problem if Mr Passon decides to work again but will be of little benefit during retirement when income is a priority. </p> <p>Buying a property to let looks attractive on the surface as rents are relatively high, but property is not a liquid investment. It would be too unbalanced an investment for Mr Passon as it will account for the bulk of his capital. Further pension funding cannot be recommended as any contributions made will be half for his wife's benefit.</p> <p>The most sensible route is to take out his share in the marital home and make lump-sum investments. He could invest for growth and then turn to income when required.</p> <p>With the sum of capital potentially available, Mr Passon should be able to generate income of about \u00a36,000 gross a year while maintaining good potential for capital growth.</p> <p>He should invest in a mixture of investments of varying risk, but keep about \u00a320,000 in the bank as 'rainy day' money.

      "bodyText": "J\u00f5rg Passon came to the UK from Germany in 1962 and for many years worked in clerical jobs. In 1983, J\u00f6rg and his wife set up a nursing home business but, in time, the strain of operating the home meant they grew apart and separated five years ago. They continued to manage the nursing home together, but are now divorcing and selling up. J\u00f6rg wants to find another job, and expects to earn between \u00a310,000 and \u00a315,000 as a manager in a care home or as an English/German translator. When the loans on the nursing home are repaid, the sale will produce about \u00a344,000 after tax. The business will be split 60/40 in his wife's favour and the marital home, worth about \u00a3207,000, will be divided equally between them. J\u00f6rg says: 'This gives me, theoretically, \u00a3106,000. I say 'theoretically' because my wife would like to remain in the marital home for now. I have no problem with that, since I am living with my partner in a flat.' J\u00f6rg splits regular expenditure with his new partner: this comes to about \u00a3400 a month. The \u00a312,000 mortgage on the marital home is secured on a personal pension with Allied Dunbar. He is paying \u00a347 a month into this pension and interest on the loan costs \u00a367 a month. All the mortgages will be repaid by 2001. Another Allied Dunbar personal pension will provide a lump sum of \u00a34,310 at age 60, with a pension of \u00a31,240. A pension from his time working at Lloyds Bank will produce \u00a31,030 at the same age and one from a 13-year stint with a ship insurer could pay up to \u00a32,500 from the age of 65. He has also requested a forecast for the state pension. J\u00f6rg can foresee several options. One would be to leave his half-share in the family home - in London's Blackheath - to increase in value as an investment. Or he could take his share and use the money to repay his partner's mortgage. He could buy another property to rent out or put a large lump sum into his pension, using earlier years' allowances. The main advantage of this is tax relief, but the drawback is that he has agreed to split his pensions 50-50 with his wife. 'Do I just take the money, both from the business and the marital home, acknowledge that, at my age, this is as good as it gets, and live happily ever after?' J\u00f6rg asks. Vital statistics Age: 58 Lives in: South London Occupation: Proprietor of nursing home about to be sold Earns: Potentially \u00a310,000 to \u00a315,000 Mortgage: Four, totalling \u00a338,000 Debts: None Investments: None Pensions: Two personal pensions and two from previous employment Aims: To live as well as financial circumstances allow following divorce Adviser 1: Justin Modray Although tempting, given the current buoyancy of the property market, leaving the funds within the marital home decreases the flexibility and tax efficiency of Mr Passon's assets compared with traditional investments. Also, investment returns are effectively via capital growth, not income. This may not be a short-term problem if Mr Passon decides to work again but will be of little benefit during retirement when income is a priority. Buying a property to let looks attractive on the surface as rents are relatively high, but property is not a liquid investment. It would be too unbalanced an investment for Mr Passon as it will account for the bulk of his capital. Further pension funding cannot be recommended as any contributions made will be half for his wife's benefit. The most sensible route is to take out his share in the marital home and make lump-sum investments. He could invest for growth and then turn to income when required. With the sum of capital potentially available, Mr Passon should be able to generate income of about \u00a36,000 gross a year while maintaining good potential for capital growth. He should invest in a mixture of investments of varying risk, but keep about \u00a320,000 in the bank as 'rainy day' money. He should also take advantage of an Isa's tax benefits and use his allowance to invest in a corporate bond fund to generate a high level of tax-free income. He should include a with-profits bond and stock market based unit trusts. \u0095 Justin Modray is a financial adviser with Bath-based Chase de Vere. Adviser 2: Danielle Leich Mr Passon should not rush into reducing his partner's mortgage without taking legal advice to ensure that a percentage of the property is put into his name. As Mr Passon's wife will get half of all his pensions, he should hesitate before increasing contributions. Although he would get 23 per cent tax relief on the payments, he would lose 50 per cent. I assume the marital mortgage of \u00a312,000 is a joint liability, so it is not sensible for Mr Passon to reduce this debt with his own capital. If the \u00a312,000 is repaid from the pension payout, it reduces the lump sum to \u00a32,100 with a pension of \u00a34,290 a year, both split with his ex-wife. If he keeps the pension and the loan until he is 65, he has to pay a further \u00a36,840, which is \u00a347 pension con tributions plus \u00a367 mortgage interest, multiplied by 12 multiplied by five. This is possible only if the bank agrees to extend the terms for five years and he finds employment that entitles him to make pension contributions.

      "body": "<p>Take a close look at silversmith Richard Fox's candle holder which is on display from Tuesday at the six-day Olympia Spring Fine Art and Antiques Fair. It has been on show around the country for about two years, and has never been polished - yet it is completely free of tarnish. </p> <p>The candle holder is made from a newly discovered tarnish-resistant alloy, sovereign sterling silver, which Fox hails as the most significant development in silversmithing for more than 1,000 years. </p> <p>The silver industry's search for a tarnish-resistant silver has recently acquired an intensity akin to the age-old quest to turn base metals into gold, because younger people too busy to spit-and-polish have been buying stainless steel tableware instead. </p> <p>The secret of sovereign silver, which will soon have its own hallmark and logo, is the addition of 1.1 per cent of the chemical element germanium (Ge), a silvery-grey metalloid with a crystalline structure that resembles diamonds. Germanium absorbs, without trace, the oxygen that causes tarnish. The alloy is also dishwasher-friendly. </p> <p>If you own a silver Post-It note holder that uncannily refuses to lose its lustre, you probably have one of the first sovereign silver products to hit the high street. Made by Fox, these have just sold out at the John Lewis store chain in sizes ranging in price from \u00a375 to \u00a3105, no more than for standard sterling silver. </p> <p>If the Cold War had not ended, the new silver might never have been discovered. Germanium is used in the infrared heat-seeking lenses used on both Russian and US tanks. After communism collapsed, the French mining company that extracts it from zinc and lead ores, Metaleurop, was forced to seek new uses for it. </p> <p>The company telephoned Peter Johns, a silversmith and tutor in applied arts at Middlesex University. Sovereign sterling silver is his discovery. Johns is a freeman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, whose apprentice masterpiece is Canterbury Cathedral's silver processional cross. But he has no training as a metallurgist. </p> <p>He says: 'Metaleurop was looking for any new use for germanium. Because Middlesex Polytechnic, as it then was, had a name for working with a range of metals, they thought we would be open to their crazy idea of a new silver alloy. </p> <p>'This discovery would never have come from a straight metallurgist, because they don't know what the industry wants. I can arrive at solutions more quickly.' </p> <p>The invention coincides with another leap forward in silversmithing: the revival of electroforming - forming a solid silver object by the familiar electroplating process, using a mould immersed in a tank containing silver salts with an electric current running through it. </p> <p>Computerisation and other refinements mean the deposited silver can now accurately replicate fine detail, even engraving. </p> <p>Electroforming was the process used by the London company BJS to make the coronet for Prince Charles's inauguration as Prince of Wales in 1969. BJS is now being commissioned to make silver copies of pieces by craftsmen designers who, only a year or two ago, would have scorned the idea of having copies made. Electroformed silverware costs a third to a half the price of the hand-crafted variety. </p> <p>The first electroform using sovereign silver has yet to be made. But a fusion of the two new methods, combined with designs by contemporary silversmiths of the kind on show at Olympia, could breathe new life into a product that has become unfashionable. </p> <p> Johns has just been granted a European patent for sovereign silver - having beaten an Australian challenger - and is going for an American patent. The new silver is already popular in Finland, Italy and the US. Licence fees could earn him millions. </p> <p>According to a research paper published by Johns, the new silver resists not only the tarnish of time but 'firestain', the grey tarnish that forms on sterling silver when the heat of soldering forces oxygen into it. The silver itself does not oxidise in heat, but the copper, added to give the alloy strength, does. Hence the tarnish. </p> <p>Apart from that 1.1 per cent germanium, the new alloy is little different from Sterling's 925 parts of silver plus 75 parts of copper and zinc. Germanium also adds ductility - the ability to stretch without breaking - so the silver needs less heating and plunging when it is being worked. It is stronger, too, bringing the hope of bigger, more spectacular silverware. </p> <p>Johns says: 'This is the silver that is going to be used for the next 5,000 years. I have ambitious plans to market it, but what I really like is the thought that I'm going to leave to the world something of beauty.' </p> <p>Silversmith Martin Pugh, famous for his cutlery - his butter dish and forks are in the 10 Downing Street Collection and his claret jug in the Millennium Collection - has experimented with the new silver. 'You have to change your craft technique a little, but you don't have to clean off firestain and, once made, the tarnish rate is vastly slower - if it exists at all,' he says. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Fox is turning over his entire production to the new alloy. That will include trophies for the Formula 1 world motor racing championship, domestic wares such as his three-piece tea service (\u00a33,000, only \u00a350 more than ordinary sterling silver might have cost), glasses with silver bases at \u00a360 each, and cutlery. </p> <p>'The last thing you want is to have to polish all the cutlery before a dinner party,' he says, 'so silver that won't oxidise will open up a vast new market.' </p> <p>He will also be electroforming replicas of trophies for Henley Royal Regatta which each year's winners can take away and keep. 'It's more accurate than casting,' he says, 'and quicker than chasing lotus leaves by hand.' </p> <p>The doyen of silversmiths, Benney, of west London, sells handmade silver boxes for pills, jewellery or cigars; they have electroformed plates with geometric designs inserted in the lids. </p> <p>A 1.5 inch diameter pillbox with electroformed lid that might have sold for \u00a31,000 if entirely hand-made, sells for \u00a3300. An 8in-by-6in cigar box, 3in deep, is \u00a32,000 rather than \u00a36,000. </p> <p>Benney says: 'They're amazingly detailed. This is an affordable way of repeating pieces without losing definition in the decoration.' </p> <p>Ironically, between 1980 and 1985 the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths spent a reputed \u00a3250,000 on research at Birmingham University to find a silver alloy that would not tarnish. It was a case of 'so near, yet so far'. At the time, the company was wedded to developing a silver plating to combat tarnish, on sterling wares and on lower-grade silver alloys. </p> <p>Dr Peter Farr, then a senior lecturer in metallurgy at Birmingham University, followed the company's brief, only to conclude that germanium, among other metals, was unsuitable for the plating process. </p> <p>He says: 'If the results of sovereign sterling silver are as good as they sound, I'd be delighted.

      "bodyText": "Take a close look at silversmith Richard Fox's candle holder which is on display from Tuesday at the six-day Olympia Spring Fine Art and Antiques Fair. It has been on show around the country for about two years, and has never been polished - yet it is completely free of tarnish. The candle holder is made from a newly discovered tarnish-resistant alloy, sovereign sterling silver, which Fox hails as the most significant development in silversmithing for more than 1,000 years. The silver industry's search for a tarnish-resistant silver has recently acquired an intensity akin to the age-old quest to turn base metals into gold, because younger people too busy to spit-and-polish have been buying stainless steel tableware instead. The secret of sovereign silver, which will soon have its own hallmark and logo, is the addition of 1.1 per cent of the chemical element germanium (Ge), a silvery-grey metalloid with a crystalline structure that resembles diamonds. Germanium absorbs, without trace, the oxygen that causes tarnish. The alloy is also dishwasher-friendly. If you own a silver Post-It note holder that uncannily refuses to lose its lustre, you probably have one of the first sovereign silver products to hit the high street. Made by Fox, these have just sold out at the John Lewis store chain in sizes ranging in price from \u00a375 to \u00a3105, no more than for standard sterling silver. If the Cold War had not ended, the new silver might never have been discovered. Germanium is used in the infrared heat-seeking lenses used on both Russian and US tanks. After communism collapsed, the French mining company that extracts it from zinc and lead ores, Metaleurop, was forced to seek new uses for it. The company telephoned Peter Johns, a silversmith and tutor in applied arts at Middlesex University. Sovereign sterling silver is his discovery. Johns is a freeman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, whose apprentice masterpiece is Canterbury Cathedral's silver processional cross. But he has no training as a metallurgist. He says: 'Metaleurop was looking for any new use for germanium. Because Middlesex Polytechnic, as it then was, had a name for working with a range of metals, they thought we would be open to their crazy idea of a new silver alloy. 'This discovery would never have come from a straight metallurgist, because they don't know what the industry wants. I can arrive at solutions more quickly.' The invention coincides with another leap forward in silversmithing: the revival of electroforming - forming a solid silver object by the familiar electroplating process, using a mould immersed in a tank containing silver salts with an electric current running through it. Computerisation and other refinements mean the deposited silver can now accurately replicate fine detail, even engraving. Electroforming was the process used by the London company BJS to make the coronet for Prince Charles's inauguration as Prince of Wales in 1969. BJS is now being commissioned to make silver copies of pieces by craftsmen designers who, only a year or two ago, would have scorned the idea of having copies made. Electroformed silverware costs a third to a half the price of the hand-crafted variety. The first electroform using sovereign silver has yet to be made. But a fusion of the two new methods, combined with designs by contemporary silversmiths of the kind on show at Olympia, could breathe new life into a product that has become unfashionable. Johns has just been granted a European patent for sovereign silver - having beaten an Australian challenger - and is going for an American patent. The new silver is already popular in Finland, Italy and the US. Licence fees could earn him millions. According to a research paper published by Johns, the new silver resists not only the tarnish of time but 'firestain', the grey tarnish that forms on sterling silver when the heat of soldering forces oxygen into it. The silver itself does not oxidise in heat, but the copper, added to give the alloy strength, does. Hence the tarnish. Apart from that 1.1 per cent germanium, the new alloy is little different from Sterling's 925 parts of silver plus 75 parts of copper and zinc. Germanium also adds ductility - the ability to stretch without breaking - so the silver needs less heating and plunging when it is being worked. It is stronger, too, bringing the hope of bigger, more spectacular silverware. Johns says: 'This is the silver that is going to be used for the next 5,000 years. I have ambitious plans to market it, but what I really like is the thought that I'm going to leave to the world something of beauty.' Silversmith Martin Pugh, famous for his cutlery - his butter dish and forks are in the 10 Downing Street Collection and his claret jug in the Millennium Collection - has experimented with the new silver. 'You have to change your craft technique a little, but you don't have to clean off firestain and, once made, the tarnish rate is vastly slower - if it exists at all,' he says. Meanwhile, Fox is turning over his entire production to the new alloy. That will include trophies for the Formula 1 world motor racing championship, domestic wares such as his three-piece tea service (\u00a33,000, only \u00a350 more than ordinary sterling silver might have cost), glasses with silver bases at \u00a360 each, and cutlery. 'The last thing you want is to have to polish all the cutlery before a dinner party,' he says, 'so silver that won't oxidise will open up a vast new market.' He will also be electroforming replicas of trophies for Henley Royal Regatta which each year's winners can take away and keep. 'It's more accurate than casting,' he says, 'and quicker than chasing lotus leaves by hand.' The doyen of silversmiths, Benney, of west London, sells handmade silver boxes for pills, jewellery or cigars; they have electroformed plates with geometric designs inserted in the lids. A 1.5 inch diameter pillbox with electroformed lid that might have sold for \u00a31,000 if entirely hand-made, sells for \u00a3300. An 8in-by-6in cigar box, 3in deep, is \u00a32,000 rather than \u00a36,000. Benney says: 'They're amazingly detailed. This is an affordable way of repeating pieces without losing definition in the decoration.' Ironically, between 1980 and 1985 the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths spent a reputed \u00a3250,000 on research at Birmingham University to find a silver alloy that would not tarnish. It was a case of 'so near, yet so far'. At the time, the company was wedded to developing a silver plating to combat tarnish, on sterling wares and on lower-grade silver alloys. Dr Peter Farr, then a senior lecturer in metallurgy at Birmingham University, followed the company's brief, only to conclude that germanium, among other metals, was unsuitable for the plating process. He says: 'If the results of sovereign sterling silver are as good as they sound, I'd be delighted. The technology of electroplating has moved on since the Eighties: a germanium silver plate may now be possible.' The new tarnish-free silver could, however, make a separate plating process unnecessary. Could germanium silver be electroformed? Farr, now president of the Institute of Metal Finishing, says: 'Electroforming could well incorporate Johns' invention.' \u0095 The Olympia fair is open between 5pm and 10pm on Tuesday, on Wednesday (11am-9pm), Thursday and Friday (11am-8pm), Saturday (11am-7pm) and Sunday (11am-5pm).

We asked three independent financial advisers to devise an investment plan for a \u00a350,000 lump sum with the aim of producing income for someone about to retire.

'However, to provide for some capital appreciation we have proposed a \u00a310,000 investment in an equity income fund which will dampen yield prospects in year one but lead to rising income in future years,' he says. </p> <p>Most of the bonds in his selection of funds are investment-grade securities - government bonds or bonds issued by the most financially solid of companies. But to boost the yield, he has added some exposure to the expanding high-yield sector. He did this by using the \u00a37,000 Isa allowance to invest in the M&amp;G High Yield Corporate Bond Isa. High-yield corporate bonds are issued by companies which have a low - or no - credit rating but pay bondholders more for taking on some extra risk. Hollands has also included a 'small play' in investment trust income shares. </p> <p><strong> Kim North of Calkin Pattinson, </strong> based in London, has chosen both income and growth elements for her income portfolio, assuming the investor wants income to supplement a pension, but also needs to protect the capital value. Only one of the four funds she has chosen aims to produce a high yield on the level expected from corporate bonds. While the other three aim for yields on the level of share dividends, they tend to be higher than those paid out by most large companies in the UK. At present, the average dividend paid by companies in the FTSE 100 index is 2.2 per cent a year. </p> <p>For the \u00a37,000 Isa allowance, she suggests the Perpetual Monthly Income Isa, designed to provide a yield of more than 8 per cent. 'This is achieved through investment in a range of fixed-interest securities, including corporate and government bonds,' she says. It also tries to protect capital and provide some growth, she adds. </p> <p>She is also going for the HSBC UK Growth &amp; Income fund, which is relatively conservative in style, and the Invesco GT Income fund, which invests mainly in growth situations where the share is not too highly valued and where dividend payouts are above average. Her fourth choice, the ABN AMRO Equity Income fund, is not restricted to particular countries or sectors, but is likely to keep a high weighting in the UK. </p> <p><strong> Stephen Dight of Grosvenor Financial Services </strong> in Henley-on-Thames has chosen the Rothschild Private Portfolio Service, leaving the selection of funds to a professional fund manager. </p> <p>'I particularly like the Rothschild approach because they know and develop personal relationships with the individual fund managers and their teams,' he says. He points out that if a fund manager were to leave a company, it could have a marked effect on future performance, but Rothschild would be capable of adjusting the portfolio to take that into account. </p> <p>To make use of the investor's annual Isa allowance, Dight has suggested investing \u00a37,000 in the Five Arrows Independent Income Fund, also managed by Rothschilds. </p> <p>Assuming the investor is a basic-rate taxpayer who does not make use of his annual capital gains tax allowance, Dight suggests putting half of the \u00a350,000 into growth-generating funds, feeding \u00a37,000 into the Income Isa gradually each year so that the income becomes tax-free. The other half is split between the UK Capital Growth Strategy and the International Capital Growth Strategy. </p> <p>Dight says: 'If you are paying income tax and are not using your capital gains allowance, you may as well invest in funds that generate capital growth, and simply cash in units when you need some money. These can be offset against your CGT allowance.'</p>",

Jason Hollands of Best Investment assumed all-out income was the objective, so invested most of the portfolio in fixed-interest investments such as bonds and preference shares. 'However, to provide for some capital appreciation we have proposed a \u00a310,000 investment in an equity income fund which will dampen yield prospects in year one but lead to rising income in future years,' he says. Most of the bonds in his selection of funds are investment-grade securities - government bonds or bonds issued by the most financially solid of companies. But to boost the yield, he has added some exposure to the expanding high-yield sector. He did this by using the \u00a37,000 Isa allowance to invest in the M&amp;G High Yield Corporate Bond Isa. High-yield corporate bonds are issued by companies which have a low - or no - credit rating but pay bondholders more for taking on some extra risk. Hollands has also included a 'small play' in investment trust income shares. Kim North of Calkin Pattinson, based in London, has chosen both income and growth elements for her income portfolio, assuming the investor wants income to supplement a pension, but also needs to protect the capital value. Only one of the four funds she has chosen aims to produce a high yield on the level expected from corporate bonds. While the other three aim for yields on the level of share dividends, they tend to be higher than those paid out by most large companies in the UK. At present, the average dividend paid by companies in the FTSE 100 index is 2.2 per cent a year. For the \u00a37,000 Isa allowance, she suggests the Perpetual Monthly Income Isa, designed to provide a yield of more than 8 per cent. 'This is achieved through investment in a range of fixed-interest securities, including corporate and government bonds,' she says. It also tries to protect capital and provide some growth, she adds. She is also going for the HSBC UK Growth &amp; Income fund, which is relatively conservative in style, and the Invesco GT Income fund, which invests mainly in growth situations where the share is not too highly valued and where dividend payouts are above average. Her fourth choice, the ABN AMRO Equity Income fund, is not restricted to particular countries or sectors, but is likely to keep a high weighting in the UK. Stephen Dight of Grosvenor Financial Services in Henley-on-Thames has chosen the Rothschild Private Portfolio Service, leaving the selection of funds to a professional fund manager. 'I particularly like the Rothschild approach because they know and develop personal relationships with the individual fund managers and their teams,' he says. He points out that if a fund manager were to leave a company, it could have a marked effect on future performance, but Rothschild would be capable of adjusting the portfolio to take that into account. To make use of the investor's annual Isa allowance, Dight has suggested investing \u00a37,000 in the Five Arrows Independent Income Fund, also managed by Rothschilds. Assuming the investor is a basic-rate taxpayer who does not make use of his annual capital gains tax allowance, Dight suggests putting half of the \u00a350,000 into growth-generating funds, feeding \u00a37,000 into the Income Isa gradually each year so that the income becomes tax-free. The other half is split between the UK Capital Growth Strategy and the International Capital Growth Strategy. Dight says: 'If you are paying income tax and are not using your capital gains allowance, you may as well invest in funds that generate capital growth, and simply cash in units when you need some money. These can be offset against your CGT allowance.'",

But given the terrible publicity that has surrounded personal pensions, savers to whom an occupational plan is not available can be forgiven for considering other options. </p> <p>In particular, an individual savings account (Isa) offers similar tax reliefs to personal pensions. In the current tax year, everyone can invest up to \u00a37,000 through an Isa, with income and gains accruing virtually free of tax. And though the annual Isa allowance falls to \u00a35,000 from the 2000-01 tax year onwards, this will still allow long-term savers to build up a sizable tax-free fund. </p> <p>Those who can afford to should, of course, use both pensions and Isas, but many savers will have to make a choice. And while there is no right or wrong decision, it is important that you understand the issues at stake. </p> <p>The first of these is tax. Here, the contest is finely balanced. Personal pension investors get relief at their highest marginal tax rate on contributions, so basic and higher-rate taxpayers pay just \u00a377 and \u00a360 respectively to make a pension investment of \u00a3100. Isa investors do not get tax relief on their contributions but they do not pay tax when they cash in their savings. In effect, personal pension and Isa investors get the same tax reliefs, but at different times. </p> <p>For now at least, though, Isa investors do get a slightly better deal on the tax treatment of some investments. All income and capital gains on investments held in both personal pensions and Isas are tax free. </p> <p>Dividends from UK equities are effectively paid with 20 per cent income tax deducted at source and, until recently, non-taxpayers such as Isa and pension investors were allowed to reclaim this money. But last April this reclaimable credit was abolished - except for Isa investors, who can still claim a 10 per cent credit on dividends until April 2004. </p> <p>However, this is not as big an advantage as it seems. For one thing, Isa investors will be in the same position as those with personal pensions from April 2004. Also, the tax benefit applies only to UK equities; investors can use Isas and personal pensions to hold many types of asset. </p> <p>In any case, says John Turton, head of life and pensions at independent financial adviser Best Investments, higher fees on Isas cancel out the tiny tax credit advantage, unless you are investing in high-yielding UK equities. </p> <p>Moreover, personal pensions have an additional tax break that trumps Isas' small tax credit gain. On retirement, investors can take up to 25 per cent of their personal pension fund as a tax-free cash lump sum. On this part of the fund, they effectively receive tax relief on both their contributions and their benefits - a break with which Isas cannot compete. </p> <p>On this basis personal pensions are slightly more tax-efficient than Isas. They are even more so for anyone who is a higher-rate taxpayer while working but becomes a basic-rate taxpayer in retirement: they will get a better deal from the upfront relief that personal pensions offer. </p> <p>However, tax is not the only factor to consider. 'The vast array of investment opportunities on offer through Isas tips the balance in their favour,' argues Roddy Kohn, principal of independent financial adviser Kohn Cougar. </p> <p>He points out that while personal pension and Isa investors are, in theory, allowed to invest in a similar range of assets, Isa investors have more choice in practice. Very few personal pension managers offer more than a handful of funds, but through an Isa investors have access to around 1,500. </p> <p>Younger investors, in particular, will benefit from these extra options because they can afford to take a longer-term, more aggressive investment stance. 'The extra returns which an investment in a fund with good stock-picking can generate could, over the long term, outstrip the edge that personal pensions have on tax efficiency,' says Kohn. </p> <p>Isas are also more flexible. Subject to yearly allowances, you can invest and withdraw at will. But you cannot reclaim pension contributions until retirement. And most personal pensions levy high charges on savers who want to reduce or stop contributing to their plans for a period. </p> <p>Some investors will benefit from the rigidity of pensions - the great danger of an Isa is that because it is so easy to withdraw money, you will be tempted to do so regularly. Any withdrawals leave you with a smaller fund to finance your old age. </p> <p>Turton reiterates that all investors should try to save using both pensions and Isas. However, he says that if you have to choose, based on the current system, it makes sense to opt for a personal pension rather than an Isa, unless you are likely to need access to savings before retirement. </p> <p>However, he says investors in occupational pension schemes who want to top up savings through an additional voluntary contributions plan (AVC) would be much better doing so through an Isa.

Christine Farnish, director of consumer relations at the FSA, said: 'Many consumers don't understand that charges may be deducted from their capital, rather than taken from income.' </p> <p>The FSA has a factsheet, High-Income Products: Make sure you understand the risks, available by calling 0800 917 3311. </p> <p><strong> Nanny cleans up</strong><br> </p> <p> If you are wondering whether you are paying your nanny enough, a survey by Nannytax, an organisation that provides payroll services for employers of nannies, has the answer. </p> <p>Nannytax's survey, published in The Professional Nanny magazine, shows that after-tax pay for daily nannies in central London has increased by 10 per cent, to \u00a3289 per week, over the past year. In outer London and the home counties average wages went up by 8 per cent to \u00a3230, net of tax. For live-in nannies the increases were 7 per cent, to \u00a3214, and 11 per cent, to \u00a3185, respectively. </p> <p>Elsewhere, daily nannies have seen their wages rise by 17.5 per cent to \u00a3196 and 15.5 per cent to \u00a3188 net. Live-in colleagues in the same areas saw increases of 21.5 per cent, to \u00a3169 and 18 per cent to \u00a3163. </p> <p><strong> Payback time</strong><br> </p> <p> A deadline is looming for victims of the pensions mis-selling scandal. Anyone who thinks that they may have been mis-sold a personal pension between 1988 and 1994 has until 31 March to return a form to their pension company asking for a review of their case. Companies have sent mailings to individuals who may be affected. Those who have not received a letter, or have mislaid the information but think they are affected, should contact the company that sold them the pension. </p> <p>The pensions mis-selling occurred where an insurer sold a personal pension to someone who should have stayed in, or joined, an employer's scheme. Compensation of up to \u00a34,000 or more may now be payable. </p> <p> FSA helpline: 0800 003 007. </p> <p><strong> Branching out</strong><br> </p> <p> Under pressure from consumer lobbyists and customers, banks are beginning to respond to criticism of branch closures. On 16 March, Barclays begins a pilot scheme in Cornwall, providing banking services through post offices. Customers will be able to cash cheques to an agreed limit, and deposit cash and cheques. If the pilot is successful, the service may be extended to post offices throughout the country. </p> <p><strong> Cat's whiskers</strong><br> </p> <p> Lenders are beginning to launch mortgages that meet government standards for charges and terms. The so-called Cat standard loans cannot charge more than 2 per cent over base rate currently 6 per cent. Also, redemption penalties are capped at certain levels, and interest must be calculated daily. Yorkshire Building Society has a variable-rate Cat standard loan, currently at 6.5 per cent, although this is likely to increase following the latest base-rate rise. Yorkshire is planning to peg the rate at a certain margin above base rate. Hinckley and Rugby building society has a variable rate Cat loan . For loans up to 80 per cent, there is 10 per cent reduc tion off the standard variable rate, and for loans up to 90 per cent, a 5 per cent reduction. </p> <p><strong> Spend it on Sony</strong><br> </p> <p> Gadget fans and groupies may be attracted to the SonyCard, a credit card that entitles holders to discounts off Sony products.

      "bodyText": "Take charge of your Isa income Anyone considering investing in a high-income Isa should look carefully at how charges are deducted, the Financial Services Authority has warned. The chief financial watchdog announced last week that research conducted among income investors showed that many did not understand that charges may be deducted from their capital, rather than taken from income. This method flatters income, but can underplay erosion of capital. Christine Farnish, director of consumer relations at the FSA, said: 'Many consumers don't understand that charges may be deducted from their capital, rather than taken from income.' The FSA has a factsheet, High-Income Products: Make sure you understand the risks, available by calling 0800 917 3311. Nanny cleans up If you are wondering whether you are paying your nanny enough, a survey by Nannytax, an organisation that provides payroll services for employers of nannies, has the answer. Nannytax's survey, published in The Professional Nanny magazine, shows that after-tax pay for daily nannies in central London has increased by 10 per cent, to \u00a3289 per week, over the past year. In outer London and the home counties average wages went up by 8 per cent to \u00a3230, net of tax. For live-in nannies the increases were 7 per cent, to \u00a3214, and 11 per cent, to \u00a3185, respectively. Elsewhere, daily nannies have seen their wages rise by 17.5 per cent to \u00a3196 and 15.5 per cent to \u00a3188 net. Live-in colleagues in the same areas saw increases of 21.5 per cent, to \u00a3169 and 18 per cent to \u00a3163. Payback time A deadline is looming for victims of the pensions mis-selling scandal. Anyone who thinks that they may have been mis-sold a personal pension between 1988 and 1994 has until 31 March to return a form to their pension company asking for a review of their case. Companies have sent mailings to individuals who may be affected. Those who have not received a letter, or have mislaid the information but think they are affected, should contact the company that sold them the pension. The pensions mis-selling occurred where an insurer sold a personal pension to someone who should have stayed in, or joined, an employer's scheme. Compensation of up to \u00a34,000 or more may now be payable. FSA helpline: 0800 003 007. Branching out Under pressure from consumer lobbyists and customers, banks are beginning to respond to criticism of branch closures. On 16 March, Barclays begins a pilot scheme in Cornwall, providing banking services through post offices. Customers will be able to cash cheques to an agreed limit, and deposit cash and cheques. If the pilot is successful, the service may be extended to post offices throughout the country. Cat's whiskers Lenders are beginning to launch mortgages that meet government standards for charges and terms. The so-called Cat standard loans cannot charge more than 2 per cent over base rate currently 6 per cent. Also, redemption penalties are capped at certain levels, and interest must be calculated daily. Yorkshire Building Society has a variable-rate Cat standard loan, currently at 6.5 per cent, although this is likely to increase following the latest base-rate rise. Yorkshire is planning to peg the rate at a certain margin above base rate. Hinckley and Rugby building society has a variable rate Cat loan . For loans up to 80 per cent, there is 10 per cent reduc tion off the standard variable rate, and for loans up to 90 per cent, a 5 per cent reduction.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The atmosphere was fraught when Fokko van Duyne, joint chief executive of Corus, stepped into the riverside Cholmondeley Room at the House of Lords 11 days ago. </p> <p>Just 24 hours earlier, the Dutchman had sent shudders through Britain's steel heartlands. Corus, the renamed British Steel, had already announced one surprise UK closure, at Shelton Bar in Stoke-on-Trent, since its \u00a34 billion merger with Dutch rival Hoogovens last autumn. The British side had lost \u00a3167m in the six months to last September. And further UK cutbacks were inevitable, van Duyne warned, if the pound's strength continued to price the world's third- largest steelmaker out of its major European markets. </p> <p>The Westminster reception was the first time the 70-strong Steel Group of MPs had met the new face at the top since the merger in October. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott was there to hear the bleak message about sterling's effect on the UK's 'old' manufacturing and export economy. </p> <p>'Fokko van Duyne came over as a plain speaker who is alarmed that half his company has to sell steel products in an overvalued currency,' said Denis MacShane, MP for Rotherham and chair of the parliamentary steel group. </p> <p>The Dutchman's remarks revived worries over the future of the Llanwern steelworks and its 3,500 workers in South Wales. Now, as then, Corus soothed union fears. </p> <p>'The pound has risen 40 per cent against the German mark. If it remains like that, in the longer term we will have to look at locations,' a Corus spokesman said. 'But we are not saying we have drawn up a hit list.' </p> <p>But The Observer has established that Llanwern is very much at risk - and concerns run far wider. The bigger works, on Teesside, which employs 4,000, may also be vulnerable. And there are rumblings over Ebbw Vale, one of two tinplate plants in South Wales, which employs more than 1,500 people. </p> <p>In Corus-speak, 'long term' may mean this autumn. Van Duyne said any steps he may be forced to take 'would become clearer in the course of the year'. And insiders confirm that the first anniversary of the merger - 1 October - is a target date to explain future strategy. </p> <p>By then, key planks of Corus's plans should be in place. First, a new mill at Hoogovens' giant Dutch works at Ijmuiden will be almost fully operational, adding around 1.2 million tonnes of low-cost, euro-denominated steel output. </p> <p>But the mill can also take a second new production line of up to 800,000 tonnes. And although Corus says it has no plans for this, industry watchers say that, behind the scenes, it is already committed to further Dutch expansion. 'I believe they've already decided in principle to install that second line,' said one steel analyst. </p> <p>The repercussions for South Wales may be severe. The Observer first highlighted fears about Llanwern before the merger. Like Ijmuiden, Llanwern makes strip steel. But unlike the neighbouring Port Talbot works, which also makes strip, Llanwern does not have a deep-water port. </p> <p>'It doesn't take a genius to work out what might happen,' one senior industry insider said. </p> <p>On 29 February, Mick Leahy, leader of the ISTC steel union, will head a delegation to Corus's London headquarters seeking answers. 'Prior to the merger, we were assured that the current plant configuration would stay. We want them to keep their promises,' he said. </p> <p>On Corus's recent form, he is unlikely to gain much comfort. The ISTC should also ask about the firm's intentions in Poland. For months, Corus has been talking to the Polish government about the privatisation of the giant steel works at Huta Katowice. Corus is the favoured buyer, but has baulked at investing \u00a3300m in a new casting line. </p> <p>Katowice already has mod ern, low-cost plant at the heart of Europe, and turns out heavy products similar to those made by Corus's biggest works, at Scunthorpe and Teesside. Teesside, with its older furnace, is seen as the more vulnerable. </p> <p>But South Wales, too, may be affected. So far, Corus has publicly eschewed any desire for Katowice's strip steel operations, in which Italy's Danielli has expressed interest. Corus insiders, however, say it is asking for reassurances on the future of the strip activities of Huta Sendzimira, Poland's second biggest works. </p> <p>That makes sense, analysts say, only if it is indeed interested in Polish strip. And that may affect Llanwern. </p> <p>'Corus is already touting a map of its main markets to Ministers - a triangle from Madrid in the West, Rome in the South and Szczecin on the Polish-German border in the East,' one UK government source said. 'And just 100km outside that triangle is Katowice, with cheap labour, no pound and lower transport costs.

      "bodyText": "The atmosphere was fraught when Fokko van Duyne, joint chief executive of Corus, stepped into the riverside Cholmondeley Room at the House of Lords 11 days ago. Just 24 hours earlier, the Dutchman had sent shudders through Britain's steel heartlands. Corus, the renamed British Steel, had already announced one surprise UK closure, at Shelton Bar in Stoke-on-Trent, since its \u00a34 billion merger with Dutch rival Hoogovens last autumn. The British side had lost \u00a3167m in the six months to last September. And further UK cutbacks were inevitable, van Duyne warned, if the pound's strength continued to price the world's third- largest steelmaker out of its major European markets. The Westminster reception was the first time the 70-strong Steel Group of MPs had met the new face at the top since the merger in October. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott was there to hear the bleak message about sterling's effect on the UK's 'old' manufacturing and export economy. 'Fokko van Duyne came over as a plain speaker who is alarmed that half his company has to sell steel products in an overvalued currency,' said Denis MacShane, MP for Rotherham and chair of the parliamentary steel group. The Dutchman's remarks revived worries over the future of the Llanwern steelworks and its 3,500 workers in South Wales. Now, as then, Corus soothed union fears. 'The pound has risen 40 per cent against the German mark. If it remains like that, in the longer term we will have to look at locations,' a Corus spokesman said. 'But we are not saying we have drawn up a hit list.' But The Observer has established that Llanwern is very much at risk - and concerns run far wider. The bigger works, on Teesside, which employs 4,000, may also be vulnerable. And there are rumblings over Ebbw Vale, one of two tinplate plants in South Wales, which employs more than 1,500 people. In Corus-speak, 'long term' may mean this autumn. Van Duyne said any steps he may be forced to take 'would become clearer in the course of the year'. And insiders confirm that the first anniversary of the merger - 1 October - is a target date to explain future strategy. By then, key planks of Corus's plans should be in place. First, a new mill at Hoogovens' giant Dutch works at Ijmuiden will be almost fully operational, adding around 1.2 million tonnes of low-cost, euro-denominated steel output. But the mill can also take a second new production line of up to 800,000 tonnes. And although Corus says it has no plans for this, industry watchers say that, behind the scenes, it is already committed to further Dutch expansion. 'I believe they've already decided in principle to install that second line,' said one steel analyst. The repercussions for South Wales may be severe. The Observer first highlighted fears about Llanwern before the merger. Like Ijmuiden, Llanwern makes strip steel. But unlike the neighbouring Port Talbot works, which also makes strip, Llanwern does not have a deep-water port. 'It doesn't take a genius to work out what might happen,' one senior industry insider said. On 29 February, Mick Leahy, leader of the ISTC steel union, will head a delegation to Corus's London headquarters seeking answers. 'Prior to the merger, we were assured that the current plant configuration would stay. We want them to keep their promises,' he said. On Corus's recent form, he is unlikely to gain much comfort. The ISTC should also ask about the firm's intentions in Poland. For months, Corus has been talking to the Polish government about the privatisation of the giant steel works at Huta Katowice. Corus is the favoured buyer, but has baulked at investing \u00a3300m in a new casting line. Katowice already has mod ern, low-cost plant at the heart of Europe, and turns out heavy products similar to those made by Corus's biggest works, at Scunthorpe and Teesside. Teesside, with its older furnace, is seen as the more vulnerable. But South Wales, too, may be affected. So far, Corus has publicly eschewed any desire for Katowice's strip steel operations, in which Italy's Danielli has expressed interest. Corus insiders, however, say it is asking for reassurances on the future of the strip activities of Huta Sendzimira, Poland's second biggest works. That makes sense, analysts say, only if it is indeed interested in Polish strip. And that may affect Llanwern. 'Corus is already touting a map of its main markets to Ministers - a triangle from Madrid in the West, Rome in the South and Szczecin on the Polish-German border in the East,' one UK government source said. 'And just 100km outside that triangle is Katowice, with cheap labour, no pound and lower transport costs. We should be worried.' Ironically, it is the Dutch who have borne the brunt of the cuts so far. Unions there have threatened to strike over the loss of 600 jobs at Ijmuiden. Cynics, indeed, believe that Shelton Bar was shut to temper Dutch anger. That, in itself, points to a deeper issue: that Corus is still being run as two separate national flagships. When the ISTC delegation troops in a week on Tuesday, however, the union and steel MPs hope the consensual continental style of industrial relations will prevail. 'We all hope the Dutch approach to consultation and dialogue will become the norm for Corus UK,' said MacShane.",

Courtaulds will be barely a mouthful for it. For a firm whose adverts have featured a bevy of catwalk models, including Eva Herzigova (the 'Hello Boys' campaign), Sara Lee is no slave to corporate fashion. </p> <p>To the frustration of the City and Wall Street break-up merchants, the Nineties vogue for 'focus, focus, focus' left Sara Lee cold: as it has relentlessly added everything from hot dogs to hosiery to its trademark US frozen foods. </p> <p>The brand began in 1935, when founder Charles Lubin opened a chain of bakery shops in Chicago. Fourteen years later, the firm moved into mass market manufacturing, and Lubin named its first product, a cream cheesecake, after his eight-year-old daughter. Today the original Sara Lee is a 59-year-old grandmother. </p> <p>In 1956, the then Kitchens of Sara Lee was acquired by Consolidated Foods Corporation, a rapacious conglomerate founded on the eve of the Second World War by ambitious Canadian entrepreneur Nathan Cummings. </p> <p>Consolidated's roots lay in tea, coffee and sugar merchanting on the US east coast, but after snapping up Sara Lee, it rapidly expanded overseas and diversified into a rag-bag of activities from door-to-door jewellery and cosmetics to Venezuelan vinegar and a supermarket chain with the unlikely name of Piggly Wiggly. </p> <p>The Sara Lee of today was forged by John H Bryan, one of the longest-serving chiefs of a Fortune 100 company. He steps down in July after a quarter of a century at the helm. In 1978, under Bryan, the group acquired Douwe Egberts, now the third-largest coffee roaster in the world. Kiwi shoe polish - the group's biggest global brand - was snapped up in 1984, joining Radox and Vapona fly spray in the group's growing stable of household and personal care operations. </p> <p>A year later, Bryan dropped the Consolidated Food tag in favour of Sara Lee, before buying into the premier league of lingerie in 1991 with Playtex - the number one mass market bra-brand, established in the UK in 1965. </p> <p>Today, Sara Lee sells \u00a3300m of products in Britain every year, including Body Mist, Brylcreem and Badedas. It is the world's biggest packaged meats firm and, with ads featuring basketball superstar Michael Jordan, the top hot dog seller in the US. Its Pickwick teas lead in six countries on the continent. </p> <p>Forty per cent of sales and nearly half of profits come from overseas, and more than 30 of the group's brands each notch up worldwide sales over $100m a year. </p> <p>It is in everyday lingerie, however, that Sara Lee could carve out its biggest market position - thanks to a the combination with Courtaulds. The group's apparel division - which specialises in underwear, stockings and tights - accounts for $7.5bn of sales a year. Sara Lee's top US underwear brand, Hanes, has a turnover of $2.5bn - two- thirds greater than Courtaulds' total $1.5bn of sales. The Playtex, Berlei and Gossard brands, plus Courtaulds' position as a leading supplier to Marks &amp; Spencer, mean the group would command more than half of the British bra market. </p> <p>In hosiery, in the UK and in France, the dominance would be even greater. Analysts estimate that combining Sara Lee's Pretty Polly and the Dim brand in France with Courtaulds' Aristoc would give the new group around two-thirds of the market for branded tights and stockings. </p> <p>This weekend, Courtaulds is hoping competition concerns will blunt the ambitions of its US suitor. However, Sara Lee and its adviser, Goldman Sachs, are, industry sources say, unlikely to have launched their bid without first taking soundings from the regulators. And the strength of the high street retailers' own-label lingerie and unbranded tights, means there are unlikely to be too many regulatory worries. </p> <p>'From a UK or French standpoint, the combined market shares in lingerie could warrant attention from national competition regulators,' says analyst Ron McDerment of broker HSBC Securities. 'However, the size of the total deal means that it formally falls to Brussels to consider competition issues, and from a broader European perspective there is unlikely to be concern.' </p> <p>The two firms are also intimately linked. Sara Lee is the largest customer for Courtaulds' fabrics division. And Gossard held the licence for the Wonderbra until 1994 when Playtex took it back. Since then, Courtaulds has successfully introduced its own Ultrabra here, on the continent and through the leading Victoria's Secrets lingerie chain in the US. </p> <p>The fierce rivalry, racy ads and column inches of cleavage are reckoned to have increased the size of the branded bra market since.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is about to lose one of its most colourful characters. Since the MPC's inception in June 1997, Professor Willem Buiter, 50, has been a star turn, both within and outside the hallowed portals of Threadneedle Street. </p> <p>Behind Gordon Brown's surprise decision to set up the MPC, with its four 'outsiders', lay a desire to shake up the Bank and make it a less monolithic institution. Brown's team thought the Bank was too inbred. While desperate to win the trust of the financial world by granting independence to the Bank, New Labour did not want 'credibility' to be gained at the cost of submission to what are known in the trade as 'inflation nutters'. </p> <p>Buiter arrived with a formidable academic reputation: in addition to being Professor of International Macroeconomics at Cambridge, he had done time at Princeton, Yale and the London School of Economics. The published works he presented to the Treasury Committee at his confirmation hearing called to mind Leporello's list of Don Giovanni's conquests. </p> <p>Buiter quickly became known as a hawk, but closer observers preferred to describe him as an activist. His penchant for appearing to favour bigger, or smaller, changes in interest rates than the others, and his outspokenness inside and outside the Bank, gained him a reputation as a maverick. </p> <p>Buiter was relaxed about his putative volatility: he would cite Harold Macmillan to explain changes of mind: 'Events, dear boy, events!' </p> <p>His judgment on the big issues has been impressive: he was quick to spot the need for the MPC to change tack in the autumn of 1998 when its earlier rate rises threatened to throw the economy into recession; at one stage he was proposing rate changes of only an eighth; more recently he would have preferred to lift rates more swiftly than drag out the agony with succesive quarter-point increases. </p> <p>Buiter has relished the challenge of relating the needs of the real economy to the financial variables on which the Bank concentrates. His fondness for straight talking and his distaste for the wiles of bureaucracy have at times stretched the patience of Bank colleagues. </p> <p>But he has made a powerful contribution to the perceived success of the MPC so far, and will be a huge loss. It is a consolation that he is unstinting in his praise for his successor, the labour market economist Steve Nickell. </p> <p>In an interview last week Buiter explained his decision to leave a job that 'has been great fun and I'll really miss'. He strongly believes that outside MPC members should serve only one term, because there must be a threat to their independence of judgment 'from even the appearance that they might want to ingratiate themselves with the powers that be' in the hope of reappointment. </p> <p>He told Eddie George last December that he would not seek reappointment when his three-year term expired at the end of May this year. But he believes that, in economic terms, the current three-year term is 'on the short side to accumulate and amortise your MPC human capital'. He believes 'a single term of up to five or six years might be ideal'. </p> <p>Apart from this, Buiter is full of praise for the MPC system, which he compares favourably not only with the European Central Bank but also the revered US Federal Reserve. A passionate European, and 'euro' man, Buiter has frequently criticised the ECB for its lack of transparency and democratic accountability. He praises the symmetry of Gordon Brown's inflation target of 2.5 per cent - the point being that the MPC is obliged to take action to stimulate the economy if inflation threatens to fall below 2.5 per cent. </p> <p>'The ECB has an inflation target that dare not speak its name,' says Buiter. 'It aims at price stability, which it defines as not more than 2 per cent inflation and not less than zero. If that makes sense, they have an inflation target centred on 1 per cent. ' </p> <p>Buiter implies that the ECB's approach is excessively deflationary, whereas the higher UK target and the symmetrical approach 'has not proved an inflation nutter's target'. By contrast, a target of '2.5 per cent or less' (which the Bank is originally believed to have wanted) would have given the MPC less scope to aim at expansion. </p> <p>Buiter claims 'ours is better than the US arrangement. Authority truly lies with a committee, whereas the US system personalises things to a high degree.' He implied he did not share in the general adulation of Alan Greenspan. 'Being so dependent on the judgment and luck of a single individual is fine when the going is good - it is the same arrangement we had with Mr Burns [Fed chairman in the Seventies] before him.' </p> <p>This brought us to the US economy's amazing recent performance, and the question: will economic policymakers here benefit from the so-called New Economy associated with the information technology revolution? </p> <p>Buiter's view is that 'The New Economy has shown up, at least in the US, as a lower equilibrium unemployment rate and an increased sustainable growth of potential output. The US has a half to 1 per cent increase in its trend rate of growth. That's big. Even a half per cent increase in the sustainable growth rate means a lot more jam tomorrow.' He expects the benefits of the New Economy to cross the Atlantic 'with the usual time-lag' but warns 'it may not be as spectacular as in the US when it comes. </p> <p>'Technological progress doesn't come down as manna from heaven. It has to be embodied in people, equipment and processes. That requires time and money. The US has had very strong investment growth, whereas UK investment is modest if not subdued.' </p> <p>I asked him what the biggest surprise had been at the MPC. </p> <p>'The one constant is the strength of the pound. I think we are in a familiar but fearsome swamp of confidence factors, safe havens, herd behaviour and market psychology. It is both unwelcome and very surprising.' </p> <p>How does this affect his belief that we should join the euro? </p> <p>'The only thing crucial for UK entry is the parity at whch we join. To join when the pound is worth a kilo would be to make the mistake Mr Churchill made in going back to the gold standard at over four dollars. Given that a mutually acceptable parity can be agreed on, the arguments for joining from the economic stability point of view are overwhelming.' </p> <p>That may take some time. Meanwhile Profesor Buiter is personally going into Europe in a different sense, by becoming the chief economist to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, which focuses on the former Soviet bloc. </p> <p>'It has been fun here,' he says 'but in the end we have one target and one instrument. I shall now be dealing with the transformation of whole countries into market economies and open societies. It's the nicest millennium-related bonus one could have achieved.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>A week's tittering about the outbreak of 'bra wars' in the City may have diminished the apparent significance of Sara 'Playtex' Lee's hostile bid for Courtaulds 'Berlei' Textiles of the UK. </p> <p>But the solemn sculpture of Samuel Courtauld IV which stands in the Courtauld gallery on the Strand in London serves as a reminder of how far this one-time mainstay of British industry has fallen. </p> <p>The paintings inside are now worth far more than the \u00a3104 million offered for the once dominant player in the UK textile industry. </p> <p>The fact that Courtaulds is merely the latest proud name targeted by overseas predators, taking advantage of rock-bottom stock market valuations for unloved manufacturers, would be unlikely to console Samuel IV, or any of the Huguenot silk dynasty which first sought sanctuary in Britain in 1685. </p> <p>But if Samuel III, who founded Courtaulds in 1816 in Braintree, Essex, could reflect on events, perhaps the fact that would give him greatest unease is that his company became prey to a bid because a third of its value was wiped out in two years. </p> <p>Part of the problem has been the fraying of the textiles industry as a whole. But much of the decline represented the switching of investment to companies which did not even make profits, let alone anything else. </p> <p>Courtaulds originally grew not only because it made things, but because it made things that people wanted to wear. In Victorian times, it was black crepe; when this declined, it bought the rights to manufacture viscose artificial silk in 1904, starting a man-made fibre business which would see it through the twentieth century, with materials such as acrylic courtelle. </p> <p>In the Sixties and Seventies, the company diversified, building a new industrial materials division, including chemicals, paint and plastics.

      "bodyText": "A week's tittering about the outbreak of 'bra wars' in the City may have diminished the apparent significance of Sara 'Playtex' Lee's hostile bid for Courtaulds 'Berlei' Textiles of the UK. But the solemn sculpture of Samuel Courtauld IV which stands in the Courtauld gallery on the Strand in London serves as a reminder of how far this one-time mainstay of British industry has fallen. The paintings inside are now worth far more than the \u00a3104 million offered for the once dominant player in the UK textile industry. The fact that Courtaulds is merely the latest proud name targeted by overseas predators, taking advantage of rock-bottom stock market valuations for unloved manufacturers, would be unlikely to console Samuel IV, or any of the Huguenot silk dynasty which first sought sanctuary in Britain in 1685. But if Samuel III, who founded Courtaulds in 1816 in Braintree, Essex, could reflect on events, perhaps the fact that would give him greatest unease is that his company became prey to a bid because a third of its value was wiped out in two years. Part of the problem has been the fraying of the textiles industry as a whole. But much of the decline represented the switching of investment to companies which did not even make profits, let alone anything else. Courtaulds originally grew not only because it made things, but because it made things that people wanted to wear. In Victorian times, it was black crepe; when this declined, it bought the rights to manufacture viscose artificial silk in 1904, starting a man-made fibre business which would see it through the twentieth century, with materials such as acrylic courtelle. In the Sixties and Seventies, the company diversified, building a new industrial materials division, including chemicals, paint and plastics. In the Eighties, it bought lace and stretch fabric companies, before demerging the textiles business in 1990. Now Courtaulds Textiles has four divi sions - international fabrics, including lace, with \u00a3289m sales; lingerie and hosiery, including the Gossard and Berlei brands, which sell \u00a3333m; casual and other underwear accounting for \u00a3233m, which is Courtaulds main route to its chief customer, Marks &amp; Spencer; and furnishings, turning over \u00a364m. None of these are particularly bad when compared with their peers. So what's the problem? After all, Courtaulds is no stranger to adversity - ever-changing fashion has demanded that it remain fleet of foot. It has received unwanted approaches before - ICI bid for it in 1961. But much has changed since - for the worse. In the two decades following the 1970s, employment in the industry fell from nearly a million to 400,000. More recently, Courtaulds and others have seen values unpicked by ferocious international competition and exchange rate problems. Deutsche Bank textiles analyst Joan D'Olier says: 'After the demerger it did quite well. But recently it has been badly hit, like all textiles companies.' The big wobbles came in 1995-6.

D'Olier says: 'That coincided with a period when the dollar was particularly weak, which is when things became very uncomfortable, because a lot of Far Eastern currencies are linked to the dollar. It sucked a lot of cheap imports in here.' Profits slumped - 1994's \u00a347.3m dropped 14 per cent. A 1996 shake-up saw the arrival of current head Colin Dyer, who thinned out the business - ridding it of superfluous operations - attacked costs and began to shift production out of the UK. Last year, the company said it had reduced costs by \u00a340m - but when you consider that of \u00a3893m turnover, sales costs totalled \u00a3693m, and operating profits are still at 1995 levels of \u00a342.1m, it shows that there is much more to be done.

      "body": "<p>In Kurt Andersen's futuristic account of the culture of dot.com start-ups, Turn of the Century, one of his characters had lost her job in the great News Corp Internet meltdown. </p> <p>Rupert Murdoch will be hoping that life does not imitate art in this particular instance. But it is certainly true that the most keenly watched media strategist in the world is worried that the rampaging values of Internet-based companies pose a real threat to the global dominance of News Corporation. </p> <p>A week ago on his own Fox News Channel, Murdoch gave an interview suggesting that he did not want his company to become 'a snack' for Yahoo! or AOL. This was bound to alert interest. </p> <p>As one media analyst pointed out: 'The trouble with snacking on News Corp is that you end up swallowing one hell of a poison pill - Rupert!'. In addition to this there is the arcane holding structure of News Corp, with an off-puttingly high stake held by the Murdoch family trust, Cruden Investments - which holds around 35 per cent of the parent company. </p> <p>But while a velociraptor from a dotcom is not exactly poised to rip the guts out of News Corp, Murdoch is easily the most agitated of the 'old media' barons by the opportunities and threats of the Internet.

      "bodyText": "In Kurt Andersen's futuristic account of the culture of dot.com start-ups, Turn of the Century, one of his characters had lost her job in the great News Corp Internet meltdown. Rupert Murdoch will be hoping that life does not imitate art in this particular instance. But it is certainly true that the most keenly watched media strategist in the world is worried that the rampaging values of Internet-based companies pose a real threat to the global dominance of News Corporation. A week ago on his own Fox News Channel, Murdoch gave an interview suggesting that he did not want his company to become 'a snack' for Yahoo! or AOL. This was bound to alert interest. As one media analyst pointed out: 'The trouble with snacking on News Corp is that you end up swallowing one hell of a poison pill - Rupert!'. In addition to this there is the arcane holding structure of News Corp, with an off-puttingly high stake held by the Murdoch family trust, Cruden Investments - which holds around 35 per cent of the parent company. But while a velociraptor from a dotcom is not exactly poised to rip the guts out of News Corp, Murdoch is easily the most agitated of the 'old media' barons by the opportunities and threats of the Internet. In his interview with Fox he went on to say that his company would pursue a strategy of 'unlocking value' in its divisions, with particular attention paid to the assets residing in his many satellite TV interests. By far the largest and most potent of these is a 40 per cent stake in the UK satellite broadcaster BSkyB. By Monday morning sources 'close to News Corp' were suggesting that the fair interpretation of Murdoch's comments was that he would pursue a strategy of spinning off his satellite businesses into a separate company which would then seek a further flotation. 'The aim is very clear - to bolster the cashflow going through News Corp by another $10 billion or so,' said one analyst. While much of this sounds like the driest of City jargon, if the plan is followed through it would not only have a transforming effect on Murdoch's business but also mean a quantum shift in the UK media landscape. The 'source' speculated that in a new company which took in all of Murdoch's satellite TV businesses in an 'umbrella', he would float some 40 per cent of the stock.

This would certainly free Sky from the tag of being the company routinely referred to as '40 per cent controlled by Rupert Murdoch'. It would also make it more difficult for the UK authorities to adopt the 'block Murdoch' position on every purchase. To say that BSkyB has been regulatorily disadvantaged in the past two years would be an understatement - but how would this sit with the Government if Murdoch's holding were to be further diluted? Does this make BSkyB one of the UK's potential 'global champions' which the Government is very keen to encourage? There are still a large number of sceptics who think that the last strategic option Murdoch would take would be the reduction of his holding in Sky. But in fact, as the satellite broadcaster's share price raced to take the company's valuation from \u00a316bn before Christmas to \u00a330bn at its peak last week, it has meanwhile slipped into loss as it bolsters investment in both online and digital developments.

What lessons can we learn from the Stephen Lawrence incident? I don't think there's anything that can be done - the police won't change. Stuart Tayler, 27, actor, Richmond How would you describe yourself? English. Where were your parents born? England. What is the worst racial prejudice you have encountered? I haven't had any personal experiences. Do you think Britain has become more or less racist, and in what way? Less, because there is more of an ethnic mix. It's now normal to be multiracial, especially in London. What lessons can we learn from the Stephen Lawrence incident? I sympathise with the event, and the police did make some serious mistakes. But although whites can be racist, other races can be racist too. Sati Willang, 21, student , Edinburgh How would you describe yourself? Indian/British. British because of my nationality and Indian because of my roots. Where were your parents born?India. What is the worst racial prejudice you have encountered? I've never had any. Do you think Britain has become more or less racist, and in what way? Less, because Asian parents have accepted the British way of life and the British have accepted different cultures - a sort of compromise. What lessons can we learn from the Stephen Lawrence incident? The police need to be aware of what's going on, but blacks and Asians need to be aware that not everything is racist and they should not assume that if they are stopped it's because of racism. Henry Rogers, 64, retired, Twickenham How would you describe yourself? A Londoner because I was born here. Where were your parents born? England. What is the worst racial prejudice you have encountered? I've worked a lot overseas, but even in places that had difficult social or political situations I was never hassled.

But Kirker has advanced glaucoma and is partially sighted. He maintained that the real reason he was being made redundant was his disability. </p> <p>The Employment Appeal Tribunal agreed with him, particularly as on occasions before the introduction of the Act, Kirker, who lives in Newark, Nottinghamshire, had been refused promotion due to his condition. </p> <p>The Act took effect at the end of 1996. At the time it applied only to companies with 20 or more staff; this has since been reduced to 15. Essentially, it gives the UK's 2.2 million disabled people of working age the right not to be discriminated against 'unjustifiably', and gives employers a duty to make 'reasonable' adjustments to the workplace to accommodate them. </p> <p>In practice, a visually impaired job seeker can expect a company to supply either a Braille or an audio version of an application form, and a wheelchair-using applicant could expect a company to seriously consider ground floor offices or getting lift access. </p> <p>When the Act came into force, many charities and lobby groups representing disabled people were concerned about the lack of a commission to investigate complaints and push through the implementation of the legislation. The Government has responded by setting up the Disability Rights Commission, headed by Bert Massie, previously director of the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation. </p> <p>The commission will have the power to formally investigate cases, as well as providing a central source of information and advice to disabled people, business, employers and service providers. It will also carry out research and advise the Government on the operation of the Act. </p> <p>Jill Stewart of Scope, the charity for people with cerebral palsy, says: 'We campaigned for a proper commission, and the Government has delivered, although the level of funding is not as much as we would have liked. Our argument was that it would need more money than the other two commissions [race and equal opportunities] as there are more issues surrounding disability.' </p> <p>One issue being addressed by the Disability Rights Task Force, which recently delivered its final report, concerns the definition of 'disability'. For instance, someone diagnosed as HIV-positive is not covered by the Act until they develop symptoms; the same applies to cancer sufferers. The task force is recommending that sufferers should be covered from the time they are diagnosed. </p> <p>Stewart says the new law has proved its worth in terms of employment protection. 'It has definitely concentrated the mind of business: several major companies, such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury's and Barclays, are leading the way.' </p> <p>But the Act does not aim just to help disabled people into work; it also protects those who develop a wide range of illnesses while working. According to employment law specialist James Davies of solicitor Lewis Silkin, claims brought under the Act relate mainly to back pain, stress, depression and anxiety, and the onus is on the employer to make a reasonable adjustment to the environment or the job itself to accommodate the sufferer. </p> <p>A recent case involving a London borough illustrates the point. An employee suffering from ME, a condition which causes debilitating exhaustion, who had been off work for some time, wanted to ease back into the job gradually, returning initially on a part-time basis. </p> <p>The human resources department's response was to say, return full-time or not at all. An employment tribunal found in favour of the employee, saying that the borough had failed to make a 'reasonable adjustment'. </p> <p>Davies says: 'Before the Act an employer could dismiss someone with MS, for instance, once the condition had affected their ability to do their job; now it is more difficult to do so. An employer must first look at what adjustments can be made to accommodate the employee.' </p> <p>At present it is easier for an employee with a disability who is in work to fight their corner than for someone looking for a job. While Davies is quite bullish about the chances of success in taking a company to a tribunal if the applicant believes they did not get a job because of their disability - and he knows of cases where settlements have been made - Stewart takes the view that in practice it is usually very hard to prove. </p> <p>Now Scope, with other charities, is campaigning for the legislation to be strengthened by bringing employers of two or more people under the Act, as well as demanding that the Government make more efforts to support the disabled through its various schemes for the unemployed. </p> <p>'The Government's broad approach and measures to increase employment prospects for disabled people are welcome, but there are still many problems to be understood and overcome,' says a Scope official.</p>",

What's more, the trade unions are on the whole a positive force in favour. </p> <p>On the other hand, one of the reasons for the UK's piecemeal approach to the issue is the ineffectiveness of the HR profession.

One of the most important lessons of institutional change is that you can't start from where you haven't been. The good news for the UK is that it doesn't have a coherent national workplace relations system in place, so there is nothing for a high-commitment model to displace. What's more, the trade unions are on the whole a positive force in favour. On the other hand, one of the reasons for the UK's piecemeal approach to the issue is the ineffectiveness of the HR profession. Unless it can make itself more credible, it is an unlikely driver of dynamic new high-commitment partnerships. Bridging the gap between HR rhetoric and reality would be a good place to start. simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk",
