But in practice they could lead you to a more expensive loan. Treasury Minister Melanie Johnson said: 'Cat standards will be an important part of providing simple, clear, easily comparable information. All borrowers stand to benefit, be they first-time buyers or existing mortgage holders, and regardless of their property's value or location.' </p> <p>Only these loans - Cat stands for Charges, Access and Terms - comply with rules set by the Government: they must, for example, have a variable rate no higher than 2 per cent above the Bank of England base lending rate - currently 6 per cent. </p> <p>But loans qualify only if they offer the same terms to all borrowers - a big problem as lenders tend to give their keenest deals only to new customers. One of the best deals available now from the Halifax is a two-year discount of 1.95 per cent off the standard variable rate, with no early redemption penalties. </p> <p>But Halifax would 'struggle really hard to offer this deal to existing customers', says Patrick Bunton of London &amp; Country Mortgages. </p> <p>Borrowers taking the discount would pay 5.79 per cent; existing borrowers on the standard variable rate would pay 7.74 per cent. </p> <p>So the best deals will probably be outside the Cat system. Halifax hopes to launch Cat deals in June. But most of its 25 or so offers will remain non-CAT deals. A spokeswoman says: 'The pricing structure has yet to be worked out. If everybody decided that Cat was for them, we would have 2.5 million customers transferring their mortgages.' </p> <p>Yorkshire building society last week became one of the first lenders to meet the Cat terms. Its first such mortgage is a 6.74 per cent variable-rate loan. It is competitive compared with other variable rates, but does not match the best discount or fixed deals. </p> <p>Spokesman David Holmes says the society has a policy of offering the same deals to new and existing customers. But he thinks lenders who try to offer both sorts of loan could change their ways if Cat standards prove popular. </p> <p>'At the moment, existing borrowers are subsidising the acquisition of new business by most lenders,' says Holmes. 'But the Cat standard may have the effect of levelling the market out.' </p> <p>Another possible concern is that lenders can offer very uncompetitive terms and still qualify. A variable rate needs to be within 2 per cent of base rate to meet the CAT standard. But none of the leading lenders is near 8 per cent now. Nationwide is offering 7.29 per cent, many others are offering 7.4 per cent - and the vast majority are at 7.74 per cent or less. Similarly, an uncompetitive fixed-rate deal would qualify for a Cat. </p> <p>So, in short, a CAT sign is not an indication that you are getting value for money. </p> <p>Many of the deals which will meet the standard are 'flexible' arrangements, through which you can 'overpay', 'underpay' and take payment breaks. </p> <p>These mortgages are far more expensive than the discount offers. Virgin Direct, for example, charges a rate between 7.10 and 7.70 per cent, depending on the size of deposit that borrowers can put down. </p> <p>Virgin 'emphatically' welcomed the new system last week - although, ironically, it cannot qualify since it breaches one of the less important rules. A Catmarked loan must be offered on sums of \u00a310,000 or more; Virgin has set a \u00a325,000 minimum. </p> <p>But the Cat could still be useful - especially in help ing us all to think about the pros and cons of particular deals. To meet the standard, a mortgage must comply with these rules: </p> <p><strong> The charges</strong><br> </p> <p> \u0095 Interest must be calculated on a daily basis (not monthly or annually as many lenders do now). </p> <p>\u0095 There can be be no separate fee for mortgage indemnity (a charge levied by many firms to cover their own risk if a borrower has a deposit of less than 15 per cent. </p> <p>\u0095 Fees for arranging variable-rate deals are banned.

In Europe, the UK is the self-proclaimed inward investment champion, gobbling up half the available total, compared with a meagre 5 per cent for France and 3 per cent for Germany. </p> <p>The figures are huge. In 1998 foreign companies invested \u00a340 billion in the UK, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

Inward investment has gone unchallenged for so long as a plank of economic policy that people have forgotten to ask the more troubling questions.

In the first place, much FDI activity represents mergers and acquisitions, which have replaced greenfield investment - building new factories - as the largest component of inward investment in developed countries. </p> <p>As Bob Bischof, chairman of direct marketer McIntyre &amp; King, points out, that makes it 'instead-of' investment, not 'additional' investment. In effect it is 'outward divestment' by UK companies rather than extra inward investment, the total of which is quite small. </p> <p>Semantics? Not when you relate it to the way the economy is currently run. The implications of foreign ownership and an unsympathetic economic policy are horribly illustrated by the Rover debacle. Twenty-five per cent of UK manufacturing is in the same position as Rover.

'It's the \"furthest away from headquarters\" syndrome,' says Bischof. 'If you're in London, the Newcastle or Welsh plant goes first. Exactly the same applies internationally.' </p> <p>By the same token, the vaunted 'clusters' of foreign investment in the North East or 'Silicon Glen' are fragile things. 'They are not embedded in the local economy,' says David Johnson, director of Durham Business School's Barclays Centre for Entrepreneurship. Without the anchorage of special skills or particular know-how in the area - as at homegrown Cambridge, centred on the university - there is little to tie them in when the going gets rough. </p> <p>None of this is to deny the economic benefits that some inward investment provides. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) estimates that a third of UK industrial productivity growth since the mid-1980s can be attributed to the 'ripple-through' effect of better work practices imported by the incomers, principally the Japanese. Despite the strength of sterling, Japanese implants have also done much to sustain export figures in sectors such as cars and electronics. </p> <p>But there is no such thing as a free lunch. Why has Johnny Foreigner (with the exception of BMW) been able to make a go of industries which British companies are abandoning in droves - cars, electronics, televisions, utilities? Why has it taken foreign management to restore a measure of credibility to British quality and British labour? </p> <p>A large part of the answer lies in vastly better management at every level. For foreign firms, the opportunity to buy cheap assets and cheap labour with which to compete in a wildly overpriced UK market is a no-brainer, particularly since ease of entry and investment are matched by ease of exit. </p> <p>Meanwhile, spurning the opportunities on their doorstep, UK firms have become the world leaders in exporting capital. Last year they invested a towering $212bn overseas, more even than the US. Unlike the US, the UK is a huge net outward investor. </p> <p>Bischof believes that the steady evacuation by British firms of the most competitive commercial arenas is no accident. It is driven, he argues, by fierce short-term pressures from shareholder institutions which won't tolerate the high investments, patience and determination that long-term competition requires. </p> <p>Thus, in what is supposed to be the financial centre of the world, there is no British representation left in investment banking, the most globally strategic and competitive area. UK banks have retreated to the High Street - where their cartel is now under increasing pressure. </p> <p>Too often, the ownership transaction isn't just a swap of accents or assets.

      "body": "<p>The script for the horror story is easy to write. Here is a company, Arcadia, which has lost almost \u00a39 million in the first half of the year, having made a \u00a326m profit a year earlier. It has debts of more than \u00a3200m - some four times the company's stock market value. </p> <p>It is being forced to get rid of 400 shops. And that will involve shedding no fewer than 3,500 jobs. In other words, this is a company in deep, deep trouble. </p> <p>Now, bearing this in mind, consider something else: that in the nine weeks from mid-January to mid-March, Arcadia's shops - or at least those which have been under its control for more than a year - sold, on average, some 16 per cent more clothes than they did 12 months earlier. This, surely, is a picture of burgeoning retail success. </p> <p>So how to square these two, diametrically opposed versions of events? Easy: they are, in fact, entirely consistent. Arcadia's shops have, indeed, increased their sales enormously. The problem is this: they sold 15 per cent more clothes, but these clothes were sold at much lower prices. Arcadia was able to shift its merchandise only by cutting prices. Hence the amount of cash taken by its shops rose by a much more modest 4.3 per cent. And, as even a novice market trader will tell you, it is easy to increase sales by cutting prices; the big challenge is increasing sales while still making a profit. </p> <p>The clothing market has proved a vicious environment for mid-range retailers over the past 18 months. Estimates of the scale of price deflation vary hugely, but Arcadia's 10 per cent estimate is probably as good as any. And in the two years from 1997 to 1999, the amount of retail space devoted to clothing on British high streets is reckoned to have increased by around 5 per cent. The cost of rent and rates on each square foot of that space has risen by perhaps 5 per cent in the past year. That money has to come from somewhere. And in large part, it is coming from retailers' profits. </p> <p>Arcadia and its bigger brother Marks &amp; Spencer have been the most high-profile casualties of this squeeze. This is scarcely surprising. After all Arcadia, with a huge range of shops stretching from Evans, Top Shop, Wallis, Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Top Man to Miss Selfridge, Principles, Racing Green and Richards, has roughly 10 per cent of the national clothing market. </p> <p>But in Arcadia's case, there has been a particularly nasty twist of the screw. M&amp;S, remember, owns virtually all its own shops, so it doesn't have to pay much rent. Arcadia's rent bill, by contrast, is mammoth. That money has to be covered from the surplus on operating shops before the company even starts to make a profit. It is, in the jargon, highly operationally geared: a small change in the company's sales or margins has a big impact on its pre-tax profits. In the harsh world of retailing, it is a vulnerable beast. </p> <p>Last week, as Arcadia unveiled its half-year results, the company outlined its plans to close 400 shops. Of course, there is no reason to suppose that these stores will not go to other clothing retailers. In retailing, shrinking a business does not shrink the industry as a whole; it simply shuffles a given amount of sales space into new hands. </p> <p>So will Arcadia find itself facing new competition from the very shops it has shed? John Hoerner, the group's chief executive, isn't worried. In the current climate, opticians or coffee shops are more likely to pay up for extra space than a fashion retailer. </p> <p>But even if Hoerner is proved right - and one suspects that, on balance, he probably will be - an upheaval on this scale costs big money. As well as closing stores, scores of outlets under one Arcadia name will be moved to a different one: a Top Man may reopen as an Evans. In total, the group is having to swallow write-offs of \u00a360m plus further costs of \u00a330m. </p> <p>The company is still vulnerable. M&amp;S's problems over the past 18 months have made more headlines. But M&amp;S does still make profits of around \u00a310m a week. In part, that is because a fair chunk of the operation is devoted to selling food. But more important is M&amp;S's wonderful inheritance of freehold property. Arcadia doesn't have that luxury. To cover its rent bill and more, it has to run hard to stand still. </p> <p>The clothing market may be uncomfortable for retailers, but consumers have never had it so good. There is more space devoted to offering choice in clothing, and the price of that clothing has fallen. We, at least, can rejoice.</p>",

I got into a frightful mess. </p> <p>Learning from my own mistakes, I can offer the following advice: Start planning early by taking your most recent bank statements, and making a list of all your standing orders and direct debits. Arrange them in date order. If you have any which are paid quarterly or annually, add them to the list. Then find another bank. </p> <p>Easier said than done, it seems. One prospective suitor told me it wouldn't be possible to transfer my overdraft, 'as you have no credit history with us'. </p> <p>At another, I was told: 'You don't need to see anyone to transfer your account.' But this was followed up with: 'You can see one of the advisers on the front desk' - which I could see was empty.

But it may take up to a further two weeks before you receive your chequebook, PIN and debit/cheque guarantee card. </p> <p>Ask whether your present bank will transfer your direct debits and standing orders to your new account. This will save a lot of hassle, but not everyone will do it. HSBC and Smile, the Internet bank do. Lloyds used to, but now doesn't; while a number of others are doing so as part of a pilot project. </p> <p>Next, arrange to have your salary paid in to your new bank. Do this by writing to your payroll department immediately after the final date you wish your salary to go in to the old account. This gives everyone involved the maximum time to sort out the details before your next salary goes in. </p> <p>Assuming your new bank won't transfer the standing orders and direct debits for you, write to your old bank or building society asking them to cancel any standing orders. Then move on to your direct debits. Many organisations, such as Thames Water and British Gas, allow you to bypass paperwork completely, and do everything over the phone. </p> <p>But where this is not an option, contact those organisations you pay by direct debit for new forms, and obtain standing order forms from your new bank. Requests can be in writing, although picking them up in person can often be quicker. </p> <p>Once you have completed the forms, you must pick one of two ways to proceed. There is 'big bang' - choosing a date immediately after most of your payments have gone through, and firing off forms in all directions. Or there is the more detailed and cautious approach of waiting until immediately after each direct individual debit or standing order from your old account has been debited, before taking action. </p> <p>The advantage of the former approach is that you get the administration over and done with in one go. </p> <p>However, if your timing is unfortunate, you may find a payment is missed, is paid from the wrong account, or worse still, that both your accounts have been debited. In which case it may be hard to prove the error was someone else's, and not yours. </p> <p>The latter approach, though slower, minimises the chances of financial chaos. And should anything go awry, you are more likely to receive full and immediate refunds from your branch. </p> <p>No matter how careful you are, things can still go wrong. You are dependent on a long chain of individuals and organisations, some of whom, after all, may be the people responsible for causing you to switch your account in the first place. </p> <p>Once you have decided on your overall approach, don't delay. Return the completed direct debit mandate forms to the companies concerned, and the standing orders to your new bank. It can take up to two weeks for organisations to act on these instructions. </p> <p>Then write to your former bank or building society asking them to cancel the direct debits. This will usually be done within two or three days. You will normally receive a letter back confirming your instructions, and asking you to contact them if any of the details are incorrect. </p> <p>Transferring your current account will nearly always take longer than you expect, typically between one and two months, says the CA's Melanie Green. So try to leave enough money in your old account to allow for any payments still to be made.

      "body": "<p> <strong> Chief Rabbi Professor Jonathan Sacks:</strong> We met a long time ago when I was a student at Jews' College in London, and Rabbi Steinsaltz came to give a talk in the 70s. Everyone who begins studying the Talmud meets Rabbi Steinsaltz, because one of his great works has been to make the Talmud accessible to students. So I knew of him long before I met him because he was my gateway to the world of rabbinic learning. </p> <p> Rabbi Steinsaltz always stays with me when he's in London, which is two or three times a year, and he always says something that lifts my spirits. When we meet up, we tell each other stories - we learn to laugh at our problems. And so we live from encounter to encounter, as Adin is one of those people who perhaps despite, or perhaps because, he is part of another very complicated Jewish community in Israel. He sees very far and very deeply into the problems of this community, and so always manages to say something that I needed to hear in order to have the strength to write the next chapter or fight the next battle. </p> <p> The relationship is very simple. The story's told of a great Hasidic master, Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, who one year foresaw that the harvest would be infected and whoever would eat it would go mad, and Rabbi Nachman said to his disciple, 'What shall we do? If we eat it, we'll go mad, but if we don't eat it, we will fail to share in the suffering of our community.' So they decided they would eat of the grain but each one would put a mark on the forehead of the other so that while everyone else was mad, at least the two of them would know they were mad. And that is the relationship between Rabbi Steinsaltz and myself; knowing we're both mad keeps us sane. </p> <p> It was the encounter with another remarkable person, Rabbi Lubavitcher, who set me on this journey to becoming a rabbi. I met him when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge, and I travelled to New York, and immediately he started encouraging me to be a leader. I realised that here was someone who believed in me more than I believed in myself. And as the years went by, I sensed a challenge that I had to respond to. </p> <p> Sometimes you discover that religious leadership can be a very lonely job, and the knowledge that there is someone else somewhere else who understands, that in itself is a source of enormous strength. </p> <p> We are a people of very strong individuals, and therefore it is very difficult to be a leader because, quite rightly, every Jew sees himself or herself as a leader, and that means it can sometimes be a difficult and fraught life, but all you really need is a friend who understands and sympathises and lifts the burden, and that's what Rabbi Steinsaltz is for me. He's also a role model of how one can be very much in the heart of Jewish life and Jewish study, and yet preserve your integrity intellectually and ethically. </p> <p> The word adin is the nearest Hebrew gets to a particular kind of gentleness, which is Adin's very great characteristic. Adin is both a mystical and a poetical person, and poetic spirits are relatively rare in contemporary Judaism. And to hear Rabbi Steinsaltz speak is to hear a poetic stream of consciousness. It is always a wonderfully ethereal vision, which he always brings down to earth by analogies and stories which are so unexpected that one realises one is in the presence of a very vast intelligence indeed, and a very benign one. </p> <p> <strong> Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz:</strong> I met Jonathan about 30 years ago, which is a sizeable part of both of our lives. The age difference between us is only 10 years, he's 51, and as far as I remember he was a student at Jews' College when we met. I was a different, slightly older person trying to do the same thing Jonathan dreamt of doing. When I first saw him, I realised he was intellectually and otherwise, clearly above the others. </p> <p> We became very friendly. We have an affinity in so many ways. I have very few friends like this, where you can be friends without needing to send cards between visits. Rabbi Sacks visits Jerusalem three or four times a year, and he has such a busy timetable that it is easier for us to spend time together in London. </p> <p> The thing that was most important was that he cared. He cares about God and he cares about Jews and the religion. My real question at the time was will he have the stamina to go through with the job of being a rabbi. And it is an immense job being chief rabbi - the chief rabbi has lots of titles but very little clout. People have lots of expectations that he cannot fulfil and you just get tired of the whole thing. In one way, nobody is strong enough to ignore all the politics, whether it is government politics or internal Jewish politics. A position like this needs stamina. </p> <p> When people asked my opinion about him being chief rabbi, I said I saw him as the only likely candidate - from all over the world. It was obvious to me from the beginning that he would go far. He has an unusual capacity for understanding, not only the Jewish religious world, but also the outside world. </p> <p> Rabbi Sacks's role is like the role of the Queen, or of a flag on a military unit. When the flag falls, it is a great defeat, but the flag itself cannot do that much, it's just a symbol. Just as the flag is a symbol of a country, so is Rabbi Sacks. </p> <p> One of the things we have in common is that we are like amphibious vessels - moving from secular philosophy to religious ideas and back again. My book Simple Words [Simon &amp; Schuster, \u00a317.99] says, among other things, that human beings are always amphibian in a sense, moving between the material and spiritual. The book aims to put complex philosophical ideas into simple words. Just imagine I gave you a cookie loaded with LSD, you would swallow it and then you would jump up. The book, likewise, is deceptively simple, so you might read it and think, 'There's nothing new in it. I've always thought like this', but afterwards you find your perception has changed. </p> <p>Rabbi Sacks and I talk about philosophy, and we sometimes compare wounds and talk about what makes people like us tick. We have similar missions in many ways. *</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> The Naked Chef </strong>BBC2 </p> <p> <strong> Madame Bovary</strong> BBC2 </p> <p> <strong> Ray Mears' Extreme Survival</strong> BBC2 </p> <p> <strong> When Louis Met Jimmy</strong> BBC2 <br></p> <p> 'Cooking's gotta be a laugh!' says Jamie Oliver (Oli-vah! Oli-vah! Gotta prosciutto or two!) as he constructs a dreamy-looking mozzarella, peach and parma ham salad: 'Baby chard, little bitta rocket, scatter... really, really casually... yeah, dead tempting to buy those bags of salad... pukka peaches - I like the skin, personally... a ripped peach looks so much better than a cut one. Buffalo mozzarella, soft and milky, better than the cheap stuff, rip it into nice little mouf-sized pieces...' </p> <p> 'Is it called buffalo 'cos it's so big?' asks a female voice from behind the camera. And is she, like, having a laugh or seriously confusing an Italian cheese with a brand of ugly footwear - the ones with the fat platform soles that used to be worn by Spice Girls and are now mostly favoured by 18-year-old waiflets from Eastern Europe who aspire to look like the old charity collecting-box orphan on a plinth? Either way, I don't think Jamie has any idea what she's on about. </p> <p> 'Nah! Cos it's buffalo milk,' exclaims Jamie. 'You're so sweet, dahlin!' and he carries on ripping and tearing his pukka ingredients and pretty soon it all looks, well, good enough to eat. Preferably now, please, God. Anyway, by the time Jamie gets to the sea bream - 'Pinch it at the breast...' He pauses. ' Breast? It's not a chicken! Pinch it at the fillet! Pucker it up!' - I am really quite weak. Just as one should never shop when hungry, so one should never watch Jamie Oliver tearing fruit and pinching fish.</p> <p> There was, it seems, food everywhere, all week. In Monday's first episode of Madame Bovary , for example, while our heroine is still Mademoiselle Emma and flirting with that nice Dr Bovary and long before she becomes a small-town shopaholic adulteress addicted to the nineteenth-century equivalent of OK! and failing to make the monthly payments on her Franklin Mint L'Heritage Thimble Collection, Emma enjoyed her food. Had even joked that her invalid father favoured something 'light and digestible' for supper, such as 'roast goose with endive and a slice of strawberry tart'. God, but that sounded good! </p> <p> However by episode two, on Tuesday, Emma's appetite for anything other than sex with Greg Wise and shopping for gowns of mustard silk with 50-metre skirts appeared to have wilted. 'You look ever so pinched about the gills,' observed Mme Bovary's maid shortly after her mistress had given birth to a daughter. Like Jamie's bream, Emma might have looked pinched about the breast, too, but had sensibly farmed out the baby to a wet nurse so Hugh Dancy's Leon and Greg Wise's Rodolphe might carry on thinking her good enough to eat. Indeed, we saw quite a lot of Madame's breasts and they weren't remotely pinched. </p> <p> But despite the fact that, for Emma, shopping was no substitute for sex, by episode two her love life had gone as pear-shaped as the family finances. One night, seated at the dining table with her husband and her mother-in-law and wearing a face like le wet weekend, Frances O'Connor's Emma had just been been dumped by her lover, Rodolphe. Her mood was hardly surprising, all things considered, because by this time we had all seen Greg's naked bottom and it was an absolute peach. At the table then, Rodolphe-less but presumably Wiser, Emma did not rip open her apricot but nibbled at it squirrelishly, all passion apparently spent. </p> <p> On the subject of passion, I noticed that Jamie Oliver uses the very fine Green and Black's organic chocolate for his gorgeous torte, replete with liquid pools of cocoa bliss and it occurred to me that Madame Bovary had not got enough in the way of choco-bliss. </p> <p> Not much in the way of chocolate to be had in the Canadian Rockies, either, where Ray Mears was busy surviving last week, though it occurs to me that 'Rockies' would make an excellent name for a butch brand of confectionery in the Yorkie vein. Chunky and pointy like a Toblerone mountain, this would be a Man's chocolate - and the kind of thing even Ray might not be too embarrassed to have tucked away in his rucksack. I love Ray Mears who, though obviously very good at surviving, appears to have no sense of humour at all - but perhaps living by your wits in the wilderness with only a film crew and a comfortable layer of, frankly, puppyish-looking fat to rely on is no laughing matter. Rather unfairly, there is something about Ray that reminds me of the blokes in the 'Let's Offroad!' Fast Show sketch but, whether alive or dead, Ray would still be the ideal companion if one had survived a plane crash in the Andes. </p> <p> In the Rockies, Ray built a beautiful moss-thatched lean-to, lashed together with spruce roots - it looked like Swampy's dream home. Then he went fishing in a glacial lake using line baited with grasshoppers. 'One of my favourite ways of cooking fish is just to steam them in moss over the fire,' said Ray, whose fire had been lit with some lovely curly kindling that we must surely soon be able to purchase by the bunch in Habitat. Later he made a squirrel trap baited with mad-looking mushrooms ('Wild fungi can enhance flavours. And they can kill.') and, later still, he cooked a stew of brook trout with fungi, boiled root of cat's-tails and thickened by the pith of what sounded like 'rosebay willowherb'. </p> <p> 'That's pretty good actually!' said Ray, slurpily. Though 'lost' in the wilderness, Mears had still managed to eat like a Fulham foodie, so it is no wonder he is comfortably upholstered. But Ray told us that bears can smell a nice brook trout stew from 20 miles away, so it is usually best to cook downwind, eat fast and get an early night inside your Hansel and Gretel hideaway. </p> <p> Meanwhile, exotic fungi - though not quite so exotic that they might actually kill you - had also added texture and flavour to Jamie Oliver's luscious sea bream affair: 'Don't use button mush rooms,' he advised. 'Forget them forever.' Jamie made a magic, mushroomy carpet of chanterelles, porcini and more, with juice infusing the sleek slivers of potato, atop which sat the bream bits, gleaming oozily. It looked much better than good. </p> <p> Jimmy Savile and Jamie Oliver might nearly be anagrams of each other but that's all they have in common, as Louis Theroux revealed in When Louis Met Jimmy - an oddly troubling little film about the prickly, curmudgeonly, humourless ex-wrestler and DJ-turned-Sir. Savile doesn't even have a cooker in his Leeds penthouse: 'There's plenty of caffs. Cooker means people , means making food, means washing-up, means ladies clattering and banging. No cooker, babe - no brain damage!' </p> <p> Over an hour spent in Savile's company revealed a man with, apparently, few friends and not much in the way of an interior life. Despite having raised some \u00a340 million for charity ('To put this in perspective, it's \u00a340m more than I've raised,' admitted Theroux drily) one wondered if his primary motivation hadn't been a need to be liked, or to have people somehow in his debt? And while I wouldn't go quite as far as to say that a man with no cooker is a man with no soul, to me, this fact alone indicated there was something very avoidable about him. </p> <p> Eventually, having bankrupted her husband and made herself a laughing stock, Madame Bovary visited the local pharmacy and persuaded the besotted shop boy to hand over some arsenic, which she stuffed into her mouth, right there and then. The arsenic looked as if its body-double was a chocolate torte's-worth of icing sugar or (a long shot, this) the Al Pacino character's private cocaine stash in Scarface - but either way it amounted to a very sexy bit of footage. And while I think that publicly bingeing on poison rather than, say, resorting to a knife or some suitably sinister fungi, proved that Mme Bovary's simmering passions were not yet quite spent, Modern Mrs Bs might be forgiven for choosing to top themselves alone after a meal ripped and torn (and maybe even cooked) by Jamie Oliver. Or Ray Mears, at a pinch.</p>",

This week in Strasbourg lobbying European Union officials about the future governance of football, Sir Alex Ferguson, the man whom Campbell has so assiduously courted as a high-profile supporter of New Labour, revealed himself a master of the third way. </p> <p>Ferguson was in the home of European junketing for a two-day meeting between EU officials and senior football figures. Generally the Manchester United manager prefers his two-day meetings to involve horses not administrators. But, while his presence in the heart of European bureaucracy was unexpected, it offered an intriguing vision of the future. </p> <p>In one corner at the discussion was a delegation led by Michel Platini, representing Fifa, Lennart Johansson, speaking for Uefa, and Gordon Taylor of the Professional Footballers' Association. They all argued that the Bosman ruling of 1995 has done huge damage to football, as the free contractual passage of players has concentrated wealth and power in a handful of clubs, thus suppressing competition.

      "bodyText": "All those afternoons Alistair Campbell has spent in the directors' box at Old Trafford when he is keen to tell the world he would rather be 50 miles up the road at Turf Moor seem to have paid off. This week in Strasbourg lobbying European Union officials about the future governance of football, Sir Alex Ferguson, the man whom Campbell has so assiduously courted as a high-profile supporter of New Labour, revealed himself a master of the third way. Ferguson was in the home of European junketing for a two-day meeting between EU officials and senior football figures. Generally the Manchester United manager prefers his two-day meetings to involve horses not administrators. But, while his presence in the heart of European bureaucracy was unexpected, it offered an intriguing vision of the future. In one corner at the discussion was a delegation led by Michel Platini, representing Fifa, Lennart Johansson, speaking for Uefa, and Gordon Taylor of the Professional Footballers' Association. They all argued that the Bosman ruling of 1995 has done huge damage to football, as the free contractual passage of players has concentrated wealth and power in a handful of clubs, thus suppressing competition. In short, they want it scrapped. In the other corner were the denizens of EU headquarters who are anxious that employment laws remain homogenised throughout the community, without exceptions made for any profession, not even football. And hovering somewhere in between was Ferguson, proposing what, on the surface at least, appeared to be more common sense than anyone else there. Although ostensibly part of the Platini/Johansson delegation, Ferguson was keen to distance himself from some of its aims. He believes, for instance, that there is significantly more wrong with his sport than can simply be attributed to Bosman. \"The fundamentals of football are wrong to begin with,\" he said. Meanwhile Johansson, through gritted teeth, tried to smile up some sort of united front. \"I know Sir Alex disagrees with me,\" he said. \"And that is his right.\" \"I can see the problem and I can see it getting worse,\" Ferguson replied. \"I do not want to see a return to the pre-Bosman days but I do believe there are solutions to the problem which the president does not agree with.\" Many who remember the manager's early days in Europe with Manchester United, trying to juggle his resources to conform to Uefa-imposed restrictions on foreign players, will sniff self-interest in this statement. Yet Ferguson's third-way analysis has considerable merit. It runs like this: it is possible to live with Bosman, indeed to take advantage of it.

Charlton are a friendly club with amiable supporters and a healthy tradition of redeeming lost causes. </p> <p>Their fans not only stuck by them when, after a dispute with a former chairman, Michael Gliksten, the team left the Valley for seven years between 1985 and 1992, they also entered local politics to hasten the club's return as well as raising money to help refurbish the stadium. </p> <p>Thousands travelled to the Valley for last night's game against Huddersfield Town happy in the knowledge that, even if Charlton did not achieve the victory that would complete their return to the Premiership after only one season back in the First Division, promotion was only a matter of time. And among them were those for whom this fixture will always have special meaning. </p> <p>For any Charlton follower under the age of 45, say, the name of Johnny Summers has only a distant ring. Younger supporters will have difficulty recalling it at all unless their elders have first-hand recollections of a December day in 1957 when Charlton and Huddersfield met at the Valley in a routine Second Division fixture which made history. </p> <p>Christmas was four days away and the crowd was a modest 12,000. The Valley was still hung over after Charlton's relegation from the old First Division the previous season, ending a stay of 21 years during which they had won the FA Cup and played before crowds of more than 70,000. Charlton had come down with a bump, conceding 120 goals. Scoring, however, was not a problem and when Summers was signed from Millwall for \u00a33,300 halfway through the relegation season the power of his left foot was always going to bring them goals. </p> <p>Summers, like Bobby Charlton and Tom Finney, was a goalscoring winger who could be equally effective in central positions. In 171 league matches for Charlton he scored 100 goals, five of them against Huddersfield on that famous December afternoon. </p> <p>Even after 43 years the course of the match makes barely credible reading. After 15 minutes Derek Ufton, Charlton's centre-half and captain, was carried off with one of the 20 dislocated shoulders he suffered during his playing career. There were no substitutes then. Charlton were down to 10 men and by half-time Hud dersfield were leading 2-0. And with just under half an hour to go the contest had seemingly become a rout. Huddersfield were 5-1 up and for Charlton there was surely little left in the game but damage-limitation. </p> <p>The rest, however, belonged to Summers. He had already scored once. Now, in the space of a minute, he struck again and set up a goal for John Ryan. </p> <p>Summers was inspired. He scored three more times in a little over 10 minutes to put Charlton ahead at 6-5 and, even though Huddersfield drew level, he sent in Ryan for the winner as the referee was about to end the match. </p> <p>Never before had any team scored six times in a league game and lost. Summers, moreover, had scored all his five goals in his team's 7-6 win with his supposedly weaker right foot. He had also changed into a new pair of boots at half-time. As footballing stories go, this one had everything. </p> <p>But not a happy ending. Five years later Summers died of cancer. At the end of the 1957-58 season Charlton missed promotion by a point and they did not regain their place in the First Division until 1986. </p> <p>Nevertheless the spirit of that winter afternoon in the 50s clearly continues to sustain Charlton, who could have felt sorry for themselves after a season's stay in the Premiership when more than half of their defeats were by the odd goal, but instead have responded with attacking football in the Summers tradition. </p> <p>With the same manager, Alan Curbishley, and much the same team they have played with five men up both home and away, scoring 41 of their 76 goals on opponents' grounds. There is not a side in the First Division to touch them and rather fewer pundits will forecast their immediate demise next season. </p> <p> O r will they? Some will argue that Charlton's free-scoring push for promotion this season, such a contrast to the difficulty they had breaking down Premiership defences, simply proves that the gulf between the two divisions is growing ever wider. </p> <p>To a large extent this is right. Joe Royle has done a wonderful job bringing Manchester City from the Second Division to the threshold of the Premiership in successive seasons but if City do go up the team will have to be massively rebuilt if they are not to become just another Nationwide house of straw with ideas above their foundations. </p> <p>Charlton are entitled to be more optimistic. Their previous experience of the Premiership, though brief, should help them gain a firmer footing next season. They clearly have more wrinkles than Watford and a better prospectus for survival than Bradford City. </p> <p>Put another Kevin Phillips at the head of their attack and they might do as well as Sunderland. Or maybe Curbishley will spot a 6ft winger with a natural left foot and sign him for a Summers song.</p>",

And Coventry manager Gordon Strachan forked out \u00a3500,000 for a player who as he says \"doesn't understand a word I'm saying but then nor does anybody else, and he's working hard on his English.\" The striker's English, barely better than Strach's, suggest his translator does most of the talking here.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When Ysrael Zuniga decided to join Coventry City he turned to his good friend and fellow Peruvian Nol Solano for advice. The Newcastle midfielder happily obliged. \"The first thing he said,\" Zuniga recalls, \"was get a thick overcoat.\" </p> <p>Zuniga has stopped short of turning up for training like Paddington Bear, but only just. On a morning so bright one half expects to find Gordon Strachan directing operations in a bathing costume, the 23-year-old is the only player sporting tracksuit bottoms. \"In Peru we have air conditioning, here you have central heating,\" he says. Not for the first time he laughs. </p> <p>The holder of South Amer ica's golden boot is a cheery character. His English does not stretch much beyond shouts of \"Keano\" and \"Shawsie\" - his teacher translated for this interview - but, despite not knowing his handies from his Andes, he has settled unexpectedly fast. </p> <p>When he arrived from Melgar in February, Zuniga was told he was one for next season. Instead he has played and scored. The language, he admits, is \"a big problem\"; by nature he is a talker. But the Spanish-speaking Moroccans Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo have helped and he is becoming one of the lads. When he misses a sitter in training, he gets the usual treatment. Zuniga, naturally, smiles. </p> <p>\"His attitude's smashing,\" says Strachan, who signed the 5ft 8in striker on video evidence, deeming it a worthwhile gamble at around \u00a3500,000. \"Sometimes when I'm giving tactics talks you can see him just grinning away. He doesn't understand a word I'm saying but then nor does anybody else, and he's working hard on his English. </p> <p>\"If he stays between the width of the 18-yard box he's excellent. If he goes outside that he's very ordinary. He's got a good football brain, he's a brave wee fella and he can score when he gets a chance. He doesn't panic.\" </p> <p>Zuniga's rise has been rapid. Last season with Melgar was his first in Peru's top flight. An impressive 32 goals in 26 games catapulted him first into the national team and then into the Premiership - not bad for someone who stumbled into football with Sporting Cristal by accident. \"I was studying as a dental technician in Lima,\" he explains, \"and my older brother, Cristian, was on the books of Sporting Cristal. I was visiting him one day and the manager just invited me to join in a training session. I had to borrow some boots. It started from there. </p> <p>\"There was a question of whether I would continue my studies or commit myself totally to football but the manager convinced me it was worth a go. My mother nearly killed me for it. She still says I shouldn't have given up the studies completely. I was always interested in football. But it wasn't until I went to Sporting Cristal that I really had the ambition to make it as a professional.\" </p> <p>It was there that Zuniga met Solano. The pair speak every week and Solano has emphasised the importance of learning English. Presumably, \"do you stock thermal underwear?\" will be the sentence he advises Zuniga to learn first. </p> <p>Word in the Coventry canteen is that Zuniga has struggled with his driving as well as his speaking. The delivery of his new 4x4 prompts mental notes to avoid local roundabouts. But, when Europe called, Zuniga had no hesitation in choosing Coventry ahead of Hertha Berlin, also ignoring Porto's late overtures. </p> <p>\"It was a big influence that the Premiership is such a competitive league, with every team having national players like Kanu and Desailly and Deschamps,\" he says. \"I know Coventry are always fighting to get as high up the table as possible and that's what attracted me to them.\" </p> <p>The pace, quality and physical demands will require adjustment but Zuniga is no arrogant superstar. He appreciates how fortunate he is. After leaving Lima aged three, he grew up in the small town of Camana, close to the Pacific beaches of southern Peru. His parents lived off the land. </p> <p>\"It wasn't really hard,\" he says, \"but people in Lima generally have a higher standard of living than in the countryside in Peru. My family was working class and where we lived the main product was rice, so most people made a living from growing rice or processing it, although there were also beans.\" </p> <p>Zuniga, happily ensconced in Leamington with his wife and PlayStation, should be joined in the summer by his compatriot Walter Zevallos, though passport problems are threatening the wing-back's move. Strachan admits it will be \"nearly impossible\" for Zuniga to become a regular before November because Peru face 17 World Cup qualifiers. Chile await later this month. But do not bet against the odd suspension. </p> <p>In the Copa America last July Zuniga came on against Bolivia in the 85th minute, scored the winner in the 87th and was sent off in the 90th. To prove that was no fluke, he was dismissed in February against the United States 13 minutes after leaving the bench. </p> <p>Those, he stresses, are the only sendings-off of his career. \"They weren't bad fouls,\" he says. \"Against Bolivia it was an innocuous challenge by the halfway line but the player dived.\" He mimics the theatrical fall.

So he cannot understand why his dad cannot behave like normal dads by taking him and his 21-month-old sister off to a sunny beach this summer, instead of going off to play in some silly tournament in Belgium and Holland. </p> <p>Being a devoted family man, the Leeds goalkeeper Martyn admits it is difficult for him to justify spending his entire close season on England duty at Euro 2000 when he accepts that the only glimpse his family are like to get of him is when the television cameras zoom in for a close-up of the bench. </p> <p>Martyn, in his 34th year, is in the best form of his life. But he understands that, when it comes to the England goalkeeping jersey, possession is more than nine tenths of the law. Arsenal's David Seaman, who will be at the opposite end to Martyn at Elland Road tomorrow, has been confirmed as the No1 by the coach Kevin Keegan, so unless he is injured, makes a couple of dreadful rickets or takes a phone call from Hansie Cronje's bookmaker, he is certain to play throughout Euro 2000. </p> <p>Fortunately patience to rival that of Job is a prerequisite for goalkeepers, who often serve by merely standing and staring at the action. Martyn says: \"You just have to wait your turn, like a lot of other England keepers have had to do. Chris Woods had to wait behind Peter Shilton but eventually won 43 caps. </p> <p>\"Of course it is frustrating because, no matter how well I play for Leeds, David is the man in possession of the England jersey. And it's not as if I can say 'give me a run on the right wing' as an outfield player might.\" Out of the question as that might be, if the culling of English left-sided players continues, Martyn should not rule out a request to play on the left wing. </p> <p>It might ease his frustration if he could bring himself to stick pins in an effigy of Seaman, who might suspect his rival of having done so, given his dreadful bad luck with injuries this season. But there is such a freemasonry among goalkeepers that they are good mates, who will share a joke whatever the result of tomorrow's crucial game. </p> <p>The televised encounter will allow the nation to join what has become a lively debate as to which of the keepers should be No1 in the Low Countries in June, with many believing that Martyn has overtaken Seaman. The latter will be distraught at learning that Gordon Banks, England's 1966 World Cup winning goalkeeper, has joined the bandwagon of doubters about his form. </p> <p>Banks says: \"David has been a great goalkeeper but at 36 you begin to lose some flexibility. On experience you would probably play him in Euro 2000 but after that Keegan will probably think about bringing Martyn in.\" </p> <p>Bob Wilson, a former Scottish international and Arsenal's goalkeeping coach, has witnessed first hand the pain of Seaman as the whispering campaign against him has grown, in some quarters, to a full-throated roar. Wilson says: \"He would never admit it publicly but the press campaign has got to him and he has been deeply hurt by some of the criticism. I have been unable to do anything to reverse that, which is why it was brilliant of Kevin Keegan to pull him aside after the Argentina game and tell him that he is his man. That is the biggest boost David has had all season.\" </p> <p><strong> Spectacular saves</strong><br> </p> <p>Although Seaman is also Wilson's man, Wilson is objective enough to admit that international experience - Seaman has 56 caps to Martyn's 12 - is probably all that is tipping the scales at the moment. He says: \"Nigel has had an excellent season and he has cut out what I would call his Bruce Grobbelaar moments. He is a very mobile, gymnastic type of keeper, who makes the sort of spectacular saves that Peter Schmeichel used to make for Manchester United. </p> <p>\"David is less spectacular but he has a massive presence and is probably closest in style to Pat Jennings. I think his international experience just makes the difference and Nigel finds himself in the same position as Ted Ditchburn and Bert Williams when Frank Swift was England No 1. We always seem to be blessed with more than one top goalkeeper.\" </p> <p>Or cursed, as Martyn might see it. Both keepers, as one would expect, play for club sides renowned for their defensive organisation, which puts even more of a premium on concentration. Martyn says: \"As the Leeds team has got better and better, I have had less and less saves to make in a game. But as the number of saves goes down, the level of importance goes up. Sometimes I only have to make two big saves in a game. Yet, if I make them and keep a clean sheet, people will say how well I'm playing.\" </p> <p>Martyn could not be blamed for the two goals scored by Galatasaray in their Uefa Cup semi-final as his defence lacked their usual cohesion, doubtless affected by the death of two Leeds fans the night before the game. He says: \"It would be a massive understatement to say that it was not the right preparation for the match. </p> <p>\"It was all we talked about beforehand. Someone saw the incident on the news and we were all going round knocking on each other's doors. It's terrible to think that two fans went out to support us and didn't come home.\" </p> <p>Martyn is confident that Leeds can overturn the deficit on Thursday. But the players, he says, must not allow what is sure to be an emotionally charged night to suck them into an unnaturally high tempo. They will need to show patience, which is something he already knows plenty about and which young Thomas Martyn is just beginning to learn.</p>",

The prospect of Hiddink going head to head with his fellow Dutchman Dick Advocaat barely brought a response from the Ibrox manager. \"There has been no contact between us,\" Advocaat said, pondering whether the Scottish weather would be a factor in Hiddink's decision. Advocaat's side are 16 points ahead and he was able to announce the same squad as that which took part in the midweek win over Hearts. \"We do what we have to, we don't concern ourselves with others,\" he declared. Aberdeen, who are bottom, play Hearts in the odd situation of knowing they are virtually certain of a European place - by virtue of reaching the Scottish Cup final where Rangers will be their opponents - but could still finish by being relegated to the First Division. Henrik Larsson has given up any hope of representing Sweden in this summer's European Championship finals in the Netherlands and Belgium. The Celtic striker has made a remarkable recovery from the broken leg that he sustained against Lyon during a Uefa Cup tie last October and at one stage looked ready to make a dramatic return to league action this season. However Larsson, 28, who picked up a fresh injury during a reserve match last month, said: \"I'll not play in the European Championship and although I'm disappointed at missing the tournament, I was always prepared for this.\" It is a bitter blow for the Swedish FA, which had asked Celtic to allow Larsson to return home so that his progress could be monitored prior to the tournament. But the Parkhead side are keen that Scotland's player of the year in 1999 continues his rehabilitation in Glasgow and denied the Swedish FA's request last week - a decision which was backed by Larsson. He said: \"Celtic didn't want me to go over there and I understand that because I'm under contract to them and they pay my wages.

      "body": "<p>In my mind's eye there is a scene: campfire crackling in the gloaming, tents set in the glade of trees, children playing by the stream and nobody for miles around, just bears, which we sense but never see. For two weeks, we drove hundreds of miles across Quebec in search of this scene, setting camp then striking it when the illusion broke. </p> <p>Quebec is boom time for British tourists: the Canadian dollar is weak against the pound, and it is clean and civilised, an enchanting mixture of France and North America. But what attracted me was the best outdoors in the world - thousands of miles of it. </p> <p>As a challenge to Canada's ability to absorb people, we flew into Montreal at the start of the busiest fortnight of the year - the mid-July construction workers' holiday. Motor homes need booking months in advance, but a chance cancellation delivered us a gleaming-white van. </p> <p>Motor homes blow a huge hole in your credit card: C$550 basic for the week, plus road tax, duty, gasoline, insurance, collision-damage waiver, extra mileage, plus state tax - that'll be a total of C$1,400, please. And the driving experience is like Saturday night in a Greek restaurant: cupboards rattle, crockery smashes, curtains swish backwards and forwards around every corner. </p> <p>Shouting above the clam our of the invisible poltergeist that was ripping our mobile home to pieces behind us, we headed down the 253km of motorway between Montreal and Quebec City. It was a relief to reach Quebec City and attempt to park at the Chateau Frontenac, the smartest hotel in the city, only to discover the van would not fit in its underground car park. The doorman made a superb job of hiding his utter disgust at having a camper van parked alongside the limousines outside. </p> <p>Before heading into the wild, we visited an Indian settlement to brush up on hunting and survival techniques. The once-mighty Huron warriors now number only 300 and their reservation is a 2km-square plot in a Quebec suburb. </p> <p>After learning how to make a sauna in a tent with hot rocks, we went hunting in the local Huron supermarket armed with credit cards and struck north, the van rattling much better after loading the fridge with bottles of beer. </p> <p>We shook and bumped up Highway 175 in our first foray into wild Canadian forest, a few hundred square miles of the Reserve Faunique des Laurentides, which is wild, apart from the huge highway running through it. </p> <p>After an hour and a half, we emerged on to the flat farming land surrounding Lac St Jean. Holland came to mind, or small-town Amer ica: straight roads, farm houses and fields as far as the eye could see. </p> <p>We camped by an abandoned mining town, Val Jalbert, on a camp site that was far from abandoned. Although I never heard my neighbours, I did not fly 3,000 miles to sit in bay 26. </p> <p>Val Jalbert is a monument to the power of the great companies that built Canada. A paper pulping company put a factory at the foot of a waterfall higher than Niagara, and for a time it was the most modern settlement in North America. Then a cheaper way to pulp logs was found and Val Jalbert closed down, its houses left to collapse. Today, Alcan controls Lac St Jean, owns the dams that power the production of aluminium, and it decides how high the level of the lake will be. </p> <p>Industry, I began to realise, had a serious impact on my dream. To a Canadian lumber company, the beautiful green forests are just a factory. And you don't want tourists crawling around in your factory, especially when you have 50-ton logging trucks roaring down single-track mud tracks. </p> <p>We journeyed down the River Saguenay, which sinks into a deep fjord before emptying into the St Lawrence. The campsites in the Saguenay National Park were full, so we settled for a site nearby, where many of the residents were clearly permanent, their camper vans mounted on bricks, with little fences and touches of domesticity. It reminded me of weekends at Withernsee, Hull's equivalent of the Riviera. </p> <p>Frustrated by the difficulties of accessing the forest, we set off across the wind-chopped surface of the Saguenay in sea kayaks and sat like insects lost in its enormity, staring up at cliffs plunging straight down from hundreds of feet. The tanker bearing down on us coincided with a storm appearing from nowhere splashing waves over the bow. As the children shivered in the prow, we paddled with weakening arms through the 3ft waves until the tanker glided by like a runaway skyscraper and we were pushed aside by its wash. </p> <p>Next day, after our clanking gypsy van surpassed itself with a 70mph race to La Baie Ste Catherine, we were lucky to get the last few places on a whale-watching boat. Between July and November, whales come to feed in the St Lawrence, where the saltwater of the sea meets the freshwater river. A deep underwater shelf forces the plankton to the surface and minke, finback and blue whales gather for a feast. </p> <p>For 45 minutes, we chugged out like day-trippers to Calais on a small cross-channel ferry until the cries of the oceanographer went up over the PA system announcing the first harbour porpoises of the season. A surreal scene met us through the mist as some 20 boats lined up in a silent semi-circle. Somewhere out there were whales. Then, suddenly, the water broke, plumes of water shot up and huge sleeked backs arced out of the sea. </p> <p> What followed was like Christmas sales fever at sea. As the oceanographer shouted, \"Minke at 1 o'clock\", 1,400 people ran to the front of the right side of the boat. \"Finbacks at 9 o'clock\", and they ran to the left, elbowing each other feverishly out of the way. </p> <p>Whale-watching boats are not allowed to chase after whales - and it is a question for how much longer these beasts will put up with this public feeding frenzy - but a smart captain can always guess roughly where they will surface. </p> <p>The most scenic part of our journey followed as we drove down from Baie St Catherine to Baie St Paul. Scots settlers built country homes and golf courses along the river. Whether it was the familiarity of the architecture or just the beauty of the scenery, we all decided that this little corner of Quebec, Charlevoix, is the area to which we would most like to return. Just south of Pointe au Pic is also where we found the best camp ground at Domaine du Gros Ruisseau. </p> <p>But camp grounds are not nature, and for that we had to re-trace our steps, east of Montreal, to the Laurentides. Here the parks are smaller but better prepared for tourism. Mont Tremblant, a ski resort in winter, has biking, roller-blading, swimming and two fabulous golf courses. </p> <p>We finally stumbled upon what we had been searching for in the unlikely setting of a hotel between Montreal and Hull. Chateau Montebello is a former private hunting lodge and comes with 200 sq km of land dotted with lakes stocked with pike, bass and trout. The hotel has 13 lodges for hire in this wilderness, called Kenauk, each on their own private lake. </p> <p>With our fishing permits, battery for outboard motor, rods, bait and picnic, we set out with a map of a large expanse of wilderness down sparsely signposted dirt roads in search of Moose Lake. We found it at the end of a little track half an hour later: a picnic table in the shade of the trees, a pontoon with a 12ft boat on each side and a half-mile-long lake just for us. We swam, fished, sunbathed and walked until dusk enjoying the total silence. As the sun set, I realised I had come as close to my goal as I was going to get on this trip. </p> <p>Out there, in the hundreds of square kilometres of land that surrounds the tiny bit of Quebec upon which roads have been built, there are tens of thousands of Moose Lakes. Until now, they have been the preserve of the out-rigger, the professional hunters who lease hundreds of kilometres for the shooting rights for moose and caribou. They are accessed only by light aircraft, or several days' drive in 4x4 vehicles with chainsaws to cut a path through trees that have fallen across the dirt tracks. </p> <p>I have no interest in hunting, but next time I will eschew the rattling motor home for plane and canoe and set off there to find my dream. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>A 24-25ft motor home, which takes six and sleeps a family of four comfortably, costs \u00a3798 a week in July/August, \u00a31335 for 14 days, through Canadian specialists Frontier Travel (020 8776 8709, <a href=\"http://www.frontier-travel.co.uk\">http://www.frontier-travel.co.uk</a>).

Counting the coast Students from 500 schools and colleges are keeping an eye on how environmental pressures are affecting the coastline of England and Wales. Between June and October, students will survey land-use along the entire coastline, evaluate accessibility and build up a photographic record for Coastline 2000, organised by the Geographical Association, the National Trust and Ordnance Survey. Interim results will be available in October. Further information on www.coastline2000.org",

      "body": "<p>I heard them before I saw them - an incessant hum, loud enough to make it seem as if our tiny aluminium boat was vibrating. But within a second, they were on us. And not just on us - but in us. In our hair, up our nostrils, trying to crawl inside my ear. We were being attacked by a swarm of killer bees. </p> <p>Only moments before, we had been peacefully gliding up a tributary of the Rio Nosara in Costa Rica, the near-silent throb of the battery-powered boat drowned out by the calls of birds rising from the mangrove swamp. Eckhard, our guide, had been pointing out a crab-eating buzzard resting on a branch only feet above us. We felt like real explorers - my boyfriend, my six-year-old daughter, and I - yet utterly safe. Only the spot where the alligators sunned, leaving long outlines of their bodies like giants' footprints on the sand, suggested a pleasant soup\u00e7on of danger. </p> <p>We were quite close to the shore, and hardly moving, looking for toads at the water's edge, when I heard the hum. Then the bees descended on us, hundreds of them, smothering our skin until it was all bumpy and black. My boyfriend was the first to be stung. He lashed out instinctively, brushing the bees from his forearm. It was a mistake. \"Don't move! Don't move!\" screamed Eckhard. A killer bee regards any movement as an act of aggression. The bees retaliated, and my boyfriend was stung again. </p> <p>Eckhard attempted to steer us away from the swarm. This was truly heroic; he knew that even the gentle sway of his hand on the tiller meant he would be stung. The killers went for his uncovered face as he steered a path through the twisted roots of the mangrove trees. Their stings first broke like little splinters, quickly becoming craters of red. We watched. We were not heroes. If we tried to help him, we would be stung again, too. </p> <p>Eckhard's hand began to wobble on the tiller. He could barely steer. The stings were beginning to make him feel woozy. We couldn't shake off our attackers; killer bees can pursue intruders up to half a mile. Eckhard's panama hat was a black furry umbrella of bees. </p> <p>\"They're still on me, aren't they,\" he groaned. \"Yes,\" was all I said, my mouth as tight as a ventriloquist. </p> <p>Eventually, our feeble boat began to outrun the bees. A few stragglers hung on, determined to punish us for invading their territory. As soon as we were free from the swarm, my boyfriend, bitten but less so than Eckhard, tried to remove the stings around Eckhard's face and neck. My daughter, who had been totally silent even when she was stung, suddenly cried. Her wail echoed along the creek, as animal as any sound from the wild beasts. </p> <p>Despite their ferocious reputation, killer bees do not often attack. In eight years as a guide in Costa Rica, Eckhard had been attacked only once before. Most victims survive. Estimates of the number of fatalities in South and Central America vary from 20 to more than 1,000. But when the swarms started migrating northwards, they began to make headlines in the world's press. </p> <p>The bees claimed their first Californian victim on May 20, 1998, a pit bull terrier called Killer. The news led to near panic across the country. Last month a 77-year-old woman in Las Vegas suffered a massive attack. </p> <p>These bees are monsters of our own making. In 1956, African honeybees - Apis mellifera scutellata - were imported from Tanzania to Brazil, in an attempt to improve the honey production of the imported European bees. African bees were used to hot weather, and produced five times as much honey as the Europeans. A year later, 26 colonies of African bees escaped from a research apiary in Brazil and mated with the Europeans to produce Apis mellifera adansonii. Their progeny began to spread throughout South and Central America. </p> <p> This new strain was different from its parentage, but not as hoped. The hybrid, soon known as the killer bee, is smaller, more vigorous, swarms more often, and is up to 10 times more likely to sting than the European bee. In technical language, killer bees have an \"excessive level of colony defence\". It was probably the vibration of our tiny engine that attracted them; they are often provoked by power equipment. In California, there have been two attacks on tree trimmers. </p> <p>Back on the balcony at Nosara Lodge, my stoic daughter scribbled a sign and stuck it to our bedroom door - \"Be Ware of Bees\". My boyfriend's arms had ballooned up. Eckhard's eyes were so swollen they were nearly shut, and his ears twice their normal size. He was muttering to himself as if on a powerful drug. I strained to make out he was saying. \"It's always the small animals, not the big ones, that get you,\" he burbled. \"Better five sharks than 20 killer bees.\"</p>",

He made his league debut with Middlesbrough in the first division in 1937, before his 18th birthday. </p> <p>The following season saw him make 22 appearances, scoring four times, but in the seasons immediately before the second world war, he had already become a major force. In the 1938-39 season, he made 38 appearances, scoring 14 goals. Into the army he then went, the Green Howards, and participated in the retreat from Dunkirk, but before he was posted to the Middle East he would make four wartime appearances for England, at inside-right. He also played games for Tottenham and Bournemouth. </p> <p>As a schoolboy, I was lucky enough to see one of Mannion's England appearances at Wembley - against Scotland, in January 1942 - and I still retain the image of him scampering over the snow, while a man behind me shouted, \"Come on, Mannion, boy!\" England won that game 3-0. Mannion's partner on the right flank was Stanley Matthews, and the centre-forward was the prolific Tommy Lawton, who scored twice. Both of them stayed in England throughout the war, years in which Mannion would certainly have consolidated his fame and played much more for his country. </p> <p>In fairness, it took no time at all to regain his place in England's team once he was demobilised. Indeed, he played in their first dozen full, postwar internationals. One of his finest displays was in Glasgow, in May 1947, when he scored twice in Great Britain's 6-1 win against the Rest of Europe. </p> <p>When Mannion had left England, the inside-right position had gone to Raich Carter, who proved an ideal partner for Matthews. When Carter eventually lost his place, it was to Matthews's partner at Blackpool, Stanley Mortensen. So Mannion settled into a powerful England attack at inside-left, where he duly became an ideal partner for another famous England winger, Tom Finney. </p> <p>The first time Matthews was picked for England on the right, with Finney on the left, was in May 1947, in Lisbon, against Portugal. Mannion was Finney's elegant partner. England won 10-0. A year later, in Turin, the same forward line routed Italy 4-0, with Finney, well abetted by Mannion, scoring the last two goals. </p> <p>Mannion's first wartime game for England had been played not far from home, on the ground of Newcastle United, when England beat Scotland, 2-1. Scotland, indeed, would figure largely in Mannion's international career. Playing against them, at Wembley once more, in April 1951, he fractured a cheekbone and had to leave the field. There were no substitutes then. Finney moved into Mannion's position, and had a fine game, but England's 10 men lost 3-2. </p> <p>Mannion played in only one World Cup; England's ill-fated 1950 excursion to Brazil, where, in the immense, newly-built Maracana stadium, he scored one of England's goals in their 2-0 win over Chile. Alas, neither he nor any other English player, could score in the next game, when they were sensationally beaten 1-0 by the scratch United States team in Belo Horizonte, still one of the strangest international results of all time. </p> <p>Of Mannion, occasionally his partner, so often his England team mate, Stanley Matthews once said: \"Wilf could turn on a sixpence and liked to play the short game. He had an instinctive football intellect. He was a beautiful player and a delight to the eye. On his day, there were few to touch him. So nice and modest.\" </p> <p>But Mannion was a player in an era of pitifully low maximum wages for footballers - \u00a310 a week in his case. It was a situation against which he rebelled, and at the end of the 1947-48 season he demanded a move to Oldham, taking a job selling chicken coops in the town while awaiting a concession from Middlesbrough. None came and, in the 1948-49 season, he was out of football for several months, in bitter conflict with his club. He was fined by the Football League, into the bargain, when he refused to give them details of illegal payments of which he had spoken. </p> <p>Curiously enough, he got a mere one goal in 35 games the following season, and wouldn't reach double figures again till 1950-51. His most prolific league season came in 1952-53, with 19 goals in 41 games. But the following year saw Boro relegated, Mannion getting just nine goals in 37 games. </p> <p>They promptly let him go to Hull City, where in his only season he scored just once in 16 games. Between 1954 and 1962, he played non-league football for Poole Town, King's Lynn, Havershill Rovers and Earlstown. There was also an unhappy, unsuccessful spell as manager of the then non-league Cambridge United - but then Mannion was never cut out for management. His last appearance for England was against France in 1951; a 2-2 draw. </p> <p>Paid as the Ravanellis and Juninhos would eventually be by Middlesbrough, Mannion would not, after his retirement, have been forced to work on a building site, and afterwards slide into penury.

      "body": "<p>Four miles per hour can seem like an awful hurry. It's barely the speed of an unfit jogger, and even London or Birmingham traffic usually manages to move faster. But if you take a canal break, your narrowboat sets the pace. By the second day, you find yourself wondering what the rush is. </p> <p>For busy people with stressful lives, short breaks are great in principle, but in the rush to enjoy them it's easy to lose sight of the point. Sometimes, they can leave you more depleted than when you left, but it's not a risk you run on a canal-boat weekend. It's a complete break with the pace of modern life. You leave your car at the boatyard and forget about it. It's impossible to hurry, the work is co-operative rather than competitive and the destination is almost incidental to the pleasures of the journey - there's no such thing as canal rage. </p> <p>There's work to be done, of course, but it's gentle, mindless and fun. It's a little like a school trip for grown ups. Opening and closing locks, getting the hang of steering and learning to cook a full fry-up in less space than you'd shower in at home are all a bit of a lark. </p> <p>This is a wonderful way for groups of friends to spend time together. Between locks, there isn't much work to do other than hand round the sandwiches and coffee or mix a jug of Pimms. If you don't talk to your friends properly all year, the few days on a canal boat can be precious. </p> <p>Some people are put off by what they think is a slightly naff image. The brochures have a strong emphasis on family holidays, and the boats themselves have a whiff of the caravan about them, all tie backs and bumping about in confined spaces. But the canals have a subculture of their own. Yes, there are plenty of families on holidays, but there are many permanent inhabitants, some of whom still think they are living in the 1960s - time obviously moves slower on the waterways. </p> <p>It's no surprise that canal breaks have become popular with stag parties: a decent pint and a passable curry are seldom more that a short walk from your moorings. But beered-up groups of single men are fairly low on many boatyard owners' list of desirable customers, and hen parties aren't particularly welcome, either.

      "bodyText": "Four miles per hour can seem like an awful hurry. It's barely the speed of an unfit jogger, and even London or Birmingham traffic usually manages to move faster. But if you take a canal break, your narrowboat sets the pace. By the second day, you find yourself wondering what the rush is. For busy people with stressful lives, short breaks are great in principle, but in the rush to enjoy them it's easy to lose sight of the point. Sometimes, they can leave you more depleted than when you left, but it's not a risk you run on a canal-boat weekend. It's a complete break with the pace of modern life. You leave your car at the boatyard and forget about it. It's impossible to hurry, the work is co-operative rather than competitive and the destination is almost incidental to the pleasures of the journey - there's no such thing as canal rage. There's work to be done, of course, but it's gentle, mindless and fun. It's a little like a school trip for grown ups. Opening and closing locks, getting the hang of steering and learning to cook a full fry-up in less space than you'd shower in at home are all a bit of a lark. This is a wonderful way for groups of friends to spend time together. Between locks, there isn't much work to do other than hand round the sandwiches and coffee or mix a jug of Pimms. If you don't talk to your friends properly all year, the few days on a canal boat can be precious. Some people are put off by what they think is a slightly naff image. The brochures have a strong emphasis on family holidays, and the boats themselves have a whiff of the caravan about them, all tie backs and bumping about in confined spaces. But the canals have a subculture of their own. Yes, there are plenty of families on holidays, but there are many permanent inhabitants, some of whom still think they are living in the 1960s - time obviously moves slower on the waterways. It's no surprise that canal breaks have become popular with stag parties: a decent pint and a passable curry are seldom more that a short walk from your moorings. But beered-up groups of single men are fairly low on many boatyard owners' list of desirable customers, and hen parties aren't particularly welcome, either. Some yards maintain an outright ban on single-sex groups, while others insist they can only be accepted by prior arrangement. Often it's no more than a question of talking to the boatyard and letting them get the measure of you. You need to be able to convince them that you're not about to sink their boat or otherwise terrorise the waterways. A plausible manner, patience and persistence should pay dividends. Even a short break of two or three days is enough to sample some of the best of the inland waterways. Top of many lists would be the Llangollen Canal, with the crossing of the spectacular Pontcysyllte aqueduct as its highpoint. Llangollen itself is surprisingly lively for such a small town. Less well known, but equally beautiful, the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal offers a manageable weekend heading up to Brecon from Abergavenny, skirting the edge of the Brecon Beacons. Lovely though these rural Welsh canals are, one of the joys of canal boating is that you can enjoy peace and relaxation even in supposedly busy parts of the country and you don't necessarily have to travel miles to get to them. Canals in the Midlands and North offer enjoyable short breaks. Stretches of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal are charming - right on the outskirts of Wolverhampton. The Rochdale Canal from Sowerby Bridge up to Todmorden is as scenic and tranquil as any, yet it's only a short distance from Manchester or Leeds.

      "body": "<p>S pring afternoons pass slowly in Argamasilla de Alba. Lying on a bench in the public gardens next to the river, I stare up through the branches of the limes at the warm sky. Is this where it all began, some time between 1601 and 1603? Or is it another place where the Spanish have felt free to indulge their fantasies? </p> <p>Recent experience says that though these towns and villages dotted across the Manchego plain are perfectly real, quiet and slumberous places - some described in detail by the writer who gave them a world significance - the stories told in them are fundamentally unreliable. </p> <p>A few minutes after 5pm, I'm standing in a cool underground room down a flight of steps from the courtyard of the 15th-century casa Medrano. Ten metres long and no more than three wide, it has a barrel-vaulted ceiling and a tiny barred window at pavement level for light. At one end, there is a straw couch and an old wooden table and chair. Miguel de Cervantes is said to have been imprisoned here. My guide explains that the house was Medrano's, mayor of Argamasilla at the time of Cervantes' detention, who would have been responsible for arresting him. </p> <p>There are two versions of the episode: that he was gaoled because he made a pass at the sister/niece/mistress of the marquis Don Rodrigo de Pacheco, who lived in the town, or that he was collecting taxes for the military Order of St John without authority. Either way, he was held for several months, and it's believed that he began writing Don Quixote while imprisoned - that here, in this room, he began to tell the story that is to the modern novel what Freud is to psychology. (Freud, incidentally, was one of Don Quixote's greatest admirers, valuing its permanent lesson for the reader of always needing to work out whether what we are seeing and imagining is true or false.) </p> <p>It feels right that Cervantes, banged up by a tax-evading landowner on the pretext of immoral behaviour, would have wanted to get his own back by satirising Don Rodrigo (who had a reputation for eccentricity) as the mad knight. To support the theory, there's a painting of the marquis in the parish church with an inscription that contains, in analogy, the words Cervantes wrote to explain the illness that caused Quixote's madness: \"He slept so little and read so much that his brain dried up and he lost his reason.\" </p> <p>I decide that I believe the Argamasilla story. Stories are a matter of confidence: the guide tells this one carefully and well. I trust her. </p> <p>I'm not sure I can say the same about the official responsible for tourism in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, 100 miles to the north, where I'd visited a few days before. Alcal\u00e1 lays claim to being the starting point of any Cervantes quest. The writer was born here, they say, in 1547, and they have a baptismal font, a reconstructed house in the Jewish barrio and a birth certificate to prove it. Now a world heritage site, Alcal\u00e1 is a finely-restored medieval town of towers and tame storks, with an awareness of the revenue to be had from tourism. It has an important place in Castilian culture. Its greatest glory is its university, established in 1499 by Cisneros, Archbishop of Toledo. </p> <p>After a tour of the Cervantine sites - including an impressive collection of first editions in the new museum to be opened later this year - I was invited to meet the councillor for tourism. I asked to see Cervantes' birth certificate. It was in a safe, I was told. There was a copy in a deep, unlit display case on the wall. But it was impossible to see precisely what was written on the paper. </p> <p>It would be right for Cervantes to have been born and educated here: Quevedo, Lope de Vega and Ignatius Loyola all passed through the university's doors. It wasn't until later, in another town, that I happened to hear another story that awakened doubts about Alcal\u00e1's Cervantes industry. </p> <p>Alc\u00e1zar de San Juan, small and opiate, lies east of the Toledan hills in the middle of the Mancha plain. There is a plaque in a sunny square: \"In a house on this site Miguel de Cervantes was born.\" I had seen other Cervantes-related plaques; this wasn't the first to claim kinship with the king. But when we reached the Romanesque church of Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor, things took an interesting turn. There was an entry in the baptismal records: \"On the 9th day of November 1558 baptised, a son of Blas de Cervantes Saavedra and Catalina Lopez, who is named Miguel.\" </p> <p>The date would have made Cervantes 11 when he was baptised (if in fact he was born in 1547), but late baptisms weren't uncommon at the time. Annotated in the margin were the words of a secretary of Philip III who had visited Alc\u00e1zar - \"the author of Don Quixote\". What did Father Vicente think of the document in Alcal\u00e1? \"It's a forgery,\" he replied decisively. </p> <p>For the pilgrim, you pursue what you hope will be the truth, and then, at a certain point, you realise that the quest is Don Quixote all over again, the modern version of knight errantry, a wild windmill chase. </p> <p>The windmills. Look at them in the distance at Campo de Criptana as you approach across the haze of the plain, 16 of them, and you just have to admit the truth of Quixote's vision. From several miles away these are giants, with their gleaming white bodies, their sails outstretched offensively, ranged in battle formation - and there were even more, 40 or so, in Cervantes' time. </p> <p>And these were the actual windmills mentioned in the book, so my guide says - unless it was the ones near Consuegra, 30 miles away, or the ones at . . . and so forth. It doesn't matter. This is the vision the valorous knight saw. </p> <p>Spend any time in La Mancha and you'll realise there isn't one, but many of them: the agricultural ground beneath your feet, hundreds of miles of scorched wheatfields and tough vineyards, still peasant-owned; the historical palaces and castles, the straight roads still murmuring the stories of trader and Moor, soldier and Christian, Jew and king and mystic; the gastronomic home of baked game and cheese \"harder than plaster of Paris\"; not to mention the mythic landscape of a tormented madman and his loyal fat squire who have held our imagination for 400 years. </p> <p>The guide at Campo de Criptana said - I'm not sure I believe this one, but it's a good story - that a Japanese tourist once asked him which was the exact windmill Quixote had tilted at. When told that Cervantes' account was only a story, he turned on his heel and broke the dreadful news to his fellow countrymen. They got back on the bus then and there, crushed by the loss of their illusions. </p> <p>Maybe their belief in Cervantes' characters would have been more kindly treated in El Toboso, a village of silent, charming corners that rings periodically with the burble of sheep bells or the Angelus. Tucked behind the parish church of San Antonio Abad is the \"house of Dulcinea\", a farmhouse restored and furnished as it would have been in the 16th century. On the first floor, entering the bedroom of a woman who did not exist, with its handsome gothic bedstead, even I felt a burst of sympathy for the gallant, unrequited knight. </p> <p>Reaching Almagro that night, I stayed in the parador of the former convent of Santa Catalina. Almagro is a nodal point in Spanish history: white and aristocratic, it reverberates with elderly grace and the echoes of lost power. An extraordinary calm overcame me after dinner as I sat reading a novel. </p> <p>The choice of book was apt: it was Eduardo Mendoza's The Year of the Flood, one of the best novels to come out of Spain in the post-Franco era. In his story of Sister Consuelo, seduced by a philandering landowner as she campaigns to raise funds for a hospital for the poor, there is a deep vein of Don Quixote's moral idealism. The altruism that gets him into deep trouble does likewise for Sister Consuelo - but at the end of a long life of charity, what she takes with her on her deathbed isn't the satisfaction of the hospitals she has built, but the memory of her one small sin and the joy that she was loved. </p> <p>As the director of Madrid's Cervantes Institute, Francisco Marcos Mar\u00edn, had said to me a few days before, when we had spent a morning talking about how spectacularly Cervantes' influence had flown around the world and never waned: \"Illusion and reality, you see.

      "body": "<p>There it was. After hours spent looking for a sense of direction in Dubai's luxurious shopping malls, the perfect gift suddenly loomed into view. It is not often that I have ever felt in need of a corporate stress chair but in Dubai, playground of the moneyed classes, the thought of diving into it was the stuff of fantasy. </p> <p>The corporate stress chair was a plump, flesh-coloured monster into which any fatigued and despairing executive would gladly slump. It had flat arms on which to rest the corporate mobile phone and a copious centre for the executive bottom. Remarkably, there was no queue. In Dubai, one of the fastest-growing holiday destinations around, the corporate mind was far more de-stressed than mine. </p> <p>On the first night, in the lift of the Jumeirah Beach Hotel - adored by pampered executives worldwide and boasting more bars and restaurants than a decent-sized English town - a flushed fortysomething English businessman briefly switched his attention from his glamorous acquaintance to deliver the most commonly-heard speech in town. \"They used to think we were suffering here,\" he said. \"They'd all say, 'Dubai! Bad luck!' Now they're catching on to what a ball we're having. It's getting worrying.\" </p> <p>I think he saw through my clumsy nod of agreement, because he looked at me as if I was from a different world. He had immediately sussed that I had no idea that the Boardwalk at the Dubai Creek Yacht Club was currently the place to chill out in town, or that Trader Vic's was the best venue for exotic drinks. That advice, by the way, might already be out of date. In Dubai, everybody strives to be fashionable. Places are full one week, empty the next; the new gimmick never far away. </p> <p>Here, on the edge of the Arabian sea, business and recreation mingle, guilt free. The time will soon arrive in this strange, sophis ticated world of business leisure when beach sun loungers come with their own fax machine, and video-conferencing facilities will be attached to every hotel exercise bike. </p> <p>Dubai is a vast monument to wealth, each new building trying to outdo the rest. The destination that likes to bill itself as entirely 21st century has pretty much missed out on every other century along the way. Take a poor desert fishing community, add the sudden discovery of huge oil reserves and, within half a century or so, the result is a breeding ground for all the joys that modern technology can offer. Dubai has been called a modern slave society, but the Europeans and Asians who swell the 70,000 Arab population to 10 times that figure, and happily accept limited rights, are slaves only to money. </p> <p>\"Superfluous wealth can buy superfluities only,\" said American naturalist Henry Thoreau. Nonsense, they will tell you in Dubai. Why, it can buy you an R9 Chronograph or luggage so expensive it will not even look at another suitcase on the carousel without a prior introduction. It allows you to adorn yourself with \"Claudia Schiffer's favourite jewellery\" and it can make you an expert on the window functions of the latest digital camera. All de rigueur , naturally, and never more so than during the annual shopping festival in March. </p> <p>All I had bought in this commercial wonderland was six music cassettes for a total of \u00a318, and my illegal taxi driver, Rajan, had fared little better, disappearing for a while in search of some genuine-fake Calvin Klein jeans and returning with the complaint that \"they don't fake them like they used to\". Then I thought, to hell with it, why not wallow in it all. So I did. </p> <p>There are plush hotels and plush hotels. But no hotel can be as blatantly, ostentatiously and stupendously wealthy as the Burj Al Arab. Opened late last year and shaped like a giant sail, it sits 280m out to sea, across from the Jumeirah Beach Hotel. And it changes colour at night. Even for the most hardened cynic, it took the breath away. It is wealth as pornography: everything flaunted, nothing to discover. </p> <p>The Burj Al Arab likes to be known as the tallest hotel in the world. There are official figures for the amount of gold leaf used in its construction. There can be no more stunning atrium in the world. The gymnasium pool is so luxurious that swimmers must pile on the pounds with every length. If you thought an Emirates flight was about as comfortable as it gets, guests at the Burj Al Arab are invited to complete their journey by Rolls-Royce, helicopter or boat. But the most frivolous trip of all is that made to the Al Mahara seafood restaurant: you reach it by a simulated three-minute submarine trip. Is there any more nonsensical job in the world than that of Hemake, the captain of an imaginary submarine? </p> <p>With wealth, however, comes uncertainty. When the doorbell rings in your $1,000-a-night suite, a widescreen, interactive TV automatically projects the image of the caller on to the screen. The facility has yet to be invented where any unwelcome visitors are automatically fed to the sharks in the restaurant aquarium, but it is only a matter of time. </p> <p>There are plenty of attractions in and around Dubai, other than lolling in hotel luxury, even if a group of dubious Russian businessmen reputedly had travelled no further than the Burj Al Arab pool table since the hotel opened. The bird sanctuary at Khor Dubai, a few minutes' drive from the World Trade Centre, and housing flocks of once-hunted giant flamingos offers a nice contrast.Water sports abound and, presumably, if the coral ever disappears, the emirate will simply tip tons of priceless gems on the seabed and let the snorkellers gaze upon them instead. There are two championship-standard golf courses, which, in an emirate blessed with a maximum of five days' rain a year, makes one wonder about sustainable resources; shooting ranges; go-karting; ice skating; and race meetings. As for top international sporting events, Dubai has little difficulty in buying them in. </p> <p>But if you yearn for a sense of history, forget it. In the Wafi shopping mall one evening, where the wealthiest Arabs often congregate, Pinky Handicrafts, of Sharjah, held a display of imported Indian antique furniture. One Arab sheltered behind an ancient cabinet, murmuring into the latest flip-top mobile. It was an uncommon connection of old and new. I often wondered if I was the only person in Dubai without a mobile. They went off incessantly.

      "bodyText": "There it was. After hours spent looking for a sense of direction in Dubai's luxurious shopping malls, the perfect gift suddenly loomed into view. It is not often that I have ever felt in need of a corporate stress chair but in Dubai, playground of the moneyed classes, the thought of diving into it was the stuff of fantasy. The corporate stress chair was a plump, flesh-coloured monster into which any fatigued and despairing executive would gladly slump. It had flat arms on which to rest the corporate mobile phone and a copious centre for the executive bottom. Remarkably, there was no queue. In Dubai, one of the fastest-growing holiday destinations around, the corporate mind was far more de-stressed than mine. On the first night, in the lift of the Jumeirah Beach Hotel - adored by pampered executives worldwide and boasting more bars and restaurants than a decent-sized English town - a flushed fortysomething English businessman briefly switched his attention from his glamorous acquaintance to deliver the most commonly-heard speech in town. \"They used to think we were suffering here,\" he said. \"They'd all say, 'Dubai! Bad luck!' Now they're catching on to what a ball we're having. It's getting worrying.\" I think he saw through my clumsy nod of agreement, because he looked at me as if I was from a different world. He had immediately sussed that I had no idea that the Boardwalk at the Dubai Creek Yacht Club was currently the place to chill out in town, or that Trader Vic's was the best venue for exotic drinks. That advice, by the way, might already be out of date. In Dubai, everybody strives to be fashionable. Places are full one week, empty the next; the new gimmick never far away. Here, on the edge of the Arabian sea, business and recreation mingle, guilt free. The time will soon arrive in this strange, sophis ticated world of business leisure when beach sun loungers come with their own fax machine, and video-conferencing facilities will be attached to every hotel exercise bike. Dubai is a vast monument to wealth, each new building trying to outdo the rest. The destination that likes to bill itself as entirely 21st century has pretty much missed out on every other century along the way. Take a poor desert fishing community, add the sudden discovery of huge oil reserves and, within half a century or so, the result is a breeding ground for all the joys that modern technology can offer. Dubai has been called a modern slave society, but the Europeans and Asians who swell the 70,000 Arab population to 10 times that figure, and happily accept limited rights, are slaves only to money. \"Superfluous wealth can buy superfluities only,\" said American naturalist Henry Thoreau. Nonsense, they will tell you in Dubai. Why, it can buy you an R9 Chronograph or luggage so expensive it will not even look at another suitcase on the carousel without a prior introduction. It allows you to adorn yourself with \"Claudia Schiffer's favourite jewellery\" and it can make you an expert on the window functions of the latest digital camera. All de rigueur , naturally, and never more so than during the annual shopping festival in March. All I had bought in this commercial wonderland was six music cassettes for a total of \u00a318, and my illegal taxi driver, Rajan, had fared little better, disappearing for a while in search of some genuine-fake Calvin Klein jeans and returning with the complaint that \"they don't fake them like they used to\". Then I thought, to hell with it, why not wallow in it all. So I did. There are plush hotels and plush hotels. But no hotel can be as blatantly, ostentatiously and stupendously wealthy as the Burj Al Arab. Opened late last year and shaped like a giant sail, it sits 280m out to sea, across from the Jumeirah Beach Hotel. And it changes colour at night. Even for the most hardened cynic, it took the breath away. It is wealth as pornography: everything flaunted, nothing to discover. The Burj Al Arab likes to be known as the tallest hotel in the world. There are official figures for the amount of gold leaf used in its construction. There can be no more stunning atrium in the world.

      "bodyText": "Black civil servants are being held back from promotion because of racism at the highest levels of the Whitehall machine, a new report reveals. The report's findings came as the government yesterday attempted to defend itself against accusations that it had fuelled racism with its recent handling of asylum and immigration. Transport and General Workers Union general secretary Bill Morris accused ministers of creating a \"climate of fear\" through its efforts to appear tough on bogus asylum seekers and illegal immigrants. The union leader is understood to have been infuriated for weeks by the rhetoric coming from senior ministers, as well as a remark by the Home Office minister, Mike O'Brien, that the Home Office itself was institutionally racist. The government wheeled out its most prominent black minister, the Home Office minister Paul Boateng, to defend its record. He said that it had worked \"to create a fair, just and tolerant society, not simply in commissioning Sir William Macpherson's report, but also in strengthening the race relations law, creating nine new criminal offences to tackle racial violence, and in a range of policies across government, recognising that there are deep-rooted patterns of disadvantage and discrimination in our society\". Mr Boateng denied the government's actions on the issue of asylum indicated racial discrimination on its part. However the government's efforts to counter Mr Morris were not helped by two separate reports into racism within the public service. A report by the Institute of Employment Studies for the cabinet office has revealed black people are not only disproportionately represented in lower civil service grades, but also receive lower perfor mance markings. The report blamed the possible racist perceptions of senior civil servants. It revealed endemic racism in the promotion of staff, including the Home Office. The report found: \"White staff have a generally higher distribution of box, or performance markings than Asian staff and particularly than black staff although Asian staff achieve proportionally more box ones in certain categories'. \"The differences between white and non-white staff are statistically significant overall and at each grade taking the population as a whole.\" Ethnic minority staff appear to be the only group which exhibits lower performance markings and a skewed distribution of staff's numbers towards lower grades. The percentage of ethnic minorities varies widely from department to department including from 1.8% in the Minsistry of Defence to 11.9% in the Department of Environ ment and 11.8% in the Home Office. Another report by the Home Office - 'Race Equality' in the public services - makes equally sobering reading for the home secretary, Jack Straw, who has made it a personal campaign to reduce racism in the public sector. The report discussed society's overall employment rates finding that over the past 15 years rates have risen for most ethnic minority groups at a similar rate as white people. However, the employment rates amongst ethnic minority groups are lower with 79% of white people employed and only 57% of Pakistan or Bangladeshi men, a differential that is virtually unchanged over the past decade. It also showed that white pensioners' median income is \u00a3136, against \u00a3114 for black people. A total of 24 % of black people in spring 1999 were in workless households, compared with 12% for white people. The government has defended its record, pointing out that the head of the civil service, Sir Richard Wilson, has set demanding targets to imporve the promotion propsects of ethnic minority staff.",

His watery, ill-looking face in Van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait (1434) in the National Gallery must be pretty much what Arnolfini looked like. This is a real face. The cleft chin, the heavy-lidded half-asleep eyes were painted again by Van Eyck several years later; there is no reason to think he made them up. </p> <p>The date - 1434 - is precise because Van Eyck painted it above the mirror at the back of the room, with the graffiti declaration \"Jan Van Eyck was here\". He was here more than half a millennium ago. And these two people, an Italian merchant resident in Bruges and his wife, stand before us. They are here, now. </p> <p>People said Van Eyck was an alchemist, and no wonder. There is some enchantment about this painting, the way it seems to act as a window on a real room. It has become more, not less, mysterious as art historians have attempted to establish its context. There have been many classic interpretations, including an analysis by Erwin Panofsky arguing that it was painted as a legal document witnessing a marriage. It is now known all of these arguments were based on a misrecognition of the picture. It was always thought to be of the merchant Giovanni di Arrigo Arnolfini and his bride Giovanna Cenami. Recently, a document turned up showing they did not marry until 14 years after this picture was done. It is not them. </p> <p>Perhaps it is another member of the same merchant family, Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini, and his unnamed second wife. No one can be sure. This is a painting whose every detail seems to tell us something. Is the little dog an emblem of lust, signifying the couple's desire to have a baby in that big red bed, as the art historian Craig Harbison has argued? Or is it an image of Christian fidelity? Is the woman alluding to her desire to be pregnant by bunching her dress on her stomach? Or is it just that - as we can see in other paintings by him - Van Eyck liked to paint women with big stomachs? </p> <p>There is only one certainty. This looks like a real world, with real people. The key to the picture is the mirror on the wall. A mirror is something you look in to comb your hair, to see how you look. It is a portrait machine. This is a convex mirror, which just happens to look like a camera lens. It takes in the whole room, the backs of the man and woman, and two small figures coming in through the door - the people the little dog is looking at and Arnolfini seems to be weakly saluting. Us. The mirror, so significantly placed between the couple, is an image of what this painting claims to be: a true reflection. </p> <p>This is what Van Eyck promises his sitters centuries before the invention of photography, in this painting which is an advert for his art. Your face, your wife's face, your dog's face, caught as truly as when you look in the mirror before going out to sell some fine Italian silks: Jan Van Eyck can record these for you. </p> <p>The artist and Arnolfini were courtiers of the Burgundian duke, Philip the Good, but how many of us know anything about Philip the Good? This affluent couple have got what the pharaohs thought they could achieve through mummification. They are preserved, along with their dog, their fine clothes, and their oranges. The meaning of this painting is that wealth - the wealth to hire Van Eyck - can purchase immortality, even if no one will be quite sure what your name was. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Arnolfini Portrait is at the National Gallery, London WC2 (0171-306 0055).</p>",

Recently, a document turned up showing they did not marry until 14 years after this picture was done. It is not them. Perhaps it is another member of the same merchant family, Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini, and his unnamed second wife. No one can be sure. This is a painting whose every detail seems to tell us something. Is the little dog an emblem of lust, signifying the couple's desire to have a baby in that big red bed, as the art historian Craig Harbison has argued? Or is it an image of Christian fidelity? Is the woman alluding to her desire to be pregnant by bunching her dress on her stomach? Or is it just that - as we can see in other paintings by him - Van Eyck liked to paint women with big stomachs? There is only one certainty. This looks like a real world, with real people. The key to the picture is the mirror on the wall. A mirror is something you look in to comb your hair, to see how you look. It is a portrait machine. This is a convex mirror, which just happens to look like a camera lens. It takes in the whole room, the backs of the man and woman, and two small figures coming in through the door - the people the little dog is looking at and Arnolfini seems to be weakly saluting. Us. The mirror, so significantly placed between the couple, is an image of what this painting claims to be: a true reflection. This is what Van Eyck promises his sitters centuries before the invention of photography, in this painting which is an advert for his art. Your face, your wife's face, your dog's face, caught as truly as when you look in the mirror before going out to sell some fine Italian silks: Jan Van Eyck can record these for you. The artist and Arnolfini were courtiers of the Burgundian duke, Philip the Good, but how many of us know anything about Philip the Good? This affluent couple have got what the pharaohs thought they could achieve through mummification. They are preserved, along with their dog, their fine clothes, and their oranges. The meaning of this painting is that wealth - the wealth to hire Van Eyck - can purchase immortality, even if no one will be quite sure what your name was. \u00b7 The Arnolfini Portrait is at the National Gallery, London WC2 (0171-306 0055).",

The Kodak Manufacturing Training Scheme, known to its friends as the Seedcorn Programme, is targeted at graduates with a chemistry, physics or engineering degree. The scheme provides a comprehensive understanding of the company's manufacturing operation through a series of assignments over a two-year period. Each assignment may be spent in any of the many departments at Kodak's four UK sites. Emphasis is placed on manufacturing areas, although one assignment in a commercial role or business unit is encouraged. For the length of the programme, each seedcorn graduate is assigned a mentor - usually a member of senior management who has volunteered to be the main point of contact throughout the period. Every employee receives a minimum of 40 hours training per year which, says the company, gives them the opportunity to develop their full potential. Details of Kodak's 2001 Seedcorn Programme and current vacancies are available from the Personnel Dept, Ref S687/DPS, Kodak Limited, Headstone Drive, Harrow, Middlesex HA1 4TY.",

      "body": "<p>The coastline of Washington State, in the far Northwest of America, can be a melancholy place. The beaches stretch for miles and the sea mists roll in from the Pacific, shrouding everything in a milky light. When the ocean wind blows on-shore, inch-high sand storms whip across bare ankles. But such conditions are perfect for one hardy breed of beach bum. </p> <p>In a fresh wind on Long Beach, north of the mouth of the Columbia River, you will find an array of brightly-coloured kites fluttering in the sky. Box kites, delta wings, tandem kites... take your pick. Chances are that at the other end of the strings will be an elderly man or woman, watching their devices loop-the-loop and nose-dive to within inches of the beach before soaring high again. It has become a popular pastime for pensioners who retire here to buy a kite and spend long days watching the wind play with it, 100 or so feet above the ground. </p> <p>Small, quiet towns, such as Long Beach and neighbouring Seaview, are ideal to while away the \"silver years\" as the politically-correct American marketeers like to describe old age. The pace of life is slow, the air invigorating, the food healthy, and the crime rate virtually non-existent. </p> <p>Jim Buesing is a 65-year-old retired benefits administrator. He also ran a kite shop for 13 years and helped set up the Kite Museum in Long Beach. In it hang some fantastic creations - many of them exotic and colourful constructions from Indonesia and China. They are far too precious to risk in a Pacific wind, so the most flying they do is from wall to wall whenever the exhibit is rearranged. </p> <p>The morning I met him on the beach, Jim was struggling to get a small kite launched from the back of his pick-up truck. \"This is a miniature parafoil - a bit like a parachute - and I've never flown this one before,\" he said, deftly uncoiling his body from the string. </p> <p>He walked 10 paces away from the truck towards the boardwalk and, watched by attentive seagulls, launched the kite. The first row of the audience scattered with a squawk, thinking it was a huge eagle come to steal their young. The kite rose noisily, the wind battering the squares of material, until it settled in a current of more gentle air about 90ft off the ground. </p> <p>\"Now you just wait and watch,\" he said. \"That's the beauty of kite-flying: you don't do a whole lot. It's very relaxing, non-polluting and healthy. </p> <p>\"It's a real cleansing of the mind,\" he continued. \"At least it is at this time of year. You should see this place in mid-August.\" </p> <p>The annual international kite festival runs from August 20-26, when competitors from the UK, Germany, Japan and Australia turn up to take each other on in aerial dog-fights. Flyers score points by bashing into rival kites and downing them by wrapping their string around their victim's. \"It can get rowdy, too. There are barbecues on the beach and quite a lot of celebrating,\" said Jim. </p> <p>This year there will be the usual parade of fun kites - 80ft-high frogs and octopi have appeared in the past. Competitors will try to beat the Western hemisphere record for the most kites in the sky at one time and the end of the festival is marked by an illuminated aerial display. </p> <p>If, like me, you graduated from the Charlie Brown school of kite-flying and your tethered charge is drawn to trees, telegraph poles and chimneypots, then it pays to keep out of the way of the professionals during the festival. But with a beach said to be the longest in the world at 28 miles, there is plenty of room to practise on your own. </p> <p>Kite-flying may not involve much physical exertion, but a mixture of fresh air and concentration is enough to build an appetite. Food is the other thing this coastline is famous for. North of the Long Beach peninsula lies Willapa Bay, which produces wonderful oysters. But don't stop at the starters. At the 19th-century Shelburne Inn, on the Pacific Highway in Seaview, the salmon is full of flavour. </p> <p>Views from most of the hotels along the coast are good, but among the best are those from the Boreas Guesthouse in Long Beach. Eagle perches have been erected at the back of the house in the dunes, so guests can watch the giant birds. </p> <p>You get a great sense of space up here in America's Pacific Northwest, and such freedom makes the Washington State coastline ideal for holiday-makers seeking peace and relaxation. There is little to do other than to admire the ravishing scenery and wildlife, dine on the most wonderful seafood and, er, fly kites.</p> <p><strong>Flying Circus</strong></p> <p><strong> April 16 <br> Spring Kite Flying Day</strong>, Stafford Castle, Newport Road, Staffordshire <br> Details: 0121-360 1955 </p> <p><strong> April 23 &amp; 24 <br> Blackheath Easter Kite Festival</strong>, Blackheath, London <br> Details: 020-8302 8203 </p> <p><strong> May 1 <br> Weymouth International Beach Kite Festival</strong>, Weymouth Beach Dorset <br> Call the Kite Society for more details on 01206 271489 </p> <p><strong> May 14 <br> Suffolk Kite Festival</strong>, Rougham Airfield, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk <br> Details: 01473 464095 </p> <p><strong> May 27 - 29 <br> 4th Tewkesbury Kite Fun Weekend</strong>, Gloucestershire<br> Details: 01684 295132 </p> <p><strong> June 11 <br> East Coast Kite Festival</strong>, Dovercourt, Essex <br> Details: 01255 221059 </p> <p><strong> June 17-18 <br> 8th London Kite Festival</strong>, Hackney Marshes, London <br> Includes Britain's only urban kite buggy competition.

He said he had felt \"blind, terrified, vulnerable\" when he heard people entering his home.</p> <p>He admits having fired a gun but denies murdering Fred Barras, 16, and denies attempting to murder Brendan Fearon, 30, both of Newark in Nottinghamshire. He denies wounding Fearon with intent to commit grievous bodily harm, and denies possessing a Winchester 12-bore pump action shotgun with intent to endanger life. He admits possessing a shotgun without a certificate.</p> <p>He told yesterday how he had been asleep in bed, fully clothed, when he heard noises downstairs in his farmhouse. \"I just heard a horrendous noise. I thought I was in a horror movie. There was a banging noise. It sounded like somebody coming up the stairs.</p> <p>\"I tried to avoid the situation ... and then I had to get down to reality.

I became fearful.\"</p> <p>He went back to his bedroom where he kept a gun, the jury heard. \"I loaded it and stood there with it. I was still hearing this terrific banging. There was a noise downstairs, so I went on to the landing.\"</p> <p>A light was shone in his face. \"I think it was a torch. I had the impression I was on the stairs. The light came from the doorway downstairs. It went straight in my face. I was very frightened. Lots of things go through your mind. Blind, terrified, vulnerable.\"</p> <p>Martin told the court that he then fired the gun, but he did not know how many times. He aimed below the light and thought he was firing at the bottom of the doorway.</p> <p>Anthony Scrivener QC, Martin's barrister, told the jury that the issue in the trial was self-defence. Martin knew that an unknown number of people had broken into his dark, isolated house. He did not know if they were armed or under the influence of drugs.</p> <p>They had not been put off by Martin's three rottweilers, said Mr Scrivener, and were not bothered about him being in the house.</p> <p>\"What would you do?\" he asked the jury. \"Say 'hold on chaps, can we discuss this rationally?'\" Mr Scrivener said that in law any citizen had the right to kill in self-defence if he believed he was being attacked.</p> <p>The judge, Mr Justice Owen, said the jury must weigh up whether Martin believed it was necessary to use force, and whether the force he used was reasonable.</p> <p>Yesterday the judge issued an order preventing identification of the defence's witnesses.</p> <p>Det Sgt Peter Newton, questioned by Mr Scrivener, said that only three or four officers on the case, and Martin's solicitor, knew the address where Martin, who is on bail, was staying. He confirmed the contract threat had been made. Asked if police had advised Martin never to go back to his farmhouse, Mr Newton said that was for him to decide - but police had made it clear to him they could not protect him for the rest of his life.</p> <p>The trial was adjourned until Monday.</p> <p>Meanwhile, police released pictures of inside Martin's almost-derelict house, taken shortly after the shootings. The jurors have been taken to view the house. The prosecution has alleged that the staircase was \"booby-trapped\" by Martin, with steps at top and bottom removed. In another picture, the window frame wrenched out by Fearon can be seen lying on the floor.</p>",

The judge, Mr Justice Owen, said the jury must weigh up whether Martin believed it was necessary to use force, and whether the force he used was reasonable. Yesterday the judge issued an order preventing identification of the defence's witnesses. Det Sgt Peter Newton, questioned by Mr Scrivener, said that only three or four officers on the case, and Martin's solicitor, knew the address where Martin, who is on bail, was staying. He confirmed the contract threat had been made. Asked if police had advised Martin never to go back to his farmhouse, Mr Newton said that was for him to decide - but police had made it clear to him they could not protect him for the rest of his life. The trial was adjourned until Monday. Meanwhile, police released pictures of inside Martin's almost-derelict house, taken shortly after the shootings. The jurors have been taken to view the house. The prosecution has alleged that the staircase was \"booby-trapped\" by Martin, with steps at top and bottom removed. In another picture, the window frame wrenched out by Fearon can be seen lying on the floor.",

      "bodyText": "The showdown over the fate of Elian Gonzalez yesterday spawned a clutch of court cases as lawyers for the US government and the Cuban boy's Miami relatives embarked on intricate and conflicting manoeuvres to determine the future of the celebrated six-year-old. The justice department applied for a federal order to reinforce its ruling that Elian should be returned to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who flew from Cuba more than a week ago to collect his child. The move reflected the reluctance of the US attorney general, Janet Reno, to send federal officials into the Miami home where Elian has been staying since he was shipwrecked in November to take the boy from his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. Immigration officials were yesterday reported to be rehearsing a raid on the house, using mainly female officers wearing civilian clothes instead of uniforms to minimise damaging publicity. But Lazaro Gonzalez's house in Miami's Little Havana remained ringed by an encampment of defiant Cuban exiles braving heavy rain to maintain their routine of prayers and anti-communist chants. Insisting that Elian's repatriation to Communist Cuba would constitute a violation of his human rights, they have vowed to present a human barrier to any government attempt to remove him, and to ensure that any attempt to enforce Ms Reno's orders would create an ugly scene. Justice department officials said yesterday they hoped a raid would not be necessary. They warned that if Lazaro Gonzalez defied the federal court order the department was seeking, he would be in contempt and face a jail term. Lazaro Gonzalez has said repeatedly he would not offer resistance to any government attempt to move Elian, but nor would he deliver the boy to the authorities. He has maintained that the boy's father, Juan Miguel, is being coerced by Fidel Castro's government and does not really want to return to Cuba - a claim Juan Miguel has rejected. Lawyers for Lazaro won an injunction on Thursday preventing Elian's return to Cuba. The government countered yesterday by offering to prevent Mr Gonzalez from leaving with his son until an appeal by the Miami relatives against the repatriation could be heard next month. But that offer was conditional on Elian being returned to his father. The Cuban American National Foundation, an exile group which has funded the Miami relatives' legal costs, embarked on yet another court case in Washington yesterday, seeking to prevent the US government from sending Elian back to Cuba unless it could guarantee his rights would not be infringed by the government in Havana. Juan Miguel Gonzalez has begun to show signs of strain. He was said to be furious at the broadcast on Thursday of a video made by Elian's Miami relatives in which the boy repeatedly insisted he did not want to go back to Cuba. Most psychologists agreed his performance appeared to have been heavily coached, and the Los Angeles Times compared it to \"the unsettling spectacle of a POW mouthing the words of his captors\". Defending the video yesterday, a Cuban American National Foundation spokesman said: \"I can understand the frustration of the Miami family, who have been saying for months that the little boy has not been heard.\" Useful links Campaign to keep Elian in US Let Elian go home Cubanet Department of State: The US and Cuba",

      "body": "<p>When I went to see Judge Charles Gray in his chambers, the day before his first hearing in the David Irving libel trial that ended this week, he confessed anxiety. \"There is some risk,\" he explained, \"of one's being asked to become a historian. Judges aren't historians.\" </p> <p>For their own reasons, both sides agreed that (whatever else the trial was about), history, in Leopold von Ranke's phrase, \"what actually happened,\" had no place in the courtroom. But facts have a kind of gravitational pull of their own, and by the end, everyone involved - Gray, Irving, Deborah Lipstadt, her lawyers, the experts who testified and those of us who merely listened - spent a great deal of time hearing about what happened to the Jews of Europe and about how the knowledge of what happened has been preserved. </p> <p>Unlike myth, history is not tidy, and the events that became known as the Holocaust are as complex as any genuine - as opposed to literary - calamity. There is the added confusion created by the efforts of the perpetrators to cover-up their crimes. But there was also a final bar to understanding perhaps unique to the Holocaust - that we believe we already know all about it. Of all the \"lessons\" of the Holocaust, Pastor Martin Niem\u00f6ller's account of his own complicity in the escalating brutality of life in Nazi Germany is probably the best known. His litany of indifference, \"First they came for the Jews, but I was not a Jew...\" is one of the things everybody knows about the Holocaust, along with the bars of soap made from the fat of murdered Jews, and the gas chambers at Dachau and Belsen. But what everybody knows about the Holocaust isn't always true. </p> <p>Although the grisly tale of the soap figured in some of the earliest accounts of Nazi-occupied Europe, it is now rejected by historians as a fabrication - similar to the atrocity stories of Allied propaganda during the first world war. Dachau did have a gas chamber, but it was never used. This week the BBC referred to the \"death camp\" at Belsen, but there were no gas chambers at Belsen. </p> <p>Nor did the Nazis come first for the Jews; as Peter Novick explains in his brilliant and provocative new book, The Holocaust in American Life, \"First they came for the Communists\" - a circumstance acknowledged by Niem\u00f6ller, who continued, \"but I was not a Communist - so I said nothing. Then they came for the Social Democrats, but I was not a Social Democrat - so I did nothing. Then came the trade unionists, but I was not a trade unionist. And then they came for the Jews, but I was not a Jew - so I did little. Then when they came for me, there was no one left who could stand up for me.\" The Holocaust Museum in Washington DC is just one of those who, in Novick's phrase \"prudently omits\" Communists from Niem\u00f6ller's homily. </p> <p>But prudence and political calculation have influenced our knowledge of the Holocaust from the beginning. Even the word itself - from the Greek holos, for whole, and kaustos, for burnt - is contested. In some circles, the Hebrew word Shoah, meaning destruction, is preferred. The Princeton historian Arno Mayer coined the term \"Judeocide\" to describe the subject of his study Why Did the Heavens Not Darken? For a long time after the war, the fate of European Jewry was hardly mentioned, partly because, as the cartoonist Art Spiegelman's father says in Maus, his survivor's tale in cartoon format, \"No one wants anyway to hear such stories,\" and partly because in camps liberated by British and American troops including Dachau, Belsen and Buchenwald, only a minority of the prisoners were Jews. In Ed Murrow's famous 1945 broadcast from Buchenwald the words Jew and Jewish are never spoken. </p> <p>In her first book, Beyond Belief, Lipstadt wrote that even when confronted by the evidence, many correspondents were reluctant to admit to themselves and their readers the reality of genocide. She attributes some reluctance to anti-Semitism. Novick, who teaches history at the University of Chicago, suggests a different reason for postwar reticence: with the realignment of the cold war, talk of the Holocaust was inimical to US interests. In 50s America few besides Communists shouted \"Remember the six million!\" </p> <p>For most Americans, including Jews, the Holocaust was \"the wrong atrocity\" - mention of it was at best an embarrassment, at worst a cause for suspicion. Today the Holocaust is ubiquitous. Films such as Schindler's List, television programmes, novels, memoirs all add to what we know - or think we know - about what Raul Hilberg called \"the destruction of the European Jews\". His book with that title was published in 1961. The first reviews were mostly hostile: it was years before Hilberg won prizes. Merely consider the reception of Binjamin Wilkomirski's Fragments (1995) to see how much has changed: it won the National Jewish Book Award for autobiography. Even after evidence mounted that Wilkomirski was really Bruno D\u00f6ssekker, a Swiss musician whose account of a childhood in the camps is fictional, Fragments attracted readers, such is the appetite for Holocaust literature. </p> <p>How did this change come about? Novick mentions a gradual easing of the cold war, outbreaks of neo-Nazism in Germany and the US, the 1952 publication of Anne Frank: The Diary of A Young Girl, adapted to stage and screen. But the single greatest catalyst was the trial of war criminal Adolf Eichmann. Much of the initial response was negative. But as the trial wore on, the mass of detail overcame scepticism. The trial was televised, and for the first time the American public was confronted with the Holocaust distinct from the general carnage of war. </p> <p>Now, nearly 40 years after, Eichmann's name again echoed in a court. For over nine weeks in Courtroom 73 of the Royal Courts of Justice the Holocaust has been on trial as Charles Gray presided over David Irving v. Penguin Books Ltd and Deborah Lipstadt. Towards the end of the trial, which, thanks to British libel laws, forced Lipstadt to prove the truth of the claim in her book Denying the Holocaust that Irving knowingly distorted or suppressed evidence regarding the Nazi massacre of European Jewry, it was announced that the Israeli authorities had agreed to release Eichmann's diaries. But the problem of Lipstadt and her lawyers couldn't be solved by new evidence. The problem was how to interpret what was already there. </p> <p>To Irving, author of numerous books on the Third Reich, the Holocaust is \"an ill-fitting legend\". He didn't deny many Jews died; he denied that any of them were killed in gas chambers, that Hitler directly ordered the annihilation of Jewry, and that the killings were in any significant way different from the war's other atrocities. </p> <p>In Hilberg's insight, the destruction of European Jewry was a bureaucratic process, the result of \"a series of administrative measures\". In their pursuit of the Endl\u00f6sung - the Final Solution to the Jewish question - the Nazis left the detritus of any large organisation: memoranda, requisition forms, purchase orders and blueprints. A million Jews were murdered at Auschwitz and all had to be taken there by train in the middle of a war in which the railways were the lifelines of the German army. The Zyklon B gas to kill them had to be paid for. And the ovens that disposed of the bodies had to be specially built, by Topf and Sons, a firm that patented the design. For each St\u00fcck - piece, as the Nazis referred to a Jew - processed, items had to be accounted for: money, dental gold, hair. Hilberg mapped this bureaucracy in three volumes, but the essential facts are in a series of tables. Deaths by cause shows that more than 800,000 Jews died from \"ghetto-isation and general privation,\" more than 1.3m by \"open-air shootings,\" and up to 3m were murdered in camps - as many as 2.7m in specialised extermination centres such as Sobib\u00f3r, Treblinka, and Belzec; 150,000 died in other camps, including concentration camps such as Dachau and Buchenwald. </p> <p>In deaths by country, Hilberg's list ranges from the 3m Jews of Poland to the fewer than 1,000 from Luxembourg, and in deaths by year charts the genocide's rise and fall. But the total is the same: 5.1m Jews. Other historians dispute Hilberg's arithmetic, arguing for 6m. Scholars remain divided on when and why the Nazis shifted from encouraging Jewish emigration (which saved half of Germany's Jews) to extermination (which murdered 90% of Greece's Jews). They argue about the role of the camps in the German economy. </p> <p>Irving used these disagreements to get into the debate. But his arguments were of a different order. He filed for libel in September 1996; that spring, his US publishers, St Martin's Press, had cancelled the publication of his Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich. Given his history, controversy was to be expected, even courted. Publishers Weekly pronounced the book \"repellent\"; Jewish organisations expressed outrage; Deborah Lipstadt was quoted as saying that St Martin's would hardly sign up a white supremacist for a book on race relations. </p> <p>St Martin's at first stood firm, but between a March Daily News report about the uproar and Frank Rich's April New York Times column calling Irving \"Hitler's Spin Artist,\" it lost nerve and cancelled publication. The principal effect of this, as Christopher Hitchens pointed out in Vanity Fair, was to transform a man with \"depraved ideas\" about the Holocaust into a poster boy for free speech. This lent the book the cachet of suppressed literature. and gave rise to Gordon Craig's declaration, in a review in the New York Review of Books, that \"silencing Mr Irving would be a high price to pay for freedom from the annoyance that he causes us\". Craig continued: \"He knows more about National Socialism than most professional scholars in his field, and students of the years 1933-1945 owe more than they are always willing to admit\" to his research. \"Such people have an indispensable part in the historical enterprise, and we dare not disregard their views.\" On Tuesday, Mr Justice Gray found otherwise. </p> <p>The argument is familiar. In the late 70s, French intellectuals were convulsed over l'affaire Faurisson. Robert Faurisson, professor of literature at the University of Lyons, wrote in Le Monde the \"good news\" that the gas chambers had not existed. \"The alleged Hitlerian gas chambers,\" he said, \"and the so-called genocide of the Jews form a single historical lie whose principal beneficiaries are the State of Israel and international Zionism.\" </p> <p>Hitchens described Irving as \"not just a Fascist historian, but a great historian of Fascism\". He also assumed that what Irving really wanted was a debate with his critics. If that had been Irving's objective, all he had to do was bide his time. \"Someone,\" Hitchens asserted, \"will no doubt pick up where St Martin's left off.\" Instead, Irving blamed Lipstadt for his troubles in the US and sued her and her publisher, Penguin Books, for libel in England. At which point it became more difficult to defend the proposition that what was at stake was Irving's freedom of speech. </p> <p>Faurisson's chief antagonist, French classicist Pierre Vidal-Naquet, argued : \"To live with Faurisson? Any other attitude would imply that we were imposing historical truth as legal truth, which is a dangerous attitude.\" Vidal-Naquet opposed his government's use of torture in Algeria and supports the rights of Palestinians. Perhaps because both his parents were deported by the Nazis (his mother died in Auschwitz), he felt it just as important to expose Faurisson's distortions as to support his right to distort. His scepticism about the role of the state has no echo in Lipstadt, unlike his argument against debating the Holocaust. </p> <p>He wrote: \"Confronting an actual Eichmann, one had to resort to armed struggle and, if need be, to ruse. Confronting a paper Eichmann, one should respond with paper... In so doing, we are not placing ourselves on the same ground as our enemy. We do not debate him; we demonstrate the mechanisms of his lies and falsifications, which may be methodologically useful for the younger generations.\" We need only set this passage from Assassins of Memory, his restrained, yet devastating, response to Faurisson, beside a similar passage from Denying the Holocaust to see the extent of Lipstadt's indebtedness. \"Not ignoring the deniers does not mean engaging them in debate; it means not doing that. We cannot debate them for two reasons, one strategic and the other tactical... The deniers long to be considered the \"other\" side. Engaging them in discussion makes them exactly that. . They are contemptuous of the very tools that shape any honest debate: truth and reason. Debating with them would be like trying to nail a glob of jelly to the wall.\" Though she relies on his arguments, Lipstadt is no Vidal-Naquet. She lacks his intellectual breadth, clarity of thought and expression, and, sadly, his stature as a Jew who has never confined his political engagement to Jewish causes. </p> <p> In Israel, as you might expect in a country where in the 40s the slang for Holocaust survivor translated as soap, the battle over representing the Nazi genocide has always been bare-knuckled and open. The arguments go back to the war, when supporters of mainstream Zionism sought to discredit the Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People of Europe (agitating noisily for rescue) as a vehicle of the right-wing Zionist terrorist group Irgun. As indeed it was. David Ben-Gurion and other Zionist leaders were not thought lessly \"writing off\" European Jewry, Peter Novick says, but just making a \"chilling... appraisal of what was and was not possible\". </p> <p>Though it is impolite to mention it, there are still live questions about the Holocaust. The dispute between intentionalists, who say that genocide was always part of Hitler's plan, and functionalists, who argue the Final Solution evolved in response to changing conditions and fortunes of war, is far from settled. Another open, though stifled, question is about the number of survivors. Irving's claim that Jews inflated the number of victims to extort money from Germany merely demonstrates his ignorance. The payments to Israel were for resettling refugees, and it would have been in Israel's interest to exaggerate the number of survivors, not the number of victims. But that doesn't mean there weren't individuals who, to qualify for payment, claimed to have spent the war hiding in Poland when they had been living, in relative safety if not comfort, deep in the Soviet Union. </p> <p>More delicate is the question of survivor testimony. According to Elie Wiesel: \"Any survivor has more to say than all the historians combined about what happened.\" Would Wiesel censure Lipstadt for saying: \"Lots of survivors who arrived at Auschwitz will tell you they were examined by [Dr Josef] Mengele.

That is what historians do.

      "bodyText": "When I went to see Judge Charles Gray in his chambers, the day before his first hearing in the David Irving libel trial that ended this week, he confessed anxiety. \"There is some risk,\" he explained, \"of one's being asked to become a historian. Judges aren't historians.\" For their own reasons, both sides agreed that (whatever else the trial was about), history, in Leopold von Ranke's phrase, \"what actually happened,\" had no place in the courtroom. But facts have a kind of gravitational pull of their own, and by the end, everyone involved - Gray, Irving, Deborah Lipstadt, her lawyers, the experts who testified and those of us who merely listened - spent a great deal of time hearing about what happened to the Jews of Europe and about how the knowledge of what happened has been preserved. Unlike myth, history is not tidy, and the events that became known as the Holocaust are as complex as any genuine - as opposed to literary - calamity. There is the added confusion created by the efforts of the perpetrators to cover-up their crimes. But there was also a final bar to understanding perhaps unique to the Holocaust - that we believe we already know all about it. Of all the \"lessons\" of the Holocaust, Pastor Martin Niem\u00f6ller's account of his own complicity in the escalating brutality of life in Nazi Germany is probably the best known. His litany of indifference, \"First they came for the Jews, but I was not a Jew...\" is one of the things everybody knows about the Holocaust, along with the bars of soap made from the fat of murdered Jews, and the gas chambers at Dachau and Belsen. But what everybody knows about the Holocaust isn't always true. Although the grisly tale of the soap figured in some of the earliest accounts of Nazi-occupied Europe, it is now rejected by historians as a fabrication - similar to the atrocity stories of Allied propaganda during the first world war. Dachau did have a gas chamber, but it was never used. This week the BBC referred to the \"death camp\" at Belsen, but there were no gas chambers at Belsen. Nor did the Nazis come first for the Jews; as Peter Novick explains in his brilliant and provocative new book, The Holocaust in American Life, \"First they came for the Communists\" - a circumstance acknowledged by Niem\u00f6ller, who continued, \"but I was not a Communist - so I said nothing. Then they came for the Social Democrats, but I was not a Social Democrat - so I did nothing. Then came the trade unionists, but I was not a trade unionist. And then they came for the Jews, but I was not a Jew - so I did little. Then when they came for me, there was no one left who could stand up for me.\" The Holocaust Museum in Washington DC is just one of those who, in Novick's phrase \"prudently omits\" Communists from Niem\u00f6ller's homily. But prudence and political calculation have influenced our knowledge of the Holocaust from the beginning. Even the word itself - from the Greek holos, for whole, and kaustos, for burnt - is contested. In some circles, the Hebrew word Shoah, meaning destruction, is preferred. The Princeton historian Arno Mayer coined the term \"Judeocide\" to describe the subject of his study Why Did the Heavens Not Darken? For a long time after the war, the fate of European Jewry was hardly mentioned, partly because, as the cartoonist Art Spiegelman's father says in Maus, his survivor's tale in cartoon format, \"No one wants anyway to hear such stories,\" and partly because in camps liberated by British and American troops including Dachau, Belsen and Buchenwald, only a minority of the prisoners were Jews. In Ed Murrow's famous 1945 broadcast from Buchenwald the words Jew and Jewish are never spoken. In her first book, Beyond Belief, Lipstadt wrote that even when confronted by the evidence, many correspondents were reluctant to admit to themselves and their readers the reality of genocide. She attributes some reluctance to anti-Semitism. Novick, who teaches history at the University of Chicago, suggests a different reason for postwar reticence: with the realignment of the cold war, talk of the Holocaust was inimical to US interests. In 50s America few besides Communists shouted \"Remember the six million!\" For most Americans, including Jews, the Holocaust was \"the wrong atrocity\" - mention of it was at best an embarrassment, at worst a cause for suspicion. Today the Holocaust is ubiquitous. Films such as Schindler's List, television programmes, novels, memoirs all add to what we know - or think we know - about what Raul Hilberg called \"the destruction of the European Jews\". His book with that title was published in 1961. The first reviews were mostly hostile: it was years before Hilberg won prizes. Merely consider the reception of Binjamin Wilkomirski's Fragments (1995) to see how much has changed: it won the National Jewish Book Award for autobiography. Even after evidence mounted that Wilkomirski was really Bruno D\u00f6ssekker, a Swiss musician whose account of a childhood in the camps is fictional, Fragments attracted readers, such is the appetite for Holocaust literature. How did this change come about? Novick mentions a gradual easing of the cold war, outbreaks of neo-Nazism in Germany and the US, the 1952 publication of Anne Frank: The Diary of A Young Girl, adapted to stage and screen. But the single greatest catalyst was the trial of war criminal Adolf Eichmann. Much of the initial response was negative. But as the trial wore on, the mass of detail overcame scepticism. The trial was televised, and for the first time the American public was confronted with the Holocaust distinct from the general carnage of war. Now, nearly 40 years after, Eichmann's name again echoed in a court. For over nine weeks in Courtroom 73 of the Royal Courts of Justice the Holocaust has been on trial as Charles Gray presided over David Irving v. Penguin Books Ltd and Deborah Lipstadt. Towards the end of the trial, which, thanks to British libel laws, forced Lipstadt to prove the truth of the claim in her book Denying the Holocaust that Irving knowingly distorted or suppressed evidence regarding the Nazi massacre of European Jewry, it was announced that the Israeli authorities had agreed to release Eichmann's diaries. But the problem of Lipstadt and her lawyers couldn't be solved by new evidence. The problem was how to interpret what was already there. To Irving, author of numerous books on the Third Reich, the Holocaust is \"an ill-fitting legend\". He didn't deny many Jews died; he denied that any of them were killed in gas chambers, that Hitler directly ordered the annihilation of Jewry, and that the killings were in any significant way different from the war's other atrocities. In Hilberg's insight, the destruction of European Jewry was a bureaucratic process, the result of \"a series of administrative measures\". In their pursuit of the Endl\u00f6sung - the Final Solution to the Jewish question - the Nazis left the detritus of any large organisation: memoranda, requisition forms, purchase orders and blueprints. A million Jews were murdered at Auschwitz and all had to be taken there by train in the middle of a war in which the railways were the lifelines of the German army. The Zyklon B gas to kill them had to be paid for. And the ovens that disposed of the bodies had to be specially built, by Topf and Sons, a firm that patented the design. For each St\u00fcck - piece, as the Nazis referred to a Jew - processed, items had to be accounted for: money, dental gold, hair. Hilberg mapped this bureaucracy in three volumes, but the essential facts are in a series of tables. Deaths by cause shows that more than 800,000 Jews died from \"ghetto-isation and general privation,\" more than 1.3m by \"open-air shootings,\" and up to 3m were murdered in camps - as many as 2.7m in specialised extermination centres such as Sobib\u00f3r, Treblinka, and Belzec; 150,000 died in other camps, including concentration camps such as Dachau and Buchenwald. In deaths by country, Hilberg's list ranges from the 3m Jews of Poland to the fewer than 1,000 from Luxembourg, and in deaths by year charts the genocide's rise and fall. But the total is the same: 5.1m Jews. Other historians dispute Hilberg's arithmetic, arguing for 6m. Scholars remain divided on when and why the Nazis shifted from encouraging Jewish emigration (which saved half of Germany's Jews) to extermination (which murdered 90% of Greece's Jews). They argue about the role of the camps in the German economy. Irving used these disagreements to get into the debate. But his arguments were of a different order. He filed for libel in September 1996; that spring, his US publishers, St Martin's Press, had cancelled the publication of his Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich. Given his history, controversy was to be expected, even courted. Publishers Weekly pronounced the book \"repellent\"; Jewish organisations expressed outrage; Deborah Lipstadt was quoted as saying that St Martin's would hardly sign up a white supremacist for a book on race relations. St Martin's at first stood firm, but between a March Daily News report about the uproar and Frank Rich's April New York Times column calling Irving \"Hitler's Spin Artist,\" it lost nerve and cancelled publication. The principal effect of this, as Christopher Hitchens pointed out in Vanity Fair, was to transform a man with \"depraved ideas\" about the Holocaust into a poster boy for free speech. This lent the book the cachet of suppressed literature. and gave rise to Gordon Craig's declaration, in a review in the New York Review of Books, that \"silencing Mr Irving would be a high price to pay for freedom from the annoyance that he causes us\". Craig continued: \"He knows more about National Socialism than most professional scholars in his field, and students of the years 1933-1945 owe more than they are always willing to admit\" to his research. \"Such people have an indispensable part in the historical enterprise, and we dare not disregard their views.\" On Tuesday, Mr Justice Gray found otherwise. The argument is familiar. In the late 70s, French intellectuals were convulsed over l'affaire Faurisson. Robert Faurisson, professor of literature at the University of Lyons, wrote in Le Monde the \"good news\" that the gas chambers had not existed. \"The alleged Hitlerian gas chambers,\" he said, \"and the so-called genocide of the Jews form a single historical lie whose principal beneficiaries are the State of Israel and international Zionism.\" Hitchens described Irving as \"not just a Fascist historian, but a great historian of Fascism\". He also assumed that what Irving really wanted was a debate with his critics. If that had been Irving's objective, all he had to do was bide his time. \"Someone,\" Hitchens asserted, \"will no doubt pick up where St Martin's left off.\" Instead, Irving blamed Lipstadt for his troubles in the US and sued her and her publisher, Penguin Books, for libel in England. At which point it became more difficult to defend the proposition that what was at stake was Irving's freedom of speech. Faurisson's chief antagonist, French classicist Pierre Vidal-Naquet, argued : \"To live with Faurisson? Any other attitude would imply that we were imposing historical truth as legal truth, which is a dangerous attitude.\" Vidal-Naquet opposed his government's use of torture in Algeria and supports the rights of Palestinians. Perhaps because both his parents were deported by the Nazis (his mother died in Auschwitz), he felt it just as important to expose Faurisson's distortions as to support his right to distort. His scepticism about the role of the state has no echo in Lipstadt, unlike his argument against debating the Holocaust. He wrote: \"Confronting an actual Eichmann, one had to resort to armed struggle and, if need be, to ruse. Confronting a paper Eichmann, one should respond with paper... In so doing, we are not placing ourselves on the same ground as our enemy. We do not debate him; we demonstrate the mechanisms of his lies and falsifications, which may be methodologically useful for the younger generations.\" We need only set this passage from Assassins of Memory, his restrained, yet devastating, response to Faurisson, beside a similar passage from Denying the Holocaust to see the extent of Lipstadt's indebtedness. \"Not ignoring the deniers does not mean engaging them in debate; it means not doing that. We cannot debate them for two reasons, one strategic and the other tactical... The deniers long to be considered the \"other\" side. Engaging them in discussion makes them exactly that. . They are contemptuous of the very tools that shape any honest debate: truth and reason. Debating with them would be like trying to nail a glob of jelly to the wall.\" Though she relies on his arguments, Lipstadt is no Vidal-Naquet. She lacks his intellectual breadth, clarity of thought and expression, and, sadly, his stature as a Jew who has never confined his political engagement to Jewish causes. In Israel, as you might expect in a country where in the 40s the slang for Holocaust survivor translated as soap, the battle over representing the Nazi genocide has always been bare-knuckled and open. The arguments go back to the war, when supporters of mainstream Zionism sought to discredit the Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People of Europe (agitating noisily for rescue) as a vehicle of the right-wing Zionist terrorist group Irgun. As indeed it was. David Ben-Gurion and other Zionist leaders were not thought lessly \"writing off\" European Jewry, Peter Novick says, but just making a \"chilling... appraisal of what was and was not possible\". Though it is impolite to mention it, there are still live questions about the Holocaust. The dispute between intentionalists, who say that genocide was always part of Hitler's plan, and functionalists, who argue the Final Solution evolved in response to changing conditions and fortunes of war, is far from settled. Another open, though stifled, question is about the number of survivors. Irving's claim that Jews inflated the number of victims to extort money from Germany merely demonstrates his ignorance. The payments to Israel were for resettling refugees, and it would have been in Israel's interest to exaggerate the number of survivors, not the number of victims. But that doesn't mean there weren't individuals who, to qualify for payment, claimed to have spent the war hiding in Poland when they had been living, in relative safety if not comfort, deep in the Soviet Union. More delicate is the question of survivor testimony. According to Elie Wiesel: \"Any survivor has more to say than all the historians combined about what happened.\" Would Wiesel censure Lipstadt for saying: \"Lots of survivors who arrived at Auschwitz will tell you they were examined by [Dr Josef] Mengele. Then you ask them the date of their arrival, and you say, 'Mengele wasn't in Auschwitz at that point'.\" Would he censure her, or any historian, for daring to ask for evidence, documents, corroborating testimony? That is what historians do. And when they are prevented from doing it, either by Jewish groups who feel that the Holocaust belongs to them or by Zionists seeking to preserve Israel's \"moral capital\", the result is a blurring between memory and propaganda that serves only the interests of the Nazi perpetrators and their political legatees. Yet time and again those who insist on the truth in all its complex, unsentimental, paradoxical, and ambiguous detail are shouted down. It isn't only anti-Semites who, in T S Eliot's phrase, find a \"large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable\". The many obstacles thrown up by the history of our understanding of the Holocaust make Judge Gray's ruling all the more remarkable. But his reasoned arguments are unlikely to make an impact on either the Holocaust deniers or their opponents. Holocaust deniers, as the latest incarnation of a paranoid tradition, are by nature impervious to fact. For them, Irving's defeat confirms his martyrdom; the scale of his undoing proves the power of the forces against them. For the growing Holocaust industry, victory over Irving is more likely to be a stimulus than a restraint. In her statement after the trial, Lipstadt described the struggle against denial as unending. Let me be clear: Lipstadt deserved to win. But the encouragement that her victory will give to some groups supporting her - such as the Board of Deputies of British Jews or the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai Brith - in their efforts to police public discussion of the Holocaust and of Israeli policies, is no cause for celebration. Thanks to the efforts of her lawyers and their experts, we now know a great deal about what is wrong with Irving's scholarship. But the trial did not contribute to our understanding of the Holocaust.

Time and again, he referred to what an \"objective historian\" might do. But if judges aren't historians, historians shouldn't be expected to be judges. Irving's problem wasn't detachment but dishonesty. The Holocaust has always had a political as well as historical meaning; in America, that meaning has shifted a great deal from the days when conservatives saw a Communist behind every mention of the 6m. Perhaps with Irving safely consigned to the dustbin of history, the rest of us can join the debates that, in scholarly circles, have raged for some time. This may mean giving up comfortable certainties about the distinctness of Jewish suffering, the exterminationist nature of German anti-Semitism and the redemptive force of Zionism. But if the effect of the Irving decision is to strengthen the hand of those who wield the Holocaust like a totem, or a truncheon, then truth and history might as well never have had their day in court. \u0095 DD Guttenplan is currently writing an account of the trial for Granta Books, to be published next year.

      "bodyText": "Hopes that President Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe government was seeking a compromise proved premature yesterday when it appealed against a court order to evict thousands of black squatters on white-owned farms. Mr Mugabe's party, Zanu-PF, dispelled any lingering optimism by accusing the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, of treason. Its leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, who was in London yesterday, rejected the allegation but warned the British government to tone down its attacks on Mr Mugabe or risk turning him into a martyr. The mood yesterday contrasted with Thursday when the Zimbabwe government indicated that it was ready to try to encourage the squatters to leave the farms and Mr Mugabe named a delegation for land talks in London. But the attorney general, Patrick Chinamasa, has now said he will appeal to the supreme court against the high court ruling that the police should move the squatters. \"The police lack the resources to enforce the order,\" he said. The contradictory signals renewed the uncertainty. Although there were reports that squatters had left farms yesterday, the Commercial Farmers' Union, which represents white farmers, insisted that none had gone. More than 1,000 farms are affected by the invasions and 615 are currently being occupied, according to the union. The situation yesterday was described as generally quiet, although one white farmer's son was attacked with bricks. Mr Mugabe, attending a conference of developing countries in Havana yesterday, kept up his anti-British rhetoric and insisted that the \"acquisition\" of land would continue. In a worrying development, his government accused the MDC of forming an alliance with the United States, Britain and two South African politicians to sabotage the country and undermine Mr Mugabe, a charge dismissed as \"fantasy\" by the Foreign Office. The accusation was aired by the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation on Thursday night and printed in full in the state-owned Herald newspaper yes terday. The minister of information, Chen Chimutengwende, said: \"MDC is both waging a war and preparing for an escalation of that war against the government of Zimbabwe and Zanu-PF. \"We no longer believe that the MDC is genuinely inter ested in parliamentary elections, because they are concentrating on violence and the preparation of a full-scale military war instead of concentrating on explaining their policies in order to win the minds of the people. \"This is a war they cannot win, nor can they win the forthcoming general elections.\" Parliamentary elections are due in Zimbabwe and must be held before August, but Mr Mugabe has not yet set a date. The MDC secretary general, Welshman Ncube, blamed Mr Mugabe's covert security agency for the treason charge. We have no doubt it was prepared by the Central Intelligence Organisation,\" he said. He warned that it might be used by Mr Mugabe to claim that the security of the country was threatened, declare a state of emergency, and arrest the MDC leadership. Mr Tsvangirai, who is visiting South Africa, Britain and the US in order to build up the credibility of his party, declared: \"There is no MDC-Anglo-American agreement.\" He also described the illegal take-over of land as \"racism in reverse\" and said that if Mr Mugabe had left government in 1995 he would have gone with his reputation intact, but \"the past five years have been a disaster\".

The entire 3,500-strong District of Columbia police department was mobilised in a show of force designed to prevent a repetition of the riots that erupted in Seattle during the World Trade Organisation conference in December. With a hard core of up to 10,000 demonstrators expected to try to storm the IMF headquarters in 19th Street, staff from the fund and the bank were yesterday told to dress down to avoid being targeted. Between 30,000 and 45,000 protesters thronged the streets of Seattle four months ago. The IMF has been sealed off for a week amid the tightest se curity in the 56-year history of the two international organisations. But sources at the bank said they feared the protesters would try to fence off the building using \"sleeping dragons\", lengths of pipe and wire that are used to link people together and prevent police from removing them. The protests have been organised by a group known as A16 - named for April 16, the day the IMF's key committee is to meet - with campaigners using the internet to coordinate their activities. Although the US capital has been peaceful all week, seven people were arrested on Thursday and charged with conspiracy to commit a crime after police found pipes, wire, duct tape, gas masks, bolt cutters and heavy chains in the back of a truck. Police said yesterday they expected most of the demonstrators to attend a peaceful rally tomorrow in the Ellipse, an open space between the White House and the Wash ington monument. But they were also ready for widespread civil disorder and preparing for the possibility of mass arrests. Local police are being backed up by an array of other law enforcement agencies, including the secret service, which has been conducting undercover operations to discover the activists' plans. Both the bank and the fund have been rattled by the vehemence of the protesters, who argue that the two institutions have railroaded through economic liberalisation policies to the detriment of the global environment and the world's poor.

These say that Russia will consider itself freed from its Start obligations if the US breaks the ABM treaty, or if Russia's national security is threatened by the growth of \"aggressive strategically armed nations\". Other get-out excuses include the US or Nato deciding to strengthen their forces in a way which threatens Russian security, the deployment of weapons which hamper the functioning of its early warning system, or an emergency which could spark an ecological threat. With the political success of the Start II vote behind him, British defence sources said yesterday, Mr Putin will concentrate on trying to negotiate a package in which he accepts some amendment to the ABM treaty, to allow the US to build a limited missile protective shield in return for an American commitment to Start III. Despite continuing public Russian opposition to any change in the ABM treaty, the sources were optimistic that a deal could be agreed. Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, said yesterday that his government would propose several alternatives to changing the ABM treaty in talks in the US at the end of the month. Moscow wants Star III to cut the number of each side's long-range nuclear warheads to 1,500 or less, to enable Russia to concentrate on a leaner, more modern force, based on the Topol-M missile. \"A few modern missiles, capable of breaking through a missile-defence system in a retaliatory strike, would be a much more effective deterrent,\" a centrist member of the Duma, Andrei Kokoshin, said yesterday. But the US does not want to go below a floor of 2,000 to 2,500 warheads, leaving it enough to target 2,000 strategic Russian sites. US and Russian officials will meet in Geneva next week to assess the prospects for launching talks on Start III, which was agreed in outline three years ago. Future arms talks will take place against the background of Washington making it clearer than ever that it has abandoned the cold war doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD) and the notion of minimum deterrence. The US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, described the Duma vote as \"a big step forward\", and in Brussels the Nato secretary general, Lord Robertson, said: \"If this is a sign of the ability and of the resolve of Mr. Putin and the Duma to work together, it is a good sign for all of us.\"",

The credibility of the RSPCA is widely accepted amongst the general public and it would be enormously helpful in a number of ways if this organisation were seen to reverse its policy and become in favour of hunting.\"</p> <p>It goes on: \"To this end, Richard Meade and his supporters have formed a separate organisation called the Countryside Animal Welfare Group. Hunt supporters in particular, and indeed all friends of hunting, are asked earnestly to consider becoming members of the RSPCA NOW.\"</p> <p>Mr Meade confirmed to the Guardian that he was organising a campaign. \"I'm a former member of the RSPCA council myself and I believe they have wrong views of hunting so I am getting as many members of hunts to join them so we can change the situation. I cannot comment on the court action being taken by the RSPCA.\"</p> <p>A RSPCA spokeswoman confirmed that the charity had taken the unusual step of going to court to get a ruling on who can join the organisation - which is governed by the 1932 RSPCA Act.</p> <p>The spokeswoman said: \"The RSPCA has started proceedings in the high court to seek guidance on the way in which membership applications are to be handled and to clarify the relevant position of the society's constitution.</p> <p>\"The RSPCA's council is concerned by the damage being done to the society as a result of CAWG's activities. Three hundred or so membership applications are being held in abeyance pending guidance from the high court.

      "bodyText": "The venerable animal charity, the RSPCA, is seeking a court ruling to prevent the organisation being taken over by pro-hunt supporters in a coup being organised by Richard Meade, the former international showjumper. The charity has suspended applications from more than 300 people until it can get the high court to decide the validity of a mass membership drive being organised by the Countryside Animal Welfare Group (CAWG) - a pro hunting organisation set up by Meade. The RSPCA has had strong views against hunting and shooting and huntsmen and women are being canvassed to join the RSPCA so they can overturn its stance while the government inquiry into the field sport set up by Jack Straw, the home secretary, deliberates on the issue. One letter obtained by the Guardian from Joe Cowen, the senior joint master of the Fernie Hunt, sent to supporters reads: \"A number of influential people closely connected to hunting and the Countryside Alliance, led by Richard Meade, consider that the current anti-hunting policy of the RSPCA could be reversed if only half the subscribers of each hunt joined the RSPCA and voted to ensure appropriate representation on the Council. \"If this were to take place it would be a very significant and highly effective victory for field sports. The credibility of the RSPCA is widely accepted amongst the general public and it would be enormously helpful in a number of ways if this organisation were seen to reverse its policy and become in favour of hunting.\" It goes on: \"To this end, Richard Meade and his supporters have formed a separate organisation called the Countryside Animal Welfare Group. Hunt supporters in particular, and indeed all friends of hunting, are asked earnestly to consider becoming members of the RSPCA NOW.\" Mr Meade confirmed to the Guardian that he was organising a campaign. \"I'm a former member of the RSPCA council myself and I believe they have wrong views of hunting so I am getting as many members of hunts to join them so we can change the situation. I cannot comment on the court action being taken by the RSPCA.\" A RSPCA spokeswoman confirmed that the charity had taken the unusual step of going to court to get a ruling on who can join the organisation - which is governed by the 1932 RSPCA Act. The spokeswoman said: \"The RSPCA has started proceedings in the high court to seek guidance on the way in which membership applications are to be handled and to clarify the relevant position of the society's constitution. \"The RSPCA's council is concerned by the damage being done to the society as a result of CAWG's activities. Three hundred or so membership applications are being held in abeyance pending guidance from the high court. It is hoped that an early hearing date can be obtained in order to resolve this matter.\" Useful links: RSPCA Countryside Alliance",

He said: \"It's a sledgehammer to crack a nut. There are simpler ways of making the system easier and more accessible and that don't discriminate against poorer members of the community.\" Barnardos, Shelter and Marie Curie, meanwhile, all joined Oxfam in not accepting the vouchers in their hundreds of high street charity shops. Chris Holmes, director of Shelter, said it had been particularly angered by a Home Office rule that retailers who took part were banned from giving change to asylum seekers who used the vouchers to shop. \"This has been a difficult decision but we do not believe it would be responsible for Shelter to have agreed to profit from the change that people seeking asylum need in order to provide for their families,\" said Mr Holmes. The protest against the voucher scheme, which replaced cash benefits for thousands of asylum seekers two weeks ago, has also been backed by Save the Children, which said retailers were being enticed to join the scheme by the prospect of profiting from the \"no change\" policy, yet the vouchers at \u00a336.54 a week for an adult were barely enough to live on. Oxfam, which launched the boycott campaign, said the policy not to give change discriminated against some of the most vulnerable people in Britain.",

Sometimes, I can't wait to get it home, and instead stop in the middle of the park and sit on a bench, breaking it open as though it was the best box of chocs in the world. </p> <p>Now, I'm not one of those sad sacks who needs to be told how to clothe myself by some colour-blind French flit; neither am I one of those frigid fashionistas who gets no nearer to an orgasm than the new Fran\u00e7ois Nars blusher of the same name. No, the reason for my excitement is Justine Picardie, a writer and features director at Vogue. </p> <p>Even in a magazine culture as creepy and kow-towing as ours, with journalism and PR locked into some sort of infernally Dante-esque three-legged race of servility, Picardie is something to write home about (smarmily). If, like me, you believe that Sucking Up is the greatest spectator sport known to man, you're in for a treat. This one has been honing her craft for some time, building from a solid ground of mere grovelling to a peak of such superlative slurping that I don't believe there's a man to match her now - not the rock press on Ian Dury, not Paolo Hewitt on Oasis, not me on Princess Diana. No one . With her recent piece on the actress Tilda Swinton - \"The camera clicks, then the lights come on and we all clap, feeling somehow blessed yet also faintly disturbed . . . her beautiful, heroic nose . . . something grandly virginal about her, a quasi-Queen Elizabeth I marooned in the 21st century . . . she looks rather like a Mitford heroine, tall, patrician, every inch the general's daughter that she is . . . everyone around us is gripped by Tilda, craning to look . . . she looks like a Botticelli angel, a happy one, who hasn't fallen into the devil's hands but has discovered heaven on earth . . . she has something of the unicorn about her; mythic, rare, unsullied by commerce\" - Picardie outdid herself, shooting into the suck-up stratosphere. She is the Gagarin of gush, the Icarus of Ickiness. </p> <p>I've never thought I had the Suck-Up Gene myself, but a friend recently pointed out to me that the less power a person has, the better my manners. Show me a menial worker, and I'm practically genuflecting. Some people write this off simply as inverted snobbery, but that's like calling goodness inverted evil - totally meaningless. Snobbery works only one way. I once read that Princess Lee Radziwill was meant to be a very irritating person to have dinner with, apparently, because of her habit of looking up into the waiter's or waitress's face whenever they set down or removed a plate and saying, \"Thank you so very much\", as though they'd just given her the most fantastic present. This had a real effect on me, and ever since I was a kid I've behaved that way. </p> <p>I've got no time for those prigs who declare, \"Of course, I'm happy to tip - but only if the service is up to it.\" With me, it's the other way around: the worse the service, the more embarrassed I feel for the server, and the more money I give them. Once, in a bistro in Bristol, an American girl kicked me hard in the shin (bruising it), knocked water over my silver Walkman (breaking it) and finished up by tipping soup into my Versace handbag (ruining it). Then she burst into tears, sat down and said her PMT was killing her. I ended up giving her a \u00a330 tip for a \u00a320 lunch. </p> <p>But when I feel that someone is higher up the pecking order than me, I have an irresistible impulse to provoke and defy them. Naturally - the Suck-Up Gene being well established in the arts and media - people find this odd to watch. A year ago, I went to Channel 4 to talk to the head of comedy about a sit-com I'd had an idea for. My producer, Laurence, said nervously just before we entered this man's office, \"You're not going to do anything silly, are you, Julie?\" </p> <p>\"Of course not!\" I said, genuinely amazed and hurt by his question. We went in, shook hands, sat down and then I leaned across the table and said, \"So, are you the person responsible for commissioning that awful piece of crap, Smack The Pony? God, it really stinks! What were you on when you signed up those three talentless bitches?\" To this day, I don't know where it came from, and I can see that it's probably professional suicide. But I'd rather be like that than be, like so many showbiz and media types, rude to waiters. </p> <p>Apart from its effects on our collective culture, sucking up to people is actually very bad for them, too. The first thing I ever remember reading by the Divine Picardie was a marathon SU session with one Geri Halliwell. Up till then, Geri had been everyone's favourite Spice Girl, obviously with more humour, intelligence and - especially - common sense in her left nipple than the other four had in their brains and bodies combined. And what happened soon after? Halliwell changed overnight from a brassy, ballsy, sorted strumpet into a sad, desperately searching schizoid, veering wildly between taking herself far too seriously as a Thinking Poisson (see that UN debacle) and exposing her body to millions of strangers like a madwoman, while expectorating product that featured a level of talent the better than which you could find in any karaoke bar. </p> <p>Each man kills the thing he loves, said Oscar Wilde, and went on to point out that one of the best ways to do this was with flattery. I can't help but think that inside every Sucker Upper twists a warped, envious nihilist, desperately jealous of others' talents. I hope so, because the alternative is just too grim. </p> <p> Thank you so much (she said sarcastically) to all those kind readers who wrote so promptly to tell me that, no, I was not the architect of \"my\" beautiful pun. (\"They married in Hastings and repented in Leicester.\") A couple of them told me that I had, in fact, \"stolen\" it from Shena Mackay's Dunedin. As Miss Mackay is my much-documented favourite writer, I suppose I can't really frown and say, \"Who? Never heard of her!\" The line about imitation being the sincerest form of flattery rings a trifle too resonantly here, I fear. </p> <p>More cheering were the half-dozen or so letters that claimed to have heard this joke handed down from the music-hall. To be an ordinary old copycat is ignoble; to have inherited through osmosis the wit and wisdom of the working-class blood royale down the centuries seems far more poetic and acceptable.

      "body": "<p>One of the secrets of success in life seems to be to appear different from what you really are. Take Helen Gurley Brown, whom I have just been reading about in an American magazine. When her first book, Sex And The Single Girl, came out in 1962, it caused a sensation by telling women that they didn't have to get married but that they should have sex and enjoy it with whomever they wanted. The book made her briefly a heroine of women such as Gloria Steinem, but Brown fell from favour with the feminists after she took over the struggling Cosmopolitan in 1965 and made it the US's best-selling women's magazine by seeming to promote the idea that women should live entirely for men. </p> <p>A typical Cosmo cover displayed a busty model and a lascivious cover line. In her best-seller of 1982, Having It All, Brown advised women: \"Never refuse to make love, even if you don't feel like it.\" And now, at the age of 78, she has published another book of memoirs, I'm Wild Again, in which she repeats her favourite aphorism: \"Sex is one of the three best things we have, and I don't know the other two.\" To her office wall is pinned the slogan, \"Good girls go to Heaven, bad girls go everywhere.\" </p> <p>Naturally, most people think of Brown as a bad girl, obsessed with sex and men, even in her old age. But I'm Wild Again, despite its racy title and its cover picture of her in a slinky red dress, belies this notion. According to David Plotz, writing in Slate magazine, \"This is the autobiography of a puritan. It chronicles how Brown exercises obsessively; doesn't drink, smoke or eat; has remained utterly faithful to her husband of 35 years; and lives for her job. The Cosmo girl's dirty little secret isn't sex. It's work.\" </p> <p>But Brown's success has depended, to a large extent, on her false image. Without being thought of as wild and free, she would probably never have got where she did. And one can understand feminists' problem with her: a woman's right to enjoy sex with anybody may have been part of the feminist creed, but how was a woman to achieve this happy state of affairs without going out of her way (as recommended by Brown) to make herself attractive to men, which is not what feminists were supposed to do. (The British government, by the way, seems to be taking the Brown view in its curious campaign to fatten up the nation's women.) </p> <p>The case of Helen Gurley Brown set me thinking about other successful people whose appearances are deceptive. Behind the nerdish, academic exterior of Bill Gates there lurks a ruthless businessman with monopolist urges, as an American court has found. And take Andreas Whittam Smith, founding editor of The Independent: would he have generated the necessary confidence to launch his bold capitalist enterprise without his air of episcopal gravitas? I am even tempted to speculate that my friend, Alan Rusbridger, the editor of the Guardian, may have been unwittingly assisted in his rise to the top by his reserved, rather scholarly demeanour. </p> <p>It is not really possible to generalise about what you have to look like to get on, since fashions change and are different for different professions.

For some reason, this year there was a superfluity of Irish-American republicans onstage with me. These people talk about Britain with a ferocity which almost nobody in the real Ireland has deployed for years. Any body with a title like, for example \"The Committee for Freedom and Justice in Ireland\" is likely to be, in translation, \"The Committee for Abusing the Brits while totally ignoring Republican terrorism and intransigence.\" </p> <p>Appearing alongside these people was fun, in an adrenalin-intensive kind of way, but also deeply depressing. As travelling propaganda snake-oil salesmen, they spread an awful lot of disinformation around America - on TV, radio, in newspapers and at public meetings. By comparison, official British spokesmen on TV tend to sound, in the local demotic, as if they had corncobs up their ass. </p> <p>Did you know, for instance, that until recently Catholics were forbidden the vote, thanks to the British? Or that Reuters news agency is controlled by the British government? More generally, I was surprised to learn that the Unionist party exists to do only the bidding of the British tyrants. Sorry - I thought it was Protestant irredentism which was one of our main problems. Ask why they imagine that Britain should want to hang on to a territory which costs us billions of pounds a year, many lives, and considerable international prestige, and they mutter darkly about hitherto undiscovered oil reserves, strategic considerations - must be the threat from the Icelandic navy sailing up the River Foyle - and the way our army \"treats the Six Counties as a boot camp, with live targets\". I kept trying to say that, among everything, I felt the British had made great misjudgments, but that we would almost all, with the exception of Daily Telegraph leader writers, love to get the hell out. They dismissed this wishy-washy view with contempt. </p> <p>\u0095 Most American newspaper columnists are dull or rightwing or both, so it's truly awful to learn that Molly Ivins, the funniest, sharpest and most humane of the lot, has breast cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy. Normally she'd be here at the conference, attracting huge audiences with her witty, persuasive and sassy talk, all delivered in a Texan accent which requires a sour cream, hot pepper and jack cheese dressing, plus sub-titles. </p> <p>So we've had to make do with her latest book, Shrub - The Short But Happy Political Life of George W Bush - who, according to the polls, has exactly a 50-50 chance of becoming the next president of the US. What Molly points out is that Bush, who is running the most expensively funded campaign in the history of the world, has probably never met a rich man or a big corporation he didn't like, and has absolutely no idea of how poor people - or even most ordinary Americans - actually live. One example: while Bush, as governor of Texas, was trying to reduce the number of poor children who had health insurance, he was simultaneously pushing through a $45m tax reduction for big oil companies. As they say here, do the math. When Al Gore was serving in Vietnam, at least as an army reporter, Bush was in the Texas Air National Guard, a cosy, bullet-free home from home for the children of privileged parents. </p> <p>The received wisdom among some British writers is that the the interminable American electoral system subjects a candidate to a searching scrutiny unmatched anywhere else in the world. So it does. But in November, Americans are still going to be stuck with a choice between Bush and Gore. </p> <p>\u0095 Wal-Mart, the vast American chain of superstores, is about to arrive in the UK with help from those great guys at Asda. At first sight, their amazingly low prices will seem a welcome relief from rip-off Britain. Not for long, I suspect. A new book published here - How Wal-Mart Is Destroying America, by Bill Quinn, warns us that the store is a virus which can destroy almost any town it attacks. Just as the supermarkets killed off grocers, bakers, butchers and fishmongers, so Wal-Mart can finish the job by ending what is left - small stationers, clothiers, hardware stores and every chemist who hasn't already been swallowed up by Boots and Superdrug. </p> <p>Wal-Mart's strategy is to open a store offering astounding bargains outside a town. As the independent competition disappears, the prices rise. And the income, which would previously have been spent on local goods and services, is despatched overnight to Wal-Mart HQ, further impoverishing the town and what's left of its core. </p> <p>This might not matter so much in the cities, already blighted by chainstores, but it could be devastating to small market towns, among our few remaining glories. Any town that welcomes Wal-Mart and Asda - which are geniuses at weaselling-out planning permission - may soon find they are left with shell communities, their town centres composed of a few old buildings interspersed with gifte shoppes and theme pubs - a handful of disconsolate tourists wandering alone as the population shops miles out of town. </p> <p> \u0095 On Sunday I went skiing for the first time ever. Or rather, I set off for a day's falling down. The resort, I visited, Eldora, is a small and unpretentious set-up. A mere \u00a322 bought me ski and boot hire, plus use of the lift and two hours beginner's instruction from a man called Tom who looked as if he'd just escaped from the set of Bonanza. At the end of the two hours, my four classmates, who included a couple of middle-aged men, were sailing merrily up the chair lifts to the higher slopes while I was still falling down. </p> <p>What amazed me, as it always has, is the sheer politeness of Americans. Every time I fell down someone swooshed by with a consoling word. \"Heck, everybody's like that the first time\" - no they're not, look at my co-beginners. \"Not your fault, the snow's no good today, we need a fresh fall.\" Get real, please. </p> <p>\u0095 Years ago, bored at a Liberal party conference full of talk about environmental disasters and the evils of multi-nationals, I invented the new horror of cocktail sticks, or, as at left, the satay stick. Victims would speak about how the roof of their mouth had been hideously savaged. Young activists would rush off to picket the heartless makers of cocktail sticks who were obsessed with shareholders' profits, and lawyers would grow fat winning compensation for people who, biting into a mini-wonton, had pierced their cheeks like landed trout. But of course America is always ahead of us. At a buffet here, the tables were decorated with large signs reading: \"Warning! Sandwiches contain toothpicks!\"</p>",

Seven out of 10 people don't have enough food, leading to more disease and other chronic health problems. Half the under-fives are underweight and nearly 500,000 die each year. In spite of this, Ethiopia cannot afford to spend sufficient money on health and education because it has a $10bn debt to service.</p> <p>Aid donors should agree a substantial package of increased long-term aid and debt relief for Ethiopia and Eritrea to help overcome years of poverty and conflict. In return, the two countries should make immediate peace and commit to use the money for poverty reduction. The economics of a \"peace package\" make as much good sense as the morality behind it. The money will be saved ten-fold if it helps break the poverty-famine cycle in the Horn of Africa. <br><b> David Bryer </b><br> Director, Oxfam</p> <p>\u0095 War is not a phenomenon that can be turned on and off like a tap. The causes of the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea are profound and rooted in the history of the region. Conflict also breeds suspicion and hatred that take generations to dispel - think of how easily aggressive nationalism can be roused here. We cannot expect of the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments a willingness to absolve what they see as their responsibility over territorial sovereignty that would not be shown by our own. In taking a naive view of the policies of, and scope for change open to the Ethiopian government, we perpetuate an oversimplified perception of African reality that underlies many racist stereotypes. <br><b> Roy Love </b><br>Sheffield</p> <p>\u0095 It is now well-documented that the famines of 1973 and 1984 were largely man-made, as the international community failed to address the main causes of the famine: the war in Eritrea and later on in Tigray. There was no famine in Ethiopia after the end of the war in 1991. In fact by 1997 Ethiopia was reported to be self-sufficient in food. What has happened in three short years to lead to such a calamity? Again it is war, but this time it is on a larger scale. At the moment over half a million armed soldiers are facing each other. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that the cost of maintaining these armies is several-folds more than the cost of feeding the victims of drought. <br><b> Dr Zerai Woldehiwet </b><br> University of Liverpool zerai@liverpool.ac.uk</p>",

In spite of this, Ethiopia cannot afford to spend sufficient money on health and education because it has a $10bn debt to service. Aid donors should agree a substantial package of increased long-term aid and debt relief for Ethiopia and Eritrea to help overcome years of poverty and conflict. In return, the two countries should make immediate peace and commit to use the money for poverty reduction. The economics of a \"peace package\" make as much good sense as the morality behind it. The money will be saved ten-fold if it helps break the poverty-famine cycle in the Horn of Africa. David Bryer Director, Oxfam \u0095 War is not a phenomenon that can be turned on and off like a tap. The causes of the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea are profound and rooted in the history of the region. Conflict also breeds suspicion and hatred that take generations to dispel - think of how easily aggressive nationalism can be roused here. We cannot expect of the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments a willingness to absolve what they see as their responsibility over territorial sovereignty that would not be shown by our own. In taking a naive view of the policies of, and scope for change open to the Ethiopian government, we perpetuate an oversimplified perception of African reality that underlies many racist stereotypes. Roy Love Sheffield \u0095 It is now well-documented that the famines of 1973 and 1984 were largely man-made, as the international community failed to address the main causes of the famine: the war in Eritrea and later on in Tigray. There was no famine in Ethiopia after the end of the war in 1991. In fact by 1997 Ethiopia was reported to be self-sufficient in food. What has happened in three short years to lead to such a calamity? Again it is war, but this time it is on a larger scale. At the moment over half a million armed soldiers are facing each other. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that the cost of maintaining these armies is several-folds more than the cost of feeding the victims of drought.

But being properly equipped is also important. Spending an extra bit of cash on trainers that fit properly can help prevent injuries, while there are numerous gadgets available that can help you go that extra mile.</p> <p>Despite the astronomical cost of fashion trainers, a good road-running shoe can be bought for between \u00a350 and \u00a370. Before rushing into a shop and choosing the pair with the snazziest colours, it is essential to determine whether you overpronate- whereby the foot rotates inwards and downwards as you run- or supinate, its opposite. Whatever your running style, most good sports shops will be able to suggest the correct footwear.</p> <p>A popular shoe for those who overpronate is the New Balance 853 (\u00a359.99) and a good trainer for beginners is the lightweight Hi-Tec Shadow (\u00a330). For marathon aficionados, Adidas has brought out a limited edition of its Equipment Gazelle at \u00a380. Only 2,000 pairs will be available this year and the design includes a marathon route map as well as the Flora London Marathon logo. The regular Gazelle sells for the same price.</p> <p>It is worth bearing in mind that as trainers are constantly being redesigned, older styles can be found substantially below the original price.</p> <p>But with even the best pair of trainers in the world, blisters can still occur. This is often due to poor quality socks. Many serious runners wear thin 1,000 Mile socks (\u00a35.99) which guarantee blister-free running due to a unique two-layer system. The outer layer is supposed to grip the shoe while the inner one holds the foot.</p> <p>Alternatively, there are thicker padded ones such as those made by Thorlo (\u00a39.99). If you do get blisters while on a race or miles from home when out training, emergency relief comes in the form of Compeed (\u00a33.99). This is a plaster that relieves the pressure on the blister as well as forming an anti-bacterial second skin.</p> <p>With more than 1m people in Britain jogging regularly, the signs are that the sport is becoming as popular as it was during the 80s. In particular, more women than ever are taking up jogging and - not surprisingly - manufacturers are now tailoring running clothes specifically for females.</p> <p>For wet or windy weather, runners wear lightweight jackets which keep out the elements while at the same time allowing perspiration to escape. Nike's Clima-FIT jacket (\u00a369.99) comes in female sizes which have a narrower cut than the men's so that they don't billow out while running. Meanwhile Ronhill Women's Tracksters (\u00a318.99) are good all purpose legwear.</p> <p>Instead of wearing an old cotton T-shirt that becomes cold and clammy when you begin to sweat, it is better to choose garments made from synthetic materials which draw moisture away from the body and dry quickly. Nike's Dri-FIT base level long sleeve top (\u00a329.99) comes in both male and female sizes. A Hind women's Capri shirt (\u00a332) is made from cotton feel lycra, while Mountain Hard Wear's Kinetic shirt (\u00a344.99) has a half zip and mesh panels to regulate your temperature while out on the road.</p> <p>It has been suggested that women are put off taking up jogging because of the fear of developing sagging breasts. For peace of mind this can be avoided by investing in a properly designed sports-bra which can not only provide support but also help prevent long-term damage. One, such as the Supplex, is claimed to stay in place even during the most vigorous exercise and it comes in both Action Sportbra and Super Sportbra (\u00a324.99) sizes.</p> <p>If you get bored just pounding the streets on your own, it may be worth investing in an electronic device that acts like a personal training partner. The Polar M-Series consists of a lightweight chest transmitter belt and a wristwatch receiver.</p> <p>The equipment monitors everything from your heart rate to calories burned as well as telling you when to increase or decrease intensity of training. Prices range from \u00a339.95 right up to more than \u00a3300 and there is also an interface (\u00a3125) which allows you to download information on to your PC.</p> <p>To ensure runners in the marathon don't suffer from dehydration, there are refreshment stations all along the route providing more than 700,000 bottles of water.</p> <p>While out training, though, it is necessary to carry your own supplies. A simple Runner Feed bottle which is gripped by the hand costs only \u00a32.99. Alternatively a bum bag such as one made by Asics (\u00a314.99) has a pocket for the water bottle as well as room for snacks and valuables.</p> <p>For longer distance runs and for those who want to drink while on the move, a hydration system such as the CamelBak (from \u00a329.95) is recommended. Here a bag of liquid is strapped to your back like a rucksack: to drink from it you bite a plastic tube and suck. For extra sustenance, isotonic high energy drinks are recommended and if you didn't get a place in tomorrow's race, you can console yourself by drinking the London Marathon's own Liquid Power drink (\u00a36.99).</p>",

The outer layer is supposed to grip the shoe while the inner one holds the foot. Alternatively, there are thicker padded ones such as those made by Thorlo (\u00a39.99). If you do get blisters while on a race or miles from home when out training, emergency relief comes in the form of Compeed (\u00a33.99). This is a plaster that relieves the pressure on the blister as well as forming an anti-bacterial second skin. With more than 1m people in Britain jogging regularly, the signs are that the sport is becoming as popular as it was during the 80s. In particular, more women than ever are taking up jogging and - not surprisingly - manufacturers are now tailoring running clothes specifically for females. For wet or windy weather, runners wear lightweight jackets which keep out the elements while at the same time allowing perspiration to escape. Nike's Clima-FIT jacket (\u00a369.99) comes in female sizes which have a narrower cut than the men's so that they don't billow out while running. Meanwhile Ronhill Women's Tracksters (\u00a318.99) are good all purpose legwear. Instead of wearing an old cotton T-shirt that becomes cold and clammy when you begin to sweat, it is better to choose garments made from synthetic materials which draw moisture away from the body and dry quickly. Nike's Dri-FIT base level long sleeve top (\u00a329.99) comes in both male and female sizes. A Hind women's Capri shirt (\u00a332) is made from cotton feel lycra, while Mountain Hard Wear's Kinetic shirt (\u00a344.99) has a half zip and mesh panels to regulate your temperature while out on the road. It has been suggested that women are put off taking up jogging because of the fear of developing sagging breasts. For peace of mind this can be avoided by investing in a properly designed sports-bra which can not only provide support but also help prevent long-term damage. One, such as the Supplex, is claimed to stay in place even during the most vigorous exercise and it comes in both Action Sportbra and Super Sportbra (\u00a324.99) sizes. If you get bored just pounding the streets on your own, it may be worth investing in an electronic device that acts like a personal training partner. The Polar M-Series consists of a lightweight chest transmitter belt and a wristwatch receiver. The equipment monitors everything from your heart rate to calories burned as well as telling you when to increase or decrease intensity of training. Prices range from \u00a339.95 right up to more than \u00a3300 and there is also an interface (\u00a3125) which allows you to download information on to your PC. To ensure runners in the marathon don't suffer from dehydration, there are refreshment stations all along the route providing more than 700,000 bottles of water. While out training, though, it is necessary to carry your own supplies. A simple Runner Feed bottle which is gripped by the hand costs only \u00a32.99. Alternatively a bum bag such as one made by Asics (\u00a314.99) has a pocket for the water bottle as well as room for snacks and valuables. For longer distance runs and for those who want to drink while on the move, a hydration system such as the CamelBak (from \u00a329.95) is recommended. Here a bag of liquid is strapped to your back like a rucksack: to drink from it you bite a plastic tube and suck. For extra sustenance, isotonic high energy drinks are recommended and if you didn't get a place in tomorrow's race, you can console yourself by drinking the London Marathon's own Liquid Power drink (\u00a36.99).",

They were perhaps less sensitive to noise than Mr Farley, and said they did not think there was a problem.</p> <p>It turned out that planes were stacked above the house at peak hours, making it unpleasant for Mr Farley to sit outside early in the morning or for pre-dinner drinks. However, there was no evidence that the noise level was such as to affect the value of the house.</p> <p>If there had been, Mr Farley would have been entitled to compensation. But he had been deprived only of his enjoyment of his property. The county court judge decided that Mr Farley should receive \u00a310,000 for this.</p> <p>To put the figure in context, this is as much as the courts would award someone who had lost their index finger in an accident. Mr Skinner's appeal was not on the basis that \u00a310,000 was excessive, but that nothing should be awarded.</p> <p>As a general rule, the courts will not order damages where the victim has merely suffered disappointment. This leads to results described by one judge in the court of appeal as \"unfortunate, surprising, and even, in the view of the general public, unjust, but not absurd\".</p> <p>Mr Farley defended the county court's award on the basis that his contract with the surveyor had been specifically designed to give him the pleasure of living in a noise-free house. He claimed there were analogies to actions brought by disappointed travellers, who can, as an exception to this general rule, recover damages from tour operators, when holidays are a serious flop.</p> <p>The court of appeal decided it could not apply those principles to cases involving surveyors. It was conscious of an unsuccessful claim brought in 1986 by Richard and Collette Strover of Kent. A surveyor had advised them the house they were considering buying was connected to the main drainage but it actually drained into a cesspool. They were so upset by this that they decided to sell the property. In fact they got substantially more for it than they had paid, so there was no financial loss.</p> <p>The judge, after hearing expert evidence, had decided \"somewhat against my own instincts\" that the cesspool could not have affected the value of the property. The Strovers' claim for damages, based partly on occasional smells from the cesspool, was rejected.</p> <p>The court of appeal in Mr Farley's case declined to treat the instructions to the surveyor as giving rise to a claim for disappointment. While the courts have, in recent years, become more willing to award damages in cases like these, to make such an order against a surveyor would have been extending the law too far.</p> <p>Therefore the county court's order for \u00a310,000 was overturned. Mr Farley wants to appeal to the House of Lords, though the costs of doing so will be far more than he can hope to recover.</p> <p>The effect of this decision will be to leave many home buyers who receive bad advice from a surveyor without any remedy. Many features of a property have little impact on its value, but may still be of utmost importance to buyers. Examples might be the type of soil in a garden, the depth of a swimming-pool, even the dimensions of a garage.</p> <p>Many such matters can be tested by buyers themselves, just as Mr Farley could have spoken to the Civil Aviation Authority. That may be safer than relying on surveyors.</p> <p>\u0095 Richard Colbey is a barrister</p>",

But he had been deprived only of his enjoyment of his property. The county court judge decided that Mr Farley should receive \u00a310,000 for this. To put the figure in context, this is as much as the courts would award someone who had lost their index finger in an accident. Mr Skinner's appeal was not on the basis that \u00a310,000 was excessive, but that nothing should be awarded. As a general rule, the courts will not order damages where the victim has merely suffered disappointment. This leads to results described by one judge in the court of appeal as \"unfortunate, surprising, and even, in the view of the general public, unjust, but not absurd\". Mr Farley defended the county court's award on the basis that his contract with the surveyor had been specifically designed to give him the pleasure of living in a noise-free house. He claimed there were analogies to actions brought by disappointed travellers, who can, as an exception to this general rule, recover damages from tour operators, when holidays are a serious flop. The court of appeal decided it could not apply those principles to cases involving surveyors. It was conscious of an unsuccessful claim brought in 1986 by Richard and Collette Strover of Kent. A surveyor had advised them the house they were considering buying was connected to the main drainage but it actually drained into a cesspool. They were so upset by this that they decided to sell the property. In fact they got substantially more for it than they had paid, so there was no financial loss. The judge, after hearing expert evidence, had decided \"somewhat against my own instincts\" that the cesspool could not have affected the value of the property. The Strovers' claim for damages, based partly on occasional smells from the cesspool, was rejected. The court of appeal in Mr Farley's case declined to treat the instructions to the surveyor as giving rise to a claim for disappointment. While the courts have, in recent years, become more willing to award damages in cases like these, to make such an order against a surveyor would have been extending the law too far. Therefore the county court's order for \u00a310,000 was overturned. Mr Farley wants to appeal to the House of Lords, though the costs of doing so will be far more than he can hope to recover. The effect of this decision will be to leave many home buyers who receive bad advice from a surveyor without any remedy. Many features of a property have little impact on its value, but may still be of utmost importance to buyers. Examples might be the type of soil in a garden, the depth of a swimming-pool, even the dimensions of a garage. Many such matters can be tested by buyers themselves, just as Mr Farley could have spoken to the Civil Aviation Authority. That may be safer than relying on surveyors. \u0095 Richard Colbey is a barrister",

One has only to look at the range of legal misjudgments to point out that, perhaps, this it not always the case. Her view that mediation is 'another excuse for the nasty to walk all over the nice' is misguided. Mediation, unlike traditional justice, allows the 'nasty' to experience first-hand the results of their actions, and increases perception of the harm they have done. Similarly mistaken was her description of the judgment of Solomon as the first mediation. It was not, otherwise the 'mothers' would have decided the outcome of the problem. In the same way, much so-called mediation that takes place internationally is not true to the process, breaking many of the principles of impartiality and agenda-free conflict resolution. Unfortunately, Burchill is not wise enough to distinguish between mediation and its use as a guise to administer state justice by another name. Tara Barker Mediation UK, Bristol So Julie's going online to give advice. I now know where to go when I want a Bloody Mary mix or to become a one-time lesbian. But what about those poor sods with real problems. What will they get? Probably a giant virtual hand that slaps them around the face and tells them to pull themselves together. Serves them right. Chris Orr Brighton In my earnest 20s, Julie Burchill annoyed me. In my neurotic 30s, she angered me. With the imminent advent of 40, she amuses me no end. By 50, I'll be a devotee.

Great writers know there is nothing else to do, and most lesser writers would probably be incapable of any other way of life, however sketchy their literary satisfactions and paltry their rewards. Whether novelists, historians or general-purpose hacks, we know our limitations, and usually find that these do not extend beyond the filling, one way or another, of the unwritten page. But there are exceptions. An engulfing aura of pointlessness is capable of sinking the author whose two-year labours produce sales of a couple of thousand copies. Might it not be better, for heaven's sake, to do something, to act, rather than spend more years in futile toil at the word-processor screen?</p> <p>The writer who wants to change the world could be particularly vulnerable to this temptation. But succumbing to it seems a kind of betrayal. One writes one's piece, perhaps one's several pieces, filled with sincere outrage and all the literary power one can muster - and then passes on to the next subject. The writer has to write. The reporter has merely to report. In journalism especially, the line between writing and acting should be guarded with professional severity. Crossing over, in the short term or the long, is an offence against the canons of the trade. The battlefield reporter doesn't stop to pick up corpses.</p> <p>Anyone Here Been Raped And Speak English? - the title of Edward Behr's memoir sums up the code of the disaster correspondent hurtling to meet his deadline. Dominique Lapierre spent plenty of time as such a writer. A senior reporter on Paris Match for 20 years, he covered the Algerian war and many other catastrophe zones on the front line. He has also been a staggeringly successful author. From the 60s, his mega-works of popular history, several written with his American confr\u00e8re, Larry Collins, piled the shop-shelves high for months and years. The two men developed a uniquely accessible line in documentary reporting, with a strong human interest. They were early practitioners of total research. Is Paris Burning?, their first effort, reconstructed the liberation of the city from the Germans, based on interviews with no fewer than 1,200 witnesses. They wrote the life of a Spanish matador, El Cordobes, and, among other things, a celebratory history of the military operations behind the foundation of the Jewish state - O Jerusalem.</p> <p>The subjects, it is apparent, were picked for their commercial possibilities, as well as thematic grandeur. The Paris book, without the apparatus of scholarship, was revelatory as well as humanly gripping, and eventually had sales of five million, which at the time was just about unprecedented for a work of non-fiction. It was a classic of reconstructive history, personal and graphic, before television developed the genre and seized it, however fitfully, for itself. What counted most, though, were the numbers. These were in a league that almost any other author would consider justification enough of his life. Lapierre is a writer with no reason to feel frustrated that his passions and concerns are not exposed to a substantial part of the reading universe. When he branched out on his own, he became an even bigger name for publishers to boast of. City Of Joy, a book built around the poor children of Calcutta, which later became a Roland Joffe film, has sold eight million copies worldwide.</p> <p>Lapierre's books are the work of a reporter, but they always had an intensely emotional undertow. He plunges into his subject with a degree of sympathy that is sometimes disorienting if one approaches the books expecting dispassionate narrative. Though public events are his subject matter, the human stories come out more strongly than the political and diplomatic complexities. Perhaps he always was a candidate for going over to the other side. His style of hot-blooded engagement was halfway to expressing the need he later felt: to be quite extravagantly much more than that distanced, all-seeing but nothing-doing creature, the professional writer.</p> <p>His start was orthodox enough. There was no conflict between the quest for evidence and any distracting compulsion to react to it as a human being. He was no different from any other reporter, and was very good at it. \"In Algeria,\" he told me recently, \"I did some very tough reporting on people dying. They were wounded and I did not pick them up. My first loyalty was to my paper, and my first problem if I had a camera was to do the photos and make sure they got back to my office.\" Did he feel nothing beyond that? \"My compassion for the victims may have been total,\" he now reflects, \"but I just had no time. I couldn't stop to pick up a child who was bleeding and bring it to hospital. I discovered on the battlefield that one cannot at the same time be Hemingway and Mother Teresa.\"</p> <p>Forty years ago, I guess the Mother Teresa aspect of things featured hardly at all. As for the laconic Hemingway, any comparison with Lapierre's voluble excitement seems somewhat inapt. But it's clear enough what the macho newsman's priorities were. The facts, lady, just give me the facts. Those were wars in which reporters, with rare exceptions such as James Cameron, felt no more need to carry a stretcher than they did to propagandise - even between the lines, let alone as openly as happened in Bosnia in the mid-90s - about the rights and wrongs of the conflict. By the time he was 50, however, Lapierre began to think he had had enough of that life. This wasn't a case of the kind of physical fatigue that might overtake a reporter who had been 30 years in the field, so much as a certain kind of inconvenient moral enlightenment that had come from writing certain kinds of book. \"I experienced, suddenly, remorses,\" Lapierre said, in an arresting departure from his fluent English. \"I had seen so many things, and done nothing about them. It was a great moment to make retribution for all the things I had left undone.\"</p> <p>The retribution he made - if that's the right word for someone whose books, while perhaps over-effusive, hardly deserved punishment - was more spectacular than any writer has ever, to my knowledge, performed. Dominique Lapierre's leap from writer into actor has so far involved him in the sacrifice from his own earnings of around five million dollars. The catalyst was direct and personal: a benign reversal, one might call it, of the biblical law that approves an eye for an eye. Lapierre decided to repay, hugely, the very sources of his own prosperity - the subjects who made his latest books pruriently fascinating, the victims out of whom he might have made another fortune. He couldn't escape the emotional logic that said writing did not suffice. He may not have saved a single child from dying in Algeria, but, in the 70s, the producer of best-sellers, which had by now acquired an almost routine inevitability, found the new gold-mine from which, as he thought of it, to make amends: India.</p> <p>The place caught him at the time when he already suspected he had to change, and was looking for a way to shift the focus. \"India lends itself particularly well to that kind of psychological process,\" Lapierre told me. \"It is a very touching, very warm country. Maybe if the same thing had happened in Germany, I would not have been as touched by the sufferings of the Germans as I was by the hard lot of some of those Indians I met during my research.\" Freedom At Midnight, an account of the run-up to Indian independence, led fast to City Of Joy, his Calcutta epic that has nothing but common humanity as its theme and finally excludes all trace of the reporter's conventionally sceptical mind-set. It scrutinises deeply - in a way, almost celebrates - the human consequences of Indian poverty. The writer's life was not the only one this book changed for ever. Giving the money, however, turned out to be only the start. Lapierre's journalistic instinct, rather than being discarded, was put to service in a different way. He began as a disgorger of his gains, but soon became a ferocious polemicist. Examining what he has done with his five million dollars, one finds roughly equal portions of pity and fury.</p> <p>Let the fury come later. Not long ago, I was in Calcutta and went to see some of the fruits of his pity. He has been giving half his royalties to projects around the Ganges delta for 20 years, and has collected through the publicity he can generate - virtually unheard in this country, but loud in France, Italy, Spain and the US - another $200,000 a year over the past five years. Topped up by his own giving, the projects take around half-a-million dollars a year. In the bottomless ocean of human need in West Bengal - one of the poorest, most densely populated, disease-ridden, flood-prone, weather-beaten places in the world - it seems a tiny contribution. But it certainly rates against, say, a leader in the Guardian about third world debt.</p> <p>He began with lepers. India has a quarter of the world's sufferers, and their children, mostly living in slums and filthy, secluded compounds, have little chance. Contrary to most people's impression, once leprosy is diagnosed, it is quite easily treated and cured. But finding the victims and hoisting them out of the filth is another matter. Lapierre kept seeing them while researching the Calcutta life of Mahatma Gandhi, the key character, of course, in Freedom At Midnight. Mother Teresa herself told him that if he had money to spare, they should be his target. It was the beginning of an odyssey that has taken him into alliance with characters that would fit as well into a Joseph Conrad fiction as the most florid reporter's notebook.</p> <p>On the edge of the city, an hour's honking, heaving perilous bus-ride from the centre, sits the Resurrection Home - Udayan - for children of the victims of leprosy. Its founder, major domo, podgy and eagle-eyed superior is a former British businessman by the name of James Stevens. Between them, these two benevolent western autocrats - one who now says he never calls England home, the other who makes sorties to India three times a year from his house in St Tropez, to watch over his social investments - have made quite an impact on leprosy.</p> <p>Stevens got to Calcutta in 1968, intending to stay for a couple of years. But he couldn't get the leprous children out of his head. When he met Lapierre, who was fresh from Mother Teresa, he told him Udayan was about to shut down because he'd run out of cash. The Frenchman and his wife were electrified. They were ready for the transformation. \"My wife took out of her bag the bundle of dollars we had brought with us,\" Lapierre recounts in his recent autobiography, A Thousand Suns. \"'This initial donation will enable you to pay off your debts.' I said, and before really thinking, I added: 'We will fight to see that you never have to close the Resurrection home.'\"</p> <p>It is now a paradise of calm, which has seen 6,000 boys pass through it, cleansed of leprosy and fitted up with a basic education. Married to an Indian, Stevens has left Bristol far behind, though he did become an Anglican priest somewhere along the way. Collecting me from the city centre, he sits up front in the bus, the patriarch of a six- acre spread, chanting hymns to himself, gesturing almost regally to the throngs who see him approaching.</p> <p>Udayan began with 11 boys, and now houses 300 at a time, along with a handful of girls. The atmosphere and buildings come straight from a modest English public school. There can't be a more orderly, obedient, pacific collection of children east or west of the playing-fields of Eton, all of them seemingly grateful for their temporary rescue from the compounds and roofless hovels of those who are literally untouchable.</p> <p>Indian officialdom isn't sure it likes this kind of independent enterprise. It seems, after all, very European, even while being wholly Indian. There's been talk of infiltrating some party overseers, and Stevens spends a fair bit of the day hooked to his mobile telephone, grappling with Bengali bureaucrats. But the facts are there, that nobody else made. Some of these boys, going back a few years, have become teachers and civil engineers. At Udayan now, they live in clean, well-lit pavilions, eat regular meals, have regular lessons - and sleep on 300 beds and mattresses that suddenly turned up one day at the dockside, a gift from the Australian cricket captain, Steve Waugh. The name of Dominique Lapierre is splashed lavishly around the property, which would collapse without his money. It seems, in the circumstances, a modest replacement for the ego-trip of writing.</p> <p>So are the Dominique Lapierre dispensary boats that ply the remoter tributaries of the Ganges delta. A day on one of these takes you back to the simplicities of medicine. The door marked Pathology, below decks, covers a room no more than six feet by six, in which the equipment consists of a single microscope. The room marked X-ray, on this particular boat, still awaited its apparatus. Here is a health service, carried from the little mainland port of Raidighi to places that may take three days to reach and do not even appear on the maps, yet contain thousands of people who otherwise would see no doctor and get no medicine.</p> <p>After the former British businessman, enter the former Naxalite terrorist, who has become another Lapierre prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Wohab is the leader of SHIS, the Southern Health Improvement Samity, who shows that writers aren't the only ones in need of some form of displacement activity. At one time, Wohab ran among killers, but in 1980, under the influence of a Swiss priest, he changed sides. \"He persuaded me to change from taking life to giving life,\" Wohab told me as we eased down a mercifully quiescent Ganges towards the village of Lakshmi Janardhanpur.</p> <p>\"I was from the extremist group of the Marxist-Leninist party,\" he said quite solemnly. His extraordinary health work he sees as a kind of socialism in action, Marxism with a human face. Wohab is still intensely political, fired up by the myriad injustices you can never get away from in West Bengal and least of all here in the Sunderbans, which have changed little from the description given by one of the early Victorian mapmakers who first came across them: \"a sort of drowned land, broken up by swamps, intersected by a thousand river channels and maritime backwaters\".</p> <p>An embryonic system of floating dispensaries was underway before Lapierre came along. But he has made it grow hugely, on the back of Wohab's zeal. This time the enemy is not leprosy, but tuberculosis. Arriving at the village, we climb the mud-bank into a throng of scores of women and children, for whom this day has been long awaited. The doctor sounds and probes, the nurse - Sabitri, whose pioneering work with these people was the beginning of SHIS, of which she is now president - dispenses, Wohab himself supplies his own confident inexpert diagnoses to women who may have walked five hours barefoot to get here. More than 150 people were queuing up. \"I lost so many friends from TB,\" Wohab told me. \"I declared a holy war against it.\"</p> <p>Not without some victories. These SHIS dispensaries and clinics now serve some 400 riverine villages, and 1,600 on the mainland - the largest non-governmental TB control project in India. In 1998-99, more than 40,000 people were treated for it, all the poorest of the poor. What Lapierre's money bought, as well as a couple more boats, was technology and power-supplies, especially for X-rays.</p> <p>\"I went myself to negotiate the purchase of radiology equipment from the Siemens representative in Calcutta,\" writes Lapierre. Its arrival in the remote countryside \"provoked the sort of stupor a UFO falling out of the sky might have occasioned\". But in 10 years, he reckons, TB disappeared from more than 1,000 villages, and 100,000 sick people were cured.</p> <p>All this is good work. Far better than you or I could do, or probably would do, even with five million to spare. It's not, however, the work of an idealist who is starry-eyed, or unfailingly nice. Alongside the pity, we have the fury, which includes a certain vanity, directed at what the author-amateur sees as the excesses of professional aid organisations by comparison with his own. He, indeed, has no organisation. That is his point. As well as giving, he has the donor's interest in ensuring that the money doesn't go astray. \"I find it an absolute scandal that so many welfare organisations spend so much money on running their activities,\" he said. \"My readers, our supporters, know that when they send us a hundred dollars, it is a hundred dollars which will go to Calcutta.\"</p> <p>I have no way of verifying that. A Canadian donor, with experience inspecting such projects all over the world, told me as we chugged back up the Ganges that this was nothing special. Indeed, the 600 workers employed - inefficiently, as he thought - by SHIS made it sound like an aid-recipient itself, perhaps a Lapierre-financed exercise in outdoor relief in a social context where one job is commonly reckoned to keep a dozen family members alive. Nothing wrong with that, said my Canadian friend, but why didn't they spend more money fitting out the boat with better equipment for, say, minor surgery?</p> <p>What nobody could dispute, though, is that this kind of individual effort stays close to the people. There are no layers of offices, stretching back from Calcutta through Delhi to Geneva. Nobody flies first-class, checking into the local Oberoi. \"When I read that Ted Turner gives a billion dollars to the United Nations for the poor of the world, I think it's fantastic,\" Lapierre said. \"But I could tell you down to the last dollar what's going to happen to this billion dollars. These big organisations are not equipped to determine the real needs of the people. They don't know what a Bengal farmer really needs. How could they? Unless you have lived as a Bengal farmer, slept in his house, gone through the monsoon with him?\"</p> <p>Here, by contrast, the donor-in-chief is the scourge of all suppliers. \"There's no other way than to be extraordinarily attentive,\" he said. \"That begins with the banks in Paris, reducing the commission when you transfer $100,000. Then getting the banks in India to get a decent rate of exchange. Then making sure the contractor who is building your school is really doing what he says in his estimate. One brick in India can be four rupees if it's a good brick, three-and-a-half rupees if one corner is cut, three rupees if two corners are cut, and only two rupees if it is broken in two. Which brick is he going to put in your school and charge you for?\"</p> <p>Equally, he has few illusions about his own people. \"You give an ambulance to a centre, you create a problem. Who is going to be the driver? Is he going to steal half the diesel fuel? Is he going to put air in the tyres? When you come next year, is the ambulance going to be running?\" As the ambitions expand, so do the problems. \"You still have to monitor these extraordinary people very closely. This Wohab is a fabulous person. But he is now asking me for a scanner. A scanner! Many French cities don't have a scanner, and we're in the middle of Bengal!\"</p> <p>To this kind of end, nonetheless, Lapierre is now planning to sell his house outside St Tropez, and provide still further for people who will be depending on him when the literary stream dries up. The action man is approaching 70, and A Thousand Suns sets down a life from which all cynicism has departed. The \"pornography of poverty\", a phrase sometimes used to classify works, usually TV films, that exploit the poor for little more than voyeuristic ends, cannot conceivably apply to a man with five million dollars in the virtual Bank of Recompense. He doesn't dismiss the ongoing value of the profession he used to follow. \"Reporters must tell the world about Rwanda, Kosovo, Chechnya, Venezuela,\" he said. \"It's their duty to make the world aware of those tragedies, to move opinions, to force political leaders to take action. For a battlefield reporter suddenly to drop his camera and become a nurse would be a beautiful individual gesture. But I think, ultimately, his photos would be more important than holding an IV bottle.\"</p> <p>He himself just moved on. He discovered that, by becoming an actor, he could change things. To him, it is just another way of dealing with reality. \"I still faced reality, like a reporter. But this time with the idea of changing that reality.\" Anchored defiantly in the world he left, one can't escape the trace of feeling humbled.</p> <p>\u0095 Dominique Lapierre's core charitable fund is: Action Aid for Lepers' Children of Calcutta, 26 Avenue Kleber, 75116 Paris, France.</p>",

The facts, lady, just give me the facts. Those were wars in which reporters, with rare exceptions such as James Cameron, felt no more need to carry a stretcher than they did to propagandise - even between the lines, let alone as openly as happened in Bosnia in the mid-90s - about the rights and wrongs of the conflict. By the time he was 50, however, Lapierre began to think he had had enough of that life. This wasn't a case of the kind of physical fatigue that might overtake a reporter who had been 30 years in the field, so much as a certain kind of inconvenient moral enlightenment that had come from writing certain kinds of book. \"I experienced, suddenly, remorses,\" Lapierre said, in an arresting departure from his fluent English. \"I had seen so many things, and done nothing about them. It was a great moment to make retribution for all the things I had left undone.\" The retribution he made - if that's the right word for someone whose books, while perhaps over-effusive, hardly deserved punishment - was more spectacular than any writer has ever, to my knowledge, performed. Dominique Lapierre's leap from writer into actor has so far involved him in the sacrifice from his own earnings of around five million dollars. The catalyst was direct and personal: a benign reversal, one might call it, of the biblical law that approves an eye for an eye. Lapierre decided to repay, hugely, the very sources of his own prosperity - the subjects who made his latest books pruriently fascinating, the victims out of whom he might have made another fortune. He couldn't escape the emotional logic that said writing did not suffice. He may not have saved a single child from dying in Algeria, but, in the 70s, the producer of best-sellers, which had by now acquired an almost routine inevitability, found the new gold-mine from which, as he thought of it, to make amends: India. The place caught him at the time when he already suspected he had to change, and was looking for a way to shift the focus. \"India lends itself particularly well to that kind of psychological process,\" Lapierre told me. \"It is a very touching, very warm country. Maybe if the same thing had happened in Germany, I would not have been as touched by the sufferings of the Germans as I was by the hard lot of some of those Indians I met during my research.\" Freedom At Midnight, an account of the run-up to Indian independence, led fast to City Of Joy, his Calcutta epic that has nothing but common humanity as its theme and finally excludes all trace of the reporter's conventionally sceptical mind-set. It scrutinises deeply - in a way, almost celebrates - the human consequences of Indian poverty. The writer's life was not the only one this book changed for ever. Giving the money, however, turned out to be only the start. Lapierre's journalistic instinct, rather than being discarded, was put to service in a different way. He began as a disgorger of his gains, but soon became a ferocious polemicist. Examining what he has done with his five million dollars, one finds roughly equal portions of pity and fury. Let the fury come later. Not long ago, I was in Calcutta and went to see some of the fruits of his pity. He has been giving half his royalties to projects around the Ganges delta for 20 years, and has collected through the publicity he can generate - virtually unheard in this country, but loud in France, Italy, Spain and the US - another $200,000 a year over the past five years. Topped up by his own giving, the projects take around half-a-million dollars a year. In the bottomless ocean of human need in West Bengal - one of the poorest, most densely populated, disease-ridden, flood-prone, weather-beaten places in the world - it seems a tiny contribution. But it certainly rates against, say, a leader in the Guardian about third world debt. He began with lepers. India has a quarter of the world's sufferers, and their children, mostly living in slums and filthy, secluded compounds, have little chance. Contrary to most people's impression, once leprosy is diagnosed, it is quite easily treated and cured. But finding the victims and hoisting them out of the filth is another matter. Lapierre kept seeing them while researching the Calcutta life of Mahatma Gandhi, the key character, of course, in Freedom At Midnight. Mother Teresa herself told him that if he had money to spare, they should be his target. It was the beginning of an odyssey that has taken him into alliance with characters that would fit as well into a Joseph Conrad fiction as the most florid reporter's notebook. On the edge of the city, an hour's honking, heaving perilous bus-ride from the centre, sits the Resurrection Home - Udayan - for children of the victims of leprosy. Its founder, major domo, podgy and eagle-eyed superior is a former British businessman by the name of James Stevens. Between them, these two benevolent western autocrats - one who now says he never calls England home, the other who makes sorties to India three times a year from his house in St Tropez, to watch over his social investments - have made quite an impact on leprosy. Stevens got to Calcutta in 1968, intending to stay for a couple of years. But he couldn't get the leprous children out of his head. When he met Lapierre, who was fresh from Mother Teresa, he told him Udayan was about to shut down because he'd run out of cash. The Frenchman and his wife were electrified. They were ready for the transformation. \"My wife took out of her bag the bundle of dollars we had brought with us,\" Lapierre recounts in his recent autobiography, A Thousand Suns. \"'This initial donation will enable you to pay off your debts.' I said, and before really thinking, I added: 'We will fight to see that you never have to close the Resurrection home.'\" It is now a paradise of calm, which has seen 6,000 boys pass through it, cleansed of leprosy and fitted up with a basic education. Married to an Indian, Stevens has left Bristol far behind, though he did become an Anglican priest somewhere along the way. Collecting me from the city centre, he sits up front in the bus, the patriarch of a six- acre spread, chanting hymns to himself, gesturing almost regally to the throngs who see him approaching. Udayan began with 11 boys, and now houses 300 at a time, along with a handful of girls. The atmosphere and buildings come straight from a modest English public school. There can't be a more orderly, obedient, pacific collection of children east or west of the playing-fields of Eton, all of them seemingly grateful for their temporary rescue from the compounds and roofless hovels of those who are literally untouchable. Indian officialdom isn't sure it likes this kind of independent enterprise. It seems, after all, very European, even while being wholly Indian. There's been talk of infiltrating some party overseers, and Stevens spends a fair bit of the day hooked to his mobile telephone, grappling with Bengali bureaucrats. But the facts are there, that nobody else made. Some of these boys, going back a few years, have become teachers and civil engineers. At Udayan now, they live in clean, well-lit pavilions, eat regular meals, have regular lessons - and sleep on 300 beds and mattresses that suddenly turned up one day at the dockside, a gift from the Australian cricket captain, Steve Waugh. The name of Dominique Lapierre is splashed lavishly around the property, which would collapse without his money. It seems, in the circumstances, a modest replacement for the ego-trip of writing. So are the Dominique Lapierre dispensary boats that ply the remoter tributaries of the Ganges delta. A day on one of these takes you back to the simplicities of medicine. The door marked Pathology, below decks, covers a room no more than six feet by six, in which the equipment consists of a single microscope. The room marked X-ray, on this particular boat, still awaited its apparatus. Here is a health service, carried from the little mainland port of Raidighi to places that may take three days to reach and do not even appear on the maps, yet contain thousands of people who otherwise would see no doctor and get no medicine. After the former British businessman, enter the former Naxalite terrorist, who has become another Lapierre prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Wohab is the leader of SHIS, the Southern Health Improvement Samity, who shows that writers aren't the only ones in need of some form of displacement activity. At one time, Wohab ran among killers, but in 1980, under the influence of a Swiss priest, he changed sides. \"He persuaded me to change from taking life to giving life,\" Wohab told me as we eased down a mercifully quiescent Ganges towards the village of Lakshmi Janardhanpur. \"I was from the extremist group of the Marxist-Leninist party,\" he said quite solemnly. His extraordinary health work he sees as a kind of socialism in action, Marxism with a human face. Wohab is still intensely political, fired up by the myriad injustices you can never get away from in West Bengal and least of all here in the Sunderbans, which have changed little from the description given by one of the early Victorian mapmakers who first came across them: \"a sort of drowned land, broken up by swamps, intersected by a thousand river channels and maritime backwaters\". An embryonic system of floating dispensaries was underway before Lapierre came along. But he has made it grow hugely, on the back of Wohab's zeal. This time the enemy is not leprosy, but tuberculosis. Arriving at the village, we climb the mud-bank into a throng of scores of women and children, for whom this day has been long awaited. The doctor sounds and probes, the nurse - Sabitri, whose pioneering work with these people was the beginning of SHIS, of which she is now president - dispenses, Wohab himself supplies his own confident inexpert diagnoses to women who may have walked five hours barefoot to get here. More than 150 people were queuing up. \"I lost so many friends from TB,\" Wohab told me. \"I declared a holy war against it.\" Not without some victories. These SHIS dispensaries and clinics now serve some 400 riverine villages, and 1,600 on the mainland - the largest non-governmental TB control project in India. In 1998-99, more than 40,000 people were treated for it, all the poorest of the poor. What Lapierre's money bought, as well as a couple more boats, was technology and power-supplies, especially for X-rays. \"I went myself to negotiate the purchase of radiology equipment from the Siemens representative in Calcutta,\" writes Lapierre. Its arrival in the remote countryside \"provoked the sort of stupor a UFO falling out of the sky might have occasioned\". But in 10 years, he reckons, TB disappeared from more than 1,000 villages, and 100,000 sick people were cured. All this is good work. Far better than you or I could do, or probably would do, even with five million to spare. It's not, however, the work of an idealist who is starry-eyed, or unfailingly nice. Alongside the pity, we have the fury, which includes a certain vanity, directed at what the author-amateur sees as the excesses of professional aid organisations by comparison with his own. He, indeed, has no organisation. That is his point. As well as giving, he has the donor's interest in ensuring that the money doesn't go astray. \"I find it an absolute scandal that so many welfare organisations spend so much money on running their activities,\" he said. \"My readers, our supporters, know that when they send us a hundred dollars, it is a hundred dollars which will go to Calcutta.\" I have no way of verifying that. A Canadian donor, with experience inspecting such projects all over the world, told me as we chugged back up the Ganges that this was nothing special. Indeed, the 600 workers employed - inefficiently, as he thought - by SHIS made it sound like an aid-recipient itself, perhaps a Lapierre-financed exercise in outdoor relief in a social context where one job is commonly reckoned to keep a dozen family members alive. Nothing wrong with that, said my Canadian friend, but why didn't they spend more money fitting out the boat with better equipment for, say, minor surgery? What nobody could dispute, though, is that this kind of individual effort stays close to the people. There are no layers of offices, stretching back from Calcutta through Delhi to Geneva. Nobody flies first-class, checking into the local Oberoi. \"When I read that Ted Turner gives a billion dollars to the United Nations for the poor of the world, I think it's fantastic,\" Lapierre said. \"But I could tell you down to the last dollar what's going to happen to this billion dollars. These big organisations are not equipped to determine the real needs of the people. They don't know what a Bengal farmer really needs. How could they? Unless you have lived as a Bengal farmer, slept in his house, gone through the monsoon with him?\" Here, by contrast, the donor-in-chief is the scourge of all suppliers. \"There's no other way than to be extraordinarily attentive,\" he said. \"That begins with the banks in Paris, reducing the commission when you transfer $100,000. Then getting the banks in India to get a decent rate of exchange. Then making sure the contractor who is building your school is really doing what he says in his estimate. One brick in India can be four rupees if it's a good brick, three-and-a-half rupees if one corner is cut, three rupees if two corners are cut, and only two rupees if it is broken in two. Which brick is he going to put in your school and charge you for?\" Equally, he has few illusions about his own people. \"You give an ambulance to a centre, you create a problem. Who is going to be the driver? Is he going to steal half the diesel fuel? Is he going to put air in the tyres? When you come next year, is the ambulance going to be running?\" As the ambitions expand, so do the problems. \"You still have to monitor these extraordinary people very closely. This Wohab is a fabulous person. But he is now asking me for a scanner. A scanner! Many French cities don't have a scanner, and we're in the middle of Bengal!\" To this kind of end, nonetheless, Lapierre is now planning to sell his house outside St Tropez, and provide still further for people who will be depending on him when the literary stream dries up. The action man is approaching 70, and A Thousand Suns sets down a life from which all cynicism has departed. The \"pornography of poverty\", a phrase sometimes used to classify works, usually TV films, that exploit the poor for little more than voyeuristic ends, cannot conceivably apply to a man with five million dollars in the virtual Bank of Recompense. He doesn't dismiss the ongoing value of the profession he used to follow. \"Reporters must tell the world about Rwanda, Kosovo, Chechnya, Venezuela,\" he said. \"It's their duty to make the world aware of those tragedies, to move opinions, to force political leaders to take action. For a battlefield reporter suddenly to drop his camera and become a nurse would be a beautiful individual gesture. But I think, ultimately, his photos would be more important than holding an IV bottle.\" He himself just moved on. He discovered that, by becoming an actor, he could change things. To him, it is just another way of dealing with reality. \"I still faced reality, like a reporter. But this time with the idea of changing that reality.\" Anchored defiantly in the world he left, one can't escape the trace of feeling humbled. \u0095 Dominique Lapierre's core charitable fund is: Action Aid for Lepers' Children of Calcutta, 26 Avenue Kleber, 75116 Paris, France.",

      "body": "<p>King &amp; Barnes of Horsham, West Sussex, a family-owned brewery with a history dating back almost 200 years, has launched a beer-at-home service as part of its campaign to remain independent and fight off an unwelcome takeover bid from Shepherd Neame of Kent.</p> <p>A phone call, fax or email to the brewery will now get you a tamper-safe box of six beers for the good-value price of \u00a310, plus \u00a33.95 carriage. All six bottle-fermented, which means they contain live yeast and will continue to improve with age, so you might as well order two boxes of the same beer and lay down six of them - though that's not to say the beers aren't ready to drink straight away.</p> <p>The choice varies - the box I received contained Worthington White Shield, which the Horsham brewery now produces under arrangement with Bass. Other beers in the range include Old Porter, a magnificent interpretation of the 19th-century beer style; a bottled version of the brewery's famous premium draught beer, Festive; Coppercast, a spicy ale made with rye as well as barley malt; Cornucopia, a powerful beer that is a blend of corn and malt; and a delicious pale beer, called Faygate Dragon, that is bursting with citrus fruit from the hops.</p> <p>The fact that White Shield is now brewed in Horsham has caused some raised eyebrows among beer connoisseurs. That's because, historically, it is a classic beer from Burton-on-Trent, a direct descendant of the India pale ales developed in the early 19th century to refresh ex-pats stationed in the colonies. But White Shield left Burton many years ago, sent by Bass first to a subsidiary brewery in Sheffield and then to Mitchells &amp; Butlers' vast Birmingham beer factory.</p> <p>Now, however, it's back in safe hands, and the singular character of Burton-brewed beers - the spring waters from the Trent Valley - can be replicated by adding such salts as gypsum and magnesium. In general, I'm not in favour of beers that have been moved away from their original homes, but Bass would have killed off White Shield as a low-volume irritant if King &amp; Barnes hadn't offered to take it on. Crucially, K&amp;B is using Bass's yeasts to ferment the ale: one strain for primary fermentation, a second one for bottle-conditioning.</p> <p>The Horsham brewery also brews its own bottle-fermented India ale, which is available as part of the take-home service, too. (The full K&amp;B range can be found on <a href=\"http://www.kingandbarnes.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.kingandbarnes.co.uk</a>; tel 01403 270470; fax 01403 225737; email info@kingandbarnes.co.uk.) Devotees of the IPA style can taste both beers side by side, and decide which they prefer.</p> <p>In the days BC (Before Caffreys), when Bass cared about its great ales, a brewer in Burton told me that Worthington White Shield came into drinkable condition about a month after bottling, was at its best after three months (the length of a sea journey from England to Calcutta in the 19th century) but then mysteriously went out of condition after nine months - this was known as the \"sickness period\"; then, after a year, it was drinkable again. I tasted some aged White Shield at Burton, and found it remarkably complex. The hops had softened, but there was a rich fruitiness reminiscent of citrus fruits and raisins. I have a dusty nine-year-old that I will crack open soon and compare with a fresh one.</p> <p>On another note, the trickle of organic beers has yet to become a flood, but the number is slowly increasing. It's especially encouraging when one of the big hitters among regional brewers joins the small band of chemical-free producers. Fuller's of west London, famous for its London Pride and ESB bitters, has brewed a pale Honey Dew beer for several years, mainly for the spring and summer. For the past year, however, it has been experimenting with organic materials in order to turn Honey Dew into a fully-fledged organic ale. The result - brewed from English organic barley malt and Target hops grown by Peter Hall at Marden in Kent, the only regular grower of chemical-free hops - was launched last month. As the name suggests, the beer's ingredients also include fresh honey, which imparts a pleasant and not overly sweet character to the aroma and flavour. The result is a complex ale with a rich aroma, a palate of juicy malt, honey and spicy hops, and a long, lingering, bitter-sweet finish. Honey Dew is 5% alcohol in bottle. A draught, cask-conditioned version at 4.3% will be available in Fuller's pubs and the free trade during the spring (for more information, call Fuller's on 020-8996 2000)</p>",

      "bodyText": "King &amp; Barnes of Horsham, West Sussex, a family-owned brewery with a history dating back almost 200 years, has launched a beer-at-home service as part of its campaign to remain independent and fight off an unwelcome takeover bid from Shepherd Neame of Kent. A phone call, fax or email to the brewery will now get you a tamper-safe box of six beers for the good-value price of \u00a310, plus \u00a33.95 carriage. All six bottle-fermented, which means they contain live yeast and will continue to improve with age, so you might as well order two boxes of the same beer and lay down six of them - though that's not to say the beers aren't ready to drink straight away. The choice varies - the box I received contained Worthington White Shield, which the Horsham brewery now produces under arrangement with Bass. Other beers in the range include Old Porter, a magnificent interpretation of the 19th-century beer style; a bottled version of the brewery's famous premium draught beer, Festive; Coppercast, a spicy ale made with rye as well as barley malt; Cornucopia, a powerful beer that is a blend of corn and malt; and a delicious pale beer, called Faygate Dragon, that is bursting with citrus fruit from the hops. The fact that White Shield is now brewed in Horsham has caused some raised eyebrows among beer connoisseurs. That's because, historically, it is a classic beer from Burton-on-Trent, a direct descendant of the India pale ales developed in the early 19th century to refresh ex-pats stationed in the colonies. But White Shield left Burton many years ago, sent by Bass first to a subsidiary brewery in Sheffield and then to Mitchells &amp; Butlers' vast Birmingham beer factory. Now, however, it's back in safe hands, and the singular character of Burton-brewed beers - the spring waters from the Trent Valley - can be replicated by adding such salts as gypsum and magnesium. In general, I'm not in favour of beers that have been moved away from their original homes, but Bass would have killed off White Shield as a low-volume irritant if King &amp; Barnes hadn't offered to take it on. Crucially, K&amp;B is using Bass's yeasts to ferment the ale: one strain for primary fermentation, a second one for bottle-conditioning. The Horsham brewery also brews its own bottle-fermented India ale, which is available as part of the take-home service, too. (The full K&amp;B range can be found on www.kingandbarnes.co.uk; tel 01403 270470; fax 01403 225737; email info@kingandbarnes.co.uk.) Devotees of the IPA style can taste both beers side by side, and decide which they prefer. In the days BC (Before Caffreys), when Bass cared about its great ales, a brewer in Burton told me that Worthington White Shield came into drinkable condition about a month after bottling, was at its best after three months (the length of a sea journey from England to Calcutta in the 19th century) but then mysteriously went out of condition after nine months - this was known as the \"sickness period\"; then, after a year, it was drinkable again. I tasted some aged White Shield at Burton, and found it remarkably complex. The hops had softened, but there was a rich fruitiness reminiscent of citrus fruits and raisins. I have a dusty nine-year-old that I will crack open soon and compare with a fresh one. On another note, the trickle of organic beers has yet to become a flood, but the number is slowly increasing. It's especially encouraging when one of the big hitters among regional brewers joins the small band of chemical-free producers. Fuller's of west London, famous for its London Pride and ESB bitters, has brewed a pale Honey Dew beer for several years, mainly for the spring and summer. For the past year, however, it has been experimenting with organic materials in order to turn Honey Dew into a fully-fledged organic ale. The result - brewed from English organic barley malt and Target hops grown by Peter Hall at Marden in Kent, the only regular grower of chemical-free hops - was launched last month. As the name suggests, the beer's ingredients also include fresh honey, which imparts a pleasant and not overly sweet character to the aroma and flavour. The result is a complex ale with a rich aroma, a palate of juicy malt, honey and spicy hops, and a long, lingering, bitter-sweet finish. Honey Dew is 5% alcohol in bottle. A draught, cask-conditioned version at 4.3% will be available in Fuller's pubs and the free trade during the spring (for more information, call Fuller's on 020-8996 2000)",

Well, I had that feeling as we crossed the threshold of the Star. In fact, I had it as soon as I clapped eyes on the Star, sitting prettily off a back road on the edge of the village of Harome. It just looked nice: properly nice, pleasant, sensible. It has that traditional crepuscular lighting, too, that no amount of art can achieve. It had real beams, real fires, real beer and real food. It had fine wines, judiciously priced. It had delightful, intelligent service. And it had those qualities that are rarer than rubies and more valuable than frankincense: warmth, both genuine and deep, consideration, and an innate feeling for what you, or at least I, want.</p> <p>What I wanted more than anything was to draw up a chair by the fire, sit down and meditate on the menu over a pint of Black Sheep. So that is what I did, while all around people went on grazing through their lunches. You can eat in a thoroughly comfortable and well-appointed, half-timbered dining room, which is fine for high days and holidays, but which for my money could not match the winning charm of the bar and the fire. It also allowed me to scrutinise the dishes as they were brought in, so that I could better make up my mind, among the first courses, between terrine of gammon with fried quail's egg; risotto of chanterelles, red chard and Twineham Grange Parmesan; and smoked salmon with grilled scallops and cucumber relish (relishes, chutneys and dressings are something of a feature on this menu). And, for the mains, between braised lamb shank with pearl barley \"risotto\" (their inverted commas) and root vegetables; fricass\u00e9e of chicken with oyster mushrooms and baby spinach; and braised faggots with oxtail hash, red onion marmalade and ale juices.</p> <p>Although mightily tempted, I did not opt for the faggots. No, I decided on the dishes of the day: calves' liver with spring greens, preceded by a terrine of herring and potato, and caper mayonnaise. The General settled down to a few slices of home-cured beef and salad of ox tongue, pickled red onion and horseradish dressing, following up with duck sausages, creamed cabbage mash and baked beans. Not any old baked beans, as he pointed out, but, like everything else, made in-house. Okay, so this is all on the bold and hearty side, but I like bold and hearty. You know where you are with it. And there's no wondering which menu this kind of food has been cloned from. There are a few modish Mediterranean dishes and touches, but for the most part native ingredients are used with native wit and intelligence to make suitably updated native dishes in an identifiably English tradition. On top of all that, it was jolly good.</p> <p>The potato in the terrine was just cooked through, enough to define a different texture from that of the sweet herring. There was dill in evidence, and a rich bite from the caper mayo. It was all very fresh-tasting, light and morally uplifting. The General's beef and tongue was a smart representation of traditional elements - the grainy-textured beef showing off the benefits of a sprightly cure, the smooth density of the tongue sitting happily with the leafy freshness of the salad.</p> <p>My liver showed a similar benefit from care and thought. There were two thick slices, whose thickness means you get a sequence of textures, from the crisp outside to the melting tenderness of the middle. The red-wine sauce with which they came was almost too forceful in its attentions, but the greens had a sparkling brilliance and were squeaky with spring. The General raised an eyebrow at the scale model of the Matterhorn made of mash and sausages that appeared before him, muttered something about \"Yorkshire portions\", and then set to with a will, and levelled the plate. He allowed me a portion of sausage along the way. It was sweet-flavoured and equal to the finest conventional banger, marrying particularly well with the potato and cabbage mash. It wasn't a dish for the nibbler or those under doctor's orders, but it had splendid vigour.</p> <p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the General decided to call it a day at this point.

Yet, for them, there is a psychological distance between the two that represents a complete escape from dry land. They might as well have left the mainland for an island.</p> <p>Until a year ago, the Walls lived in a big, cluttered Victorian townhouse barely a mile from the city docks. A series of mid-life crises prompted them to subject their old lives to a process of \"drastic surgery\". They sold everything - absolutely everything - bought Isobel, a half-converted industrial barge, and transformed her into a modernist dream boat. \"We made a huge leap in a new direction,\" says Rick. \"It was a very scary thing to do.\" I found it scary enough just crossing that 3ft gap: getting on to the Isobel is a case of clattering down a gangway that, in keeping with the rest of the boat, has been reinvented as a zig-zag of aluminium steps.</p> <p>There are, however, even more frightening ways of getting on to boats. Visit the Walls' stern-end neighbours, Richard Rankin and Theresa Blosse, and you have to reverse down a ladder, navigate a path across the roof of their cabin (past a smoking chimney and a television aerial), and clamber into their narrowboat quarters - backwards.</p> <p>There are more conventional ways, too. The front door of Vicky Cairns's Heloise Bay (at the bow end of the Isobel) is reached by a robust set of wooden steps with a proper handrail. She's even got a door-knocker and a cat-flap; though there is nothing conventional about the hand-painted scenes of riverside wildlife that provide a backdrop to Cairns's small, on-deck garden.</p> <p>In wild, windy weather, the steps are prone to swing from side to side with the slight, but perceptible, movement of the boat. And what a surprise, when you step below-deck, to find a huge - indeed vast - open-plan space stuffed with, well, stuff; the kind of stuff that you really don't expect to find on boats: standard lamps, portraits of Edwardian grandmothers and an upright piano.</p> <p>This rich diversity of lifestyle - the different means to the same end - is one of the things that attracted the Walls to join Bristol's dockland community of \"boat people\". There are dozens of them spread out around the city's floating harbour. Clinging to wharf walls between bridges, below modern office blocks and converted Victorian warehouses, they include water-borne homes of every description, from canal boats and converted barges to ordinary motor cruisers that you wouldn't know were homes, were it not for the net curtains.</p> <p>Rankin and Blosse are, perhaps, the stereotypical boat people. For them, there is almost no life beyond the water. Rankin builds boats and operates a private pleasure cruiser; Theresa runs the \"Friends of the Swans\", the volunteers who feed the 200 or so birds that glide around the docks. She also looks after their five-month-old son, Noah. And though the couple are far from conventional, their home, Excalibur, is what you'd expect of boat life. A traditional narrowboat, it's barely wider than a double bed - the route from one end to the other is an assault course of armchairs, baby buggies and dog baskets.</p> <p>There are compensations, says Richard. Unlike her bigger neighbours, Excalibur is fully mobile. You can take her on a spin around the docks and back again. You can even travel down the Kennet and Avon Canal to Bath. \"It only takes a week.\"</p> <p>The Isobel used to move, too, but that was more than 100 years ago, when it ran between Bristol and Bath carrying cargoes of tar. Now, it's going nowhere: Rick and Sue Wall removed the engine to make more space - masses of light, open space. Again, it's not what you expect of a boat home but, more frequently, it is what you get. Broad-beamed industrial river barges, both English and Dutch, have become the floating equivalents of the New York-style loft. In the Walls' case, even the process of conversion has direct parallels.</p> <p>The Isobel had been lived in before, but it was little more than a shell when they first saw her. \"The ceiling was barely higher than I am,\" says Sue. \"It was very dark inside, with windows across the top but none at water level.\" They employed an architect and a boat builder (neither had worked with anyone in the other's profession before), and drew up a brief that, says Sue, \"threw out the rule book on boat decor\".</p> <p>The initial response was along the lines of \"It's not very classical, is it? Where's the tongue-and-groove?\" But the Walls persisted, and their happy alliance with both architect and builder produced the nearest Bristol gets to a Modern movement house boat. The exterior, for example, is clad in copper and features a long, canopied deck bordered by shrubbery arranged in lines of aluminium planters. Inside, it's all white paint, raw plaster, pale-wood floors, black leather and stainless steel.</p> <p>Taking the minimalist route was not about following the diktats of fashion, insists Rick: \"It was about saying that one part of our life is over, so what's next?\" The couple had lived in the same house for 20 years, raised three children, worked in high-pressure jobs; they wanted the boat to encapsulate the risks they'd taken in leaving all that behind. \"To us, minimalism is about having no more than one plant to water,\" explains Sue, adding that the flower arrangements are realistic fakes. \"We wanted a simple, low-maintenance life. Friends who knew us in our old house, say things like, 'Where do you put your nick-nacks?' We don't put them anywhere. We don't have them anymore.\" What they do have is \"a nice balance between living right in the inner city, but having something natural going on outside\".</p> <p>According to Rick and Sue, there's a big difference between \"just looking at the water and actually feeling part of it\". In their book, you don't get to be part of it just by buying a flat with a watery view.

But, in other respects, it's not much different from living in a house, she says. \"It costs less than a house - certainly less than a city-centre house.\" In fact, a quick comparison with harbour-side flats suggests we are probably looking at twice the space for roughly two-thirds of the money.

Yet, for them, there is a psychological distance between the two that represents a complete escape from dry land. They might as well have left the mainland for an island. Until a year ago, the Walls lived in a big, cluttered Victorian townhouse barely a mile from the city docks. A series of mid-life crises prompted them to subject their old lives to a process of \"drastic surgery\". They sold everything - absolutely everything - bought Isobel, a half-converted industrial barge, and transformed her into a modernist dream boat. \"We made a huge leap in a new direction,\" says Rick. \"It was a very scary thing to do.\" I found it scary enough just crossing that 3ft gap: getting on to the Isobel is a case of clattering down a gangway that, in keeping with the rest of the boat, has been reinvented as a zig-zag of aluminium steps. There are, however, even more frightening ways of getting on to boats. Visit the Walls' stern-end neighbours, Richard Rankin and Theresa Blosse, and you have to reverse down a ladder, navigate a path across the roof of their cabin (past a smoking chimney and a television aerial), and clamber into their narrowboat quarters - backwards.

One theory I have heard to explain this is that the Dutch have done so much work on tulips that the RHS felt themselves upstaged and therefore looked the other way.</p> <p>And yet tulips have far greater scope for development and variation than narcissi. I would add that they have far more personality. Narcissi are po-faced, always looking in the same direction, always predictable, never changing in response to sunshine or cloud, to warmth or to cold. This makes them reliable exhibition material; you know where you are with them. Whereas tulips are wayward and fool - or dazzle - you with all kinds of antics. Like the characters in a Dostoevsky novel, you never know quite where you stand with them.</p> <p>I am growing more than ever this year. There are always places to be found for them if you look, though you may not be ready to plant them straight away. It was after Christmas before we had planted our last, but tulips are very forgiving.</p> <p>There are two ways of growing them as garden plants (we also grow them in containers, of course): either as spring bedding, in which case the bulbs will need to be lifted to make way for a summer sequence, or as permanencies among perennials or near to deciduous shrubs.</p> <p>If your tulips need to be lifted while still in full growth, don't replant them, hoping they won't have noticed the disturbance. You can't fool a tulip. Knock most of the soil off their roots and lay them on racks in a cool, airy shed. There they will withdraw nutrients back from stems and leaves into the bulbs. When sere, finish the job; pull out the withered stems, rub off any remaining soil from the bulbs and store them somewhere mouse-proof for the summer. We hang them in net bags (labelled) from a horizontal pole between two cross-beams. Squirrels would not be foiled, but mice are. At some stage (in that wet weather that never seems to materialise), we sort through our bulbs, separating those that are (or look) large enough to be used again for bedding next year from those that don't. We don't throw these away, but line them out to grow on and be used again for bedding the year after.</p> <p>If you retain old bulbs, you give them the chance of \"breaking\" and of making for you those remarkable stripy tulips that feature in all the old Dutch flower paintings and were so highly regarded at that time, but which it has become illegal to sell, because we now know that \"breaking\" is caused by virus infection. Like eating of the tree of knowledge, we can no longer live in happy ignorance. The viruses are still there and can never be eliminated, but we now go through the motions of shutting the stable door and pretending that the horse hasn't bolted, while knowing full well that it has.</p> <p>So, if we want broken tulips (and who wouldn't?), we must let them occur on retained stock in our own gardens - which will quickly happen sooner rather than later, (the viruses are spread by aphids, which are ever with us) although always with unpredictable results. I haven't the space to go further into the subject here but you should certainly read Anna Pavord's fascinating monograph, The Tulip (published by Bloomsbury), for the full story. She writes with restrained passion and with a great deal of research behind her.</p> <p>The second way of growing tulips, as border permanencies, is full of possibilities, as you discover more ways in which to use them. I grow a lot of border phloxes ( Phlox paniculata and its cultivars); my heavy soil suits them. They need replanting every three or four years, but this gives me the opportunity of running tulips between their clumps and thereby pepping up an area in spring that would otherwise be rather dull. We did this with a late-flowering orange (flushed pink) tulip called 'Dillenburg', which is now coming up for its third season. And where there was initially one bulb, there are now clumps of several. Any gardener will appreciate how satisfying, not to say flattering, this is. The tulips really like us; hurrah!</p> <p>But how shall we act when we really must rejuvenate our phlox plantings? That cannot for much longer be delayed. We can do it in the autumn, but cannot contemplate pulling the border to pieces until November, as we pride ourselves on our lively October garden. By November, the tulips will already be making strong new roots and the check would be serious. The answer is that we shall lift them during the summer, while their tops are still visible but they are fully dormant; then store them until we are ready to plant in November. Stored dry, they will remain dormant.</p> <p>In other parts of the border, the tulips never need disturbing, as they are among perennials that detest disturbance. For instance, we have had the Darwin Hybrid 'Red Matador' with Eryngium x oliverianum for 30 years, and the tulip clumps are enormous</p>",

We hang them in net bags (labelled) from a horizontal pole between two cross-beams. Squirrels would not be foiled, but mice are. At some stage (in that wet weather that never seems to materialise), we sort through our bulbs, separating those that are (or look) large enough to be used again for bedding next year from those that don't. We don't throw these away, but line them out to grow on and be used again for bedding the year after. If you retain old bulbs, you give them the chance of \"breaking\" and of making for you those remarkable stripy tulips that feature in all the old Dutch flower paintings and were so highly regarded at that time, but which it has become illegal to sell, because we now know that \"breaking\" is caused by virus infection. Like eating of the tree of knowledge, we can no longer live in happy ignorance. The viruses are still there and can never be eliminated, but we now go through the motions of shutting the stable door and pretending that the horse hasn't bolted, while knowing full well that it has. So, if we want broken tulips (and who wouldn't?), we must let them occur on retained stock in our own gardens - which will quickly happen sooner rather than later, (the viruses are spread by aphids, which are ever with us) although always with unpredictable results. I haven't the space to go further into the subject here but you should certainly read Anna Pavord's fascinating monograph, The Tulip (published by Bloomsbury), for the full story. She writes with restrained passion and with a great deal of research behind her. The second way of growing tulips, as border permanencies, is full of possibilities, as you discover more ways in which to use them. I grow a lot of border phloxes ( Phlox paniculata and its cultivars); my heavy soil suits them. They need replanting every three or four years, but this gives me the opportunity of running tulips between their clumps and thereby pepping up an area in spring that would otherwise be rather dull. We did this with a late-flowering orange (flushed pink) tulip called 'Dillenburg', which is now coming up for its third season. And where there was initially one bulb, there are now clumps of several. Any gardener will appreciate how satisfying, not to say flattering, this is. The tulips really like us; hurrah! But how shall we act when we really must rejuvenate our phlox plantings? That cannot for much longer be delayed. We can do it in the autumn, but cannot contemplate pulling the border to pieces until November, as we pride ourselves on our lively October garden. By November, the tulips will already be making strong new roots and the check would be serious. The answer is that we shall lift them during the summer, while their tops are still visible but they are fully dormant; then store them until we are ready to plant in November. Stored dry, they will remain dormant. In other parts of the border, the tulips never need disturbing, as they are among perennials that detest disturbance. For instance, we have had the Darwin Hybrid 'Red Matador' with Eryngium x oliverianum for 30 years, and the tulip clumps are enormous",

Tests on healthy young men given a weekly injection of testosterone showed a 20% improvement in their verbal fluency skills within four weeks. The research, led by Daryl O'Connor from the University of Manchester, also found a reduced spatial ability among the men tested. The research, for the World Health Organisation, studied 30 men aged 18 to 40, half of whom were given a weekly injection of 200mg of testosterone for eight weeks, while the other half were given placebo injection. A 200mg dose of testosterone is the same as that contained in the male contraceptive, and suggests that the research may have wide ranging implications for male sexual functioning and anabolic steroid use, and also for other behaviour believed to be affected by hormones, such as road rage. The men were asked to perform a range of neuro-psychological tests after one week, four weeks and at the end of the study. As well as tests in motor co-ordination and memory recall, they were tested for verbal fluency. They were asked to name as many words as possible beginning with a particular letter in one minute, and this test was done three times. On average, all the men were able to name a total of 40 words in the first week, but while those who were not given testosterone did not improve their word count four weeks later, those given the hormone were able to name between six and eight extra words, a 20% increase. Although this improvement was sustained in week eight, there was no further improvement after week four. At the same time, the men given testosterone performed worse in spatial ability tests, such as map reading, than the men in the placebo group over the eight weeks of the study. Dr O'Connor said: \"This provides a preliminary insight that testosterone may have non-sexual benefits, with a role to play in mental functioning.

      "trailText": "<p>First Sofia Coppola was vilified as an actor in her father's film; now she is acclaimed for her debut as director. The linking thread is family tragedy</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was Francis Ford Coppola's desire - and certainly no one else's - that his daughter, Sofia, play the part of Mary, Michael Corleone's only daughter, in his production of The Godfather Part III. This was 1989. Sofia was 18 and had no experience of acting. The role had been intended for the equally young but by no means inexperienced actress Winona Ryder, but she arrived in Rome for her first day of shooting, December 28, suffering from nervous exhaustion, and on medical advice had to pull out with no notice. </p> <p>What was Coppola to do? Julia Roberts was willing but busy elsewhere - casting her would have meant suspending production for weeks - and he was already over budget and behind schedule. Madonna was ready and awaiting the call to get on the plane to Italy, but casting her would have meant rewriting the part of Mary for a woman more than 10 years older. And, as Coppola kept pointing out, \"She's meant to be Diane Keaton's daughter.\" </p> <p>Sofia was the right age. Sofia was the right look - half Italian, half WASP - exactly as Michael and Kay's daughter would look. And, more to the point, Sofia was there and, by all accounts, in bed asleep when the phone rang and her mum, Eleanor, woke her with the news that she was to be Mary, and to hurry up because she was expected at the studio. \"First, I am going to have a shower,\" Sofia said, not bolshie but cool. </p> <p>A soft-spoken woman, now 28, shy but fiercely observant and extremely intelligent - as her own directorial debut, The Virgin Suicides, reveals - she probably had a pretty strong sense of what lay behind her dad's decision. As, undoubtedly, did her mother, who did nothing to interpose herself between her daughter and her husband, even when all hell broke loose. </p> <p>Coppola, of course, is well known for casting his family in his films. His sister, Talia Shire, plays Michael's sister, Connie Corleone, throughout the three parts of The Godfather. But Shire is a professional actor, she screen-tested for the part against competition, even though Coppola himself had originally forbidden her to audition so as to avoid any charges of nepotism. His father, Carmine, and his mother, Italia, both had bit parts in the first Godfather; his wife and two sons appear as extras in the baptism scene. </p> <p>But the casting of Sofia in The Godfather Part III was different. Mary is a major part in the film, one of the strongest female characters Coppola has written. As the love interest of the aspirant new Don, Vincent Corleone, played by Andy Garcia, she has to have the pluck to go against her father's wishes; she also has to be a bit of a vamp capable of seducing her fiery cousin. Sofia's softness, a gaucheness - in the acting, in the girl - now up there on the celluloid for all to see, seemed to militate against his decision. </p> <p>Paramount Studios pleaded with Coppola to change his mind. They wanted someone they saw as \"hot\", they wanted \"the right heat\". In addition, Coppola, they said, would be making himself and Sofia vulnerable to the cruelty of the press. \"You know how cruel the press can be.\" His response was, \"I wanted her [Sofia] all along. I was fashioning Winona in her image.\" </p> <p>Looking back, Coppola was right, and Paramount was right. The press massacred Sofia. Critics referred to her \"gosling gracelessness\", her \"total lack of charisma\". They sneered at her voice - soft and weak. It was New Yorker critic Pauline Kael alone who seemed to understand something of her casting. \"It is obvious that this teenage girl is not a trained actress,\" Kael wrote. \"But . . . she gives the film a breath of life . . . I grew to like her.\" </p> <p>In the film, Sofia comes across as real. There are moments when she looks completely lost, especially during the come-on scenes with Garcia. But there are also moments of wonderful spontaneity, such as the dancing-scene with Pacino, her fictional father, when her real-life niece, the little daughter of Sofia's dead brother Gio, suddenly runs into shot clutching at her aunt's skirt. All of this directed by Sofia's real father. It was the fact that Sofia couldn't act, wasn't acting, that Coppola needed. Sofia was his bridge between the fiction and reality. And it was Sofia, and only Sofia, who could provide him with his ending. </p> <p>It seems odd now that it took so long to arrive at. As late as March 1990 (the film opened in America in December 1990), Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of The Godfather book, were exchanging letters over how Michael Corleone should die. Suicide? Illness? Puzo wanted him to go out in a hail of bullets - as Coppola had written it in the original script. But by now the director had changed his mind. Violent death, he said, is \"too easy\" for a man who has wasted his life doing all the wrong things for what he has persuaded himself are the right reasons. At the end of his life, Corleone knows he has lost everything of value. Coppola wanted some representation of this emotional suffering. He has Corleone survive his assassination attempt on the steps of the Teatro Massimo. The bullet meant for him kills Mary. We watch as Corleone tries to take in what has happened to him. In Pacino's silent scream we know that we are hearing the worst of grief - the death of a child. </p> <p>In May 1986, Coppola's own son, Gio, 22 years old, had died from head injuries after a speedboat accident. Some time after, Coppola said this: \"I realised that no matter what happened, I had lost . . . I could have all my fondest dreams come true . . . my dream of dream of dreams and . . . I had lost already . . . There will always be that part of me missing.\" </p> <p>Maybe it sounds selfish, this ravelling of grief to himself. Clearly there were others who suffered greatly. Gio's fianc\u00e9e, three months pregnant with their daughter, Gia. His mother. His younger brother, Roman, just 20, Sofia, 15. Griffin O'Neal, the actor Ryan O'Neal's son, who was drunk and driving the speedboat when his friend was killed. But maybe it is a feature of profound grief that it seems to be yours alone. Elsewhere, Coppola has said that it was seven years before he could wake in the morning and his first thought would not be of his son. </p> <p>So, in casting Sofia in The Godfather Part III, was he using her? Of course. He used her to help him to make some fictional representation of his own loss - because, maybe, this was the only way that he could force himself to face it. Using Sofia, he could go through the experience again, but this time with the protection and control of directorial distance. Now he could shape it, retrieve it from the senselessness of chance. He knew what he was doing. The character of Mary is abstract, a symbol of \"innocence killed\", he wrote later to Mario Puzo. And her killing is significant only in \"the effect and suffering it brings to Michael\". </p> <p>His wife, Eleanor Coppola, knew what he was doing. At the time, she wrote in her diary, \"Well-meaning people tell me I am permitting a form of child abuse.\" And his sister, Talia Shire, knew. In an interview in Vanity Fair magazine before the film was released, she said, \"She [Sofia] is basically structuring her father in this act, and she's doing a damned good job.\" Shire is probably right here. </p> <p> Sofia also knew what he was doing. She says now, \"He didn't make me do it. It was my choice.\" And, of her savaging by the film critics: \"I can't say it wasn't painful. It was hard, but not devastating.\" It taught her something, she says. \"That I didn't want to act.\" And later, \"When I started directing, it was helpful to know what it was like to be on the other side of the camera.\" </p> <p>It took her another 10 years to make the crossover, from one side of the camera to the other, from innocence to experience, you could say. It was a period of retreat from the movie world, during which she studied, then later took up careers in modelling and photography. But, having finally found herself in the right place, she directed a film, her own adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' serio-comic novel The Virgin Suicides, set in 1975, about a suburban family of five beautiful adolescent girls - the Lisbon sisters - who, one by one, all commit suicide, seemingly without motive. First the youngest, Cecilia (played by Hanna Hall, who throws herself from an upstairs window), then the other four. The story of their lives and deaths is narrated, 25 years on, by the young neighbourhood boys, now men, who lived opposite the Lisbon girls and were bewitched by them. What she loves about Eugenides' story, Sofia says, is its mixture of melancholy and light-heartedness. \"It's that sort of cosy melancholy that you feel when you are inside and outside it's raining.\" Its humour and tragedy. \"To me, it is not about the girls' suicides. It is about the boys who love them so much that, years later, when they've gone, they are still with them, serenading them.\" </p> <p>So there is nothing depressing about the film, she says, and despite its title, it is not about death. \"The girls are not real, you don't identify with them. That's why they are written in such a dreamy way.\" It is the boys' story. The girls' deaths are a metaphor. \"For the end of childhood, the loss of innocence.\" </p> <p>That a young woman should make a film about five young women committing suicide and yet consider that the young men who live on are the most interesting part of the story might seem odd. But Sofia made The Virgin Suicides from the point of view of a survivor. In that sense, it relates to her brother's death as it affected her. Just as the death of Mary Corleone in Godfather III reflected Coppola p\u00e8re's own experience. Sofia thinks she takes after her mother, but admits that her brother insists she takes after her father. </p> <p>She was the last child, born in 1971, six years after her brother Roman and eight years after Gio, and her dad was so delighted and surprised to have a girl in the family that he dropped his video camera and failed to film the birth. Her early life she measures out in her father's film locations. Birth was Godfather Part I, Italy; fifth birthday was Apocalypse Now, the Philippines. In her mother's fascinating documentary, Hearts Of Darkness, about the making of that movie, you sometimes see, in the background, these beautiful little blond things running around half-naked. </p> <p>\"We were all blond as kids,\" she says. \"Then the Italianness kicked in.\" For her 13th birth-day, her dad took her with him to Cuba. It was fun, she says, and he was fun. \"Bigger than life. Affectionate, youthful, enthusiastic.\" </p> <p>Her first home was a 28-room mansion in Pacific Heights, San Francisco, overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge. From here, with the money made from the first two Godfather films, the family moved to a 1,700-acre estate in the Napa Valley, where her parents still live and her dad has a winery. For most of her childhood, this was her base, the place they returned to. The family would traipse around after Coppola, \"like a circus family\". Her mother was \"the cool, down-to-earth one\", who'd try to impose some normality. It was sometimes hard moving around, \"always to be the new girl\". But, as Sofia says, \"Our lives were plentiful - I am fortunate and appreciative of that.\" </p> <p>None of them was especially clever at school. \"Ours was a different kind of education from most.\" And her parents, she says, were not overly ambitious for them. What mattered was family and, in particular, her dad's family. \"I am the only girl in the whole generation,\" she says. \"My dad's brother and sister both had three boys.\" She then corrects herself. \"I mean the only girl on the Italian side. My mum's brother has a daughter, but we don't see much of them.\" </p> <p>As siblings they were extremely close. \"I guess because we didn't have that many friends. The friends we tended to have were back in Napa.\" And as they grew up, each of her brothers gravitated towards the movie business. Gio, at 16, left school and went to work with his dad. Roman is a director of commercials. She was going to be the renegade, she says. \"Find a way out of film, the family business. All the family is in the business.\" And then, when she was 15, at precisely that moment as she says, \"when you are supposed to be enjoying yourself, breaking out\", Gio died. And everything went into a kind of suspension. Including her rebellion. </p> <p> She found out in a phone call that he was dead. \"O'Neal had driven their boat in between two other boats, not realising that one was being towed.\" The rope caught her brother, flung him back, causing massive injuries. Only minutes before, they had left Gio's pregnant girlfriend on the shore. Sofia couldn't bring herself to go and see the body. \"Sometimes I wonder if maybe I should have. Maybe seeing the body makes it more real for you. But I didn't want to have that image of him in my head forever. I'm glad I don't have that.\" </p> <p>It was such a pointless death, she says. \"It is hard to imagine there was any reason for it, though it changed all our lives forever.\" It forced her to look at her parents differently. \"You're so used to seeing them as strong. Then you realise they are not so strong, after all.\" Everyone goes through this. \"I just went through it younger. Realised that parents are mortal.\" You recover, she says, but you change. \"My mother is strong in a deep way, but it changed her.\" And, for herself, \"I am very different from the person I would have been if I had never known him and the things he taught me.\" That's all she can say, she explains. \"It is what the film [The Virgin Suicides] is about. That things happen for which there are no reasons. And if you try to find them, you won't.\" No pattern, then, no god? \"I can't say there is no god. I believe in something, some energy.\" But not, she says, in a benign, bearded man. </p> <p>From the moment she read The Virgin Suicides (a gift from the rock musician Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth), she knew she wanted to adapt it as a screenplay. She told her dad, who advised her against it, because somebody else had already bought the rights to the book and he didn't want her to be disappointed. There are loads of other books out there, he advised her, rather missing the point. But she went ahead anyway, wrote her own adaptation and, when he read it, Coppola was so impressed that he bought the script, and American Zoetrope, Coppola's company, produced the film. </p> <p>It was shot in 29 days, using a bit of family help - her brother Roman assisted with the diary montages - and friends. Her best friend Stephanie's little sister, Leslie Hayman, plays one of the Lisbon sisters, Therese. To begin with, despite having such heavy hitters as James Woods, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito in the cast, the film had no distribution in the US, only in Europe. \"I think they were put off by the title.\" But its acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival changed all that, and it opens in America and here in May. Fourteen years to the month after Gio's death. </p> <p>It's impossible not to see the film as her response to her brother's death. But it's hard to pin down in quite which way. Unlike The Godfather Part III - in which it is simple to transpose Corleone for Coppola - Sofia Coppola's film doesn't give itself up easily to parallels. She says, for instance, that she identifies with the boys who tell the story. This makes perfect sense. She stands back, as do they, from death. She then tries, as do they, to assimilate death into life. But the boys are half-seduced by death in a way that she isn't. Never could be. </p> <p>At another level, she is the girls. Their mean-age (13-17) is 15 - the same age she was when Gio died. And, like them, she is aware of the infectiousness of grief - one sister commits suicide, the others follow suit. In the novel, the haunting images of infection, rot, are even more abundant than in Coppola's adaptation. Like the girls in her film, Sofia had her teenage rebelliousness repressed - in the case of the girls, it is by a dominant, Bible-thumping mother, played by Kathleen Turner, who thinks she is protecting them by not letting them out of the house. In Sofia's case, it was sudden death, a different authority, that has closed the lid and weighed it down. </p> <p>Celebratory is the word that Coppola herself uses to describe her film. There is a fabulous sequence when 14-year-old Lux (Kirsten Dunst), the youngest surviving child, is crowned queen of the homecoming ball with her date, Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett), the prettiest boy anyone ever laid eyes on. He abandons her, post-coital, on the football pitch in the middle of the night, so she awakens at dawn, alone. </p> <p>Nothing in the film has prepared you for this. And yet you knew it all along; the experience is common. What is not common is the mother's reaction: to gate all her children, forever. So death becomes the inevitable, even enviable, escape. And the girls choose it - there's even a kind of relish about it. I can do this and frighten you so much you will never forget it. Which is probably right: this is how death strikes you, certainly when you are young. Like a bully. </p> <p>Last year, at a low-key family ceremony at the Napa estate, Sofia married Spike Jonze, the actor and director of the successful film Being John Malkovich. They could be media darlings. But somehow, looking at Sofia, it's hard to envisage. She likes things simple. They want children, of course, \"in time\". </p> <p>It was William Faulkner who wrote that given the choice between grief and nothing, \"we have to choose grief\". It's hard, this notion of choosing grief; it's not a child's notion, and in the The Virgin Suicides the young girls choose, naturally, the melodramatic way out. It is done so softly, so gently, as is Sofia's way, that we may almost miss the point. Death is not the Edgar Allen Poe-ish stranger at the feast, the insidious plague among us. Death is something that happens. \"It is part of life,\" Sofia says. \"That's what makes it so hard.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Virgin Suicides opens on May 19.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was Francis Ford Coppola's desire - and certainly no one else's - that his daughter, Sofia, play the part of Mary, Michael Corleone's only daughter, in his production of The Godfather Part III. This was 1989. Sofia was 18 and had no experience of acting. The role had been intended for the equally young but by no means inexperienced actress Winona Ryder, but she arrived in Rome for her first day of shooting, December 28, suffering from nervous exhaustion, and on medical advice had to pull out with no notice. What was Coppola to do? Julia Roberts was willing but busy elsewhere - casting her would have meant suspending production for weeks - and he was already over budget and behind schedule. Madonna was ready and awaiting the call to get on the plane to Italy, but casting her would have meant rewriting the part of Mary for a woman more than 10 years older. And, as Coppola kept pointing out, \"She's meant to be Diane Keaton's daughter.\" Sofia was the right age. Sofia was the right look - half Italian, half WASP - exactly as Michael and Kay's daughter would look. And, more to the point, Sofia was there and, by all accounts, in bed asleep when the phone rang and her mum, Eleanor, woke her with the news that she was to be Mary, and to hurry up because she was expected at the studio. \"First, I am going to have a shower,\" Sofia said, not bolshie but cool. A soft-spoken woman, now 28, shy but fiercely observant and extremely intelligent - as her own directorial debut, The Virgin Suicides, reveals - she probably had a pretty strong sense of what lay behind her dad's decision. As, undoubtedly, did her mother, who did nothing to interpose herself between her daughter and her husband, even when all hell broke loose. Coppola, of course, is well known for casting his family in his films. His sister, Talia Shire, plays Michael's sister, Connie Corleone, throughout the three parts of The Godfather. But Shire is a professional actor, she screen-tested for the part against competition, even though Coppola himself had originally forbidden her to audition so as to avoid any charges of nepotism. His father, Carmine, and his mother, Italia, both had bit parts in the first Godfather; his wife and two sons appear as extras in the baptism scene. But the casting of Sofia in The Godfather Part III was different. Mary is a major part in the film, one of the strongest female characters Coppola has written. As the love interest of the aspirant new Don, Vincent Corleone, played by Andy Garcia, she has to have the pluck to go against her father's wishes; she also has to be a bit of a vamp capable of seducing her fiery cousin. Sofia's softness, a gaucheness - in the acting, in the girl - now up there on the celluloid for all to see, seemed to militate against his decision. Paramount Studios pleaded with Coppola to change his mind. They wanted someone they saw as \"hot\", they wanted \"the right heat\". In addition, Coppola, they said, would be making himself and Sofia vulnerable to the cruelty of the press. \"You know how cruel the press can be.\" His response was, \"I wanted her [Sofia] all along. I was fashioning Winona in her image.\" Looking back, Coppola was right, and Paramount was right. The press massacred Sofia. Critics referred to her \"gosling gracelessness\", her \"total lack of charisma\". They sneered at her voice - soft and weak. It was New Yorker critic Pauline Kael alone who seemed to understand something of her casting. \"It is obvious that this teenage girl is not a trained actress,\" Kael wrote. \"But . . . she gives the film a breath of life . . . I grew to like her.\" In the film, Sofia comes across as real. There are moments when she looks completely lost, especially during the come-on scenes with Garcia. But there are also moments of wonderful spontaneity, such as the dancing-scene with Pacino, her fictional father, when her real-life niece, the little daughter of Sofia's dead brother Gio, suddenly runs into shot clutching at her aunt's skirt. All of this directed by Sofia's real father. It was the fact that Sofia couldn't act, wasn't acting, that Coppola needed. Sofia was his bridge between the fiction and reality. And it was Sofia, and only Sofia, who could provide him with his ending. It seems odd now that it took so long to arrive at. As late as March 1990 (the film opened in America in December 1990), Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of The Godfather book, were exchanging letters over how Michael Corleone should die. Suicide? Illness? Puzo wanted him to go out in a hail of bullets - as Coppola had written it in the original script. But by now the director had changed his mind. Violent death, he said, is \"too easy\" for a man who has wasted his life doing all the wrong things for what he has persuaded himself are the right reasons. At the end of his life, Corleone knows he has lost everything of value. Coppola wanted some representation of this emotional suffering. He has Corleone survive his assassination attempt on the steps of the Teatro Massimo. The bullet meant for him kills Mary. We watch as Corleone tries to take in what has happened to him. In Pacino's silent scream we know that we are hearing the worst of grief - the death of a child. In May 1986, Coppola's own son, Gio, 22 years old, had died from head injuries after a speedboat accident. Some time after, Coppola said this: \"I realised that no matter what happened, I had lost . . . I could have all my fondest dreams come true . . . my dream of dream of dreams and . . . I had lost already . . . There will always be that part of me missing.\" Maybe it sounds selfish, this ravelling of grief to himself. Clearly there were others who suffered greatly. Gio's fianc\u00e9e, three months pregnant with their daughter, Gia. His mother. His younger brother, Roman, just 20, Sofia, 15. Griffin O'Neal, the actor Ryan O'Neal's son, who was drunk and driving the speedboat when his friend was killed. But maybe it is a feature of profound grief that it seems to be yours alone. Elsewhere, Coppola has said that it was seven years before he could wake in the morning and his first thought would not be of his son. So, in casting Sofia in The Godfather Part III, was he using her? Of course. He used her to help him to make some fictional representation of his own loss - because, maybe, this was the only way that he could force himself to face it. Using Sofia, he could go through the experience again, but this time with the protection and control of directorial distance. Now he could shape it, retrieve it from the senselessness of chance. He knew what he was doing. The character of Mary is abstract, a symbol of \"innocence killed\", he wrote later to Mario Puzo. And her killing is significant only in \"the effect and suffering it brings to Michael\". His wife, Eleanor Coppola, knew what he was doing. At the time, she wrote in her diary, \"Well-meaning people tell me I am permitting a form of child abuse.\" And his sister, Talia Shire, knew. In an interview in Vanity Fair magazine before the film was released, she said, \"She [Sofia] is basically structuring her father in this act, and she's doing a damned good job.\" Shire is probably right here. Sofia also knew what he was doing. She says now, \"He didn't make me do it. It was my choice.\" And, of her savaging by the film critics: \"I can't say it wasn't painful. It was hard, but not devastating.\" It taught her something, she says. \"That I didn't want to act.\" And later, \"When I started directing, it was helpful to know what it was like to be on the other side of the camera.\" It took her another 10 years to make the crossover, from one side of the camera to the other, from innocence to experience, you could say. It was a period of retreat from the movie world, during which she studied, then later took up careers in modelling and photography. But, having finally found herself in the right place, she directed a film, her own adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' serio-comic novel The Virgin Suicides, set in 1975, about a suburban family of five beautiful adolescent girls - the Lisbon sisters - who, one by one, all commit suicide, seemingly without motive. First the youngest, Cecilia (played by Hanna Hall, who throws herself from an upstairs window), then the other four. The story of their lives and deaths is narrated, 25 years on, by the young neighbourhood boys, now men, who lived opposite the Lisbon girls and were bewitched by them. What she loves about Eugenides' story, Sofia says, is its mixture of melancholy and light-heartedness. \"It's that sort of cosy melancholy that you feel when you are inside and outside it's raining.\" Its humour and tragedy. \"To me, it is not about the girls' suicides. It is about the boys who love them so much that, years later, when they've gone, they are still with them, serenading them.\" So there is nothing depressing about the film, she says, and despite its title, it is not about death. \"The girls are not real, you don't identify with them. That's why they are written in such a dreamy way.\" It is the boys' story. The girls' deaths are a metaphor. \"For the end of childhood, the loss of innocence.\" That a young woman should make a film about five young women committing suicide and yet consider that the young men who live on are the most interesting part of the story might seem odd. But Sofia made The Virgin Suicides from the point of view of a survivor. In that sense, it relates to her brother's death as it affected her. Just as the death of Mary Corleone in Godfather III reflected Coppola p\u00e8re's own experience. Sofia thinks she takes after her mother, but admits that her brother insists she takes after her father. She was the last child, born in 1971, six years after her brother Roman and eight years after Gio, and her dad was so delighted and surprised to have a girl in the family that he dropped his video camera and failed to film the birth. Her early life she measures out in her father's film locations. Birth was Godfather Part I, Italy; fifth birthday was Apocalypse Now, the Philippines.

Even a single small dose of ginseng, a plant extract sold over the counter in Britain, can sharpen up memory while a small dose of ginkgo biloba can significantly improve concentration.

Psychologist Andrew Scholey, from the University of Northumbria, who led the research, said: \"The holy grail of cognitive enhancement is a drug that will improve both memory and concentration. \"These two herbs added together have shown a remarkable finding. \"What seems to be happening is that this drug is improving the mental energy available for cognitive performance as people go about their day-to-day business.\" Dr Scholey's team tested 20 participants on four separate days, giving them three different doses of each of the plant extracts and one placebo, but the participants were not told which they were getting on which day. Even after just one dose of ginkgo biloba, the volunteers displayed much faster reaction times in tests requiring concentration. Coffee drinkers could find that their caffeine \"buzz\" is all in the mind Dr Scholey said people who were given decaffeinated coffee but told that it contained caffeine were able to perform mental tasks faster, just as if they had drunk caffeine.

      "bodyText": "A governor whose outspoken views made her a \"thorn in the side\" of the prison service yesterday won her claim for victimisation under the Sex Discrimination Act. An employment tribunal in Manchester found in favour of Katie Dawson, 56, the former governor of Risley women's prison in Cheshire. It had been told that Mrs Dawson, who had complained about conditions, only learned her prison was to be shut at a staff meeting. She also said she had been denied the chance to apply for other jobs and had been isolated. After the ruling, the service agreed \u00a36,000 to compensate for injured feelings. Mrs Dawson said: \"Money never was the issue. \"These proceedings were brought to alert the public to [conditions], not just at Risley but everywhere. That is why they didn't like me - because I spoke out.\" However, the tribunal said it found the treatment of Mrs Dawson, who still works in a senior post, was partly due to an earlier claim of sex discrimination that had led the service to see her, a \"dedicated and capable woman\", as a thorn in its side.",

The murder was one of \"extreme brutality for sexual pleasure\", Mr Justice Toulson said at Exeter crown court. The victim, George Mortimer, 16, lived in Exeter and was a pupil at St Peter's high school. He suffered more than 30 head wounds and 12 fractures from the claw hammer Colling wielded during a canal-side meeting on January 29 last year. The schoolboy was to have gone on to a party after meeting Colling, who used drug deals as a means of getting close to young men and boys, the jury had been told. Colling denied the killing but was linked to it by DNA, the court had heard. The defendant's flatmate and former lover, Damien Sinclair, gave evidence for the prosecution, and told how Colling, who came originally from Exeter, had confessed to the killing when he returned to their flat in Cheshire. He said that Colling, whom he met in jail, had once spoken of his fantasy about kidnapping the schoolboy, doing what he wanted with him sexually, then killing him. The judge told Colling that he believed he would be a risk to young men until he lost all interest in sex due to old age. \"I shall be alarmed if anyone were to consider your release before then,\" he said.",

CAT makes libraries of human antibodies for use by drugs companies. In March, after a tie-up with one of the most aggressive new US biotech companies, Human Genome Sciences, its stock market value broke through the \u00a31bn barrier.</p> <p>Peter Fellner heads another biotech billion-pound firm, Celltech, a survivor from an earlier wave of biotech start-ups, which is unusual among companies of its kind in generating revenues from a local anaesthetic called Chirocaine. Recent drugs licensing problems in the US are a reminder that Silicon Fen trades on risk.</p> <p>Adam Twiss and Damian Reeves, who set up their internet software firm, Zeus Technologies, while they were students at Cambridge and are still in their early 20s, are the favourite duo for those who like to claim that Silicon Valley's campus-to-enterprise culture really is at work in East Anglia.</p> <p>ARM Holdings, headed by Robin Saxby - who does not live in Cambridgeshire, preferring to live closer to Heathrow airport, but still runs a sizeable part of his operation there - is one of the most solidly-based success stories of Silicon Fen. Its power-frugal microchips are to be found in many of the world's mobile phones. Two years after it was floated, it is worth almost \u00a38bn.</p> <p>Perhaps the most remarkable rise of all the firms in the Cambridge cluster is that of Autonomy and its founder, Mike Lynch, 34.</p> <p>Text analysis software based on the maths of an 18th century clergyman trying to prove the existence of God does not sound to the layman like a realistic business proposition.</p> <p>And that's exactly what Lynch found when he took his idea to bankers and venture capitalists. But at the age of 23, a former pop promoter lent him \u00a32,000 on a hunch, and the rest is history.</p> <p>Lynch's company is worth about \u00a34bn, with a fifth of that owned by Lynch himself.</p> <p>Autonomy illustrates one of the paradoxes of Silicon Fen: the tiny number of employees in many of the firms. For all its paper value, the company has just 160 employees.</p> <p>Lynch, who wears his wealth lightly, is confident. \"The model is very clean. To double our revenues, we just have to ship two CDs of software.\"</p> <p>But there have been failures in Cambridge.</p> <p>From his office, Lynch can see the empty hulk of the Ionica building, headquarters of a company with an innovative idea for cable-free fixed phone lines, which in 1997 floated on the stock market, soared in value to hundreds of millions of pounds, and went bust 15 months later.</p> <p>Some entrepreneurs sold out while the going was good and linger on in the county, passing acid comments on the new wave.</p> <p>Peter Dawe, who made a relatively modest \u00a336m when he sold his share in the internet service provider, Unipalm Pipiex, four years ago, was dismissive of the virtues of Silicon Fen when Microsoft first announced their research centre in 1997.</p> <p>\"Anyone who has been to Silicon Valley, which was once one of the most beautiful valleys in the world, will know this is not a good thing.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.siliconfen.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">Silicon Fen</a></p>",

Prominent among the movers and shakers of Cambridge is David Chiswell, head of the biotechnology company, Cambridge Antibody Technology. CAT makes libraries of human antibodies for use by drugs companies. In March, after a tie-up with one of the most aggressive new US biotech companies, Human Genome Sciences, its stock market value broke through the \u00a31bn barrier. Peter Fellner heads another biotech billion-pound firm, Celltech, a survivor from an earlier wave of biotech start-ups, which is unusual among companies of its kind in generating revenues from a local anaesthetic called Chirocaine. Recent drugs licensing problems in the US are a reminder that Silicon Fen trades on risk. Adam Twiss and Damian Reeves, who set up their internet software firm, Zeus Technologies, while they were students at Cambridge and are still in their early 20s, are the favourite duo for those who like to claim that Silicon Valley's campus-to-enterprise culture really is at work in East Anglia. ARM Holdings, headed by Robin Saxby - who does not live in Cambridgeshire, preferring to live closer to Heathrow airport, but still runs a sizeable part of his operation there - is one of the most solidly-based success stories of Silicon Fen. Its power-frugal microchips are to be found in many of the world's mobile phones. Two years after it was floated, it is worth almost \u00a38bn. Perhaps the most remarkable rise of all the firms in the Cambridge cluster is that of Autonomy and its founder, Mike Lynch, 34. Text analysis software based on the maths of an 18th century clergyman trying to prove the existence of God does not sound to the layman like a realistic business proposition. And that's exactly what Lynch found when he took his idea to bankers and venture capitalists. But at the age of 23, a former pop promoter lent him \u00a32,000 on a hunch, and the rest is history. Lynch's company is worth about \u00a34bn, with a fifth of that owned by Lynch himself. Autonomy illustrates one of the paradoxes of Silicon Fen: the tiny number of employees in many of the firms. For all its paper value, the company has just 160 employees. Lynch, who wears his wealth lightly, is confident. \"The model is very clean. To double our revenues, we just have to ship two CDs of software.\" But there have been failures in Cambridge. From his office, Lynch can see the empty hulk of the Ionica building, headquarters of a company with an innovative idea for cable-free fixed phone lines, which in 1997 floated on the stock market, soared in value to hundreds of millions of pounds, and went bust 15 months later. Some entrepreneurs sold out while the going was good and linger on in the county, passing acid comments on the new wave. Peter Dawe, who made a relatively modest \u00a336m when he sold his share in the internet service provider, Unipalm Pipiex, four years ago, was dismissive of the virtues of Silicon Fen when Microsoft first announced their research centre in 1997. \"Anyone who has been to Silicon Valley, which was once one of the most beautiful valleys in the world, will know this is not a good thing.\" Silicon Fen",

He was not alone in his outrage. Like Edward Bond's Saved before it, and Sarah Kane's Blasted since, Howard Brenton's Romans fell victim to critical blindness, moral outrage and tabloid titillation. Few could see beyond the play's most famous scene: the anal and oral homosexual rape of a naked young Celt by soldiers in the invading Roman army. </p> <p>That self-styled moral guardian of the nation, Mary Whitehouse, had neither seen nor read the play, but that didn't stop her launching a private prosecution against the director, Michael Bogdanov, accusing him of effectively acting as a pimp by procuring people to perform immoral acts. </p> <p>After a year as a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, the case was withdrawn. The hue and cry subsided, and The Romans in Britain faded into obscurity as a footnote to British theatre history. </p> <p>Twenty years on, it is hard to see what the fuss was all about. The Romans in Britain - getting its first London revival at the tiny Man in the Moon theatre in Chelsea - is still shocking; but it is not the onstage buggery that makes you reel and want to cover your face with your hands. After all, anal sex is all the rage on the London stage, with Giuseppe Manfridi's painful farce Cuckoos packing them in at the Gate. </p> <p>No, the thing that makes you push yourself back in your seat as far as you can go is the relentless agony of a play that is suffused with sorrow at the inhumanity of mankind - our self-perpetuating, self-destructive violence and our wicked, wicked hearts. </p> <p>This is an intensely moral play, and there is a strange kind of beauty in its ferocity. As with the stoning of the baby in Bond's Saved, and the obscenities of Kane's Blasted, the acts of appalling violence are not gratuitous but organic. The rape has little to do with sex and everything to do with power. \"Nig-nogs\" is how the invading Romans refer to the Celts, robbing them of their humanity. Things not people. </p> <p>What Brenton captures is the terror of living constantly on the edge and with the expectation that the world you know could end at any moment - that your way of life, all your beliefs, could be snuffed out almost overnight by an occupying force. On mainland Britain, where we have lived for hundreds of years free from invasion, that may be hard for us to get our heads round. But if you live in Ireland, the Balkans, Africa or many other parts of the world, that fear becomes part of your psyche. As the young girl abducted and sold into slavery points out, fear breeds violence. \"Now home is where I have a stone in my hand,\" she says. There is no room for compassion in this world. </p> <p>Brenton picks over these bones of history - and the \"get off my land\" mentality - with a ravenous intensity, only faltering when he attempts to make direct links with England's involvement in Ireland. The modern scenes, set in an Irish field where British soldiers patrol and Republicans hold sway, are much more crudely written, and while you applaud Brenton's political fervour, you wish it were not at the expense of his playwriting skill. If this work has failed to become a classic, like Saved and Blasted, it is because its specificity to Ireland makes it both less universal and more dated. </p> <p>But it is undoubtedly worth reviving, not least for its huge sweep and its grim humour. The evening ends on a joke as two cooks, realising that their employment prospects in a time of war are slim, turn storytellers and invent the myth of King Arthur. The unknowability of history and the way it is manufactured have seldom been better demonstrated on stage. There are good things too in David Craik's production: the intimate space makes this epic a genuinely full-frontal experience, and there are some some impressive performances, particularly from Michael Hucks (who plays both Caesar and a British intelligence officer) and Michael Kurchener (the rape victim Marban). </p> <p>It is worth remembering that The Romans in Britain was premiered in 1980, closer chronologically to the era of censorship (abolished in 1968) than to the 21st century and our ready acceptance of such sexually explicit plays such as Shopping and Fucking. Perhaps it is a sign of how much audiences' sensibilities and concerns have changed that the show's programme does not warn us of nudity, violence, strong language or buggery.

Deep inside an Italian mountain, scientists are attempting to detect the signatures created by particles of dark matter.

They were giddy at the prospect and the potential: Italian scientists and invisible hippos dancing a celebratory jig beneath a 1,400ft mountain.

But while some of his points were highly dubious - his near-demonisation of some non-governmental organisations and the rewriting of how great for the environment his own party was when in government - his talk struck the right balance between appealing to the specially invited, especially interested, audience and to the just-tuned-in radio (or, indeed, internet) listener. Having learned about political ecosystems from Patten, Leading Edge (Radio 4, Thursday) revealed all about another baffling science - particle physics. Since the sum total of my knowledge of physics is derived from watching Star Trek and The X-Files (which, I admit, may not be the most reliable teachers), Geoff Watts telling all about dark matter was a revelation. Deep inside an Italian mountain, scientists are attempting to detect the signatures created by particles of dark matter. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (Wimps), probably constitute 90% of the matter in the universe (hence the Massive) but since they are almost impossible to detect (hence Weakly Interacting), no one is quite sure. For some reason, this analysis made me think of the balletic hippos in Fantasia, invisible to the naked eye but swirling around, swathed in acres of taffeta. Probably happily (for I always thought dark matter was bad because that's what Agent Mulder said), the Italians think they have found Wimps, and in significant numbers too (a host of hippos, as it were). They were giddy at the prospect and the potential: Italian scientists and invisible hippos dancing a celebratory jig beneath a 1,400ft mountain. You see what happens when you rely on popular culture for your education? \u0095 Anne Karpf is away.",

      "body": "<p>The rains come to Kerala for months at a time. It is the greenest state in India: hot and humid, still and brooding. The soil is so fertile that as you drift up the lotus-choked waterways, the trees close in around you, as twisting tropical fan vaults of palm and bamboo arch together in the forest canopy. Mango trees hang heavy over the fishermen's skiffs; pepper vines creep through the fronds of the waterside papaya orchards. </p> <p>In this country live a people who believe that St Thomas - the apostle of Jesus who famously refused to believe in the resurrection \"until I have placed my hands in the holes left by the nails and the wound left by the spear\" - came to India from Palestine after the Resurrection, and that he baptised their ancestors. Moreover, this is not a modern tradition: it has been the firm conviction of the Christians here since at least the sixth century AD. </p> <p>In 594 AD, the French monastic chronicler Gregory of Tours met a wandering Greek monk who reported that, in southern India, he had met Christians who had told him about St Thomas's missionary journey to India and who had shown him the tomb of the apostle. Over the centuries to come, almost every western traveller to southern India, from Marco Polo to the first Portuguese conquistadors, reported the same story. </p> <p>The legend of St Thomas led to the first-ever recorded journey to India by an Englishman: according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, King Alfred (he of the burned cakes) sent Bishop Sighelm of Sherborne \"to St Thomas in India\"; years later, the bishop returned, carrying with him \"precious stones and the odiferous essences of that country\". </p> <p>The stories that the travellers brought back with them varied little: all said how in India, St Thomas was universally believed to have arrived in AD 52 from Palestine by boat; that he had travelled down the Red Sea and across the Persian Gulf, and that he landed at the great Keralan port of Cranganore, the spice trading centre to which the Roman Red Sea merchant fleet would head each year, to buy pepper and Indian slave girls for the Mediterranean market. </p> <p>In Kerala, St Thomas was said to have converted the local Brahmins with the aid of miracles and to have built seven churches. He then headed eastwards to the ancient temple town of Mylapore, now in the suburbs of Madras. There the saint was opposed by the orthodox Brahmins of the temple, and finally martyred. His followers built a tomb and monastery over his grave which, said the travellers, was now a pilgrimage centre for Muslims and Hindus, as well as Christians in southern India. </p> <p>Although the historicity of the legend is unprovable, the modern St Thomas Christians - as they still call themselves - regard this tradition as more than a myth: it is an article of faith which underpins religious beliefs, identity and their place in Indian society. It is a tradition they go to extraordinary lengths to preserve and to propagate - not least by establishing what is almost certainly Christianity's only troupe of dancing nuns. </p> <p>Moreover they are agreed - as are many of their Hindu neigh bours - that St Thomas is not dead: that he is still present in Kerala, guarding his followers and guiding his church. This was palpable at the small \"miracle church\" of Putenangadi, south of Cochin. At a time when the violent conflict between Hindus and Christians in north India was making headlines across the world, members of both faiths could be found side by side crammed into the same church, all convinced that St Thomas was present in the building to answer the prayers of his devotees. </p> <p>At the back of his church, I came across an old Hindu woman named Jaya. I asked her why she chose to pray in a Christian church: \"So that I can be relieved of all my troubles,\" she replied. \"It is that faith that brings me here. If there's anything I need, I ask St Thomas for it.\" </p> <p>\"But, as a Hindu, why would you come to a Christian church?,\" I asked. \"Why not go to the temple?\" \"Because I have faith,\" she repeated simply. \"When I have difficulties, St Thomas solves them for me. Of course, I go to the temple too. But any big problem I have, I come here and I pray, and my prayers are always answered. For me, St Thomas is definitely alive.\" </p> <p>Later, Jaya introduced me to her Christian friend, Miriam. \"In my experience, praying to St Thomas here is always effective,\" said Miriam. \"Whatever I need I pray for and my prayers are heard and answered. Of course, there is God, but it is St Thomas's name that we call. He is all I have.\" </p> <p>The trail of St Thomas's journey to India begins thousands of miles from Kerala in the deserts of the Middle East. In the sixth century, the Byzantine empire was beginning to crumble under a wave of attacks, and the great classical cities of the east Mediterranean were falling into ruin and decay. As their libraries and universities were burned down or deserted, many of the most important manuscripts were preserved in the library of a remote monastery in the deserts of the Sinai now known as St Catherine's. </p> <p>Its great walls and sheer isolation preserved it from attacks for centuries. Protected from their enemies, the monks accumulated one of the greatest treasuries of icons and illuminated manuscripts in the Christian world. Scholars who penetrated the region in the 19th century were astonished to find in the monastery a library of unmatched richness, containing lost works by great classical authors and the oldest extant copy of the New Testament. </p> <p>But perhaps the strangest discovery of all was a previously unknown early Christian text dating from the fourth century AD entitled the Acts of St Thomas. The manuscript told a story that had been forgotten in the traditions of the western Church. According to the Acts, St Thomas was Jesus's twin (the Syriac for Thomas - Te'oma - means twin, as does his Greek name, Didymos); like his brother, he was a carpenter from Galilee. </p> <p>After Jesus's death, according to the Acts, the apostle had been summoned to India - and his martyrdom - by a mysterious king, Gondophares. Biblical scholars of the 19th century were at first very sceptical of the Acts of St Thomas. They correctly pointed out that the story contained many clearly apocryphal Gnostic elements, and that the earliest surviving version of the text, written in fourth century Mesopotamia, dated from at least two centuries after the events described; up to the beginning of this century, the document was sometimes dismissed as a pious romance. </p> <p>Nevertheless over the past 100 years, as research has progressed both into ancient Indian history and the links between India and the Roman Middle East, a series of remarkable discoveries have gone a long way to prove that the story contained in the Acts seems to be built on surprisingly solid historical foundations. First, British archaeologists working in late 19th-century India began to find hoards of coins belonging to a previously unknown Indian king: the Rajah Gondophares, who ruled from AD19 to AD45. If St Thomas had ever been summoned to India, it would have been Rajah Gondophares who would have done it, just as the Acts had always maintained. </p> <p>The fact that the Acts had accurately preserved the name of an obscure Indian rajah, whose name and lineage had disappeared, implied that it must contain at least a nucleus of genuine historical information. Archaeological discoveries have since confirmed many other details of the story, revealing that maritime contacts between the Roman world and India were much more extensive than anyone had realised. </p> <p>In the 1930s, Sir Mortimer Wheeler discovered and excavated a major Roman trading station on the south Indian coast, while other scholars unearthed references showing that in Thomas's time, the trick of sailing with the monsoon had just been discovered, reducing the journey time from the Red Sea to India to just under 40 days. According to a previously overlooked remark by Strabo, first- century geographer and historian, 200 Roman trading vessels a year were making the annual journey to the bazaars of Malabar and back. </p> <p>More intriguing still, analysis of Roman coin hoards in India has shown that the Roman spice trade peaked exactly in the middle of the first century AD. All this showed that if St Thomas had wanted to come to India, the passage from Palestine, far from being near-impossible, would in fact have been easier, more frequent and probably cheaper than at anytime in the next 1,500 years - until Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route to the Indies in 1498. </p> <p>Scholars discovered further confirmation of the Acts in the practices of the St Thomas Christians. Since the second world war, theologians have become increasingly aware of the Jewishness of Jesus and his first disciples: it has become apparent, for example, that the first Christians of the early church- those who knew Jesus and his teaching personally - would have carried on going to the temple in Jerusalem, performing sacrifices and circumcisions, and obeying the Jewish food laws. </p> <p>If St Thomas had carried Christianity to India, it is likely that he would have taken a distinctly more Jewish form than the Gentile-friendly version developed for the Greeks of Antioch by St Paul and later exported to Europe. Hence the importance of the fact that some of the St Thomas Christian churches to this day retain Judeo-Christian practices long dropped in the west - such as the celebration of the solemn Passover feast. </p> <p>Hence also the significance of the St Thomas Christians still using the two earliest Christian liturgies in existence: the Mass of Addai and Mari, and the Liturgy of St James, once used by the early Church of Jerusalem. More remarkable still, these ancient services are still partly sung in Aramaic, the language spoken by Jesus and St Thomas. </p> <p>The more you investigate the evidence, the more irresistible is the conclusion that whether or not St Thomas himself came to India, he certainly could have. And if he didn't make the journey, it seems certain that some other very early Christian missionary did, for there is certainly evidence for a substantial Christian population in India by at least the third century. </p> <p>And if there is no documentary proof to clinch the case, there is at least a very good reason for its absence: for the entire historical documentation of the St Thomas Christians was reduced to ashes in the 16th century - not by Muslims or Hindus, but by a newly arrived European Christian power: the Portuguese. As far as the Portuguese colonial authorities were concerned, the St Thomas Christians were heretics, an idea confirmed by their belief in astrology and reincarnation, and the Hindu-style sculptures of elephants and dancing girls found carved on their crosses. </p> <p>Notions that they might also have maintained early Christian traditions predating the arrival of the faith in Europe were dismissed out of hand. The Inquisition was brought in, and the historical records of the St Thomas Christians put to the flame. Yet the old stories did survive, locked in the minds and memories of Christians in inaccessible Keralan backwaters. </p> <p>In songs and dances passed on from father to son and teacher to pupil, they preserved intact many of their most ancient traditions. Scholars now believe that if the answer to the riddle of the legends of St Thomas lies anywhere, it is in this rich and largely unstudied Keralan oral tradition. </p> <p>The man who has done more than anything to preserve this heritage is a plump catholic priest and village schoolteacher named Father Jacob Vellian. Working in isolation in his spare time, with little help and pitiful resources, Fr Jacob has since 1973 single-handedly travelled from village to village in Kerala systematically collecting Christian songs and dances about St Thomas's travels and exploits in India. </p> <p>On two occasions, hidden in remote villages, he stumbled across palm-leaf books from the 16th century, which preserved other fragments of the songs and ballads in tiny Malayalam lettering: the oldest surviving documentation of the St Thomas Christians. There were, he discovered, still current in the Keralan countryside, hundreds of songs recording the deeds of St Thomas, as well two ancient full-length ballads, the older of which, The Margam Kali Pattu or Song of the Way, was of epic proportions. </p> <p>Both these ballads predated the coming of the Portuguese and both, from their very archaic language, showed every sign of dating from the earliest centuries AD. </p> <p>Almost everywhere Fr Vellian found the oral tradition on the verge of extinction, with the young people unwilling to carry on the job of learning by heart the complex stanzas. In several places he was able to record lost fragments of the epics just weeks before the last of the asans (or village bards) died, taking their songs to their grave. \"Over the years I have tried to meet with every Christian asan in Kerala,\" Vellian told me. \"Most of them were illiterate: isolated old men who were only barely aware of the importance of what they were clinging on to. Some had a few disciples and were very eager to teach what they knew; others had none. But no one was trying to write down what they had preserved. No one was promoting them or rewarding them for their work. </p> <p>\"As a result much must have been lost: not one asan knew the whole of the two longest ballads: some knew 20%; some 70%. But the 14 sections that we now have seems to be the whole of The Song of the Way, and the job now is to study this and to make sure it is passed on.\" To that end, Vellian has been building on another, almost lost Keralan tradition: the dancing nuns of Malabar. Fr Vellian has spent the last few years training up some of the many hundreds of nuns of Kerala to dance the ancient dances of St Thomas, and groups of wimpled sisters can now be seen swaying uncertainly to the beat of the tabla as they attempt to master the dances which tell of the apostle's travels. In this way, what may be the last surviving link with the tradition of the apostles is now being preserved by a group of south Indian Whoopi Goldbergs. </p> <p>Fr Vellian is adamant that the oral traditions have accurately preserved a series of texts that may well hold vital clues which could help prove the St Thomas legend: \"The palm-leaf documents that we have collected show how accurately the bards have preserved the text,\" he says. \"Here or there a word may have changed, in the 300 years since the earliest was written down, but by and large the versions we have collected in the fields are consistent both with each other and these palm leaf-texts. These traditions are an authentic and incredibly valuable and ancient source of Christian history, and should be respected as such.\" </p> <p>Vellian is right. For while Christianity has never been a major faith in India, it is a religion with deep roots, which has clung on with incredible tenacity, despite all the odds. Above all, the church here has remained faithful to the tradition of St Thomas's journey from Palestine to India. It is a story long forgotten in a west which has come to regard itself as the true home of the faith, forgetting that in essence, Christianity is an eastern religion. </p> <p>Before leaving Kerala, I asked Dr Vellian whether he really believed his work would eventually provide some conclusive evidence to prove St Thomas's journey. \"In the end, we are the evidence,\" he said. \"We have a very ancient, unbroken tradition that St. Thomas was the founder of the church in India. Our traditions are unanimous that he came here, and that is something we have held on to, despite persecution, for 1,700 years. Our spirituality is very close to that of the early church and we believe our church is as old as any Apostolic Church in the world. Our songs and traditions are quite clear about this. In the end it is these traditions that we base our belief on: not something on paper or stone which is secondary. It is our fidelity to St Thomas that is most important to us.\" </p> <p>\u0095 William Dalrymple's film, Doubting Thomas, the third in his series Indian Journeys, will be shown on BBC2 on Monday at 7.10pm.</p>",

It is our fidelity to St Thomas that is most important to us.\" \u0095 William Dalrymple's film, Doubting Thomas, the third in his series Indian Journeys, will be shown on BBC2 on Monday at 7.10pm.",

In place of a puritan community dressed in God-fearing browns and greys, Tuckett and his designer Ralph Steadman have clothed the citizens of Salem in garish fancy dress, while the set features a crazed cartoon of a church set against neon-lit skies. Steadman's aim is to show the bedlam that overtakes Salem when it becomes gripped by terror of witchcraft and it chimes powerfully with the St Vitus madness which afflicts some of Tuckett's best choreography - the epileptic energy of its group dances and the mad menace of its processionals (all set to music by Charles Ives). Unfortunately, though, the visual concept creates a busyness on stage which becomes fatally chaotic when it is allied to the overambitious detail of Tuckett's storytelling. </p> <p>Even though he has compressed Miller's play into one act, Tuckett still tries to communicate too much of its incidental action. Scenes that aren't necessary to his own narrative are retained as the briefest of dance encounters. These not only baffle anyone who has not read the text, they obscure the mainspring of the ballet's action - the relationship between John and Elizabeth Procter and the manipulative Abigail. </p> <p>Tuckett actually paints this relationship vividly, contrasting the transparent, anguished emotion of Elizabeth's moves (Zenaida Yanowsky) with the sluttishbut queenly demeanour of Abigail (Sarah Wildor) and showing John (Irek Mukhamedov) moving with increasing desperation between them. If the triangle had been set up straight away, the rest of the complex story might have slotted into place around it. As it is, we have to figure it out as painfully as everything else. There's no question that Tuckett has considerable narrative gifts - the manic glitter of his priests, and the handwringing uncertainty of Elizabeth are evidence of a lively imagination. He just needs a good librettist to sort out his plot. </p> <p>The Crucible is part of an American-themed programme flanked by George Balanchine's Serenade (1934) and Jerome Robbins's The Concert (1956). Wednesday's performance of Serenade, led by a magisterial Darcey Bussell, was excellent, its New World spaciousness inflected with a distinctively British lyricism. The Concert was a hoot, with a fine cast led by Sylvie Guillem making her debut as a comedian. The ballet's jokes work only within a rigorously disciplined performance and the sight of Guillem's pristine technique being subjected to slapstick nonsense was extra- ordinary.

      "body": "<p>It is a telling cultural fact, the point at which certain words are let in the door of a language. When, I wonder, did the French break down and permit le weekend ? And how thick was the gloom at the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise when it happened? English is not, of course, a terribly exclusive club. A significant reason why it has become the world's de facto lingua franca is precisely its polyglot openmindednness - its very willingness to assimilate foreign elements (such as de facto or lingua franca) with more generosity than, say, Jack Straw. </p> <p>Still, there are bouncers deciding who can come in and who can not, and the most significant are those who watch over the Oxford English Dictionary. The OED is the last word on English; it calls itself, reasonably, the \"undisputed authority on the history and development of the English language\" and, with over a quarter of a million words defined and roughly half a million entries, has to be the most prolix and voluminous account of our maddeningly great tongue. </p> <p>A dear friend of mind, more techno-literate than I am, has told me of the virtues of owning the OED on CD-ROM. His own neat laptop glows with those quarter-million words, all humming away brightly on some mysterious chip of memory on his hard disc. Like a dumb girl, though, I had to be given a present before I would pay attention. His birthday offering to me was a logophile's delight: not the OED, but a book he had made himself of all the words recognised by the OED in the year of my birth. It is a brilliant idea, and the kind of trick only a computer's searching capacity could make possible. It is also a wonderfully revealing sketch of one year in the life of the language. </p> <p>The words fall into clusters of meaning that speak of the times. It was the 60s. With touching faith in the lasting imprint of the era, the good book took in slang words rat-fink and jive-ass (the latter, frankly, \"a word of fluid meaning and application\" ); passing fancies such as the frug, a \"modern dance\" that tends to appear in sentences next to the Watusi and is joined further on by its relation, the hully gully; and, surely in a prescient nod to Austin Powers, both Tom Jones (after the movie- \"a chiffon scarf in a Tom Jones bow\" , The Observer) and Carnaby Street, \"used allusively to refer to fashionable clothing for young people\" . </p> <p>Computers were beginning to make their mark, so you find the now quaint-seeming Basic, the early programming language, and byte, format and interfacing - the latter starting life as a fashion word, and ending up in computers. Science was continuing to change our perceptions of the world by giving us new words to describe it: the year saw in not just superhelix and quasar, but quark and its mate, anti-quark. Quark was nabbed from Finnegan's Wake by a physicist, and surely has the distinction of being the only science coinage that owes its existence to James Joyce. </p> <p>With a multicultural sensitivity that would make the Home Office proud, the OED welcomed a broad range of foreign words, from ska to yakuza , Umwelt to piri-piri . More dubiously, Strine was defined as \"the English language as (allegedly) spoken by Australians\" . And someone on the OED staff must have made a Jewish friend, as there's a heady onrush of Yiddish: two words I use all the time, kvetch and schlep , as well as schlub , heimisch , and a new one to me, schmegeggy - \"a contemptible person, an idiot\". Saul Bellow is frequently invoked here to provide a representative quotation. </p> <p> Elsewhere, Bellow lends another helping hand with a hostile instance of dikey. Not long before Stonewall, the OED had a year of some kind of lavender fever, accepting dikey, poofy and poncey. (Martin Amis: \"You haven't half got poncey mates,\" The Rachel Papers.) On the other hand, the OED in the same year had the fabulousness to recognise disco; first cited in Playboy (the OED is nothing if not catholic in its selection of sources), with the Guardian chipping in later, calling disco \"the most commercially successful new movement in pop music\". Fair enough: but that quotation is from 1979. </p> <p>A few words in my lovely blue book are the sort that are manifestly new, and yet that now seem completely folded into the language. Who can imagine life without sitcoms or in-jokes, or - god forbid - skateboards? </p> <p>My friend has created what seems to me a far more interesting cultural snapshot than those newspaper front pages that can be ordered for a birth date. Words make, for me, a more telling picture of \"where we were at\". So all that's left now is to pose the self-revealing question: what year was I born? </p> <p>\u0095 Sylvia Brownrigg is the author of The Metaphysical Touch, published by Phoenix.

      "bodyText": "It is a telling cultural fact, the point at which certain words are let in the door of a language. When, I wonder, did the French break down and permit le weekend ? And how thick was the gloom at the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise when it happened? English is not, of course, a terribly exclusive club. A significant reason why it has become the world's de facto lingua franca is precisely its polyglot openmindednness - its very willingness to assimilate foreign elements (such as de facto or lingua franca) with more generosity than, say, Jack Straw. Still, there are bouncers deciding who can come in and who can not, and the most significant are those who watch over the Oxford English Dictionary. The OED is the last word on English; it calls itself, reasonably, the \"undisputed authority on the history and development of the English language\" and, with over a quarter of a million words defined and roughly half a million entries, has to be the most prolix and voluminous account of our maddeningly great tongue. A dear friend of mind, more techno-literate than I am, has told me of the virtues of owning the OED on CD-ROM. His own neat laptop glows with those quarter-million words, all humming away brightly on some mysterious chip of memory on his hard disc. Like a dumb girl, though, I had to be given a present before I would pay attention. His birthday offering to me was a logophile's delight: not the OED, but a book he had made himself of all the words recognised by the OED in the year of my birth. It is a brilliant idea, and the kind of trick only a computer's searching capacity could make possible. It is also a wonderfully revealing sketch of one year in the life of the language. The words fall into clusters of meaning that speak of the times. It was the 60s. With touching faith in the lasting imprint of the era, the good book took in slang words rat-fink and jive-ass (the latter, frankly, \"a word of fluid meaning and application\" ); passing fancies such as the frug, a \"modern dance\" that tends to appear in sentences next to the Watusi and is joined further on by its relation, the hully gully; and, surely in a prescient nod to Austin Powers, both Tom Jones (after the movie- \"a chiffon scarf in a Tom Jones bow\" , The Observer) and Carnaby Street, \"used allusively to refer to fashionable clothing for young people\" . Computers were beginning to make their mark, so you find the now quaint-seeming Basic, the early programming language, and byte, format and interfacing - the latter starting life as a fashion word, and ending up in computers. Science was continuing to change our perceptions of the world by giving us new words to describe it: the year saw in not just superhelix and quasar, but quark and its mate, anti-quark. Quark was nabbed from Finnegan's Wake by a physicist, and surely has the distinction of being the only science coinage that owes its existence to James Joyce. With a multicultural sensitivity that would make the Home Office proud, the OED welcomed a broad range of foreign words, from ska to yakuza , Umwelt to piri-piri . More dubiously, Strine was defined as \"the English language as (allegedly) spoken by Australians\" . And someone on the OED staff must have made a Jewish friend, as there's a heady onrush of Yiddish: two words I use all the time, kvetch and schlep , as well as schlub , heimisch , and a new one to me, schmegeggy - \"a contemptible person, an idiot\". Saul Bellow is frequently invoked here to provide a representative quotation. Elsewhere, Bellow lends another helping hand with a hostile instance of dikey. Not long before Stonewall, the OED had a year of some kind of lavender fever, accepting dikey, poofy and poncey. (Martin Amis: \"You haven't half got poncey mates,\" The Rachel Papers.) On the other hand, the OED in the same year had the fabulousness to recognise disco; first cited in Playboy (the OED is nothing if not catholic in its selection of sources), with the Guardian chipping in later, calling disco \"the most commercially successful new movement in pop music\". Fair enough: but that quotation is from 1979. A few words in my lovely blue book are the sort that are manifestly new, and yet that now seem completely folded into the language. Who can imagine life without sitcoms or in-jokes, or - god forbid - skateboards? My friend has created what seems to me a far more interesting cultural snapshot than those newspaper front pages that can be ordered for a birth date. Words make, for me, a more telling picture of \"where we were at\". So all that's left now is to pose the self-revealing question: what year was I born? \u0095 Sylvia Brownrigg is the author of The Metaphysical Touch, published by Phoenix. Ian Mayes is away",

      "body": "<p>Lately, among Saul Bellow's keenest readers there had been somewhat emaciated expectations. It seemed that energy was fading. Bellow's first novel appeared in 1944, he had been writing for nearly 50 years, and it was perhaps time for his admirers to polish their gratitude for the earlier work and let things go. </p> <p>In 1995, Bellow was poisoned by eating toxic fish in the Caribbean, developed pneumonia, and very nearly died in a Boston hospital. When he at last recovered, he was not strong enough to sign a cheque, had no idea of the day or month. His nervous system had almost been erased by the poisons, and he needed months of primitive tuition to reclaim it. When he published a novella, The Actual, in 1996, it was a feat to have written it at all. Unsurprisingly, it seemed a mere ricochet from a talent that had already hit many targets; it had an interrupted energy. </p> <p>How extraordinary, then, that Bellow's substantial new novel, Ravelstein, written in his 85th year, should be so full of the old, cascading power, its prose displaying that august raciness one remembers from Herzog (1964) and Humboldt's Gift (1975), darting with metaphor and wit. The book's protagonist, Abe Ravelstein, is a lightly disguised portrait of Bellow's old friend, Allan Bloom, the conservative Chicago political theorist who became famous for his book The Closing Of The American Mind (1987). Indeed, it memorialises a larger intellectual community at the University of Chicago, and tells the story of Bloom's death from Aids, and of Bellow's dance with death five years ago. Most of the recent events in Bellow's life find their telling in this new book. </p> <p>But before one knows that,the novel's prose has to be reckoned with; it has an abundance and energy remarkable for a man his age, an overflowing quality that dissolves the book's biographical powders, and insists on its own autonomy. It tends to make irrelevant the usual questions of \"Who is X based on?\" </p> <p>Here are some of the many lustres to be found in Ravelstein. There is an angry cardiologist, who grips his stethoscope \"like a slingshot\". Or a man, seen with \"accordion pleats under his chin\". Or the neurologist who coaxes the poisoned Bellow-figure - the book's narrator - back from death, and is described thus: \"Dr Bax, like a skilful Indian scout of the last century, pressed his ear to the rail and heard the locomotive coming. Life would soon be back, and I would occupy my seat in the life-train. Death would shrink to its former place at the margin of the landscape.\" </p> <p>In these instances, one hears the sound of the Bellow of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. He once said that, in old age, he had so little energy that \"you have your foot to the floor but you are only going 20 miles an hour\". Of course, his own habitual recourse to metaphor, even in this instance, suggested otherwise, and his new book entirely contradicts his own fatalism. Recently, he joked, unconvincingly, that \"maybe one reason that I have so much energy is that I'm so lazy, really. I preserve my energies.\" </p> <p>At present, they are doubtless stretched, because in addition to the media-flummery of bringing out a new book, Bellow has recently become a father. His wife, Janis, gave birth to a daughter, Naomi Rose, at the end of last year. He has been much more involved in the child's early months than perhaps he expected to be. He plays the recorder to her (he is an accomplished musician), and sings the Volga Boat Song, and various Yiddish tunes. \"I'm the kid's personal troubador,\" he laughs. </p> <p>Janis Freedman, then a graduate student of Allan Bloom's, met Bellow 15 years ago, at the University of Chicago. Bellow was estranged from his fourth wife, Alexandra Ionesco Tulesca, a Romanian astro-phycisist. After marriages to Anita Goshikin, Alexandra Tschacbashov, Susan Glassman and Tulesca, and three sons, he has described himself as a serial husband, yet it is clear that in this fifth marriage an equilibrium and blessing has been found that he did not perhaps expect. He is aware of the rigidities in the writer's domestic life: and while no Tolstoy of matrimonial demand, has never hidden his past failings and impossibilities. In his new book, he pays a fine tribute to Janis, to her intelligence and beauty, and writes that the narrator and his wife understand each other. That is certainly the particular vibration the Bellows's marriage sounds. </p> <p>They have been living in Boston since 1994 - Janis teaches political theory at Boston University, and Bellow gives a statesman's course in the European novel - and their lives have a shapely, seasonal balance. In term time they write and teach, and entertain in their large, unlavish home in a Boston suburb; and in the long summer they decamp to Vermont, where they have a house built to Bellow's specifications (he can lie in the bath and study the stars through a skylight.) Until the Caribbean collapse, he rode a bike and swam in the local lake. They read Shakespeare out loud, sometimes auditioning village guests for other parts. </p> <p>Janis, in her early 40s, has a warm, shrewd, limitless quality, and a kind of wiry patience that suggests great reserves of strength.During his ordeal at the hospital in Boston she did not leave his room for 10 days, fearful that if she was absent even for a minute, he might die alone. Staff brought her infrequent meals. Bellow knows she saved his life, and continues to save it in some measure. It was touching, last year, to see the couple when Janis was very pregnant, the great gourd of her belly making mobility difficult, and her much older husband, differently frail, tender and solicitous on her behalf. They are unwarily loving in public: it is one of those marriages that seems entirely right, the provider of its own nutrients. </p> <p>Bellow seems unsurprised by, though grateful for, this late burst of creativity. But his biographer, James Atlas, rightly says that Ravelstein \"is an astonishing book, one of his strongest, and it comes, as you know, after a period of attenuation. Who are the other great writers who have done anything like this in their 80s? Tolstoy's late stories, I guess. Otherwise, I can only think of Thomas Mann, who created the character of Felix Krull, when he was, I think, 79.\" And Bellow's old friend, Keith Botsford, who with him edits an irregular literary journal called The Republic of Letters, admits that he is \"amazed. The power is there; it takes a little longer.\" </p> <p>Bellow himself seems chiefly concerned that readers will ignore the book's fictive qualities, and consider it only as a memoir of Allan Bloom. \"There is a strange literalism that's become a habit in America, \" he says. \"People only want the factual truth. Well, the truth is that Allan was a very superior person, great-souled. When people proclaim the death of the novel, I sometimes think they are really saying that there are no significant people to write about. Allan was certainly one. Yet I can't help being a fiction-writer. It's a curious process. Life is obviously feeding you, yet Ravelstein is a composite, taken from 100 different streams, like all of my characters.\" </p> <p>This seems true, for one finds oneself treating Ravelstein as if he simply joins the room of large Bellovian comic characters, like Moses Herzog, or Tommy Wilhelm in Seize The Day, or Uncle Benn Crader in More Die Of Heartbreak, or Victor Wulpy, in \"What Kind Of A Day Did You Have?\" (another powerful intellectual, yet one who \"wore his pants negligently,\" in Bellow's unforgettable phrase). </p> <p>Bellow is celebrated for his powers of physical portraiture, of grotesquerie, which tend to make all of his characters old, whatever their actual age: they are seniors in moral struggle. One of the comedies of this description is that while Bellow insists on our free agency as intelligences and souls, he gestures at the same time toward the physical imprisonment of our bodies. We are all victims, physically, all helpless account-keepers. That is why his heroes are so often bearish, large, fat-chested, panting, clumsy men - yet with delicate sensitivities. </p> <p>These men wear their moral age visibly, as a tree stump is ringed with years, and this in turn tells us something about Bellow's metaphysics. For he is not a psychologist, as novelists go. He does not go around unpicking his characters' selves, and truffling for motives. Instead, his people are embodied souls; they wear their stretched essences on their bodies, and it is Bellow's delight to, as it were, \"read\" their souls through their surfaces, as a Victorian phrenologist might read the skull. </p> <p>As in Dickens, Bellow's characters are flat, but they vibrate very strongly. The difference with Dickens, of course, is that Bellow writes often about intellectuals. Thus his people, paradoxically, are all mind and, simultaneously, all body. Typically, Ravelstein, in Bellovian mode, is large, flamboyant, and excessively clumsy. When he laughs, he throws his head back \"like Picasso's wounded horse in Guernica\". He loves fine clothes, Lanvin jackets, Zegna ties, but tends to spill food on them. Hostesses know to put newspaper underneath Ravelstein's chair at a dinner party. </p> <p>At home, he wanders around in an exquisite silk dressing-gown, chain-smoking. His apartment is stuffed with beautiful glass and silverware, with the finest Italian and French linens, and thousands of CDs. He reclines on a black leather couch, listening to Baroque music, is enormously learned, and given to oration on a thousand subjects. </p> <p>Though Bellow does not say it, Ravelstein has more than a touch of Proust's Charlus, the brilliant, snobbish homosexual who loudly lectures Marcel as they walk along the Parisian boulevards. (Bellow is a careful reader of Proust.) Or closer to home, Ravelstein is a more refined version, perhaps, of Simkin, the lawyer in Herzog, who \"liked to lie down on the black Naugahyde sofa in his office, cover himself with an afghan knitted by his mother, listening to Palestrina, Monteverdi, as he elaborated his legal and business strategies.\" </p> <p>Ravelstein has become rich and famous with a popular book which has distilled to ordinary readers his conservative analysis of American decline. Now in the summer of his fame and influence, he likes to keep in touch with his former students, several of whom are in the US government. He is a shambolic gossip; the novel's narrator mentions a colleague who liked to joke that \"when I gossip it isn't gossip but social history\". He is loyally attended to by his boyfriend, Nikki. By all accounts, including Bellow's, this is Allan Bloom as his friends knew him. </p> <p>Keith Botsford says that Bellow and Bloom, in addition to sharing a love of music, \"practised a kind of emotional shorthand together. Most of Saul's friendships have been like this. You have to be learned, to have read nearly everything, as he has done, and above all to enjoy it.\" Bloom, Botsford continues, \"was an irresistible figure, especially to a novelist, whatever one's opinion about his politics. I remember sitting in Allan's apartment, and as usual he was wearing his beautiful silk bathrobe, somewhat opened so that you could, um, admire what was inside, and he went to get some CD or other to play. He had a fantastic collection of CDs. As he stood at the wall, he passed a map of Jerusalem that was hanging on it. 'And that's a self-portrait,' he said, gesturing towards the map. That was the kind of life-force he was.\" </p> <p> Bellow and Bloom taught together at the University of Chicago in the 70s and 80s. The university, which has always been a bulwark of a Great Books approach to learning, was perhaps at the height of its influence. Its committee on social thought allowed novelists (like Bellow), classicists, economists, and philosophers to draft their own courses. Milton Friedman (Thatcher's economics guru), Edward Shills, the great scholar of comparative religion Mircea Eliade were all at Chicago at the same time. \"Chicago was a place that loved irregular people,\" says Bellow. \"Great scholars, most of them, but people with interesting streaks and histories.\" </p> <p>He has always been drawn to powerful intellects, in part because they offer an adequate match to his own powers, and also in part because their existence sanctions his own will-to-theory, his fondness for making use of speculation and scholarship in his fiction. Yet intellectuals are also a source of comedy because as scholars they are often labouring on quests for what is essential, but as private citizens their lives are full of the usual nonsense and superfluity. So their intellectual work seems to bring them no benefit, no relief, in domestic life. This is humblingly true of Moses Herzog, Bellow's most famous creation, a scholar of the Romantics who is undergoing a vicious divorce, and has taken to write zany letters of plaint in his head to famous people, dead and alive: to Churchill, Heidegger, Spinoza, Eisenhower. </p> <p>But more generally, Bellow's work has as its theme the struggle to find what is essential amidst the piles of our emotional slack, and amidst the heap of trivia and gratuity that is the contemporary world. Allan Bloom seems to fit this mould, a penetrating intellect who soiled his ties. But Bellow was obviously attracted by more. There was a political agreement between the two men, a feeling that America was refusing to talk honestly about its problems, and instead hiding them under wish-fulfilment or meaningless jargon. For both Bloom and Bellow, America, in its materialism, its violence, its shallowness, embodied \"nihilism without the abyss\". </p> <p>In his novel The Dean's December, written in 1982, his first after winning the Nobel Prize in 1976, Bellow contrasted prosperous, capitalist America with punitive, communist Romania. In the Communist world, there was \"hard nihilism\"; in America, there was \"soft nihilism\". Both dispensations incarnated a kind of cynicism about the possibilities of spiritual life. Bellow's complaint against America had been building since the 1960s, and The Dean's December, with its superb but unsettling descriptions of the Chicago ghettoes, was taken, by many, as a rancidly conservative book, even a racist one. </p> <p>Bellow describes The Dean's December as a \"cri de coeur. I disliked the fact that people wouldn't talk about this stuff honestly, particularly the state of the ghettoes, the inner-cities. But I don't know if anyone heard it.\" Five years later, he embossed his reputation as a neo-conservative by writing the introduction to Bloom's book, The Closing Of The American Mind, which wailed against the decline of the great universities, the destruction, as Bloom saw it, of the traditional literary canon, the sanctimonies of the left, the triumph of political correctness, and so on. </p> <p>Some found his endorsement of what seemed a rather mediocre conservative squeal a diminishment. There are probably some who feel that Bellow's new valedictory to Bloom is a further political fall. One of Bellow's friends, Robert Boyers, the editor of the literary and cultural journal Salmagundi, explains: \"Bellow rapidly became anathema to left-leaning liberal academics. That preface marked his separation from mainstream American academic life. But it has probably not affected his reputation as a writer: it's mostly in the realm of PR or politics.\" </p> <p>What, I ask Boyers, did Bellow find so attractive in Bloom? \"He liked the courage of going against the grain of so many ideas dearly held by the academic world. Bloom had written the book that Bellow might have written had he the appetite to do it.\" </p> <p>Yet Bellow's preface is not espe cially political. Instead, it is largely an insistence, congruent with all his work, that the self should not be defined politically, nor even intellectually. Bloom, who was able to escape his clumsy body and his undistinguished origins by the power of mind, was probably attractive to Bellow because he was an example of the way the self flies beyond the nets that society wants to throw over it. </p> <p>This liberation had an urgency at a time when, more strongly perhaps than now, academics and theorists were herding people into their ethnicities, sleeving them in racial and political data, arguing that we are always the ideology that speaks us, not the voice that sings over ideology. Singularity - if one wanted a word to define Bellow's ambitions for the self it would be this. In many ways, he is an Emersonian individualist. Moses Herzog recalls being a class orator at school, and reciting from Emerson: \"The private life of one man shall be a more illustrious monarchy than any kingdom in history.\" This Emersonianism is then crossed with Russian and Jewish influences. It is hard not to hear Bellow in Martin Buber, when Buber writes that \"the uniqueness of man proves himself in his life with others. For the more unique a man really is, so much the more can he give to the other.\" </p> <p>Bellow's characters, especially his intellectuals, are people, like him, who grew up in straitened circumstances and discovered the expansions of thought in books, and then felt free to roam wherever they liked. He is something of a zealot for the freedoms of the soul. One of the more provocative contradictions of Bellow's enterprise is that he has been a late-modern novelist, writing in the age of Beckett and Bernhard (Beckett read Bellow with pleasure, and the two met once in Paris), who has yet prolonged the soul-pungency of the great 19th-century Russian novelists. He is most like Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky in his determination to deliver his characters from the inessential. </p> <p>Of course, Bellow was nearly born in St. Petersburg, as Saul Belov. His family emigrated from Russia to Quebec, where he was born in 1915. But they moved to America, and he grew up in Chicago, \"clumsy, tender, stinking Chicago, dumped on its ancient lake bottom\". Chicago, as he has often said, was a fine place for a boy like him to educate himself. He took nourishment from the great books in the public libraries. In addition, traders came by with cheap editions of new work. \"You could get freethinkers like TH Huxley, along with Tolstoy's Confession, and selections from Hegel. It was a comprehensive education,\" says Bellow. </p> <p>And there was a thriving sensory world, of course. There were Jews and Poles, Germans, Italians and Russians, and Bellow was a keen observer. Much of this early life finds its way into the big novels like The Adventures Of Augie March, Herzog, and Humboldt's Gift. Moses Herzog recalls receiving packets of worthless roubles from Grandfather Herzog, still in Russia. \"You held the glorious bills to the light and you saw Peter the Great and Catherine in the watermarked rainbow paper.\" This was almost certainly a family memory or story. </p> <p>Bellow has been associated with Bloom, and with neo-conservatism, for over a decade now. He jokes that \"Allan had very serious enemies, and I came in for my share - a kind of agent's percentage cut.\" But Bellow's sense of the world is finally religious, rather than political, and in this regard his new novel joins arms with his earliest work. Occasionally, one senses a tension between the Bellovian narrator and his metaphysical, even mystical impulses, and Ravelstein's atheist-materialism. </p> <p>Bellow's new book is ghosted by death. His locomotive has raced past the death-sidings, full of friends like John Berryman, John Cheever, Ralph Ellison. One sometimes forgets that Bellow belongs to Robert Lowell's generation - Lowell, who died in 1977. He has been not only the greater writer than any of them, but the more steadily persistent. Allan Bloom's death perhaps seemed like a warning: Bellow next. He writes, in Ravelstein, of Chicago (though the city is unnamed): \"On every one of the surrounding streets there were front rooms where friends had lived - and at the sides, the windows of bedrooms where they died... It was collection time for an entire generation.\" </p> <p>Partly to soften hard memories, the Bellows moved to Boston in 1994. I first met him, one of the few living writers I admired as I admired the august dead, 10 years ago, in Chicago. In his mid-70s then, he was vigorous, commanding, and planted solidly on his home turf: he offered to drive me around, and introduce me to his \"contacts\" - the dry-cleaners, hotel-managers, policemen and local politicians who fund his fictional version of Chicago. </p> <p>I met him again in 1996, not long after the Caribbean collapse, in Boston, and he was not strong enough to lift the salad-bowl. A gate had closed, one thought. Surely Bellow's style, so obviously indexed to his energy, a kind of intellectual virility, really, had died, too, was now as weak as the hand that had been so easily vanquished by the little salad-bowl, with its burden of greens. He had an old man's impatience at this dinner party, stiffly drumming his vine-like fingers, and eager for his bed. </p> <p>In the past few years I have been lucky enough to witness Bellow's renovation, sometimes in Washington, more often in Boston. At times he seems weary or withdrawn, but more often one is struck by how intellectually speedy is his mind, still throwing out Bellovian enticements. </p> <p>What is Bellovian? At a restaurant last year, a pompous dessert was served. The chef had placed little dots of red coulis around the rims of the bowls, each dot geometrically exact. It seemed that someone had measured the gap between each blob. \"Euclidean pimples!\" Bellow said, raised his head, and offered his jointed, sluggish laugh. </p> <p>When one thinks of a phrase from Bellow, it almost always has this kind of wit, and of course it is a metaphysical wit in the way that Donne or Shakespeare is: a metaphorical liveliness, yoking together apparent incompatibles. There is Valentine Gersbach, in Herzog, with his wooden leg, \"gracefully bending and straightening like a gondolier,\" or Mason, the young thug in The Dean's December, whom \"you had to study to find the humanity in. It was like looking for the mercury in a thermometer.\" </p> <p>It is not surprising that Joyce is one of Bellow's great pleasures, nor that he owns one of the Shakespeare and Company's editions of Ulysses, with the Parisian typesetter's errors. \"It was smuggled into America by a schoolfriend of mine.\" In Joycean style, Bellow loves puns and wordgames. One of his jokes, which gets into Ravelstein, is to turn the Jermyn Street shirtmaker, Turnbull and Asser, into \"Kisser and Asser\". And this is not mere play, because it also contains a worldly judgment about Jews dressing as goys, kissing the gentile ass, as it were. </p> <p>Bellow is a worldly mystic. His prose logs impressions with broken speed; his metaphysical engine then grinds through these images for what is essential. In Herzog, Moses is seen pausing on \"the metal doors of the sidewalk elevator,\" and receiving \"the raised pattern of the steel door through his thin shoes; like Braille. But he did not interpret a message.\" It could be said that the world presses on Bellow's characters like Braille for those who do not need it. Reality is both a code and a distraction, and the task is to sort out the necessary from the superfluous. </p> <p>For all that Bellow may be seen by some as a conservative, he has been constantly hospitable to American modernity, especially to the tumult of the city. He says that \"America contains all human types\", and it is true of his books. It is this wordliness that allows him to be, as a stylist, both an aesthete and a pounding realist, so that he is very exquisite without being precious. He truly writes prose, but prose written at least as well as verse, and it is doubtless this combination of the worldly and the lyrical that has been such an influence not only on Philip Roth and Don DeLillo, but on the most interesting stylists in Britain, like McEwan, Amis, Rushdie. </p> <p>And at 85, astoundingly, he is still writing. One thinks of Henry James on his deathbed, the writing hand still moving involuntarily. Bellow will write to the end, no doubt, harnessed to the novel, that form he has sharpened again and again since the early 1940s. His biographer, James Atlas, says: \"He used to say when he was in his 70s, 'I'm not ready to be summed up yet', and I thought, privately, 'Yeah, yeah.' But you know what? It turns out he's right.\" </p> <p><strong>Life at a glance: Saul Bellow </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> June 10 1915, Lachine, Quebec, Canada. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> University of Chicago 1933-95, Northwestern University 1937, BS. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> Anita Goshkin (one son), divorced; 1956 Alexandra Tschacbasov (one son), divorced; 1961 Susan Glassman (one son), divorced; 1974 Alexandra Ionesco Tuleca, divorced; 1989 Janis Freedman (one daughter, 1999). </p> <p><strong> Employment:</strong> Instructor, Pestalozzi-Froebel teachers college, Chicago, 1938-42; Encyclopedia Britannica 1943-46; University of Minnesota 1946-49; various teaching posts in USA and England 1950-. </p> <p><strong> Some novels:</strong> Dangling Man 1944: The Adventures Of Augie March 1953; Herzog 1964; Humboldt's Gift 1975; The Dean's December 1982; More Die Of Heartbreak 1986; A Theft 1989. </p> <p><strong> Awards:</strong> Nobel literature prize 1976. </p> <p>\u0095 Ravelstein is published by Viking on April 27 price \u00a316.99.

      "bodyText": "Lately, among Saul Bellow's keenest readers there had been somewhat emaciated expectations. It seemed that energy was fading. Bellow's first novel appeared in 1944, he had been writing for nearly 50 years, and it was perhaps time for his admirers to polish their gratitude for the earlier work and let things go. In 1995, Bellow was poisoned by eating toxic fish in the Caribbean, developed pneumonia, and very nearly died in a Boston hospital. When he at last recovered, he was not strong enough to sign a cheque, had no idea of the day or month. His nervous system had almost been erased by the poisons, and he needed months of primitive tuition to reclaim it. When he published a novella, The Actual, in 1996, it was a feat to have written it at all. Unsurprisingly, it seemed a mere ricochet from a talent that had already hit many targets; it had an interrupted energy. How extraordinary, then, that Bellow's substantial new novel, Ravelstein, written in his 85th year, should be so full of the old, cascading power, its prose displaying that august raciness one remembers from Herzog (1964) and Humboldt's Gift (1975), darting with metaphor and wit. The book's protagonist, Abe Ravelstein, is a lightly disguised portrait of Bellow's old friend, Allan Bloom, the conservative Chicago political theorist who became famous for his book The Closing Of The American Mind (1987). Indeed, it memorialises a larger intellectual community at the University of Chicago, and tells the story of Bloom's death from Aids, and of Bellow's dance with death five years ago. Most of the recent events in Bellow's life find their telling in this new book. But before one knows that,the novel's prose has to be reckoned with; it has an abundance and energy remarkable for a man his age, an overflowing quality that dissolves the book's biographical powders, and insists on its own autonomy. It tends to make irrelevant the usual questions of \"Who is X based on?\" Here are some of the many lustres to be found in Ravelstein. There is an angry cardiologist, who grips his stethoscope \"like a slingshot\". Or a man, seen with \"accordion pleats under his chin\". Or the neurologist who coaxes the poisoned Bellow-figure - the book's narrator - back from death, and is described thus: \"Dr Bax, like a skilful Indian scout of the last century, pressed his ear to the rail and heard the locomotive coming. Life would soon be back, and I would occupy my seat in the life-train. Death would shrink to its former place at the margin of the landscape.\" In these instances, one hears the sound of the Bellow of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. He once said that, in old age, he had so little energy that \"you have your foot to the floor but you are only going 20 miles an hour\". Of course, his own habitual recourse to metaphor, even in this instance, suggested otherwise, and his new book entirely contradicts his own fatalism. Recently, he joked, unconvincingly, that \"maybe one reason that I have so much energy is that I'm so lazy, really. I preserve my energies.\" At present, they are doubtless stretched, because in addition to the media-flummery of bringing out a new book, Bellow has recently become a father. His wife, Janis, gave birth to a daughter, Naomi Rose, at the end of last year. He has been much more involved in the child's early months than perhaps he expected to be. He plays the recorder to her (he is an accomplished musician), and sings the Volga Boat Song, and various Yiddish tunes. \"I'm the kid's personal troubador,\" he laughs. Janis Freedman, then a graduate student of Allan Bloom's, met Bellow 15 years ago, at the University of Chicago. Bellow was estranged from his fourth wife, Alexandra Ionesco Tulesca, a Romanian astro-phycisist. After marriages to Anita Goshikin, Alexandra Tschacbashov, Susan Glassman and Tulesca, and three sons, he has described himself as a serial husband, yet it is clear that in this fifth marriage an equilibrium and blessing has been found that he did not perhaps expect. He is aware of the rigidities in the writer's domestic life: and while no Tolstoy of matrimonial demand, has never hidden his past failings and impossibilities. In his new book, he pays a fine tribute to Janis, to her intelligence and beauty, and writes that the narrator and his wife understand each other. That is certainly the particular vibration the Bellows's marriage sounds. They have been living in Boston since 1994 - Janis teaches political theory at Boston University, and Bellow gives a statesman's course in the European novel - and their lives have a shapely, seasonal balance. In term time they write and teach, and entertain in their large, unlavish home in a Boston suburb; and in the long summer they decamp to Vermont, where they have a house built to Bellow's specifications (he can lie in the bath and study the stars through a skylight.) Until the Caribbean collapse, he rode a bike and swam in the local lake. They read Shakespeare out loud, sometimes auditioning village guests for other parts. Janis, in her early 40s, has a warm, shrewd, limitless quality, and a kind of wiry patience that suggests great reserves of strength.During his ordeal at the hospital in Boston she did not leave his room for 10 days, fearful that if she was absent even for a minute, he might die alone. Staff brought her infrequent meals. Bellow knows she saved his life, and continues to save it in some measure. It was touching, last year, to see the couple when Janis was very pregnant, the great gourd of her belly making mobility difficult, and her much older husband, differently frail, tender and solicitous on her behalf. They are unwarily loving in public: it is one of those marriages that seems entirely right, the provider of its own nutrients. Bellow seems unsurprised by, though grateful for, this late burst of creativity. But his biographer, James Atlas, rightly says that Ravelstein \"is an astonishing book, one of his strongest, and it comes, as you know, after a period of attenuation. Who are the other great writers who have done anything like this in their 80s? Tolstoy's late stories, I guess. Otherwise, I can only think of Thomas Mann, who created the character of Felix Krull, when he was, I think, 79.\" And Bellow's old friend, Keith Botsford, who with him edits an irregular literary journal called The Republic of Letters, admits that he is \"amazed. The power is there; it takes a little longer.\" Bellow himself seems chiefly concerned that readers will ignore the book's fictive qualities, and consider it only as a memoir of Allan Bloom. \"There is a strange literalism that's become a habit in America, \" he says. \"People only want the factual truth. Well, the truth is that Allan was a very superior person, great-souled. When people proclaim the death of the novel, I sometimes think they are really saying that there are no significant people to write about. Allan was certainly one. Yet I can't help being a fiction-writer. It's a curious process. Life is obviously feeding you, yet Ravelstein is a composite, taken from 100 different streams, like all of my characters.\" This seems true, for one finds oneself treating Ravelstein as if he simply joins the room of large Bellovian comic characters, like Moses Herzog, or Tommy Wilhelm in Seize The Day, or Uncle Benn Crader in More Die Of Heartbreak, or Victor Wulpy, in \"What Kind Of A Day Did You Have?\" (another powerful intellectual, yet one who \"wore his pants negligently,\" in Bellow's unforgettable phrase). Bellow is celebrated for his powers of physical portraiture, of grotesquerie, which tend to make all of his characters old, whatever their actual age: they are seniors in moral struggle. One of the comedies of this description is that while Bellow insists on our free agency as intelligences and souls, he gestures at the same time toward the physical imprisonment of our bodies. We are all victims, physically, all helpless account-keepers. That is why his heroes are so often bearish, large, fat-chested, panting, clumsy men - yet with delicate sensitivities. These men wear their moral age visibly, as a tree stump is ringed with years, and this in turn tells us something about Bellow's metaphysics. For he is not a psychologist, as novelists go. He does not go around unpicking his characters' selves, and truffling for motives. Instead, his people are embodied souls; they wear their stretched essences on their bodies, and it is Bellow's delight to, as it were, \"read\" their souls through their surfaces, as a Victorian phrenologist might read the skull. As in Dickens, Bellow's characters are flat, but they vibrate very strongly. The difference with Dickens, of course, is that Bellow writes often about intellectuals. Thus his people, paradoxically, are all mind and, simultaneously, all body. Typically, Ravelstein, in Bellovian mode, is large, flamboyant, and excessively clumsy. When he laughs, he throws his head back \"like Picasso's wounded horse in Guernica\". He loves fine clothes, Lanvin jackets, Zegna ties, but tends to spill food on them. Hostesses know to put newspaper underneath Ravelstein's chair at a dinner party. At home, he wanders around in an exquisite silk dressing-gown, chain-smoking. His apartment is stuffed with beautiful glass and silverware, with the finest Italian and French linens, and thousands of CDs. He reclines on a black leather couch, listening to Baroque music, is enormously learned, and given to oration on a thousand subjects. Though Bellow does not say it, Ravelstein has more than a touch of Proust's Charlus, the brilliant, snobbish homosexual who loudly lectures Marcel as they walk along the Parisian boulevards. (Bellow is a careful reader of Proust.) Or closer to home, Ravelstein is a more refined version, perhaps, of Simkin, the lawyer in Herzog, who \"liked to lie down on the black Naugahyde sofa in his office, cover himself with an afghan knitted by his mother, listening to Palestrina, Monteverdi, as he elaborated his legal and business strategies.\" Ravelstein has become rich and famous with a popular book which has distilled to ordinary readers his conservative analysis of American decline. Now in the summer of his fame and influence, he likes to keep in touch with his former students, several of whom are in the US government. He is a shambolic gossip; the novel's narrator mentions a colleague who liked to joke that \"when I gossip it isn't gossip but social history\". He is loyally attended to by his boyfriend, Nikki. By all accounts, including Bellow's, this is Allan Bloom as his friends knew him. Keith Botsford says that Bellow and Bloom, in addition to sharing a love of music, \"practised a kind of emotional shorthand together. Most of Saul's friendships have been like this. You have to be learned, to have read nearly everything, as he has done, and above all to enjoy it.\" Bloom, Botsford continues, \"was an irresistible figure, especially to a novelist, whatever one's opinion about his politics. I remember sitting in Allan's apartment, and as usual he was wearing his beautiful silk bathrobe, somewhat opened so that you could, um, admire what was inside, and he went to get some CD or other to play. He had a fantastic collection of CDs. As he stood at the wall, he passed a map of Jerusalem that was hanging on it. 'And that's a self-portrait,' he said, gesturing towards the map. That was the kind of life-force he was.\" Bellow and Bloom taught together at the University of Chicago in the 70s and 80s. The university, which has always been a bulwark of a Great Books approach to learning, was perhaps at the height of its influence. Its committee on social thought allowed novelists (like Bellow), classicists, economists, and philosophers to draft their own courses. Milton Friedman (Thatcher's economics guru), Edward Shills, the great scholar of comparative religion Mircea Eliade were all at Chicago at the same time. \"Chicago was a place that loved irregular people,\" says Bellow. \"Great scholars, most of them, but people with interesting streaks and histories.\" He has always been drawn to powerful intellects, in part because they offer an adequate match to his own powers, and also in part because their existence sanctions his own will-to-theory, his fondness for making use of speculation and scholarship in his fiction. Yet intellectuals are also a source of comedy because as scholars they are often labouring on quests for what is essential, but as private citizens their lives are full of the usual nonsense and superfluity. So their intellectual work seems to bring them no benefit, no relief, in domestic life. This is humblingly true of Moses Herzog, Bellow's most famous creation, a scholar of the Romantics who is undergoing a vicious divorce, and has taken to write zany letters of plaint in his head to famous people, dead and alive: to Churchill, Heidegger, Spinoza, Eisenhower. But more generally, Bellow's work has as its theme the struggle to find what is essential amidst the piles of our emotional slack, and amidst the heap of trivia and gratuity that is the contemporary world. Allan Bloom seems to fit this mould, a penetrating intellect who soiled his ties. But Bellow was obviously attracted by more. There was a political agreement between the two men, a feeling that America was refusing to talk honestly about its problems, and instead hiding them under wish-fulfilment or meaningless jargon. For both Bloom and Bellow, America, in its materialism, its violence, its shallowness, embodied \"nihilism without the abyss\".

Instead, it is largely an insistence, congruent with all his work, that the self should not be defined politically, nor even intellectually. Bloom, who was able to escape his clumsy body and his undistinguished origins by the power of mind, was probably attractive to Bellow because he was an example of the way the self flies beyond the nets that society wants to throw over it. This liberation had an urgency at a time when, more strongly perhaps than now, academics and theorists were herding people into their ethnicities, sleeving them in racial and political data, arguing that we are always the ideology that speaks us, not the voice that sings over ideology. Singularity - if one wanted a word to define Bellow's ambitions for the self it would be this. In many ways, he is an Emersonian individualist.

His family emigrated from Russia to Quebec, where he was born in 1915. But they moved to America, and he grew up in Chicago, \"clumsy, tender, stinking Chicago, dumped on its ancient lake bottom\". Chicago, as he has often said, was a fine place for a boy like him to educate himself. He took nourishment from the great books in the public libraries. In addition, traders came by with cheap editions of new work. \"You could get freethinkers like TH Huxley, along with Tolstoy's Confession, and selections from Hegel. It was a comprehensive education,\" says Bellow. And there was a thriving sensory world, of course. There were Jews and Poles, Germans, Italians and Russians, and Bellow was a keen observer. Much of this early life finds its way into the big novels like The Adventures Of Augie March, Herzog, and Humboldt's Gift. Moses Herzog recalls receiving packets of worthless roubles from Grandfather Herzog, still in Russia. \"You held the glorious bills to the light and you saw Peter the Great and Catherine in the watermarked rainbow paper.\" This was almost certainly a family memory or story. Bellow has been associated with Bloom, and with neo-conservatism, for over a decade now. He jokes that \"Allan had very serious enemies, and I came in for my share - a kind of agent's percentage cut.\" But Bellow's sense of the world is finally religious, rather than political, and in this regard his new novel joins arms with his earliest work. Occasionally, one senses a tension between the Bellovian narrator and his metaphysical, even mystical impulses, and Ravelstein's atheist-materialism. Bellow's new book is ghosted by death. His locomotive has raced past the death-sidings, full of friends like John Berryman, John Cheever, Ralph Ellison. One sometimes forgets that Bellow belongs to Robert Lowell's generation - Lowell, who died in 1977. He has been not only the greater writer than any of them, but the more steadily persistent. Allan Bloom's death perhaps seemed like a warning: Bellow next. He writes, in Ravelstein, of Chicago (though the city is unnamed): \"On every one of the surrounding streets there were front rooms where friends had lived - and at the sides, the windows of bedrooms where they died... It was collection time for an entire generation.\" Partly to soften hard memories, the Bellows moved to Boston in 1994. I first met him, one of the few living writers I admired as I admired the august dead, 10 years ago, in Chicago. In his mid-70s then, he was vigorous, commanding, and planted solidly on his home turf: he offered to drive me around, and introduce me to his \"contacts\" - the dry-cleaners, hotel-managers, policemen and local politicians who fund his fictional version of Chicago. I met him again in 1996, not long after the Caribbean collapse, in Boston, and he was not strong enough to lift the salad-bowl. A gate had closed, one thought. Surely Bellow's style, so obviously indexed to his energy, a kind of intellectual virility, really, had died, too, was now as weak as the hand that had been so easily vanquished by the little salad-bowl, with its burden of greens. He had an old man's impatience at this dinner party, stiffly drumming his vine-like fingers, and eager for his bed. In the past few years I have been lucky enough to witness Bellow's renovation, sometimes in Washington, more often in Boston. At times he seems weary or withdrawn, but more often one is struck by how intellectually speedy is his mind, still throwing out Bellovian enticements. What is Bellovian? At a restaurant last year, a pompous dessert was served. The chef had placed little dots of red coulis around the rims of the bowls, each dot geometrically exact. It seemed that someone had measured the gap between each blob. \"Euclidean pimples!\" Bellow said, raised his head, and offered his jointed, sluggish laugh. When one thinks of a phrase from Bellow, it almost always has this kind of wit, and of course it is a metaphysical wit in the way that Donne or Shakespeare is: a metaphorical liveliness, yoking together apparent incompatibles. There is Valentine Gersbach, in Herzog, with his wooden leg, \"gracefully bending and straightening like a gondolier,\" or Mason, the young thug in The Dean's December, whom \"you had to study to find the humanity in. It was like looking for the mercury in a thermometer.\" It is not surprising that Joyce is one of Bellow's great pleasures, nor that he owns one of the Shakespeare and Company's editions of Ulysses, with the Parisian typesetter's errors. \"It was smuggled into America by a schoolfriend of mine.\" In Joycean style, Bellow loves puns and wordgames. One of his jokes, which gets into Ravelstein, is to turn the Jermyn Street shirtmaker, Turnbull and Asser, into \"Kisser and Asser\". And this is not mere play, because it also contains a worldly judgment about Jews dressing as goys, kissing the gentile ass, as it were. Bellow is a worldly mystic. His prose logs impressions with broken speed; his metaphysical engine then grinds through these images for what is essential. In Herzog, Moses is seen pausing on \"the metal doors of the sidewalk elevator,\" and receiving \"the raised pattern of the steel door through his thin shoes; like Braille. But he did not interpret a message.\" It could be said that the world presses on Bellow's characters like Braille for those who do not need it. Reality is both a code and a distraction, and the task is to sort out the necessary from the superfluous. For all that Bellow may be seen by some as a conservative, he has been constantly hospitable to American modernity, especially to the tumult of the city. He says that \"America contains all human types\", and it is true of his books. It is this wordliness that allows him to be, as a stylist, both an aesthete and a pounding realist, so that he is very exquisite without being precious. He truly writes prose, but prose written at least as well as verse, and it is doubtless this combination of the worldly and the lyrical that has been such an influence not only on Philip Roth and Don DeLillo, but on the most interesting stylists in Britain, like McEwan, Amis, Rushdie. And at 85, astoundingly, he is still writing. One thinks of Henry James on his deathbed, the writing hand still moving involuntarily. Bellow will write to the end, no doubt, harnessed to the novel, that form he has sharpened again and again since the early 1940s. His biographer, James Atlas, says: \"He used to say when he was in his 70s, 'I'm not ready to be summed up yet', and I thought, privately, 'Yeah, yeah.' But you know what? It turns out he's right.\" Life at a glance: Saul Bellow Born: June 10 1915, Lachine, Quebec, Canada. Education: University of Chicago 1933-95, Northwestern University 1937, BS.

Fiennes has to use expressive body language and an extensive vocal palette to get his points across: West can afford to be quietly sardonic. But what fascinates me is how both strenuously avoid lyricism and sympathy. Richard always used to be seen as irresponsible in the first half and elegiac in the second. But such is our modern cynicism about kingship that neither actor craves our indulgence. You can't help but feel for the deposed, humiliated Richard. But both Fiennes and West imply that Shakespeare's hero is as much imprisoned by monarchy as by literal incarceration. </p> <p>The real difference, however, lies in the directors' approaches to the play. For Kent, politics seem marginal: for Pimlott, you feel, they are the main reason for doing the work. And what hit me like a thunderclap is that the real key to Richard II lies in how you interpret Bolingbroke: the man who seizes the throne. In the old days you cast your smooth actor as Richard, your hairy one as Bolingbroke. It was John Barton who shattered the stereotype in 1973 by having Ian Richardson and Richard Pasco alternate the two roles - suddenly they became a mirror image of each other. Deborah Warner picked up on the idea in her 90s National Theatre production by suggesting a strange sibling kinship between Fiona Shaw's Richard and David Threlfall's usurper. </p> <p>What is clear is that both are awoken to the isolation and fragility of power. Richard is unseated by Bolingbroke - the latter discovers that illegality opens the door to rebellion. But Pimlott takes this much further. West's Richard is a heedless tyrant, David Troughton's Bolingbroke is a purposeful one. What both have is the absolutist's ability to hide behind the sanctity of God and nationhood. In the Westminster deposition scene West, quite literally, wraps himself in the national flag. Troughton meanwhile, appealing to a divine right he himself has shattered, at one point asks the audience to rise in prayer. This brilliantly pins down the tendency of dictators, and even democratic politicians, to cloak themselves in convenient abstractions - a point Pinter has tirelessly made in his recent political plays. </p> <p>Shakespeare's history plays are not just about the Tudor myth: they are actually about the daily practice of power. In that sense, they are the greatest political plays ever written. What you can't do today is ignore their ramifications. I would not claim Kent does that at Shoreditch. He reflects our scepticism about monarchy, and in David Burke's John of Gaunt and Oliver Ford Davies's Duke of York he depicts the extremes of passion and vacillation. </p> <p>But his failure lies in leaving Bolingbroke an enigma. What on earth is Linus Roache up to? Is he suggesting Bolingbroke returns from exile simply to claim his lands? Or does his quietude imply he is a crafty opportunist hoping the crown will fall into his lap? The fact is we simply never know. Having gained power, this Bolingbroke also never seems to exercise it. He casually condemns Richard's favourites to death. Troughton personally puts a bullet through their brains. </p> <p>Audiences, I suspect, are drawn to Richard II by the prospect of a star performance - they certainly get that in spades from the richly expressive Fiennes. The reality is, however, that it is Bolingbroke who motors the play from the initial appeal against Mowbray to the final remorse over Richard's death. Put Bolingbroke at the centre, as they do at Stratford, and you have a profoundly political work. Make Richard the spotlit focus, as they do in Shoreditch, and you have the lesser form of tragedy. </p> <p>\u0095 Jonathan Kent's Richard II is at the Gainsborough Studios, London N1 (0171-359 4404), till May 20.

How come?\" She would have to think about it. Pilgrims and tourists have poured in since then. Sunshine and Easter ceremonies have doubled the number of visitors to more than 2m a month. They pass through Fiumicino airport's new extension, hop on trains and arrive at a bright and airy Termini. Beyond lies a city gleaming with restored monuments. Last week at Termini, a woman wearing blue jeans, a yellow shirt and a hair ribbon waved as I passed. Mary. She smiled, showing perfect teeth, and marvelled at the sunshine. Her eyes were clear and her skin smooth. Winter was a memory and she was happy. The shelters found her a home? \"Nah, I never went. I didn't have anywhere to leave my stuff. I'm still here.\" She pointed to her sports bags beneath a bench. \"It's not so bad. I watch the tourists coming, I've got friends, it's warm.\" Her voice lowered. \"I've met someone. We're together now.\" Mary was in love. It may not last, she still craves wine, and winter will return. But Mary has rediscovered human companionship, another theme of the jubilee. And for now at least, she feels part of it.",

Although the report was written at the behest of the European commission, it was drawn up by a Danish firm which pledges that its findings are entirely \"objective and independent\". The commission, while careful not to be seen to be pleading poverty, said the report shattered the myth of overpaid EU officials. \"The report shows that some of the exaggerated stories banded about describing overpaid Eurocrats wallowing in tax-free allowances are just not true,\" one source said. \"There are plenty of people in comparable jobs who earn just as much, contrary to what some would have you believe.\" The report shows that a top commission official without dependants takes home about \u00a378,000 a year after tax. This is about the same as officials earn in organisations such as Nato and the United Nations. However, their counterparts at a large multinational corporation can expect to make just over \u00a3100,000 a year. If an official is married and has children there are special allowances which inflate these figures - but the equivalent private sector job still pays better. \"We're not making out that we're poor or badly paid\", another official said, \"but we do need a measure of objectivity in this debate.\" He added: \"There are people in several high-profile departments who could leave the commission tomorrow and double their salaries.\" The report does show that EU functionaries do considerably better than civil servants in most member-state countries, often raking in twice as much as their national counterparts do.

      "bodyText": "Two former cabinet ministers in the South Pacific islands of Samoa have been sentenced to death for plotting the assassination of a political rival, a plot of intrigue and jealousy worthy of the short stories Somerset Maugham wrote around the steamy Samoan capital, Apia. Justice Andrew Wilson of the supreme court upheld the jury's four to one verdict that the former women's affairs minister Leafa Vitale, 57, and the former communications minister Toi Aukuso, 68, were guilty of planning the murder of their colleague, Luagalau Levaula Kamu. Death by hanging is the mandatory sentence for murder in Samoa, but has never been carried out since the former German and New Zealand territory, which is still largely ruled by chiefs with traditional powers, became independent in 1961. Kamu was shot in the back while he spoke into his mobile telephone during a political gathering on July 16 last year. Vitale's son Alatise, 34, was convicted at an earlier hearing of shooting him with an M16. Alatise's death sentence was, as is customary, commuted to life imprisonment. Kamu was a popular younger politician who was trying to clean up the incestuous and often corrupt nature of Samoan public life. His murder was seen as an attempt to prevent publication of reports on corruption which were believed to implicate former ministers and MPs. The prosecution also alleged that Vitale and Aukuso had him killed out of jealousy, because he had been appointed minister of public works, a job whose holder was known to receive bribes from local companies competing for government funded contracts. The trial, which began in Apia on January 17, heard from 65 witnesses, including Alatise, who testified that his father and Aukuso ordered him to carry out the killing. Vitale denied ordering the murder and described Kamu as a \"very good friend\". Aukuso testified that Vitale asked him to shoot Kamu and the prime minister, Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, but that he refused after Vitale failed to pay him as promised. Kamu's widow, Maiava Visekota Peteru, asked for clemency, saying outside the court that she did not support capital punishment. The trial shocked the strongly Christian Samoan population of about 164,000.",

      "body": "<p>A report showing that six of the world's seven species of marine turtles are still in danger of extinction was presented to delegates of 140 countries in Nairobi yesterday. It makes a strong case for continuing the international ban on trade in turtle products. </p> <p>The delegates are attending the 11th Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which is considering an application from Cuba and Dominica to reopen the trade in tortoiseshell. The shells are bought by Japan, where expert craftsmen turn them into jewellery. </p> <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), which is involved in many international schemes to save the turtle, says that despite some successful interventions to protect breeding grounds, all the species are still endangered including the hawksbill which Cuba particularly wants to trade. Turtles are still much in demand worldwide to be stuffed, varnished and mounted. The shells are sold openly to tourists in Vietnam, Cambodia and the Caribbean, despite the international ban. </p> <p>Although tourists carrying such trophies back to Britain will have them confiscated by customs, the WWF does not believe that international policing efforts are good enough elsewhere. If the ban is lifted, it argues, smuggling and illegal killing will rise. </p> <p>Elizabeth Kemf, for the WWF, said: \"Controls in the main importing country, Japan, are inadequate. The status of the turtle populations in the Caribbean is unclear. Hawksbill turtles are facing an ever growing number of threats.\" </p> <p>Up to 300,000 turtles are killed each year as a \"bycatch\" in trawling and shrimp nets, and on long lines used to catch tuna and swordfish. Tourism is also a threat because some of the species' favourite sandy breeding beaches have been taken up by hotels and blocked by sea walls. </p> <p>The WWF believes that despite conservation efforts the future of this reptile, which has existed on the planet for 100m years, remains in doubt. </p> <p>Although it is known where turtles breed, exact numbers are hard to calculate because after hatching they disappear for 10 years until they reach sexual maturity. Arguments about \"sustainable harvesting\" are difficult because no one knows how large the replenishment stock is. Turtles live for 30 years, so the same adults can be recognised returning to home beaches to breed.</p>",

The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), which is involved in many international schemes to save the turtle, says that despite some successful interventions to protect breeding grounds, all the species are still endangered including the hawksbill which Cuba particularly wants to trade. Turtles are still much in demand worldwide to be stuffed, varnished and mounted. The shells are sold openly to tourists in Vietnam, Cambodia and the Caribbean, despite the international ban. Although tourists carrying such trophies back to Britain will have them confiscated by customs, the WWF does not believe that international policing efforts are good enough elsewhere. If the ban is lifted, it argues, smuggling and illegal killing will rise. Elizabeth Kemf, for the WWF, said: \"Controls in the main importing country, Japan, are inadequate. The status of the turtle populations in the Caribbean is unclear. Hawksbill turtles are facing an ever growing number of threats.\" Up to 300,000 turtles are killed each year as a \"bycatch\" in trawling and shrimp nets, and on long lines used to catch tuna and swordfish. Tourism is also a threat because some of the species' favourite sandy breeding beaches have been taken up by hotels and blocked by sea walls. The WWF believes that despite conservation efforts the future of this reptile, which has existed on the planet for 100m years, remains in doubt. Although it is known where turtles breed, exact numbers are hard to calculate because after hatching they disappear for 10 years until they reach sexual maturity. Arguments about \"sustainable harvesting\" are difficult because no one knows how large the replenishment stock is. Turtles live for 30 years, so the same adults can be recognised returning to home beaches to breed.",

At the time of the rally, the state-controlled television Politika was running a major movie marathon, showing films such as American Beauty, which many interpreted as an attempt to keep people at home. Foreign journalists who attempted to enter Serbia to cover the rally were held at the airport and refused entry, according to the independent radio station B292.

      "body": "<p>Allen Lane wanted a \"dignified but flippant\" name for his new publishing venture. His secretary came up with the name Penguin, and a member of staff was sent to London Zoo to sketch the now famous logo. </p> <p>It was typical of the company's cost savings in its early days. It was, after all, planning to sell paperback books for 6d (2p) - about the price of a pack of cigarettes. </p> <p>Penguin Books was founded in 1936. Its first premises were in a church crypt and staff had to be quiet during services. They were also paid an extra 1p a day so they could use the loo at a nearby station. </p> <p>When staff moved to a new building, they found the floor was still a cabbage patch. The floor was only laid when the cabbages were picked and sold - to help offset moving costs. </p> <p>Lane had realised there was a market for cheap classics when, returning from Agatha Christie's home, he found only magazines and Victorian novels on Exeter station bookstall. </p> <p>He was no newcomer to publishing, having left school at 16 to join his uncle's publishing firm, the Bodley Head, and rose to become managing director. Other directors were not prepared to fund his new venture, though they agreed to distribute its books. At that time hardbacks cost about eight shillings and were a success if they sold 2,000 copies - whereas the new Penguins would cost just 6d and would need to sell at least 17,000 copies to break even. </p> <p>Other publishers were equally reluctant to sell paperback rights to Lane. The first to break ranks was Jonathan Cape, who thought he might earn \u00a3400 before the new venture went bust. </p> <p>The first 10 Penguins, published in 1935, included Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms, Compton Mackenzie's Carnival and Agatha Christie's The Mysterious Affair at Styles. Within five months the firm had sold a million copies. </p> <p>After success with reprints, Penguin started to commission new works. Nikolaus Pevsner's famous series, The Buildings of England, was commissioned by Penguin, which provided him with a car and petrol - which was still rationed at the time - to research the first volume. </p> <p>Sets of books around a specific topic were labelled Penguin Specials which were to develop into the Pelican, Puffin and Peregrine ranges. The idea was triggered when Lane overheard a lady mistakenly ask for a \"pelican book\". </p> <p>The traditional typographical covers were replaced by illustrations - some by Len Deighton - by the 1960s. </p> <p>Penguin's stock market flotation in 1962 was 160 times oversubscribed. But new ventures such as educational and hardback books took their toll on the company's finances, and it was taken over by Pearson Longman in 1970. </p> <p>The company, which this week emerged victorious from the libel action by David Irving, is no stranger to the courts. In 1960 it was charged under the Obscene Publications Act when it published an unabridged version of DH Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover. </p> <p>The resulting court case gripped the public. The jury acquitted the company and ushered in the permissive Sixties. And Penguin had a best seller on its hands.</p>",

It was, after all, planning to sell paperback books for 6d (2p) - about the price of a pack of cigarettes. Penguin Books was founded in 1936. Its first premises were in a church crypt and staff had to be quiet during services. They were also paid an extra 1p a day so they could use the loo at a nearby station. When staff moved to a new building, they found the floor was still a cabbage patch. The floor was only laid when the cabbages were picked and sold - to help offset moving costs. Lane had realised there was a market for cheap classics when, returning from Agatha Christie's home, he found only magazines and Victorian novels on Exeter station bookstall. He was no newcomer to publishing, having left school at 16 to join his uncle's publishing firm, the Bodley Head, and rose to become managing director. Other directors were not prepared to fund his new venture, though they agreed to distribute its books. At that time hardbacks cost about eight shillings and were a success if they sold 2,000 copies - whereas the new Penguins would cost just 6d and would need to sell at least 17,000 copies to break even. Other publishers were equally reluctant to sell paperback rights to Lane. The first to break ranks was Jonathan Cape, who thought he might earn \u00a3400 before the new venture went bust. The first 10 Penguins, published in 1935, included Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms, Compton Mackenzie's Carnival and Agatha Christie's The Mysterious Affair at Styles. Within five months the firm had sold a million copies. After success with reprints, Penguin started to commission new works. Nikolaus Pevsner's famous series, The Buildings of England, was commissioned by Penguin, which provided him with a car and petrol - which was still rationed at the time - to research the first volume. Sets of books around a specific topic were labelled Penguin Specials which were to develop into the Pelican, Puffin and Peregrine ranges. The idea was triggered when Lane overheard a lady mistakenly ask for a \"pelican book\". The traditional typographical covers were replaced by illustrations - some by Len Deighton - by the 1960s. Penguin's stock market flotation in 1962 was 160 times oversubscribed. But new ventures such as educational and hardback books took their toll on the company's finances, and it was taken over by Pearson Longman in 1970. The company, which this week emerged victorious from the libel action by David Irving, is no stranger to the courts. In 1960 it was charged under the Obscene Publications Act when it published an unabridged version of DH Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover. The resulting court case gripped the public. The jury acquitted the company and ushered in the permissive Sixties. And Penguin had a best seller on its hands.",

The company made just \u00a3900,000 in the year-end to January, down from \u00a32.7m a year earlier. Turnover climbed nearly 10% to \u00a3121m. </p> <p>Chairman Edward Bentall, whose family owns 38% of the company, said a poor first half had done the damage, but in the last ten weeks sales were up 2.2%. Much of the drop in profits was due to losses at the Bristol store. </p> <p>The company said it had raised its sights since the collapse of merger talks with Allders last year. It has installed a new management team, intends to modernise its image, expand and update the Kingston store. The shares closed down 4p at 58.5p.</p> <p><strong> Kleinwort 'a virtual bank'</strong></p> <p>Dresdner Kleinwort Benson is to be run as a \"virtual\" investment bank, its parent company Dresdner confirmed yesterday. But the German bank, under pressure since its merger with its rival Deutsche fell apart this month, made no reference to suggestions that it might spin the unit off into a separate entity. </p> <p>Meanwhile Deutsche has called an extraordinary meeting for later this month, fuelling speculation that Rolf Breuer, the chief executive, would be forced to resign.</p> <p><strong> Serbs step up web attack</strong></p> <p>Mgm.com and manutd.com are among 2,000 websites around the world that have been targeted by Serbian hackers, raising new concerns about internet security.

The company must make any increased offer by Wednesday under UK takeover rules. </p> <p>Company insiders insisted it was still confident its 420p per share offer could win the day even though Blue Circle shares ended the day up 4.5p at 429.75p. But Blue Circle said the level of support underlined its belief \"that the value of Blue Circle is way above Lafarge's meagre offer\". </p> <p>Analysts say Lafarge needs to increase its offer to between 450p and 475p per share.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pearson eyes Mel and Griff Pearson TV is understood to be close to a \u00a370m deal to buy Talkback, the television production company founded by comedians Mel Smith and Griff Rhys-Jones. A deal that will make the comedy duo multi-millionaires is expected to be completed after Easter if due diligence goes to plan. Talkback's output includes the Ali G series and Smack the Pony. Pearson TV, which is merging with CLT-Ufa of Germany, produces 160 programmes - including Home and Away and Blind Date. Bentalls profits sharply down Department store group Bentalls is to revamp its flagship Kingston-on-Thames outlet after a big fall in profits. The company made just \u00a3900,000 in the year-end to January, down from \u00a32.7m a year earlier. Turnover climbed nearly 10% to \u00a3121m. Chairman Edward Bentall, whose family owns 38% of the company, said a poor first half had done the damage, but in the last ten weeks sales were up 2.2%. Much of the drop in profits was due to losses at the Bristol store. The company said it had raised its sights since the collapse of merger talks with Allders last year. It has installed a new management team, intends to modernise its image, expand and update the Kingston store. The shares closed down 4p at 58.5p. Kleinwort 'a virtual bank' Dresdner Kleinwort Benson is to be run as a \"virtual\" investment bank, its parent company Dresdner confirmed yesterday. But the German bank, under pressure since its merger with its rival Deutsche fell apart this month, made no reference to suggestions that it might spin the unit off into a separate entity. Meanwhile Deutsche has called an extraordinary meeting for later this month, fuelling speculation that Rolf Breuer, the chief executive, would be forced to resign. Serbs step up web attack Mgm.com and manutd.com are among 2,000 websites around the world that have been targeted by Serbian hackers, raising new concerns about internet security. The unidentified cyberterrorists gained access to e-mails and financial details of customers. Network Solution, a domain name registration business, said it was powerless to stop the raids: \"We are looking at longer-term solutions. It is challenging and we know it is something we have to deal with.\" Lafarge mulls higher bid Lafarge, the French cement maker, is expected to raise its \u00a33.4bn bid for Blue Circle after winning support from only 2.59% of shareholders. The company must make any increased offer by Wednesday under UK takeover rules. Company insiders insisted it was still confident its 420p per share offer could win the day even though Blue Circle shares ended the day up 4.5p at 429.75p. But Blue Circle said the level of support underlined its belief \"that the value of Blue Circle is way above Lafarge's meagre offer\". Analysts say Lafarge needs to increase its offer to between 450p and 475p per share.",

      "body": "<p>You have just emerged from 380 days of desk-chewing negotiation with American regulators, who are worried that you might put the cost of cruising California's highways up a few cents a gallon. A \u00a317bn deal, on ice all that time, can finally be completed, sealing an \u00a370bn asset shuffle that has positioned your company within the top three of your sector -- globally. </p> <p>Yet back in London, an extraordinary alliance has sprung up between environmental activitists and middle English shareholders. One lot are fuming about your polar ambitions; the others just want to know, exactly, how you might possibly have the time both to run their company and spend your eye-popping salary. The result is a small, but noticeable \"no confidence\" vote at your firm's annual general meeting. </p> <p>Just to add some pepper to the mix, a government minister has taken to the news wires, postulating on how various companies' commercial decisions might be remoulded so as to coincide with the country's declared foreign policy. Your job, it seems, is in danger of partial nationalisation. </p> <p>So, how do you look the next morning? In the case of Sir John Browne, chief executive of BP Amoco, there is no sign of the sleepless night. The regimental flash of gold at the sharply-pressed cuffs is still there. The voice is textured and smooth. There is no flap. The John Browne show, running at BP's understated City of London headquarters, goes on. </p> <p>It has been rolling for four years now and, whatever portion you put down to the man himself rather than circumstance, personal fortune or corporate prowess, the change really does show. In 1996, BP was emerging from 1992's cut dividend and the departure of chief executive Robert Horton. The company had been lucky to remain independent. </p> <p><strong> Expat childhood</strong></p> <p> David Simon (now Lord and a government minister) had worked at rebuilding morale before handing over to Browne, an engineer turned financier who, despite an expat childhood, had followed his father into the oil company. </p> <p>Browne junior won his corporate spurs in the mid-80s, devising a (legitimate) tax dodge which revitalised North Sea exploration, but cost the Treasury hundreds of millions. In September 1996, freshly ensconced as chief executive, he led BP's front bench on an away-day (for two days) to the Four Seasons hotel in Berlin. There Browne mapped out his vision. </p> <p>BP would cut its fixation with assets and concentrate on profits. It would fix its business mix, both geographically and between oil and gas. It would also stop being a simple, insular \"British\" company. </p> <p>Four years on, the market capitalisation has grown five-fold and by the time BP completes its takeover of Atlantic Richfield early next week its value will stand at something like \u00a3130bn. Now the immediate work is towards a fresh rebranding - the famous green shield is out (much too oilly) and the Amoco suffix which BP gained with last year's \u00a330bn takeover of its Chicago-based rival will also disappear. </p> <p>This clean, self-declared socially responsible multinational will be known simply as BP - the \"b\" and \"p\" standing for nothing in particular other than those ubiquitous corporate declarations of \"customer service\" and \"shareholder value.\" </p> <p>The fuel driving the man, driving this new version of BP amounts to \"challenge, excitement and passion - passion for the company, passion for its future because I think we can do something different.\" </p> <p>\"We can grow and perform and do our business respectably,\" says Browne. \"I think that's the right word.\" </p> <p>He claims to have had an \"interesting day\" at Thursday's AGM. \"I have to make the point that while 13% voted for the Greenpeace resolution (for BP to halt its Alaskan Northstar development), 87% voted against. In a representational democracy one has to think about that.\" Browne and his colleagues have \"lots of dialogue\" with Greenpeace and he hopes it continues. But coming face to face with shareholders lambasting his \u00a34m salary last year clearly taught the chief executive a thing or two. And yes he will continue running BP - if only because \"it's fun\". </p> <p>Four years ago the \"product portfolio didn't make sense. We didn't have the capability to spread our learning around the world - BP felt like a two-pipeline company.\" Browne is now thinking about how the company really will grow. \"New ideas, new ways of doing things - some of which are to do with the so-called new economy - which is mainly to do with efficiency.\" </p> <p>He has a serious dose of this new economy thing. BP was a \"pretty British company,\" where the Brits are now in the minority. It was also \"quite male dominated\". </p> <p>Reform has been fast and deep, and extends now to deciding whether the company really needs so many prime location office blocks around the world. </p> <p>Occupancy levels on the two executive floors at Britannic House in the City are said to be around 20% at any one time; \"people are always connected, but they are out there working.\" </p> <p>\"What you can say about the new economy is that it changes the way we work. Email has long been mission critical, but six months from now you will have to be web-literate to even survive within BP.\" </p> <p>Yet he insists that, whatever the technology, whatever the rebranding, BP will retain its Britishness. \"We are very clearly headquartered in UK. This is our home and it is a great place to do business from. Sure, there are some annoying things, such as the government's changes on double taxation - but this is our home even though less than 25% of the company is now in the UK.\" </p> <p><strong> Invest in understanding</strong></p> <p> The double taxation issue, slipped into last month's Budget and reckoned to have landed a multi-billion pound bill on the mat of numerous British-based multinationals, rankles. \"What is annoying is that it happened without consultation. It was a surprise. This is supposed to be a country which attracts multinationals and we should remember that the economy here is too small just to have people working in the UK. Will it mean everyone leaves the UK? That is extreme, but it does corrode people's confidence in the UK as a place to do business.\" </p> <p>Browne moves on to what he sees as the political fringe - non-governmental organisations that would like to dictate how BP goes about its business and individuals who would prefer that BP did not exist at all. \"There is no doubt it is an issue. You have to - how can I put this? - invest in understanding the issue and not add to the issue inadvertently. </p> <p>\"Inside the company we have people who spend their whole time worrying about human rights, checking how we are performing against our promises. We have to look at how you keep investing in a community where you are operating, without absorbing the role of the government,\" Brown declares, before adding that a current 1.25% of BP's post-tax profits (\u00a367m at the last count) is channelled directly into \"social investment.\" </p> <p>His point is that the 80,000 or so who work for BP do not leave their humanity at home when they head for the office or the oil field. For Browne himself, striding between deals and regulators and governments, and being careful to miss the political landmines along the way, it is not clear anymore what \"home\" means.</p>",

      "bodyText": "You have just emerged from 380 days of desk-chewing negotiation with American regulators, who are worried that you might put the cost of cruising California's highways up a few cents a gallon. A \u00a317bn deal, on ice all that time, can finally be completed, sealing an \u00a370bn asset shuffle that has positioned your company within the top three of your sector -- globally. Yet back in London, an extraordinary alliance has sprung up between environmental activitists and middle English shareholders. One lot are fuming about your polar ambitions; the others just want to know, exactly, how you might possibly have the time both to run their company and spend your eye-popping salary. The result is a small, but noticeable \"no confidence\" vote at your firm's annual general meeting. Just to add some pepper to the mix, a government minister has taken to the news wires, postulating on how various companies' commercial decisions might be remoulded so as to coincide with the country's declared foreign policy. Your job, it seems, is in danger of partial nationalisation. So, how do you look the next morning? In the case of Sir John Browne, chief executive of BP Amoco, there is no sign of the sleepless night. The regimental flash of gold at the sharply-pressed cuffs is still there. The voice is textured and smooth. There is no flap. The John Browne show, running at BP's understated City of London headquarters, goes on. It has been rolling for four years now and, whatever portion you put down to the man himself rather than circumstance, personal fortune or corporate prowess, the change really does show. In 1996, BP was emerging from 1992's cut dividend and the departure of chief executive Robert Horton. The company had been lucky to remain independent. Expat childhood David Simon (now Lord and a government minister) had worked at rebuilding morale before handing over to Browne, an engineer turned financier who, despite an expat childhood, had followed his father into the oil company. Browne junior won his corporate spurs in the mid-80s, devising a (legitimate) tax dodge which revitalised North Sea exploration, but cost the Treasury hundreds of millions. In September 1996, freshly ensconced as chief executive, he led BP's front bench on an away-day (for two days) to the Four Seasons hotel in Berlin. There Browne mapped out his vision. BP would cut its fixation with assets and concentrate on profits. It would fix its business mix, both geographically and between oil and gas. It would also stop being a simple, insular \"British\" company. Four years on, the market capitalisation has grown five-fold and by the time BP completes its takeover of Atlantic Richfield early next week its value will stand at something like \u00a3130bn. Now the immediate work is towards a fresh rebranding - the famous green shield is out (much too oilly) and the Amoco suffix which BP gained with last year's \u00a330bn takeover of its Chicago-based rival will also disappear. This clean, self-declared socially responsible multinational will be known simply as BP - the \"b\" and \"p\" standing for nothing in particular other than those ubiquitous corporate declarations of \"customer service\" and \"shareholder value.\" The fuel driving the man, driving this new version of BP amounts to \"challenge, excitement and passion - passion for the company, passion for its future because I think we can do something different.\" \"We can grow and perform and do our business respectably,\" says Browne. \"I think that's the right word.\" He claims to have had an \"interesting day\" at Thursday's AGM. \"I have to make the point that while 13% voted for the Greenpeace resolution (for BP to halt its Alaskan Northstar development), 87% voted against. In a representational democracy one has to think about that.\" Browne and his colleagues have \"lots of dialogue\" with Greenpeace and he hopes it continues. But coming face to face with shareholders lambasting his \u00a34m salary last year clearly taught the chief executive a thing or two. And yes he will continue running BP - if only because \"it's fun\". Four years ago the \"product portfolio didn't make sense. We didn't have the capability to spread our learning around the world - BP felt like a two-pipeline company.\" Browne is now thinking about how the company really will grow. \"New ideas, new ways of doing things - some of which are to do with the so-called new economy - which is mainly to do with efficiency.\" He has a serious dose of this new economy thing. BP was a \"pretty British company,\" where the Brits are now in the minority. It was also \"quite male dominated\". Reform has been fast and deep, and extends now to deciding whether the company really needs so many prime location office blocks around the world. Occupancy levels on the two executive floors at Britannic House in the City are said to be around 20% at any one time; \"people are always connected, but they are out there working.\" \"What you can say about the new economy is that it changes the way we work. Email has long been mission critical, but six months from now you will have to be web-literate to even survive within BP.\" Yet he insists that, whatever the technology, whatever the rebranding, BP will retain its Britishness. \"We are very clearly headquartered in UK. This is our home and it is a great place to do business from. Sure, there are some annoying things, such as the government's changes on double taxation - but this is our home even though less than 25% of the company is now in the UK.\" Invest in understanding The double taxation issue, slipped into last month's Budget and reckoned to have landed a multi-billion pound bill on the mat of numerous British-based multinationals, rankles. \"What is annoying is that it happened without consultation. It was a surprise. This is supposed to be a country which attracts multinationals and we should remember that the economy here is too small just to have people working in the UK. Will it mean everyone leaves the UK? That is extreme, but it does corrode people's confidence in the UK as a place to do business.\" Browne moves on to what he sees as the political fringe - non-governmental organisations that would like to dictate how BP goes about its business and individuals who would prefer that BP did not exist at all. \"There is no doubt it is an issue. You have to - how can I put this? - invest in understanding the issue and not add to the issue inadvertently. \"Inside the company we have people who spend their whole time worrying about human rights, checking how we are performing against our promises. We have to look at how you keep investing in a community where you are operating, without absorbing the role of the government,\" Brown declares, before adding that a current 1.25% of BP's post-tax profits (\u00a367m at the last count) is channelled directly into \"social investment.\" His point is that the 80,000 or so who work for BP do not leave their humanity at home when they head for the office or the oil field. For Browne himself, striding between deals and regulators and governments, and being careful to miss the political landmines along the way, it is not clear anymore what \"home\" means.",

      "bodyText": "Panic selling on Wall Street sent share prices tumbling on both sides of the Atlantic last night as fears of higher US interest rates sent tremors through the markets. Both the blue-chip Dow Jones Index and the technology-based Nasdaq index suffered huge losses after official figures showed that America's longest-ever boom is pushing up prices in shops and stores. By lunchtime in New York, the Dow had fallen more than 350 points, while the Nasdaq was suffering its fifth successive decline and was down by more than 200 points. Wall Street jitters quickly spread to London, sparking broad-based selling which left the FTSE index of leading shares down 178.9 points at 6178.1. The Techmark 100 index dropped 5.2% to 3,528, ending a miserable week during which it lost nearly 20% of its value from the previous Friday's close. In New York, where the Nasdaq has dropped 1,000 points in a week and lost almost a third of its value since early March, analysts said many small investors were being forced to liquidate holdings to pay margin calls - shares bought with borrowed money. Recent data showed a hefty increase in margin calls over the past six months, but the trend has left investors vulnerable to a bear market, with on-line brokerages automatically selling shares bought on credit as prices have fallen. Analysts said the enforced sales and the new mood of fear meant that the declines were becoming self-feeding. \"It was a momentum market on the way up, it is a momentum market on the way down,\" said Nick Sargen, chief investment strategist for JP Morgan. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, made no mention of the recent market turbulence during a speech in Washington. However, the 22% drop in the Nasdaq during the past week - bigger than the fall in the Dow Jones Index during the 1987 stock market crash -will cast a shadow over the meeting in Washington today of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven industrial nations. The International Monetary Fund warned earlier this week that \"very high stock market valuations around the world\" posed one of the biggest threats to continued global growth, noting that the high valuations put on technology stocks might \"reflect unrealistic expectations of future earnings growth that have been nourished by the now record-long expansion in the US\". The trigger for yesterday's meltdown was the release of inflation figures by the US government showing consumer prices in March rose 0.7% - higher than the 0.5% the markets had been expecting. Although part of the increase was due to dearer fuel as a result of higher oil prices, the underlying increase of 0.4% was double what dealers were anticipating, and prompted speculation that Mr Greenspan might raise interest rates by half a point when the Fed meets next month. At its peak in March, the Nasdaq stood at 5,048.62 following an 86% rise in 1999. Analysts said there was now a belated recognition that valuations had become unrealistic.

When, four years later, she was reunited with Mesud, he was repelled by the existence of the boy and Zheljka excruciatingly gave him up for illegal adoption. </p> <p>Mette, intercepting a letter which reveals that the adoption has been disastrous, conceives an obsessive plan to acquire Zero for herself. And so is initiated the extraordinary cross-border transportation of a child cargo. </p> <p>Thus summarised, the novel sounds like a thriller. And indeed it is, but of conflicting moral constraints, psychic needs and political pragmatism. Senstad is also an artful mistress of the regular thriller's coups de th\u00e9tre. There's a shoplifter in the novel, introduced with the same nonchalant stealth as the character uses to spirit away her booty. The book's many scenes of anguish are made physical, taking place in an embodied, materially precise world: Senstad uses striking, almost cinematic, tableaux to explore the prising apart of parent and child. </p> <p>Among the most electric passages in the book are the meetings between Mette, the needy, calculating and often insensitive \"war tourist\", and Zheljka, a woman who has learned to vacate her body in order to survive. Each wants her own tragedy to register with the other: the complexity of need and counter-need is caught and pinioned with a steely sensibility. </p> <p>Inevitably, there are flaws. This is a book driven by psychological insight, with the author as therapist: just occasionally it's difficult to tell if the deep awareness is the author's alone or if it is also being imputed to the characters. And however nuanced her characterisation, Senstad does sometimes fall back on stereotype. Her Holocaust survivors are weeping, howling ghosts; her infertile women (there are two) are crazed, irrational baby-thieves. </p> <p>Senstad is highly ambitious and risk-taking. Zheljka is a piano student, and the opening chapters try to tune in not just to words but also to the sounds between them (hence the book's title). This is too self-conscious to be really illuminating, and thankfully the author jettisons the device for most of the rest of the book. </p> <p>Elsewhere, in one short, audacious chapter, Senstad describes Zheljka's profoundly split feelings about her pregnancy - \"that jellyboned growth like some cancer, her - she retches up the word - her - oh God must have had something else in mind when creating such a thing, her - please, die! - son\". This is fine writing in the style of Anne Michaels, in which the language seems to have been threshed directly from the feelings rather than from the usual literary sources. </p> <p>Later in the book, Senstad attempts to pin down the actual experience of Serb brutality. Fictionally speaking, there is not a lot that one can do with torture, apart from shaming the reader for not having shared the character's suffering and daring to sit there simply reading about it. Torture lends the author a cheap power, against which, as a reader, I always bridle. </p> <p>Indeed, there are places in the early part of Music for the Third Ear where the mix of chronology, location and atrocity begins to wear one down. But then Senstad's lighter touch comes into play. She is herself married to a Norwegian and is a wry guide around cultural assumptions (her contrasting sketches of the self-deceptions of Norwegian and Italian society are delicious), and gendered reactions: at least two of her main male characters \"feel with their thoughts\". </p> <p>Ultimately, Senstad offers a remarkable and highly subtle exploration of the aftermath of brutality and Europeans' successive experiences of exile. And to think that this is only her first published work.</p> <p>\u0095 Anne Karpf is the author of The War After, published by Mandarin.</p>",

Each wants her own tragedy to register with the other: the complexity of need and counter-need is caught and pinioned with a steely sensibility. Inevitably, there are flaws. This is a book driven by psychological insight, with the author as therapist: just occasionally it's difficult to tell if the deep awareness is the author's alone or if it is also being imputed to the characters. And however nuanced her characterisation, Senstad does sometimes fall back on stereotype. Her Holocaust survivors are weeping, howling ghosts; her infertile women (there are two) are crazed, irrational baby-thieves. Senstad is highly ambitious and risk-taking. Zheljka is a piano student, and the opening chapters try to tune in not just to words but also to the sounds between them (hence the book's title). This is too self-conscious to be really illuminating, and thankfully the author jettisons the device for most of the rest of the book. Elsewhere, in one short, audacious chapter, Senstad describes Zheljka's profoundly split feelings about her pregnancy - \"that jellyboned growth like some cancer, her - she retches up the word - her - oh God must have had something else in mind when creating such a thing, her - please, die! - son\". This is fine writing in the style of Anne Michaels, in which the language seems to have been threshed directly from the feelings rather than from the usual literary sources. Later in the book, Senstad attempts to pin down the actual experience of Serb brutality. Fictionally speaking, there is not a lot that one can do with torture, apart from shaming the reader for not having shared the character's suffering and daring to sit there simply reading about it. Torture lends the author a cheap power, against which, as a reader, I always bridle. Indeed, there are places in the early part of Music for the Third Ear where the mix of chronology, location and atrocity begins to wear one down. But then Senstad's lighter touch comes into play. She is herself married to a Norwegian and is a wry guide around cultural assumptions (her contrasting sketches of the self-deceptions of Norwegian and Italian society are delicious), and gendered reactions: at least two of her main male characters \"feel with their thoughts\". Ultimately, Senstad offers a remarkable and highly subtle exploration of the aftermath of brutality and Europeans' successive experiences of exile. And to think that this is only her first published work. \u0095 Anne Karpf is the author of The War After, published by Mandarin.",

She appears again here, but has become almost a default setting for the Dunmore short story: Ulli is pregnant and unhappy on a French exchange (lovely flora and fauna, though). Ulli goes home with a strange man whose room is crammed with religious icons. In addition to Ulli, there is a succession of rather similar adolescent girls; the blending of character and consistency of much of the descriptive tone make the stories blur into vagueness. </p> <p>When Dunmore goes for something radically different, the effect is jarring. \"Leonardo, Michelangelo, Superstork\", an SF idea-driven piece - cloned embryo implantation has replaced natural conception and all women must be fitted with a wonderfully named \"rubicon\" to block genetically inferior sperm - has a Roald Dahl-esque showiness to it. Likewise \"Mason's Mini-Break\", in which a pompous writer ends up patronising the ghost of Charlotte Bront\u00eb on the moors, the penny dropping when his wife returns from the parsonage with her portrait, commenting on her exclusion from the literary establishment of the time. \"Amazing how some people don't see what's under their noses, isn't it?...

In \"Swimming into the Millennium\", a middle-aged woman escapes whining family and Y2K pressure for a \"sleek, still\" pool and the aquatic friendship of a young male couple, full of love and free of responsibility for Christmas shopping and ex-mothers-in-law, who \"have so much that it spills over on to me\". \"My Polish Teacher's Tie\" sees a school dinner lady jettison shame and self-consciousness to recover her past and her possibilities. The voices are utterly convincing, the structural arcs pleasing and accomplished without the kerplunk of laboured epiphany. </p> <p>Elsewhere, though the sentences sing, style is not enough.

This would have been horrible for Ovid: he was sent to the furthest limit of the Roman Empire, a shithole called Tomis situated in what is now Romania (once a dump, always a dump, it would appear).

Augustus is praised in the most bizarre fashions; the information becomes confused, unreliable, bizarre. When he asks how the month of May got its name, he confesses ignorance and, when he asks the Muses, even they disagree. Divinity and order are continually undermined; he omits crucial dates from the calendar, and while he celebrates a huge number of battles and their anniversaries, half of them are defeats. It is a jab in the Augustan eyeball. \"Ovid's Fasti,\" say the editors, \"is a revolutionary act.\" </p> <p>We're coming in on the joke a bit late, though, and this is why we should salute not only Ovid - the guy sure could write - but the editors, who have translated the original line by line (with very few exceptions, they add; but always couplet by couplet) while managing to keep something of Ovid's metre and versification. It is an extraordinary technical accomplishment, and when you consider the amount of work that must have gone into the exceptionally informative notes, one can only feel a kind of awe at the quantity and quality of scholarship involved.

There is no sign that Babbage realised, as Alan Turing did 100 years later, that such a computer would be able to handle not just mathematical and logical problems but every form of information that exists. </p> <p>At this point an intriguing person enters the story: Ada Lovelace, Byron's daughter, who became a friend and collaborator. She had huge intellectual ambitions and a prophetic feel for the importance of Babbage's work, and went beyond him in seeing the potential for processing more than numbers: \"Supposing for instance that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical expression were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the Engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree or extent.\" This was in fact a prediction of modern \"generative\" computer music software - although Babbage would probably not have approved of this application, his last years being dedicated to waging a campaign against street music which led to musicians deliberately pestering him at home. </p> <p>Part of The Cogwheel Brain is devoted to Swade's account of building a working version of Babbage's Difference Engine No 2 (designed in 1846 using the knowledge gleaned from the Analytical Engine, but never built) for the Babbage bicentenary in 1991.

When it is finally finished, the work freezes the faces of the duke's household into the plaster forever. Christensen's role as writer is, of course, to put blood and passion back into these characters - easy enough when Renaissance Italy hands her intrigue, incest, love and the power of the church without resistance.

The Painted Room Inger Christensen Harvill, \u00a37.99 Buy it at BOL In 1460 Ludovico, Duke of Mantua invites the painter Mantegna to decorate a room in his palace. The \"divine decorator\", as the duke's disgruntled secretary Marsilio calls him, builds a house, brings peacocks to the palace but takes years to begin work on his fresco. When it is finally finished, the work freezes the faces of the duke's household into the plaster forever. Christensen's role as writer is, of course, to put blood and passion back into these characters - easy enough when Renaissance Italy hands her intrigue, incest, love and the power of the church without resistance. The task is neatly accomplished, but it's too mannered to seem more than an exercise in style.",

Had he followed through with this, he might have accessed a deeper seam of creativity than the one depleted by his habitual reliance on \"enormous overdoses of benzedrine\" and phenobarbital used to \"offset the benny depression eight hours after ingestion\" (after eight hours of writing). </p> <p>He also experimented with acid but, while his old pals Allen Ginsberg and Neal Cassady happily played their part in fomenting a psychedelic revolution, Kerouac became increasingly hostile to the narco-ideological claims of the emergent hippy movement. The fact that hippies were the progeny of the Beats, that his passionate immersion in Buddhism anticipated their own fascination with all things Eastern, served only to strengthen his befuddled reactionary resolve. As Timothy Leary recalled, Kerouac \"remained unmovably the Catholic carouser, an old-style Bohemian without a hippy bone in his body\". Convinced his ideas were \"being lifted by Jews\" such as Ginsberg, Kerouac sank into a swamp of paranoia and buffoonish alcoholism. </p> <p>\"Free to do anything I want,\" he wrote in 1962, \"I've deliberately imprisoned myself, like a hair shirt, I dunno why.\" In style this shirt was curiously similar to one later sported in Hull by Philip Larkin. Pining for a cabin in the woods, Kerouac actually settled for the suburbs of Florida or Massachusetts, where he lived with his mother amid \"endless rows of perfect new houses but all of them without exception full of flat housewives looking out of the window when someone dares to try to walk to the stores which are too far away anyway under broiling sun under flat treeless waste, ugh\". Even at this distance from the limelight, word always got out that the king of the Beats was in the vicinity, and Kerouac would be lured off on week-long swill-outs, \"drinking and talking with hundreds and hundreds of my acquaintances day and night in shifts\". </p> <p>One day, in a snapshot, he saw what \"all this lionised manure has done to me; it's killing me rapidly\". His situation was made doubly intolerable by the fact that the lionisation didn't stop him getting critically pilloried.

Their friendship blossomed only in the last dozen years of Rebecca's long life, but since it was chiefly on Jill's prompting that Rebecca returned to the journalism of her flaming youth, the two of them together took the century in their feminist strides. Like Jill, Rebecca was an artist in everything she touched and saw. Each had a specially sharpened visual sense, which Jill could translate into films and pictures, and Rebecca into words. </p> <p>Again and again throughout our own quite lengthy lives, Jill and I found ourselves bumping afresh into some revelation of the HG Wells-Rebecca West saga. I first met him at a weekend party at Max Beaverbrook's country estate in the late 1930s. He was the hero of my early twenties, having completed my conversion to socialism with Tono-Bungay and several other of his titles. At his side on that occasion was not Rebecca but his last and maybe truest love, Moura Budberg. She became for me a heroine, too, keeping alive my connection with HG until he died eight years later. </p> <p>The HG Wells of the second world war fought with all his might for the rights of man; Beaverbrook's Evening Standard played a notable part in that victory, proudly printing every one of his red-hot revolutionary words. Both Jill and I fell victims to Max Beaverbrook's charm. Outside observers could not understand the relationship, but he was a firm friend to both of us until the day of his death. No topic of conversation seemed to be banned between us - especially his interest in the worlds of HG Wells, Arnold Bennett and so forth - but in all our conversations, one name never cropped up: that of Rebecca West. </p> <p>Not until years later, when HG and Max and Rebecca were all dead, did Rebecca's posthumously published novel Sunflower tell the story of how the slightly ageing HG was displaced in her affections by the magnificent young Max. It was a delicate, matchless love story, intelligently told. But no one could know about this at the time; Rebecca was presumably resolved to give offence to neither of her lovers. </p> <p>What happened between Rebecca and Max in their original affair is not finally clarified either in the novel or in these letters, but every later development is honourable to them both. He helped her directly in her journalistic career, and would do his best to assist when her more outrageous friends, such as the anarchist leader Emma Goldman, were being pilloried in the newspapers. </p> <p>If you have not yet read Sunflower, order your copy now. Don't be deterred by some of the jealous reviewers who dismissed the work as inferior when it did finally appear; Rebecca knew better. </p> <p>Her suppression of the novel must have been all the more galling when she saw that her literary opponents showed no such reticence. Enemy number one was her own son by HG, Anthony West, who wrote a damning autobiographical novel, Heritage, while Rebecca was still alive, and pursued his vendetta even after her death with an unrelenting fury that can still turn the stomach.</p> <p>In these pages she can defend herself against all his accusations. \"Posterity will never forgive a bad mother,\" she would sometimes say to Jill. Here she is vindicated; Anthony gets his due. He had, for example, a terrible quarrel with his father in HG's last days which he wretchedly tried to blame on Rebecca; in fact, it was much more the result of his own imperfect sympathies with his father. </p> <p>Along with many writers of the century, headed by HG himself, Rebecca understood the importance of Anglo-American associations - she made her name in the US in the 1920s, and ever after kept a foot on both sides of the Atlantic - so the editing of this volume by the American Bonnie Kime Scott is all the more appropriate. </p> <p>Some of the best liberal spirits of the age became her closest friends. A few of them at moments of stress might have questioned her allegiance, but, if need be, she could counter-attack with all her polemical might. Her insights take command at the most appropriate moments: \"The Statue of Liberty,\" she said at her first glance, \"is a washout - she gets her stays at the same place as Queen Mary's.\" </p> <p>A most prolific letter writer herself - she claimed sometimes to write several before breakfast - she had a special appreciation of how full volumes of letters could inform a proper judgment of the greatest writers. She had not always been as aware of Oscar Wilde's genius as might have been expected, for instance, but after his letters were published she sent his son Vyvyan Holland a glowing response, full of fresh understanding: \"I don't think anyone could read the volume without liking your father more than before.\" These words were intended to bring comfort to Merlin, Oscar's grandson, as well as to his father. The Rebecca who wrote this letter and several more of the same quality truly knew what love was. </p> <p>But what of her relationship with HG, the most significant of her life? They had their rows, but nothing to compare with the savagery of those with Anthony. For several years after their first meeting, HG drew on his own new knowledge of Rebecca to portray the new woman - from Fanny in The Dream to Helen in The World of William Clissold - and what a wonderful breed she was. The literary connection between the two was brilliantly unravelled by JR Hammond in his HG Wells and Rebecca West, published in 1991. He showed how each was indispensable to the other, and where each could claim to be innovators. </p> <p>The last book I read to Jill was this collection of letters from the woman she so greatly honoured. No hardship, I can assure you: the wit pours forth on every page along with the lamentations. Jill sometimes suspected me of treating her Rebecca less kindly than I should - especially when HG was misbehaving in a big way. And yet, having read and re-read every word, the main conclusion is unchallengeable. The love between them triumphed over everything else: the reconciliations were always much more significant than the ruptures.</p> <p>The last of these came in the 1940s, when they shared a vision that the England they both loved could rejoice in a victory over the forces of evil. Anthony failed to join that period of exhilaration: he even helped to spread the insinuation that his father's mind was failing. The reality was nothing of the kind: with Moura on one side and Rebecca on the other, he was celebrating the freedom which he had done as much as any of his countrymen to secure. </p> <p><strong>West in her own words</strong></p> <p> <strong> To HG Wells, 1913, a year before their son Anthony was born</strong> </p> <p>\"During the next few days I shall either put a bullet through my head or commit something more shattering to myself than death... I don't understand why you wanted me three months ago and don't want me now... It's something... I despise. And the worst of it is that if I despise you I rage because you stand between me and peace. Of course you're quite right. I haven't anything to give you. You have only a passion for excitement and for comfort. You don't want any more excitement and I do not give people comfort...\" </p> <p><strong> To George Bernard Shaw, 1917, thanking him for sending her a copy of a life of Oscar Wilde</strong> </p> <p>\"I can never make out why there is all this fuss about Wilde. Of course it is impossible for people of my generation to give any just estimate of his position as an artist because you have so completely wiped him up in the theatre. And I have always been prejudiced against him because of the plea that his sentence should have been remitted because he was an artist, which seems to me unworthy of the aristocrat that an artist should be. But what an argument for Home Rule the book is. There are things in it which increase one's contempt for Ireland - notably the photograph of Sir William Wilde. A country where a man who looked like an embittered mandril could have a family in every farmhouse must be in a deplorable state.\" </p> <p><strong> To George Orwell, 1946</strong> </p> <p>\"I feel you don't understand Henry Miller as I do, an extremely offensive assumption, and I shall forgive you if you resent it. I can only offer as an excuse that possibly you haven't seen as much of him as I have... Miller is a German-American - his German origin accounts for his prose - who after a good petty bourgeois upbringing took a job with the Western Union Cable Corporation, of which he eventually became a Vice-President. He then married a lurid trollop of curiously mixed atmosphere... and she upset him and led him astray into all sorts of trouble that didn't go too well with the Western Union... It then occurred to him that there was a way of getting out of all this trouble... and that was to write obscure literature as an expatriate in Paris. He thought this out quite coolly. As part of this... stunt he froze on to a guileless pair - a young American bank representative named Guiler who was married to a beautiful woman called Ana\u00efs Nin, whom I think the only real genius I have ever known in my life.\" </p> <p><strong> To her son Anthony in 1961</strong> </p> <p>\"You have one grievance against me, and one only: that I did not have an abortion and kill you. This seems to me a most peculiar grievance for a man who has, I imagine, had a good deal of happiness out of his life... You can't be so hopelessly stupid that you think that I, given my particular makeup, would have chosen to have an illegitimate child. I had a love affair with HG and I loved him then as I was always to love him, on the understanding that he would not give me a child, a promise he wantonly broke simply because he wanted the panache of having a child by the infant prodigy of the day. I was appalled by the situation when it arose, and the more so by the way that HG handled it... I felt I had to make every sacrifice to compensate to you for the suffering you might undergo. It was no difficulty to make these sacrifices because I loved you very much.\"</p>",

No topic of conversation seemed to be banned between us - especially his interest in the worlds of HG Wells, Arnold Bennett and so forth - but in all our conversations, one name never cropped up: that of Rebecca West. Not until years later, when HG and Max and Rebecca were all dead, did Rebecca's posthumously published novel Sunflower tell the story of how the slightly ageing HG was displaced in her affections by the magnificent young Max. It was a delicate, matchless love story, intelligently told. But no one could know about this at the time; Rebecca was presumably resolved to give offence to neither of her lovers. What happened between Rebecca and Max in their original affair is not finally clarified either in the novel or in these letters, but every later development is honourable to them both. He helped her directly in her journalistic career, and would do his best to assist when her more outrageous friends, such as the anarchist leader Emma Goldman, were being pilloried in the newspapers. If you have not yet read Sunflower, order your copy now. Don't be deterred by some of the jealous reviewers who dismissed the work as inferior when it did finally appear; Rebecca knew better. Her suppression of the novel must have been all the more galling when she saw that her literary opponents showed no such reticence. Enemy number one was her own son by HG, Anthony West, who wrote a damning autobiographical novel, Heritage, while Rebecca was still alive, and pursued his vendetta even after her death with an unrelenting fury that can still turn the stomach. In these pages she can defend herself against all his accusations. \"Posterity will never forgive a bad mother,\" she would sometimes say to Jill. Here she is vindicated; Anthony gets his due. He had, for example, a terrible quarrel with his father in HG's last days which he wretchedly tried to blame on Rebecca; in fact, it was much more the result of his own imperfect sympathies with his father. Along with many writers of the century, headed by HG himself, Rebecca understood the importance of Anglo-American associations - she made her name in the US in the 1920s, and ever after kept a foot on both sides of the Atlantic - so the editing of this volume by the American Bonnie Kime Scott is all the more appropriate. Some of the best liberal spirits of the age became her closest friends. A few of them at moments of stress might have questioned her allegiance, but, if need be, she could counter-attack with all her polemical might. Her insights take command at the most appropriate moments: \"The Statue of Liberty,\" she said at her first glance, \"is a washout - she gets her stays at the same place as Queen Mary's.\" A most prolific letter writer herself - she claimed sometimes to write several before breakfast - she had a special appreciation of how full volumes of letters could inform a proper judgment of the greatest writers. She had not always been as aware of Oscar Wilde's genius as might have been expected, for instance, but after his letters were published she sent his son Vyvyan Holland a glowing response, full of fresh understanding: \"I don't think anyone could read the volume without liking your father more than before.\" These words were intended to bring comfort to Merlin, Oscar's grandson, as well as to his father. The Rebecca who wrote this letter and several more of the same quality truly knew what love was. But what of her relationship with HG, the most significant of her life? They had their rows, but nothing to compare with the savagery of those with Anthony. For several years after their first meeting, HG drew on his own new knowledge of Rebecca to portray the new woman - from Fanny in The Dream to Helen in The World of William Clissold - and what a wonderful breed she was. The literary connection between the two was brilliantly unravelled by JR Hammond in his HG Wells and Rebecca West, published in 1991. He showed how each was indispensable to the other, and where each could claim to be innovators. The last book I read to Jill was this collection of letters from the woman she so greatly honoured. No hardship, I can assure you: the wit pours forth on every page along with the lamentations. Jill sometimes suspected me of treating her Rebecca less kindly than I should - especially when HG was misbehaving in a big way. And yet, having read and re-read every word, the main conclusion is unchallengeable. The love between them triumphed over everything else: the reconciliations were always much more significant than the ruptures. The last of these came in the 1940s, when they shared a vision that the England they both loved could rejoice in a victory over the forces of evil. Anthony failed to join that period of exhilaration: he even helped to spread the insinuation that his father's mind was failing. The reality was nothing of the kind: with Moura on one side and Rebecca on the other, he was celebrating the freedom which he had done as much as any of his countrymen to secure. West in her own words To HG Wells, 1913, a year before their son Anthony was born \"During the next few days I shall either put a bullet through my head or commit something more shattering to myself than death... I don't understand why you wanted me three months ago and don't want me now... It's something... I despise. And the worst of it is that if I despise you I rage because you stand between me and peace. Of course you're quite right. I haven't anything to give you. You have only a passion for excitement and for comfort. You don't want any more excitement and I do not give people comfort...\" To George Bernard Shaw, 1917, thanking him for sending her a copy of a life of Oscar Wilde \"I can never make out why there is all this fuss about Wilde. Of course it is impossible for people of my generation to give any just estimate of his position as an artist because you have so completely wiped him up in the theatre. And I have always been prejudiced against him because of the plea that his sentence should have been remitted because he was an artist, which seems to me unworthy of the aristocrat that an artist should be. But what an argument for Home Rule the book is. There are things in it which increase one's contempt for Ireland - notably the photograph of Sir William Wilde. A country where a man who looked like an embittered mandril could have a family in every farmhouse must be in a deplorable state.\" To George Orwell, 1946 \"I feel you don't understand Henry Miller as I do, an extremely offensive assumption, and I shall forgive you if you resent it. I can only offer as an excuse that possibly you haven't seen as much of him as I have... Miller is a German-American - his German origin accounts for his prose - who after a good petty bourgeois upbringing took a job with the Western Union Cable Corporation, of which he eventually became a Vice-President. He then married a lurid trollop of curiously mixed atmosphere... and she upset him and led him astray into all sorts of trouble that didn't go too well with the Western Union... It then occurred to him that there was a way of getting out of all this trouble... and that was to write obscure literature as an expatriate in Paris. He thought this out quite coolly. As part of this... stunt he froze on to a guileless pair - a young American bank representative named Guiler who was married to a beautiful woman called Ana\u00efs Nin, whom I think the only real genius I have ever known in my life.\" To her son Anthony in 1961 \"You have one grievance against me, and one only: that I did not have an abortion and kill you. This seems to me a most peculiar grievance for a man who has, I imagine, had a good deal of happiness out of his life... You can't be so hopelessly stupid that you think that I, given my particular makeup, would have chosen to have an illegitimate child. I had a love affair with HG and I loved him then as I was always to love him, on the understanding that he would not give me a child, a promise he wantonly broke simply because he wanted the panache of having a child by the infant prodigy of the day. I was appalled by the situation when it arose, and the more so by the way that HG handled it... I felt I had to make every sacrifice to compensate to you for the suffering you might undergo. It was no difficulty to make these sacrifices because I loved you very much.\"",

      "body": "<p>Having made mincemeat of love and war since the earliest days of cinema, Hollywood has finally managed to give murder a bad name. And not just murder, but its hitherto cine-friendly country cousin, serial killing. What began so well with Psycho reaches its nadir this month with the release of American Psycho, and not since cheese has a word's intrinsic value suffered so badly at the hands of the prefix \"American\". Not that American Psycho is bad because it's tasteless, wrong, shocking or anything like that. If only. There are only two deaths worth weeping for in this movie. The slaughter of a perfectly decent book and the abduction and cold execution of an otherwise noble genre, the serial killer movie. </p> <p>The real tragedy of the summer, and God help us probably the year's most controversial film, is that it's just awful. Where Norman Bates had a mother, Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman has little more than his own expensive reflection to blame. Inevitably, the nuances of Easton Ellis' novel are blunted somewhat by the transition to celluloid, but it's a shame that any surviving traces are snow-washed out of existence by what in the end is a daft 80s musical, played for laughs yet somehow devoid of humour (it should hit the West End sometime soon as Bluddy, or The Demon Barber Of Wall Street.) </p> <p>Statistically, most serial killers are white heterosexual men in their 30s. A demographic they share with movie executives, who on the strength of this, are shaping up to be the greater menace. But then I would say that. I am exactly the kind of person that Patrick Bateman despises. I live in the city and I just don't give a monkey's about you, move right along the platform, you freaks. I simply couldn't care less. Truth is, me and my empty heart probably deserve to die. I'd just like to see some decent movies first. But the real shame here is the loss of cool to the killer. As the splendid history of the screen serial assassin teaches us, there's more to a good maniac than tailored shoes and an expensive-looking axe. </p> <p>Let's take music. In some of the film's better scenes, Bale's psycho shows us just how nuts he is by listening to Huey Lewis, Talking Heads, and not just Phil Collins but the song Sussudio. All very funny, but all this tells us is that our (anti) hero is a dick. This is hardly the Beethoven of young Alex in the recently resurrected Clockwork Orange. Nor is it Peter And The Wolf as whistled by Peter Lorre as the child murderer in Fritz Lang's M. The last time you hear him blow that tune is benchmark horror. Each time Bateman reaches for another CD, you just want to kill him. </p> <p>Inevitably, the screen slayer against whom all others must be judged is Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter. An astonishing creation that, let's face it, we've all come to love. But The Silence Of The Lambs has a curious subtext in terms of our response to killers, visible in the differences between the habits and fates of Lecter and Buffalo Bill. The message seems to be this: speak with a European accent, dress well, exhibit unnatural intelligence and you eat who you like. Keep women in pits, run around with your testicles wedged between your legs in a house full of moths and you must die like a dog. Funny, ain't it. In terms of people doing really out-of-order, degrading things for truly mad reasons, the award goes to Kevin Spacey's John Doe in Seven. Not only does he keep a man half-starved and on the very margins of death for an entire year, but he does it to prove what a dumbass Brad Pitt is. Now that's killin'. </p> <p>The idea of serial killer as malevolent genius with a good sense of humour reached an apex in the 80s with The Hitcher. Here, an all-powerful euro sophisticate (Rutger Hauer) dupes a confused American teenager by killing everyone around him, and wins our affections by placing the severed finger of the boy's dead girlfriend in a bag of chips. Pure class. While American Psycho as first-person narrative cannot access the suspenseful whodunnit heights of Seven, it somehow sidesteps the potential of its own content (having omitted the worst/best excesses of the novel), and so broaches the concept of non-horrific horror, murder-lite.</p> <p>For many of us, the first taste of true screen serial slaughter came with the supremely ugly couplet of 70s \"mad family\" movies, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes. Both traded on the (strangely plausible) notion that there are groups of people out there who, if you break down near their shack/caravan, will hunt you down and eat you alive for no reason. Both employ deformed offspring (Leatherface and Jupiter respectively) as engines of senseless death, and both trade on the fact that everyone grows up near an area where other children insist that such things actually happen, and both as a result are duly fearful. </p> <p>In recent years, two films have notably explored serial murder in such a way as to make us examine why it generally makes for such damned fine viewing. Tellingly, both accomplish this by making us uncomfortable about watching pain and death as opposed to making the deaths look painful for the slain. 1989's Henry, Portrait Of A Serial Killer did exactly what it said on the tin, by showing us the horrible basics of going around eating people and how your mates get roped in for the ride. More shocking still is Michael Henke's Funny Games, in which two German youths in tennis shorts and surgical gloves torture a German couple beyond the limits of visual endurance simply because they wouldn't lend them some eggs. Meantime, Bateman's crazed tidiness is a relief when viewed against Henry's attitude to bodies, which mirrors most students' approach to washing up. But however well-presented Bateman is, he lacks the sinister nerd chic of Henke's killers. And despite his Wall Street existence he is bereft of even the cold media savvy of hick supreme and walking apocalypse Mickey Knox from Natural Born Killers. \"Killing you and what you represent is a statement,\" says Mickey, \"I'm not exactly sure what it's saying but\u0083\" </p> <p>There are clear lessons here for anyone figuring on redeeming the genre from the fallout of this latest dud. Choose your homicidal wingnut wisely. Killing people is bad on its own, making your killer a pain in the ass on every other level is unlikely to help. Particularly if the goon makes it to the end of the picture. Bad serial killer movies serve to remind us of just one thing. If once in a while these people felt suicidal then they might be less of a problem. There is a school of thought in psychiatry that anger, and by association murder, takes place because people's expectations of one another are just too high. We should be grateful that frustrated expectations of films don't affect us the same way. There would be none of us left. As Bateman says at the end of the movie, \"this confession has been a waste of time\". You can say that again. \u0095 American Psycho is released on Friday</p>",

At 12.26 yesterday, when the jury forewoman said \"guilty\" in a voice broken by nerves, Britain's most notorious villain stared ahead at the judge in court two, his hands clasped in front of him. He was expressionless.</p> <p>On a previous occasion at the Old Bailey, he told a jury that had convicted him: \"I hope you die of cancer.\"</p> <p>Yesterday Noye, one of the most powerful and clever criminals of his generation, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Stephen Cameron, a 21-year-old electrician he stabbed to death in a pointless road-rage row.</p> <p>It was the climax to an extraordinary two-week trial that put the criminal justice system under severe pressure.</p> <p>Noye claimed he could not get a fair trial for the murder because of his reputation. It was this \"reputation\" as a ruthless underworld boss which led the judge, Lord Justice Latham, to give the 12 jurors 24-hour police protection. They did not have to read their names out in court, as is normal.</p> <p>The verdict was also vindication for Kent police, who mounted their biggest-ever operation to trace Noye and bring him back from Spain, where he fled within 24 hours of the stabbing, and for the crown prosecution service, which ignored Noye's repeated attempts to scupper proceedings by claiming abuse of process.</p> <p>Detective Superintendent Dennis McGookin, who led the investigation, said: \"Kenneth Noye ran, but he couldn't hide.\"</p> <p>Although the judge did not set a tariff yesterday, Noye is unlikely to be freed until he is a very old man.</p> <p>As he prepared to be led to the cells, the silence and tension was shattered by cheers from Stephen Cameron's parents, Ken and Toni, who were sitting behind him at the back of the court.</p> <p>They had heard Noye admit stabbing Stephen in the heart and liver. He claimed their son had started the fight at the Swanley interchange of the M25 on May 19 1996.</p> <p>At no point in the 12-day trial did they hear Noye apologise or show remorse. Nor had he expressed any sympathy for Cameron's fiance, Danielle Cable.</p> <p>Noye was acquitted of another murder 15 years ago claiming self defence, just as he had in this trial. Detective Constable John Fordham was stabbed 10 times when Noye found him hiding in his garden, attempting undercover surveillance.</p> <p>The officer's former partner, Neil Murphy, said yesterday: \"Justice has been done. Noye is a dangerous and evil man.\"</p> <p>One phrase cropped up in both murder trials. Noye, the pathologists said, had thrust the knife into his victims \"up to the hilt\".</p> <p>Yesterday the jury returned an 11-to-one majority decision after eight hours and 21 minutes of deliberations.</p> <p>They concluded Noye had lied about what happened when he got out of his Land Rover Discovery to confront Cameron, the passenger in a red Rascal van driven by Ms Cable.</p> <p>He claimed Cameron had attacked him in a \"wild rage\", adding that he only carried a four-inch knife because he was in fear of his life.</p> <p>The police \"detested\" him because of what had happened to DC Fordham. His conviction in 1986 for dishonestly handling gold from the Brink's-Mat bullion robbery - which led to his outburst at the jury - had made him a target for other gangsters who thought he knew where the gold was hoarded.</p> <p>The jurors believed the evidence of witnesses who saw Noye throw the first punch, and then get more than he bargained for from the younger, fitter man.</p> <p>Alan Decabral remembered seeing Noye take a step backwards and reach into his pocket. \"Then I saw a flash. I could see the sun glinting on the blade. He then made a run at the younger man.</p> <p>\"The older man stabbed him in the chest. I saw him stab him.\"</p> <p>Cameron's last words to Ms Cable as she cradled him in her arms were: \"He stabbed me, Dan. Take his number plate.\"</p> <p>During the extradition hearings Noye denied even being at the scene.</p> <p>After the verdict, the Camerons said they were \"overjoyed and relieved\". Shortly before they addressed a press conference, the sirens of a police convoy wailed out side. It was Noye being taken to Belmarsh prison.</p> <p>\"The day that Stephen died, we felt we died,\" said Mr Cameron, 53. \"It's only our family and friends that have kept us going.\" Mrs Cameron, 54, added: \"Our lovely son is dead and our lives will never be the same again.\"</p> <p>The couple's thoughts were with their son's fiance, whose courage in flying to Spain in August 1998 to identify Noye as the killer was praised repeatedly.</p> <p>Ms Cable was not at the Old Bailey yesterday; she is living in a safe house under 24-hour protection. But she was told the verdict by phone.</p> <p>Mrs Cameron said: \"She's trying to get on with her life but until today she hasn't been able to.

      "bodyText": "This time around, Kenneth Noye kept his thoughts to himself. At 12.26 yesterday, when the jury forewoman said \"guilty\" in a voice broken by nerves, Britain's most notorious villain stared ahead at the judge in court two, his hands clasped in front of him. He was expressionless. On a previous occasion at the Old Bailey, he told a jury that had convicted him: \"I hope you die of cancer.\" Yesterday Noye, one of the most powerful and clever criminals of his generation, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Stephen Cameron, a 21-year-old electrician he stabbed to death in a pointless road-rage row. It was the climax to an extraordinary two-week trial that put the criminal justice system under severe pressure. Noye claimed he could not get a fair trial for the murder because of his reputation. It was this \"reputation\" as a ruthless underworld boss which led the judge, Lord Justice Latham, to give the 12 jurors 24-hour police protection. They did not have to read their names out in court, as is normal. The verdict was also vindication for Kent police, who mounted their biggest-ever operation to trace Noye and bring him back from Spain, where he fled within 24 hours of the stabbing, and for the crown prosecution service, which ignored Noye's repeated attempts to scupper proceedings by claiming abuse of process. Detective Superintendent Dennis McGookin, who led the investigation, said: \"Kenneth Noye ran, but he couldn't hide.\" Although the judge did not set a tariff yesterday, Noye is unlikely to be freed until he is a very old man. As he prepared to be led to the cells, the silence and tension was shattered by cheers from Stephen Cameron's parents, Ken and Toni, who were sitting behind him at the back of the court. They had heard Noye admit stabbing Stephen in the heart and liver. He claimed their son had started the fight at the Swanley interchange of the M25 on May 19 1996. At no point in the 12-day trial did they hear Noye apologise or show remorse. Nor had he expressed any sympathy for Cameron's fiance, Danielle Cable. Noye was acquitted of another murder 15 years ago claiming self defence, just as he had in this trial. Detective Constable John Fordham was stabbed 10 times when Noye found him hiding in his garden, attempting undercover surveillance. The officer's former partner, Neil Murphy, said yesterday: \"Justice has been done. Noye is a dangerous and evil man.\" One phrase cropped up in both murder trials. Noye, the pathologists said, had thrust the knife into his victims \"up to the hilt\". Yesterday the jury returned an 11-to-one majority decision after eight hours and 21 minutes of deliberations. They concluded Noye had lied about what happened when he got out of his Land Rover Discovery to confront Cameron, the passenger in a red Rascal van driven by Ms Cable. He claimed Cameron had attacked him in a \"wild rage\", adding that he only carried a four-inch knife because he was in fear of his life. The police \"detested\" him because of what had happened to DC Fordham. His conviction in 1986 for dishonestly handling gold from the Brink's-Mat bullion robbery - which led to his outburst at the jury - had made him a target for other gangsters who thought he knew where the gold was hoarded. The jurors believed the evidence of witnesses who saw Noye throw the first punch, and then get more than he bargained for from the younger, fitter man. Alan Decabral remembered seeing Noye take a step backwards and reach into his pocket. \"Then I saw a flash. I could see the sun glinting on the blade. He then made a run at the younger man. \"The older man stabbed him in the chest. I saw him stab him.\" Cameron's last words to Ms Cable as she cradled him in her arms were: \"He stabbed me, Dan. Take his number plate.\" During the extradition hearings Noye denied even being at the scene. After the verdict, the Camerons said they were \"overjoyed and relieved\". Shortly before they addressed a press conference, the sirens of a police convoy wailed out side. It was Noye being taken to Belmarsh prison. \"The day that Stephen died, we felt we died,\" said Mr Cameron, 53. \"It's only our family and friends that have kept us going.\" Mrs Cameron, 54, added: \"Our lovely son is dead and our lives will never be the same again.\" The couple's thoughts were with their son's fiance, whose courage in flying to Spain in August 1998 to identify Noye as the killer was praised repeatedly. Ms Cable was not at the Old Bailey yesterday; she is living in a safe house under 24-hour protection. But she was told the verdict by phone. Mrs Cameron said: \"She's trying to get on with her life but until today she hasn't been able to. She has been an inspiration to us.\" The search \u0095 4,936 calls made to police incident room at Dartford \u0095 5,477 inquiries completed \u0095 1,314 statements taken \u0095 854 Land Rover Discoveries traced and eliminated \u0095 70 police officers worked on inquiry at its height \u0095 69 men named Anthony Francis - in whose name the Land Rover Noye was driving was registered -traced and eliminated \u0095 Police visited Cyprus, Canary Islands, Spain, Gibraltar, West Indies, Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the US",
