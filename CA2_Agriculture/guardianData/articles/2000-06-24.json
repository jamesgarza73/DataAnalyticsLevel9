      "body": "<p>The shirts look a paler blue than usual but there is still a rich hue to these Azzurri. Italy came to Euro 2000 with few fancying them to achieve anything significant but now, first-half goals by Francesco Totti and Filippo Inzaghi having swept them into the semi-finals last night, they will fancy themselves against Holland or Yugoslavia in Amsterdam on Thursday. </p> <p>Their passage was aided when the Romanians - but a silhouette of the side that ran England ragged to qualify for the last eight, the Italians never allowing them the same freedom to create - were reduced to 10 men with the dubious 58th-minute dismissal of their talisman Gheorghe Hagi. Having already been booked for a foul that saw Antonio Conte carried off on a stretcher, minutes later he was deemed to have dived under challenge from Gianluca Zambrotta and the referee, Vitor Melo Pereira of Portugal, brandished a second yellow card. </p> <p>Television replays showed that Zambrotta had indeed tugged Hagi as he closed on goal but the theatrics had harmed the Romanian's case. Hagi railed and raged against the injustice but there was no going back. It was a poignant way for one of the great international careers to end, Hagi - the Maradona of the Carpathians - having announced his retirement at the age of 35. </p> <p>He was only just back after suspension - he was missing against England. In the manner of Samson shorn of his strength, he was shaven-headed, as promised if his team-mates won that match, but he was clearly not chastened. He had also been sent off for Galatasaray in the Uefa Cup final against Arsenal, to be followed by yellow cards in the first two games of this tournament. There is rage within him at the dying of the light. </p> <p>As he failed to go gently into this good night, with him went any faint hopes that Romania might recover the deficit. They weren't playing England, after all. The Italians never subsequently looked likely to surrender their lead. For this is a traditional, back-to-basics Italy team, based on their traditional strengths of sound, solid defending, industrious midfield play and the odd moment of inspiration in attack. </p> <p>Injuries before the tournament to their first-choice goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and the \u00a323 million striker Christian Vieri almost seem to have helped bond them in adversity. </p> <p>It showed even in their attitude during their national anthem, the Fratelli D'Italia, as they linked arms. They were Italian brothers indeed. </p> <p>By contrast, the Romanians grew frustrated at being confronted this time by a less porous side and ended the match dispirited.

      "bodyText": "The shirts look a paler blue than usual but there is still a rich hue to these Azzurri. Italy came to Euro 2000 with few fancying them to achieve anything significant but now, first-half goals by Francesco Totti and Filippo Inzaghi having swept them into the semi-finals last night, they will fancy themselves against Holland or Yugoslavia in Amsterdam on Thursday. Their passage was aided when the Romanians - but a silhouette of the side that ran England ragged to qualify for the last eight, the Italians never allowing them the same freedom to create - were reduced to 10 men with the dubious 58th-minute dismissal of their talisman Gheorghe Hagi. Having already been booked for a foul that saw Antonio Conte carried off on a stretcher, minutes later he was deemed to have dived under challenge from Gianluca Zambrotta and the referee, Vitor Melo Pereira of Portugal, brandished a second yellow card. Television replays showed that Zambrotta had indeed tugged Hagi as he closed on goal but the theatrics had harmed the Romanian's case. Hagi railed and raged against the injustice but there was no going back. It was a poignant way for one of the great international careers to end, Hagi - the Maradona of the Carpathians - having announced his retirement at the age of 35. He was only just back after suspension - he was missing against England. In the manner of Samson shorn of his strength, he was shaven-headed, as promised if his team-mates won that match, but he was clearly not chastened. He had also been sent off for Galatasaray in the Uefa Cup final against Arsenal, to be followed by yellow cards in the first two games of this tournament. There is rage within him at the dying of the light. As he failed to go gently into this good night, with him went any faint hopes that Romania might recover the deficit. They weren't playing England, after all. The Italians never subsequently looked likely to surrender their lead. For this is a traditional, back-to-basics Italy team, based on their traditional strengths of sound, solid defending, industrious midfield play and the odd moment of inspiration in attack. Injuries before the tournament to their first-choice goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and the \u00a323 million striker Christian Vieri almost seem to have helped bond them in adversity. It showed even in their attitude during their national anthem, the Fratelli D'Italia, as they linked arms. They were Italian brothers indeed. By contrast, the Romanians grew frustrated at being confronted this time by a less porous side and ended the match dispirited. Though they had some moments of touch and promise from Hagi, the absence of the injured Gica Popescu and three suspended players, including Dan Petrescu, proved too much for them. Had Inzaghi's finishing been sharper, they might even have been more soundly beaten. The erratic Juventus striker wasted a good through ball by Totti - preferred to Alessandro Del Piero in the starting line-up - early on by shooting wide and in the second half did similarly when well placed to wrap up proceedings. Fortunately for Italy, the chance to unlock what was initially a cagey, staccato match fell to Totti. From Demetrio Albertini's free-kick on the right, Paolo Maldini headed back across goal, a weak clearance then falling for Stefano Fiore to clip the ball back into the penalty area for Totti, having stolen space, to guide past Bogdag Stelea. It was the goal the game needed to spark it into life. Soon after, Constantin Galca sprayed a ball wide to Hagi wide on the right and Francesco Toldo, making probably his first error of judgement of the tournament, rushed from his line, only to see Hagi's shot, a rare right-footer, bounce gently off a post before being cleared by Mark Iuliano.

Garland's biographer, George Clarke, whose book is to be published in the UK in November, said: 'Sid is a charmer, but he always has his eye out for his next chance to make a dollar.' Garland's life spiralled out of control after they split. Addicted to uppers and downers, she married and remarried within three years. Most of her money was taken by the taxman, who also seized her home. For the 16-year-old who enchanted the world, it was a yellow brick road to tragedy.",

      "body": "<p>He's 70 next month, and on 5 July he is to become a Sir, at a ceremony in Edinburgh's Holyrood Palace. So brace yourselves yet again for the Annual Sean Connery Celebrity Experience. You must know the routine by now. Supporter of Scottish independence. Possible new Bond film. Still 'World's Sexiest Man' (says some half-baked magazine poll). News of forthcoming movie starring an aspirant babe from somewhere around the middle of the Hollywood B-List. Stoutly refutes allegations of being a wife-beater... </p> <p>Yes, there's some grit in the whisky glass this time. In May, Scottish newspapers carried some quotes from Connery's first wife, Diane Cliento, contained in a forthcoming biography of the star by Geoffrey Wansell. In the book, she alleges that Connery badly beat her in a Spanish hotel room in 1965. Connery is considering whether to sue, but no action has been taken so far. Yet there has never been any denial of his public quotes about the legitimacy of hitting women, which Connery has sprinkled through his press record over the last 35 years. </p> <p>'To slap a woman is not the cruellest thing you can do to her,' he said in a Vanity Fair interview in 1993. Expect opportunist politicians and lazy commentators to raise this issue again, as Sir Sean bends the knee in a fortnight. But by far the most interesting aspect of Connery's biographical darkness is the way it feeds into his own film history - and into the highly charged politics of masculinity in modern movies. When the idea of the 'crisis of men' is one of the biggest cultural themes in the developed West (from Fight Club to American Psycho ), how do we assess a movie icon who stands, like no other, for 'real' manhood - with all the dangers that implies? In short, at the beginning of a hopeful new century, is it time to release ourselves from the sulphurous spell of his Bond-age, and say: Connery no more? </p> <p>He'll have to be forced, because he doesn't seem to be willing to give up on his own account. With three movies currently in development or being completed (Gus Van Sant's Finding Forrester , a spy thriller called End Game , and a remake of Graham Greene's The Quiet American ), retirement seems to be the last thing on his mind. But we don't need to wait for any more evidence of the desuetude of Connery's art. All we need to do is to look at his successors. With them we can see how things can progress - from a man who thinks 'there are women who take it to the wire', that look for 'the ultimate confrontation', to men who confront their own maleness, as much as their women. </p> <p>Modern action heroes such as Nicolas Cage or Tom Cruise cruelly show up Connery's limitations. Connery has always does the masterful official well - spies, kings, dragons, wizards, grizzled elder cops. In this he links back to the classic era of Gable and Wayne, Tracey and Bogart. These were straight-up, authoritative guys, efficiently doing some 'tricks' for the camera - same accent, same face, every time. Acting was something done in between improving the golf handicap, and hobnobbing with power \u00e9lites. But Connery shows few signs of the troubled male self-questioning that makes contemporary stars like Cage or Cruise so compelling, no matter their genre. </p> <p>When Cage unravels himself in Leaving Las Vegas, or Cruise howls his impotence in Born on the Fourth of July , you see actors fully aware of how complex screen manhood must be these days, to be even remotely credible. Their 'action-and-adventure' movies always bear the trace memory of these experiments - their utter 'inaction', the weakness of their wills. Who can look at Cruise's implacable face in Mission Impossible 2, without recalling his recent psychological extremes: the sleazoid sex instructor in Magnolia, or the doomed doctor in Eyes Wide Shut? </p> <p>Connery has always moaned about how he 'wanted to kill that Bond', shrug off the bullet-proof tuxedo and show the full range of his talents. But his choice of films belie him. Apart from a few forays into art-moviedom in the Sixties and Seventies (his sex-offending policeman in 1972's The Offence being the most notable success), and his celibate monk in 1986's The Name of the Rose, Connery has always crunched straight down the gravel-path of unambiguous masculinity. And in his later years, rather like his old drinking buddy Michael Caine, the choices have got worse (and his box-office commensurately bigger). </p> <p>Particularly after Highlander in 1986 - where he waved a sword around with much mystical verve - the older Connery seemed to have lucked into a new iconicity: the Celtic Patriarch. Connery can be an Irish cop in The Untouchables, an Oxford archeologist in Indiana Jones, a Russian submarine captain in The Hunt for Red October, a tweedy academic in The Russia House, a vigilante cop in Rising Sun, a Harvard lawyer in Just Cause - or (wait for it) a crinkly diamond thief in last year's Entrapment. </p> <p>But the context rarely matters these days: the performance is always the same. Connery makes his cash from peddling a kind of mid-century incorrigibility, a source-code maleness. As an off-the-shelf star property, Sean still seems to solve a lot of problems for a lot of people. </p> <p>Directors looking for some anchor to their dodgy scripts; movie fans who've surfed their satellite channels and have a taste for some living memories; weary men and women who want a brief respite from the never-ending story of sexual redefinition. And when Sean pulls on that white spiky toup\u00e9e he's worn for the last few action movies, trims up the beard and straps in the gut, you have to admit that he looks like a citizen with some seniority about him. But the presence of Connery on our screens has now become a bore, an automatic reflex among casting directors that they really should begin to resist. Connery is an unreconstructed male icon, at a time when the new constructions are getting more complex, and more interesting, by the day. </p> <p>Run through the members of the New Adonii - Jude Law, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ralph Fiennes, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon - and you have probably the most beautiful, sparkling, febrile clutch of male stars in screen history. It's a demand-driven thing. The modern female consumer mostly wants her male icon as a toy, not a rock. In a genderquake, rocks tend to split and crumble, or even explode dangerously. Toys you can stick in your pocket, easily replaced when they get damaged, or begin to dissatisfy. </p> <p>Even George Clooney - who's positioned somewhat higher up the machismo graph than this bunch - has an essentially non-threatening core to him. You can cake him in Iraqi dust, duet him with Quentin Tarantino, or cast him as Frank Sinatra in the Rat Pack: but he will always be the guy who was great with the terminally ill kids in ER . </p> <p>Connery's deepest connotations are, like it or not, the cold and steely sexisms of the Bond films. Watch them again, as this new century picks up speed, and you'll want to push the cultural accelerator to the floor (unless, that is, you're still a fully paid-up Loaded lad). Did men really loathe women so much then? Has there even been a more humped-and-dumped, silenced-and-ignored, slapped-and-strangled sequence of screen females than the Bond girls? </p> <p>It would be wrong to say that the kind of anti-modern masculinity Connery represents has no market any more. There's a lot of anxious dreaming out there, especially among the male info-class - enough for Hollywood to dig down deep into its bag for some of its oldest tricks. For example, Russell Crowe has everything necessary to assume full Conneryhood. The brick-shithouse physical presence. The roughneck post-colonial identity (Scotland or Australia: pick your global backwater). The biographical hints of bad temper and real violence: brawling outside hometown bars, intimidating wussy co-stars on set. </p> <p>And it's impossible to watch Gladiator without imagining the young, ex-body builder Connery slicing his way through all those corpses. But like those not-quite-real crowds in that not-quite-real coliseum, fighting those not-too-convincing lions and tigers, there's something not-at-all-believable about this vision of masculinity - heroically violent, passionately patriarchal - making any kind of a comeback. </p> <p>This is gender tourism, for women as well as men: a virtual-reality experience, where it all seems charged and powerful - until you take the Roman helmet off. You could almost call the experience, with a small c, a kind of connery. Take it as a new word - referring to a fake and bogus machismo, a compensatory sexist pleasure, for modern people too wise and weathered to take it seriously. And delivered with a dark, testosteronal growl that, to these faintly regretful ears, just isn't needed any more. Goodbye, Sir Sean (enjoy the gong). But we're shaken and stirred no more. </p> <p>\u0095 Finding Forrester, directed by Gus Van Sant, is out next year</p>",

And what actor is going to turn down playing a character who we all know is a 'sex machine with all the chicks'? </p> <p>But the original Shaft was the product of a very particular moment in American history, and had a social significance that far outweighed its importance in strictly cinematic terms. The new film, starring Samuel L. Jackson, has survived a troubled genesis to rise to the top of the US box-office charts. But the 2000 version of Shaft has a different meaning - and possibly a very different type of audience - from the original. </p> <p> Shaft came out in 1971, a particularly turbulent time in black American history. The civil rights movement had given black Americans equal legal status at last, which in time would lead to mainstream political representation, a growing middle class and a substantial media presence. However, civil rights had failed to end racism, the Black Panthers were in bloody decline, the decay of the traditional manufacturing base - which hit black Americans hardest - had begun, and there was a heroin crisis in the inner cities. </p> <p>In that context, films like Shaft meant more than their basic crime narratives would suggest. Blaxploitation movies were born of the same rage that fuelled the civil rights movement, born of a wish to shake things up. </p> <p> Shaft wasn't the first film in this upsurge. According to how you define it, that was either Ossie Davis's Cotton Comes To Harlem or Melvin Van Peebles's Sweet Sweetback's Badasssss Song (both 1970). And it's not the most typical: as blaxploitation films go, it's on the respectable side. John Shaft is a fairly traditional private detective, unlike the pusher and pimp anti-heroes of Superfly or The Mack. And while many of the later films were made by veteran white exploitation hacks, Shaft was directed by the distinguished photographer/writer/musician Gordon Parks (not to be confused with his son, Superfly 's Gordon Parks Jr). </p> <p>But Shaft was the most successful blaxploitation movie. It had Isaac Hayes's great soundtrack, which won an Oscar for the theme song. It had a whole array of white bad guys, from mobsters to corrupt cops. And it had Richard Roundtree as Shaft, looking impeccably sharp with his Afro and long, leather coat. In his book Hip Hop America , Nelson George ascribes the enduring appeal of blaxploitation films to their depiction of 'aggressive black heroism'. That's all there in the opening sequence to Shaft , as Roundtree strides fearlessly through the Manhattan traffic, raising his middle finger to a cabbie who dares question his right to the roads. </p> <p>George writes: 'Never in the history of American cinema had there been so many aggressive, I-don't-give-a-damn black folks on screen. That is so crucial. Blaxploitation movies reserved little space for the singing of Negro spirituals, turning the other cheek, or chaste kisses. In fact, characters who possessed these qualities were often the brunt of much-appreciated derision. In blax ploitation, black people shoot back with big guns, strut to bold jams, and have sweaty, bed-rocking sex. Whatever story the often loopy plots hold, they are usually secondary to full-bodied action.' </p> <p>Before then, blacks had a sketchy presence in mainstream movies, making do with whatever roles were on offer to Harry Belafonte, Sammy Davis Jr and Sidney Poitier. And although Poitier made some fine films and many courageous stands, his appearance in the absurd Guess Who's Coming To Dinner in 1967 made him look like a man out of time, cinema's Uncle Tom. After Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali, the mood was ripe for something different. </p> <p>The blaxploitation tornado had blown itself out by about 1976. There were two lousy Shaft sequels and a TV series. But blaxploitation has never drifted into the cultural wilderness, not least because, however vari able the films were, the music - by the likes of James Brown, Curtis Mayfield and Bobby Womack - was usually unbeatable. </p> <p>Director John Singleton grew up in the hip hop era. His first and by far best film - Boyz N The Hood - took its name from an Eazy E track. He's always used rappers in the cast: Busta Rhymes is in Shaft. But his obsession with Shaft predates even that: he claims he first saw it when he was three. </p> <p>In the mid-Nineties he came up with the idea of doing a film about Shaft's son. He wanted to do it on a low budget, with the energy and sexual brazenness of a hip hop video, and wanted Don Cheadle to star. But MGM, who owned the Shaft franchise, didn't like the idea. So although Singleton directed the new Shaft, it's a long way from his initial vision. Notorious producer Scott Rudin deemed the excellent Cheadle not famous enough: Jackson was brought in. Since the 51-year-old Jackson is only six years younger than Roundtree, he became Shaft's nephew rather than his son. </p> <p>The whole film became much more expensive. Along the way it lost the pulpiness and sexiness that Singleton had wanted: the result is a competent modern action movie with none of the retro gestures of Pulp Fiction and a lack of bedroom action that left Jackson feeling short-changed. Its cop turned vigilante storyline has its roots less in the first Shaft and more in Dirty Harry. </p> <p>There are endless stories of trouble on set: Singleton fighting with Jackson, Singleton spending too much time in his trailer with extras and both Singleton and Jackson arguing with Rudin and uniting in contempt for writer Richard Price, a fine novelist who has done plenty of screenwriting ( Sea Of Love, Ransom ). At a press conference Jackson referred to Price as 'that white man'. Even so, Price supplied the obligatory rich white bad guy (Christian Bale) and corrupt white cops, as well as one sympathetic white woman (Toni Collette). </p> <p>The first Shaft had one intended audience: hip young black men. The new film has at least three potential audiences. The first are people who just want to see an action movie: these are the people Rudin thinks have heard of Jackson but not Cheadle. The second are the sons of the guys who were so inspired by the first Shaft : they should be pleased to see that for once Jackson doesn't have to share the limelight with John Travolta or Geena Davis or Kevin Spacey. And the third, possibly most important, group are the white suburban teenagers who in their millions buy hardcore hip hop records by the likes of Wu Tang Clan and Dr Dre. If there is one thing the music business learnt during the Nineties, it was that you didn't have to tone down hip hop for it to cross over. </p> <p>But this special kind of crossover only works if the kids don't think the records or clothes are aimed at them. They want the real thing, the thing that's big in the South Bronx or Atlanta. And that's the awkward position that Shaft occupies: it is a big summer movie, but it can't be too much like any big summer movie. Jackson's shaved head gleams from the cover of both Entertainment Weekly and Rap Pages . So far, that tightrope walk seems to have worked. But however much money it takes, Singleton's film won't mean as much as Parks's did. The world has changed. </p> <p>Also bobbling about the US box-office chart right now is Big Momma's House , a massively unsubtle comedy starring Martin Lawrence.

Then there are plenty of crude comedies starring rappers, and black crime films like Hype Williams's sporadically brilliant Belly . Which is to say that Roundtree stepped into a near vacuum, offering something never seen before. Whereas the new Shaft exists in a world where the idea of 'black movies' as a genre is - finally - becoming redundant. </p> <p><strong>Changing times: 30 years of black cinema</strong></p> <p><strong> 1970:</strong> The release of Cotton Comes to Harlem and Sweet Sweetback's Badasssss Song herald the start of the blaxploitation genre. </p> <p><strong> 1971:</strong> Shaft is first big-budget blaxploitation film.

      "bodyText": "There's no real mystery to why there's a new film around called Shaft. The chance to use Isaac Hayes's immortal theme tune would be temptation enough. The whole blaxploitation genre has had a vigorous afterlife: parodied in I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, sampled and referenced in hundreds of hip hop records and videos, and copiously paid tribute to by Quentin Tarantino. And what actor is going to turn down playing a character who we all know is a 'sex machine with all the chicks'? But the original Shaft was the product of a very particular moment in American history, and had a social significance that far outweighed its importance in strictly cinematic terms. The new film, starring Samuel L. Jackson, has survived a troubled genesis to rise to the top of the US box-office charts.

      "body": "<p>First, lastminute.com saw millions wiped off its share value. Then, boo.com flopped. Now the great e-slump has hit the biggest net name on the planet - Amazon. </p> <p>The crash, late on Friday, sent a chill through the internet chatrooms yesterday. Anxious cyber-investors, who have become rich quick backing the internet bubble, logged on and asked each other one question: how much worse will it get? </p> <p>Amazon, the online bookseller which started life in a Washington garage in 1994, became the internet's most visible star worth $30 billion (\u00a319bn). After Friday's feverish Wall Street trading it is worth barely half that. </p> <p>Its crash comes in the wake of a number of high-profile dotcom failures. The sector, which spawned waves of charismatic young entrepreneurs, is now eating its young alive. </p> <p>On Friday Amazon's share price plunged by 20 per cent as analysts took a closer look at the company's finances. Ravi Suria, a bond analyst with the Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers, issued a damning report which said: 'Amazon must be able to generate the cash-operating profile of a successful retailer. It is essentially this yardstick that we use to analyse the company, and as the rest of this report shows, we find it woefully lacking.' </p> <p>Suria concluded that the company's weak balance sheet showed the 'financial characteristics that have driven innumerable retailers to disaster throughout history'. </p> <p>Investors were quick to draw their own conclusions. Wall Street's most powerful analyst, Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, a champion of Amazon's stock last month, forecasted that the company's prospects now held 'little upside' over the coming months. Meeker said that the fourth quarter of this year would determine whether Amazon was a 'survivor' - hardly the description usually attached to a company whose share value was double that of British Airways. </p> <p>The influential internet investment team at Goldman Sachs has also expressed concern that the company will find the crucial months in the run up to Christmas difficult. </p> <p>Even Jeff Bezos, who founded the company and owns nearly 40 per cent of it, may have gone a little cold. He recently sold nearly 400,000 Amazon shares to buy a $7.5m (\u00a34.7m) apartment. </p> <p>Amazon's financial foundations look precarious. The company has raised more than $2.1bn (\u00a31.3bn) in convertible junk bonds through five separate placings. These pay little in the way of interest but, because they allow their holders to convert them into shares, they can prove attractive if the company's prospects look good. </p> <p>But Amazon, which last year made losses of $700m, has been running a 'burn rate' of more than $100m a month. Analysts now fear Amazon will run out of money. </p> <p>And, as its share price crashes, Amazon's ability to issue more convertible bonds is undermined, threatening its ability to bankroll its expansion plans. </p> <p>Amazon argues that much of the money it has raised through bond issues has been spent building the business's distribution network and will thus produce returns in the long run. But a recent investigation by the influential New York Observer newspaper concluded that barely half a billion dollars has been spent on investing in the company's distribution network. </p> <p>The rest of the cash raised has been spent simply on mopping up the company's cumulative losses - some $1.2bn since Amazon launched. As of March this year Amazon had just $84m in cash, a 30 per cent drop on the amount it had three months earlier. The New York Observer said the company's finances as 'simply appalling'. </p> <p>Analysts have had their fingers burnt by other recent dotcom disasters on both sides of the Atlantic. They look with horror at online music retailer CDNow. </p> <p>The US and London-based firm which has a similar business model to Amazon, was worth more than $2bn two years ago. The company is worth less than $100m now and needs a buyer. </p> <p>Since its launch in 1994 the company has lost more than $200m (\u00a3125m). Last Thursday CDNow's founder, Jason Olin, 31, closed the company's large London office. </p> <p>Similarly eToys, which was worth \u00a38bn two years ago, is now worth just $8bn.

      "bodyText": "First, lastminute.com saw millions wiped off its share value. Then, boo.com flopped. Now the great e-slump has hit the biggest net name on the planet - Amazon. The crash, late on Friday, sent a chill through the internet chatrooms yesterday. Anxious cyber-investors, who have become rich quick backing the internet bubble, logged on and asked each other one question: how much worse will it get? Amazon, the online bookseller which started life in a Washington garage in 1994, became the internet's most visible star worth $30 billion (\u00a319bn). After Friday's feverish Wall Street trading it is worth barely half that. Its crash comes in the wake of a number of high-profile dotcom failures. The sector, which spawned waves of charismatic young entrepreneurs, is now eating its young alive. On Friday Amazon's share price plunged by 20 per cent as analysts took a closer look at the company's finances. Ravi Suria, a bond analyst with the Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers, issued a damning report which said: 'Amazon must be able to generate the cash-operating profile of a successful retailer. It is essentially this yardstick that we use to analyse the company, and as the rest of this report shows, we find it woefully lacking.' Suria concluded that the company's weak balance sheet showed the 'financial characteristics that have driven innumerable retailers to disaster throughout history'. Investors were quick to draw their own conclusions. Wall Street's most powerful analyst, Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, a champion of Amazon's stock last month, forecasted that the company's prospects now held 'little upside' over the coming months. Meeker said that the fourth quarter of this year would determine whether Amazon was a 'survivor' - hardly the description usually attached to a company whose share value was double that of British Airways. The influential internet investment team at Goldman Sachs has also expressed concern that the company will find the crucial months in the run up to Christmas difficult. Even Jeff Bezos, who founded the company and owns nearly 40 per cent of it, may have gone a little cold. He recently sold nearly 400,000 Amazon shares to buy a $7.5m (\u00a34.7m) apartment. Amazon's financial foundations look precarious. The company has raised more than $2.1bn (\u00a31.3bn) in convertible junk bonds through five separate placings. These pay little in the way of interest but, because they allow their holders to convert them into shares, they can prove attractive if the company's prospects look good. But Amazon, which last year made losses of $700m, has been running a 'burn rate' of more than $100m a month. Analysts now fear Amazon will run out of money. And, as its share price crashes, Amazon's ability to issue more convertible bonds is undermined, threatening its ability to bankroll its expansion plans. Amazon argues that much of the money it has raised through bond issues has been spent building the business's distribution network and will thus produce returns in the long run. But a recent investigation by the influential New York Observer newspaper concluded that barely half a billion dollars has been spent on investing in the company's distribution network. The rest of the cash raised has been spent simply on mopping up the company's cumulative losses - some $1.2bn since Amazon launched. As of March this year Amazon had just $84m in cash, a 30 per cent drop on the amount it had three months earlier. The New York Observer said the company's finances as 'simply appalling'. Analysts have had their fingers burnt by other recent dotcom disasters on both sides of the Atlantic. They look with horror at online music retailer CDNow. The US and London-based firm which has a similar business model to Amazon, was worth more than $2bn two years ago. The company is worth less than $100m now and needs a buyer. Since its launch in 1994 the company has lost more than $200m (\u00a3125m). Last Thursday CDNow's founder, Jason Olin, 31, closed the company's large London office. Similarly eToys, which was worth \u00a38bn two years ago, is now worth just $8bn. Reel.com, the online video retailer, closed down earlier this month with the loss of 200 jobs and Petstore.com had to shut down and sell off its assets to a fellow retailer. The slump is so bad that investment house Barron's has started to compile a death row of e-commerce firms. Joining CDNow on the critical list are nine other high profile US start ups. Among Britain's home-grown start-ups the highly public demise of online sportswear retailer boo reinforces the argument that e-tailing is not a quick route to cash. Formed by two Swedes, Ernst Malmsten and ex-Vogue model Kajsa Leander, boo managed to spend $135m in under a year. After it crashed, the technology used to run boo's site was sold off for just \u00a3250,000.

At its heart is an investigation of the cult of the celebrity interview, and the novella's four characters do rather feel as though they were called into existence solely for the purpose of interrogating this theme. David Lodge says in his afterword that the business of converting play to prose fiction is a 'rather unusual literary project'; I'm not sure that here it has quite worked. </p> <p>Without living actors to breathe the dialogue into life - you can picture an actress having a particularly good time with the venomous Burchillian interviewer - Home Truths tends towards the flat promise of a script rather than the fully realised complexity of a three-dimensional fictional world. </p> <p> <strong> History in Our Time</strong><br>David Cannadine<br>Penguin \u00a38.99, pp313<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501005980,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>As the intrepid Nicholas Crane shrugs off his sodden rucksack in a bar in Ayrsgarth he discovers from a television that Princess Diana is dead.

On the evidence of this week's paperback round-up, then, the centrality of the princess to our culture today is little in dispute. </p> <p>Unsurprising, perhaps, that the jacket of Cannadine's book pictures the sea of floral tributes piled up outside Kensington Palace.

Saved by a farcical intervention of fate, she sets off instead to Spain to learn the art and vocabulary of the corrida, more theatre than sport, and to meet with people who face death every day for a living. </p> <p>Kennedy's familiar dry wit and striking prose make the subject entirely her own, and her observations are fresh because they are partly informed by the personal sorrow she lugs around Spain with her. </p> <p>\u0095 Jane Perry</p>",

As he walks down the street, some passers-by engage him in seemingly anodyne conversation. Until one of them sticks him in the hand with a hypodermic needle. When he wakes up, he is chained to the floor in a bare white room, beginning an ordeal of sexual violence at the hands of three masked women that is to last for 18 days. Thomson's coolly detached prose prevents his story from falling into the obvious trap of high-class pornography. But that same coolness is also responsible for a rather chilly aestheticism that prevents this novel from ever becoming truly engaging. Home Truths David Lodge Penguin \u00a35.99, pp 142 Buy it at BOL This novella actually started life as a play of the same name. At its heart is an investigation of the cult of the celebrity interview, and the novella's four characters do rather feel as though they were called into existence solely for the purpose of interrogating this theme. David Lodge says in his afterword that the business of converting play to prose fiction is a 'rather unusual literary project'; I'm not sure that here it has quite worked. Without living actors to breathe the dialogue into life - you can picture an actress having a particularly good time with the venomous Burchillian interviewer - Home Truths tends towards the flat promise of a script rather than the fully realised complexity of a three-dimensional fictional world. History in Our Time David Cannadine Penguin \u00a38.99, pp313 Buy it at BOL As the intrepid Nicholas Crane shrugs off his sodden rucksack in a bar in Ayrsgarth he discovers from a television that Princess Diana is dead. This same moment triggers the dramatic climax of Lodge's novella. And it's an equally dramatic moment - admittedly most of her moments are - for the Diana-worshipping Bridget Jones. On the evidence of this week's paperback round-up, then, the centrality of the princess to our culture today is little in dispute. Unsurprising, perhaps, that the jacket of Cannadine's book pictures the sea of floral tributes piled up outside Kensington Palace. He is an excellent guide to the Diana phenomenon in its historical context, and this sharply intelligent collection of essays finds room, happily, for many other twentieth-century figures as well. \u0095 Sophie Harrison On Bullfighting AL Kennedy Yellow Jersey Press \u00a35.99, pp180 Buy it at BOL This slim volume boasts possibly the most unexpected opening chapter of any sports book: novelist Alison Kennedy's frank account of her aborted suicide attempt. Though a novice to the subject of bullfighting when commissioned to write this book, Kennedy recognises it as the courting of death dressed up in ritual - death being a subject she had thought about a great deal during the period of depression and writer's block that preceded her decision to throw herself out of a fourth-floor window. Saved by a farcical intervention of fate, she sets off instead to Spain to learn the art and vocabulary of the corrida, more theatre than sport, and to meet with people who face death every day for a living. Kennedy's familiar dry wit and striking prose make the subject entirely her own, and her observations are fresh because they are partly informed by the personal sorrow she lugs around Spain with her. \u0095 Jane Perry",

      "body": "<p><strong> I. Family dinner</strong> </p> <p> My guinea-pig child, now 21, was home from college for the Christmas holidays. This child was not by temperament suited to be the unbuffered firstborn of a literary, free-thinking mother and an anxiety-prone father, the child of divorce, joint custody, and stepparenting. Her whole life she was a girl who liked things steady and predictable. Thus it came as a surprise to me when she disclosed her ideal family, the one she aims to have when she is the matriarch. The word she used was 'welcoming'. Should you want to be in her family, whoever you are, well, she is going to be happy to have you. Her house will have plenty of beds and plenty of dishes and plenty of congenial people sitting around discussing issues like women's health care and the third wave of feminism. I liked it. It sounded quite like the home she has grown up in, of which I have been the matriarch. </p> <p>The last night before my daughter went back to college, we had another one of those family dinners, you know, me, my boyfriend, his daughter and son by his second wife, my daughters by my second husband, and my seven-year-old son by my third husband. The topic of conversation was how my son came to walk home from school, more than a mile up a steep, winding road, on a very warm day. 'What did you do when cars went by?' I asked. 'I stepped to the side of the road!' he answered. He was laughing at the success of his exploit. Not only had he been a very bold boy who had accomplished something he had been wanting to do; he had been impressively disobedient. We all laughed, and my boyfriend and I squeezed each other's hands, pleased and seduced by that happy-family idea, everyone safe and well-fed, getting along, taken care of. </p> <p>But we are not married, and have no plans to blend our families. I come to the theory and practice of marriage at the start of the new millennium with a decidedly chequered past and an outsider's view. But, I admit, I'm still paying attention, implicated, at least, by the fact that my children assume they will get married. I see the same thing as many others do, the breakdown of the traditional family, but I don't see this as a dark and fearsome eventuality, rather as something interesting to observe, something that I have endured, survived, and actually benefited from, something that will certainly be part of the material from which my children build their lives. </p> <p> <strong> II. Children</strong> </p> <p> Capitalism has an excellent reputation, among fans of the free market, for disseminating goods and information and moulding the lives of consumers in the ways that best serve both the system and individuals. If this is indeed the case, then late capitalism has evidently decided that what is best for us and our children is serial monogamy, frequent changes of employment, and a high degree of instability. It has decided that, on balance, it is better for all adults to work rather than for one designated gender to stay home with the children. It has decided that most children will spend at least part of their childhoods in the care of people outside their families. It has decided that the individual's relationship to society will be less and less mediated through the family and more and more experienced directly. </p> <p>Fans of the free market would say that we should embrace rather than resist what capitalism has decided. Which is not to say that when, 16 years ago, I parted from the father of my two daughters, I wasn't traumatised. The choice of staying or leaving presented itself to me as a choice between suicide and mass murder. For years afterward, I secretly scrutinised the girls for signs of psychological damage, and I read, with sinking heart, every article in the news about the negative impact of divorce upon children. It wasn't until my son came along, the child of my next marriage, that I appreciated this gloriously cruel fact of life: had I not divorced my daughters' father, I would never have borne my son, and how could I do without any of the three of them? My daughters are 21 and 17 now, and they have spent many years contemplating their own family and the families of their friends, comparing and choosing and wishing. They have a network of siblings: a stepsister and stepbrother nearly their own age from their father's second marriage, a foster brother, also from that marriage, and a half brother, my son. Their stepsiblings have stepsiblings of their own, to whom my daughters feel related. All eight of these kids elect to maintain family ties with one another, ties that bind them more closely to one another than to their various stepparents. My daughters like the looseness of this and compare it favourably with the tightness of their friends' traditional families, which seem a little suffocating. And I have experienced the input of the stepparents and the stepsiblings as productive and enlightening. What I thought of as mass murder turned out to be freedom: freedom from the particular family pathology that the girls' father and I were monogamously building in our four-bedroom house on that corner lot in that state I now think of as Monogamy Central. </p> <p> <strong> III. Men</strong> </p> <p> Let's say that there is only one thing we know about men: that they feel a tension between monogamy and promiscuity. Let's further say that the balance of that tension is different in different men, and that it changes as the men age, sometimes from monogamy toward promiscuity and sometimes from promiscuity toward monogamy. If we accept as fact only this one thing about men, then any one marriage would be more or less likely to be unstable, while at the same time marriage as an institution would be a valuable social check upon the chaos of promiscuity. Men themselves would have a stake in promoting stability for others while trying to find some wiggle room for themselves. One thing that seems to be evident from history is that marriage as a property relationship is more stable than marriage as a personal relationship. It is not until women emerge from property status that the tension between monogamy and promiscuity is really a problem. It is women with voices and a certain amount of power who force men to choose between possible types of relationships. </p> <p>We can easily imagine a man having a mother, a housekeeper, a wife who has produced his legitimate children, a concubine, a sister, and even a female friend, all living under the same roof. The trouble is, we can't imagine him in the West. In America and Europe, custom requires that the mother and sister live elsewhere and all of the others be rolled into one, the wife. Wives require it, too. When courtship was about joining properties, then it could be short. Now that marriage is about being everything to one another, courtship takes a long time and can break down at any point. It is difficult to find a mate who is equally good at every function, and it is also difficult to know oneself well enough to know which function you care about more than the others. And then, of course, as the marriage project moves through its stages - householding, child-rearing, professional success, ageing - the functions you once cared about change or evolve. The great lover who can't manage to get a dirty dish into the dishwasher becomes more annoying than exciting, the wonderful friend who is infertile is a figure of tragedy, the terrific mother who harps about responsibility comes to seem like a nag. And that tension between monogamy and promiscuity remains, now transformed into a dilemma of character. The trouble with serial monogamy, which I define as being faithfully married to one person until you can't stand it any more, and then being faithfully married to another person who fits the new standard better, is that each transition in the series comes as a personal defeat. </p> <p>Serial infidelity is even worse, a strange combination of victory and defeat every time the husband cheats on his wife, until he is numb not only to the moral attractions of monogamy but also to the erotic attractions of promiscuity. Capitalism doesn't decide between the two simultaneous male drives toward promiscuity and monogamy but promotes both frenetically, knowing, like stockbrokers, that there is more money to be made by churning a portfolio than by holding on to it. It is for the men themselves to decide how expensive a great deal of change is, and whether the expense, in the end, is worth it. As late capitalism becomes later capitalism, the pressure toward individual change can only increase, since change generates wealth and circulates it too. But change also promotes learning and flexibility, at least for some. Those who learn often not only find mates who suit them but also find out how to value those mates. They begin to master the idea of relating, sharing, forgiving, taking responsibility. They begin to understand the relative merits of monogamy and promiscuity, even to forge new modes of relating that transcend the apparent split between the two. Whether they can fit these new modes into marriage remains, however, to be seen. </p> <p> <strong> IV. Fidelity</strong> </p> <p> Infidelity in marriage is a form of inattention. The spouse becomes less interesting than someone new, and the unfaithful party either isn't around much or seems distracted when he or she is. Some years ago, for example, a friend of mine had a breast biopsy. Her husband took her to the clinic on Thursday, stayed with her, brought her home, and tended to her that afternoon and evening. The next morning, when she was to go back for a check-up, he coolly suggested that their 16-year-old daughter could handle it and that the wife would be fine for the rest of the day by herself. It later turned out that he had prior plans to spend the day with his 25-year-old girlfriend and didn't want to change them. In the course of their bitter divorce, this callousness seemed particularly monstrous, the wife sitting home alone in pain and fear while the husband was cavorting with a woman 25 years his junior. Yes, he was a lout, but what if he had been able to treat both women with love and compassion, patience and tenderness? What if when he was with the wife he had been fully with her, and when he was with the girlfriend he had been fully with her? Would each have been satisfied? Could he, could anyone, have done that? </p> <p>When I began seeing my current boyfriend, he had another girlfriend, who was seeing another guy. Since the very thing that broke up my last marriage was my former husband's infidelity, it seemed to me that I was putting myself right back into danger, and so for a long time we refrained from identifying our relationship even as a 'relationship.' We were friends, then 'all-inclusive friends'. A turning point came about six months in, when the other girlfriend broke up with her other boyfriend and said to Jack, 'Well, I guess it's just you and me again,' and he said to her, 'Well, you, me, and Jane.' Within a few weeks, she had another boyfriend. Sometimes we would have dinner together, all four of us, but our dinners were, to say the least, volatile. Even so, all of the relationships, mine with him, his with her, hers with the other guy, endured, and not without pain and jealousy on the part of every single one of us. But we had a principle. We were not married, and, further, we didn't wish to take marriage as our paradigm. </p> <p>Couples in the West begin taking marriage as their paradigm almost as soon as they begin dating: going steady, exchanging rings, or whatever. It takes real conviction and unusual stubbornness to flout the paradigm, and I, for one, needed help to do so. More than anything, I wanted another marriage to close over my head like the surface of a vast sea, preventing the acquisition of any real understanding of myself, my sexuality, and my ways of relating to men. The other girlfriend and her very central place in the life of the man I loved prevented that, and her own refusal to allow her sexual freedom to be restricted offered a model of an alternative. Some men and women have the knack of being so delightfully present that time with them is worthwhile in and of itself, whether or not any promises about exclusiveness have been made. There are people in whom freedom is the very essence of their appeal, and those who love them have to make the choice: Is the desire to possess, in and of itself, more worth pursuing than the relationship with that delightful person, and if so, why? Or is that relationship, whatever it entails, the valuable thing? To be forced to ponder these questions is to be forced to ask yourself about your own freedom and autonomy, your own ability to be present with your friend or spouse when he is present with you as well as your ability to be present with yourself when he is not with you. One thing I have discovered is that I always mistook longing for love. If I felt enough longing, then that was the sure sign that this was love. The trouble was that I could feel longing for my friend when he was right there, in my arms, talking to me. If I got rid of the longing, then I didn't recognise what was left as love, and in fact it took me a long time to recognise love when I felt it. Not getting married was the education in learning not to be oblivious, but instead honest and observant. Fidelity, more than anything else, is the signifier of marriage. To forswear fidelity is to open yourself up to other ideas, other thoughts, about what love is, what desire is, what happiness is, and what commitment is. </p> <p> <strong> V. Feminism</strong> </p> <p> It was inevitable that women would rise out of property status. Capitalism wants every consumer, and ultimately distinctions among consumers according to gender, age, geographical location or ethnic background must break down as the market extends itself. Since marriage began as a property relationship, its foundations are challenged by the transformation of the property into personhood. True marriage, or remarriage, begins with the revelation that union between male and female is a divine reconciliation between equals. The rise of women, in my opinion, is a done deal. Even a huge cataclysm seems incapable of returning women to property status. </p> <p>Let's say that one thing is true about women: they know who their children are. The tension they feel is the tension between the claims of the self and the claims of the child, and once again the balance varies among individuals and over the course of a lifetime. The high fertility level of women suggests that nature favours culling rather than preselection as the mode of limiting the human population. In this, nature is like the free market, which is never merciful nor safe in the short term or to the individual. Free-market capitalism is very much like a large, vital ecosystem that balances itself over time by getting rid of this or that individual or group. As we proliferate, our value as units declines, and we have to enhance our value relative to others by offering a scarce talent, or else combining with others to share both the work and the wealth. The obvious course is to combine with men, the fathers of our children, as a way of avoiding the heartbreak of natural culling, but the success of feminism as an outgrowth of the free market requires the reconstitution of marriage so that both men and women benefit from it. At the turn of the millennium, that is where we find ourselves. </p> <p> <strong> VI. Sex</strong> </p> <p> Marriage as a property relationship organised sex very clearly. The transfer of property from one family to another, and then from one generation to another, gave primacy to the reproductive function of sex. Reproductive choice is one of the products of free-market capitalism that actually has been as revolutionary as advertised, and undoubtedly could have destroyed marriage as a property relationship all by itself, because the effect of reproductive choice is to promote desire as an end, and endless desire as the ultimate goal. More optimistic philosophers of capitalism view desire as a form of greed, perhaps the highest form of greed, and therefore the most profitable. Pessimistic philosophers of capitalism have other ideas: a form of infantilism (Freud), a biological urge, a sin, a weakness, a failure of will. People who get married tend to view it as a promise. </p> <p>The way someone defines desire determines its result. Defining it as hunger for something wanting, for example, dictates that it must be sated, especially in marriage; the best you can hope for is that tricks and brief deprivations will put off satiation temporarily. Some Hollywood movies, such as Casablanca, define it as a brief consummation preceded and followed by years of deprivation: the briefer the consummation, the more total the deprivation, the more perfect the experience of desire. Humphrey Bogart's last line to Claude Rains is spoken with relief: romantic deprivation is exactly what he has wanted all along. The alternative scenario, as in, for example, The Big Sleep, is that the couple will experience danger and potential deprivation, and their level of desire will thereby be enhanced beyond the power of permanent commitment to drain it off completely. The logical end of this line of thinking is Bonnie and Clyde or Natural Born Killers, the rapid alternation of sex and the threat of death climaxing in a shoot-out or the electric chair. In fact, for market capitalism, sex is like everything else - something to want when you don't have it and to not want when you do have it. This poses a problem for marriage based on personal relationship, especially since the fluctuating desires of two people need to be taken into account. The solution to the difficulties of marital sex offered by free-market capitalism is a lifetime of courtship, which, like all courtship, carries a high degree of cruelty. Not long ago I was at the beauty parlour, eavesdropping on a 70-year-old woman who, when the hairdresser asked if she had a boyfriend, said, 'Don't you know? At my age they say, \"If he's younger than you, he's after your purse, if he's older than you, he's after a nurse.\"' We all laughed, because we ruefully agreed. </p> <p>And yet courtship after 50 is illuminating in several ways. One of these grows out of the fact that the path from erection to ejaculation is neither as short nor as direct as it once was, thereby inviting both partners, but especially the man, to explore other, some cultures would say higher, modes of pleasure. Another grows out of the uncoupling of roles - neither partner is in the throes of choosing a career, defining an identity, or deciding whether and how to have children; the hopes and fears that impinge upon sexuality in one's twenties and thirties have become regrets or achievements, but at any rate are decided. Sexuality itself is less mysterious, more available for experimentation. Does endless desire result from relaxation? Comedian Chris Rock has said, 'A man is only as faithful as his options', and to that, greed, serial monogamy, and promiscuity would say, 'Amen!' Lifetime courtship is an option, though, not a requirement. Marital sex after 50 presents the same opportunities as extramarital sex, if the partners can deflect the definitions of desire that the market offers. </p> <p> <strong> VII. Intimacy</strong> </p> <p> We marry to make ourselves happy. In this we have the approval of both free-market capitalism and the signers of the Declaration of Independence, who chose 'the pursuit of happiness' rather than 'property' as the appropriate corollary to life and liberty. Nevertheless, when we marry we mostly don't know what will make us happy. Happiness is a multiple-choice test: steady companionship? lots of stuff? a nice place to live? children? plenty of sex? good health? freedom to do what we want? The free market offers one suggestion after another, and serial monogamy as well as serial infidelity can be seen as a method of sampling all the wares, all the theories about happiness. </p> <p>Capitalism has ordained diversity. I was Protestant-agnostic from St Louis. My first husband was Irish-Catholic from Wyoming. My second husband was Hungarian-Catholic from the Bronx. My third husband was Nordic-Baptist from Iowa. In every case, the things we knew unconsciously about how a family is constituted and what various verbal and physical signals meant sometimes agreed and sometimes disagreed. We often found ourselves misinterpreting, miscommunicating, feeling alone. Add to this the inherent communication differences between men and women, and intimacy seems an unlikely outcome. Our parents' wish that we marry within our faith and within our neighbourhood, seems, in retrospect, a practical alternative. The solution that capitalism offers is bargaining, and, indeed, we are often advised to become good negotiators in our relationships; that is, to communicate specifically and explicitly, to be fair in divvying up responsibilities, and to understand that relationships are like contracts. But bargaining in the home shares the limitations of bargaining in the marketplace. Advantage can be gained by being dishonest or secretive or by withholding a desired object. Bargaining also rewards the partners for soliciting third parties in deciding whether the agreement has been violated. A bargain can never truly be fair, and so it focuses the minds of the bargainers on inequities and betrayals. </p> <p>The first requirement of intimacy is honesty. Honesty between spouses is supremely difficult unless each spouse feels complete, because bargaining is about negotiating needs; that is, compensations for incompleteness. If the only reason to marry is to be happy, and happiness can result only from intimacy, then serial monogamy is the natural result of a strategy of bargaining as a way of divvying up marital responsibilities. </p> <p>Codependency is an interesting late-capitalist pathology that illuminates both intimacy and bargaining. The codependent is said to be someone who gives up an explicit bargain in favour of an implicit bargain. Instead of you taking care of me and me taking care of the children, say, or you bringing home the money and me taking care of the house, our bargain is, allegedly, that you act like my drunken father and I feel a sense of familiarity. Except that the codependent partners often don't consciously feel that such is the bargain they have made. Rather, they feel that they have committed themselves to each other, but problems of addiction, finances, illness, and temperament have made the commitment a troubled one. The instinct of the couple is to try harder to sustain the commitment, but their psychological advisers view this as the very sign that pathology is at work. If bargaining is the model, then they are right - good bargaining always strives for explicitness and fairness. If intimacy is the model, then something else is going on. Psychological professionals always say that codependents are avoiding intimacy, but, in fact, the partners actually have achieved a high level of intimacy, because they have confronted the inconveniences of each other and have chosen to accept them, rather than avoid them. The problem is not intimacy, per se, but each partner's sense of self. If the depredations of each partner had no negative effect, then the relationship would not be pathological but potentially transformative, rather like what happens when one spouse contracts a serious illness that puts both spouses to the test and brings them to new and deeper levels of intimacy. The most important requirement of recovery from addiction is absolute honesty, the most important requirement of intimacy, but, in the pantheon of self-serving virtues required by free-market capitalism, it is nowhere to be found. </p> <p> <strong> VIII. Money</strong> </p> <p> Divorce laws in the state of California, where I live, are absolute. Whatever property accrues to the partners in a marriage accrues to both and shall be divided equally by both, no matter who accrued it, who left, who broke the contract. The moral construction of the marriage bond has no legal weight, and very little bargaining is allowed. Perhaps these laws were intended to retard marital breakdown. In a model where the husband accrues the money, then discards the wife and children for a younger woman, possibly he might be given pause by the idea that it's cheaper to keep her. If the model is different, and, for example, the money was accrued by the wife, who bore the children and kept to the contract but the husband left her anyway for a younger woman, giving in to his inherent drive toward promiscuity, then the outcome is the same - halving of the property. In such a case, the departing male has no reason to maintain the marriage and every reason to leave it. He who came in with nothing leaves with quite a bit - an excellent deal. In the divorce culture, laws like those in the state of California serve as a disincentive to marriage, especially between people of disparate incomes. Serial monogamy turns out to be a way periodically to halve your assets. </p> <p>The free market, especially in the last 30 years, has decreed that disparate incomes shall be the norm. Those who have also have lawyers advising them on how to protect what they have against the intimate enemy, the potential future spouse, using the family trust, the prenuptial agreement. When I told my lawyer that my boyfriend was going to remodel my house, she advised me to get a strict estimate and regular billings, then to keep a record of the cheques I paid him with so that if we broke up he couldn't claim equity in the house and force me to sell it. In California, apparently, any type of affectional relationship is dangerous. Of course, the logical end to all of this is: every man a nomad, and every woman, too. And yet, as the baby-boom generation ages, the problem that faces Social Security faces individuals and families too. Who provides? When marriage was a property relationship and assets were concentrated in the hands of patriarchs, the answer was clear. Now, with assets circulating at an accelerated pace through an economy more and more in flux, customs regulating who pays and who is paid for have little time to take hold, while the selfishness and greed that are the default options of the system gain currency. Who pays for the children? Who pays for the men and women without pension plans? Who pays for the unlucky and the unwise? Greed and selfishness always say, not me! </p> <p> <strong> IX. Why are you married?</strong> </p> <p> I know quite a few people who support children not their own. I know some people who support children not even belonging to their spouses or mates. Why they would do so goes unanswered by both economics and sociobiology, and is explained only by invoking love or the common good. And free-market capitalism is a poor teacher when it comes to understanding love or the common good. Traditional marriage and family life don't have much more to say than self-interest does on these topics. Most of us at the turn of the millennium live in the fluid middle ground between the solitary Homo economicus, protecting his assets, and the tribe that uses degrees of blood kinship to define who is one of us and who is not. Our circle of relationships is chosen from those with whom we feel an affinity, and for such relationships as these, free-market capitalism offers no answers to the questions about who provides, what constitutes a commitment or an obligation or a responsibility, even what constitutes a relationship. The free market has shown us how our lives will look but not in what spirit they are to be lived. </p> <p>If marriage or partnership is for anything now, then it is for this: learning by experience how to express love. Compassion, tenderness, patience, responsibility, kindness, and honesty are actions that elicit similar responses from others. These are not bargaining chips; when they are used that way they lose their essence as well as their ability to elicit anything from others but suspicion. Moreover, compassion, tenderness, patience, responsibility, kindness, and honesty increase the happiness of the compassionate, tender, patient, responsible, kind, and honest man or woman. </p> <p>The social redemption of marriage in our time is precisely in intimacy as a countervailing force against the chaotic isolation promoted by free-market capitalism. If we can share with our spouses and understand that we both benefit, then we can share with our children and understand the same thing, and after that we can share with other children, and with our friends, with our communities, and with the larger community that is all around us, now rendered less fearsome by our own choice to approach it with a sense of connection. We can build up a network that reminds us over and over that connection is the very stuff of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. </p> <p>\u0095 Jane Smiley's latest novel is Horse Heaven (Faber, \u00a317.99)</p>",

The last night before my daughter went back to college, we had another one of those family dinners, you know, me, my boyfriend, his daughter and son by his second wife, my daughters by my second husband, and my seven-year-old son by my third husband. The topic of conversation was how my son came to walk home from school, more than a mile up a steep, winding road, on a very warm day. 'What did you do when cars went by?' I asked. 'I stepped to the side of the road!' he answered. He was laughing at the success of his exploit. Not only had he been a very bold boy who had accomplished something he had been wanting to do; he had been impressively disobedient. We all laughed, and my boyfriend and I squeezed each other's hands, pleased and seduced by that happy-family idea, everyone safe and well-fed, getting along, taken care of. But we are not married, and have no plans to blend our families. I come to the theory and practice of marriage at the start of the new millennium with a decidedly chequered past and an outsider's view. But, I admit, I'm still paying attention, implicated, at least, by the fact that my children assume they will get married. I see the same thing as many others do, the breakdown of the traditional family, but I don't see this as a dark and fearsome eventuality, rather as something interesting to observe, something that I have endured, survived, and actually benefited from, something that will certainly be part of the material from which my children build their lives. II. Children Capitalism has an excellent reputation, among fans of the free market, for disseminating goods and information and moulding the lives of consumers in the ways that best serve both the system and individuals. If this is indeed the case, then late capitalism has evidently decided that what is best for us and our children is serial monogamy, frequent changes of employment, and a high degree of instability. It has decided that, on balance, it is better for all adults to work rather than for one designated gender to stay home with the children. It has decided that most children will spend at least part of their childhoods in the care of people outside their families. It has decided that the individual's relationship to society will be less and less mediated through the family and more and more experienced directly. Fans of the free market would say that we should embrace rather than resist what capitalism has decided. Which is not to say that when, 16 years ago, I parted from the father of my two daughters, I wasn't traumatised. The choice of staying or leaving presented itself to me as a choice between suicide and mass murder. For years afterward, I secretly scrutinised the girls for signs of psychological damage, and I read, with sinking heart, every article in the news about the negative impact of divorce upon children. It wasn't until my son came along, the child of my next marriage, that I appreciated this gloriously cruel fact of life: had I not divorced my daughters' father, I would never have borne my son, and how could I do without any of the three of them? My daughters are 21 and 17 now, and they have spent many years contemplating their own family and the families of their friends, comparing and choosing and wishing. They have a network of siblings: a stepsister and stepbrother nearly their own age from their father's second marriage, a foster brother, also from that marriage, and a half brother, my son. Their stepsiblings have stepsiblings of their own, to whom my daughters feel related. All eight of these kids elect to maintain family ties with one another, ties that bind them more closely to one another than to their various stepparents. My daughters like the looseness of this and compare it favourably with the tightness of their friends' traditional families, which seem a little suffocating. And I have experienced the input of the stepparents and the stepsiblings as productive and enlightening. What I thought of as mass murder turned out to be freedom: freedom from the particular family pathology that the girls' father and I were monogamously building in our four-bedroom house on that corner lot in that state I now think of as Monogamy Central. III. Men Let's say that there is only one thing we know about men: that they feel a tension between monogamy and promiscuity. Let's further say that the balance of that tension is different in different men, and that it changes as the men age, sometimes from monogamy toward promiscuity and sometimes from promiscuity toward monogamy. If we accept as fact only this one thing about men, then any one marriage would be more or less likely to be unstable, while at the same time marriage as an institution would be a valuable social check upon the chaos of promiscuity. Men themselves would have a stake in promoting stability for others while trying to find some wiggle room for themselves. One thing that seems to be evident from history is that marriage as a property relationship is more stable than marriage as a personal relationship. It is not until women emerge from property status that the tension between monogamy and promiscuity is really a problem. It is women with voices and a certain amount of power who force men to choose between possible types of relationships. We can easily imagine a man having a mother, a housekeeper, a wife who has produced his legitimate children, a concubine, a sister, and even a female friend, all living under the same roof. The trouble is, we can't imagine him in the West. In America and Europe, custom requires that the mother and sister live elsewhere and all of the others be rolled into one, the wife. Wives require it, too. When courtship was about joining properties, then it could be short. Now that marriage is about being everything to one another, courtship takes a long time and can break down at any point. It is difficult to find a mate who is equally good at every function, and it is also difficult to know oneself well enough to know which function you care about more than the others. And then, of course, as the marriage project moves through its stages - householding, child-rearing, professional success, ageing - the functions you once cared about change or evolve. The great lover who can't manage to get a dirty dish into the dishwasher becomes more annoying than exciting, the wonderful friend who is infertile is a figure of tragedy, the terrific mother who harps about responsibility comes to seem like a nag. And that tension between monogamy and promiscuity remains, now transformed into a dilemma of character. The trouble with serial monogamy, which I define as being faithfully married to one person until you can't stand it any more, and then being faithfully married to another person who fits the new standard better, is that each transition in the series comes as a personal defeat. Serial infidelity is even worse, a strange combination of victory and defeat every time the husband cheats on his wife, until he is numb not only to the moral attractions of monogamy but also to the erotic attractions of promiscuity. Capitalism doesn't decide between the two simultaneous male drives toward promiscuity and monogamy but promotes both frenetically, knowing, like stockbrokers, that there is more money to be made by churning a portfolio than by holding on to it. It is for the men themselves to decide how expensive a great deal of change is, and whether the expense, in the end, is worth it. As late capitalism becomes later capitalism, the pressure toward individual change can only increase, since change generates wealth and circulates it too. But change also promotes learning and flexibility, at least for some. Those who learn often not only find mates who suit them but also find out how to value those mates. They begin to master the idea of relating, sharing, forgiving, taking responsibility. They begin to understand the relative merits of monogamy and promiscuity, even to forge new modes of relating that transcend the apparent split between the two. Whether they can fit these new modes into marriage remains, however, to be seen. IV. Fidelity Infidelity in marriage is a form of inattention. The spouse becomes less interesting than someone new, and the unfaithful party either isn't around much or seems distracted when he or she is. Some years ago, for example, a friend of mine had a breast biopsy. Her husband took her to the clinic on Thursday, stayed with her, brought her home, and tended to her that afternoon and evening. The next morning, when she was to go back for a check-up, he coolly suggested that their 16-year-old daughter could handle it and that the wife would be fine for the rest of the day by herself. It later turned out that he had prior plans to spend the day with his 25-year-old girlfriend and didn't want to change them. In the course of their bitter divorce, this callousness seemed particularly monstrous, the wife sitting home alone in pain and fear while the husband was cavorting with a woman 25 years his junior. Yes, he was a lout, but what if he had been able to treat both women with love and compassion, patience and tenderness? What if when he was with the wife he had been fully with her, and when he was with the girlfriend he had been fully with her? Would each have been satisfied? Could he, could anyone, have done that? When I began seeing my current boyfriend, he had another girlfriend, who was seeing another guy. Since the very thing that broke up my last marriage was my former husband's infidelity, it seemed to me that I was putting myself right back into danger, and so for a long time we refrained from identifying our relationship even as a 'relationship.' We were friends, then 'all-inclusive friends'. A turning point came about six months in, when the other girlfriend broke up with her other boyfriend and said to Jack, 'Well, I guess it's just you and me again,' and he said to her, 'Well, you, me, and Jane.' Within a few weeks, she had another boyfriend. Sometimes we would have dinner together, all four of us, but our dinners were, to say the least, volatile. Even so, all of the relationships, mine with him, his with her, hers with the other guy, endured, and not without pain and jealousy on the part of every single one of us. But we had a principle. We were not married, and, further, we didn't wish to take marriage as our paradigm. Couples in the West begin taking marriage as their paradigm almost as soon as they begin dating: going steady, exchanging rings, or whatever. It takes real conviction and unusual stubbornness to flout the paradigm, and I, for one, needed help to do so. More than anything, I wanted another marriage to close over my head like the surface of a vast sea, preventing the acquisition of any real understanding of myself, my sexuality, and my ways of relating to men. The other girlfriend and her very central place in the life of the man I loved prevented that, and her own refusal to allow her sexual freedom to be restricted offered a model of an alternative. Some men and women have the knack of being so delightfully present that time with them is worthwhile in and of itself, whether or not any promises about exclusiveness have been made. There are people in whom freedom is the very essence of their appeal, and those who love them have to make the choice: Is the desire to possess, in and of itself, more worth pursuing than the relationship with that delightful person, and if so, why? Or is that relationship, whatever it entails, the valuable thing? To be forced to ponder these questions is to be forced to ask yourself about your own freedom and autonomy, your own ability to be present with your friend or spouse when he is present with you as well as your ability to be present with yourself when he is not with you. One thing I have discovered is that I always mistook longing for love. If I felt enough longing, then that was the sure sign that this was love. The trouble was that I could feel longing for my friend when he was right there, in my arms, talking to me. If I got rid of the longing, then I didn't recognise what was left as love, and in fact it took me a long time to recognise love when I felt it. Not getting married was the education in learning not to be oblivious, but instead honest and observant. Fidelity, more than anything else, is the signifier of marriage. To forswear fidelity is to open yourself up to other ideas, other thoughts, about what love is, what desire is, what happiness is, and what commitment is. V. Feminism It was inevitable that women would rise out of property status. Capitalism wants every consumer, and ultimately distinctions among consumers according to gender, age, geographical location or ethnic background must break down as the market extends itself. Since marriage began as a property relationship, its foundations are challenged by the transformation of the property into personhood. True marriage, or remarriage, begins with the revelation that union between male and female is a divine reconciliation between equals. The rise of women, in my opinion, is a done deal. Even a huge cataclysm seems incapable of returning women to property status. Let's say that one thing is true about women: they know who their children are. The tension they feel is the tension between the claims of the self and the claims of the child, and once again the balance varies among individuals and over the course of a lifetime. The high fertility level of women suggests that nature favours culling rather than preselection as the mode of limiting the human population. In this, nature is like the free market, which is never merciful nor safe in the short term or to the individual. Free-market capitalism is very much like a large, vital ecosystem that balances itself over time by getting rid of this or that individual or group. As we proliferate, our value as units declines, and we have to enhance our value relative to others by offering a scarce talent, or else combining with others to share both the work and the wealth. The obvious course is to combine with men, the fathers of our children, as a way of avoiding the heartbreak of natural culling, but the success of feminism as an outgrowth of the free market requires the reconstitution of marriage so that both men and women benefit from it. At the turn of the millennium, that is where we find ourselves. VI. Sex Marriage as a property relationship organised sex very clearly. The transfer of property from one family to another, and then from one generation to another, gave primacy to the reproductive function of sex. Reproductive choice is one of the products of free-market capitalism that actually has been as revolutionary as advertised, and undoubtedly could have destroyed marriage as a property relationship all by itself, because the effect of reproductive choice is to promote desire as an end, and endless desire as the ultimate goal. More optimistic philosophers of capitalism view desire as a form of greed, perhaps the highest form of greed, and therefore the most profitable. Pessimistic philosophers of capitalism have other ideas: a form of infantilism (Freud), a biological urge, a sin, a weakness, a failure of will. People who get married tend to view it as a promise. The way someone defines desire determines its result. Defining it as hunger for something wanting, for example, dictates that it must be sated, especially in marriage; the best you can hope for is that tricks and brief deprivations will put off satiation temporarily. Some Hollywood movies, such as Casablanca, define it as a brief consummation preceded and followed by years of deprivation: the briefer the consummation, the more total the deprivation, the more perfect the experience of desire. Humphrey Bogart's last line to Claude Rains is spoken with relief: romantic deprivation is exactly what he has wanted all along. The alternative scenario, as in, for example, The Big Sleep, is that the couple will experience danger and potential deprivation, and their level of desire will thereby be enhanced beyond the power of permanent commitment to drain it off completely. The logical end of this line of thinking is Bonnie and Clyde or Natural Born Killers, the rapid alternation of sex and the threat of death climaxing in a shoot-out or the electric chair. In fact, for market capitalism, sex is like everything else - something to want when you don't have it and to not want when you do have it. This poses a problem for marriage based on personal relationship, especially since the fluctuating desires of two people need to be taken into account. The solution to the difficulties of marital sex offered by free-market capitalism is a lifetime of courtship, which, like all courtship, carries a high degree of cruelty. Not long ago I was at the beauty parlour, eavesdropping on a 70-year-old woman who, when the hairdresser asked if she had a boyfriend, said, 'Don't you know? At my age they say, \"If he's younger than you, he's after your purse, if he's older than you, he's after a nurse.\"' We all laughed, because we ruefully agreed. And yet courtship after 50 is illuminating in several ways. One of these grows out of the fact that the path from erection to ejaculation is neither as short nor as direct as it once was, thereby inviting both partners, but especially the man, to explore other, some cultures would say higher, modes of pleasure. Another grows out of the uncoupling of roles - neither partner is in the throes of choosing a career, defining an identity, or deciding whether and how to have children; the hopes and fears that impinge upon sexuality in one's twenties and thirties have become regrets or achievements, but at any rate are decided. Sexuality itself is less mysterious, more available for experimentation. Does endless desire result from relaxation? Comedian Chris Rock has said, 'A man is only as faithful as his options', and to that, greed, serial monogamy, and promiscuity would say, 'Amen!' Lifetime courtship is an option, though, not a requirement. Marital sex after 50 presents the same opportunities as extramarital sex, if the partners can deflect the definitions of desire that the market offers. VII. Intimacy We marry to make ourselves happy. In this we have the approval of both free-market capitalism and the signers of the Declaration of Independence, who chose 'the pursuit of happiness' rather than 'property' as the appropriate corollary to life and liberty. Nevertheless, when we marry we mostly don't know what will make us happy. Happiness is a multiple-choice test: steady companionship? lots of stuff? a nice place to live? children? plenty of sex? good health? freedom to do what we want? The free market offers one suggestion after another, and serial monogamy as well as serial infidelity can be seen as a method of sampling all the wares, all the theories about happiness. Capitalism has ordained diversity. I was Protestant-agnostic from St Louis. My first husband was Irish-Catholic from Wyoming. My second husband was Hungarian-Catholic from the Bronx. My third husband was Nordic-Baptist from Iowa. In every case, the things we knew unconsciously about how a family is constituted and what various verbal and physical signals meant sometimes agreed and sometimes disagreed. We often found ourselves misinterpreting, miscommunicating, feeling alone. Add to this the inherent communication differences between men and women, and intimacy seems an unlikely outcome. Our parents' wish that we marry within our faith and within our neighbourhood, seems, in retrospect, a practical alternative. The solution that capitalism offers is bargaining, and, indeed, we are often advised to become good negotiators in our relationships; that is, to communicate specifically and explicitly, to be fair in divvying up responsibilities, and to understand that relationships are like contracts. But bargaining in the home shares the limitations of bargaining in the marketplace. Advantage can be gained by being dishonest or secretive or by withholding a desired object. Bargaining also rewards the partners for soliciting third parties in deciding whether the agreement has been violated. A bargain can never truly be fair, and so it focuses the minds of the bargainers on inequities and betrayals. The first requirement of intimacy is honesty. Honesty between spouses is supremely difficult unless each spouse feels complete, because bargaining is about negotiating needs; that is, compensations for incompleteness. If the only reason to marry is to be happy, and happiness can result only from intimacy, then serial monogamy is the natural result of a strategy of bargaining as a way of divvying up marital responsibilities. Codependency is an interesting late-capitalist pathology that illuminates both intimacy and bargaining. The codependent is said to be someone who gives up an explicit bargain in favour of an implicit bargain. Instead of you taking care of me and me taking care of the children, say, or you bringing home the money and me taking care of the house, our bargain is, allegedly, that you act like my drunken father and I feel a sense of familiarity. Except that the codependent partners often don't consciously feel that such is the bargain they have made. Rather, they feel that they have committed themselves to each other, but problems of addiction, finances, illness, and temperament have made the commitment a troubled one. The instinct of the couple is to try harder to sustain the commitment, but their psychological advisers view this as the very sign that pathology is at work. If bargaining is the model, then they are right - good bargaining always strives for explicitness and fairness. If intimacy is the model, then something else is going on. Psychological professionals always say that codependents are avoiding intimacy, but, in fact, the partners actually have achieved a high level of intimacy, because they have confronted the inconveniences of each other and have chosen to accept them, rather than avoid them. The problem is not intimacy, per se, but each partner's sense of self. If the depredations of each partner had no negative effect, then the relationship would not be pathological but potentially transformative, rather like what happens when one spouse contracts a serious illness that puts both spouses to the test and brings them to new and deeper levels of intimacy. The most important requirement of recovery from addiction is absolute honesty, the most important requirement of intimacy, but, in the pantheon of self-serving virtues required by free-market capitalism, it is nowhere to be found. VIII. Money Divorce laws in the state of California, where I live, are absolute. Whatever property accrues to the partners in a marriage accrues to both and shall be divided equally by both, no matter who accrued it, who left, who broke the contract. The moral construction of the marriage bond has no legal weight, and very little bargaining is allowed. Perhaps these laws were intended to retard marital breakdown. In a model where the husband accrues the money, then discards the wife and children for a younger woman, possibly he might be given pause by the idea that it's cheaper to keep her. If the model is different, and, for example, the money was accrued by the wife, who bore the children and kept to the contract but the husband left her anyway for a younger woman, giving in to his inherent drive toward promiscuity, then the outcome is the same - halving of the property. In such a case, the departing male has no reason to maintain the marriage and every reason to leave it. He who came in with nothing leaves with quite a bit - an excellent deal. In the divorce culture, laws like those in the state of California serve as a disincentive to marriage, especially between people of disparate incomes. Serial monogamy turns out to be a way periodically to halve your assets. The free market, especially in the last 30 years, has decreed that disparate incomes shall be the norm. Those who have also have lawyers advising them on how to protect what they have against the intimate enemy, the potential future spouse, using the family trust, the prenuptial agreement. When I told my lawyer that my boyfriend was going to remodel my house, she advised me to get a strict estimate and regular billings, then to keep a record of the cheques I paid him with so that if we broke up he couldn't claim equity in the house and force me to sell it. In California, apparently, any type of affectional relationship is dangerous. Of course, the logical end to all of this is: every man a nomad, and every woman, too. And yet, as the baby-boom generation ages, the problem that faces Social Security faces individuals and families too. Who provides? When marriage was a property relationship and assets were concentrated in the hands of patriarchs, the answer was clear. Now, with assets circulating at an accelerated pace through an economy more and more in flux, customs regulating who pays and who is paid for have little time to take hold, while the selfishness and greed that are the default options of the system gain currency. Who pays for the children? Who pays for the men and women without pension plans? Who pays for the unlucky and the unwise? Greed and selfishness always say, not me! IX. Why are you married? I know quite a few people who support children not their own. I know some people who support children not even belonging to their spouses or mates. Why they would do so goes unanswered by both economics and sociobiology, and is explained only by invoking love or the common good. And free-market capitalism is a poor teacher when it comes to understanding love or the common good. Traditional marriage and family life don't have much more to say than self-interest does on these topics. Most of us at the turn of the millennium live in the fluid middle ground between the solitary Homo economicus, protecting his assets, and the tribe that uses degrees of blood kinship to define who is one of us and who is not. Our circle of relationships is chosen from those with whom we feel an affinity, and for such relationships as these, free-market capitalism offers no answers to the questions about who provides, what constitutes a commitment or an obligation or a responsibility, even what constitutes a relationship. The free market has shown us how our lives will look but not in what spirit they are to be lived. If marriage or partnership is for anything now, then it is for this: learning by experience how to express love. Compassion, tenderness, patience, responsibility, kindness, and honesty are actions that elicit similar responses from others. These are not bargaining chips; when they are used that way they lose their essence as well as their ability to elicit anything from others but suspicion. Moreover, compassion, tenderness, patience, responsibility, kindness, and honesty increase the happiness of the compassionate, tender, patient, responsible, kind, and honest man or woman. The social redemption of marriage in our time is precisely in intimacy as a countervailing force against the chaotic isolation promoted by free-market capitalism. If we can share with our spouses and understand that we both benefit, then we can share with our children and understand the same thing, and after that we can share with other children, and with our friends, with our communities, and with the larger community that is all around us, now rendered less fearsome by our own choice to approach it with a sense of connection. We can build up a network that reminds us over and over that connection is the very stuff of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. \u0095 Jane Smiley's latest novel is Horse Heaven (Faber, \u00a317.99)",

      "body": "<p>In the English literary tradition, the genre of biography, which first became popular in the eighteenth century with Johnson's Lives of the English Poets and Boswell's Life of Johnson, gets a mixed press. 'A well-written Life is almost as rare as a well-spent one,' noted Carlyle. 'Every great man nowadays has his disciples,' observed Oscar Wilde, 'and it is always Judas who writes the biography.'</p> <p>It was the Victorians whose marmoreal three-volume lives gave even contemporaries the pip. Reviewing J.W. Cross's Life of George Eliot, that eminent Victorian W.E. Gladstone commented, out of the side of his mouth: 'It is not a Life at all. It is a Reticence, in three volumes.' </p> <p>Then along came Lytton Strachey with his wilfully iconoclastic assertion that: 'Discretion is not the better part of biography.' I do not know if Strachey was truly the first to tear up the Victorians' unwritten contract between the biographer and his subject, but he was certainly the most gifted, the most eloquent and the most scathing. Who can forget his portrait of Disraeli, the 'assiduous mummy', or his Florence Nightingale, unable 'hardly to distinguish between the Deity and the Drains'? </p> <p>After Strachey, biography became a shouting match between the public and the private self. By mid-century, there was, in the catalogue, only one creature worse than the biographer, and that was the literary biographer, who was to be ranked somewhere between a cold-hearted voyeur and a merciless grave-robber. James Joyce coined the term 'biografiend'; and T.S. Eliot instructed in his will that there should be no official biography. From the other end of the literary spectrum, J.R.R. Tolkein wrote that the 'investigation of an author's biography is an entirely vain and false approach to his works'. </p> <p>In our own time, the hostility to the literary biographer has inspired some memorable comments. From Martin Amis: 'To be more interested in the writer than the writing is just eternal human vulgarity.' From Milan Kundera: 'Biographers know nothing about the intimate sex lives of their own wives, but they think they know all about Stendhal's or Faulkner's.' And from Edmund White (himself the distinguished biographer of Andr\u00e9 Gide): 'Biography is a form by which little people take revenge on big people.' The suspicion that one should fear the biographer like the Grim Reaper is not assuaged by the obiter dicta of celebrated contemporary practitioners like Peter Ackroyd: 'Fiction requires truth-telling, whereas in a biography one can make things up.' </p> <p>The contemporary biographer, then, is generally not a popular figure, and his or her creativity is widely mistrusted. There are, however, exceptions to this rule. Chief among these is the biographer Richard Holmes, a writer whose work is treated by his fans with something near veneration. </p> <p>Holmes burst on to the scene in the early Seventies with his acclaimed biography Shelley: The Pursuit. In the grubby world of literary lives this was something new. Passionate, meticulously researched down to the last candle-end and exquisitely written, Holmes's Shelley announced the arrival of a daring biographical artist, a writer whose 'method' placed him closer to the free fancy of the novelist than the harmless drudging of the biografiend.</p> <p>As A.S. Byatt demonstrates in her latest novel The Biographer's Tale (Chatto &amp; Windus) there are any number of big issues that such writers must address. These include: the ambiguity of the apparent connections between art and life; the doubtful reliability of letters and diaries; the distortions implicit in constructing a continuous and satisfying narrative out of a haphazard life; the place of empathy on the biographer's palette, and the likelihood of psychological 'transference' between biographer and subject. In Shelley, Holmes triumphantly surmounted all these obstacles with a ruminative, almost hallucinatory, ramble through the landscape of his subject's life, an inspired marriage of fact and intuition that was highly original and brilliantly effective. </p> <p>After Shelley, Holmes disappeared from view. No new biography was forthcoming, and when he did surface it was with a fascinating and influential book of reflections about his art (Footsteps) which revived again the hope that its author would soon complete something more substantial. </p> <p>As it turned out, Holmes was to answer this expectation twice over in the next 15 years with his astounding two-volume biography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge (Early Visions and Darker Reflections). </p> <p>And now, for those who want to trace his footsteps through his chosen literary labyrinth, and for others who might be intrigued to learn more about his technique, he has published Sidetracks (HarperCollins \u00a319.99 pp420) a 'personal casebook' subtitled Explorations of a Romantic Biographer. The 'romantic' is crucial: Holmes fills us in on his attraction to 'lonely, extreme, isolated figures - often on the edge of suicide or madness' (Chatterton, M.R. James, and Mary Wollstonecraft among others), makes some tactful allusions to his 'beloved' Rose Tremain, and finally enlarges on his preference for 'snuffling' down 'sidetracks' in pursuit of his subjects. </p> <p>Like Hamlet, his preferred method is 'by indirections find directions out'. This is a delightfully eccentric volume that Boswell would have adored, and Johnson well understood. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk\">robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

I do not know if Strachey was truly the first to tear up the Victorians' unwritten contract between the biographer and his subject, but he was certainly the most gifted, the most eloquent and the most scathing. Who can forget his portrait of Disraeli, the 'assiduous mummy', or his Florence Nightingale, unable 'hardly to distinguish between the Deity and the Drains'? After Strachey, biography became a shouting match between the public and the private self. By mid-century, there was, in the catalogue, only one creature worse than the biographer, and that was the literary biographer, who was to be ranked somewhere between a cold-hearted voyeur and a merciless grave-robber. James Joyce coined the term 'biografiend'; and T.S. Eliot instructed in his will that there should be no official biography. From the other end of the literary spectrum, J.R.R. Tolkein wrote that the 'investigation of an author's biography is an entirely vain and false approach to his works'. In our own time, the hostility to the literary biographer has inspired some memorable comments. From Martin Amis: 'To be more interested in the writer than the writing is just eternal human vulgarity.' From Milan Kundera: 'Biographers know nothing about the intimate sex lives of their own wives, but they think they know all about Stendhal's or Faulkner's.' And from Edmund White (himself the distinguished biographer of Andr\u00e9 Gide): 'Biography is a form by which little people take revenge on big people.' The suspicion that one should fear the biographer like the Grim Reaper is not assuaged by the obiter dicta of celebrated contemporary practitioners like Peter Ackroyd: 'Fiction requires truth-telling, whereas in a biography one can make things up.' The contemporary biographer, then, is generally not a popular figure, and his or her creativity is widely mistrusted. There are, however, exceptions to this rule. Chief among these is the biographer Richard Holmes, a writer whose work is treated by his fans with something near veneration. Holmes burst on to the scene in the early Seventies with his acclaimed biography Shelley: The Pursuit. In the grubby world of literary lives this was something new. Passionate, meticulously researched down to the last candle-end and exquisitely written, Holmes's Shelley announced the arrival of a daring biographical artist, a writer whose 'method' placed him closer to the free fancy of the novelist than the harmless drudging of the biografiend. As A.S. Byatt demonstrates in her latest novel The Biographer's Tale (Chatto &amp; Windus) there are any number of big issues that such writers must address. These include: the ambiguity of the apparent connections between art and life; the doubtful reliability of letters and diaries; the distortions implicit in constructing a continuous and satisfying narrative out of a haphazard life; the place of empathy on the biographer's palette, and the likelihood of psychological 'transference' between biographer and subject. In Shelley, Holmes triumphantly surmounted all these obstacles with a ruminative, almost hallucinatory, ramble through the landscape of his subject's life, an inspired marriage of fact and intuition that was highly original and brilliantly effective. After Shelley, Holmes disappeared from view. No new biography was forthcoming, and when he did surface it was with a fascinating and influential book of reflections about his art (Footsteps) which revived again the hope that its author would soon complete something more substantial. As it turned out, Holmes was to answer this expectation twice over in the next 15 years with his astounding two-volume biography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge (Early Visions and Darker Reflections). And now, for those who want to trace his footsteps through his chosen literary labyrinth, and for others who might be intrigued to learn more about his technique, he has published Sidetracks (HarperCollins \u00a319.99 pp420) a 'personal casebook' subtitled Explorations of a Romantic Biographer. The 'romantic' is crucial: Holmes fills us in on his attraction to 'lonely, extreme, isolated figures - often on the edge of suicide or madness' (Chatterton, M.R. James, and Mary Wollstonecraft among others), makes some tactful allusions to his 'beloved' Rose Tremain, and finally enlarges on his preference for 'snuffling' down 'sidetracks' in pursuit of his subjects. Like Hamlet, his preferred method is 'by indirections find directions out'. This is a delightfully eccentric volume that Boswell would have adored, and Johnson well understood. robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk",

The first-person narratives, which force the reader closer to the terror the women are feeling, are brilliantly handled. Each women has a distinctive voice. Zoe is a 23-year-old teacher, self-sufficient with a small circle of friends trying to sell her horrible flat on the Holloway Road. Jenny, older, is unhappily married, middle-class, rich and lonely. At first she seems almost a caricature but as her narrative progresses she becomes the most complex of the women. Nadia, a children's entertainer, is a character for whom that overused word 'feisty' should be minted afresh. It's a curious irony that while over the past decade detective fiction, with its increasing number of strong female protagonists, has empowered women, at the same time serial killer novels have made them victims, usually of truly terrible, graphically described violence. So what's refreshing about Beneath The Skin is that while these are women in peril, at least one of them is going to take her destiny back into her own hands.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Yes </strong><br></p> <p>Type a few words into a web search-engine and you can find information on any subject in seconds. What happens next depends what one is thinking about and one's reaction to that information. RIP's proponents say the internet is like a public space, and just as the police don't need a judge's warrant merely to keep any eye on someone in the street, they must be allowed to track any person's movements as they click from website to website. </p> <p>As drafted, RIP gives the police and other government bodies authority to access a person's 'clickstream' - the virtual record of his or her train of thought; no formal investigation need be underway, no warrant is required. Last Monday the Government asked the House of Lords to believe that this was some kind of drafting mistake, but when pressed would not deny that their intention all along was for Big Browser to be Watching You. </p> <p>RIP can require internet service providers to install 'black boxes' which see every scrap of data traversing their networks, all under the control of a monitoring centre in the MI5 building. There is obviously a problem of oversight here, but the director of the National Criminal Intelligence Service (who will operate it) last week knocked down the straw man that they 'would or could monitor all emails'. The issue is that nobody will know for sure what the boxes are doing, and RIP is drafted so that their operation is lawful without even serving warrants on the ISP. </p> <p>The real trouble with RIP is that it won't work - and the reason is encryption. On an open system like the internet, the only way to keep data safe is to scramble it, so if a fraudster or industrial spy hacks into your system, the data is unintelligible without the right password or 'key'. Encryption will be ubiquitous - it's already built into the fabric of the next technical standard for the internet, and serious e-commerce applications will never be trusted without it. </p> <p>RIP proposes to deal with the problem of criminal use of encryption by giving any public authority power to demand any key or password to any data there is some lawful authority to obtain - whether intercepted under warrant, seized in a search, or held by an innocent party. People forget passwords and lose keys all the time, but if you find yourself in this situation you could go to jail for two years. Serious criminals will obviously plead a bad memory, so NCIS wants the sentence to be as long as whatever crime someone is suspected of. </p> <p>There is also a secrecy condition that can prohibit someone from disclosing that a key has been divulged - on pain of a further five years.

      "bodyText": "Yes Type a few words into a web search-engine and you can find information on any subject in seconds. What happens next depends what one is thinking about and one's reaction to that information. RIP's proponents say the internet is like a public space, and just as the police don't need a judge's warrant merely to keep any eye on someone in the street, they must be allowed to track any person's movements as they click from website to website. As drafted, RIP gives the police and other government bodies authority to access a person's 'clickstream' - the virtual record of his or her train of thought; no formal investigation need be underway, no warrant is required. Last Monday the Government asked the House of Lords to believe that this was some kind of drafting mistake, but when pressed would not deny that their intention all along was for Big Browser to be Watching You. RIP can require internet service providers to install 'black boxes' which see every scrap of data traversing their networks, all under the control of a monitoring centre in the MI5 building. There is obviously a problem of oversight here, but the director of the National Criminal Intelligence Service (who will operate it) last week knocked down the straw man that they 'would or could monitor all emails'. The issue is that nobody will know for sure what the boxes are doing, and RIP is drafted so that their operation is lawful without even serving warrants on the ISP. The real trouble with RIP is that it won't work - and the reason is encryption. On an open system like the internet, the only way to keep data safe is to scramble it, so if a fraudster or industrial spy hacks into your system, the data is unintelligible without the right password or 'key'. Encryption will be ubiquitous - it's already built into the fabric of the next technical standard for the internet, and serious e-commerce applications will never be trusted without it. RIP proposes to deal with the problem of criminal use of encryption by giving any public authority power to demand any key or password to any data there is some lawful authority to obtain - whether intercepted under warrant, seized in a search, or held by an innocent party. People forget passwords and lose keys all the time, but if you find yourself in this situation you could go to jail for two years. Serious criminals will obviously plead a bad memory, so NCIS wants the sentence to be as long as whatever crime someone is suspected of. There is also a secrecy condition that can prohibit someone from disclosing that a key has been divulged - on pain of a further five years. But RIP can be evaded by taking elementary countermeasures, and will plainly be impotent against serious criminals. There is an alternative, but the Government refuses to discuss it. Interception is useless if the data is encrypted, but even the strongest code is useless if the key is stolen. All computers have bugs in the software that allow hackers to break in, and developing a battery of such techniques would allow keys to be stolen covertly (under warrant) when required. The police say this is too difficult and unfortunately for us all, it probably is too difficult for the current management.

While lesser women slump exhausted on the sofa, the Employment Minister is still busy picking things up, sorting things out, restoring order to her Camden home. Tessa Jowell is pretty keen on order. There is something about the rather saintly Jowell, who cheerfully admits her life is 'blessed', that is almost too irritatingly good to be true. And she has certainly set hackles rising this week, branded the nation's nanny after her efforts to tackle teenage anorexia backfired.</p> <p>She ought to be easy to dislike. But Jowell is so unfailingly nice, and so fired with an unexpected passion on behalf of the underdog, that it is really rather difficult not to be charmed. And she is stoical under fire. 'I'm blessed with a large, very close-knit family and I'm blessed with a huge number of friends I absolutely adore,' she says. 'I'm not one of those bonkers politicians who think about nothing but politics. My job enables me to achieve dreams I've held dear since my early twenties, but I have a rich and big life outside politics that helps me keep it all in perspective.'</p> <p>However, she is still angry that her summit, on whether images of skinny superwaifs fuel anorexia, descended into derision. The press seized on proposals to monitor images of fat and thin women on television. Wasn't she the do-gooder who suggested giving women extra benefits if they breast-fed their babies, and wanted to ban smoking in public places? But Jowell rejects the 'nanny' tag, blaming the media for trivialising her intentions.</p> <p>'It is ludicrous to suggest that I wanted to set up some sort of ridiculous fat-woman, thin-woman tally last week,' she says. 'It's just another example of the papers going for the cheap shot at the expense of the truth, which was far more sensible, constructive and mundane.</p> <p>'I loathe nanny politics,' she adds. 'I have never wanted to nanny anyone in my life. That is not what government is for. If some people want to die early, that is their choice: I just want to make sure their decisions are educated ones.'</p> <p>She's right, but this week Jowell fell foul of the one thing she has always guarded against: letting the political message run out of control. All her life she has tried to do the right thing, and if friends ever criticise, it is to say she should relax a bit.</p> <p>She was born in 1947, daughter of a doctor and a radiographer, into a family where public service was taken for granted. As a little girl she wanted to be a doctor, but her father said it was men's work. Instead, she did her Master's in social administration at Edinburgh University and started out as a child care officer in Lambeth.</p> <p>She trained in the unglamorous area of psychiatric social work, spent 12 years with the mental health charity MIND, and still says her most rewarding time was in Birmingham on a social care project: she stayed overnight in old people's homes to see conditions for herself.</p> <p>As a Camden councillor in the Eighties she was on-message before the message existed, so outraged by the loony-left that she considered defecting to the SDP. Her marriage to social scientist Roger Jowell ended after five years. She met City lawyer David Mills through the council and they married in 1979, after her first unsuccessful attempt at standing for Parliament. She tried again, in Dulwich in 1992, and won.</p> <p>Telegenic and tireless, Jowell became one of the most familiar faces of the 1997 election campaign, although so anxious not to stray from Labour's Yellow Brick Road that even Millbank raised eyebrows at the number of phonecalls she made before every interview she gave. She landed the job of Public Health Minister after the election, moving to employment at the last reshuffle.</p> <p>Her only real rocky patch came early. She was the Minister negotiating motor racing's exemption from a ban on tobacco advertising when it emerged that Formula 1 chief Bernie Ecclestone had made a \u00a31 million gift to Labour. Then it transpired her husband was non-executive director of Benetton, which races F1 cars. Jowell had played by the rules, but ended up carrying the can.</p> <p>She has always been prodigiously disciplined: when her children were young she would work through the night to buy time later in the day for a school play, and still regularly does her red boxes at dawn. Jowell is clearly driven, but her huge network of friends say you would never know it. 'We're always amazed at how she manages to be so nice,' said one. 'We drive away after an evening with her and her husband discussing quite openly where on earth her dark side could be. One presumes there must be one.'</p> <p>Stories of her kindness abound. One journalist recalls how, when he suffered a brutal redundancy, Jowell asked him to dinner.

      "bodyText": "When Tessa Jowell needs to relax after a long day, what she likes best is, apparently, to tidy up. While lesser women slump exhausted on the sofa, the Employment Minister is still busy picking things up, sorting things out, restoring order to her Camden home. Tessa Jowell is pretty keen on order. There is something about the rather saintly Jowell, who cheerfully admits her life is 'blessed', that is almost too irritatingly good to be true. And she has certainly set hackles rising this week, branded the nation's nanny after her efforts to tackle teenage anorexia backfired. She ought to be easy to dislike. But Jowell is so unfailingly nice, and so fired with an unexpected passion on behalf of the underdog, that it is really rather difficult not to be charmed. And she is stoical under fire. 'I'm blessed with a large, very close-knit family and I'm blessed with a huge number of friends I absolutely adore,' she says. 'I'm not one of those bonkers politicians who think about nothing but politics. My job enables me to achieve dreams I've held dear since my early twenties, but I have a rich and big life outside politics that helps me keep it all in perspective.' However, she is still angry that her summit, on whether images of skinny superwaifs fuel anorexia, descended into derision. The press seized on proposals to monitor images of fat and thin women on television. Wasn't she the do-gooder who suggested giving women extra benefits if they breast-fed their babies, and wanted to ban smoking in public places? But Jowell rejects the 'nanny' tag, blaming the media for trivialising her intentions. 'It is ludicrous to suggest that I wanted to set up some sort of ridiculous fat-woman, thin-woman tally last week,' she says. 'It's just another example of the papers going for the cheap shot at the expense of the truth, which was far more sensible, constructive and mundane. 'I loathe nanny politics,' she adds. 'I have never wanted to nanny anyone in my life. That is not what government is for. If some people want to die early, that is their choice: I just want to make sure their decisions are educated ones.' She's right, but this week Jowell fell foul of the one thing she has always guarded against: letting the political message run out of control. All her life she has tried to do the right thing, and if friends ever criticise, it is to say she should relax a bit. She was born in 1947, daughter of a doctor and a radiographer, into a family where public service was taken for granted. As a little girl she wanted to be a doctor, but her father said it was men's work. Instead, she did her Master's in social administration at Edinburgh University and started out as a child care officer in Lambeth. She trained in the unglamorous area of psychiatric social work, spent 12 years with the mental health charity MIND, and still says her most rewarding time was in Birmingham on a social care project: she stayed overnight in old people's homes to see conditions for herself. As a Camden councillor in the Eighties she was on-message before the message existed, so outraged by the loony-left that she considered defecting to the SDP. Her marriage to social scientist Roger Jowell ended after five years. She met City lawyer David Mills through the council and they married in 1979, after her first unsuccessful attempt at standing for Parliament. She tried again, in Dulwich in 1992, and won. Telegenic and tireless, Jowell became one of the most familiar faces of the 1997 election campaign, although so anxious not to stray from Labour's Yellow Brick Road that even Millbank raised eyebrows at the number of phonecalls she made before every interview she gave. She landed the job of Public Health Minister after the election, moving to employment at the last reshuffle. Her only real rocky patch came early. She was the Minister negotiating motor racing's exemption from a ban on tobacco advertising when it emerged that Formula 1 chief Bernie Ecclestone had made a \u00a31 million gift to Labour. Then it transpired her husband was non-executive director of Benetton, which races F1 cars. Jowell had played by the rules, but ended up carrying the can. She has always been prodigiously disciplined: when her children were young she would work through the night to buy time later in the day for a school play, and still regularly does her red boxes at dawn. Jowell is clearly driven, but her huge network of friends say you would never know it. 'We're always amazed at how she manages to be so nice,' said one. 'We drive away after an evening with her and her husband discussing quite openly where on earth her dark side could be. One presumes there must be one.' Stories of her kindness abound. One journalist recalls how, when he suffered a brutal redundancy, Jowell asked him to dinner. 'She waited until the next time a three-line whip had been called at the Commons and then took me to a dining room there that is usually strictly out of bounds to journalists,' he says. 'She had booked a table in the centre of the room just so that she could be sure everyone there saw us together. She wanted to make it clear to them all that I was still in circulation. It was quite above and beyond the call of friendship.' In Government she has retained her knack for a soundbite, but also her principles: her proudest achievement is SureStart, the programme she and David Blunkett set up to advise deprived families on parenting and keeping children off the at-risk register. When she became Deputy Minister for Women in 1998, alongside Baroness Jay, she manoeuvred the much-ghettoised Women's Unit into the limelight without seeming too strident. Successes have been notable: pushing for the right for new mothers to return to work part-time, bigger maternity grants for the poorest mothers. But the Women's Unit lacks a significant budget, leaving it often dependent on cheap 'awareness-raising' initiatives rather than concrete action. Enter, fatefully, the anorexia summit. To some degree it is not Jowell's fault: any Minister fighting for large-scale social change under a government nervous of over-regulating is reduced to cajoling for a change of behaviour. And unfair though it unquestionably is, when women cajole and exhort, most people - and almost all men - are reminded of their mothers. And while Jowell is usually sincere, even close friends admit her manner can sometimes sets hackles rising. 'If people could just hear her when she's just being herself, saying what she really thinks with the passion she really feels, they would view her differently,' said a friend and colleague, 'but the moment she sits down in front of a microphone, she transforms into the worst kind of prissy, irritating nagger.' Jowell is always tipped for the Cabinet, but has always missed so far: not quite ready, the report card comes back, but definitely next time. Whitehall whispers that she needs more steel to stand up to Downing Street. And she may be missing out with the public for the same reason that John Prescott, Clare Short or Mo Mowlam luck in: that while she is resolutely on-message, they are often off. She may be word-perfect but her replies are reckoned to be concocted earlier in the New Labour lab. The gaff-prone, gawky response is the one reckoned to be imbued with honesty.

But unless she does, she could find herself shunted off into some form of political housekeeping. And that fate, for the Minister for Women, would be an irony too far.

'It is the worst pre-election violence and intimidation I have seen anywhere in the world,' Schori said.</p> <p>In the run up to the elections, which close tonight, at least 35 people have died in a wave of attacks on MDC supporters. Hundreds more have been injured. Women have been sexually assaulted and raped. At least 10,000 people have been forced to leave there homes, some fleeing into neighbouring countries such as Zambia, South Africa and Mozambique.</p> <p>In what some observers regard as the actions of a desperate man, Mugabe used the old African tricks of demonstrating pomp and grandeur. Flying round the country in his official helicopter, he attempted to rouse emotions with rhetoric he employed during the victorious four-year guerilla war against white minority rule.</p> <p>After a four-hour delay at his penultimate rally in Katuma, some 30 miles south of his birthplace, a fleet of Mercedes, flanked by motorcycle outriders, swept into the football station where it was being staged. Wearing a Zanu baseball cap, the 76-year-old did a lap of honour as an official chanted on a megaphone: 'Mugabe! Mugabe!' Bemused schoolchildren bussed in for the event clutched official Zanu flags.</p> <p>Mugabe waited at a nearby airstrip, refusing to appear until the numbers were greater. Police and officials rounded up people from neighbouring farms and businesses, bribing them with food and money to see the president.</p> <p>'Most people do not even remember the war,' a journalist said, as the sun beat down on the crowd. 'They just want jobs and food for their families. The economy is the most important thing - money, that is the source of everything. It is time for a big change. Too many old men are in charge of our country.'</p> <p>As Mugabe ordered the British to 'keep their big mouths shut', a dozen white farmers sat in chairs near the front of the crowd, having received an 'invitation' to the rally from a senior Zanu official. They were given flags covered in Zanu slogans as they entered the stadium, and twirled them awkwardly while Mugabe spoke. Asked why he felt obliged to come one farmer said: 'I think you know the answer to that one.'</p> <p>The white farmers quietly hope the MDC wins. Their farms were invaded on Mugabe's instructions after he failed to win a referendum in February giving him even greater powers. Although there are only 4,500 farmers out of a population of 11 million blacks and 70,000 whites, Mugabe focussed his wrath on them to win support from the majority blacks. As voting began yesterday, it became evident that Mugabe had misjudged the mood.</p> <p>The people of Zimbabwe's impoverished townships and rural areas were turning against their first president, sworn in the presence of Prince Charles in 1980. Outside one polling station in Harare yesterday, Trymore Rusike, a 30-year-old security guard, who had taken the day off to vote, was scathing about the president. 'Mugabe and his men are cheats and thieves,' he said. 'I earn only $2,500 Zimbabwe a month (about \u00a350). My children are hungry. I hope I will be excited by next week. I hope this is our new Independence Day - when we are free of Mugabe.'</p> <p>Asked whether he thought other people would vote for Mugabe because they shared his dislike of whites, Rusike replied: 'No. We are like flowers. All different colours of flower can live in the same garden.'</p> <p>Albert Phiri, 53, a banker, stood in a queue of more than 500 people at another polling booth in Chitungwiza, a township outside Harare, which has been the scene of mass demonstrations and riots over the country's worsening economy. 'All this stuff about race and land is rubbish. We want change. We want to be modern. Mugabe and his people are dinosaurs. They have no place in a modern world. The old ways must be put in the dustbin for ever.'</p> <p>Such comments caused a ripple of delight at MDC headquarters yesterday. From rented offices in a city-centre shopping mall, the opposition have spent the last two months campaigning vigorously on behalf of Morgan Tsvangirai, a former leader of the Zimbabwean trade congress, who was imprisoned by Mugabe for six weeks in 1989 on suspicion of being a South African spy.</p> <p>Aware of international interest in the fate of a country once hailed as an inspiration for all of Africa, the MDC spent much of last week issuing statements about the latest outbreak of violence and organising for camera crews to witness the atrocities.</p> <p>The strategy outraged Mugabe, who attacked the foreign media for being pro-MDC. He accused local journalists, who had dared to question the government's record, of not being 'sufficiently loyal'.</p> <p>Buoyed by opinion polls showing the MDC nudging ahead, officials were yesterday already anticipating Mugabe's demise. 'The first thing I am going to do is have the world's largest sale of Mercedes,' said Eddie Cross, who has been promised the post of treasury minister in Tsyangirai's new government. 'I believe we will win a landslide. Mugabe will be forced to resign. We will not put him in jail if he admits to his crimes. We will offer amnesty to all those involved in the violence as long as they tell us what they have done.'</p> <p>The winner of Zimbabwe's complicated voting system is expected to be declared early this week. As president, Mugabe has powers to appoint 30 seats in the 150-strong parliament. The remaining 120 seats are contested by ballot box. Privately, MDC officials predict they could win as many as 94 seats, a move that would force the president to stand down.</p> <p>This would prove humiliating for Mugabe and Grace, 36, the president's high-living second wife. Many diplomats chart the decline in Mugabe's fortunes to the day he married his former secretary in 1996, four years after the death from kidney failure of his first wife Sally, a woman revered by the people for her work with the poor.</p> <p>He had already fathered a child with Grace during his marriage to Sally, who had supported him throughout his years in prison and exile. Following the death of his mother - his father had deserted the family soon after Mugabe's birth - Sally became the most important woman in Mugabe's life, urging him to fight against oppression. They were apart while he oversaw the bush war that defeated Ian Smith's government, leaving the way clear for his election.</p> <p>His current problems would have been unthinkable then. Under his leadership, Zimbabwe became one of the most prosperous countries on the continent. The sale of precious rocks and food, grown in one of the most fertile climates in the world, earns vast amounts in foreign currency. When the war ended, tourists started flocking into the country to view the abundant game and other attractions such as the Victoria Falls.</p> <p>Ordinary Zimbabweans were not impressed when they learned that Mugabe's marriage to Grace had cost \u00a31.5m. Nor were they pleased to learn of his trips abroad with his new wife, frequently flying on a jet commandeered from the state airline to fly on shopping trips to London and Cape Town. There was more anger when independent local newspapers published details of the five homes he was building for Grace and her relatives using taxpayers' money, meant to pay for cheap urban homes for impoverished blacks.</p> <p>'He is utterly obsessed with this woman and cannot make the most simple decision unless she gives the go-ahead,' one former aide was quoted as saying. 'A lot of us date Bob's decline to the death of Sally. Perhaps we blame Grace because she is a woman and we dare not face the fact that we've always followed a madman - a dictator.'</p> <p>The economy has collapsed this year. Inflation is currently running at 60 per cent, compared with 15 per cent five years ago. Unemployment in some areas is as high as 70 per cent. Mugabe's decision to send 12,000 troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo has not helped. He agreed to the request for help from Laurent Kabila, a former nightclub owner from Dar Es Salam, and now the country's president, who is fighting rebels for control of diamond fields in his country. Some economists estimate the on-going war is costing up to \u00a310m a month.</p> <p>Yet Mugabe had lost none of his fight last week. Despite international pressure to allow monitors into the country to gauge whether the elections are free and fair, his officials were less than helpful, trying to slow down their movements with bureaucratic hitches.</p> <p>At the same time, the Central Intelligence Organisation (CI0) - a 2,000 strong secret police force with thousands of paid informants throughout the country - held a series of meetings with Zanu supporters and told them they must ensure MDC supporters are too scared to vote.</p> <p>Hundreds of people were dragged from farms after co-workers informed on them in return for a \u00a34 bounty. According to intelligence sources and human rights groups, some of those captured were taken to 're-education' camps, where they were beaten and forced to sing pro-Mugabe songs throughout the night.</p> <p>The testimony was backed up by farm workers interviewed in Hwedza, scene of some of the worst disturbances. Ian Douvenaga, who owns a tobacco farm, told how he watched as a 200-strong gang of Zanu supporters took 30 of his labourers from the property on Friday. 'They were rounded up like cattle,' he said.</p> <p>Simo Suza, 54, was beaten with a motorcyle chain and made to chant Zanu songs and repeat Mugabe's name. 'They said they would borrow my head if I voted for MDC,' he said. 'I went to the police after I had been treated in hospital. They did not want to know.'</p> <p>Diplomatic sources believe vote-rigging and intimidation could see the opposition failing to win a majority.

'We will have to decide whether to declare the elections null and void by next week. But that could create a civil war. It is very difficult.'</p> <p>Mugabe spent the weekend with Grace awaiting the outcome of the poll, which most observers believe will be excruciatingly close. Not that the prospect of defeat will prove too troublesome for the country's current leader. As the stars came out over Harare last night, Jonathon Moyo, Mugabe's official spokesman, dismissed the prospect of the couple being thrown out of State House, resplendent among the poverty of the capital. 'Remember: there are no rules,' Moyo said. 'The president can make any law he likes. Whatever happens, the government will be formed by Robert Mugabe. You can be sure of that.'</p> <p><b>The Mugabe years: from liberty to turmoil in two decades</b><br> <b> 18 April 1980</b> <br>Zimbabwe becomes independent. Robert Mugabe is sworn in as Prime Minister after the first multi-racial, majority rule elections in the country. He promises racial reconciliation and embarks on plans to improve health, education and living standards for the country's black population.</p> <p><b> June 1983</b> <br>Mugabe sends the army's Fifth Brigade into the southern Matabeleland provinces to quell a small-scale rebellion by supporters of opposition leader Joshua Nkomo. More than 10,000 Ndebele civilians are killed. The massacres divide Zimbabwe along ethnic lines between the Ndebele (20 per cent of the population) and the Shona (75 per cent).</p> <p><b> 22 December 1987</b> <br>Mugabe and Nkomo agree to merge their two nationalist parties. Mugabe and his Zanu-PF party are dominant. Although Nkomo becomes Vice-President and other Ndebeles join the cabinet, the Matabeleland provinces languish and become the country's poorest and least developed.</p> <p><b> January 1990</b> <br>With economic stagnation and growing unemployment, the Mugabe government embarks on an economic programme sponsored by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Rather than cut military spending, he reduces expenditure on health and education.</p> <p><b> 17 November 1997</b> <br> Veterans of the war against Rhodesian rule press Mugabe for large 'gratuities' and pensions. Despite an already large budget deficit, Mugabe agrees to pay out Z$5 billion. Already in economic crisis, Zimbabwe's dollar crashes, heralding drastic economic decline.</p> <p><b> August 1998</b> <br>Mugabe deploys 13,000 troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo to prop up threatened President Laurent Kabila. The war is estimated to cost more than US$400 million per year. While some 600 Zimbabweans die and the distant and murky war is highly unpopular, Mugabe, cabinet ministers and army generals benefit from lucrative contracts and diamond mining deals. The war exacerbates Zimbabwe's economic crisis, causing fuel shortages.</p> <p><b> 15 February 2000</b> <br>Zimbabwean voters reject Mugabe's proposed constitution, which would have entrenched his presidential powers. Despite public hearings in which citizens called for a reduction of his powers, the draft constitution effectively maintains a one-party state. The defeat of the constitutional referendum shocks Mugabe and his party.</p> <p><b> March 2000</b> <br>Mugabe backs war veterans and other Zanu-PF supporters who invade 1,400 mostly white-owned farms. They say they are eradicating the Rhodesian colonial legacy and reclaiming African land, but the farm invasions are ruled illegal by Zimbabwe's courts and are marked by violence against supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. Mugabe leads a violent campaign for the parliamentary elections in which 32 opposition members are killed.</p>",

The massacres divide Zimbabwe along ethnic lines between the Ndebele (20 per cent of the population) and the Shona (75 per cent). 22 December 1987 Mugabe and Nkomo agree to merge their two nationalist parties. Mugabe and his Zanu-PF party are dominant. Although Nkomo becomes Vice-President and other Ndebeles join the cabinet, the Matabeleland provinces languish and become the country's poorest and least developed. January 1990 With economic stagnation and growing unemployment, the Mugabe government embarks on an economic programme sponsored by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Rather than cut military spending, he reduces expenditure on health and education. 17 November 1997 Veterans of the war against Rhodesian rule press Mugabe for large 'gratuities' and pensions. Despite an already large budget deficit, Mugabe agrees to pay out Z$5 billion. Already in economic crisis, Zimbabwe's dollar crashes, heralding drastic economic decline. August 1998 Mugabe deploys 13,000 troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo to prop up threatened President Laurent Kabila. The war is estimated to cost more than US$400 million per year. While some 600 Zimbabweans die and the distant and murky war is highly unpopular, Mugabe, cabinet ministers and army generals benefit from lucrative contracts and diamond mining deals. The war exacerbates Zimbabwe's economic crisis, causing fuel shortages. 15 February 2000 Zimbabwean voters reject Mugabe's proposed constitution, which would have entrenched his presidential powers. Despite public hearings in which citizens called for a reduction of his powers, the draft constitution effectively maintains a one-party state. The defeat of the constitutional referendum shocks Mugabe and his party. March 2000 Mugabe backs war veterans and other Zanu-PF supporters who invade 1,400 mostly white-owned farms. They say they are eradicating the Rhodesian colonial legacy and reclaiming African land, but the farm invasions are ruled illegal by Zimbabwe's courts and are marked by violence against supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. Mugabe leads a violent campaign for the parliamentary elections in which 32 opposition members are killed.",

      "body": "<p>The relationship was beautiful while it lasted. There was the fresh, young prime minister with that knockout parliamentary majority, bursting with vigour but lacking experience. There was the older man, his dwindling interest in British politics rekindled by the excitement of finding this youthful soul-mate, eager to tutor the nubile virgin in the ways of power. They seemed made for each other.</p> <p>Tony Blair and Roy Jenkins romanced over lunches at Chequers, intimate dinners at Number 10, and cosy tete-\u00e0-tetes in the Prime Minister's study. Tony found Labour politicians of Roy's vintage rather avuncularly patronising. Roy was witty, wise and had a flatteringly high estimation of Tony. The older man believed that the younger man would fulfil his unrequited passions. The two had good-natured arguments about which of them invented the phrase 'radical century'. But the desire to heal the breach between Labour and the Liberal Democrats to construct a progressive coalition which would dominate the twenty-first century seemed to be mutual. So, too, did an enthusiasm to place Britain at the heart of Europe</p> <p>Time passed. Tony continued to whisper soft words, but Roy became frustrated that they never reached consumation. He presented Tony with a most handsome, hand-crafted report recommending a new voting system for Westminster. Tony, who was never less than polite, said it looked nice. Then he stuck it at the back of his sock drawer.</p> <p>As for Europe, Roy kept nagging and writing to Tony telling him to be more positive. Tony pleaded he would like to be, but Gordon wouldn't let him. Gordon Brown! Always the problem. Gordon was cool towards Europe, and cold about proportional representation. Then, he went on a rampage against \u00e9litism and trashed Roy's beloved Oxford University. Roy told Tony he would never get an honorary degree after that. He was Thatchered. So there. He shared some of his pain with the Spectator, telling the magazine's agony aunt, Boris Johnson that Tony is a 'second rate mind'. So it all ends in tears.</p> <p>Not quite. What I would next expect is the Prime Minister to swiftly kiss and make-up with Lord Jenkins, who says he still regards Tony as a 'very agreeable companion'. Tony will be sending an invitation to dinner even now, if it has not plopped on Roy's doormat already. That was certainly what happened last time Roy had a little outburst of disappointment with the younger man.</p> <p>We can also have a pretty good guess at what Mr Blair will say to his old friend, because it is what he has been saying for more than three years now to everyone who grows impatient with his failure to give a stronger lead on Europe or make a decision about changing the voting system.</p> <p>Give me time is the nub of his reassurances. When the stars have moved into a favourable constellation and the moon is pulling the tide in the right direction, then he will announce himself in unequivocal colours for the single currency. As he said last week: 'If I recommend to the British people that we join the euro, I will make the case for it as strongly and powerfully as you could possibly hear.' Dazzled by the sheer force of Mr Blair's persuasive abilities, the current two to one majority against the single currency will be converted into an endorsement of the euro. Just like that.</p> <p>I am sure the Prime Minister believes this. So why does such a previously ardent admirer as Lord Jenkins now doubt him? Mr Blair will have to jump several fences which he has previously shied from, and one which he has not had to bother about before. The Cabinet has so far been excluded from all the big economic decisions. The Bank of England was given its independence and the suck-it-and-see policy towards the euro adopted, without a debate, never mind a vote, around the top table. John Prescott tells us that it will be different when it comes to the single currency. His assertion that the Cabinet will decide is not just meant as a rebuke to Gordon Brown's claim that the Treasury is the sole judge of the famous five tests, but also as a warning to the Prime Minister.</p> <p>Still, if Brown and Blair were agreed, I'd expect them to overcome any Cabinet opposition to entering the single currency. But will they agree? The dispute between them boils down to economics versus politics.</p> <p>For Blair, joining the euro is the golden swipecard that finally opens the door to the throneroom of Europe. Despite the tactical victory over the withholding tax, strategically the prime minister is not fulfilling his self-perceived destiny to be a leader in Europe. He is trying to resist the Franco-German push for a fast-track \u00e9lite. We can't, protests the prime minister, have a Europe of 'two speeds'. But as his friend - or should this also be former friend? - Gerhard Schr\u00f6der correctly says, there are already two speeds on the eurobahn: those who are in the single currency, and those who are not. The prime minister cannot look forward to the day when he is still on the hard shoulder while the Greeks have joined the acceleration lane.</p> <p>The idea of joining the single currency to satisfy the prime minister's political urges is privately regarded with contempt by the Chancellor. Gordon Brown is deadly serious about meeting the economic tests of which he proclaims the Treasury to be 'the guardian'. That's not to say that calculations about power don't also consume Brown and all the time. His quest to become prime minister isn't hurt by his current hero status among the Europhobic press. What could utterly destroy his ambitions for the succession is a referendum on the euro which is lost. It would be a potentially mortal blow, and certainly a savage one, to his credibility as well that of the prime minister.</p> <p>That brings us to the highest hurdle that Tony Blair will have to get over, which is himself. The prime minister is not going to persuade the country to make the leap until he has the courage to make one himself. Au fond, as Roy Jenkins would say, Blair did not hold a referendum just after the election because even when he was immensely popular he did not think he would win it. It wasn't worth gambling the second term on the single currency. This Prime Minister is capable of taking great gambles for large rewards, as he demonstrated most notably in Northern Ireland and Kosovo. But crab-like caution has been his more abiding characteristic. The only previous time that comes to mind when he made a vault of faith in the face of public and media hostility was the Millennium Dome. That is not an auspicious precedent.</p> <p>Is Tony Blair likely to feel more or less courageous after the next election when he will have a smaller majority and face a more potent Tory Party?</p> <p>He will still insist that he was right not to call a referendum on the euro immediately after the last election. What he has been heard to express private sighs of semi-regret about is that he missed the moment to fulfil the other half of The Project by forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. I am sure that when he tells Lord Jenkins this, it is not just to string the older man along. The Prime Minister is genuinely still interested in changing the voting system for Westminster, a sincerity which deepens the closer we get to an election, after which he might need Charles Kennedy and the Lib Dems. The hurdles to be crossed are almost identical to those in the case of the euro: a referendum with an unpredictable outcome; the right-wing press; John Prescott and Gordon Brown; and the Prime Minister's own divided mind.</p> <p>At least, unlike the euro, there is a Third Way. The Prime Minister is talking warmly, in private, about the Alternative Vote. It would have worked at the last election to smash the Conservatives even more thoroughly. AV is not proportional; it actually tends to exaggerate the swing. For all these reasons, my Lord Jenkins rejected it when he composed his fine report on electoral reform.</p> <p>I fear Roy may be let down once again by Tony.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The relationship was beautiful while it lasted. There was the fresh, young prime minister with that knockout parliamentary majority, bursting with vigour but lacking experience. There was the older man, his dwindling interest in British politics rekindled by the excitement of finding this youthful soul-mate, eager to tutor the nubile virgin in the ways of power. They seemed made for each other. Tony Blair and Roy Jenkins romanced over lunches at Chequers, intimate dinners at Number 10, and cosy tete-\u00e0-tetes in the Prime Minister's study. Tony found Labour politicians of Roy's vintage rather avuncularly patronising. Roy was witty, wise and had a flatteringly high estimation of Tony. The older man believed that the younger man would fulfil his unrequited passions. The two had good-natured arguments about which of them invented the phrase 'radical century'. But the desire to heal the breach between Labour and the Liberal Democrats to construct a progressive coalition which would dominate the twenty-first century seemed to be mutual. So, too, did an enthusiasm to place Britain at the heart of Europe Time passed. Tony continued to whisper soft words, but Roy became frustrated that they never reached consumation. He presented Tony with a most handsome, hand-crafted report recommending a new voting system for Westminster. Tony, who was never less than polite, said it looked nice. Then he stuck it at the back of his sock drawer. As for Europe, Roy kept nagging and writing to Tony telling him to be more positive. Tony pleaded he would like to be, but Gordon wouldn't let him. Gordon Brown! Always the problem. Gordon was cool towards Europe, and cold about proportional representation. Then, he went on a rampage against \u00e9litism and trashed Roy's beloved Oxford University. Roy told Tony he would never get an honorary degree after that. He was Thatchered. So there. He shared some of his pain with the Spectator, telling the magazine's agony aunt, Boris Johnson that Tony is a 'second rate mind'. So it all ends in tears. Not quite. What I would next expect is the Prime Minister to swiftly kiss and make-up with Lord Jenkins, who says he still regards Tony as a 'very agreeable companion'. Tony will be sending an invitation to dinner even now, if it has not plopped on Roy's doormat already. That was certainly what happened last time Roy had a little outburst of disappointment with the younger man. We can also have a pretty good guess at what Mr Blair will say to his old friend, because it is what he has been saying for more than three years now to everyone who grows impatient with his failure to give a stronger lead on Europe or make a decision about changing the voting system. Give me time is the nub of his reassurances. When the stars have moved into a favourable constellation and the moon is pulling the tide in the right direction, then he will announce himself in unequivocal colours for the single currency. As he said last week: 'If I recommend to the British people that we join the euro, I will make the case for it as strongly and powerfully as you could possibly hear.' Dazzled by the sheer force of Mr Blair's persuasive abilities, the current two to one majority against the single currency will be converted into an endorsement of the euro. Just like that. I am sure the Prime Minister believes this. So why does such a previously ardent admirer as Lord Jenkins now doubt him? Mr Blair will have to jump several fences which he has previously shied from, and one which he has not had to bother about before. The Cabinet has so far been excluded from all the big economic decisions. The Bank of England was given its independence and the suck-it-and-see policy towards the euro adopted, without a debate, never mind a vote, around the top table. John Prescott tells us that it will be different when it comes to the single currency. His assertion that the Cabinet will decide is not just meant as a rebuke to Gordon Brown's claim that the Treasury is the sole judge of the famous five tests, but also as a warning to the Prime Minister. Still, if Brown and Blair were agreed, I'd expect them to overcome any Cabinet opposition to entering the single currency. But will they agree? The dispute between them boils down to economics versus politics. For Blair, joining the euro is the golden swipecard that finally opens the door to the throneroom of Europe. Despite the tactical victory over the withholding tax, strategically the prime minister is not fulfilling his self-perceived destiny to be a leader in Europe. He is trying to resist the Franco-German push for a fast-track \u00e9lite. We can't, protests the prime minister, have a Europe of 'two speeds'. But as his friend - or should this also be former friend? - Gerhard Schr\u00f6der correctly says, there are already two speeds on the eurobahn: those who are in the single currency, and those who are not. The prime minister cannot look forward to the day when he is still on the hard shoulder while the Greeks have joined the acceleration lane. The idea of joining the single currency to satisfy the prime minister's political urges is privately regarded with contempt by the Chancellor. Gordon Brown is deadly serious about meeting the economic tests of which he proclaims the Treasury to be 'the guardian'. That's not to say that calculations about power don't also consume Brown and all the time. His quest to become prime minister isn't hurt by his current hero status among the Europhobic press. What could utterly destroy his ambitions for the succession is a referendum on the euro which is lost. It would be a potentially mortal blow, and certainly a savage one, to his credibility as well that of the prime minister. That brings us to the highest hurdle that Tony Blair will have to get over, which is himself. The prime minister is not going to persuade the country to make the leap until he has the courage to make one himself. Au fond, as Roy Jenkins would say, Blair did not hold a referendum just after the election because even when he was immensely popular he did not think he would win it. It wasn't worth gambling the second term on the single currency. This Prime Minister is capable of taking great gambles for large rewards, as he demonstrated most notably in Northern Ireland and Kosovo. But crab-like caution has been his more abiding characteristic. The only previous time that comes to mind when he made a vault of faith in the face of public and media hostility was the Millennium Dome. That is not an auspicious precedent. Is Tony Blair likely to feel more or less courageous after the next election when he will have a smaller majority and face a more potent Tory Party? He will still insist that he was right not to call a referendum on the euro immediately after the last election. What he has been heard to express private sighs of semi-regret about is that he missed the moment to fulfil the other half of The Project by forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. I am sure that when he tells Lord Jenkins this, it is not just to string the older man along. The Prime Minister is genuinely still interested in changing the voting system for Westminster, a sincerity which deepens the closer we get to an election, after which he might need Charles Kennedy and the Lib Dems. The hurdles to be crossed are almost identical to those in the case of the euro: a referendum with an unpredictable outcome; the right-wing press; John Prescott and Gordon Brown; and the Prime Minister's own divided mind. At least, unlike the euro, there is a Third Way. The Prime Minister is talking warmly, in private, about the Alternative Vote. It would have worked at the last election to smash the Conservatives even more thoroughly. AV is not proportional; it actually tends to exaggerate the swing. For all these reasons, my Lord Jenkins rejected it when he composed his fine report on electoral reform. I fear Roy may be let down once again by Tony.",

      "body": "<p>On a warm autumnal day in September 1997 Tony and Cherie Blair made their way to St Peter's Parish Church in Brighton. The mood was positive on that Sunday, and Millbank, keen to ride the wave of euphoria that had greeted Blair's victory in May, decided that it was time for some good publicity.</p> <p>Photographers and television camera crews were discreetly invited to the church and asked to be in position before the Blairs arrived. They expected a few shots near the door. But the Labour Party official wanted more. No, come in, he said. Take some pictures of them inside the church. You can stand on the pews if you like, to get better shots.</p> <p>The following day the pictures appeared across the front pages - the Blairs at worship, he in dark grey suit with white shirt and black and gold check tie, she in smart black suit. In the background the stained glass windows could clearly be seen.</p> <p>The picture said everything about Blair and religion - the awkwardness at having a media scrum pile into the church after him and the knowledge that Christianity makes up a deeply-held part of his beliefs and should not be hidden.</p> <p>It also says much about Britain's relationship with religion. Largely unspoken, politicians know that they play the Christianity card at their peril. Play it too hard and voters believe you are trying to exploit God. Blair has suffered from a perception that his politics is of the 'holier-than-thou' variety.</p> <p>But don't play it at all and you risk falling into the trap of vacuity, with talk of 'community' and 'values' which lacks the essential religious underpinning. 'We know that Blair has sincere beliefs but he doesn't articulate them,' said John Wilkins, editor of the Catholic newspaper, the Tablet. 'That makes it difficult to understand his vision.'</p> <p>On Friday in the small southern German town of T\u00fcbingen, Blair will take a calculated risk at changing that perception. He will speak in front of an overtly religious audience. He will talk about ethics and community values as the guest of one of Europe's most challenging religious figures - Hans K\u00fcng, the Swiss radical theologian who is known as the Catholic who dared fall out with the Vatican. K\u00fcng is one of Blair's religious mentors and the meeting will cement their relationship.</p> <p>Some British government officials based in Germany have raised eyebrows at the politics of the meeting. Last week William Hague invited the right-wing American professor, Marvin Olasky, to guide his party's thinking on 'compassionate Conservatism'. His arrival sparked a flurry of comment and analysis on the role of religion in British politics. Could Olasky, who argues that benefits should be given only to those who deserve it, really have anything to add to the British political debate? Blair stayed out of the fray. This week he will enter it and the spotlight will turn from Olasky to K\u00fcng.</p> <p>Blair and K\u00fcng first met last year after Blair had expressed an interest in K\u00fcng's writings on global ethics. The Prime Minister will deliver the first in a series of lectures organised by the 72-year-old's Global Ethics Foundation, which is committed to linking human rights with clearly defined responsibilities. K\u00fcng, who has been in conflict with the Catholic Church for more than 20 years, clearly believes that Blair is just the man to lead the ethical charge.</p> <p>'He knew me first by my books, especially my book On Being a Christian, and I met him in London,' K\u00fcng said last week. 'I was very much impressed by his very serious commitment in the Northern Ireland peace process, which was only possible because he committed himself personally.'</p> <p>K\u00fcng, whose other books include Does God Exist? and Yes to a Global Ethic , acknowledges that believers do not have a monopoly on ethics. But he is convinced that religious faith is an advantage for a political leader.</p> <p>Acclaimed as one of the most brilliant Catholic thinkers of his generation, K\u00fcng was an adviser to the Second Vatican Council in 1962, but his liberal views on birth control and human sexuality brought him into conflict with the authorities. When he questioned the infallibility of the Pope in 1979, the Church withdrew his permission to teach theology but he remained a professor in T\u00fcbingen, adored by liberal Catholics, especially in Germany.</p> <p>'I am still a Catholic priest in good standing. I can say Mass and preach and, being an emeritus now means it doesn't matter whether I have this canonical approval,' he said. He counts Henry Kissinger, Germany's former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, former US President Jimmy Carter and Lord Callaghan among his friends and admirers. His foundation, which has produced films and a television series as well as books and academic papers, is funded by an aristocratic industrialist, Count Karl Konrad von der Gr\u00f6ben.</p> <p>K\u00fcng believes that human rights are directly linked to responsibilities and that, instead of a culture of human rights, the developed world has created 'a perverse culture based on exaggerated claims' where individual rights are played off against one another. Although he maintains that everyone is entitled to certain fundamental rights, he supports tough policies on such issues as unemployment benefits.</p> <p>'Human dignity consists of both, to have rights and responsibilities. If somebody just does not want to work because he is lazy, then it is not a fundamental human right to be lazy and to be protected in his laziness,' he said. K\u00fcng favours Blair's 'working hard for hard-working familes' and 'no rights without responsibilities' mantras. There is no doubt about the warmth of the theologian's approval for Blair.</p> <p>'He and his wife, one Anglican and one Catholic, they had from the beginning a certain ethical approach to life, rooted in religion, and I think that's already one guarantee,' K\u00fcng said.

      "bodyText": "On a warm autumnal day in September 1997 Tony and Cherie Blair made their way to St Peter's Parish Church in Brighton. The mood was positive on that Sunday, and Millbank, keen to ride the wave of euphoria that had greeted Blair's victory in May, decided that it was time for some good publicity. Photographers and television camera crews were discreetly invited to the church and asked to be in position before the Blairs arrived. They expected a few shots near the door. But the Labour Party official wanted more. No, come in, he said. Take some pictures of them inside the church. You can stand on the pews if you like, to get better shots. The following day the pictures appeared across the front pages - the Blairs at worship, he in dark grey suit with white shirt and black and gold check tie, she in smart black suit. In the background the stained glass windows could clearly be seen. The picture said everything about Blair and religion - the awkwardness at having a media scrum pile into the church after him and the knowledge that Christianity makes up a deeply-held part of his beliefs and should not be hidden. It also says much about Britain's relationship with religion. Largely unspoken, politicians know that they play the Christianity card at their peril. Play it too hard and voters believe you are trying to exploit God. Blair has suffered from a perception that his politics is of the 'holier-than-thou' variety. But don't play it at all and you risk falling into the trap of vacuity, with talk of 'community' and 'values' which lacks the essential religious underpinning. 'We know that Blair has sincere beliefs but he doesn't articulate them,' said John Wilkins, editor of the Catholic newspaper, the Tablet. 'That makes it difficult to understand his vision.' On Friday in the small southern German town of T\u00fcbingen, Blair will take a calculated risk at changing that perception. He will speak in front of an overtly religious audience. He will talk about ethics and community values as the guest of one of Europe's most challenging religious figures - Hans K\u00fcng, the Swiss radical theologian who is known as the Catholic who dared fall out with the Vatican. K\u00fcng is one of Blair's religious mentors and the meeting will cement their relationship. Some British government officials based in Germany have raised eyebrows at the politics of the meeting. Last week William Hague invited the right-wing American professor, Marvin Olasky, to guide his party's thinking on 'compassionate Conservatism'. His arrival sparked a flurry of comment and analysis on the role of religion in British politics. Could Olasky, who argues that benefits should be given only to those who deserve it, really have anything to add to the British political debate? Blair stayed out of the fray. This week he will enter it and the spotlight will turn from Olasky to K\u00fcng. Blair and K\u00fcng first met last year after Blair had expressed an interest in K\u00fcng's writings on global ethics. The Prime Minister will deliver the first in a series of lectures organised by the 72-year-old's Global Ethics Foundation, which is committed to linking human rights with clearly defined responsibilities. K\u00fcng, who has been in conflict with the Catholic Church for more than 20 years, clearly believes that Blair is just the man to lead the ethical charge. 'He knew me first by my books, especially my book On Being a Christian, and I met him in London,' K\u00fcng said last week. 'I was very much impressed by his very serious commitment in the Northern Ireland peace process, which was only possible because he committed himself personally.' K\u00fcng, whose other books include Does God Exist? and Yes to a Global Ethic , acknowledges that believers do not have a monopoly on ethics. But he is convinced that religious faith is an advantage for a political leader. Acclaimed as one of the most brilliant Catholic thinkers of his generation, K\u00fcng was an adviser to the Second Vatican Council in 1962, but his liberal views on birth control and human sexuality brought him into conflict with the authorities. When he questioned the infallibility of the Pope in 1979, the Church withdrew his permission to teach theology but he remained a professor in T\u00fcbingen, adored by liberal Catholics, especially in Germany. 'I am still a Catholic priest in good standing. I can say Mass and preach and, being an emeritus now means it doesn't matter whether I have this canonical approval,' he said. He counts Henry Kissinger, Germany's former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, former US President Jimmy Carter and Lord Callaghan among his friends and admirers. His foundation, which has produced films and a television series as well as books and academic papers, is funded by an aristocratic industrialist, Count Karl Konrad von der Gr\u00f6ben. K\u00fcng believes that human rights are directly linked to responsibilities and that, instead of a culture of human rights, the developed world has created 'a perverse culture based on exaggerated claims' where individual rights are played off against one another. Although he maintains that everyone is entitled to certain fundamental rights, he supports tough policies on such issues as unemployment benefits. 'Human dignity consists of both, to have rights and responsibilities. If somebody just does not want to work because he is lazy, then it is not a fundamental human right to be lazy and to be protected in his laziness,' he said. K\u00fcng favours Blair's 'working hard for hard-working familes' and 'no rights without responsibilities' mantras. There is no doubt about the warmth of the theologian's approval for Blair. 'He and his wife, one Anglican and one Catholic, they had from the beginning a certain ethical approach to life, rooted in religion, and I think that's already one guarantee,' K\u00fcng said. 'When he told me that it is intolerable that in the 21st century we still have fights and battles between Catholics and Protestants in one part of Europe, I think he is passionately committed to this. I think if you compare him with his predecessor, you see the whole difference.' Blair and the Labour Party's relationship with religion has always been a difficult one. In 1996 Blair wrote an article in the Sunday Telegraph, saying: 'I can't stand politicians who wear God on their sleeves; I do not pretend to be any better or less selfish than anyone else, I do not believe that Christians should only vote Labour.' But he stirred up a hornets' nest of controversy when he continued: 'My view of Christian values led me to oppose what I perceived to be the narrow view of self-interest that Conservatism - particularly its modern, more right-wing form - represents.' The right-wing press called for Blair's head, accusing him of trying to play the God card to his own advantage. Simon Heffer, in the Daily Mail, called Blair 'naive' and asserted that his 'grasp of theology is at an elementary level of philosophy'. In his 1995 conference speech Blair spoke about the need for spiritual renewal and the need to bring the soul and morality back into politics. His T\u00fcbingen speech next Friday, it is believed, will draw heavily on his Third Way philosophy of traditional community values in a modern setting.

      "body": "<p>Like many villages in the south-eastern provinces of China, Fuquing has seen changes in the past few years. Now there are concrete pavements and a newly landscaped town square. A care and cultural centre for senior citizens has recently opened. Above the traditional squat brick houses rise six-storey mansions topped by huge white satellite dishes and full of crystal and gold.</p> <p>On a burnished plaque on the wall of a clothes shop an inscription praises a local hero: a 22-year-old who two years ago left his home to seek his fortune in Europe. He was the man who funded the street improvements. A cornerstone in the old people's centre lauds the generosity of another expatriate.</p> <p>The number of people who have left Fuquing and Changle - the nearby town that was home to most of the 54 men and four women found dead in a container lorry at Dover last Sunday - has led to the coining of a morbid nickname. Fuquing and Changle are, the locals say, 'widows' villages', a term hardly fitting the lively and increasingly wealthy little towns. But this weekend their nickname has never seemed so apposite.</p> <p>On 19 February a smartly dressed 19-year-old called Chen Lin left his Fuquing home and walked to the railway station. He took a train to Beijing, the Chinese capital, more than 1,000 miles to the north. He had a few possessions, a little money and almost no idea of what his itinerary would be. He was, close relatives told The Observer last week, entirely in the hands of the sh'e tau' - or 'snakeheads' - the local gang leaders who run the human trafficking trade. His family had paid them the equivalent of \u00a314,000 to get Chen Lin to the UK. With his death, it will take them five years to pay off the debt.</p> <p>Chen Lin's family tracked the young man's progress across Asia. At irregular intervals the 'snakes' - as clandestine emigrants are known in China - would call home. From Beijing the group were taken, by rail, to Moscow.</p> <p>Then they were moved by car, truck and even horse-drawn cart across the steppes of southern Russia, through the Ukraine and eventually, after a four-day trek over mountains, into the Czech Republic. They were driven through Germany, into Holland and ended up at Zeebrugge where they were loaded into a refrigerated lorry full of tomatoes.</p> <p>Around four hours later - when customs officials opened the rear doors at Dover - 58 were dead. Gasping under a pile of twisted corpses were two half-comatose survivors. The group had simply run out of oxygen. As they died they freed up air for others. Enough for two.</p> <p>On Friday a Dutch lorry-driver was charged by a British court with 58 counts of manslaughter and remanded in custody for a week. The Dutch owner of the company which had registered the lorry has been arrested in Holland. Two Chinese appeared in court yesterday charged with conspiracy to facilitate illegal entry to the UK. No one expects swift results, despite the resources that have been allocated to the inquiry from the Kent police team.</p> <p>But the question of responsibility for the tragedy will not be answered in the courtroom alone. Do we blame the parents who, hoping for a better life for their children, save for years to send their best and brightest to the West? Or the traffickers who, often having made the journey themselves, decide to look for faster ways to get rich than washing dishes in a restaurant? Or the Western governments who have failed to tackle the problem?</p> <p>Or, sitting in our safe European homes with an eye on the world's less fortunate and a hand on the security hardware catalogue, are we all, to some degree, responsible?</p> <p>The answer from the British Government has so far been unequivocal. The Dover tragedy was caused by criminals. A crime - nothing more, nothing less.</p> <p>The police, perhaps unsurprisingly, are at one with the Home Office line. John Abbot, head of the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) last week spoke of 'a global migration crisis'. 'People have replaced drugs as the most lucrative trade for criminal gangs... we are not talking asylum, we are talking organised crime,' he said.</p> <p>But the issue is more complex and, many experts say, requires a more sophisticated response to be brought under control. No one is under any illusions about the scale of the problem. It is thought that 400,000 people a year enter the European Union illegally. In the 12 months from March 1999 to March 2000 British officials detected 21,000 people trying to enter the UK clandestinely. In 1996 the figure was 61. And they admit they catch only a fraction.</p> <p>There are tens of thousands of illegal immigrants working in the UK. Many - particularly eastern Europeans - work on building sites or on farms. South Asians often end up in garment sweatshops. The Chinese fill the kitchens of restaurants.</p> <p>Criminals may simply be reacting more quickly than national governments to changing patterns of migration and labour demand.</p> <p>Nicolas Serri\u00e8re of the UN's International Labour Organisation, based in Geneva, said Western European countries had to rethink their immigration and asylum policy: 'Everyone is having to reconsider their current stand because they desperately need foreign workers. But most countries face intense popular resistance to an increase in immigration. Governments are in a very difficult situation.'</p> <p>When the German Social Democrat-led government said it would issue 20,000 visas to Information Technology specialists from India the German Right reacted with the slogan ' Kinder statt Inder' - Children before Indians.</p> <p>Many believe Britain and France face the same problem. Though we have a low-skill surplus we need certain highly skilled migrants badly.

      "bodyText": "Like many villages in the south-eastern provinces of China, Fuquing has seen changes in the past few years. Now there are concrete pavements and a newly landscaped town square. A care and cultural centre for senior citizens has recently opened. Above the traditional squat brick houses rise six-storey mansions topped by huge white satellite dishes and full of crystal and gold. On a burnished plaque on the wall of a clothes shop an inscription praises a local hero: a 22-year-old who two years ago left his home to seek his fortune in Europe. He was the man who funded the street improvements. A cornerstone in the old people's centre lauds the generosity of another expatriate. The number of people who have left Fuquing and Changle - the nearby town that was home to most of the 54 men and four women found dead in a container lorry at Dover last Sunday - has led to the coining of a morbid nickname. Fuquing and Changle are, the locals say, 'widows' villages', a term hardly fitting the lively and increasingly wealthy little towns. But this weekend their nickname has never seemed so apposite. On 19 February a smartly dressed 19-year-old called Chen Lin left his Fuquing home and walked to the railway station. He took a train to Beijing, the Chinese capital, more than 1,000 miles to the north. He had a few possessions, a little money and almost no idea of what his itinerary would be. He was, close relatives told The Observer last week, entirely in the hands of the sh'e tau' - or 'snakeheads' - the local gang leaders who run the human trafficking trade. His family had paid them the equivalent of \u00a314,000 to get Chen Lin to the UK. With his death, it will take them five years to pay off the debt. Chen Lin's family tracked the young man's progress across Asia. At irregular intervals the 'snakes' - as clandestine emigrants are known in China - would call home. From Beijing the group were taken, by rail, to Moscow. Then they were moved by car, truck and even horse-drawn cart across the steppes of southern Russia, through the Ukraine and eventually, after a four-day trek over mountains, into the Czech Republic. They were driven through Germany, into Holland and ended up at Zeebrugge where they were loaded into a refrigerated lorry full of tomatoes. Around four hours later - when customs officials opened the rear doors at Dover - 58 were dead. Gasping under a pile of twisted corpses were two half-comatose survivors. The group had simply run out of oxygen. As they died they freed up air for others. Enough for two. On Friday a Dutch lorry-driver was charged by a British court with 58 counts of manslaughter and remanded in custody for a week. The Dutch owner of the company which had registered the lorry has been arrested in Holland. Two Chinese appeared in court yesterday charged with conspiracy to facilitate illegal entry to the UK. No one expects swift results, despite the resources that have been allocated to the inquiry from the Kent police team. But the question of responsibility for the tragedy will not be answered in the courtroom alone. Do we blame the parents who, hoping for a better life for their children, save for years to send their best and brightest to the West? Or the traffickers who, often having made the journey themselves, decide to look for faster ways to get rich than washing dishes in a restaurant? Or the Western governments who have failed to tackle the problem? Or, sitting in our safe European homes with an eye on the world's less fortunate and a hand on the security hardware catalogue, are we all, to some degree, responsible? The answer from the British Government has so far been unequivocal. The Dover tragedy was caused by criminals. A crime - nothing more, nothing less. The police, perhaps unsurprisingly, are at one with the Home Office line. John Abbot, head of the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) last week spoke of 'a global migration crisis'. 'People have replaced drugs as the most lucrative trade for criminal gangs... we are not talking asylum, we are talking organised crime,' he said. But the issue is more complex and, many experts say, requires a more sophisticated response to be brought under control. No one is under any illusions about the scale of the problem. It is thought that 400,000 people a year enter the European Union illegally. In the 12 months from March 1999 to March 2000 British officials detected 21,000 people trying to enter the UK clandestinely. In 1996 the figure was 61. And they admit they catch only a fraction. There are tens of thousands of illegal immigrants working in the UK. Many - particularly eastern Europeans - work on building sites or on farms. South Asians often end up in garment sweatshops. The Chinese fill the kitchens of restaurants. Criminals may simply be reacting more quickly than national governments to changing patterns of migration and labour demand. Nicolas Serri\u00e8re of the UN's International Labour Organisation, based in Geneva, said Western European countries had to rethink their immigration and asylum policy: 'Everyone is having to reconsider their current stand because they desperately need foreign workers. But most countries face intense popular resistance to an increase in immigration. Governments are in a very difficult situation.' When the German Social Democrat-led government said it would issue 20,000 visas to Information Technology specialists from India the German Right reacted with the slogan ' Kinder statt Inder' - Children before Indians. Many believe Britain and France face the same problem. Though we have a low-skill surplus we need certain highly skilled migrants badly. 'If you have certain skills you can almost walk into the country without signing anything - we are so keen to have you,' said Philip Trott, a solicitor specialising in immigration law. 'It is becoming increasingly obvious that we have to tailor our immigration policy more closely to our needs. We have to wake up to the realisation that we do need immigrants.' Foreign Office Ministers have visited India's 'Silicon Plateau' to lure skilled workers to this country, and Education Secretary David Blunkett would like foreign students studying IT in Britain to be allowed to apply directly for jobs here. The plan is opposed by Home Secretary Jack Straw. Last month Blunkett said he would make it easier for IT workers to obtain work permits. Industry experts say 80,000 could be needed. The anti-immigration lobby argues that the need for software programmers has little bearing on the fate of three score Chinese crammed into a container. But their carping may be ill-founded. Margaret Hodge, the Minister with responsibility for equality issues, hosted a breakfast at the Department for Education and Employment recently where the big players in construction, manufacturing and transport explained the difficulties they were having filling posts. Then the Earl of Limerick, chairman of tyre company Pirelli, mentioned asylum-seekers. It was a scandal, he said, that Britain was suffering a skills crisis, while hundreds of highly qualified refugees were being refused the right to work in this country while their cases were being assessed. 'It's a terrible situation,' he told The Observer. Even the Spectator and the Daily Telegraph have urged a liberalisation of the system. Such a change may be the most effective weapon in stopping a repetition of last week's tragedy. 'The main reason illegal immigration appears to be growing is that restrictive immigration policies have increased, making it difficult for people to arrive in Europe legally,' said Dr Khalid Koser, of London University's Migration Research Centre. 'There is no doubt that these criminal gangs are now marketing themselves, telling people they will be able to get them into Europe and, because it is more difficult to get visas, they can charge higher fees.'

Fuquing authorities have now daubed the village's walls with huge slogans calling on residents to 'hit hard at illegal emigration'. Rewards have been offered in exchange for information about the snakeheads. But their efforts are unlikely to have much impact. Villagers say everyone knows who the gang leaders are: their palatial homes with tiled patios, chandeliers, spiral staircases and security gates are hardly inconspicuous. And, although there has been the odd angry protest outside the homes of the most notorious snakeheads, for the most part local people are not critical.

On air he lampooned Scots for 'talking among themselves' after 11pm. 'Well, now it's long gone 11 o'clock, children are in bed and Scots are talking about whatever they're talking about.' Paxman's comments made him a hate figure north of the border. Newspapers accused him of deliberately letting interviews drag on after 11pm so that the Scottish opt-out started up to six minutes late. But he kept up his battle. In an interview to mark Newsnight's 20th anniversary, he said: 'The thing was cooked up as a way of buying off the demand for a Scottish Six O'Clock News , and the sooner it is dead and buried the better.' Confirming the plan to ditch the opt-out, one BBC figure told The Observer : 'We wanted to give Britain's nations and regions a voice in network programmes but the Scottish Newsnight has been an untidy compromise. 'We reckon that extra minutes at the end of the BBC1 evening news - which attracts a much larger audience than Newsnight - are worth 20 minutes after 11pm on BBC2.' Friends of Paxman say he is 'sniggering very loudly' over the BBC's decision. 'He has always regarded the opt-out as a millstone around the programme's neck,' one said. 'It's great to know it's going.'",

The Seagram CEO - who has spent the past five years defying those who dismissed him as a dilettante rich kid messing with the family fortune by tripling it - suddenly started casting around for buyers and a deal that would allow the former record producer and songwriter to pursue his musical passion: setting the standards for selling tunes in the digital age.

Their water cannons and scores of black armoured transports, looking like the attack bugs from Star Wars, protected us not from the football crazies massing that evening, but from the threat of pastry. Rumour had it that Noel Godin, who once whacked Gates with a custard pie, would lead a thousand anti-globalisation bakers on a whipped-cream rampage against the summit. </p> <p>But the night before its start, the Belgians arrested Godin and 68 suspected sous-chefs. Still, a thousand pie-less demonstrators showed up, herded so far away that, from the Sheraton's banqueting room, they looked like a swarm of frustrated ants. </p> <p>Now the ants have some powerful allies. For nearly a year, in secret meetings in London, a band of lawyers from six continents have planned an unprecedented multi-national assault on corporate monopolies. It's all big guns, including Princess Diana's lawyers, Mishcon De Reya, and the firm of David Boies, who slew Microsoft for the US Justice Department. With a bit of understandable drama, they've named themselves the Global Anti-Cartel Network. </p> <p>Last year, in an exclusive interview with The Observer , Boies caused a little storm in Microsoft's home town of Seattle by suggesting that every British purchaser of a Windows computer could claim a cash refund in US courts as a victim of Gates's monopoly. This week, the Anti-Cartel Network did just that, filing suits on behalf of those hundred million or so ants toiling on the Windows cyber- plantation outside the US. If the Network wins, expect a cheque for \u00a320 or so. (Boies, however, is sidelined from this action because of his government work.) </p> <p>Microsoft is merely the Network's first dragon. According to Mike Hausfeld of Washington, the Network's chief lawyer, the 30 law firms are about to make legal history by hitting several price-fixing monopolies with suits demanding compensation under Britain's own anti-monopoly laws. </p> <p>That's revolutionary because the right of consumers to obtain recovery from cartels is, like so many privileges under English law, constructed in such a way that no one has ever dared assert their rights. In the past 100 years the number of British consumers who have won compensation from price-fixing rings is exactly zero. </p> <p>It's the same mad story in Europe. For example, the FBI secretly filmed French and US biotech companies fixing the price of pig feed. The companies confessed and paid American customers several hundred million dollars. For Britain's bacon-munching citizens the conspirators offered two fingers and a grin. </p> <p>Time for change? The Network thinks so. Within weeks it plans to hit the crew you've suspected of rip-offs for years - the big five music companies, whom the Network alleges have conspired to keep the price of CDs above \u00a310 a disc. </p> <p>Maybe you're thinking an invasion of US lawyers into Blighty is a mixed blessing. You could, of course, leave it to HM Office of Fair Trading to protect you from corporate marauders. But how does the OFT's record look? Last month the US Federal Trade Commission forced Sony, EMI, Warner, BMG and Polygram/Universal to end market manipula tions that hiked CD prices by $2 a disc. Even the Italians fined the companies. Yet, somehow, the sleuths at the OFT found no fix at all in CD sales. One US investigator characterised the OFT's efforts thus: 'It was really so lame . I mean, it was so poorly conceived it was a chuckle . You have to laugh - it was, like, so unscientific.' </p> <p>The embarrassed OFT has now requested copies of the screaming evidence of price-fixing from US court proceedings. While this could represent an unexpected life-pulse in the old agency, it is more likely to be the eerie post-mortem twitching of a bureaucratic corpse. </p> <p>Whichever it is, the only way to get justice - and cash back on your CD and Windows purchases - is through the Network's unprecedented two-front strategy: one, to sue in London courts; the other, to sue under UK law for trial in an American courtroom. </p> <p>That's where the case of the Butcher of Croatia, Andrija Artukovich, comes into play. When Artukovich, a puppet potentate of the Nazi regime, was forced into retirement, he chose, like other cut throats, movie stars and estates agents, to settle in southern California, presumably free from retribution. But in 1980 his surviving victims hit the Butcher with a law suit under America's Alien Claims Torts Act.

      "body": "<p>The terrible fate of the 58 Chinese migrants found dead in a container lorry in Dover ought, among other things, to draw attention to a serious flaw in the economic model that has recently conquered most of the world. </p> <p>In theory 'market economics' rule. In practice it is a specialised version of market economics that has triumphed. What we have is a general acceptance that governments can do nothing about the free movement of capital, except compete with one another in order to attract it; on the other hand, for all the obeisance paid to 'freeing up' product and labour markets, the movement of labour is very tightly controlled. </p> <p>There has been much controversy about this Government's tough line on asylum seekers, but it is not my purpose this week to enter that particular fray. What is truly remarkable is that it has been so widely accepted that the immigration of 'genuine' asylum seekers is the only immigration that an advanced industrial economy can contemplate. </p> <p>It is well known that the mighty US economy was founded on immigration and, as my colleague Faisal Islam pointed out recently, the information revolution led by the US economy has been heavily dependent on immigrant skilled workers, while a stream of lower skilled immigrants has helped to keep US inflationary pressures at bay. </p> <p>The present British labour force is descended, if you look back a couple of thousand years, from a stream of immigrants from Rome, Scandinavia (the Vikings), Saxony, Normandy, France and the low countries (the Huguenots), large areas of Europe (from which came both Jewish and non-Jewish immigrants) and the West Indies. Oh, and I nearly forgot (and with a name like mine!) - Ireland. </p> <p>Many immigrants were fleeing from persecution; some of those earlier ones were even conquerors; others came to seek a better life. Indeed, western history and literature are abundant in stories which boil down to the migration associated with the search for a chance for people to 'improve their economic circumstances'. This motive was a major factor behind the eventual fall of the Berlin Wall. People were just fleeing from eastern Germany, and found a route out. </p> <p>One of the key factors behind the generous terms on which the monetary unification of east and west Germany took place was the desire to prevent wholesale migration to the West. </p> <p>That was a special case. Most people choose not to leave their home surroundings - unless they are desperate or unusually adventurous. The Chinese migrants found dead on arrival in Dover were desperate. </p> <p>Yes, freedom of choice is supposed to be one of the fundamentals of the modern market economy; but the freedom to choose where you work in the 'globalised' economy is severely constrained. </p> <p>We seem to have moved from one extreme to another: in the Fifties the UK actively encouraged immigration for economic reasons; now it actively discourages it - with the exception of the NHS, again. Thus market pressures are perforating the shield: in theory the European Union is a kind of 'fortress Europe' in which EU nationals can work anywhere, but which is largely barred to outsiders; in practice the German government has decided it needs tens of thousands of immigrant workers with expertise in information technology. </p> <p>What would help the immigration debate, apart from a sense of humanity, is a sense of proportion. The 'need' for immigrant workers can be exaggerated: the argument that we need lots of immigrant workers to pay for our pensions does not take enough note of the way the British labour market has been distorted by the fashion for unnecessarily early and often involuntary retirement. </p> <p>The most libertarian of observers can see that Britain is a relatively overcrowded island, and that there has to be a happy medium between the present Draconian limits and a world of unrestricted immigration. Indeed, a common sense approach to the dangers of overcrowding in particular areas of the country lay behind what we used to call 'regional policy' - a concept that shows welcome signs of revival after years of neglect. </p> <p>For although capital, in the shape of portfolio or direct investment, can flow almost anywhere under 'globalisation', much of the infrastructure of social capital is by definition fixed. It usually makes more sense to take work to the people of a depressed city or region than to let it erode, and add to overcrowding elsewhere. </p> <p>In these matters, the 'market' takes an unconscionably long time to work. I have seen it reported that California was considered a 'paradise' in the Fifties, when it had 10 million people, but that the prospect of 50 million is another matter, and there is now a lot of emigration from paradise. </p> <p>Whatever happens to immigration policy vis \u00e0 vis applications to enter Europe, the economic rules of the single currency imply that intra-EU migration will increase, if only as an economic adjustment mechanism, just as inter-state migration has always been a strong feature of the US economy. </p> <p>It is worth noting that a feature of the current Irish boom has been to encourage immigration - an interesting reversal of previous patterns.</p>",

What we have is a general acceptance that governments can do nothing about the free movement of capital, except compete with one another in order to attract it; on the other hand, for all the obeisance paid to 'freeing up' product and labour markets, the movement of labour is very tightly controlled. There has been much controversy about this Government's tough line on asylum seekers, but it is not my purpose this week to enter that particular fray. What is truly remarkable is that it has been so widely accepted that the immigration of 'genuine' asylum seekers is the only immigration that an advanced industrial economy can contemplate. It is well known that the mighty US economy was founded on immigration and, as my colleague Faisal Islam pointed out recently, the information revolution led by the US economy has been heavily dependent on immigrant skilled workers, while a stream of lower skilled immigrants has helped to keep US inflationary pressures at bay. The present British labour force is descended, if you look back a couple of thousand years, from a stream of immigrants from Rome, Scandinavia (the Vikings), Saxony, Normandy, France and the low countries (the Huguenots), large areas of Europe (from which came both Jewish and non-Jewish immigrants) and the West Indies. Oh, and I nearly forgot (and with a name like mine!) - Ireland. Many immigrants were fleeing from persecution; some of those earlier ones were even conquerors; others came to seek a better life. Indeed, western history and literature are abundant in stories which boil down to the migration associated with the search for a chance for people to 'improve their economic circumstances'. This motive was a major factor behind the eventual fall of the Berlin Wall. People were just fleeing from eastern Germany, and found a route out. One of the key factors behind the generous terms on which the monetary unification of east and west Germany took place was the desire to prevent wholesale migration to the West. That was a special case. Most people choose not to leave their home surroundings - unless they are desperate or unusually adventurous. The Chinese migrants found dead on arrival in Dover were desperate. Yes, freedom of choice is supposed to be one of the fundamentals of the modern market economy; but the freedom to choose where you work in the 'globalised' economy is severely constrained. We seem to have moved from one extreme to another: in the Fifties the UK actively encouraged immigration for economic reasons; now it actively discourages it - with the exception of the NHS, again. Thus market pressures are perforating the shield: in theory the European Union is a kind of 'fortress Europe' in which EU nationals can work anywhere, but which is largely barred to outsiders; in practice the German government has decided it needs tens of thousands of immigrant workers with expertise in information technology. What would help the immigration debate, apart from a sense of humanity, is a sense of proportion. The 'need' for immigrant workers can be exaggerated: the argument that we need lots of immigrant workers to pay for our pensions does not take enough note of the way the British labour market has been distorted by the fashion for unnecessarily early and often involuntary retirement. The most libertarian of observers can see that Britain is a relatively overcrowded island, and that there has to be a happy medium between the present Draconian limits and a world of unrestricted immigration. Indeed, a common sense approach to the dangers of overcrowding in particular areas of the country lay behind what we used to call 'regional policy' - a concept that shows welcome signs of revival after years of neglect. For although capital, in the shape of portfolio or direct investment, can flow almost anywhere under 'globalisation', much of the infrastructure of social capital is by definition fixed. It usually makes more sense to take work to the people of a depressed city or region than to let it erode, and add to overcrowding elsewhere. In these matters, the 'market' takes an unconscionably long time to work. I have seen it reported that California was considered a 'paradise' in the Fifties, when it had 10 million people, but that the prospect of 50 million is another matter, and there is now a lot of emigration from paradise. Whatever happens to immigration policy vis \u00e0 vis applications to enter Europe, the economic rules of the single currency imply that intra-EU migration will increase, if only as an economic adjustment mechanism, just as inter-state migration has always been a strong feature of the US economy. It is worth noting that a feature of the current Irish boom has been to encourage immigration - an interesting reversal of previous patterns.",

      "body": "<p>Chris Murray will never forget the moment his company was banished to the wilderness. As managing director of Nuclear Waste Management Company Nirex, he was at company headquarters in Harwell when, at 11.20am on March 17 1997, his boss broke the shocking news to him. </p> <p>The Conservative Environment Secretary, John Gummer, had turned down plans to build a test site for a deep underground store at Sellafield in Cumbria. </p> <p>Until then Nirex had been at the very centre of Britain's nuclear industrial strategy. </p> <p>Murray says: ' It was devastating. It was the first time that the nuclear industry had lost a planning inquiry. And it resulted in a total loss of confidence in Nirex as a company.' </p> <p>Nirex did not die - it's knowledge base was too valuable for that - but its influence in industry, in policy, in Whitehall and Westminster ended. It became an undead company. </p> <p>The cautionary tale of Nirex shows what happens when science overtakes government and public opinion, and when political and company objectives become entangled. It is a story which ministers - scarred from the GM foods, BSE and British Nuclear Fuels controversies,- recognise only too well. </p> <p>Now, three years later, Nirex may return from the twilight zone. The question is, how quickly and in what form? </p> <p>Environment Minister Michael Meacher is planning a consultation on how to re-open the issue: it was due early this year - but delayed, with rumours it may be pushed back to the autumn. </p> <p>The Government and Nirex have to first win back public confidence. Next it is vital to convince politicians of the urgent need for new policy. The half-lives of some of the radioactive materials involved are one million years (see sidebar, below right). What is a month here and there, they - and you -may ask? </p> <p>Charles Curtis, chairman of the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee, established by the government in 1978, believes a decision is vital soon. </p> <p>'It is in the interest of the public and of public finances to put in place permanent arrangements. There is a great deal of waste which is being dealt with in a temporary and costly manner.' </p> <p>And, as a House of Lords Science and Technology Committee report pointed out last year: 'The long time-scale might be thought to be a reason for postponing decisions. But the contrary is the case, since existing storage arrangements have a limited life and will require replacement.' </p> <p>The Lords also pointed out the flaws in the 'fragmentation' of nuclear waste policy: disposal is messy and dangerous, and the categorisation is complicated. </p> <p>In April 1994 the UK's inventory showed a total of 71,000 cubic metres of waste - in addition to plutonium and uranium stocks, currently not classed as waste. </p> <p>This is divided into three categories. High-level waste (HLW), which needs active cooling for 50 years before it can be disposed of, makes up 2.3 per cent of the volume but 90 per cent of the total radioactivity. Intermediate- level waste (ILW) makes up 86.6 per cent of the inventory, and contains most of the remaining radioactivity. Low- level waste (LLW) is 11.1 per cent in volume. </p> <p>These wastes are stored at or near British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield site and at the UK Atomic Energy Authority's Dounreay site in Scotland. </p> <p>Fragmentation of waste reflects the haphazard evolution of policy and of the institutions designed to deal with it. The problem was not really addressed until 1976, with a report by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. In 1982 Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Management Executive was created. It was renamed Nirex in 1985 and placed on a commercial footing. </p> <p>Nirex's remit increased the fragmentation - it was given responsibility only for ILW and some LLW. </p> <p>Nirex faced a series of further problems, regarding disposal sites. Two alternatives were chosen - a near-surface store for shorter-lived LLW and ILW, and a deep site in a disused ICI mine for longer- term ILW. ICI faced local opposition and withdrew its offer. </p> <p>Nirex was then told in 1984 to explore three sites for a near-surface store, and three for a deep one. In 1987 the Government scrapped plans for a near-surface site. In 1992 Nirex revealed plans for an underground laboratory, called a rock characterisation facility, or RCF, to test geology for a deep repository at Sellafield in Cumbria. There was a storm of protest from residents and environmental campaigners. In 1997 a Government Inspector turned down the application. He stated that the choice of Sellafield for the RCF had not been made objectively, that it was premature, and that more needed to be known about the geology of the site. </p> <p>In short, a decision which had been taken behind closed doors by scientists blew up in their face. </p> <p>Nirex has taken the intervening three years to come to terms with this decision. </p> <p>Key to the problem was Nirex's public awareness. Murray says the only people who thought the issue at hand was a test laboratory were Nirex. The rest of the world saw it as a Trojan horse for a waste dump. </p> <p>Following the planning refusal, the company cut staff from 230 to 67, slashed its spending from \u00a350 million a year to \u00a311m and became little more than a think-tank on waste disposal issues. It continues to approve packaging processes, carried out by BNFL and UKAEA. </p> <p>Nirex was hammered from all sides. Its shareholders, BNFL, UKAEA, British Energy and the Government, complained that \u00a3500m had been wasted. </p> <p>The public, media and academics all dug in. Murray says: 'Many were delighted that an institution like Nirex had been turned over. Some thought we deserved it.' </p> <p>It is tempting to ask Murray and his advisers whether they did anything right. </p> <p>Nirex admits Nirex was part of the problem, that there was a lack of openness in the decision-making, that it was rushed and, that there was no clear 'road map' outlining key destinations. </p> <p>One problem which goes to the heart of Nirex's difficulties was 'retrievability'. On the one hand, there was concern that burying waste in a deep store and backfilling it forever meant a decision on where to site a store could never be reversed. So the community there would be living on top of a 'dump'. </p> <p>But on the other hand, allowing retrievability - at least for the three to four hundred years it would take to settle the current inventory - meant human error or terrorism entered the equation. </p> <p>This is one of the key issues the government will have to deal with once the consulta tion takes place. Murray, sensitive to public pressure, is now calling for a complete revision of all storage options - including formerly discounted ones such as sea-bed disposal and space disposal. </p> <p>He is also calling for more public awareness in the decision-making process. The composition of Nirex itself will be a key part of the Government's plans. </p> <p>Should Nirex be given responsibility for all nuclear waste? Should it be owned by BNFL, UKAEA and British Energy, all of whom produce waste, and have vested interests in its disposal? What form should Nirex take to carry the waste responsibility into the future, and how will it maintain records over that time? </p> <p>Murray is not prepared to comment prematurely. He, like Meacher, the Environment Minister, cannot afford to get it wrong again. </p> <p><strong>The 4,500 million-year question</strong><br> Radioactivity is caused by the instability of nuclei in atoms. The nucleus of an atom contains neutrons and protons which, added together, give an atomic number. </p> <p>A single element - such as carbon, uranium or plutonium - may have several variants, each with different atomic numbers. These are formed as atoms with unstable nuclei, called radionuclides, created in nuclear reactions. </p> <p>They attempt to make themselves more stable, changing their atomic make-up by throwing out nuclear matter, and altering the number. This causes radiation. Eventually they become stable, but the timescales vary dramatically. </p> <p>The benchmark for radioactivity is a radionuclide's 'half-life' - the time it takes for half the atoms in a sample to become stable. Some 95 per cent of radionuclides have half-lives of 100 years or less. For example Nickel-63 has a 96- year half-life. Caesium-137 takes 30 years. But there are some which take much longer. </p> <p>Plutonium-239 - which contributes about 0.8 per cent of radioactivity in the UK inventory - has a 24,000 year half-life. Chlorine-36 contributes 0.0007 per cent and has 301,000 years, while Iodine-129 gives 0.0001 per cent and has 15.7 million years. Uranium-238 with 0.0022 per cent has a 4,500 million-year half-life. </p> <p>They will also inevitably leak into the environment. This is because however safe a store is made, water will seep through, carrying traces of the substances through rock and out into the 'biosphere'. </p> <p>Nirex calculates that this will happen with chlorine-26 and iodine-129 in 100,000 years and with uranium-238 in a million years. Nirex claims the amounts will be very small and not harmful to those living nearby.</p> <p><strong>Ways of dealing with waste<br> Geological disposal: </strong> Mined tunnels and chambers at least 300 metres deep, with even deeper boreholes to contain waste.

      "body": "<p>The appearance of Charles Kennedy on Question Time last week was on the whole impressive. He started uncertainly, parrying questions on economic migrants and scanning the audience like some night-club owner on the lookout for troublemakers.</p> <p>Gone is the easy manner of the old Kennedy, broadcaster, bon viveur and wit. Now we have the homme s\u00e9rieux, husky voiced and earnest.</p> <p>He dealt skilfully with the planted Tory europhobes who want to pin their party's destiny to the pound, but I was struck by the fact that when he turned to the West Lothian question he managed to advance his party's solution - federalism across the UK - without once mentioning the f-word, which has been used so freely by the Tory press in its demonisation of all things European, even though, as Kennedy pointed out, it means less rather than more centralism.</p> <p>In the old debates about devolution, those who argued that it would not lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom used to make two assumptions. The first was that Westminster would not punish and isolate Scotland by cutting public expenditure north of the border; the second was that both the Tory and Labour parties would continue to be committed to the United Kingdom as our dominant constitutional entity.</p> <p>Both propositions still largely hold true but are fraying at the edges. Last week Lord Barnett himself renounced the formula for sharing out public expenditure named after him. In the English regions a head of steam is building up to remove some of Scotland's cash and give it to places like the North East which appear to have fared badly by comparison.</p> <p>John Prescott skilfully evaded the point when questioned about it on Radio 4's Today, preferring to emphasise the work of the relatively new English regional development agencies. But he did indicate that he thought the correct response to any disparity was to level up rather than down. In any case, the Barnett Formula should over the coming years shave off some of Scotland's relative advantage.</p> <p>But on the Tory side there seems to be less sagacity and statecraft, on this and other questions. What was not foreseen in the Seventies was how the party would change through the Thatcher era. Its support in Scotland was heavily eroded. The European question, and the eclipse of the party's Europhile wing, has hastened its mutation into an English National Party. Old-fashioned one-nation Conservatives are in a distinct minority. The Scottish Tories are struggling, with some difficulty, to find a place in this new world, wrapping themselves in the Saltire rather than the Union Jack.</p> <p>But one feature of the new landscape in England is a tone of virulent resentment and dislike of Scotland and its perceived constitutional and fiscal advantages.

      "bodyText": "The appearance of Charles Kennedy on Question Time last week was on the whole impressive. He started uncertainly, parrying questions on economic migrants and scanning the audience like some night-club owner on the lookout for troublemakers. Gone is the easy manner of the old Kennedy, broadcaster, bon viveur and wit. Now we have the homme s\u00e9rieux, husky voiced and earnest. He dealt skilfully with the planted Tory europhobes who want to pin their party's destiny to the pound, but I was struck by the fact that when he turned to the West Lothian question he managed to advance his party's solution - federalism across the UK - without once mentioning the f-word, which has been used so freely by the Tory press in its demonisation of all things European, even though, as Kennedy pointed out, it means less rather than more centralism. In the old debates about devolution, those who argued that it would not lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom used to make two assumptions. The first was that Westminster would not punish and isolate Scotland by cutting public expenditure north of the border; the second was that both the Tory and Labour parties would continue to be committed to the United Kingdom as our dominant constitutional entity. Both propositions still largely hold true but are fraying at the edges. Last week Lord Barnett himself renounced the formula for sharing out public expenditure named after him. In the English regions a head of steam is building up to remove some of Scotland's cash and give it to places like the North East which appear to have fared badly by comparison. John Prescott skilfully evaded the point when questioned about it on Radio 4's Today, preferring to emphasise the work of the relatively new English regional development agencies. But he did indicate that he thought the correct response to any disparity was to level up rather than down. In any case, the Barnett Formula should over the coming years shave off some of Scotland's relative advantage. But on the Tory side there seems to be less sagacity and statecraft, on this and other questions. What was not foreseen in the Seventies was how the party would change through the Thatcher era. Its support in Scotland was heavily eroded. The European question, and the eclipse of the party's Europhile wing, has hastened its mutation into an English National Party. Old-fashioned one-nation Conservatives are in a distinct minority. The Scottish Tories are struggling, with some difficulty, to find a place in this new world, wrapping themselves in the Saltire rather than the Union Jack. But one feature of the new landscape in England is a tone of virulent resentment and dislike of Scotland and its perceived constitutional and fiscal advantages. These voices are still fairly subdued but they are increasingly making themselves heard, not just among Tories from the shires but among policy-makers and intellectuals. What was certainly not foreseen was that the West Lothian question would first raise its head in the coming Commons debate on fox-hunting. Tam Dalyell is denying himself a vote but few other Scottish MPs are following his example. As Kennedy told his audience, they have no obligation to remain silent on any issue that comes before the UK parliament to which they were elected even though the outcome affects only England. After all, Scotland lived through a long period under Thatcher when the reverse was true, the period in which poll tax was first tried on the dog and when Scottish committees at Westminster were packed with English Tories. What Kennedy could have added, but circumspectly did not, is that until they embrace federalism - with an elected Senate and even an elected president - the English should really shut up about the West Lothian question.

      "body": "<p>An astrologer who for years advised Francois Mitterrand on affairs of state yesterday released tape recordings of conversations with the late French president, revealing that he asked her advice on issues as varied as the Gulf War and power struggles in the Kremlin.</p> <p>Elisabeth Teissier, a best-selling writer and the author of several hugely popular 'you and your stars' columns in the French press, said she had released the tapes, published in the first issue of a new monthly magazine, Le Vrai Papier Journal , to refute suggestions that her relationship with Mitterrand - whose wife used to call him 'the great seducer' - was not solely professional.</p> <p>Teissier, a former model and actress whom Mitterrand described as 'resembling Ava Gardner', first revealed her contribution to the late president's decision-making processes three years ago, claiming she was Mitterrand's confidante over the course of several years.</p> <p>She said that between 1989 and 1994, the year before he left office, the president used to call her from the Elys\u00e9e Palace before taking virtually any important decision. She said Mitterrand gave his approval for the conversations to be recorded from 1991 onwards, knowing that one day they would be made public.</p> <p>In one conversation, on 9 January 1991, days before a crucial meeting between US secretary of state James Baker and Iraqi foreign minister Tariq Aziz in a last-gasp bid to avert the Gulf War, Teissier called Mitterrand herself to tell 'my dear, my eminent scorpion' that the stars were 'ultra-favourable' for the period around the 10th of the month.</p> <p>'That's interesting, because at the moment Tariq Aziz is still talking,' Mitterrand replies. 'That's quite a good sign, because it wouldn't usually go on that long... They've been at it for four hours now.'</p> <p>In another conversation, on 23 January, Teissier tells the president to avoid 'everything to do with the sea'. When Mitterrand asks if he risks 'a shipwreck in the Atlantic', the astrologer reassures him, and informs him that in March he would be likely to have 'a very important role indeed in the negotiations to end the war that will be taking place then'.</p> <p>On 1 February, Mitterrand - who died of cancer in 1996, less than a year after leaving office - tells his soothsayer that he is soon going to have to make a speech about the progress of the war. 'You once told me there were days when it was better to talk, and days when it was better not to talk. When is the next best day for me to speak? Could you check for me?' he asks her. 'Sunday, Monday or Tuesday,' comes the reply.</p> <p>Much later, in June, Teissier tells the president 'on no account to drive on the 7th of the month', while on 20 August she informs him bluntly: 'From tomorrow, I'm very much afraid that Yeltsin risks being ousted.' Mitterrand, concerned, replies: 'Oh really? Do keep me abreast of all that...'</p> <p>Mitterrand's illegitimate daughter, Mazarine Pingeot, who has made a point of speaking out on every possible occasion to defend her father's crumbling reputation, insisted her father always took his decisions independently of Teissier's advice.</p>",

Elisabeth Teissier, a best-selling writer and the author of several hugely popular 'you and your stars' columns in the French press, said she had released the tapes, published in the first issue of a new monthly magazine, Le Vrai Papier Journal , to refute suggestions that her relationship with Mitterrand - whose wife used to call him 'the great seducer' - was not solely professional. Teissier, a former model and actress whom Mitterrand described as 'resembling Ava Gardner', first revealed her contribution to the late president's decision-making processes three years ago, claiming she was Mitterrand's confidante over the course of several years. She said that between 1989 and 1994, the year before he left office, the president used to call her from the Elys\u00e9e Palace before taking virtually any important decision. She said Mitterrand gave his approval for the conversations to be recorded from 1991 onwards, knowing that one day they would be made public. In one conversation, on 9 January 1991, days before a crucial meeting between US secretary of state James Baker and Iraqi foreign minister Tariq Aziz in a last-gasp bid to avert the Gulf War, Teissier called Mitterrand herself to tell 'my dear, my eminent scorpion' that the stars were 'ultra-favourable' for the period around the 10th of the month. 'That's interesting, because at the moment Tariq Aziz is still talking,' Mitterrand replies. 'That's quite a good sign, because it wouldn't usually go on that long... They've been at it for four hours now.' In another conversation, on 23 January, Teissier tells the president to avoid 'everything to do with the sea'. When Mitterrand asks if he risks 'a shipwreck in the Atlantic', the astrologer reassures him, and informs him that in March he would be likely to have 'a very important role indeed in the negotiations to end the war that will be taking place then'. On 1 February, Mitterrand - who died of cancer in 1996, less than a year after leaving office - tells his soothsayer that he is soon going to have to make a speech about the progress of the war. 'You once told me there were days when it was better to talk, and days when it was better not to talk. When is the next best day for me to speak? Could you check for me?' he asks her. 'Sunday, Monday or Tuesday,' comes the reply. Much later, in June, Teissier tells the president 'on no account to drive on the 7th of the month', while on 20 August she informs him bluntly: 'From tomorrow, I'm very much afraid that Yeltsin risks being ousted.' Mitterrand, concerned, replies: 'Oh really? Do keep me abreast of all that...' Mitterrand's illegitimate daughter, Mazarine Pingeot, who has made a point of speaking out on every possible occasion to defend her father's crumbling reputation, insisted her father always took his decisions independently of Teissier's advice.",

      "body": "<p>In Compton Mackenzie's Whisky Galore, Hebrideans conspired to defeat the Exciseman. But now the island of Islay faces an even more formidable opponent.</p> <p>Soon, because of EU law, the island will be criss-crossed by road tankers dumping waste water from the distilleries. But The Observer can reveal that a new study shows the waste water may in fact benefit the environment.</p> <p>The EU developed the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive because the Mediterranean was turning to sludge. But it applies to the whole community.</p> <p>Islay's distilleries make more alcohol per capita than anywhere else in the world. Not just any alcohol, but celebrated peaty malts like Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Ardbeg and Bowmore.</p> <p>'We dry the barley in peat smoke. That's what gives the whisky its distinctive flavour,' says Andy Cant of the island's malting house. When whisky is distilled, it leaves behind a liquid of yeast and cereal known as pot ale. Traditionally this is pumped straight into the sea but the EU Directive insists that any industrial waste water pumped into the sea must meet certain standards.</p> <p>The pot ale does not meet the EU criteria because the alchemy of whisky production occurs in copper stills and traces of the metal get into the water. The new law says pot ale must either be treated or pumped into fast-flowing currents to prevent concentrations building up.</p> <p>Laphroaig's outfall pipe is long enough already but Lagavulin distillery along with three others have had to come up with a different solution. From next January their pot ale will be taken by tanker across the island to pipes on the sound of Islay, where the tidal race is so fast the sea moves like a river.</p> <p>'People don't fully realise what its going to be like,' says Brian Palmer of the local newspaper, the Ileach. There will be 50 journeys a week by the tankers. The traffic will be constant as two eight-hour shifts a day work to get the pot ale to the new facility. 'The EU law is aimed at the environment, but what about the noise and pollution of all that traffic' says Mr. Palmer.</p> <p>The distilleries say they considered alternatives but road tankers were the only economically viable solution. 'It's ridiculous we are having to do this in the first place' says Brian Cant, of United Distillers and Vintners.</p> <p>That sense of farce is set to grow as The Observer has learnt that new scientific evidence shows distillery waste can help the environment.</p> <p>Ian Lambert, United Distillers environmental officer, says the findings of an independent study to be published this year show that naturally occurring chemicals in the peaty soil neutralise the effects of the copper. 'It even suggests that the discharged water is good for the environment,' he says.</p> <p>What concerns islanders is that this once tranquil spot will soon be ruined by the noise and pollution of the tankers. They worry that the same peat which gives the whisky its taste does not make a good surface to build roads on. Locals fear that tankers will literally crush them into the bog.</p> <p>The distillery owners say they are aware of the concerns about road maintenance. They say they have paid their local taxes for many years, and are responsible for the huge income to the treasury from whisky duty, and see no reason to pay extra for using the roads.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In Compton Mackenzie's Whisky Galore, Hebrideans conspired to defeat the Exciseman. But now the island of Islay faces an even more formidable opponent. Soon, because of EU law, the island will be criss-crossed by road tankers dumping waste water from the distilleries. But The Observer can reveal that a new study shows the waste water may in fact benefit the environment. The EU developed the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive because the Mediterranean was turning to sludge. But it applies to the whole community. Islay's distilleries make more alcohol per capita than anywhere else in the world. Not just any alcohol, but celebrated peaty malts like Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Ardbeg and Bowmore. 'We dry the barley in peat smoke. That's what gives the whisky its distinctive flavour,' says Andy Cant of the island's malting house. When whisky is distilled, it leaves behind a liquid of yeast and cereal known as pot ale. Traditionally this is pumped straight into the sea but the EU Directive insists that any industrial waste water pumped into the sea must meet certain standards. The pot ale does not meet the EU criteria because the alchemy of whisky production occurs in copper stills and traces of the metal get into the water. The new law says pot ale must either be treated or pumped into fast-flowing currents to prevent concentrations building up. Laphroaig's outfall pipe is long enough already but Lagavulin distillery along with three others have had to come up with a different solution. From next January their pot ale will be taken by tanker across the island to pipes on the sound of Islay, where the tidal race is so fast the sea moves like a river. 'People don't fully realise what its going to be like,' says Brian Palmer of the local newspaper, the Ileach. There will be 50 journeys a week by the tankers. The traffic will be constant as two eight-hour shifts a day work to get the pot ale to the new facility. 'The EU law is aimed at the environment, but what about the noise and pollution of all that traffic' says Mr. Palmer. The distilleries say they considered alternatives but road tankers were the only economically viable solution. 'It's ridiculous we are having to do this in the first place' says Brian Cant, of United Distillers and Vintners. That sense of farce is set to grow as The Observer has learnt that new scientific evidence shows distillery waste can help the environment. Ian Lambert, United Distillers environmental officer, says the findings of an independent study to be published this year show that naturally occurring chemicals in the peaty soil neutralise the effects of the copper. 'It even suggests that the discharged water is good for the environment,' he says. What concerns islanders is that this once tranquil spot will soon be ruined by the noise and pollution of the tankers. They worry that the same peat which gives the whisky its taste does not make a good surface to build roads on. Locals fear that tankers will literally crush them into the bog. The distillery owners say they are aware of the concerns about road maintenance. They say they have paid their local taxes for many years, and are responsible for the huge income to the treasury from whisky duty, and see no reason to pay extra for using the roads.",

They just had a good idea, and are prepared to put in the hours to make it work. 'France is surfing on the internet information technology wave, and I don't think it's a passing phase,' said Joel Courtois, Epita's director.

For not only does Gary Graham's death leave the marks of a physical struggle in the death chamber, but a trail of unheard evidence, untried tests and uncertainty at the core of his case. No sooner had Graham's body slumped lifeless than another death penalty controversy was breaking - this time not over the head of Governor Bush, but President Clinton and his appointed dauphin, Bush's presidential election rival, Al Gore. A condemned migrant agricultural worker, Juan Raul Garza, is due to be executed in Texas on 5 August - not at the order of the Texas state court but of the federal court system. His will be the first federal execution since John Kennedy was President. And there is a hitch which cuts to the core of another nightmare surrounding the death penalty apart from that of innocence - race. Garza's lawyers have challenged the President - with the powerful support of the American Bar Association - to call a moratorium on all 21 pending federal executions. And as part of the challenge is an application for the release of a government study into how far race is a factor in applying the death penalty. The Justice Department has so far turned down the application for Garza's lawyers to analyse the data on which the report is based, with a spokesman saying that the study has not yet been completed. But Gregory Wierchioch, representing Garza, say he knows that the study has examined at least 12 cases similar to Garza's - involving drug-related murders - in which the federal government did not seek the death penalty. Wiercioch says that, of the 27 people condemned by the administration of Bush's father for drug-related killings, 23 are black or Hispanic - and he wants to know why. A former member of a Justice Department review committee, Rory Little, wrote in the Fordham Law Journal recently that between 1994 and 1999 one-third of US attorneys' offices did not file capital punishment requests in similar cases. Garza's lawyers believe that the data reveals the motive to be racial. The potential Garza crisis for the White House is detonated by the fact that Texas was forced only two weeks ago to suspend nine executions pending investigations into alleged racial bias. A special review panel had found that, in every case, race had been cited by the prosecution psychiatrist as a reason the defendant constituted a future threat - a pre-requisite for a death sentence in Texas. The coming federal execution row will turn the spotlight from Bush towards his rival, Gore - whose silence over the Graham execution has been deafening. Vice-President Gore is an equally ardent supporter of the death penalty, but was last week forced to admit, with respect to the Justice Department study, that 'the question of racial disparity is right now being investigated thoroughly'. The intervention of the American Bar Association is a crucial and novel ingredient, indicative of swelling public impatience with the death penalty. In a letter to President Clinton last month calling for a federal moratorium, the association's president, William Paul, went expressly beyond the race issue, urging 'a comprehensive examination of the federal death penalty that would not be limited to the question of racial discrimination'.

The delegation had been shouting slogans, proclaiming 'Palestine is Arab'. Vatican criticises China The Vatican denounced plans by China to ordain new bishops for its state Catholic Church, saying such a move would place new obstacles in the path of closer relations between Rome and Beijing. Fiji hopes dashed Hopes for an end to Fiji's hostage crisis were dashed after plans by the military and rebels to sign a deal for the release of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and 30 other hostages collapsed. Ferry captain arrested Chinese authorities have arrested the captain and the owner of an overloaded ferry that capsized in the Yangtze river, leaving more than 100 people feared dead. Dolphin inseminated Scientists at Hong Kong Polytechnic University have for the first time artificially inseminated a dolphin, by accurately predicting ovulation using ultrasound. Cemetery attacked Five German youths suspected of overturning or damaging 35 gravestones in the Jewish cemetery in the western German town of Worms, once a major Jewish centre, were being questioned by police. Landslides kill 10 Landslides triggered by torrential monsoon rains Saturday left at least 10 people dead in the port city of Chittagong, Bangladesh. Motorway blockade Environmental activists ended their blockade of a key Alpine motorway - the Brenner motorway, which links Austria with Germany and Italy - but threatened further protests against lorry traffic choking the mountains unless their demands were met. Local people have been incensed by a 50 per cent increase in traffic since 1993.

      "bodyText": "Richard Ingrams (Diary, last week) clearly has some issues with his own masculinity. Not content with his regular homophobic rants, he now suggests that Tony Blair's decision to take time off to bond with his new offspring left him 'looking far from manly'. Since when was a participatory and involved approach to fatherhood incompatible with 'being a man'? Given the growing alienation of female voters from the macho posturing which passes for policy under New Labour, reported elsewhere in your paper ('Women Wave Bye-Bye to Tony'), many would welcome more, rather than less, displays of sensitivity and domesticity from our political masters. If Blair is to be criticised, it is not for his demonstrations of public affection, but for his failure to take the opportunity to establish both maternity and paternity leave as a recognised and valued part of every individual's working life. The persistence of a masculine culture which continues to undervalue the domestic and co-operative in favour of the public and the competitive makes a nonsense of New Labour's claims of social modernisation and Ingrams's absurd panics over the 'feminisation' of society.

Democratic congressman Tom Lantos has lobbied for the minimum working age to be universalised. 'Farms are now agro-businesses, far distant from their 1930s equivalents,' he told The Observer . 'We need greater funding so that the laws will be enforced.' Lantos also wants new pesticide safety limits for children: the present exposure limits are set for a man of 154lb in weight. But as Juan returns tonight to the viaduct beneath which he sleeps, the distinction between man and boy has never been so slight.",

      "bodyText": "The battle over who controls the world's food supplies has escalated dramatically with the Indian government launching a legal challenge in the United States against an American company which has been granted a patent on the world-renowned basmati rice. It is thought to be the first time a government in a developing country has challenged an attempt by a US company to patent - and thus control the production of - staple food and crops in what campaigners dub the 'rush for green gold'. Basmati rice, sought-after for its fragrant taste, was developed by Indian farmers over hundreds of years, but the Texan company RiceTec obtained a patent for a cross-breed with American long-grain rice. RiceTec was granted the patent on the basis of aroma, elongation of the grain on cooking and chalkiness. However, the Indian government last week filed 50,000 pages of scientific evidence to the US Patents and Trademarks Office, insisting that most high quality basmati varieties already possess these characteristics. The US Patent and Trademarks office accepted the petition and will re-examine its legitimacy. The patent - granted only in the US - gives RiceTec control over basmati rice production in North America. Farmers have to pay a fee to grow the rice and are not allowed to plant the seeds to grow the following year's crops. India fears the patent will severely damage exports from its own farmers to the US. In 1998, they exported almost 600,000 tonnes of basmati rice. India has also objected to RiceTec calling the rice 'basmati', insisting the name should be used only for rice grown in the Basmati region of India. The Indian government is claiming similar status for basmati rice as that granted to Champagne, Cognac and Scotch whisky. India's legal challenge is being support by ActionAid, which is launching a campaign to highlight the issue next week. Ruchi Tripathi said: 'The basmati patent exposes the mounting threat posed by multinationals to crops devel oped and grown by poor farmers for generations.' There are currently more than 200 patents granted on rice, almost exclusively to US and Japanese companies. It is currently not possible to patent staple foods and crops in Europe or developing countries but a European directive is about to change that in the EU. At World Trade Organisation talks which start tomorrow, rich nations are expected to put pressure on developing nations to allow the patenting of crops in their own countries. Tripathi said: 'If rich countries abuse their power to get their way in the World Trade Organisation, developing countries like India will lose the right to challenge patents on crops.'",

Until El Zorro (The Fox) - aka Vicente Fox Quesada - came to town. He is offering Mexicans the first real election next Sunday since their revolution against Spain. Nogales is now very Mexican indeed, the main street festooned with rival banners, voting registration on every corner, posters and a feeling of change in the air. For months, Mexico's presidential race - probably the most important ever fought - seemed headed inexorably towards yet another victory, the 14th in a row, for the nominee chosen by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has ruled since its foundation in 1929. But El Zorro - a former executive with Coca-Cola, 6ft 6in, who wears polished cowboy boots - has blown the contest wide open, challenging the PRI's formidable and corrupt machine and closing the overwhelming lead of Labatista Ochoa, the PRI presidential nominee. Trailing in third place is Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas, the leftist candidate and a former mayor of Mexico City, who has been urged to quit in order to unite the opposition vote and help Quesada win. For him to do so would be a twist of ideological irony, but logical in terms of challenging decades of rotten, corrupt government in Mexico. Quesada, leader of the largest opposition party, National Action, has called the ruling block a 'monster' and bombastically said that what Mexico needs is a 'Lech Walesa or Nelson Mandela', without overtly suggesting himself in the role. His popular appeal is based on his challenging Mexico's lurching and Byzantine system of corrupt patronage operated by the PRI, and on the enthusiasm of Mexico's budding middle and business classes for a complete clean-out of both politics and the petrified Mexican economy. At Coke, Quesada was a marketing strategist. That is how he is running his campaign and that is how he wants to run the country. His constituency is largely in the business-minded north and he is admired on both sides of the high border fence that splits the town of Nogales. His manifesto is one offering to channel loans to small business, to modernise agriculture, to attract foreign investment and to decentralise the moribund bureaucracy. And the demography of Mexico is changing in Quesada's favour. An emergent middle and technocratic class in prosperous industrial centres across the nation is irrevocably altering the political as well as the economic landscape. 'The most critical vote,' says Roy Campos, who heads a polling organisation, 'is the middle class.' So far, the election campaign's most marked quality has been its claim to be the fairest as well as the most competitive ever fought, in terms of media debate and the introduction of an independent agency to arbitrate the electoral college system. But it remains unthinkable that the time-honoured traditions of graft and vote-buying will not mark next Sunday's election. Last week the state governor in Yucat\u00e1n handed out 1,000 washing machines to poor women as part of his re-election drive. In 13 states, welfare recipients and corn farmers have been told outright that they will be cut off from all payments and subsidies if they fail to vote for the PRI. For the United States, the election is also crucial: the affairs of Mexico have become ever more relevant as the border becomes more and more porous - both in terms of immigrants and the endless waves of drugs coming in, and of exports going the other way, along with increasingly strident law enforcement advice for Mexico's supposed war on organised crime. For the US, Quesada's most attractive quality is not the relative modernity of his economic policies but rather the possibility that a political leader might at last end the pretence of a crackdown against the cocaine cartels that operate under the tutelage of the authorities, and enforce drug laws for real. The cross-border crisis that entwines the strands of drugs, crime and the political establishment in Mexico reached another climax in April after federal anti-narcotics investigator Jos\u00e9 Patino Moreno was murdered in the border town of Tijuana. Moreno had watched raid after raid stymied by corrupt government officials, and was even sacked for his overzealous campaign against the Arellano F\u00e9lix brothers, one of the most powerful cross-border crime syndicates. US government and CIA officials attempting to train crime-busting agents see the hand of both the authorities and the syndicate behind Moreno's murder. At the end of last year, there was another grisly reminder of the severity and scale of the drugs war: a mass grave just across the border from El Paso, Texas, of people who had gone missing in cases where, US officials believe, the authorities as well as the drug syndicates played a role. The porous border is itself a political crisis for Mexicans and Americans. All along the Arizona fence, armed civilian vigilantes now join the border guards, patrolling the line with two-way radios, and ready to shoot. 'It is not only a question of pushing them back,' says Campos, 'it is a question of giving people a reason for wanting to stay here'. The idea of a Mexican leader committed to such ideals enthuses people on both sides of the fence that runs through Nogales.",

Georgia's Foreign Minister, Irakli Menagarishvili, flew into New Delhi last month to press his case. He asked his opposite number, Jaswant Singh, to try to locate her remains. The Indians agreed to help.</p> <p>Archaeologists must now unravel one of the last great mysteries of the Portuguese colonial era. While there is no doubt that Queen Ketevan is buried in Goa, near the mummified remains of St Francis Xavier - whose toeless corpse is in the Bom Jesus church down the road from St Augustine's - the archives are vague on detail. They say she was interred 'to the right of the altar' in the St Augustine Church.</p> <p>'The problem is,' said Dr P.P. Shirodkar, who led the last excavation of the church in 1998, 'if you stand facing the altar it becomes the right side. If you stand at the altar, the right side becomes the left side. It is a confusing mystery. There was a practice of burying VIPs in big convents like this, so we are sure she is there somewhere. But so far we have been unable to locate her.'</p> <p>The church, built in 1602 by Augustinian friars, was originally part of a larger monastic complex. The vault and most of the nave collapsed long ago, leaving only a 46-metre bell tower and fa\u00e7ade in the jungle. Excavators in 1988 found 54 grave slabs - but none bore Ketevan's name.</p> <p>Dr V. Rao of Goa's state-run archaeology unit said attempts to find the queen would begin anew after the monsoon. 'The problem is there were four altars, which makes things difficult,' he said. 'Several Georgians have already come to try and find Ketevan, but have left empty-handed.'</p> <p>Queen Ketevan was carried off to Shiraz, now in Iran, when the Persians, led by Shah Abbas the Great, pillaged eastern Georgia. According to a contemporary report by Augustinian fathers, the Shah asked her to convert to Islam and become his wife (she was already a widowed grandmother). When she refused, she was stripped to the waist, tortured with hot irons, crushed with a flaming brazier and strangled.</p> <p>Her body was taken to Lisbon by four Augustinian priests, then to Goa in 1627, as Portugal's Asian empire began to crumble.

      "bodyText": "For almost 400 years, the remains of Queen Ketevan, a Georgian martyr and patriot, lay undisturbed somewhere in St Augustine Church. The challenge for archaeologists is to find her. In an unusual diplomatic move, the Georgians have now said they want their queen back and have asked the Indian government to dig her up. Georgia's Foreign Minister, Irakli Menagarishvili, flew into New Delhi last month to press his case. He asked his opposite number, Jaswant Singh, to try to locate her remains. The Indians agreed to help. Archaeologists must now unravel one of the last great mysteries of the Portuguese colonial era. While there is no doubt that Queen Ketevan is buried in Goa, near the mummified remains of St Francis Xavier - whose toeless corpse is in the Bom Jesus church down the road from St Augustine's - the archives are vague on detail. They say she was interred 'to the right of the altar' in the St Augustine Church. 'The problem is,' said Dr P.P. Shirodkar, who led the last excavation of the church in 1998, 'if you stand facing the altar it becomes the right side. If you stand at the altar, the right side becomes the left side. It is a confusing mystery. There was a practice of burying VIPs in big convents like this, so we are sure she is there somewhere. But so far we have been unable to locate her.' The church, built in 1602 by Augustinian friars, was originally part of a larger monastic complex. The vault and most of the nave collapsed long ago, leaving only a 46-metre bell tower and fa\u00e7ade in the jungle. Excavators in 1988 found 54 grave slabs - but none bore Ketevan's name. Dr V. Rao of Goa's state-run archaeology unit said attempts to find the queen would begin anew after the monsoon. 'The problem is there were four altars, which makes things difficult,' he said. 'Several Georgians have already come to try and find Ketevan, but have left empty-handed.' Queen Ketevan was carried off to Shiraz, now in Iran, when the Persians, led by Shah Abbas the Great, pillaged eastern Georgia. According to a contemporary report by Augustinian fathers, the Shah asked her to convert to Islam and become his wife (she was already a widowed grandmother). When she refused, she was stripped to the waist, tortured with hot irons, crushed with a flaming brazier and strangled. Her body was taken to Lisbon by four Augustinian priests, then to Goa in 1627, as Portugal's Asian empire began to crumble. Although she was Greek Orthodox, Queen Ketevan was subsequently embraced by the Catholic Church as a saint. Her original tomb was said to emit a mysterious light. Merab Chachua, a Georgian government spokesman, said Georgia, which gained independence in 1992, wanted to give Ketevan a full state funeral. 'Queen Ketevan has been declared a saint by the Georgian Church and she is taught in schools. Many Georgian women are called Ketevan. We would like to have her back,' he said.",

      "body": "<p>Filing your tax return through the internet produces the minimal benefit of a \u00a310 refund on your tax bill this year. But there are, in theory at least, other more useful spin-offs. </p> <p>If you give the Inland Revenue your email address, it will keep you updated on any developments and notify you of approaching deadlines. You can find out your tax liability quite quickly rather than waiting weeks to get a reply. And your tax return should also be easier to complete. You are less likely to lose a computer version than a paper one thrown into the back of a drawer. You can also key in the required information as and when you get those P60s, bank statements and other useful documents. </p> <p>That's the good news. The reality is that this electronic system is still a gleam in the eye of Somerset House. An understaffed and under-pressure software team produced a filing system that still, this year, does not quite work. </p> <p>I was one of the first 44,000 taxpayers to register at the Revenue website a couple of weeks ago. But even this was a trial of patience caused by computer glitches. You are told that you need to enter your reference number, your National Insurance number and your postcode. All these details appear on the front page of the paper tax return that was sent out in April. Confusingly, the reference number is marked 'official use' on the tax return - making me for one wonder if I, a mere taxpayer and not an official, should be using it at all. But, yes, you are supposed to use this number. </p> <p>Even more confusing was the fact that my application was three times rejected by the system even though I entered my details correctly. Making use of a box to send an email query to the Rev enue (limit your queries to a maximum of 250 characters, however), I got two bureaucratic replies, restating the requirements, but not addressing my problem. My third query elicited a very sympathetic reply, asking me to ring the helpline instead. When I rang , I discovered that the fault was theirs - and that I would never have discovered this myself. </p> <p>It does not bode well that such basic mistakes have occurred and that the Revenue has done so little to signpost the way round them on its registration website. </p> <p>Faults in the software mean many taxpayers will be precluded from registering if they do everything that is asked of them. A very helpful official on the helpline explained that I would be more likely to get through the registration process if I did not supply my email address or my postcode. In fact, the bare minimum required is to give your reference number and one of either your postcode or your NI number. </p> <p>When I went back, tried again and gave the minimal amount of information, my registration was accepted immediately. It was then a case of waiting 'seven to 10 days' before the Revenue sent me my 'user ID number' through a very slow snail mail indeed. But it did not particularly matter. </p> <p>Like the other 44,000 and anyone else who registers now, I am stuck at this point. You cannot complete your return until you have downloaded the Revenue's free self-assessment software - but (you guessed it) due to 'teething troubles' this is sev eral weeks late in arriving. In theory, it will be ready by the end of June. But, if the Revenue has had such a poor start, there could be more errors in the software when it can be downloaded. </p> <p>The major accountancy firms are not impressed with the Revenue's progress. Mike Warburton of Grant Thornton explains: 'We took part in three trials of electronic filing and then gave up. They could only handle very simple returns. Every circumstance that we came up with, they found a reason as to why it would not work for filing by email. So our firm does not support electronic filing at the moment - although we are keeping our options open. The longer the delay, the more of a shambles it is going to be.' </p> <p>For me, it's already starting to be a nuisance. With some tax due to pay on 31 July, I would really like to know where I stand now. </p> <p>Do I abandon my desire to be at the forefront of electronic filing and return to pen and paper? Or do I stay on the trail of the \u00a310 discount, take the Revenue at its word and hope that a marvellous software system is in place by the end of the month? What the hell, I'll hang on. Life is nothing without a bit of adventure. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk\">www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk</a> The helpline can be reached on 0870 241 2092.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Filing your tax return through the internet produces the minimal benefit of a \u00a310 refund on your tax bill this year. But there are, in theory at least, other more useful spin-offs. If you give the Inland Revenue your email address, it will keep you updated on any developments and notify you of approaching deadlines. You can find out your tax liability quite quickly rather than waiting weeks to get a reply. And your tax return should also be easier to complete. You are less likely to lose a computer version than a paper one thrown into the back of a drawer. You can also key in the required information as and when you get those P60s, bank statements and other useful documents. That's the good news. The reality is that this electronic system is still a gleam in the eye of Somerset House. An understaffed and under-pressure software team produced a filing system that still, this year, does not quite work. I was one of the first 44,000 taxpayers to register at the Revenue website a couple of weeks ago. But even this was a trial of patience caused by computer glitches. You are told that you need to enter your reference number, your National Insurance number and your postcode. All these details appear on the front page of the paper tax return that was sent out in April. Confusingly, the reference number is marked 'official use' on the tax return - making me for one wonder if I, a mere taxpayer and not an official, should be using it at all. But, yes, you are supposed to use this number. Even more confusing was the fact that my application was three times rejected by the system even though I entered my details correctly. Making use of a box to send an email query to the Rev enue (limit your queries to a maximum of 250 characters, however), I got two bureaucratic replies, restating the requirements, but not addressing my problem. My third query elicited a very sympathetic reply, asking me to ring the helpline instead. When I rang , I discovered that the fault was theirs - and that I would never have discovered this myself. It does not bode well that such basic mistakes have occurred and that the Revenue has done so little to signpost the way round them on its registration website. Faults in the software mean many taxpayers will be precluded from registering if they do everything that is asked of them. A very helpful official on the helpline explained that I would be more likely to get through the registration process if I did not supply my email address or my postcode. In fact, the bare minimum required is to give your reference number and one of either your postcode or your NI number. When I went back, tried again and gave the minimal amount of information, my registration was accepted immediately. It was then a case of waiting 'seven to 10 days' before the Revenue sent me my 'user ID number' through a very slow snail mail indeed. But it did not particularly matter. Like the other 44,000 and anyone else who registers now, I am stuck at this point. You cannot complete your return until you have downloaded the Revenue's free self-assessment software - but (you guessed it) due to 'teething troubles' this is sev eral weeks late in arriving. In theory, it will be ready by the end of June. But, if the Revenue has had such a poor start, there could be more errors in the software when it can be downloaded. The major accountancy firms are not impressed with the Revenue's progress. Mike Warburton of Grant Thornton explains: 'We took part in three trials of electronic filing and then gave up. They could only handle very simple returns. Every circumstance that we came up with, they found a reason as to why it would not work for filing by email. So our firm does not support electronic filing at the moment - although we are keeping our options open. The longer the delay, the more of a shambles it is going to be.' For me, it's already starting to be a nuisance. With some tax due to pay on 31 July, I would really like to know where I stand now. Do I abandon my desire to be at the forefront of electronic filing and return to pen and paper? Or do I stay on the trail of the \u00a310 discount, take the Revenue at its word and hope that a marvellous software system is in place by the end of the month? What the hell, I'll hang on. Life is nothing without a bit of adventure. www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk The helpline can be reached on 0870 241 2092.",

On its own, this kind of rule would probably not lead to recession - but it could be an important factor.

      "bodyText": "Remember the bad old days of the early 1990s, when 75,000 homes were repossessed in one year and another 500,000 homeowners were in arrears? It was hardly surprising, given that about a million people were being made redundant each year. It may well be true that since those days our economic managers have become adept at running the show more smoothly, but the truth is that disasters are still likely to happen from time to time. Even the cleverest bankers and politicians can get their calculations wrong. A possible problem area in future is the stakeholder pension due to start next year, says Chris Lynas of accountant Smith &amp; Williamson. Although people will not be forced to save for a pension, Lynas is worried about the recessionary impact of 'compulsion' if it is introduced in a few years: 'It can cause a recession if people stop spending.

She is nearly two years into a three-year contract, funded by the National Lottery, but is on six months' maternity leave. </p> <p>Her son, Samuel, was born in March.

'On top of that,' she says, 'we will have to pay childcare.' </p> <p>James is an ear, nose and throat surgeon, but is currently a full-time student. He will complete his PhD on thyroid disease in March 2002. James will then look for a registrar's job. The family will move with him.

She should be able to find work wherever they choose to live but her job will always be at risk if funding is withdrawn. She also plans to have more children, so is likely to take more time off. </p> <p>Their rent is \u00a3750 a month. The mortgage on their Oxford home of \u00a3744 a month is mostly met by the \u00a3600 rent they receive. Their only debt is James's student loan, which costs them \u00a346 a month. He has been repaying it since 1995. They still owe \u00a31,800. Jackie and James have a small amount of money put by (\u00a36,000 in Smile cash Isas and \u00a31,000 in a Smile savings account) and, while Jackie was on full pay, they were able to save \u00a3200 a month.

      "body": "<p>No one knows when the next recession will be, but some of the most respected thinkers believe it could happen in the next year. Earlier this month the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) warned of the possibility of a hard landing. If the BIS is right we could see the usual hallmarks of recession - job losses, falling house prices, the re-emergence of negative equity, declining share prices and a rise in repossessions and bankruptcies. </p> <p>In one way or another that would affect most of us - even if it just meant us worrying more about job security, going out less often, spending less money and saving a bit more. </p> <p>There is no need to panic just yet. The BIS - the committee of central banks - says there is a 'risk' of economic problems ahead, not a likelihood, and certainly not a certainty. </p> <p>Making the connection between high-level economic debates and the realities of our daily lives is difficult for most people. In the West Midlands though, post Rover, people certainly understand the link between the high value of sterling and job losses for people who work in exporting companies. </p> <p>But economics is a notoriously difficult area when it comes to predictions. Recessions have a habit of coming when least expected and, even years later, economists will disagree in their analyses of what caused them. </p> <p>So even if most of the predictions are positive, it is worth assuming that there are difficult times around the corner - and building some caution into your financial plans. </p> <p>What worries the BIS and other eminent bodies most at the moment is the danger of a recession that starts in the US and spreads to the rest of the world. The finances of different countries are now so interlocked that a crisis in one of the major blocs - particularly the US, Asia and Europe - will quickly spread to the others. </p> <p>On its own, the UK economy is regarded by most as looking fairly healthy. 'We're looking at more of a softer landing,' says Martin Ellis, chief economist at the Halifax. That means that while some belt-tightening is taking place to stave off inflation - one of the main causes of recession - the measures are likely to be fairly gradual and relatively painless. So, for instance, while the Bank of England has raised base rates by 1 per cent over the past year - equal to an extra \u00a342 a month on a \u00a350,000 mortgage - it did not feel the need to put them up again this month. </p> <p>There are some who feel we have already suffered most of the pain needed to restrict demand and choke off excessive inflation. The latest house price surveys, from Halifax and Nationwide, both showed a slight decline in values in May. Other economic indicators have suggested a cooling in consumer demand. Standard Life's decision this month to launch a 25-year mortgage, capped at 6.25 per cent, is seen as a pointer towards low long-term inflation and interest rates. Steve Cleal, economist at the newly merged CGNU (the old Commercial and Norwich Unions) speaks for many who are in fairly optimistic mode when he says: 'We expect base rates to peak at about 6.5 per cent in three to six months' time, and then to drift lower next year.' </p> <p>This optimistic view about the UK was further boosted this month when the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) described our economic state as 'rather enviable'. </p> <p>So, for the moment, the eyes of most economists are on the US. At the end of this month the Federal Reserve will decide whether to raise interest rates in an attempt to depress consumer demand. But economists fear a recession being triggered if demand weakens too suddenly, or if the dollar plunges in response. Observers are worried that the Federal Reserve will miscalculate its intervention, raise interest rates too high, perhaps, and let the US economy stall. </p> <p>Signs of jitters in the US stock markets are already clear - notably the 35 per cent fall in the technology-dominated Nasdaq index in March, a mini-crash. </p> <p>The UK would not be insulated from problems that started in the US.

      "bodyText": "No one knows when the next recession will be, but some of the most respected thinkers believe it could happen in the next year. Earlier this month the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) warned of the possibility of a hard landing. If the BIS is right we could see the usual hallmarks of recession - job losses, falling house prices, the re-emergence of negative equity, declining share prices and a rise in repossessions and bankruptcies. In one way or another that would affect most of us - even if it just meant us worrying more about job security, going out less often, spending less money and saving a bit more. There is no need to panic just yet. The BIS - the committee of central banks - says there is a 'risk' of economic problems ahead, not a likelihood, and certainly not a certainty. Making the connection between high-level economic debates and the realities of our daily lives is difficult for most people. In the West Midlands though, post Rover, people certainly understand the link between the high value of sterling and job losses for people who work in exporting companies. But economics is a notoriously difficult area when it comes to predictions. Recessions have a habit of coming when least expected and, even years later, economists will disagree in their analyses of what caused them. So even if most of the predictions are positive, it is worth assuming that there are difficult times around the corner - and building some caution into your financial plans. What worries the BIS and other eminent bodies most at the moment is the danger of a recession that starts in the US and spreads to the rest of the world. The finances of different countries are now so interlocked that a crisis in one of the major blocs - particularly the US, Asia and Europe - will quickly spread to the others. On its own, the UK economy is regarded by most as looking fairly healthy. 'We're looking at more of a softer landing,' says Martin Ellis, chief economist at the Halifax. That means that while some belt-tightening is taking place to stave off inflation - one of the main causes of recession - the measures are likely to be fairly gradual and relatively painless. So, for instance, while the Bank of England has raised base rates by 1 per cent over the past year - equal to an extra \u00a342 a month on a \u00a350,000 mortgage - it did not feel the need to put them up again this month. There are some who feel we have already suffered most of the pain needed to restrict demand and choke off excessive inflation. The latest house price surveys, from Halifax and Nationwide, both showed a slight decline in values in May. Other economic indicators have suggested a cooling in consumer demand. Standard Life's decision this month to launch a 25-year mortgage, capped at 6.25 per cent, is seen as a pointer towards low long-term inflation and interest rates. Steve Cleal, economist at the newly merged CGNU (the old Commercial and Norwich Unions) speaks for many who are in fairly optimistic mode when he says: 'We expect base rates to peak at about 6.5 per cent in three to six months' time, and then to drift lower next year.' This optimistic view about the UK was further boosted this month when the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) described our economic state as 'rather enviable'. So, for the moment, the eyes of most economists are on the US. At the end of this month the Federal Reserve will decide whether to raise interest rates in an attempt to depress consumer demand. But economists fear a recession being triggered if demand weakens too suddenly, or if the dollar plunges in response. Observers are worried that the Federal Reserve will miscalculate its intervention, raise interest rates too high, perhaps, and let the US economy stall. Signs of jitters in the US stock markets are already clear - notably the 35 per cent fall in the technology-dominated Nasdaq index in March, a mini-crash. The UK would not be insulated from problems that started in the US. 'If there were a sharp fall in US share prices, that would probably drag down UK share prices,' says Ellis of the Halifax. 'And then you would see other effects here. Confidence would weaken. Unemployment would be likely to rise. Salary increases would be lower.' It used to be said that economic cycles went in seven-year periods - sweeping gradually or crashing from recession to boom in that timescale. Keeping an economy in permanently positive equilibrium is a very difficult task, given the blunt levers that are available to the bankers and chancellors who set interest rates and fiscal and economic policy. But current successes are making economists feel we are getting closer to this desirable position than we have ever managed before. A more difficult issue is understanding how fundamental industrial changes will also change our economic climate. How does the technological revolution affect the stability of our lives? If economists at PricewaterhouseCoopers are right, about 75 per cent of dotcoms are on course to run out of cash in the next two years. If their share prices have been talked up before the companies fail, there could be a lot of volatility in the stock markets. Looking at stock markets overall, Justin Urquhart-Stewart of Barclays Stockbrokers is one of those who expects US-led volatility to give us all 'a bumpy time' in the next few months. But even he is fairly optimistic. He believes that by the autumn, we could be seeing signs that the US economy is slowing without getting into recession. 'We could then see a lot more money coming back into the market,' he says. 'A lot of institutional money has been kept out of the market since February. So there is an awful lot of pensions and insurance money just waiting to be invested.' The simple laws of supply and demand suggest that this influx of investment would in itself put an upward pressure on share prices. What the experts think Martin Ellis, chief economist at the Halifax: 'There's always the possibility of a hard landing - but we don't think it's particularly likely.' Justin Urquhart-Stewart, Barclays Stockbrokers: 'We may well have a bumpy time until we do land.' Charles Levett-Scrivener, Towry Law financial advisers: 'If the US has a hard landing, the UK will have a hard landing. But it won't happen here independently.'

      "bodyText": "A quarter of all goods bought by young people in some British high streets are fakes, while a third of branded goods sold over the internet are likely to be counterfeit. New research has revealed that in the course of a single shopping trip in the North-West of England, one in four items seen by 16- to 25-year-old shoppers was fake. The research, carried out by ArmorGroup, a leading global security risk management group, reveals a massive explosion in the manufacturing and distribution of counterfeited goods over the past six months. But not only fashion-conscious youngsters are vulnerable. New techniques to slip fake goods, from computer software to cigarettes and trainers, through customs could mean up to 90 per cent of discounted branded goods bought on the 'grey market' are counterfeit. Howard Cottrell, executive director of IP Services at ArmorGroup, said: 'Anything with a brand identity is probably being counterfeited somewhere in the world, from tea bags to the most exclusive luxury item you can imagine.' Statistics about to be published reveal that counterfeiting could be costing the European Union up to \u00a3250 billion a year in lost revenue, with more than 100,000 EU jobs lost each year as a result of fraudulent trade. Cottrell believes counterfeiting operations have become so sophisticated that fraudsters anticipate consumer trends: 'Prototypes are stolen from international trade fairs and copied, often hitting the street before the original product itself.' Last year, Reebok's prototype DMX shoe was stolen from a display stand by a Chinese gang. The counterfeit shoes were on sale in Russia, Eastern Europe and the Far East within weeks. 'Some of the most violent and experienced criminals in the world have realised the profit to be made from counterfeiting,' he said. 'Why risk robbing banks or dealing in drugs when you can copy a \u00a3100 Microsoft CD for $2, or produce a \u00a32,250 case of Western cigarettes for around $180, especially as there's no likelihood of imprisonment if you're caught, only the lightest of fines?' Al Checkett, director of global security at Unilever Cosmetic International, agrees that some of the world's biggest criminals are using counterfeiting to make enormous profits and to launder 'dirty money' from robberies and drug deals. With more than 20 per cent of consumers saying they expect to conduct all their shopping from home via the internet, phone or post in five years' time, the problem can only get worse, according to Cottrell. Of the 50 major IT lawyers, 50 City analysts and 100 top directors questioned by ArmorGroup, 33 per cent had handed over responsibility for brand protection to their legal advisers. 'Many companies, including some big brand owners, don't yet have an anti-counterfeiting strategy in place,' said Cottrell. 'This is particularly the case with fast growth companies in sectors like telecoms and IT, as well as the dotcoms.' De La Rue, a lead provider in brand protection, believes modern technology has made fakes almost impossible to spot. 'There's an assumption that if you go into an established chain, you will be buying authentic goods,' said Andy Blundell, managing director of brand protection. 'Often the only time people find that they've been sold counterfeit goods is when something goes wrong and they try to return it, only to discover they haven't got the slightest protection.' Retailers in the North-West are particularly liable to face counterfeit goods because of the preponderance of illegal manufacturing outlets that have sprung up in traditional textile centres. John Anderson, secretary of the Anti-Counterfeit Group, representing brand owners such as Nike and Gucci, said: 'This is no longer the domain of lovable Del Boy-type rogues; these people are big-time criminals.'",

      "body": "<p><strong>Luke Jennings</strong> About five years ago I rang Marco because I was writing a piece about fishing and I knew that he was a pike fisherman. He was working at the Hyde Park Hotel at the time. What I thought was going to be a two-minute conversation was 45 minutes, with all this mania around him, pans clattering and Frenchmen swearing. We went off the next day to the River Kennet and had a fantastic time - I caught the biggest, which is rare. </p> <p> We got into the habit of setting off at 4.30am, when the roads are empty, and driving out to the countryside. It's fantastic starting on a winter's day when there's still mist over the water. You feel the need to fish welling up inside you, the need to go to some watery place. For me, it does something that nothing else does. One of the things about fishing with Marco is that he feels exactly the same.

It was very cold, in the middle of winter, and we were both feeling cheesed off. So Marco said, 'Well, look, at least let's have some breakfast' and picked up his mobile phone, and 10 minutes later, across Hyde Park came this line of waiters in black suits carrying a silver service, a table and two chairs.

There's a mystical element to fishing. People say it's enough just to go to a beautiful place, not enough for me - or Marco - we want to catch, to outsmart the fish.

      "bodyText": "Luke Jennings About five years ago I rang Marco because I was writing a piece about fishing and I knew that he was a pike fisherman. He was working at the Hyde Park Hotel at the time. What I thought was going to be a two-minute conversation was 45 minutes, with all this mania around him, pans clattering and Frenchmen swearing. We went off the next day to the River Kennet and had a fantastic time - I caught the biggest, which is rare. We got into the habit of setting off at 4.30am, when the roads are empty, and driving out to the countryside. It's fantastic starting on a winter's day when there's still mist over the water. You feel the need to fish welling up inside you, the need to go to some watery place. For me, it does something that nothing else does. One of the things about fishing with Marco is that he feels exactly the same. You get there, tear through breakfast and just get straight in. Marco is a very aggressive fisherman - he won't take no for an answer, he'll keep changing techniques until he gets a result. I'm more of a watcher and a waiter. Marco gets impatient with failure and will go on trying different things until he gets it right.

Just feel these chapter headings: 'Steering for smoothness'; 'Avoiding clutch abuse'; 'The pleasures of cornering'. Fantastic! It even uses a sophisticated blonde in a red MG coup\u00e9 to demonstrate handling characteristics and precision overtaking and to show that wholesome motoring habits are not just of interest to RAC men with hair sprouting out of their ears. </p> <p>The first thing to remember is not to read it while you are actually driving, as it can hamper concentration. By the time my instructor Richard arrives to give me a real-time session, I have gone as far as I can with the book - remembering to 'feed' the steering wheel from hand to hand instead of tying my arms in a knot, being more tolerant of the idiot in front, trying to reverse into a tight spot without nudging other people's cars out of the way. I have even made an inane attempt at 'live' commentary as I tool along, which is intended to put an edge on my long-range observation, but looks to the outside world like someone talking to themselves. 'Er... brow of a hill coming up, um, parked motorbike, horse neighing, lamp post...' </p> <p>But the importance of spotting hazards before they become hazards can't be overstated, says Richard, who is an old-school, ex-Met police officer with a record of experience in advanced tuition and traffic behaviour and distressing accidents as long as your small intestine. If safety is the faith, Richard is its first apostle and arch proselytiser. He's spent too many years standing in too many people's living rooms delivering bad news not to be. And it's not rocket science, he says. It's basically a question of seeing what's coming up, and 'engineering' the time and space to respond. 'Everything else slots into place.' </p> <p>We sit through a video showing a windscreen view of a busy high street - buses pulling out, delivery vans with hazard-warning lights flashing, elderly shoppers at the kerb looking every way except the right one.

It's all about risk reduction. But you can't force it on people, he says. You have to make believers out of them. In some of Richard's sessions with corporate fleet drivers - hardened Mondeo men to whom the merest suggestion that they might try travelling at less than the speed of light would be to call their very rephood into question - the job of persuasion is harder than it ought to be. He switches the video back on and runs an animated reconstruction of a pile-up in 1991 in which 58 vehicles were involved and 10 people died. 'I always show people this before we go out on the road,' he says. </p> <p>The film is simply made - little computer-generated shapes jerking their way down the motorway - and yet to see such wanton stupidity unfolding in front of your eyes is unexpectedly affecting. This is the truck that lost itself in the fog. Here is the car immediately following. Here are the two further back, doing 60, and then all the others, bumper to bumper - this is the explosion, the fire, car after car ploughing blindly into the cumulative wreckage. 'Most of the dead were in this area,' Richard says, pointing to what is now an indistinguishable mass of black. And it all happened in minutes. </p> <p>At last, we're in the car, me behind the wheel ostentatiously adjusting my mirror and seat and trying to get my handbrake-clutch-ignition-gear configuration in the right order. I have cleared the car of debris for the occasion, but you can never be sure that a plastic Darth Vader figurine won't come rolling out from nowhere and jam itself under the brake pedal just as I'm approaching the level crossing with the nonstop 12.03 to Liverpool Street thundering through. And then we're off, moving up a country lane, checking my mirror with pathological regularity. I ask Richard about the new orthodoxy of not bothering to change down when there's a roundabout or traffic lights coming up. Like many of the techniques in the manual, it's not written in stone, he explains. It's a way of unfettering your mind, so that if one of those deer on the warning signs does happen to leap over a hedge, you're not still busy wondering what gear you should be in. But we shouldn't burden ourselves with too much detail, he says. 'I've never dealt with a crash that has come about as a result of someone changing gears too often.' </p> <p>He shows me how to corner for pleasure, which means getting round a bend using the accelerator rather than the brakes; he offers his own rapid-fire commentary on peripheral hazards - mud on the road, woman pruning hedge, skid marks_ We hit the motorways, the M11, the M25, Richard offering suggestions for improvement, praising generously when I do something right: 'Yes - I liked the way you checked the sliproad'; 'Yes - I liked the way you signalled to change lane after the car passed you.'

      "body": "<p>Richard Francis's novel Taking Apart the Poco Poco begins inside the obsessive mind of a character called Raymond, who sleeps in his kitchen, spends his first few moments after waking savouring the smells in the kitchen and howls when he finds a chicken on the washing machine. It's a page or three before the reader realises that Raymond is actually a dog. It's neatly done.</p> <p>However, the surprise of discovering that you're seeing the world from the point of one of nature's dumber mutts is nothing compared to the stunt the author pulls 150 pages later. Margaret, the novel's central adult female character, is in hospital to have a lump in her breast examined. She strikes up a conversation with someone she takes to be a waiting husband and is amazed - as we are - to find she's talking to a fellow patient.</p> <p>A bloke with breast cancer? Most of us find it easier to get our heads around the idea of a talking dog. Male breast cancer is like open government, British manufacturing or the Tottenham Hotspur defence, a contradiction in terms, an oxymoron, even. I mean, you can't call those things breasts, can you? Well, you can, and they do. Doctors diagnose over 200 men with breast cancer every year. That's a tiny number compared to the thousands of women, but for the men concerned, the rarity of their condition comes as no consolation, quite the opposite. Each has to deal with a disease he thought he had no chance of getting.</p> <p>Stuart Gilder was one. And the former policeman is honest enough to admit: 'I burst into tears the moment the door was closed. So did my wife. I had had a feeling that it was cancer but when they tell you it's still a terrible shock. You wonder fleetingly \"How long have I got?\" We didn't say much on the way home - we both thought a lot. I kept thinking how each journey begins with a single step and I had no intention of giving up. I decided cancer would be a word I'd speak not whisper.'</p> <p>Stuart was 51. Two years later, after a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, he's applying to become a Breast Cancer Care volunteer to help other men in the same unexpected predicament.</p> <p>Men make up less than 1 per cent of breast cancer cases. In 1993, the last year for which figures for new cases are available, there were 248 men diagnosed in England and Wales compared to 30,495 women. More recent figures are available for deaths from the disease, with 76 male and 11,759 female mortalities in 1998.</p> <p>Dr Eadie Heyderman's Coping With Breast Cancer is one of the few books on the subject to discuss the condition in males. She says women and men have different, almost opposite, attitudes to their breasts. 'Women think every breast lump must be cancer while men think a lump in the chest can't be cancer and ignore it,' she says. 'The outcome for men and women is actually pretty similar for the same type and stage of the disease, but men are more likely to wait before seeking treatment until the lump has broken through the skin to form an ulcer or become attached to the chest wall.'</p> <p>The risk of breast cancer increases with age. Although it's younger women who are most worried about the disease, it's older women who get it. Eighty per cent of cases occur in women over 50. The highest risk group is women in their sixties. Men are more likely to get it in their seventies.</p> <p>Cancer is caused by carcinogens in the environment, but exactly why one person should succumb to them and another not depends on genetic and other individual factors. Professor Ian Fentiman, the professor of surgical oncology at London's Guy's Hospital, who has treated several men with breast cancer says, 'Cancer-causing carcinogens enter the body from food, water or the air and damage the body's DNA. Usually this is repaired, but as the repair mechanism becomes less effective with age, the risk increases.'</p> <p>In female breast cancer, hormones, particularly oestrogen, play a major role. They don't cause it, but do encourage its growth. Kate Law of the Cancer Research Campaign says, 'Each time a woman ovulates she releases a surge of oestrogen; the more often this happens in a lifetime the greater the risk of breast cancer.'</p> <p>Men have far lower levels of oestrogen which probably explains breast cancer's later age of onset and far lower incidence among them, but hormones are still involved. Hormone-blocking drugs, such as Tamoxifan, are used in the treatment of both sexes while men who have Klinefelter's syndrome, in which they are born with an extra female chromosome, have a 20 times greater risk of breast cancer than the average male. But Fentiman, who also advises the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, stresses that 'male breast cancer is not a sign that you're less of a man. It's just bad luck.'</p> <p>When it comes to breast cancer, size matters. Women have far more breast tissue for lumps to develop in. However, men with larger breasts are also at marginally greater risk. Indeed, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund believes men who are grossly overweight by the time they are 30 may double their risk of breast cancer.

      "bodyText": "Richard Francis's novel Taking Apart the Poco Poco begins inside the obsessive mind of a character called Raymond, who sleeps in his kitchen, spends his first few moments after waking savouring the smells in the kitchen and howls when he finds a chicken on the washing machine. It's a page or three before the reader realises that Raymond is actually a dog. It's neatly done. However, the surprise of discovering that you're seeing the world from the point of one of nature's dumber mutts is nothing compared to the stunt the author pulls 150 pages later. Margaret, the novel's central adult female character, is in hospital to have a lump in her breast examined. She strikes up a conversation with someone she takes to be a waiting husband and is amazed - as we are - to find she's talking to a fellow patient. A bloke with breast cancer? Most of us find it easier to get our heads around the idea of a talking dog. Male breast cancer is like open government, British manufacturing or the Tottenham Hotspur defence, a contradiction in terms, an oxymoron, even. I mean, you can't call those things breasts, can you? Well, you can, and they do. Doctors diagnose over 200 men with breast cancer every year. That's a tiny number compared to the thousands of women, but for the men concerned, the rarity of their condition comes as no consolation, quite the opposite. Each has to deal with a disease he thought he had no chance of getting. Stuart Gilder was one. And the former policeman is honest enough to admit: 'I burst into tears the moment the door was closed. So did my wife. I had had a feeling that it was cancer but when they tell you it's still a terrible shock. You wonder fleetingly \"How long have I got?\" We didn't say much on the way home - we both thought a lot. I kept thinking how each journey begins with a single step and I had no intention of giving up. I decided cancer would be a word I'd speak not whisper.' Stuart was 51. Two years later, after a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, he's applying to become a Breast Cancer Care volunteer to help other men in the same unexpected predicament. Men make up less than 1 per cent of breast cancer cases. In 1993, the last year for which figures for new cases are available, there were 248 men diagnosed in England and Wales compared to 30,495 women. More recent figures are available for deaths from the disease, with 76 male and 11,759 female mortalities in 1998. Dr Eadie Heyderman's Coping With Breast Cancer is one of the few books on the subject to discuss the condition in males. She says women and men have different, almost opposite, attitudes to their breasts. 'Women think every breast lump must be cancer while men think a lump in the chest can't be cancer and ignore it,' she says. 'The outcome for men and women is actually pretty similar for the same type and stage of the disease, but men are more likely to wait before seeking treatment until the lump has broken through the skin to form an ulcer or become attached to the chest wall.' The risk of breast cancer increases with age. Although it's younger women who are most worried about the disease, it's older women who get it. Eighty per cent of cases occur in women over 50. The highest risk group is women in their sixties. Men are more likely to get it in their seventies. Cancer is caused by carcinogens in the environment, but exactly why one person should succumb to them and another not depends on genetic and other individual factors. Professor Ian Fentiman, the professor of surgical oncology at London's Guy's Hospital, who has treated several men with breast cancer says, 'Cancer-causing carcinogens enter the body from food, water or the air and damage the body's DNA. Usually this is repaired, but as the repair mechanism becomes less effective with age, the risk increases.' In female breast cancer, hormones, particularly oestrogen, play a major role. They don't cause it, but do encourage its growth. Kate Law of the Cancer Research Campaign says, 'Each time a woman ovulates she releases a surge of oestrogen; the more often this happens in a lifetime the greater the risk of breast cancer.' Men have far lower levels of oestrogen which probably explains breast cancer's later age of onset and far lower incidence among them, but hormones are still involved. Hormone-blocking drugs, such as Tamoxifan, are used in the treatment of both sexes while men who have Klinefelter's syndrome, in which they are born with an extra female chromosome, have a 20 times greater risk of breast cancer than the average male. But Fentiman, who also advises the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, stresses that 'male breast cancer is not a sign that you're less of a man. It's just bad luck.' When it comes to breast cancer, size matters. Women have far more breast tissue for lumps to develop in. However, men with larger breasts are also at marginally greater risk. Indeed, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund believes men who are grossly overweight by the time they are 30 may double their risk of breast cancer. Interestingly, this theoretical risk is not reflected - yet - in the figures: obesity is increasing, male cancer rates are not. They've stayed pretty static since 1971, in which time the number of female cases has increased by nearly a third. Liver disease can also increase male oestrogen levels. Egypt has one of the highest rates of male breast cancer - 5 per cent of cases compared to 1 per cent in the UK - because of the prevalence of the infectious liver disease bilharzia. 'In equatorial Africa, male breast cancer can rise to 20 per cent of cases,' says Fentiman, 'again an infection is probably the cause. But working in very high temperatures can also be a factor, as it stops the testes working so well and upsets the testosterone-oestrogen balance. It used to affect steelworkers, for example.' Diet is also a hot topic with regard to breast cancer. Dairy products are currently in the dock, but it's unlikely to be as simple as that. 'Japanese women have a low incidence of breast cancer in Japan,' says Kate Law, 'but when they move to the west, their incidence goes up to western levels. It may be because they start eating fatty foods which increases their oestrogen levels or it could be something in the Japanese diet, soya, perhaps, which protects against cancer.' Genealogy is certainly involved, particularly for men. About 5 to 10 per cent of women who develop the disease come from families with a history of female breast cancer. Among men this proportion rises to one in five. Mutations in two genes have been identified as the guilty parties and a test is now available for them. Stephen Wilshere was 69 when he was diagnosed with breast cancer, having already lost his mother and a daughter to the disease. He had the test and the varying reactions of his family are a case study in the issues surrounding genetic testing.

Day boats fish overnight and return with a fresh catch the morning after - this is what top fishmongers particularly prize. </p> <p> <b> Steve Hatt 88 Essex Road, London N1 (020 7226 3963) </b> Steve Hatt is the fourth generation of his family to run the shop (opened in 1898) and, quite apart from being one of London's top merchants, he is one of the most passionate of all fish retailers about the health of the home fishing industry. This has, he says, been destroyed from within over the past two decades, as successive governments have bargained away rights and quotas in exchange for things they consider more important. Hence most of our fish is imported, even cod and haddock. We gave up valuable fishing grounds to Iceland, the Faroes and Norway, and now import as much as 95 per cent of our haddock. Because continentals value their fish more highly than we do, they fight harder for their rights, and also control prices. Spaniards and Italians are prepared to pay far more for prime quality fish so they get the pick, while too many British customers are satisfied with second best, usually available in supermarkets. The message is clear: unless we support independent fishmongers, demand the best, and are prepared to pay for it, the situation will get steadily worse. </p> <p> <b> Coakley-Greene Stall 41c, The Market, Oxford Street, Swansea (01792 653 416)</b> </p> <p> A family business since 1856, supplying anything from tiny whitebait via marlin and tuna to a whole 400lb shark. Sources include the Seychelles (for parrot fish, groupers and snappers). Plus local day boats; bass is in season. </p> <p> <b> Pembrokeshire Sea Fayre The J Shed, Milford Docks, Milford Haven (01646 697 999) </b> Supplies live shellfish, including crab and lobster from local boats, packed in seaweed; also rod-caught sea bass and exotics including swordfish and marlin from the Middle East. </p> <p> <b> Fish Cuisine 4 Frogmore Street, Abergavenny (01873 856 989) </b> Now separate from the hotel and catering supplier, run by Richard Gafney, who has spent 20 years in the fish trade. The shop sells all sorts of interesting items, but fish accounts for 75 per cent of business, and it is launching a seafood bar for oysters, cockles, lobster salad, etc. Also does mail order (carriage free over \u00a325). </p> <p> <b> Australian Seafood Company 95 Ballards Lane, London N3 (020 8371 8369) </b> Supplier of live Down Under shellfish, such as marrons and yabbies (\u00a313.10 per kg, about a dozen), as well as Balmain and fresh, uncooked Moreton Bay bugs (\u00a314.95 per kg, about four) which need just seven minutes in boiling water. Direct, controlled supply also enables it to sell fresh reef fish such as barramundi, coral trout, red emperor and snapper, processed in Perth, Western Australia, and flown refrigerated to London within 72 hours. Call to ask about delivery in central London. </p> <p> <b> JH Mann, 7 Hillsborough Road Sheffield (0114 234 3538) </b> Sourcing fish from ports around the country, Peter Mann (third generation in the family business) finds that he is selling more varieties than 10 years ago, partly thanks to a demand fuelled by television cookery programmes. Cod is still his predominant line, but stocks are declining, and the big tasty ones are being replaced by ever smaller ones - a clear indication that the fishing industry is in crisis. As cod has become more expensive, it has worked its way up the ladder to become 'a classy fish', featuring in smart restaurants - another sign of the times. </p> <p> <b> E Ashton Central Market, St Mary's Street, Cardiff (01222 229 201) </b> While Jonathan Adams buys from day boats and sells live lobsters (\u00a319.90 per kg) and crabs (\u00a35.50 per kg), he also turns up a few farmed fish. Sea bass are reared in France and Greece, turbot in Scotland and Spain; warmer waters generally produce bigger fish more quickly, and he maintains that the quality is excellent, supplies are regular, stocks of wild fish stand a better chance of recovering, and the result is less expensive. Another string to his bow is a range of marlin, swordfish, green-lipped mussels, yabbies, red snapper and parrot fish, sourced from Australia, the Seychelles and Saudi Arabia, generally delivered within 48 hours of being caught. </p> <p> <b> Other recommended fishmongers </b></p> <p><b> Wellgate Fisheries </b> 5 Wellgate, Clitheroe, Lancashire (01200 423 511) </p> <p> <b> Direct Fish </b> High Street Market, Arndale Centre, High Street, Manchester (0161 832 8908) </p> <p> <b> Charles Brickland </b> 5 Pepper Row, Chester (01244 327 867) </p> <p> <b> Keracher </b> Units 5/8, Whitefriars Street, Perth (01738 638 454) </p> <p> <b> Cross of York </b> 90 Clifton, York (01904 624 838); also at 3 &amp; 4 Newgate Market, York </p> <p> <b> Smoked fish</b> </p> <p> <b> Severn &amp; Wye Smokery Chaxhill Westbury-on-Severn, Gloucestershire (01452 760 190) </b> Richard Cook smokes salmon, trout, eel and sea bass caught in the estuaries of these two rivers. Wild salmon (in season now) is supplemented by farmed salmon at other times, and at 16 to 18 hours, the smoke is quite heavy: prices vary from pre-sliced smoked farmed salmon at \u00a318 per kg to an unsliced side of whole salmon at \u00a331.50 per kg. Orders over \u00a365 are carriage free. </p> <p> <b> Inverawe Smokehouses Taynuilt, Argyll (01866 822 446; <a href=\"http://www.smokedsalmon.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.smokedsalmon.co.uk</a>)</b> </p> <p> Farmed salmon is used because it is regularly available, but diet makes a difference (too much fat from force feeding to get the weight up produces an oily fish) so Inverawe is careful to select mature, fitter and properly fed fish. A lengthy 48-hour smoke over oak chips gives this salmon a strong flavour. Sold in several formats, with prices including carriage - eg, 4oz packs (\u00a35.95) to whole trimmed sides (\u00a325.55) - plus 50 more lines including smoked trout, eel, halibut, cod's roe, gravlax, etc. </p> <p> <b> Cley Smokehouse High Street, Cley-next-the-Sea, Norfolk (01263 740 282) </b> Kippers don't come much juicier than this. Large Norwegian herring are part of the secret, caught in the autumn when they have a high fat content, and frozen for use throughout the year. At the shop-cum-smokery in this small village, they are briefly brined, then cold smoked over smouldering oak sawdust overnight, or up to 48 hours, depending on conditions. Pay \u00a33.96 per kg (about four kippers). There is no mail order, but the shop is open seven days a week. </p> <p> <b> Bridfish Unit 1 Old Laundry Industrial Estate, Sea Road North, Bridport, Dorset (01308 456 306) </b> Patrick Gibb's award-winning kippers are also produced from frozen Norwegian </p> <p> <b> A Pert of Arbroath 244 High Street, Arbroath, Angus (01241 873 522); also at 3 High Street, Kirriemuir (01575 574 483) </b> Producer of whole hot-smoked haddock, better known as Arbroath Smokies. The small fish, bought daily from Aberdeen market 50 miles away, are split open and cleaned but not filleted, before being salted for about two hours. After the salt is washed off, the fish are tied together in pairs and hung up to dry, then smoked and cooked in a concrete-lined pit over whole pieces of oak or beech. It takes only 30 to 40 minutes, each fish being removed when it is ready. Supplies at the moment are 'desperate', as the fish are just recovering from spawning - prices therefore are liable to fluctuation. </p> <p> <b> Specialists </b></p> <p><b> Cornish Fish Direct The Pilchard Works, Tolcarne, Newlyn, Penzance, Cornwall (01736 332 112; <a href=\"http://www.cornishfish.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.cornishfish.com</a>) </b> If you think pilchards and sardines only come in tins, take the kids along to The Pilchard Works, a working museum open every day from Easter to October. A pilchard is an adult sardine, and Nick Howell sells them fresh - line caught from day boats and filleted - at around \u00a32 to \u00a32.20 per kg. Fish landed Thursday morning are sent out the same day, to be with you by Friday morning (orders over \u00a340 carriage free). He also salts larger fillets for three months, and puts them in oil (\u00a32.80 for a 200g jar): try them as a meatier and more satisfying alternative to anchovy. </p> <p> <b> James Baxter &amp; Son Thornton Road, Morecambe, Lancashire (01524 410 910) </b> Potted brown shrimps are a great delight, not least because all the hard work is done for you, and the butter is a bonus. Boiled in sea water, shelled and potted, they are made to the same recipe that has been in the Baxter family (now in its sixth generation in the business) since the 19th century. Sold in 2oz (57g) and 7oz (200g) cartons, plus a new 3.5oz (100g) version. Price depends on size of order (eg, 20 x 2oz cartons cost \u00a362 including carriage). </p> <p> <b> RE Campbell 72 Maltings Road, Bagley's Lane, London SW6 (020 7371 5566) </b> Father Bob Campbell and son Robin trade in impeccably sourced Iranian caviar from the Caspian Sea. Thanks to Russian mafiosi and contraband Iranian dealers, there is a lot of suspect caviar about, but theirs comes with a CITES certificate from a licensed trading corporation in Iran, with every tin sealed and numbered at source. Beluga (pale grey to black) 'really does taste best' and costs \u00a3275 for 250g (\u00a355 for 50g); Oscietre (smaller, pale brown eggs) is \u00a3175 (\u00a340 for 50g); Sevruga (smaller still, dark grey) is \u00a3135 (\u00a327 for 50g). Store between 0 and -2 C for up to 14 days, eat within 24 hours of opening, and use a non-metallic spoon (plastic, horn, wood or mother of pearl). </p> <p> <b> Caviar House 161 Piccadilly, London W1 (020 7409 7171) </b> A combination of restaurant, seafood bar and take-away, this Copenhagen-based family company, founded in 1950, also has airport shops at Heathrow and Gatwick. Eggs from Beluga, the largest and rarest sturgeon, cost \u00a3740 for 250g (\u00a3160 for 50g); Oscietre is \u00a3285 (\u00a360 for 50g); and Sevruga, which accounts for 70 per cent of the total catch, is \u00a3246 (\u00a353 for 50g). They also sell Royal Black (from 40-year-old Oscietre sturgeon) and Imperial (from 80-year-old Oscietre). </p> <p> <b> Pembrokeshire Meat &amp; Fish 21 St Govans Centre, Pembroke Dock, Pembrokeshire (01646 685 747) </b> As stocks of wild sea trout decline, so the incentive to farm them becomes more attractive, if only to relieve pressure on the wild. They are a delicacy - a brown trout that runs away to sea and ends up halfway to being a salmon - known in Wales as sewin. Stephen Thomson of Haven Harvest oversees their progression from 100g freshwater tiddlers to adults weighing anything from 1.5 to 4 or 5lb, transferring them to seawater after about a year. Milford Haven had a rough time a few years ago when the Sea Empress ran aground, but this is now a Special Area of Conservation, with low-density stocking, no chemical treatments, and a strong current to put some muscle on the fish. He supplies several outlets, but Pembrokeshire Meat &amp; Fish can get hold of them quickly (telephone first), and sells them at \u00a34 per lb. </p> <p> <b> Fish and chips</b> </p> <p> When it comes to fish and chips, forget day boats that potter round the coast. This is big business, and the white fish is typically 'frozen at sea' in factory ships within a few hours of being hauled into the boat. Although they are a national institution, fish and chip shops vary considerably in quality, depending on the skill and care of the owner. </p> <p> <b> Olley's Fish Experience 67 Norwood Road, London SE24 (020 8671 8259) </b> As the name suggests, this is no ordinary chippie. Order from curved, gold-rimmed blackboards, and be prepared for some of the best fish and chips in London, if not the country: cod, haddock, hake, salmon, monk, halibut and skate are all battered and deep-fried to order. Harry Niazi is fanatical, keeping his freshly prepared batter at 1 to 3 C, so it forms a proper seal when it hits the 180 C groundnut oil. Chips are blanched first (it makes a big difference) and cooked at 170 C until crisp. Mushy peas are home-made; 'no curry sauce'. Take away or eat in. </p> <p> <b> Park Chippy Station Road, Suffield Park, Cromer, Norfolk (01263 513 050) </b> Dave Audley is happy with 'frozen at sea' fish because it is filleted, cleaned, processed and frozen within three hours of being caught; his range includes huss, plaice, skate wing, haddock and cod in five sizes, from children's to a 14oz whopper. He uses beef dripping for fying ('It gives a better flavour'), and never lets a piece of fish anywhere near the fat until it has been ordered and paid for: nothing is worse than fried fish that has to hang around waiting for a customer to stroll in. Chips are soaked in a solution that allows them to dry quickly, thus producing a better chip, which also stops them absorbing too much fat. Only take away, but there are queues at peak times. </p> <p> <b> Bizzie Lizzie's 36 Swadford Street, Skipton, North Yorkshire (01756 793 189) </b> Last year's winner of the Best Fish &amp; Chip Shop in the Country, Jean Ritson is another devotee of 'frozen at sea' white fish, because it is 'the best you can get'. The defrosted cod and haddock are portioned, and pin bones removed, before being dunked in batter that is made fresh three or four times a day. Chunky chips are blanched in cooler dripping first and allowed to rest before being crisped off in baskets when needed; that way there is always a good supply ready when coach parties turn up, but nothing spoiling if things are quiet. Cod, chips and peas to take away cost \u00a32.80, and there is a restaurant as well. </p> <p> <b> Other recommended fish and chip shops </b></p> <p><b> Henry Higgins </b> 47 Station Road, Woburn Sands, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire (01908 583 144) </p> <p> <b> Belfield's </b> 72 Parliament Street, Burnley, Lancashire (01282 428 042) </p> <p> <b> Fish'n' Chick'n </b> 9 The Mall, Bar Hill, Cambridge (01954 781 627) </p> <p> <b> Hanbury's Licensed Fish Restaurant </b> Princes Street, Torquay, Devon (01803 329 928) </p> <p> <b> P &amp; M Fionda </b> 231 Low Waters Road, Hamilton, Strathclyde (01698 281 877) </p> <p> <b> Croesy Fish Bar </b> 7 Edlogan Square, Croes-y-Ceiliog, Cwmbran, Gwent (01633 860 033) </p> <p> <b> Brady's </b> 513 Old York Road, London SW18 (020 8877 9599) </p> <p> <b> Two Brothers Fish Restaurant </b> 297 Regent's Park Road, London N3 (020 8346 0469) </p> <p> <b> Upper Street Fish Shop </b> 324 Upper Street, London N1 (020 7359 1401) </p> <p> <b> Shellfish</b> </p> <p> Live shellfish are available for those who enjoy preparing them personally, and ready cooked for those who prefer the easy route. The chances of finding a bad oyster these days are slim in view of the rigorous purification process they have to undergo. Mussels are available now, but autumn and winter are the best seasons. </p> <p> <b> Menai Oysters Tal-y-Bont Bach, Dwyran, Anglesey (01248 430 878) </b> Sean Krijnen trained as a marine biologist, specialising in shellfish for his MSc, and took over this business on the south-west corner of Anglesey eight years ago. He grows Pacific oysters from seed (natives don't like the conditions here) and it takes about three years for them to reach maturity and a saleable size of 90g to 120g. Mail-order deliveries are despatched at 4.30pm the day before to arrive Tuesday to Friday: \u00a314 for one dozen; \u00a318 for two; \u00a322 for three, etc, or \u00a340 for 100 oysters (prices include carriage). </p> <p> <b> Fish on the Quay Cadwgan Place, Aberaeron (01545 571 294) </b> Peter Bottoms reckons to 'shift more shellfish than anyone else in west Wales', specialising in crab, lobsters and prawns from the Bay (buy them live, or still warm from the pot), plus anything from local day boats. He is also part of the Cardigan Bay Fishermen's Association that takes conservation seriously, returning egg-laden hen lobsters to the sea, with the help of a small EU grant, to ensure the viability of future generations of both lobsters and fishermen. Alternatively, eat seafood salads, chowder and fresh mackerel across the courtyard at <b> Hive on the Quay </b> (01545 570 445, open daytime only, seven days a week, until September) which Peter Bottoms supplies. Note also the Cardigan Bay Fish Festival in Aberaeron Harbour on 9 July, with everything from sea shanties to chef demonstrations. </p> <p> <b> Mail order</b> </p> <p> Far from being second best, mail order is often the preferred way to buy spankingly fresh fish, cutting out the middleman. Typically landed from day boats, it can be on its way to you within a few hours. The cost of transport (which can be shared with friends) is easily compensated for by the high quality. While some of the previous entries offer mail-order delivery, the following are specialists. </p> <p> <b> Quayside Fish The Harbourside, Porthleven, Cornwall (01326 562 008) </b> John Strike's fish comes from day boats, sold direct at the harbourside and by mail order at \u00a38.50 per delivery: refrigerated orders leave by 4pm, and arrive before noon next day. It will supply whatever is in season - take the advice about best buys (currently plaice and turbot) with confidence - and will send it as whole fish, fillets, or whatever you require. Live lobsters are \u00a315.90 per kg, and crabmeat is second to none: white (usually from big-clawed cock crabs) is \u00a323.95 per kg, but brown (typically from a hen crab) is \u00a39.70 per kg and is an underrated joy - make it into soup or spread it on sandwiches. It also smokes its own fish, from large haddock via smoked salmon to popular hot roast-smoked salmon. </p> <p> <b> Club Chef Direct Lakeside, Bridgewater Road, Barrow Gurney, Bristol (01793 433 733; <a href=\"http://www.clubchefdirect.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.clubchefdirect.co.uk</a>) </b> Top restaurants always seem to get magnificent supplies - enormous scallops in the shell, razor clams, live lobster, skate wings, wild sea bass and sea trout - that are far better than anything you ever see in a shop. Together with Steve Downey of Heritage Fine Foods, a few of them (Rick Stein, Shaun Hill, Pierre Koffmann, Franco Taruschio, Philip Howard, Richard Corrigan and others) have formed a group to supply ordinary retail customers with exactly the prime-quality produce they use themselves. Subscription to the club costs \u00a3100 pa (other supplies include meat, poultry, offal, mushrooms, game and more), and while Steve Downey organises supplies - guaranteed next-day delivery for members, typically at prices below high-street retailers - the chefs will contribute recipes to a monthly magazine (for June, Sally Clarke on crab and Michel Roux Jr on red mullet). Non members can contact <b> Heritage Fine Foods </b> (01275 474 707) for similar supplies without the bells and whistles. </p> <p> <b> Loch Fyne Oysters Clachan, Cairndow, Argyll (01499 600 264; <a href=\"http://www.loch-fyne.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.loch-fyne.com</a>) </b> Pacific oysters are grown from seed in the loch, packed in wooden panniers, and cost \u00a39 per dozen by overnight delivery (\u00a35 carriage for orders under \u00a360). Smoked salmon is among the very best, sourced from Loch Duart, with sustainability a central aim: 'We do not smoke wild salmon, which is now effectively an endangered species.' An unsliced side (the best way to buy it) weighing around 1kg costs \u00a321, while the luxurious Kinglas fillet is \u00a318.50 for approximately 500g. There are lots of other lines, from gravlax to langoustines and smoked cod's roe, and personal callers can eat in the adjoining oyster bar.

Nigel Smith reckons that conditions in the Exe produce a creamier oyster than those from the east coast at Colchester or Whitstable, an effect enhanced by draining off the first water after opening and resting them for 10 minutes. Small to medium-sized oysters are delivered packed in seaweed Tuesday to Friday, within 24 hours of the order: \u00a316 for a dozen, up to \u00a352 for 10 dozen (prices include delivery).

Wild salmon (in season now) is supplemented by farmed salmon at other times, and at 16 to 18 hours, the smoke is quite heavy: prices vary from pre-sliced smoked farmed salmon at \u00a318 per kg to an unsliced side of whole salmon at \u00a331.50 per kg. Orders over \u00a365 are carriage free. Inverawe Smokehouses Taynuilt, Argyll (01866 822 446; www.smokedsalmon.co.uk) Farmed salmon is used because it is regularly available, but diet makes a difference (too much fat from force feeding to get the weight up produces an oily fish) so Inverawe is careful to select mature, fitter and properly fed fish. A lengthy 48-hour smoke over oak chips gives this salmon a strong flavour. Sold in several formats, with prices including carriage - eg, 4oz packs (\u00a35.95) to whole trimmed sides (\u00a325.55) - plus 50 more lines including smoked trout, eel, halibut, cod's roe, gravlax, etc. Cley Smokehouse High Street, Cley-next-the-Sea, Norfolk (01263 740 282) Kippers don't come much juicier than this. Large Norwegian herring are part of the secret, caught in the autumn when they have a high fat content, and frozen for use throughout the year. At the shop-cum-smokery in this small village, they are briefly brined, then cold smoked over smouldering oak sawdust overnight, or up to 48 hours, depending on conditions. Pay \u00a33.96 per kg (about four kippers). There is no mail order, but the shop is open seven days a week. Bridfish Unit 1 Old Laundry Industrial Estate, Sea Road North, Bridport, Dorset (01308 456 306) Patrick Gibb's award-winning kippers are also produced from frozen Norwegian A Pert of Arbroath 244 High Street, Arbroath, Angus (01241 873 522); also at 3 High Street, Kirriemuir (01575 574 483) Producer of whole hot-smoked haddock, better known as Arbroath Smokies. The small fish, bought daily from Aberdeen market 50 miles away, are split open and cleaned but not filleted, before being salted for about two hours. After the salt is washed off, the fish are tied together in pairs and hung up to dry, then smoked and cooked in a concrete-lined pit over whole pieces of oak or beech. It takes only 30 to 40 minutes, each fish being removed when it is ready. Supplies at the moment are 'desperate', as the fish are just recovering from spawning - prices therefore are liable to fluctuation. Specialists Cornish Fish Direct The Pilchard Works, Tolcarne, Newlyn, Penzance, Cornwall (01736 332 112; www.cornishfish.com) If you think pilchards and sardines only come in tins, take the kids along to The Pilchard Works, a working museum open every day from Easter to October. A pilchard is an adult sardine, and Nick Howell sells them fresh - line caught from day boats and filleted - at around \u00a32 to \u00a32.20 per kg. Fish landed Thursday morning are sent out the same day, to be with you by Friday morning (orders over \u00a340 carriage free). He also salts larger fillets for three months, and puts them in oil (\u00a32.80 for a 200g jar): try them as a meatier and more satisfying alternative to anchovy. James Baxter &amp; Son Thornton Road, Morecambe, Lancashire (01524 410 910) Potted brown shrimps are a great delight, not least because all the hard work is done for you, and the butter is a bonus. Boiled in sea water, shelled and potted, they are made to the same recipe that has been in the Baxter family (now in its sixth generation in the business) since the 19th century. Sold in 2oz (57g) and 7oz (200g) cartons, plus a new 3.5oz (100g) version. Price depends on size of order (eg, 20 x 2oz cartons cost \u00a362 including carriage). RE Campbell 72 Maltings Road, Bagley's Lane, London SW6 (020 7371 5566) Father Bob Campbell and son Robin trade in impeccably sourced Iranian caviar from the Caspian Sea. Thanks to Russian mafiosi and contraband Iranian dealers, there is a lot of suspect caviar about, but theirs comes with a CITES certificate from a licensed trading corporation in Iran, with every tin sealed and numbered at source. Beluga (pale grey to black) 'really does taste best' and costs \u00a3275 for 250g (\u00a355 for 50g); Oscietre (smaller, pale brown eggs) is \u00a3175 (\u00a340 for 50g); Sevruga (smaller still, dark grey) is \u00a3135 (\u00a327 for 50g). Store between 0 and -2 C for up to 14 days, eat within 24 hours of opening, and use a non-metallic spoon (plastic, horn, wood or mother of pearl). Caviar House 161 Piccadilly, London W1 (020 7409 7171) A combination of restaurant, seafood bar and take-away, this Copenhagen-based family company, founded in 1950, also has airport shops at Heathrow and Gatwick. Eggs from Beluga, the largest and rarest sturgeon, cost \u00a3740 for 250g (\u00a3160 for 50g); Oscietre is \u00a3285 (\u00a360 for 50g); and Sevruga, which accounts for 70 per cent of the total catch, is \u00a3246 (\u00a353 for 50g). They also sell Royal Black (from 40-year-old Oscietre sturgeon) and Imperial (from 80-year-old Oscietre). Pembrokeshire Meat &amp; Fish 21 St Govans Centre, Pembroke Dock, Pembrokeshire (01646 685 747) As stocks of wild sea trout decline, so the incentive to farm them becomes more attractive, if only to relieve pressure on the wild. They are a delicacy - a brown trout that runs away to sea and ends up halfway to being a salmon - known in Wales as sewin. Stephen Thomson of Haven Harvest oversees their progression from 100g freshwater tiddlers to adults weighing anything from 1.5 to 4 or 5lb, transferring them to seawater after about a year. Milford Haven had a rough time a few years ago when the Sea Empress ran aground, but this is now a Special Area of Conservation, with low-density stocking, no chemical treatments, and a strong current to put some muscle on the fish. He supplies several outlets, but Pembrokeshire Meat &amp; Fish can get hold of them quickly (telephone first), and sells them at \u00a34 per lb. Fish and chips When it comes to fish and chips, forget day boats that potter round the coast. This is big business, and the white fish is typically 'frozen at sea' in factory ships within a few hours of being hauled into the boat. Although they are a national institution, fish and chip shops vary considerably in quality, depending on the skill and care of the owner. Olley's Fish Experience 67 Norwood Road, London SE24 (020 8671 8259) As the name suggests, this is no ordinary chippie. Order from curved, gold-rimmed blackboards, and be prepared for some of the best fish and chips in London, if not the country: cod, haddock, hake, salmon, monk, halibut and skate are all battered and deep-fried to order. Harry Niazi is fanatical, keeping his freshly prepared batter at 1 to 3 C, so it forms a proper seal when it hits the 180 C groundnut oil. Chips are blanched first (it makes a big difference) and cooked at 170 C until crisp. Mushy peas are home-made; 'no curry sauce'. Take away or eat in. Park Chippy Station Road, Suffield Park, Cromer, Norfolk (01263 513 050) Dave Audley is happy with 'frozen at sea' fish because it is filleted, cleaned, processed and frozen within three hours of being caught; his range includes huss, plaice, skate wing, haddock and cod in five sizes, from children's to a 14oz whopper. He uses beef dripping for fying ('It gives a better flavour'), and never lets a piece of fish anywhere near the fat until it has been ordered and paid for: nothing is worse than fried fish that has to hang around waiting for a customer to stroll in. Chips are soaked in a solution that allows them to dry quickly, thus producing a better chip, which also stops them absorbing too much fat. Only take away, but there are queues at peak times. Bizzie Lizzie's 36 Swadford Street, Skipton, North Yorkshire (01756 793 189) Last year's winner of the Best Fish &amp; Chip Shop in the Country, Jean Ritson is another devotee of 'frozen at sea' white fish, because it is 'the best you can get'. The defrosted cod and haddock are portioned, and pin bones removed, before being dunked in batter that is made fresh three or four times a day. Chunky chips are blanched in cooler dripping first and allowed to rest before being crisped off in baskets when needed; that way there is always a good supply ready when coach parties turn up, but nothing spoiling if things are quiet. Cod, chips and peas to take away cost \u00a32.80, and there is a restaurant as well. Other recommended fish and chip shops Henry Higgins 47 Station Road, Woburn Sands, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire (01908 583 144) Belfield's 72 Parliament Street, Burnley, Lancashire (01282 428 042) Fish'n' Chick'n 9 The Mall, Bar Hill, Cambridge (01954 781 627) Hanbury's Licensed Fish Restaurant Princes Street, Torquay, Devon (01803 329 928) P &amp; M Fionda 231 Low Waters Road, Hamilton, Strathclyde (01698 281 877) Croesy Fish Bar 7 Edlogan Square, Croes-y-Ceiliog, Cwmbran, Gwent (01633 860 033) Brady's 513 Old York Road, London SW18 (020 8877 9599) Two Brothers Fish Restaurant 297 Regent's Park Road, London N3 (020 8346 0469) Upper Street Fish Shop 324 Upper Street, London N1 (020 7359 1401) Shellfish Live shellfish are available for those who enjoy preparing them personally, and ready cooked for those who prefer the easy route. The chances of finding a bad oyster these days are slim in view of the rigorous purification process they have to undergo. Mussels are available now, but autumn and winter are the best seasons. Menai Oysters Tal-y-Bont Bach, Dwyran, Anglesey (01248 430 878) Sean Krijnen trained as a marine biologist, specialising in shellfish for his MSc, and took over this business on the south-west corner of Anglesey eight years ago. He grows Pacific oysters from seed (natives don't like the conditions here) and it takes about three years for them to reach maturity and a saleable size of 90g to 120g. Mail-order deliveries are despatched at 4.30pm the day before to arrive Tuesday to Friday: \u00a314 for one dozen; \u00a318 for two; \u00a322 for three, etc, or \u00a340 for 100 oysters (prices include carriage). Fish on the Quay Cadwgan Place, Aberaeron (01545 571 294) Peter Bottoms reckons to 'shift more shellfish than anyone else in west Wales', specialising in crab, lobsters and prawns from the Bay (buy them live, or still warm from the pot), plus anything from local day boats. He is also part of the Cardigan Bay Fishermen's Association that takes conservation seriously, returning egg-laden hen lobsters to the sea, with the help of a small EU grant, to ensure the viability of future generations of both lobsters and fishermen. Alternatively, eat seafood salads, chowder and fresh mackerel across the courtyard at Hive on the Quay (01545 570 445, open daytime only, seven days a week, until September) which Peter Bottoms supplies. Note also the Cardigan Bay Fish Festival in Aberaeron Harbour on 9 July, with everything from sea shanties to chef demonstrations. Mail order Far from being second best, mail order is often the preferred way to buy spankingly fresh fish, cutting out the middleman. Typically landed from day boats, it can be on its way to you within a few hours. The cost of transport (which can be shared with friends) is easily compensated for by the high quality. While some of the previous entries offer mail-order delivery, the following are specialists. Quayside Fish The Harbourside, Porthleven, Cornwall (01326 562 008) John Strike's fish comes from day boats, sold direct at the harbourside and by mail order at \u00a38.50 per delivery: refrigerated orders leave by 4pm, and arrive before noon next day. It will supply whatever is in season - take the advice about best buys (currently plaice and turbot) with confidence - and will send it as whole fish, fillets, or whatever you require. Live lobsters are \u00a315.90 per kg, and crabmeat is second to none: white (usually from big-clawed cock crabs) is \u00a323.95 per kg, but brown (typically from a hen crab) is \u00a39.70 per kg and is an underrated joy - make it into soup or spread it on sandwiches. It also smokes its own fish, from large haddock via smoked salmon to popular hot roast-smoked salmon. Club Chef Direct Lakeside, Bridgewater Road, Barrow Gurney, Bristol (01793 433 733; www.clubchefdirect.co.uk) Top restaurants always seem to get magnificent supplies - enormous scallops in the shell, razor clams, live lobster, skate wings, wild sea bass and sea trout - that are far better than anything you ever see in a shop. Together with Steve Downey of Heritage Fine Foods, a few of them (Rick Stein, Shaun Hill, Pierre Koffmann, Franco Taruschio, Philip Howard, Richard Corrigan and others) have formed a group to supply ordinary retail customers with exactly the prime-quality produce they use themselves. Subscription to the club costs \u00a3100 pa (other supplies include meat, poultry, offal, mushrooms, game and more), and while Steve Downey organises supplies - guaranteed next-day delivery for members, typically at prices below high-street retailers - the chefs will contribute recipes to a monthly magazine (for June, Sally Clarke on crab and Michel Roux Jr on red mullet). Non members can contact Heritage Fine Foods (01275 474 707) for similar supplies without the bells and whistles. Loch Fyne Oysters Clachan, Cairndow, Argyll (01499 600 264; www.loch-fyne.com) Pacific oysters are grown from seed in the loch, packed in wooden panniers, and cost \u00a39 per dozen by overnight delivery (\u00a35 carriage for orders under \u00a360). Smoked salmon is among the very best, sourced from Loch Duart, with sustainability a central aim: 'We do not smoke wild salmon, which is now effectively an endangered species.' An unsliced side (the best way to buy it) weighing around 1kg costs \u00a321, while the luxurious Kinglas fillet is \u00a318.50 for approximately 500g. There are lots of other lines, from gravlax to langoustines and smoked cod's roe, and personal callers can eat in the adjoining oyster bar. Branches in Nottingham, Cambridge, Elton (near Peterborough), Twickenham and Barnet. River Exe Shellfish Farms Lyson, Kenton, Exeter, Devon (01626 890 133; David@resf.freeserve.co.uk) Pacific oysters are grown in the estuary of the River Exe, and sold at the farm gate, oyster bars in county shows, events such as Henley, and by mail order. Nigel Smith reckons that conditions in the Exe produce a creamier oyster than those from the east coast at Colchester or Whitstable, an effect enhanced by draining off the first water after opening and resting them for 10 minutes. Small to medium-sized oysters are delivered packed in seaweed Tuesday to Friday, within 24 hours of the order: \u00a316 for a dozen, up to \u00a352 for 10 dozen (prices include delivery). They can also be eaten with Marston's bottle-conditioned oyster stout at sister company Abbotsbury Oysters Ferrybridge, Weymouth, Dorset (01305 788 867). Marchents PO Box 100, Fareham, PO14 2SX; (0870 900 2900; www.marchents.com) This company brings together small and medium-sized producers of meat, vegetables, cheese, cakes, preserves and more, and sells via the internet. Fish comes from Matthew Stevens of St Ives, and includes ready-to-cook fillets of brill, John Dory, monk and plaice, all sourced locally, plus whole lemon and Dover soles. Also sells smoked fish, shellfish and caviar. Wing of St Mawes 4 Warren Road, Indian Queens, St Columb, Cornwall (01726 861 666; www.cornish-seafood.co.uk).

      "body": "<p>Fish and chips present the most cogent argument there is against the myth of food combining: protein and carbohydrate together, as they were meant to be until recent faddish revelation. By this, I don't just mean that I like, we like, eating them together - though that could scarcely be beside the point - but that these pairings, bread and cheese and steak frites, no less than fish and chips, have an integrity that defies any passing gobbledygook.</p> <p>But who am I kidding? My interest in these matters is not as an alternative health critic but as a voluptuary. I'm after pleasure, not nutritional confirmation. But should you be concerned about such matters as fat intake, you should know that deep-frying is a relatively innocent occupation. The extreme heat in which you deep-fry immediately seals whatever is being fried, so the foodstuff's actual fat uptake is curtailed. And it is this sudden, succulence-ensuring sealing that makes deep-frying the culinary miracle it is. No doubt you find it, as a method, slightly d\u00e9class\u00e9, but bite into a piece of fish that's been dipped in pale batter and then into bubbling oil and you will taste a textural contrast - crisp carapace, tender flesh that's been steamed to milky softness within - that the great names of the old nouvelle cuisine could only dream of.</p> <p>Do I sound embarrassingly enthusiastic? Well, I am a convert. I don't mean that I've only just eaten fish and chips for the first time (that not by a long chalk), but I have only just cooked fish and chips for the first time. I thought it was the sort of food no one in their right mind cooked at home, and I don't say that only because I live next door but one to a chippy. But now I know I was wrong. How I was wrong.</p> <p>The novice fryer, though, cannot do it all alone. I thought I'd do it the traditional, unpretentious way: a big old pan, filled with oil spluttering dangerously, excitingly, and a basket for dipping and retrieving. But since I know that the temperature of the oil is crucial and since I also know that I am not someone who should be anywhere near a food thermometer, let alone dipping it in boiling oil, I decided to keep the stabilisers on. I borrowed a Magimix deep-fat fryer (much more inviting, and more aesthetically appealing, than those fearful ones with plastic coated instant-seal lids), bought embarrassing amounts of oil, amounts I haven't used in my whole life thus far, and got frying. The joy! It's my favourite new toy.</p> <p>In many ways, making fish and chips is more ritual than cooking: think of it as an Anglo version of the Japanese tea ceremony. Actually, a propos of that, the Anglo-element is itself debatable. Fish and chips, as we all know, is traditional British feed; along with the roast beef Olde England, it's what John Bull tucks into. But how British is British? Fried fish in batter found its way into the culinary canon by dint of the street stalls of the Portuguese Marrano Jews who'd come here in the 16th century. When chips were first paired with this fried fish (which would have been eaten cold by the Jewish population) is not clear, but Claudia Roden cites Malin's, a fish and chip shop in Bow (established 1860), which in 1968 was awarded a commemorative plaque to mark the place as the oldest enterprise selling fish and chips together in Britain. She explains the conjunction as a loose union, if only culinary, between Eastern European and Irish immigrants, in the main, along with some longer-established Sephardic families.</p> <p>The proper accompaniment to fish and chips is meant to be mushy peas (and you all will probably have heard that apocryphal story, attributed, no doubt unfairly, to Peter Mandelson, which has him in a chippy up north exclaiming enthusiastically, 'Lovely - and I'll have some of that guacamole to go with'). I, being a southerner, choose otherwise. Chips, when eaten alone, need only salt and vinegar, though sometimes brown sauce is desirable; fish and chips proper need pickled eggs and gherkins, real crocodile-skinned, juicy-crisp, pickled cucumbers.</p> <p><b> The fish</b></p> <p>I think it's a choice between cod or skate. The problem with skate is definitely the bones, though it is a fish that fries beautifully. But cod is really the fish people mean when they talk about fish and chips. You want fillets with the skin on (this helps keep the fish firmly in one piece), and I should reckon on a 150g-200g piece per person; obviously less for children. The batter is important, though, for the frying temperature of the oil is the most crucial factor. And since the fish needs to be fried at the same temperature as the second-dunking of the chips, I suggest you give the chips their first immersion (see below) then turn up the heat to fry the fish before giving the chips their final searing. If you're worried that the fish taste will permeate the chips (it shouldn't: just don't keep reusing the same old oil for too long), do the chips fully before the fish.</p> <p>I like beer batter, though you could just as easily use water (as I do when making fish and chips for the children's tea; I've had the deep-fryer for a scant week and already I've been wholly, addictively familiarised), and it is ridiculously easy to make: you simply stir the liquid into the flour to blend. I find one of those little things often called a Magiwhisk (think of a contraption rather like a tinny handle with, instead of a spoon at the end, the outline of a spoon wearing a wire beard) the best way to get rid of lumps. The batter should be thinner than a cake batter but thicker than pancake batter. You need to feel confident it's not just going to drip off. So pour the liquid into the flour slowly - and if you sprinkle the fish with a little flour before dunking it into the batter, it will adhere better.</p> <p>The amount of batter makes enough to coat two decent-sized pieces of fish.

If it's a beer batter, add salt now.</p> <p>Dust some flour over the fish fillets, or just dredge them on a plate you've already sprinkled with flour. Dip them into the batter, making sure they're well covered (but don't get too neurotic about it dripping off: that can't be totally avoided) and then, piece by piece, drop them into the hot oil.

If you've never read Jeffrey Steingarten's essay on finding the perfect chip in The Man Who Ate Everything (Vintage Books, \u00a314), then you must.

But anyway, these electric deep-fat fryers warn against the use of solid fats - a pity, as I remember some wonderful chips fried in lard in Dublin (where Stephen Bloom also ate his). The two rules for chips are simply: use good potatoes (preferably Maris Piper), and cook them twice. You cook them first at a lower temperature in order to make sure they're cooked within; the second immersion at a higher temperature is to crisp them up.

      "bodyText": "Fish and chips present the most cogent argument there is against the myth of food combining: protein and carbohydrate together, as they were meant to be until recent faddish revelation. By this, I don't just mean that I like, we like, eating them together - though that could scarcely be beside the point - but that these pairings, bread and cheese and steak frites, no less than fish and chips, have an integrity that defies any passing gobbledygook. But who am I kidding? My interest in these matters is not as an alternative health critic but as a voluptuary. I'm after pleasure, not nutritional confirmation. But should you be concerned about such matters as fat intake, you should know that deep-frying is a relatively innocent occupation. The extreme heat in which you deep-fry immediately seals whatever is being fried, so the foodstuff's actual fat uptake is curtailed. And it is this sudden, succulence-ensuring sealing that makes deep-frying the culinary miracle it is. No doubt you find it, as a method, slightly d\u00e9class\u00e9, but bite into a piece of fish that's been dipped in pale batter and then into bubbling oil and you will taste a textural contrast - crisp carapace, tender flesh that's been steamed to milky softness within - that the great names of the old nouvelle cuisine could only dream of. Do I sound embarrassingly enthusiastic? Well, I am a convert. I don't mean that I've only just eaten fish and chips for the first time (that not by a long chalk), but I have only just cooked fish and chips for the first time. I thought it was the sort of food no one in their right mind cooked at home, and I don't say that only because I live next door but one to a chippy. But now I know I was wrong. How I was wrong. The novice fryer, though, cannot do it all alone. I thought I'd do it the traditional, unpretentious way: a big old pan, filled with oil spluttering dangerously, excitingly, and a basket for dipping and retrieving. But since I know that the temperature of the oil is crucial and since I also know that I am not someone who should be anywhere near a food thermometer, let alone dipping it in boiling oil, I decided to keep the stabilisers on. I borrowed a Magimix deep-fat fryer (much more inviting, and more aesthetically appealing, than those fearful ones with plastic coated instant-seal lids), bought embarrassing amounts of oil, amounts I haven't used in my whole life thus far, and got frying. The joy! It's my favourite new toy. In many ways, making fish and chips is more ritual than cooking: think of it as an Anglo version of the Japanese tea ceremony. Actually, a propos of that, the Anglo-element is itself debatable. Fish and chips, as we all know, is traditional British feed; along with the roast beef Olde England, it's what John Bull tucks into. But how British is British? Fried fish in batter found its way into the culinary canon by dint of the street stalls of the Portuguese Marrano Jews who'd come here in the 16th century. When chips were first paired with this fried fish (which would have been eaten cold by the Jewish population) is not clear, but Claudia Roden cites Malin's, a fish and chip shop in Bow (established 1860), which in 1968 was awarded a commemorative plaque to mark the place as the oldest enterprise selling fish and chips together in Britain. She explains the conjunction as a loose union, if only culinary, between Eastern European and Irish immigrants, in the main, along with some longer-established Sephardic families. The proper accompaniment to fish and chips is meant to be mushy peas (and you all will probably have heard that apocryphal story, attributed, no doubt unfairly, to Peter Mandelson, which has him in a chippy up north exclaiming enthusiastically, 'Lovely - and I'll have some of that guacamole to go with'). I, being a southerner, choose otherwise. Chips, when eaten alone, need only salt and vinegar, though sometimes brown sauce is desirable; fish and chips proper need pickled eggs and gherkins, real crocodile-skinned, juicy-crisp, pickled cucumbers. The fish I think it's a choice between cod or skate. The problem with skate is definitely the bones, though it is a fish that fries beautifully. But cod is really the fish people mean when they talk about fish and chips. You want fillets with the skin on (this helps keep the fish firmly in one piece), and I should reckon on a 150g-200g piece per person; obviously less for children. The batter is important, though, for the frying temperature of the oil is the most crucial factor. And since the fish needs to be fried at the same temperature as the second-dunking of the chips, I suggest you give the chips their first immersion (see below) then turn up the heat to fry the fish before giving the chips their final searing. If you're worried that the fish taste will permeate the chips (it shouldn't: just don't keep reusing the same old oil for too long), do the chips fully before the fish. I like beer batter, though you could just as easily use water (as I do when making fish and chips for the children's tea; I've had the deep-fryer for a scant week and already I've been wholly, addictively familiarised), and it is ridiculously easy to make: you simply stir the liquid into the flour to blend. I find one of those little things often called a Magiwhisk (think of a contraption rather like a tinny handle with, instead of a spoon at the end, the outline of a spoon wearing a wire beard) the best way to get rid of lumps. The batter should be thinner than a cake batter but thicker than pancake batter. You need to feel confident it's not just going to drip off. So pour the liquid into the flour slowly - and if you sprinkle the fish with a little flour before dunking it into the batter, it will adhere better. The amount of batter makes enough to coat two decent-sized pieces of fish. I would think beer batter is meant to be made with bitter, or was traditionally, but I use whatever lager I've got in the fridge. 400g cod fillets, skin on tsp salt 100g self-raising flour, plus more for dusting and dredging 150ml lager (about half a small bottle) or water Heat the oil to 190 C and have the basket in the fryer, waiting. If using water, dissolve the salt into it. Pour the beer (or salted water) into the flour in a bowl, whisking as you do so till you've got a creamily thick and smooth batter. If it's a beer batter, add salt now. Dust some flour over the fish fillets, or just dredge them on a plate you've already sprinkled with flour. Dip them into the batter, making sure they're well covered (but don't get too neurotic about it dripping off: that can't be totally avoided) and then, piece by piece, drop them into the hot oil.

Once the fish is in and has had 30 seconds or so, get a chopstick or two (that's what I like to use) and turn it.

      "body": "<p>Some years ago, when I was writing recipes for a magazine, my editor advised me that its readers preferred to cook salmon, prawns and chicken. It seemed a bit limited. Had life become so sterile that it was considered dangerous to cook a glistening whole mackerel, with its saline scent and provocative bones?</p> <p>I need not have worried - it seems that our piscine timidity is fast disappearing. Where once my local fishmonger displayed plaice and trout, he now arranges fantastical farmed sturgeon and monstrous-headed monkfish. Chefs are slowly but surely persuading us to cook everything from spiced sea bass to scallop sashimi.</p> <p>Adrian Rudolf, owner of Fish &amp; Fowl in Parliament Hill, north London (020 7284 4184) explains: 'If someone like Rick Stein or Jamie Oliver has been on telly and used fillets of dorade, you will be inundated with requests for them the next day.'</p> <p>Vanessa Strike, joint owner of The Quayside Fish Centre in Porthleven, Cornwall (see Directory, page 53), agrees. She used to mainly sell cod, haddock and plaice; now, after countless chef programmes, her customers want sea bass, John Dory, red mullet and brill.</p> <p>She believes that such programmes, combined with more travelling and eating out, have opened people's eyes to the pleasures of fish. 'It's not unusual these days for someone to ask us for pomfret or red snapper,' she says. 'We've even had requests for zebra fish. Apparently, it is very nice.' Shrinking home stocks, however, have also led to unfamiliar fish appearing in the markets. 'If the weather is bad and the fish is scarce,' explains Vanessa, 'you can't afford to have a bare fish counter, so you have to buy in exotics like swordfish or marlin.'</p> <p>As a supplier to both the restaurant trade and the public, Adrian Rudolf has also experienced the rising popularity of fish first-hand. 'In a few years,' he says, 'chefs have doubled the number of fish dishes on their menus, and where they once used one fishmonger, they now buy from three or four.' Consequently, many suppliers have had to specialise in one or two fish, such as tuna or wild salmon. Most are now expected to fillet and portion the fish before delivery, and you should never be afraid to ask your fishmonger to do this for you.</p> <p>Curiously, the chefs themselves modestly attribute their customers' increased appetite for fish to a growing awareness of healthy eating. Some, such as Richard Corrigan, suspect that anxiety over farming practices has led to this trend. In reality, many chefs are proactive in shaping their customers' tastes. Germain Schwab, chef/proprietor of Winteringham Fields in North Lincolnshire, is a classic example. 'When we first opened in 1989,' he recalls, 'nobody ate much fish here. I decided to give them a tiny fish appetiser to try and tempt them.' Then they started to order them when he transferred them on to the menu.</p> <p>It is never easy to predict where such fashions will lead. Perhaps a glance at restaurant menus reveals the future. It seems to lie with simply cooked, filleted fish, such as pan-fried char with samphire, or sea bream with tapenade and balsamic vinaigrette. A far cry from processed prawns and flabby farmed salmon.</p> <p><b> Vineet Bhatia of Zaika</b></p> <p>No fish is safe from Vineet Bhatia, head chef of Zaika, in west London. Every ingredient that enters his kitchen is analysed for its role in creating a subtly spiced, modern Indian dish. If he is presented with a Black Scabbard and finds that its gelatinous, pearly white flesh makes wonderful sweet dumplings, then he will serve them wrapped in gold leaf and floating in a creamy cardamom sauce.</p> <p>Vineet Bhatia specialised in Indian cooking at the prestigious Oberoi Hotel School of Management in New Delhi. His fascination has led him to develop a lighter style of cooking which combines traditional Indian spices with non-Indian flavourings, such as lime leaves, lemon grass and honey. He then combines regional techniques to create a new style of cooking. Thus his recipe for spicy sea bass with Indian couscous fries the fish Bengali style and serves it with a typical Punjabi sauce and an unusually spiced south Indian semolina base.</p> <p>These days, he thinks nothing of making a firm-fleshed halibut biryani or of gently poaching scallops in a delicious chilli and lemon-grass coconut sauce. All of which might sound a little dubious to those who like their poppadoms plain, but one bite of his scallops with their accompanying whipped masala mashed potato and you may find that your local take-away has lost its charm.</p> <p>Zaika, 257-259 Fulham Road, London SW3 (020 7351 7823)</p> <p><b> Spicy sea bass with Indian couscous</b></p> <p>Some supermarkets sell gram flour, green mangoes and coarse semolina, but you can find them, along with fresh curry leaves, in Asian shops.

Refrigerate for 30 minutes.</p> <p>Next, make the sauce by mixing together the yogurt, gram flour, turmeric, salt and 300ml water. Heat the oil in a saucepan, add the cumin seeds, ginger, green chilli, the whole red chilli, curry leaves and asafoetida in quick succession. As it splutters, add the yogurt mixture, bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 8 minutes, stirring continuously to prevent lumps forming. Strain the sauce, add more water if necessary to ensure that it has a creamy consistency, and check the seasoning. Set aside while you prepare the upma.</p> <p>Place 15ml oil in a deep saucepan with the butter. Set over a medium heat and stir in the mustard seeds. As they crackle, add the ginger, green chilli and curry leaves. Then lower the heat and add the semolina. Dry roast for 5-6 minutes until it releases a nutty aroma. Stir in 240ml warm water and the coconut milk. Increase the heat and add the lemon juice, a pinch of salt and sugar. Cook for a further 3 minutes.</p> <p>Finally, cook the fish over a medium-high heat, skin-side down in a non-stick frying pan. Once it is half cooked, with crisp skin, turn it over and cook for a further minute. Then rest for a few minutes while you reheat the sauce. Once it's hot, mix 1 tbsps chopped coriander leaves into the sauce and 2 tbsps chopped coriander to the upma.</p> <p>Spoon the upma into the centre of 4 soup-bowl plates. Pour the sauce around it and place the pan-fried sea bass on top of the upma. Garnish with raw mango matchsticks, if you wish.</p> <p><b> Mark Edwards of Nobu</b></p> <p>Unlike many well-known chefs, Mark Edwards, head chef at London's \u00fcbercool, Michelin-starred Nobu in Mayfair, admits that he didn't begin his career with a burning desire to cook. Instead he wanted to travel. Unwittingly, this enabled him to discover his true vocation: cooking Asian-inspired food. In 1987, he was working at The Rainbow Room in New York. 'England was still in the grip of cream and butter,' he recalls, 'and I was suddenly being given chillies, lemon grass and ginger. I loved it, and decided that I had to learn more.' He arranged to work in Singapore, followed by Hong Kong, before slowly travelling home via south-east Asia. He arrived in London in 1994 in time for what he calls the 'Asian revolution' and a job at Vong, where French meets Thai in Knightsbridge.</p> <p>Nobuyuki Matsuhisa (aka Nobu) head-hunted him to open his eponymous restaurant.

One bite, and you understand why this is superlative food.</p> <p>Nobu, 19 Old Park Lane, London W1 (020 7447 4747)</p> <p><b> Seared scallop and sweet shrimp sashimi</b></p> <p>Squeamish cooks might prefer to ask their fishmonger to open and clean their scallops - in which case, make sure you get them to save the skirts. Never use frozen scallops for this recipe - they should always be fresh. If you're buying fresh out of the shell, always check that they are very fresh indeed. You can, however, use frozen raw shrimp, as does Mark Edwards.</p> <p>You will have more soy sauce mixed with lemon juice, and olive oil mixed with sesame oil, than you will need, but Mark Edwards says that it only mixes properly in this quantity. An excuse to make some more.

If a black line runs down their backs (their digestive cord), gently pull away and clean.</p> <p>Open the scallops with a table knife and remove them from their shells, taking care to keep them whole. Gently remove the skirt - which looks like a piece of elastic - from the white muscle before discarding the white muscle. (If you have bought shelled scallops, they will not have the skirt, but you will still need to discard the white muscle.)</p> <p>Soak the skirts in salted water and scrub to remove any sand. Rub the large end of a chopstick along the length of the skirt on a flat surface to remove any sand from inside the skirt.</p> <p>Wash and pat dry the scallops, then, using a very sharp knife, slice them into as many thin, whole, round slices as possible. It is important to cut each slice in one movement - slicing towards yourself. If you use a sawing movement the scallop will break up.</p> <p>Arrange the shrimp, scallop slices and skirt flat on a serving dish. Rub with the garlic pur\u00e9e.</p> <p>Sprinkle the shredded ginger and sliced chives evenly over the top of the dish, before seasoning to taste with the black pepper, soy sauce and lemon mixture, balsamic vinegar and the toasted sesame seeds.</p> <p>Heat the olive oil and sesame oil mixture until it is smoking, and drizzle a little over the top of the dish to sear the shellfish and activate all the flavours. Serve immediately.</p> <p><b> Richard Corrigan of Lindsay House</b></p> <p>A dainty dish of wild salmon is not quite what one associates with Richard Corrigan, the bluff Irish chef of Lindsay House, in Soho. Hearty plates of pigs' trotters and black pudding, yes - but red mullet, sea bream and lobster, no. Such stereotyping clearly upset Corrigan, as he explains: 'I always serve fish in the summer,' he says. 'I only have two meat dishes on at the moment, just as in winter I usually only offer two fish dishes. This is a commercial restaurant - I serve people what they want to eat.'</p> <p>Having grown up on a farm in County Meath, one of seven children, he developed a taste for freshwater fish when young. His father was an expert poacher and extended the family diet by netting wild salmon for breakfast and keeping eels in the river in a big washtub punctured with holes. 'To see a 12lb wild salmon being shared out by the men to feed several families is a beautiful thing,' says Corrigan. 'When it is really fresh, it smells of fresh grass.' As a child he would catch young pike with a lump of meat. 'My mother would bake it with bay leaves, butter and seasoning and serve it for supper with a pool of salty butter and a salad.'</p> <p>His cooking may have become more sophisticated, but clearly his taste has been shaped by his past. His wild salmon is still liberally seasoned and served with a butter sauce, albeit flavoured with fennel and brown shrimp.</p> <p>Lindsay House, 21 Romilly Street, London W1 (020 7439 0450)</p> <p><b> Wild salmon, salsify and brown shrimp with fennel emulsion</b></p> <p>The following recipe can be adapted by replacing the salsify with asparagus, in which case allow 4 tips per person and cook in boiling water until tender. Salsify can sometimes be found in specialist greengrocers and organic shops. Lardo is the fat from Parma ham; you can also use the fatty part of Parma ham slices. Serves 4.</p> <p>4 wild salmon steaks (about 150g each) cut from</p> <p>the centre, about 2cm thick, central bone and</p> <p>skin removed</p> <p>4 strips lardo (see above)</p> <p>sunflower oil</p> <p><b> for the salsify</b></p> <p>juice of lemon</p> <p>8 sticks salsify</p> <p>1-2 garlic cloves, peeled</p> <p>fresh bouquet garni of thyme and bay leaf</p> <p>30g unsalted butter</p> <p>80g peeled brown shrimp (to be added right at</p> <p>the end)</p> <p><b> for the fennel emulsion</b></p> <p>unsalted butter</p> <p>bulb fennel, chopped, reserve the feathery</p> <p>part or use 2 tbsps finely chopped fennel</p> <p>herb leaves</p> <p>1 garlic clove, chopped</p> <p>1 shallot, chopped</p> <p>150ml vegetable stock</p> <p>6 tbsps double cream</p> <p>salt and freshly ground black pepper</p> <p>Be sure all the bones have been removed from the salmon steaks. Wrap a strip of lardo around the outside of each steak, just as you would wrap a tournedos in fat, and tie it on with string. Set aside in the fridge.</p> <p>To prepare the salsify, half fill a deep saucepan with water and add the lemon juice. Trim and peel the salsify, then cut in half, dropping each stick into the acidulated water as it is prepared (to prevent discolouration). When all the salsify is in the pan, add the garlic and bouquet garni and bring to the boil. Simmer for 5-6 minutes, or until the salsify is just tender, but still quite firm. Remove from the heat and leave to cool in the liquid. When cool enough to handle, drain and cut into matchsticks 13-15cm long. Set aside. If using asparagus, keep the tips whole.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 230 C/gas mark 8. To make the fennel emulsion, melt a knob of butter in a saucepan, add the fennel (but not the feathery bits), garlic and shallot, and sweat gently until very soft. Pour in the stock and bring to the boil. Add the cream and stir, then simmer for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Pur\u00e9e the mixture in a blender or food processor, then press it though a sieve into a clean pan. Add the chopped feathery part of the fennel (or chopped herb fennel) and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</p> <p>To cook the salmon, put a film of sunflower oil in a cast-iron frying pan that has an ovenproof handle and set over a medium heat. Season the salmon steaks. When the oil is hot, put the salmon steaks in the pan and sear for about 30 seconds on each side. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook for about 5 minutes (the salmon will be medium rare).</p> <p>To finish the salsify or asparagus, melt the butter in a frying pan and toss with the shrimp to reheat. Season to taste. Reheat the fennel emulsion, if necessary.</p> <p>To serve, pile the salsify in the centre of each warmed plate and set a salmon steak on top. Spoon the fennel emulsion around. Serve immediately.</p> <p><b> Georgio Locatelli of Zafferano</b></p> <p>Georgio Locatelli wanted to give his recipe for breadcrumbed eel for this article. 'It's delicious,' he urged. 'You just have to throw it on to the embers of a dying barbecue, and in 20 minutes you can eat it. You bite through the crisp crust and it melts in your mouth.' 'But Georgio,' I protested, 'how do you prepare the eel?'</p> <p>'Ah well,' he replied. 'You do have to kill it, then hang it over a sink and skin it.' He paused, then added, 'It's not very nice, even when you have a special implement to dispatch it quickly.' Tasty though his dish sounded, we agreed that perhaps it would be better to settle for his gilt-headed sea bream (orata) instead, something you can buy ready-filleted from the fishmonger.</p> <p>In true Italian manner, Locatelli is generous and enthusiastic about all his cooking. Born in a Michelin-starred restaurant in Corgenno, near the lakes in northern Italy, he found his place in the kitchen at the age of five. 'Freshwater fish is really underrated here in Britain,' he remarks. 'Perch, pike and eel are completely overshadowed by farmed salmon.'</p> <p>Nevertheless, he clearly manages to console himself by serving other delicacies such as small, breadcrumbed red mullet, pancetta-wrapped monkfish with samphire, char-grilled calamari with tomato and, of course, orata with spinach, balsamic vinaigrette and a piquant sesame radish garnish. His food is labelled as modern Italian.

Living in the depths of rural North Lincolnshire, he utilises everything around him to create exquisite seasonal food. The first whiff of lime blossom on the summer air and it is picked and transformed into a piquant sauce for brill. As soon as the first summer morels begin to appear nearby, he will gather them up as an accompaniment to turbot, stuffed with a tiny spoonful of turbot mousse.</p> <p>Schwab's philosophy is simple. 'I try to be inventive with local produce,' he says, forgetting to add that as a result he has been awarded two Michelin stars and a '9' in The Good Food Guide . Nearly half of his menu uses fish, much of it from British rivers and lakes - perhaps as a result of his having been born in the landlocked Jura. 'My fishmonger in Grimsby buys me freshwater char (omble-chevalier) from Wiltshire,' he states. 'It doesn't get the recognition here it deserves, but I have always loved it.' He frequently partners it with succulent English samphire, which has just come into season on the salt marshes.</p> <p>Everything Schwab buys has to be gleaming fresh. 'With fish, you need to look for sparkling eyes, bright red gills and a lovely colour. Char or wild salmon should literally look vivid,' he says. Then it is a question of creating a harmonious dish with home-grown ingredients like lovage, English mace ( Achillea decoloras ) and basil. Summer on a plate, you might say.</p> <p>Winteringham Fields, Winteringham, North Lincolnshire (01724 733 096).

      "bodyText": "Some years ago, when I was writing recipes for a magazine, my editor advised me that its readers preferred to cook salmon, prawns and chicken. It seemed a bit limited. Had life become so sterile that it was considered dangerous to cook a glistening whole mackerel, with its saline scent and provocative bones? I need not have worried - it seems that our piscine timidity is fast disappearing. Where once my local fishmonger displayed plaice and trout, he now arranges fantastical farmed sturgeon and monstrous-headed monkfish. Chefs are slowly but surely persuading us to cook everything from spiced sea bass to scallop sashimi. Adrian Rudolf, owner of Fish &amp; Fowl in Parliament Hill, north London (020 7284 4184) explains: 'If someone like Rick Stein or Jamie Oliver has been on telly and used fillets of dorade, you will be inundated with requests for them the next day.' Vanessa Strike, joint owner of The Quayside Fish Centre in Porthleven, Cornwall (see Directory, page 53), agrees. She used to mainly sell cod, haddock and plaice; now, after countless chef programmes, her customers want sea bass, John Dory, red mullet and brill. She believes that such programmes, combined with more travelling and eating out, have opened people's eyes to the pleasures of fish. 'It's not unusual these days for someone to ask us for pomfret or red snapper,' she says. 'We've even had requests for zebra fish. Apparently, it is very nice.' Shrinking home stocks, however, have also led to unfamiliar fish appearing in the markets. 'If the weather is bad and the fish is scarce,' explains Vanessa, 'you can't afford to have a bare fish counter, so you have to buy in exotics like swordfish or marlin.' As a supplier to both the restaurant trade and the public, Adrian Rudolf has also experienced the rising popularity of fish first-hand. 'In a few years,' he says, 'chefs have doubled the number of fish dishes on their menus, and where they once used one fishmonger, they now buy from three or four.' Consequently, many suppliers have had to specialise in one or two fish, such as tuna or wild salmon. Most are now expected to fillet and portion the fish before delivery, and you should never be afraid to ask your fishmonger to do this for you. Curiously, the chefs themselves modestly attribute their customers' increased appetite for fish to a growing awareness of healthy eating. Some, such as Richard Corrigan, suspect that anxiety over farming practices has led to this trend. In reality, many chefs are proactive in shaping their customers' tastes. Germain Schwab, chef/proprietor of Winteringham Fields in North Lincolnshire, is a classic example. 'When we first opened in 1989,' he recalls, 'nobody ate much fish here. I decided to give them a tiny fish appetiser to try and tempt them.' Then they started to order them when he transferred them on to the menu. It is never easy to predict where such fashions will lead. Perhaps a glance at restaurant menus reveals the future. It seems to lie with simply cooked, filleted fish, such as pan-fried char with samphire, or sea bream with tapenade and balsamic vinaigrette. A far cry from processed prawns and flabby farmed salmon. Vineet Bhatia of Zaika No fish is safe from Vineet Bhatia, head chef of Zaika, in west London. Every ingredient that enters his kitchen is analysed for its role in creating a subtly spiced, modern Indian dish. If he is presented with a Black Scabbard and finds that its gelatinous, pearly white flesh makes wonderful sweet dumplings, then he will serve them wrapped in gold leaf and floating in a creamy cardamom sauce. Vineet Bhatia specialised in Indian cooking at the prestigious Oberoi Hotel School of Management in New Delhi. His fascination has led him to develop a lighter style of cooking which combines traditional Indian spices with non-Indian flavourings, such as lime leaves, lemon grass and honey. He then combines regional techniques to create a new style of cooking. Thus his recipe for spicy sea bass with Indian couscous fries the fish Bengali style and serves it with a typical Punjabi sauce and an unusually spiced south Indian semolina base. These days, he thinks nothing of making a firm-fleshed halibut biryani or of gently poaching scallops in a delicious chilli and lemon-grass coconut sauce. All of which might sound a little dubious to those who like their poppadoms plain, but one bite of his scallops with their accompanying whipped masala mashed potato and you may find that your local take-away has lost its charm. Zaika, 257-259 Fulham Road, London SW3 (020 7351 7823) Spicy sea bass with Indian couscous Some supermarkets sell gram flour, green mangoes and coarse semolina, but you can find them, along with fresh curry leaves, in Asian shops. Serves 4. Tikhi machli - marinated fish 6 dried, long red chillies 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped 60ml sunflower oil lemon, juiced a pinch of salt 4 x 800g sea bass, scaled, cleaned and filleted 120g natural yogurt 20g gram flour tsp turmeric powder 20ml sunflower oil 1 tsp cumin seeds 1cm fresh ginger, finely diced 1 fresh green chilli, cut into fine strips 1 dried, long red chilli 1 sprig of fresh curry leaves a pinch of asafoetida (optional) 1 tablespoons roughly chopped coriander leaves Upma - Indian couscous 15ml sunflower oil 15g butter 1 tsp dark brown (Indian) mustard seeds 1 tsp finely chopped fresh ginger 1 tsp finely chopped, seeded green chilli a sprig of fresh curry leaves 75g coarse semolina 80ml canned coconut milk 1 tsp lemon juice 1 tsp caster sugar 2 tbsps chopped coriander leaves for the garnish unpeeled green mango, finely sliced into fine matchsticks, optional Begin by marinating the fish. Soak 6 dried chillies in warm water for 30 minutes until soft. Drain and pur\u00e9e, then mix in the garlic, oil, lemon juice and salt. Remove the fine pin bones running down each fillet with a pair of tweezers. Trim and halve the fillets across, cutting a few gashes into their skin to help the marinade. Don a pair of rubber gloves and rub the marinade into the filleted fish. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Next, make the sauce by mixing together the yogurt, gram flour, turmeric, salt and 300ml water. Heat the oil in a saucepan, add the cumin seeds, ginger, green chilli, the whole red chilli, curry leaves and asafoetida in quick succession. As it splutters, add the yogurt mixture, bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 8 minutes, stirring continuously to prevent lumps forming. Strain the sauce, add more water if necessary to ensure that it has a creamy consistency, and check the seasoning. Set aside while you prepare the upma. Place 15ml oil in a deep saucepan with the butter. Set over a medium heat and stir in the mustard seeds. As they crackle, add the ginger, green chilli and curry leaves. Then lower the heat and add the semolina. Dry roast for 5-6 minutes until it releases a nutty aroma. Stir in 240ml warm water and the coconut milk. Increase the heat and add the lemon juice, a pinch of salt and sugar. Cook for a further 3 minutes. Finally, cook the fish over a medium-high heat, skin-side down in a non-stick frying pan. Once it is half cooked, with crisp skin, turn it over and cook for a further minute. Then rest for a few minutes while you reheat the sauce. Once it's hot, mix 1 tbsps chopped coriander leaves into the sauce and 2 tbsps chopped coriander to the upma. Spoon the upma into the centre of 4 soup-bowl plates. Pour the sauce around it and place the pan-fried sea bass on top of the upma. Garnish with raw mango matchsticks, if you wish.

Never use frozen scallops for this recipe - they should always be fresh. If you're buying fresh out of the shell, always check that they are very fresh indeed.

Serves 4 as an pre-appetiser; serves 2 as an appetiser. 8 raw sweet shrimp ( pandauls borealis , also known as Greenland prawns or ama ebi) 4 large scallops (live, if possible) 1 garlic clove, crushed into pur\u00e9e 30g fresh ginger, peeled and finely sliced into matchsticks 1 bunch chives, finely sliced freshly ground black pepper 5 dessertspoons Japanese soy (Kikkoman) mixed with 1 dessertspoon fresh lemon juice 2 teaspoons 10 year old balsamic vinegar 10g white sesame seeds, lightly toasted 4 dessertspoons light olive oil mixed with 1 dessertspoon sesame oil Remove the prawns' heads and peel away their shells. If a black line runs down their backs (their digestive cord), gently pull away and clean. Open the scallops with a table knife and remove them from their shells, taking care to keep them whole. Gently remove the skirt - which looks like a piece of elastic - from the white muscle before discarding the white muscle. (If you have bought shelled scallops, they will not have the skirt, but you will still need to discard the white muscle.) Soak the skirts in salted water and scrub to remove any sand. Rub the large end of a chopstick along the length of the skirt on a flat surface to remove any sand from inside the skirt. Wash and pat dry the scallops, then, using a very sharp knife, slice them into as many thin, whole, round slices as possible. It is important to cut each slice in one movement - slicing towards yourself. If you use a sawing movement the scallop will break up. Arrange the shrimp, scallop slices and skirt flat on a serving dish. Rub with the garlic pur\u00e9e. Sprinkle the shredded ginger and sliced chives evenly over the top of the dish, before seasoning to taste with the black pepper, soy sauce and lemon mixture, balsamic vinegar and the toasted sesame seeds. Heat the olive oil and sesame oil mixture until it is smoking, and drizzle a little over the top of the dish to sear the shellfish and activate all the flavours. Serve immediately. Richard Corrigan of Lindsay House A dainty dish of wild salmon is not quite what one associates with Richard Corrigan, the bluff Irish chef of Lindsay House, in Soho. Hearty plates of pigs' trotters and black pudding, yes - but red mullet, sea bream and lobster, no. Such stereotyping clearly upset Corrigan, as he explains: 'I always serve fish in the summer,' he says. 'I only have two meat dishes on at the moment, just as in winter I usually only offer two fish dishes. This is a commercial restaurant - I serve people what they want to eat.' Having grown up on a farm in County Meath, one of seven children, he developed a taste for freshwater fish when young. His father was an expert poacher and extended the family diet by netting wild salmon for breakfast and keeping eels in the river in a big washtub punctured with holes. 'To see a 12lb wild salmon being shared out by the men to feed several families is a beautiful thing,' says Corrigan. 'When it is really fresh, it smells of fresh grass.' As a child he would catch young pike with a lump of meat. 'My mother would bake it with bay leaves, butter and seasoning and serve it for supper with a pool of salty butter and a salad.' His cooking may have become more sophisticated, but clearly his taste has been shaped by his past. His wild salmon is still liberally seasoned and served with a butter sauce, albeit flavoured with fennel and brown shrimp. Lindsay House, 21 Romilly Street, London W1 (020 7439 0450) Wild salmon, salsify and brown shrimp with fennel emulsion The following recipe can be adapted by replacing the salsify with asparagus, in which case allow 4 tips per person and cook in boiling water until tender. Salsify can sometimes be found in specialist greengrocers and organic shops. Lardo is the fat from Parma ham; you can also use the fatty part of Parma ham slices. Serves 4. 4 wild salmon steaks (about 150g each) cut from the centre, about 2cm thick, central bone and skin removed 4 strips lardo (see above) sunflower oil for the salsify juice of lemon 8 sticks salsify 1-2 garlic cloves, peeled fresh bouquet garni of thyme and bay leaf 30g unsalted butter 80g peeled brown shrimp (to be added right at the end) for the fennel emulsion unsalted butter bulb fennel, chopped, reserve the feathery part or use 2 tbsps finely chopped fennel herb leaves 1 garlic clove, chopped 1 shallot, chopped 150ml vegetable stock 6 tbsps double cream salt and freshly ground black pepper Be sure all the bones have been removed from the salmon steaks. Wrap a strip of lardo around the outside of each steak, just as you would wrap a tournedos in fat, and tie it on with string. Set aside in the fridge. To prepare the salsify, half fill a deep saucepan with water and add the lemon juice. Trim and peel the salsify, then cut in half, dropping each stick into the acidulated water as it is prepared (to prevent discolouration). When all the salsify is in the pan, add the garlic and bouquet garni and bring to the boil. Simmer for 5-6 minutes, or until the salsify is just tender, but still quite firm. Remove from the heat and leave to cool in the liquid. When cool enough to handle, drain and cut into matchsticks 13-15cm long. Set aside. If using asparagus, keep the tips whole. Preheat the oven to 230 C/gas mark 8. To make the fennel emulsion, melt a knob of butter in a saucepan, add the fennel (but not the feathery bits), garlic and shallot, and sweat gently until very soft. Pour in the stock and bring to the boil. Add the cream and stir, then simmer for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Pur\u00e9e the mixture in a blender or food processor, then press it though a sieve into a clean pan. Add the chopped feathery part of the fennel (or chopped herb fennel) and season with salt and pepper. Set aside. To cook the salmon, put a film of sunflower oil in a cast-iron frying pan that has an ovenproof handle and set over a medium heat. Season the salmon steaks. When the oil is hot, put the salmon steaks in the pan and sear for about 30 seconds on each side. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook for about 5 minutes (the salmon will be medium rare). To finish the salsify or asparagus, melt the butter in a frying pan and toss with the shrimp to reheat. Season to taste. Reheat the fennel emulsion, if necessary. To serve, pile the salsify in the centre of each warmed plate and set a salmon steak on top. Spoon the fennel emulsion around. Serve immediately. Georgio Locatelli of Zafferano Georgio Locatelli wanted to give his recipe for breadcrumbed eel for this article. 'It's delicious,' he urged. 'You just have to throw it on to the embers of a dying barbecue, and in 20 minutes you can eat it. You bite through the crisp crust and it melts in your mouth.' 'But Georgio,' I protested, 'how do you prepare the eel?' 'Ah well,' he replied. 'You do have to kill it, then hang it over a sink and skin it.' He paused, then added, 'It's not very nice, even when you have a special implement to dispatch it quickly.' Tasty though his dish sounded, we agreed that perhaps it would be better to settle for his gilt-headed sea bream (orata) instead, something you can buy ready-filleted from the fishmonger. In true Italian manner, Locatelli is generous and enthusiastic about all his cooking. Born in a Michelin-starred restaurant in Corgenno, near the lakes in northern Italy, he found his place in the kitchen at the age of five. 'Freshwater fish is really underrated here in Britain,' he remarks. 'Perch, pike and eel are completely overshadowed by farmed salmon.' Nevertheless, he clearly manages to console himself by serving other delicacies such as small, breadcrumbed red mullet, pancetta-wrapped monkfish with samphire, char-grilled calamari with tomato and, of course, orata with spinach, balsamic vinaigrette and a piquant sesame radish garnish. His food is labelled as modern Italian. Simply prepared, with good ingredients and bold flavours, it has won him a Michelin star for his Knightsbridge restaurant. Zafferano, 15 Lowndes Street, London SW1 (020 7235 5800) Pan-fried fillets of sea bream with tapenade and balsamic vinaigrette A cleaned sea bream weighing 600g should yield two fillets, each about 200g. Serves 6. 12 tbsps balsamic vinaigrette (see below) 6 tsps black olive tapenade (see below) 3 handfuls blanched spinach (about 600g raw baby-leaf spinach) a medium-sized bunch of chives 6 red radishes light-flavoured extra-virgin olive oil for pan-frying 6 fillets of sea bream, each weighing about 200g a small knob of butter mixed with a little olive oil 1 tbsps sesame oil Before you begin, make the balsamic vinaigrette and black olive tapenade (see below). Blanch the spinach by dropping in batches into a pan of boiling water. As soon as it wilts remove and cool under cold water, wring dry and set aside. Just before cooking, slice the chives into 3cm lengths. Then wash, trim and cut the radishes into fine sticks, the same length. Mix together. Heat the light olive oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Season the fish fillets and then cook them skin-side down for about 3-4 minutes. Meanwhile, toss the blanched spinach with some melted butter and a little olive oil in a pan set over a low heat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. By now, the fish should be cooked. Turn it over, flesh side down for a few seconds to seal it. Then remove from the hot pan and place on kitchen paper to remove any excess fat. Place the spinach in the centre of 6 large, deep, warm plates. Using a spatula, quickly spread 1 tsp of tapenade over the flesh of each fillet and place on top of the spinach. Season the radish and chive salad with salt, freshly ground black pepper and the sesame oil. Then sprinkle over each portion of fish. Finally, pour 2 tbsps balsamic dressing around the spinach on each plate. Serve immediately. Zafferano's balsamic vinaigrette This makes far more than you need, but the rest can be kept for salads. 125ml balsamic vinegar (such as Agazotti Gold Top) 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar (Agazotti aged 40 years - or use the best you can get for both types) 1 generous tbsp lemon juice tsp Worcestershire sauce tbsp millefiori (thousand-flower) honey or a good flower honey tsp caster sugar 375ml good extra-virgin olive oil salt Place the two vinegars, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, honey and sugar in a bowl. Warm it slightly to melt the honey and infuse the flavours. Using a plastic spoon or spatula gradually add the olive oil - pouring slowly - as the vinegar and oil should not emulsify together. Finish with a pinch of salt to taste. The vinegar and oil should separate - so give them a slight stir just before serving. Black olive tapenade Serves 6 220g Tagiasche olives (stoned) or small black olives 40g anchovy fillets 2 tbsps of Tonatore or light-flavoured extra-virgin olive oil Place the olives, anchovy fillets and garlic in a small blender and slowly add the oil. Use as directed above. Germain Schwab of Winteringham Fields Germain Schwab, chef/owner of his restaurant, is a man entranced by nature. Living in the depths of rural North Lincolnshire, he utilises everything around him to create exquisite seasonal food. The first whiff of lime blossom on the summer air and it is picked and transformed into a piquant sauce for brill. As soon as the first summer morels begin to appear nearby, he will gather them up as an accompaniment to turbot, stuffed with a tiny spoonful of turbot mousse. Schwab's philosophy is simple. 'I try to be inventive with local produce,' he says, forgetting to add that as a result he has been awarded two Michelin stars and a '9' in The Good Food Guide . Nearly half of his menu uses fish, much of it from British rivers and lakes - perhaps as a result of his having been born in the landlocked Jura. 'My fishmonger in Grimsby buys me freshwater char (omble-chevalier) from Wiltshire,' he states. 'It doesn't get the recognition here it deserves, but I have always loved it.' He frequently partners it with succulent English samphire, which has just come into season on the salt marshes. Everything Schwab buys has to be gleaming fresh. 'With fish, you need to look for sparkling eyes, bright red gills and a lovely colour. Char or wild salmon should literally look vivid,' he says. Then it is a question of creating a harmonious dish with home-grown ingredients like lovage, English mace ( Achillea decoloras ) and basil. Summer on a plate, you might say. Winteringham Fields, Winteringham, North Lincolnshire (01724 733 096). Rooms are available if you wish to stay overnight Pan-fried fillet of char, marsh samphire and gazpacho coulis If you wish to buy char, ask your fishmonger to order it from CJ Newnes &amp; Partners, Shop 10, Billingsgate Market, Trafalgar Way, London E14 (020 7515 0793). Alternatively, you can order it direct from them - provided you collect it from Billingsgate between 5am and 8am. Serves 6 as a starter. 3 char, 225g each, filleted 180g marsh samphire, washed 1 small carrot medium celeriac 2 tomatoes 1 red pepper cucumber 6 basil leaves 18 sprigs English mace or tarragon for the coulis 1 chopped shallot 1 tsp chopped garlic 5-10g butter 200ml fresh fish stock (not a cube) 25ml white-wine vinegar fresh red or green chilli for the seasoning Tabasco, soy sauce, sugar and Worcestershire sauce You need to keep nearly all your vegetable trimmings, including your tomato seeds. All of the following have to be cut into 1cm dice or squares. So peel the carrot and celeriac, then cut into 1cm dice. Blanch in boiling salted water and refresh in cold water. Blanch the tomatoes in boiling salted water for 10 seconds, then peel, seed and cut into 1cm squares. Set the trimmings to one side. Quarter and seed the red pepper (discard the seeds) and cut into 1cm squares. Peel and seed the cucumber (discard the peel and seeds), then dice the flesh into 1cm cubes. Cut the basil leaves into 1cm squares. Mix together the diced carrot, celeriac, tomatoes, cucumber, pepper and basil in a large bowl. Sweat the shallot and garlic with the butter in a saucepan, making sure it does not colour. Add the vegetable trimmings with the fish stock, vinegar and chilli. Simmer for 5 minutes, then blend in a food processor and pass through a fine sieve. Season to taste with salt, pepper, Tabasco, soy sauce, sugar and Worcestershire sauce. When you are ready to serve, bring the coulis just to the boil, add the diced vegetables and basil. Meanwhile, pan-fry the char on one side with the lid on until cooked for about 3 minutes. Drop the samphire in a pan of boiling water (no salt) for about a minute, until it is hot but not overcooked. Drain and season with a little butter and pepper. Place the samphire on the left-hand side of each plate and the char just on top of the samphire. Pour the warm coulis and diced vegetables around the plate. Sprinkle each plate with the English mace or tarragon sprigs and serve immediately.",

      "body": "<p>If you weren't a Nesser, you didn't belong. Well, that's what it used to be like in Dungeness when this tiny Kent fishing community was literally cut off from the outside world and visited just once a week by a horse and cart carrying supplies. There were the Oillers, the Tarts, the Thomases and the Richardsons, fishing families one and all, and, not surprisingly, all related. </p> <p>'I was an Oiller and married a Tart, and my mother was a Tart and married an Oiller,' says Doris Tart, who still lives in the house she was born in 78 years ago. </p> <p>Dungeness sticks its nose out into the English Channel from the south-eastern tip of the Romney and Walland marshes. One of the world's largest shingle promontories, it's a windy, desolate, but dramatic landscape wrested from the sea by the Romans, where wild flowers and shimmering grasses cling to the pebble surface and migratory birds stop off for a breather after their long-haul flights. Where the shingle ends, there is an abrupt drop down to the sand flats and the water. In fog or early morning mist, when the sea is completely shrouded, you feel as if you could plummet off the end of the world. </p> <p>Doris's pink and green cottage, Ocean View, is the first of half a dozen fishermen's cottages strung out in a line along the eastern side of the Ness. The small, simple clapboard houses all face out to sea, the road in front of them leading to the lighthouse which blinks lazily in the distance, while behind lurks the local leviathan: a massive nuclear power station that lets out a constant hum and a trickle of smoke. During the day, the dull grey mass of the power station takes on the presence of a faded backdrop, while at night it lights up like Vegas. Either way, it towers over Dungeness, accentuating the smallness of the community, exposed as it is on a vast, flat expanse of land and buffeted from both east and west by strong, salty winds. </p> <p>In the past, before the road was built, each fisherman kept his boat in front of his house, from where tracks ran down to the coast to bring the fish back over the shingle. Each had his own storage hut as well, a large shed thrown together from driftwood. Some of the tracks remain, and many of the old huts are still standing - leaning this way and that, their doors and windows either gaping holes or completely boarded up. </p> <p>Inside, old rusty tools, matted nets, furniture, and in one, a black jacket and red- and-white scarf hanging on a hook, have all been abandoned, left to be slowly battered into oblivion by the abrasive elements. All around, marooned boats and debris litter the shingle: ancient metal chains half sub merged under pebbles; an old lorry engine left high and dry; tyres; anchors; timber and rusted iron and a worktable sporting a no-nonsense clamp - Dungeness's recent history is all here. </p> <p>One old shack, a patchwork of old doors, driftwood and corrugated iron, houses a massive, old lorry engine used for winching boats ashore. Hefty workmen's gloves lie discarded on the floor, their owner long gone, while the wind whistles through, eating away at wood and metal alike. The air is filled with a delicious honey-sweet smell from the clumps of sea kale which cover the shingle, and tar used to protect the boats and buildings. </p> <p>Shingle is, by nature, always on the move, and over the years, the expanse between the cottages and the coastline has stretched and stretched, forcing the fishermen to build new generations of sheds nearer to the sea. Everything changed when the road was built. That was during the Second World War, when Dungeness was full of troops and the locals had to have a special passport just to get into the village. </p> <p>'We were on alert all the time,' recalls Doris, pushing aside a crab she is in the middle of preparing. 'If Hitler had invaded, it was going to be along this coast.' The Ness, as a result, was heavily mined, with just the narrowest of strips left clear for the fishermen to launch their boats. </p> <p>Today everything has shunted further down the beach towards the lighthouse, where the water is deeper and able to take the larger boats that are now used. New fishing huts have sprung up all around - but times have changed, and the romantic old shacks have been replaced with second- hand lorry containers, which are cheaper, more secure and able to put up more of a fight against the voracious wind. </p> <p>Jumbo, a retired fisherman, still keeps his old black container, which he visits when he can. He also looks after another which belonged to his neighbour, Gordon, who died a few years ago. Gordon's hut is more like a little home - a large wooden construction with an arched roof, filled with a table and chairs and all his fishing gear, just as he left it. </p> <p>About 40 fishermen work in Dungeness today, in crews of two to five. On the boat by 4am or 5am, and hopefully back by midday with a catch which includes cod, plaice, Dover sole, crabs and turbot, it's a gruelling life. Most of the time, the area around the boats is completely deserted, the odd car evidence that its owner is out at sea. There's the occasional burst of activity as boats come in and hauls are unloaded, but otherwise it is still a ghost town piled high with nets, crates of equipment and tangled junk: the rectan gular box of an old red Royal Mail van here, and a bashed-around black van there, its wheels knocked from under it and its cabin removed. </p> <p>Kenny Thomas has been a fisherman all his life, and his father and grandfather before him. His son Joe is also following in their footsteps. Kenny's great-grandfather was a deep-sea diver brought in to dive on the wrecks. 'He married one of the Tart girls,' says Kenny. 'It's all Tarts and Oillers round here.' When his great-grandmother and then grandfather died, their children were dispersed around the family, which saw his grandfather being sent to his aunt ('who was a Tart') in Dungeness. Kenny happily admits that 'everyone is related to everyone else somewhere along the line', the reason being that 'there was no road, so they all married each other'. </p> <p>The fact that everything, once finished with, is left to crumble where it stands and go back to the soil - metal, plastic and even nylon nets all eventually succumbing to the erosive weather - makes Dungeness a beachcomber's paradise. </p> <p>The late film director Derek Jarman, who bought Gran and Granddad Char's Prospect Cottage in 1986, made full use of the treasure to be found on his doorstep. Rocks, pebbles, wood, shells, iron and glass have all been used to sculpt his garden. The result: a beautiful collection of totem-like pieces of driftwood, orange California poppies, herbs and all manner of plants bordered by sun-bleached sticks, rusted old chains and large, upright stones, which he likened to dolmens. </p> <p>Prospect Cottage is one of the few fishermen's cottage to have a garden - the rest keep things plain and simple, in line with the architecture and the bare, minimalist aesthetic of Dungeness. No fences interrupt the line of vision. The buildings stand in stark relief against the surrounding space and shingle, low to the ground, like the plants, all the better to withstand the relentless wind. </p> <p>Winter in Dungeness is harsh and cold, and the winds are fierce. This is also the time when the shingle shifts eastwards, away from the power station and round to the cottages. Whoever had the bright idea of building a nuclear power station on such precarious ground clearly wasn't looking to the future. Now a stream of lorries is forced to trundle endlessly back and forth replacing the shingle to stop the power station from slipping into the sea. </p> <p>But during the spring and summer months, the tourists arrive, strangely drawn to this surreal, unique setting. Visitors can take in the old lighthouse, with its great views of the Ness, the local RSPB bird reserve, or hop on the miniature steam train which chugs back and forth between Hythe and Dungeness. Fashion shoots on the beach are commonplace, and there's always a steady trickle of Jarman pilgrims. There is also an undeniable fascination with the local community, which remains so strong, and the history of the place, which still sees fishermen dredging up old shells from the Battle of Britain. </p> <p>Inhospitable as it is, Dungeness gets under the skin. Doris, for one, will never leave, and turned down a holiday on a Fiji island offered by a French Tart who tracked her down (the Tarts originated in France but were driven out by the Huguenots). And although it is no longer cut off from the outside world, Dungeness is still primarily a working fishing village. It is also a preservation area, protected from development by the Dungeness Trust, which suits Doris just fine. 'I don't mind,' she says. 'As long as it stays as it is while I'm on deck.'</p>",

The result: a beautiful collection of totem-like pieces of driftwood, orange California poppies, herbs and all manner of plants bordered by sun-bleached sticks, rusted old chains and large, upright stones, which he likened to dolmens. Prospect Cottage is one of the few fishermen's cottage to have a garden - the rest keep things plain and simple, in line with the architecture and the bare, minimalist aesthetic of Dungeness. No fences interrupt the line of vision. The buildings stand in stark relief against the surrounding space and shingle, low to the ground, like the plants, all the better to withstand the relentless wind. Winter in Dungeness is harsh and cold, and the winds are fierce. This is also the time when the shingle shifts eastwards, away from the power station and round to the cottages. Whoever had the bright idea of building a nuclear power station on such precarious ground clearly wasn't looking to the future. Now a stream of lorries is forced to trundle endlessly back and forth replacing the shingle to stop the power station from slipping into the sea. But during the spring and summer months, the tourists arrive, strangely drawn to this surreal, unique setting. Visitors can take in the old lighthouse, with its great views of the Ness, the local RSPB bird reserve, or hop on the miniature steam train which chugs back and forth between Hythe and Dungeness. Fashion shoots on the beach are commonplace, and there's always a steady trickle of Jarman pilgrims. There is also an undeniable fascination with the local community, which remains so strong, and the history of the place, which still sees fishermen dredging up old shells from the Battle of Britain. Inhospitable as it is, Dungeness gets under the skin. Doris, for one, will never leave, and turned down a holiday on a Fiji island offered by a French Tart who tracked her down (the Tarts originated in France but were driven out by the Huguenots). And although it is no longer cut off from the outside world, Dungeness is still primarily a working fishing village. It is also a preservation area, protected from development by the Dungeness Trust, which suits Doris just fine. 'I don't mind,' she says. 'As long as it stays as it is while I'm on deck.'",

      "body": "<p>It's a hot early summer afternoon in LA, and we're driving through Beverly Hills, slowly making our way out of town, up the Pacific Coastal Highway. On the left, the Pacific Ocean blinks invitingly at the traffic. Travelling no faster than 10mph, locked into a tailback, the minutes cease to hold any resonance. </p> <p>From the slow procession of cars - LA city workers travelling back to their hill-side mansions in Malibu - blares a cacophony of differing sounds. No one is impatient; loose, sun-tanned arms hang out of every window, fingers happily drumming on the side of the car. Peering from window to window, catching a glimpse at individual universes, I see people smiling. Almost all are singing: 'God only knows/What I'd be without you'; 'Round, round, get-a-round/I get around'; 'Welcome to the Hotel California. Such a lovely place/Such a lovely face'. </p> <p>John Steinbeck periodically hitchhiked up and down this stretch in the 40s, finally settling down in Salinas, 100 miles further up the coast. The truck stops give way to Mexican diners, before leading to the doorways of bankrupt farmers; the road is Steinbeck's agrarian America personified. A 700-mile stretch of the cruel and the kind. </p> <p>We are on our way to interview kd lang, who is filming her latest video somewhere south of Malibu. We are already half an hour behind schedule, but neither my companion nor I seem worried. As we gaze at the cliff-top houses on our right, precariously balanced on rocky ridges above the highway, we locate a procession of trucks by the roadside. kd lang's video shoot, inside the grounds of a smallish and dilapidated bungalow, has brought the traffic to a standstill. </p> <p>Walking up the ridged driveway that leads up to the house, the singer can be seen hovering around the back garden. She is midway through a take, wearing a Pacific blue work shirt hanging over grey tracksuit bottoms. Her sweat in the daylight gives her the warm glow of someone who has just been jogging. She looks bigger, healthier than I remember; perhaps her frame is too bulky for that honeysuckle voice. Her boyish hair snakes around her face as she sings to the backing tape. At one point, after the director shouts 'Cut!', she makes exaggerated boy-band poses; hula-hooping her hips while her fists punch the air, seesaw-style. </p> <p>'Hiya,' she grins, when we are introduced. It's impossible not to grin back. Stepping forward, I shake her hand. Hers is a friendly, warm, palmy handshake. 'We'll chat in a minute,' she promises. 'We can talk between takes in my trailer. I have lots of time off this afternoon. Hey! In the meantime, help yourself to something to eat.' </p> <p>I hover around the driveway, stopping off for a coffee. Between cigarettes, I wander back to the garden, looking at kd lang sitting by a window, still singing at the camera. She looks shyly at the director, then at the crew. The song is the first single from her new album Invincible Summer, produced by Damian le Gassick, occasional collaborator with Madonna and William Orbit. </p> <p>Sitting idly on a log bench at the back of the garden, listening to kd lang sing the warm, heartfelt words, I momentarily doze off. She walks over after the music stops. 'C'mon, then. We'll go down to my trailer.' </p> <p>kd lang shuffles behind me in her white rubber flip-flops as we walk up the highway to her trailer. She turns away from the traffic anxiously as it passes her side up the road. For two days, the video shoot has slowed down the three-lane road to a near standstill. 'Man, these people must hate me,' laughs kd lang. 'I'm stopping them from getting were they want to go.' </p> <p>We clamber into her trailer - slow, careful steps so we don't fall off - and kd lang immediately ushers me to the kitchen table by the rear window. As I unpack my tape recorder, she clasps and unclasps her hands in front of her face, viewing the Dictaphone suspiciously. Her quiet voice occasionally breaks into a riotous guffaw. 'You're not going to ask me any awkward questions, are you?' she joshes. She picks at her fingernails; they've all been chewed methodically down to the quick. I think of other caramel-voiced, lesbian country-and-western singers to strike a comparison against, and strike nothing. </p> <p>Kathryn Dawn Lang was born on 2 November 1961 in Edmonton, Canada. Inspired at an early age by country-and-western diva Patsy Cline, kd lang formed The Reclines, a garage-influenced country group, who released a string of critically acclaimed albums in the mid-80s: Truly Western Experience, Angel With a Lariat, Shadowland and Absolute Torch &amp; Twang. </p> <p>Alongside musicians such as Lyle Lovett and Steve Earle, kd lang came to epitomise 'new country' - and soon came into conflict with the Nashville old guard. Earle, in particular, carburettor-voiced with his dramatic tales of Harley-Davidsons and small-town miscreants on Death Row, quickly found himself without a deal. Sitting in her trailer, kd lang recalls, 'He really went out of his way to kick up a fuss at everything he saw wrong. I was more careful, took my time in making my own judgments about Nashville and what I was doing there. As a woman, especially in country, you have to be very careful. Country music is still one of the last bastions of old, white men. There are some incredible attitudes there that you don't see in other parts of the recording industry. Look at all these new country girls at the moment. Incredibly clean-cut, sexy, but not trampy. Country music - as run by Nashville - has always wanted to protect womankind. Can you imagine just how stifling that can be after a while?' </p> <p>Continuing to write and record, kd lang built up a sizeable alternative audience outside the US, where the new country was more readily received. It wasn't until the success of 1992's Ing\u00e9nue, however, that she was finally accepted as a mainstream performer. The record was an immediate success; its lovelorn ballads drawing from resolutely anti-Nashville influences, such as Love, The Mamas and the Papas and The Beach Boys. 'The country music press was very hostile,' smiles kd lang. 'But by that time, I'd been picked up by pop radio.' </p> <p>The same year, kd lang removed herself further from her country-and-western audience by publicly declaring her lesbianism. Her career had, until then, been plagued by rumours of her sexuality. In an interview with the American rock bible Rolling Stone, she alluded to her alternative lifestyle. A subsequent cover for Vanity Fair, showing her in male drag being shaved by Cindy Crawford, caused further outrage. </p> <p>It was a hugely cathartic moment. 'I got all these letters from people who had never met me,' she mumbles. 'All horrible things, people screaming like I'd let them down.' </p> <p>She looks nervous. 'I don't like being interviewed,' she admits. 'It's a bit of a nerve-wracking experience.' Why? 'I guess I'm quite shy. I'd rather make the records and tour.' </p> <p>Her life in Los Angeles is surprisingly low-key these days. Gone are the times when she reinvented herself as an oversexed conquistador and was linked to Madonna around the time of the Sex project. 'I bought a house a couple of years ago,' she says, sipping weak coffee from her mug. 'And I hang out there with my friends. Don't get back to Canada as often as I used to, either.' </p> <p>Her new album, Invincible Summer, has been almost two years in the recording. 'I wanted a warm sound for this,' she says. 'Even though I'm making pop music now, I still have all those country-and-western leanings. So I look at each individual album as a collection that says something different from last time. It's the way Patsy Cline recorded, and how I was in Nashville. I want a body of work not just albums. There has to be a theme, some kind of evolution.' </p> <p>The singer gets called back to the set, so I trudge back down the PCH to the house. I can hear her singing somewhere in a room above. Half an hour later, back in the trailer, she grasps another mug of coffee. Her coming-out in 1992, I venture: was it orches trated? 'Absolutely not,' she says, blushing. 'God, if it was then that must have been the most clumsy thing ever! The rumours had plagued me for years, everyone talked about it. Critics would often ask me questions about my personal life. Was there a boyfriend? I'd smile, and turn the conversation around. Sure, there is someone, I'd say. Or, I'm not that interested in a relationship at the moment. </p> <p>'It was incredibly difficult to conduct interviews for a while, so we went to Rolling Stone and told them,' she continues. 'But I certainly didn't expect the kind of reaction that it got. My fans were horrified. And I didn't get it. I'd always thought country music was about tough choice and heartbreak. But you come up against some really old-fashioned bigotry. Well, look at us now. Steve Earle makes all kinds of music, Lyle Lovett has become an underground hero. And I make pop music. After a while, I just couldn't take the endless criticism any more.' </p> <p>She sighs as she receives another call from the director. I follow her back to the set; it's fast approaching six in the evening. The crew hunkers down for a final take, and with the video declared finished, starts to pack the lighting equipment into vans adjacent to the highway. Driving back down the PCH, later that night, I run through LA's radio stations searching for an appropriate tune. I settle on 'Constant Craving', arriving back in LA soothed by kd lang's soaring vocals. </p> <p>It's too hot the next morning when I climb up Sunset Boulevard towards the Chateau Marmont where kd lang has a room. Reaching the hotel early, I backtrack to the Virgin record store a couple of blocks away and start skimming through her back catalogue. On her early album sleeves, she looks heavily posed, visibly uncomfortable in the pictures. Yesterday, she'd revealed why she's moved to Los Angeles. 'It's quiet here,' she'd said. 'No one knows me. Everyone's out look ing for the hot new face. Besides, I've never bothered to cultivate a scene around me.' </p> <p>I walk back to her hotel, sweating in the stifling mid-morning heat. Sitting in the garden out back, kd lang is still dressed in her work shirt from the day before. 'Hey, how was your night?' she asks. 'Did you go out?' I tell her I went out for dinner with friends. She asks for the name of the restaurant. 'I'll make a point of going there,' she notes. </p> <p>I watch her chewing her nails as I unpack my Dictaphone. It's a habit that draws people to her, this quiet, shy, recording artist who became the bane of the Nashville trustees. </p> <p>'They just didn't know what to make of me,' says kd lang, giggling. 'Women are not expected to behave that way . We're supposed to be demure and silent until we are spoken to. Not that I was some radical feminist, I just didn't want to sing the rubbish that was coming out at that time.' </p> <p>Still, she admits she would like to return to her country roots one day. 'Yeah, it might be good fun. I think it would be good to go back and maybe do an album of standards, or something.' She laughs: 'We could get together, all the new country musicians, and record an album asking for forgiveness.' </p> <p>She still looks nervous, anticipating every question. Some of the old country idioms have yet to iron themselves out of her character, I reason. Most country performers are always embarrassingly insecure in their hospitality. Like Berry Gordy's finishing school at Motown, Nashville drums into its performers a sense of decorum and taste. Then, as in the case of kd lang, it flinches with rage when the stars try their hand at individuality. </p> <p>kd lang is painfully polite, occasionally stopping to ask if I need anything. 'Are you sure you wouldn't like some more coffee?' she asks. 'What about something to eat? Did you get breakfast all right?' </p> <p>We start to talk about her voice in the early years - how she would occasionally break down in tears during the middle of a performance. 'It was incredibly moving to hear this voice coming from inside me,' she says. 'And especially up there, when I'm on stage. You get to see just how it feeds off all the emotions in the room. Sometimes it's just overwhelming. </p> <p>'I get all kinds of letters. Fans tell me that my voice is like some kind of gift from God. And I've never been ambivalent about it. When 'Constant Craving' came out, it was a huge hit. One of these songs that seemed to change people's lives, touch something inside them. Then especially, I knew what it was like to feel gifted.' She gives me a scolding look: 'So keep that cigarette away!' </p> <p>She fidgets with her lapel. Seated at the next table, friends from her record company idly chatter about the weather. As always, kd lang looks slightly self-conscious, dislocated from the scene at the Chateau Marmont. Earlier, she had described herself as a 'small town girl' who came to find refuge in the big city. It's a consistent theme in her work; her women are almost always slowly strangled by their own emotions. </p> <p>As the time comes to end the interview, kd lang smiles convincingly and gives me another palmy, full-fingered handshake. And then she retreats. As I leave the garden, she looks up momentarily and grins again. 'Have a great stay here,' she says. 'Have a great time.' </p> <p>Later that evening, I return to the record store and buy some more of her records. That night, with her voice still nagging comfortably through my hotel room, I'll dream again of the Pacific Coastal Highway. </p> <p>\u0095 Invincible Summer is released on 3 July</p>",

The first 40-odd years of Miffy's life passed in a way that might be expected - parents bought the books, children loved them, scribbled all over them and then forgot about them, as children do. But now these children have grown up and rediscovered Miffy. And not for their own offspring, but for themselves. Miffy is particularly huge in Japan, where this year vast beds of tulips have been grown in her form and fans are prepared to cross the world on pilgrimage to stand outside Bruna's front door in Utrecht.</p> <p>Here in Britain, the Frost/Yates brigade is equally Miffy mad. Miffy clothes are doing a brisk trade at Top Shop, where spaghetti-strap tops in lime and lilac and hooded jackets in navy and orange are sweeping out of stores, tucked under the business-like elbows of 30-year-olds; in Soho there's nothing quite so stylish as wearing a Miffy T-shirt. You might even go to a board meeting brandishing a mobile phone in a new Miffy carrying case.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, Bruna, now 72, is said to be delighted by this worldwide craze. He has established boundaries, though. He doesn't want his other characters, Snuffy, Boris Bear and Poppy Pig, to be used for mass-merchandising purposes - the books they appear in are apparently for children alone. There are also rules about the ways the Miffy image can be used. There is no chance of Miffy underwear, for example. Unlike the creations of authors such as AA Milne, whose Pooh books are stuffed with grown-up jokes and witty asides, Miffy's world is strictly a child's world.</p> <p>Marketing expert Alison Vellacott admits that she is mystified by it all.

According to Spratt, that sort of stuff is very last century. 'When I started out 10 years ago, we sold Mulberry all the time,' he says. 'Nowadays it goes more slowly.

      "body": "<p>I realise I'm in danger of coming across as evangelical about oily fish, such as mackerel, salmon, tuna, sardines, pilchards, trout and herrings, but they have so many positive nutritional qualities that it's hard to know where to start. Their benefits to health are primarily due to their fish-oil content, specifically omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, which encourages the liver to produce high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or 'good' cholesterol, which works to remove low-density lipoprotein (LDL), 'bad' cholesterol, from the body by transporting it to the intestine, from which it is excreted. Because LDL is deposited in the blood vessels and can cause heart attacks, angina or strokes by obstructing them, boosting your intake of HDL can reduce the risk of developing heart disease. </p> <p>Another benefit of oily fish is that it can dramatically reduce the inflammation and pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis, although many of my patients who have osteo- and psoriatic arthritis report that they feel a lot better once they start eating plenty of oily fish. Although some people believe that taking cod-liver oil helps to reduce the symptoms of arthritis, the body absorbs omega 3 and 6 fatty acids more efficiently from oily fish. </p> <p>A similar symptomatic relief can be seen in individuals who are plagued by psoriasis, a common, chronic skin disorder. Psoriasis usually manifests itself first in dry, red patches on the elbows, scalp, legs and knees that then become covered with white scales. Although there isn't a cure for this condition, dietary adjustments - and especially boosting intakes of omega fatty acids - can calm the skin down. This is because these acids alter the body's biochemistry, particularly the inflammatory reaction that is thought to bring on psoriasis. People with other skin complaints, such as eczema or acne, may also find that eating plenty of oily fish improves their complexions. </p> <p>Omega fatty acids may furthermore bring relief to women who suffer from severe womb, period or pre-menstrual breast pain. It appears that the oils enable the body to produce natural painkilling substances, as well as anti-inflammatory agents. I have observed that women who have painful periods tend to experience the greatest relief if they eat oily fish every other day during the week leading up to menstruation and some every day during their periods. </p> <p>Omega 3 fatty acids are vital for the healthy development of the brain and central nervous system in foetuses, while the mother-to-be's consumption of oily fish during pregnancy has been found to have a slightly beneficial effect on both length of gestation and birth weight. Other interesting research carried out by the Institute of Respiratory Medicine at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, Australia, suggests that there is a correlation between the consumption of oily fish and the reduction of children's risk of developing asthma. New studies are also beginning to make a connection between a deficiency in omega 3 fatty acid and depression and mental illness. </p> <p>If all of this wasn't enough, oily fish is also rich in vitamin A (also known as retinol), which is essential for growth, healthy skin and hair, good vision and strong tooth enamel, adding further compelling evidence to the argument that pregnant women should include plenty of oily fish in their diets. (Women who have been taking a fish-oil supplement like cod-liver oil should stop when they become pregnant, however, as its vitamin A concentration is too high; the level in oily fish is much lower and hence safer.) </p> <p>In addition, oily fish gives the body a good dose of vitamin D, which works in conjunction with calcium to build healthy bones and teeth. We normally synthesise the majority of the vitamin D in our bodies by exposing our skins to the sun, but because Britain doesn't see much sun from October to March we should instead rely on dietary sources of vitamin D - including oily fish - to replenish our reserves of this nutrient during the winter. People who spend a lot of time indoors, as well as older or sick people and smokers, have an increased requirement for vitamin D and should therefore ensure that they include sources of this nutrient in their diet. Remember, too, that oily fish (especially such small-boned fish as pilchards and sardines) can provide a valuable source of calcium and iron. </p> <p>However, omega oils can only work effectively if they are able to bridge the gap between the bloodstream and the brain. Because saturated fatty acids (which are contained in animal fats, such as butter, cream and cheese) compete with the unsaturated omegas for access to the brain, you should keep your intake of saturated animal fats low. By using olive oil rather than butter when cooking, not combining cheese with fish dishes and spreading only a little butter on your toast or bread when preparing a tuna sandwich, you'll be assisting the fish oils to carry out their healing processes. </p> <p>Although concerns have been raised about the levels of dioxin that they contain, it appears that the benefits of eating oily fish far outweigh the potentially slight risk to health of consuming small amounts of this pollutant. One of the most useful aspects of the oily fish scenario is that tinned fish can be just as beneficial as the fresh varieties, which can sometimes be hard to buy or unappetising to cook. Whatever source you prefer, aim to eat two to three servings of oily fish a week. </p> <p>All in all, oily fish is both impressively versatile and provides a plethora of health benefits. Not only should you eat it, but I advise that you introduce your children to it as soon as you can, giving them small amounts at a time and perhaps disguising its taste in mayonnaise or a pasta sauce. If you do so, you'll be building up their bodies to lead a healthy life.</p>",

Two distinct days, both funky. Saturday is an electronic dance festival headlined inevitably by local DJ deity Fatboy Slim. Sunday is more intriguing, featuring the multifarious talents of Talvin Singh, Flavor Flav, Beenie Man, Angie Stone and the legendary James Brown. Close to the seaside too.

Said by aficionados to be the friendliest and most fun of all the festivals, the World of Music and Dance festival is steadily shedding its reputation as an earnest, middle-class bongo session, and is now the most eclectic of all. Khaled, Youssou N'Dour and Suzanne Vega headline, and there's a creche too.

Trancey, vibey kinda festival for people who've had enough of dehydrating on dodgy white powder in pricey, overpopulated clubs and prefer to roll a spliff and listen to the likes of Nitin Sawhney, DJ Lovegrove and Biosphere in a rural idyll.

      "body": "<p>When P&amp;O announced its long-awaited plan to demerge its cruising business in February, it pointed to the superior valuation of Carnival, its US cruising rival, to justify the move. </p> <p>Last week, Carnival warned that it is having to offer discounts in order to fill ships, which means its earnings for 2000 will be only 'slightly higher' than last year's. Surprise, surprise, P&amp;O is now stressing the differences between its cruise operation and Carnival's, rather than claiming they should be similarly valued. </p> <p>There is some justification for this. Its ships are newer than Carnival's, so it can justify higher rates. It is less exposed to the fiercely competitive Caribbean market than the US operator. And forward bookings are good, albeit lower than the millennium-boosted levels seen at the end of 1999. </p> <p>But Carnival's profits warning is also a sign of how fast the market can change. As recently as April, it was predicting earnings growth for this year as high as 10 per cent. The City fears that P&amp;O's optimism will also soon prove misplaced. </p> <p>Carnival's warning vindicates those who predicted that cruising profits would be undermined by the number of new ships being launched almost monthly. P&amp;O's insistence that it is just meeting growing demand is supported by past results, where a 50 per cent increase in capacity of its flagship Princess fleet has produced a 64 per cent increase in operating profits. </p> <p>But the City is worried that supply and demand could now tip the wrong way. The cruising market does look healthy; the number of people going on cruises has been rising at 7.9 per cent a year in the US and even faster in the rest of the world. Given an ageing - and increasingly wealthy - population, and the fact that cruising still represents less than 2 per cent of the holiday market, predictions that it will continue to grow at that rate look reasonable. </p> <p>But, sooner or later, the sharp rise in the number of ships will catch up with the growth in demand for a holiday on the sea. The City fears that time is fast-approaching - which, given that the industry will add another 35 per cent to capacity by 2003, is not comforting news. The City is already factoring a deceleration in growth into P&amp;O's forecasts. Deutsche Bank, for example, predicts flat operating profits for the cruise division, despite a 23 per cent rise in capacity. </p> <p>Whether that is too pessimistic will not be clear for another six months or so. What is certain is that, unless Carnival stages a sharp turnaround, the valuation of P&amp;O Princess - as the cruising business will be known - when it floats in October will be far less now than it would have been three months ago. P&amp;O may be in better shape than Carnival, and may command a premium rating, but that is likely to put P&amp;O on perhaps 20 times earnings, not the 50 times Carnival once commanded. </p> <p>The 10 per cent fall in its shares last week, which has left them at little over half their value at the beginning of the year, discounts too much bad news. The unkindly named 'P&amp;O rump', including ferries and transport, will be attractive in its own right, albeit without the glamour of the cruising side. A valuation of 670p a share for the combined business is not unreasonable. Throg Street has long been a fan of the shares and, at their current level, they look cheap. But buyers should expect them to remain volatile at least until demerger. </p> <p><strong> Under offer</strong><br> What should managers do when someone makes an offer for their company? The obvious answer is to inform shareholders and let them decide whether or not to accept. Shareholders are, after all, the owners of the business and they should get the chance to decide whether to accept the offer - particularly if it is at a 50 per cent premium to the share price. </p> <p>But what if you think the offer, premium or no, undervalues the business? And what if the prospective bidder is an existing shareholder, and you suspect it is simply trying to flush out another buyer so that it can sell its stake for a tidy profit? </p> <p>Christian Salvesen, the transport business, found itself in just that position when Swedish investment group Custos approached it with a 180p-a-share offer. It decided shareholders did not need to know about the bid and turned it down flat. Not surprisingly, Custos did not want to leave it there and duly announced its interest to the market. Salvesen's view that the offer was too low was vindicated by the shares, which leapt to 185p, and by analysts' predictions that the company could be worth as much as 250p a share. </p> <p>But if Custos, which has been a shareholder only since August and whose purchase price was probably about 100p a share, wants to flush out a buyer, what about the other shareholders - many of whom will have been around a lot longer, and who could have paid up to 40 per cent more than Custos for their shares. And while Salvesen's management may think 180p is too low, the City appears not to agree. Shares have not touched that level for at least five years - indeed, they were less than half that a year ago. </p> <p>In fact, Custos insists it is not simply courting a bid. It thinks that the logistics business is ripe for consolidation into a small number of pan-European companies. It believes Salvesen is well placed to take advantage of that. Or it would be if it had the financial firepower. Custos has backing from venture capitalist Doughty Hanson, which means it has up to \u00a31 billion to spend. And it wants Salvesen's existing management to help it do so. </p> <p>The interesting question for Salvesen's other shareholders is where do we go from here? The company has been top of everyone's list of bid targets since the one from British rival Hays failed three years ago, but predators have been thin on the ground. Perhaps they have been deterred by the 35 per cent shareholding still in the hands of the founding family - whose implacable opposition caused the failure of the Hays bid. Or perhaps they think that, if they wait long enough, they would win Salvesen's customers by default. Salvesen may claim that it has a \u00a3150 million war chest, but that would not be enough to take it decisively into Europe. </p> <p>Recent escapes by Wickes and Blue Circle show that the City may not think old-economy companies worth much, but that does not mean it will sell to anyone cheap. If Custos is serious about acquiring, it will have to pay a bit more. But it will still leave Salvesen vulnerable to a trade buyer. Shareholders should sit tight and enjoy the ride.</p>",

Buying travel products requires no wearing, holding, touching, tasting or feeling. It is weightless - based entirely on information and availability. And it is one sector that is forging ahead. Battle lines are being drawn for the anticipated 'shakeout' of smaller firms. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.easyjet.com\" target=\"_new\">EasyJet</a>, the budget airline, sold 72.1 per cent of its flights over the internet in the week to last Monday. In both the US and Europe, rival airlines have joined forces to launch consumer sites later this year. Meanwhile e-tailers such as <a href=\"http://www.ebookers.com\" target=\"_new\">Ebookers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.expedia.com\" target=\"_new\">Expedia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\" target=\"_new\">Lastminute</a> compete with a multitude of smaller sites and the airlines' own websites. </p> <p>Even after the recent market jitters about business-to-consumer (b2c) sites, e-travel remains a favoured area. Merrill Lynch predicts a $32 billion European market by 2004, and analysts at the Gartner Group predict a sixfold increase in revenues by the end of next year, to $30bn. </p> <p>Online travel agencies are still receiving funding, which has dried up in other b2c sectors since April's market correction. The collapse of Lastminute.com's share price signalled the market's worries at that point. Now the structure of the sector is set for a consolidation. Ebookers, the London-based, Europewide company, is running out of cash, but conditions for raising fresh funds are far from rosy. </p> <p>The market for e-travel is clearly strong, but investors are uncertain which horses to back. The key question is whether net-savvy consumers value the independent guidance of one-stop portals such as Expedia and lastminute. com, or whether are they going straight to the airline. </p> <p>The answers may lie in a glut of research on consumer behaviour in the market over the Atlantic. The Travel Industry of America's report, Travelers' use of the Internet , makes for interesting reading. The number of people using the internet to book airline tickets or hotel accommodation jumped by 146 per cent to 16.5 million. About 35 million used the internet to research travel plans before using other methods to purchase tickets; some 52.2 million used the internet at some point for making plans.There are opportunities both in the sale of travel products and in the provision of information. </p> <p>But here is the rub; just over half of buyers purchase directly from airline or accommodation sites. Independent portals account for 39 per cent. </p> <p>By the end of the year, Orbitz - the US collaboration between airlines American, Delta, United, Northwest and Continental - and the unnamed European effort now being constructed by McKinsey, will be trading. The stock market panned Lastminute and Ebookers after these announcements. But the travel market is somewhat more complex than the brutal calculus of internet analysts will allow. </p> <p>The airline collaborations will sell only 'published fares'. These are airline-branded tickets that are rarely sold at discount, but whose availability is published on central reservation systems. You can get on the same flight more cheaply by purchasing a 'negotiated' fare. Such bargains are branded not by the airline, but by a travel agent such as Ebookers. The agent can mix and match outward and return portions. </p> <p>Airlines can thus discount their seats without affecting their valuable brands. Travel agents need to be 'bonded' in each country in which they wish to sell negotiated fares, and need to develop direct relationships with airlines. </p> <p>The introduction of Orbitz and its European airline-owned equivalent should only affect sales of published fares. The rationale for having negotiated fares does not diminish. Most importantly, competition authorities will watch very carefully to see whether the airline-owned venture is treated any differently. The US Department of Justice is already investigating Orbitz.So unless there is a change in the regulatory environment, the airline-owned portals will not affect travel agent discounters. </p> <p>Moreover, the entire sector will have to compete on factors other than price. The process of booking a flight or holiday over the internet can be fiddly and frustrating. Strong content will complement ease of use. United Airlines has signed a deal with <a href=\"http://www.On2.com\" target=\"_new\">On2.com</a>, a leader in broadband content. The strategic alliance will co-develop what they claim will be 'the first travel website featuring television-quality travel videos'. Something for the future, perhaps, but it illustrates long-term plans that recognise the need for consumer content. </p> <p>Leading guidebook brands such as Fodor's, Rough Guide and Time Out are owners of key content and could help draw customers to sites. </p> <p>The industry lends itself well to mobile commerce. Ebookers, Lastminute and <a href=\"http://www.thomascook.com\" target=\"_new\">Thomas Cook</a> have signed a number of deals with European mobile phone operators to provide Wap-based services. A website will be able to locate an individual mobile phone and give tailored information on trains, perhaps with a seat-booking facility. </p> <p>Such visions will require more funding, alternative sources of revenue, strategic partnerships and mergers. Thanks to the savage marketing costs required by b2c, sites are burning the piles of cash gleaned from investors. Ebookers, Europe's biggest e-travel agent, is said to have just two calendar quarters of cash left. Other sites have seen their plans to fund expansion dashed by the market correction. </p> <p>Ebookers says its business plan envisaged a need to raise further funds at the end of 2000. The question for investors is exactly what the original money was spent on. In this instance, it has funded a unique network of strongholds - call centres and access to negotiated fares - in 11 European countries. It is a localised presence that should increase the quality of information, and therefore content, for the website. Analysts say the firm, listed on Nasdaq and Germany's Neuer Markt, will need to show that its disparate European purchases have been integrated into the company. </p> <p>Not all e-travel agents have similarly objectified their spending, and they may suffer, particularly if investors foresee that company being among those 'shaken out'. </p> <p>In the US, consolidation has begun. Travelocity, 70 per cent owned by Sabre, recently bought Preview Travel. The number two site, Expedia, 80 per cent owned by Microsoft, acquired discount hotel sites travelscape.com and VacationSpot.com to expand its selection of hotel rooms. </p> <p>Last month, lastminute. com signed a deal with Expedia.co.uk making Lastminute the exclusive provider of late booking offers. Expedia offers booking for travel deals no later than 72 hours in advance, so the two companies complement each other . </p> <p>In the new deal, Lastminute will provide the company's first-range deals, including flights, holidays, restaurant and theatre bookings. It is the natural development of an 18-month-long partnership, but it bodes ill for players without Lastminute's high profile or the backing of a giant such as Microsoft. Smaller players are likely to be squeezed out if they do not find a niche. </p> <p>The launch of another b2c site, <a href=\"HTTP://www.ifyoutravel.com\" target=\"_new\">ifyoutravel.com</a>, may not seem the best ideas. The question is not so much if you travel, but who you use.</p>",

Most importantly, competition authorities will watch very carefully to see whether the airline-owned venture is treated any differently. The US Department of Justice is already investigating Orbitz.So unless there is a change in the regulatory environment, the airline-owned portals will not affect travel agent discounters. Moreover, the entire sector will have to compete on factors other than price. The process of booking a flight or holiday over the internet can be fiddly and frustrating. Strong content will complement ease of use. United Airlines has signed a deal with On2.com, a leader in broadband content. The strategic alliance will co-develop what they claim will be 'the first travel website featuring television-quality travel videos'. Something for the future, perhaps, but it illustrates long-term plans that recognise the need for consumer content. Leading guidebook brands such as Fodor's, Rough Guide and Time Out are owners of key content and could help draw customers to sites. The industry lends itself well to mobile commerce. Ebookers, Lastminute and Thomas Cook have signed a number of deals with European mobile phone operators to provide Wap-based services. A website will be able to locate an individual mobile phone and give tailored information on trains, perhaps with a seat-booking facility. Such visions will require more funding, alternative sources of revenue, strategic partnerships and mergers. Thanks to the savage marketing costs required by b2c, sites are burning the piles of cash gleaned from investors. Ebookers, Europe's biggest e-travel agent, is said to have just two calendar quarters of cash left. Other sites have seen their plans to fund expansion dashed by the market correction. Ebookers says its business plan envisaged a need to raise further funds at the end of 2000. The question for investors is exactly what the original money was spent on. In this instance, it has funded a unique network of strongholds - call centres and access to negotiated fares - in 11 European countries. It is a localised presence that should increase the quality of information, and therefore content, for the website. Analysts say the firm, listed on Nasdaq and Germany's Neuer Markt, will need to show that its disparate European purchases have been integrated into the company. Not all e-travel agents have similarly objectified their spending, and they may suffer, particularly if investors foresee that company being among those 'shaken out'. In the US, consolidation has begun. Travelocity, 70 per cent owned by Sabre, recently bought Preview Travel. The number two site, Expedia, 80 per cent owned by Microsoft, acquired discount hotel sites travelscape.com and VacationSpot.com to expand its selection of hotel rooms. Last month, lastminute. com signed a deal with Expedia.co.uk making Lastminute the exclusive provider of late booking offers. Expedia offers booking for travel deals no later than 72 hours in advance, so the two companies complement each other . In the new deal, Lastminute will provide the company's first-range deals, including flights, holidays, restaurant and theatre bookings. It is the natural development of an 18-month-long partnership, but it bodes ill for players without Lastminute's high profile or the backing of a giant such as Microsoft. Smaller players are likely to be squeezed out if they do not find a niche. The launch of another b2c site, ifyoutravel.com, may not seem the best ideas. The question is not so much if you travel, but who you use.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Are we witnessing the death of the high street, with hundreds of empty shops blighting our towns and cities? </p> <p>It looks that way. After all, wafer-thin margins and rising shop rents have seen the quoted retail sector lose over 30 per cent of its value over the past two years. </p> <p>The demise of the mid-range clothing market, squeezed out by designer label shops at one end and aggressive discounters at the other, this month forced C&amp;A to pull out of Britain, with the loss of 5,000 jobs. Arcadia last April announced it was shutting down its loss-making Principles for Men chain. </p> <p>The Queen Mother of retailing, Marks &amp; Spencer, which last week stunned its competitors when it became the first major retailer to launch its summer sale, last year issued profit warnings, while Storehouse's former jewel, BHS, was last month sold to retailing axe man Philip Green for \u00a3200 million - peanuts compared with what the chain was worth in its heyday. </p> <p>Speculation as to who the next major casualty will be is rife. Arcadia, owner of Warehouse, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins and Burton among many others, is under most pressure. Analysts believe the success of women's clothing shops such as Zara and Mango from Spain plus New Look puts Arcadia in a tough position. </p> <p>The malaise is compounded by slow consumer spending while prices on essential items fall. The British Retail Consortium's most recent price index, three weeks ago, recorded year-on-year price deflation of 1.1 per cent - the 13th successive monthly decrease. </p> <p>'While deflation in the high street is great news for customers, retailers are seeing margins squeezed at the same time as pressure is applied to their operating costs,' said BRC's Mark Bradshaw. </p> <p>It all paints a gloomy picture for retailers. But anyone who thinks we are watching the high street's demise is wide of the mark. </p> <p>Instead, what's happening is polarisation in every facet of this industry. These days, top multiples are interested in only about 300 high streets and shopping malls. Strong provincial city centres such as Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham and sprawling out-of-town centres such as Bluewater and Meadowhall are where they want to be. </p> <p>To display wider product ranges, major chains are demanding large units, which they cannot get in the smaller high streets. </p> <p>Next, for instance, now sells sofas, bedlinen and other homeware items as well as its staple line of clothes for thirtysomethings. It has 300 stores nationwide and has spent the past decade upping its floorspace. </p> <p>'We need to increase the amount of products on the shelves,' said a Next spokesman. 'We're aiming for additional space as opposed to additional stores.' </p> <p>Suburban towns could provide larger units were it not for fragmented ownership of high street shop units. Only when high streets are owned by a single entity can shops be 'knocked through' to create these larger units. </p> <p>Greg Nicholson, head of investment at property consultant CB Hillier Parker, recently bought a parade of shops in Oxford city centre for Boots. The pharmacy wanted a large - 30,000 sq ft - unit. It took two years to achieve its aim. </p> <p>Likewise Nicholson's firm has overseen the makeover of London's Regent Street. He says it was possible to create large units only because the Crown owns the whole street. 'Shopping centres can manage their space easily. They can buy out leases because they are owned or managed by a single party. Regent Street shops were historically treated separately, but we've applied a shopping-centre- style management. It's worked. We now have 17 major international retailers in there.' </p> <p>Recent surveys have revealed that 80 per cent of this country's retail spend is concentrated in 20 per cent of all available space. So if there is a dash for malls and major city and town centres, where does that leave the 1,200 high streets in this country which don't figure in the multiples' 'grand scheme'? </p> <p>According to top retail consultant Clive Vaughan of Retail Intelligence, the excluded must either become centres of convenience or encourage leisure uses with restaurants, cafes and gyms. 'The ones that are left clearly need to find a role. Some places will just feature convenience shops, a food store, a chemist, a newsagent and little else,' he said </p> <p>Dorking in Surrey is one town that has thrived in its role as a secondary centre. True, it is has a relatively wealthy commuter population and is surrounded by attractive countryside. But the town has for the past few years seen an exodus of major chains. Facing town centre oblivion, Dorking has reinvented itself as a focus for independent traders combined with top- notch restaurants. </p> <p>'Dorking realised three or four years ago that retail polarisation was happening,' says its town manager, Simon Matthews. 'What we did was to flip the whole thing round. We have a traditional linear high street, with 300 small units. Most majors wanted big units. We decided to go for the independents, and now 80 per cent of our shops are run by them. We've got wine merchants and thriving restaurants here.' </p> <p>Matthews concedes that his job would be tougher if he had to manage a less prosperous town, but maintains it is not impossible to revive town centre high streets. 'You have to create a brand and play up all your advantages,' he said. </p> <p>Easy in Dorking. Much harder in depressed parts of the country. But with people prepared to travel further to shop and spend the whole day in retail therapy, Britain's secondary towns have very little choice. </p> <p><strong>Shops till he drops: The British Land gamble</strong><br> John Ritblat, the colourful 64-year-old chairman of British Land, is viewed as the supreme real estate deal-maker of his generation. </p> <p>But the next 10 days will decide whether history will view the pugnacious Ritblat - owner of the Broadgate office complex next to Liverpool Street station - as Britain's biggest shopping-centre landlord or as a nearly man who failed to give his shareholders a decent return on their investment. </p> <p>Ritblat is in the midst of an intense war for 29.9 per cent of Liberty International shares. Liberty, a listed property company, is controlled by 70-year-old South African billionaire Donald Gordon, who built up his worldwide property empire from nothing. Liberty's main investment is a 75 per cent stake in Capital Shopping Centres - the UK's most powerful shopping-centre landlord. CSC's eight regional shopping centres include the Metro Centre in Gateshead and Lakeside in Essex. </p> <p>Ritblat owns the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield. He bought it last year for \u00a31.2 billion from Eddie Healey and Paul Sykes. Ritblat's intention is to create the biggest shopping-centre group in the country. An eventual demerger from British Land is predicted by analysts. </p> <p>It seems strange that at a time when the retail sector is going through the mill, Ritblat wants to go long on retail property. But analysts agree that Ritblat's strategy is cute. </p> <p>'Shopping centres were one of the fastest growing sectors in property until two years ago,' said one. 'But growth has slowed recently because rents have reached a plateau. But there is no doubt that, in the long term, the massive centres will become more valuable because government planning laws limit the building of new centres and the demand for space in them is such that eventually rents will have to reflect this.' </p> <p>But Liberty's Gordon is desperate to protect his company. He has offered to trump Ritblat's bid for the shares - a mix of cash and paper valuing the 29.9 per cent stake at 520p a share - by offering an all-cash bid at 575p. </p> <p>But the bank that sold Ritblat the 29.9 per cent stake, South Africa's Standard Bank, has entered into a legally binding agreement with Ritblat. Breaking that agreement would cost Standard \u00a315 million. </p> <p>This brings the differential between the two bids down. Standard's decision to sell still requires shareholder approval. The likelihood is Standard shareholders will vote to reject Ritblat's offer, knowing a bigger bid lies in the wings. The only thing Ritblat can do is up his bid and convert it into cash. </p> <p>Ritblat is poised to do this at a time when his company is being slated by shareholders for failing to deliver - its share price has lost 25 per cent in the past 12 months. In addition, it has gearing at 122 per cent. </p> <p>If Ritblat misses out on Liberty and CSC, it will be a sign that the wily old fox of British property has run out of puff. The man who has spent his career chasing deals could turn into the quarry. </p> <p><strong> Forget food and footwear - it's all fast cars and feng shui</strong></p> <p>The declining role of the state, increasing inequality, and the emergence of new technology are keys to shifting patterns of consumer spending, writes Faisal Islam. </p> <p> As the state slowly rolls back from provision of social services, individuals are diverting spending towards private healthcare, pensions and sometimes education. </p> <p>Financial services have gained over the past 10 years. Indeed seven of the nine sectors that have seen the largest percentage point increase in household expenditure are related to either finance or leisure. </p> <p> A report from consumer analyst Mintel says the total spent on financial services and pensions in 1999 was \u00a3101billion, up from \u00a354bn in 1989, representing an increase in the share of household spending from 12.8 per cent to 15.1 per cent. </p> <p>Education fees and charity saw the fourth-largest growth in share of spending. Medical services are also in the top 10 sectors over the past decade. There has been a 30 per cent increase in self-pay operations over the past three years. </p> <p>A shift towards buying services rather than goods will see greater tendency for price increases, because wages are more inflationary than goods. </p> <p>The shift in consumption patterns also reflects increasing inequality of incomes since the Seventies. Some of that is due to the emergence of a split between two-earner and no-earner households. </p> <p>As incomes increase, consumers will spend little more on inferior goods such as food and clothing. They will spend their wealth on luxuries - second cars, third holidays and feng shui consultants. </p> <p>In the clothing sector the past decade has seen a boom in sales of designer clothing. At the other end discount stores such as Matalan have also been successful. 'It is the mainstream middle ground - C&amp;A, BHS and Marks &amp; Spencer - that is suffering,' says Neil Mason of Mintel. </p> <p>Shifts in social attitudes to activities such as gardening and home decorating are a recent phenomenon. 'DIY and electricals are taking a bigger share of the retail cake; clothing is losing that share,' says Richard Hyman of Verdict Research. </p> <p>Consumers are also spending their money on a raft of expensive new technologies that were not around a decade ago, such as mobile phones and the internet. Households now subscribe to television channels and also pay-per-view. The large-scale entry of women to the labour market over the past three decades and consequent lifestyle changes have also affected spending.

      "bodyText": "Are we witnessing the death of the high street, with hundreds of empty shops blighting our towns and cities? It looks that way. After all, wafer-thin margins and rising shop rents have seen the quoted retail sector lose over 30 per cent of its value over the past two years. The demise of the mid-range clothing market, squeezed out by designer label shops at one end and aggressive discounters at the other, this month forced C&amp;A to pull out of Britain, with the loss of 5,000 jobs. Arcadia last April announced it was shutting down its loss-making Principles for Men chain. The Queen Mother of retailing, Marks &amp; Spencer, which last week stunned its competitors when it became the first major retailer to launch its summer sale, last year issued profit warnings, while Storehouse's former jewel, BHS, was last month sold to retailing axe man Philip Green for \u00a3200 million - peanuts compared with what the chain was worth in its heyday. Speculation as to who the next major casualty will be is rife. Arcadia, owner of Warehouse, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins and Burton among many others, is under most pressure. Analysts believe the success of women's clothing shops such as Zara and Mango from Spain plus New Look puts Arcadia in a tough position. The malaise is compounded by slow consumer spending while prices on essential items fall. The British Retail Consortium's most recent price index, three weeks ago, recorded year-on-year price deflation of 1.1 per cent - the 13th successive monthly decrease. 'While deflation in the high street is great news for customers, retailers are seeing margins squeezed at the same time as pressure is applied to their operating costs,' said BRC's Mark Bradshaw. It all paints a gloomy picture for retailers. But anyone who thinks we are watching the high street's demise is wide of the mark. Instead, what's happening is polarisation in every facet of this industry. These days, top multiples are interested in only about 300 high streets and shopping malls. Strong provincial city centres such as Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham and sprawling out-of-town centres such as Bluewater and Meadowhall are where they want to be. To display wider product ranges, major chains are demanding large units, which they cannot get in the smaller high streets. Next, for instance, now sells sofas, bedlinen and other homeware items as well as its staple line of clothes for thirtysomethings. It has 300 stores nationwide and has spent the past decade upping its floorspace. 'We need to increase the amount of products on the shelves,' said a Next spokesman. 'We're aiming for additional space as opposed to additional stores.' Suburban towns could provide larger units were it not for fragmented ownership of high street shop units. Only when high streets are owned by a single entity can shops be 'knocked through' to create these larger units. Greg Nicholson, head of investment at property consultant CB Hillier Parker, recently bought a parade of shops in Oxford city centre for Boots. The pharmacy wanted a large - 30,000 sq ft - unit. It took two years to achieve its aim. Likewise Nicholson's firm has overseen the makeover of London's Regent Street. He says it was possible to create large units only because the Crown owns the whole street. 'Shopping centres can manage their space easily. They can buy out leases because they are owned or managed by a single party. Regent Street shops were historically treated separately, but we've applied a shopping-centre- style management. It's worked. We now have 17 major international retailers in there.' Recent surveys have revealed that 80 per cent of this country's retail spend is concentrated in 20 per cent of all available space. So if there is a dash for malls and major city and town centres, where does that leave the 1,200 high streets in this country which don't figure in the multiples' 'grand scheme'? According to top retail consultant Clive Vaughan of Retail Intelligence, the excluded must either become centres of convenience or encourage leisure uses with restaurants, cafes and gyms. 'The ones that are left clearly need to find a role. Some places will just feature convenience shops, a food store, a chemist, a newsagent and little else,' he said Dorking in Surrey is one town that has thrived in its role as a secondary centre. True, it is has a relatively wealthy commuter population and is surrounded by attractive countryside. But the town has for the past few years seen an exodus of major chains. Facing town centre oblivion, Dorking has reinvented itself as a focus for independent traders combined with top- notch restaurants. 'Dorking realised three or four years ago that retail polarisation was happening,' says its town manager, Simon Matthews. 'What we did was to flip the whole thing round. We have a traditional linear high street, with 300 small units. Most majors wanted big units. We decided to go for the independents, and now 80 per cent of our shops are run by them. We've got wine merchants and thriving restaurants here.' Matthews concedes that his job would be tougher if he had to manage a less prosperous town, but maintains it is not impossible to revive town centre high streets. 'You have to create a brand and play up all your advantages,' he said. Easy in Dorking. Much harder in depressed parts of the country. But with people prepared to travel further to shop and spend the whole day in retail therapy, Britain's secondary towns have very little choice. Shops till he drops: The British Land gamble John Ritblat, the colourful 64-year-old chairman of British Land, is viewed as the supreme real estate deal-maker of his generation. But the next 10 days will decide whether history will view the pugnacious Ritblat - owner of the Broadgate office complex next to Liverpool Street station - as Britain's biggest shopping-centre landlord or as a nearly man who failed to give his shareholders a decent return on their investment. Ritblat is in the midst of an intense war for 29.9 per cent of Liberty International shares. Liberty, a listed property company, is controlled by 70-year-old South African billionaire Donald Gordon, who built up his worldwide property empire from nothing. Liberty's main investment is a 75 per cent stake in Capital Shopping Centres - the UK's most powerful shopping-centre landlord. CSC's eight regional shopping centres include the Metro Centre in Gateshead and Lakeside in Essex. Ritblat owns the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield. He bought it last year for \u00a31.2 billion from Eddie Healey and Paul Sykes. Ritblat's intention is to create the biggest shopping-centre group in the country. An eventual demerger from British Land is predicted by analysts. It seems strange that at a time when the retail sector is going through the mill, Ritblat wants to go long on retail property. But analysts agree that Ritblat's strategy is cute. 'Shopping centres were one of the fastest growing sectors in property until two years ago,' said one. 'But growth has slowed recently because rents have reached a plateau. But there is no doubt that, in the long term, the massive centres will become more valuable because government planning laws limit the building of new centres and the demand for space in them is such that eventually rents will have to reflect this.' But Liberty's Gordon is desperate to protect his company. He has offered to trump Ritblat's bid for the shares - a mix of cash and paper valuing the 29.9 per cent stake at 520p a share - by offering an all-cash bid at 575p. But the bank that sold Ritblat the 29.9 per cent stake, South Africa's Standard Bank, has entered into a legally binding agreement with Ritblat. Breaking that agreement would cost Standard \u00a315 million. This brings the differential between the two bids down. Standard's decision to sell still requires shareholder approval. The likelihood is Standard shareholders will vote to reject Ritblat's offer, knowing a bigger bid lies in the wings. The only thing Ritblat can do is up his bid and convert it into cash. Ritblat is poised to do this at a time when his company is being slated by shareholders for failing to deliver - its share price has lost 25 per cent in the past 12 months. In addition, it has gearing at 122 per cent. If Ritblat misses out on Liberty and CSC, it will be a sign that the wily old fox of British property has run out of puff. The man who has spent his career chasing deals could turn into the quarry. Forget food and footwear - it's all fast cars and feng shui The declining role of the state, increasing inequality, and the emergence of new technology are keys to shifting patterns of consumer spending, writes Faisal Islam. As the state slowly rolls back from provision of social services, individuals are diverting spending towards private healthcare, pensions and sometimes education. Financial services have gained over the past 10 years. Indeed seven of the nine sectors that have seen the largest percentage point increase in household expenditure are related to either finance or leisure. A report from consumer analyst Mintel says the total spent on financial services and pensions in 1999 was \u00a3101billion, up from \u00a354bn in 1989, representing an increase in the share of household spending from 12.8 per cent to 15.1 per cent. Education fees and charity saw the fourth-largest growth in share of spending. Medical services are also in the top 10 sectors over the past decade. There has been a 30 per cent increase in self-pay operations over the past three years. A shift towards buying services rather than goods will see greater tendency for price increases, because wages are more inflationary than goods. The shift in consumption patterns also reflects increasing inequality of incomes since the Seventies. Some of that is due to the emergence of a split between two-earner and no-earner households. As incomes increase, consumers will spend little more on inferior goods such as food and clothing. They will spend their wealth on luxuries - second cars, third holidays and feng shui consultants. In the clothing sector the past decade has seen a boom in sales of designer clothing. At the other end discount stores such as Matalan have also been successful. 'It is the mainstream middle ground - C&amp;A, BHS and Marks &amp; Spencer - that is suffering,' says Neil Mason of Mintel. Shifts in social attitudes to activities such as gardening and home decorating are a recent phenomenon. 'DIY and electricals are taking a bigger share of the retail cake; clothing is losing that share,' says Richard Hyman of Verdict Research. Consumers are also spending their money on a raft of expensive new technologies that were not around a decade ago, such as mobile phones and the internet. Households now subscribe to television channels and also pay-per-view. The large-scale entry of women to the labour market over the past three decades and consequent lifestyle changes have also affected spending. Women are not having as many children or starting their families as early as they did in the past. The average woman has her first child at 29. Such trends have left an increasing concentration of wealth in the hands of childless, but wealthy couples. 'The money that may have been spent on essentials, such as food and clothing for children,' says Sarah Smith of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, 'might now be spent on fast cars and adventure holidays.'",

Walmsley doubts whether he could be persuaded. Like his views on warships, his views on takeovers indicate an unwillingness to be thoroughly commercial. As for his willingness to refashion the MoD from within so that it can equip UK forces better, we can but wait and see.",

To rousing effect. Gregory Doran has directed a cast of over a hundred actors, only one of whom - the impressive Ray Stevenson who plays Jesus - is employed professionally. The finely snarling Herod (Tim Holman) practises law in Harrogate; God - the clarion-voiced John M. Hall - is a teacher and a golfer. </p> <p>A specially built stage rises in tiers, with the Minster's pale gothic arches receding above. When Noah sees his rainbow, the chancel vaulting is flushed with stripes of candy-coloured lights. Before the Passion, lighting transforms the pallor of the Minster's stone and the matching oatmeal-coloured garments of the crowd: everything turns the colour of terracotta, as if someone had administered a blood transfusion. It's hard to imagine a more potent combination of setting and play. </p> <p>The evening is only intermittently holy, and rarely an advertisement for Christian kindness. At the beginning of the evening, when a growling chord rang through the building, half the audience rose to its feet, believing it to be the National Anthem, played in honour of the Duke of York who was present. When they realised it was merely announcing the voice of God, they sat down again quick. In the manner of the Mysteries - and of cathedrals - this is an occasion made up of harshness, worldliness and domestic life, as well as elevation. </p> <p>The devotion of the Nativity is beautifully spelt out: the stable's arch is a homely version of the Minster's magnificent gold-knotted gothic; a bemused Joseph - spotting that Mary has given birth - inquires: 'What is that sweet thing on thy knee?' But there can be few episodes less compassionate than this terrifyingly staged Last Judgment. In the darkness, everyone gathers, holding a light aloft, waiting to know their fate. When an intransigent Christ casts his vote, the damned let out a desolate gasp; as the elect go upwards with burning candles, the lights of the discarded are snuffed out in the basement. </p> <p>Doran and his designer Robert Jones do not like leaving well alone. The Creation scene - which brings the colours of the Minster's stained glass on to the stage - is too busy.

A huge, beautiful space has been populated. Twenty-first century technology has helped: a microphone concealed in a staff has become known as 'the thirteenth apostle', but the most penetrating moments would have been recognised in the fourteenth century. The Flood is conjured up by rippling huge blue sheets across the steps, while little faces peep anxiously from the windows of Noah's Ark.

And now Jude Kelly's production of <strong> Singin' in the Rain</strong> - premiered last year at West Yorkshire Playhouse - has arrived at the Olivier, fresh and bubbling and a hit. </p> <p>In directing a theatrical homage to a film which is itself a homage to the screen, Kelly does what the theatre can and film can't do: she includes scenes from both screen and stage. Big video screens project a variety of images around the actors as they caper and sing. Excerpts from black-and-white movies are seen, first as grainy, mouthing dumb shows, and later cracklingly supplied with soundtracks in which the turning of a page explodes like a forest fire.

      "body": "<p><strong> The Next Best Thing</strong> (12, 109 mins) Directed by John Schlesinger; starring Madonna, Rupert Everett </p> <p><strong> Deception</strong> (15, 104mins) Directed by John Frankenheimer; starring Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron </p> <p><strong> Chill Factor</strong> (15, 102mins) Directed by Hugh Johnson; starring Cuba Gooding Jr, Skeet Ulrich, Peter Firth </p> <p><strong> Isn't She Great</strong> (15, 100mins) Directed by Andrew Bergman; starring Bette Midler, Nathan Lane </p> <p><strong> Jaya Ganga</strong> (85mins) Directed by Vijay Singh; starring Asil Rais, Smriti Mishra </p> <p><strong> Big Momma's House</strong> (12, 108mins) Directed by Raja Gosnell; starring Martin Lawrence, Nia Long </p> <p><strong> Relative Values</strong> (PG, 90mins) Directed by Eric Styles; starring Julie Andrews, William Baldwin </p> <p><strong> Brothers</strong> (15, 90 mins) Directed by Martin Dunkerton; starring Justin Brett, Daren Jacobs </p> <p>What, if you're finally fed up with football, is the next best thing? Alas, it can't be <strong> The Next Best Thing</strong>, Madonna's umpteenth shot at building a steady acting career. She's a thirtysomething yoga teacher with a ticking biological clock. A transplanted English gardener, Rupert Everett, is her super gay chum. One drink-sodden night, they sleep together and along comes baby Sammy. Can Rupert be a true father? Five happy years would seem to indicate so, but then Madonna falls for a hunky investment banker (Benjamin Bratt) who wants to move her and the young 'un to New York, and Rupert demands his parental rights. What seemed to begin as frothy comedy turns bewilderingly to heavy-duty court melodrama. </p> <p>John Schlesinger's directing days of wine and Oscars are long gone. The sour precision of Darling and the freshness of America observed in Midnight Cowboy have left him. He can bring nothing but a surface competence to this very odd party. Though Everett has moments, he is essentially required to do his Julia Roberts's ex-best friend turn with tragedy added. And does Hollywood tackle the gay rights issue? On the contrary, Hollywood squishes round to happyish ending that anxiously smothers any rights in pink ribbon. The best thing by far is Madonna, here cast as an identifiable human being possessed of warmth and some feelings. This mellow makeover, from the eternal mistress of the makeover, suits her well. Pop star images always need changing but movie star images have to work a narrower patch. Who knows, she may even be playing herself at last. </p> <p>From the slumping of Schlesinger to the fading of Frankenheimer. The Manchurian Candidate was the sharp-edged stuff of political history; <strong> Deception</strong> - 38 years later - is the detritus of directing history. Ben Affleck, looking like a bemused honours graduate who's strayed off campus, is an ex-con who gets mistaken for another ex-con by a gang bent on casino robbery. Charlize Theron, a baby doll in miniskirts to freeze your legs off during this Michigan winter, is a mystery moll. Gary Sinise does his manic villain act from memory. The film-makers (apart from changing the title from Reindeer Games at the last minute - always a dodgy sign) enter a ritual plea not to give the plot away. Master, I obey. Nobody could give away a plot like this because nobody would want to. All concerned twist in the freezing wind. </p> <p>By contrast, <strong> Chill Factor</strong> seems almost tolerable. If you've seen Speed or Speed 2, then you've seen this. Disaffected US army officers turned terrorists steal bomb that explodes at 50C: ice-cream lorry driver and soda jerk foil their evil plot. They have saved on star salaries: Cuba Gooding Jr and Skeet Ulrich are our pretty downmarket heroes. They've saved on the script as well, which is little more than 'Aw! shit!' endlessly repeated. But director Hugh Johnson has enough cash in the bank for some decent special effects and he whips up an undemanding storm of action. Don't strain to catch it now, though: it has Channel 5 written all over it. </p> <p>So to two pleasant surprises. <strong> Isn't She Great</strong> isn't great, but this standard bio of Jacqueline Susann, first queen of the bonkbusters, rattles crisply along, full of fun and delivered with consistent style. Bette Midler is Jackie, the failed actress who wanted to be famous, and Nathan Lane is Irving, the stolidly unassuming agent/ hubbie who set her roaming Valley of the Dolls. </p> <p>Once upon a distant time, I interviewed Susann and she didn't remotely resemble Midler, who appears to have confused her with Ethel Merman. The original doll was brittle and nervy and plastered in pancake make-up, droning portentously away while Irv stayed safely in the Dorchester bedroom. And, indeed, when you turn to the Michael Korda memoir which sparked this enterprise, the lack of similarity is total. The real Jackie said: 'My readers are like Stella Dallas. They want to press their noses against the windows of other people's houses and get a look at the parties they'll never be invited to, the dresses they'll never get to wear, the lives they'll never live, the guys they'll never fuck.' She and Irv weren't a cuddly twosome, more Mr and Mrs Rapter. </p> <p>But who cares? Andrew Bergman may have finished off Demi Moore with Striptease , but he knows how to set Midler free to do her strident, ebullient thing. Stockard Channing makes a pleasantly malicious best mate; John Cleese picks up an easy payday as Susann's grotesque publisher. It bears about as much relationship to reality as Tony Curtis's Houdini or Mario Lanza's Caruso - and you wouldn't guess that Jackie's trade was seamy side up when it came to deflowering virgins. Good news, though: her girls always wanted to get married in the end. They're period pieces - and we can laugh with what passes for an easy conscience. </p> <p>The other pleasant surprise, <strong> Jaya Ganga</strong>, is a curiosity, a first film by the Paris-based Indian novelist Vijay Singh, about a Paris-based Indian novelist (Asil Rais) who goes home in search of an ephemeral lost love called Jaya. It's a road movie - or more precisely, a river movie as Rais journeys the Ganges from mountain to plain - which arrives in Britain after four years by way of Montreal, Mar del Plata, Oslo and 49 weeks in one of France's smaller art houses; survival and dogged progress by word of mouth - and you can see why. Singh is a stilted, neophyte director, advancing in snapshots and set pieces, but he has wonderful scenery to work with - including some of India's more unfamiliar backwaters - and the tale itself is never less than fascinating. Rais meets Zehra (Smriti Mishra), an upmarket prostitute-cum-poetess and buys her freedom from the brothel madame. She gives herself to him in tremulous belief until, out on a boat on the wide river, Jaya returns. Fresh, complex and quite charming. Mishra (one debut among many here) has a shimmering, affecting beauty. If you like it, tell a friend. </p> <p>Gross... grosser... <strong> Big Momma's House</strong>. Martin Lawrence is a Second Division Eddy Murphy, primed with all the derivative Nutty Professor tricks in latex with computer assists. He's an FBI agent on the trail of a bank robber who (for reasons too arid to chronicle) has to dis guise himself as a two-ton Tootsie. The humour is lavatorial end-of-the-pier, tipping constantly into crude farce. Competent players, like Nia Long from love jones - are reduced to cyphers. Few jokes rise above groin level. Yet, to be fair, there's an energy which has clearly battered American audiences into submission. Big Momma is a box-office winner, which (probably) shows that the US is a deeply foreign country of which we comprehend much too little. </p> <p>The infinite variety of British cinema (1): I say, old man... wizard idea. Why not film No\u00ebl Coward's <strong> Relative Values</strong> 46 years late in the Isle of Man, so we get all our tax breaks and stuff? Then we could afford a couple of lesser Hollywood luminaries (say, Jeanne Tripplehorn and the stunningly non-charismatic William Baldwin) to pretend to be the brightest lights of their day. And Stephen Fry to do his sub-Jeeves butler bit. And... and Julie Andrews as the Countess of Marshwood. Bound to be a smash, what? </p> <p>Well no, because this wizened saga of the British class system is too long ago and far away from any modern experience; because Coward's control of plot and characters is hopelessly diffused among the mugging and smirking; and because Eric Styles, on this showing, can't direct actors for toffee. Colin Firth is camply impaled as Peter, fount of sardonic witticisms. Sophie Thompson's Moxie, the upwardly mobile maid, twitters desperately. It's all jolly embarrassing, especially for an increasingly formidable Dame Julie, the only human reference point around. I kept hoping she'd burst into song. </p> <p>The infinite variety of British comedy (2): <strong> Brothers</strong>, a marginally dramatic clone of late-night Sky TV's randy holidays exposed, follows five yobs to Greece and stews them there in a pot of vomit, semen, faeces and ouzo. You come out feeling soiled and thinking that the Daily Mail may be right after all. But ritual disgust is beside the point. Martin Dunkerton (of modest Channel 4 fame) thinks that there's box-office gold at the end of this unwiped orifice. If he's right, we can probably forget Euro 2004 as well.</p>",

And Stephen Fry to do his sub-Jeeves butler bit. And... and Julie Andrews as the Countess of Marshwood. Bound to be a smash, what? Well no, because this wizened saga of the British class system is too long ago and far away from any modern experience; because Coward's control of plot and characters is hopelessly diffused among the mugging and smirking; and because Eric Styles, on this showing, can't direct actors for toffee. Colin Firth is camply impaled as Peter, fount of sardonic witticisms. Sophie Thompson's Moxie, the upwardly mobile maid, twitters desperately. It's all jolly embarrassing, especially for an increasingly formidable Dame Julie, the only human reference point around. I kept hoping she'd burst into song. The infinite variety of British comedy (2): Brothers, a marginally dramatic clone of late-night Sky TV's randy holidays exposed, follows five yobs to Greece and stews them there in a pot of vomit, semen, faeces and ouzo. You come out feeling soiled and thinking that the Daily Mail may be right after all. But ritual disgust is beside the point. Martin Dunkerton (of modest Channel 4 fame) thinks that there's box-office gold at the end of this unwiped orifice. If he's right, we can probably forget Euro 2004 as well.",

Its new building, the Wellcome Wing, is South Kensington's answer to the Tate Modern, an attempt to do something that the Science Museum hasn't done before. Boasting an Imax cinema and a series of highly theatrical installations, it is the closest the museum feels it can safely get to the new generation of science centres that try to seduce the allergic with dollops of sweetening interactive syrup. It's a reflection of the nagging fear that unless we do something drastic, we face raising a generation of technological illiterates clinging to the wreckage of a once-great scientific culture like the devotees of a cargo cult. </p> <p>Designed by Richard MacCormac, the Wellcome Wing is discreet and elegant on the outside, like a Japanese paper lantern.

While building its new wing, the museum has been hard at work on a comprehensive restructuring of its main floor that has resulted in an impressive new display, Making the Modern World . It's a selection of the most historically significant objects in the museum's collections, ranging from Arkwright's spinning machine to the Babbage Difference Engine. The first, it could be said, is the machine that built Manchester; the second, the first proto-computer, eventually led to Silicon Valley. The display is an attempt to show how we got to where we are now, and acts as an integral prologue to the Wellcome Wing. </p> <p>It's an essential part of Cossons's shrewd twin-track strategy to demonstrate that being popular and being serious are not mutually exclusive. The Science Museum is simply drowning in objects. It has been collecting everything from railway engines to rockets for longer and in greater depth than anybody else. It has warehouses all over Britain stuffed with racks and racks of clothes brushes and musical instruments, Gatling guns and model ships, fuse boxes and sewer-pipe samples. It is the nation's attic, and in it somewhere is the Rosetta stone for our contemporary, technologically based culture. What the museum has been looking for is a means of cracking the code. </p> <p>Curated by Andrew Nahum, designed by architects Wilkinson Eyre, with graphics by Farrow Design, Making the Modern World is a brave attempt to explain and in the process make science an essential part of the wider world of culture. The exhibits are given meaning by what they were before they ever got into the museum. It's a past life that gives them a power and resonance far beyond that of the sculpture that so many of them resemble. They aren't just interpreting what happened, they are what happened. They are witnesses to history and actors in it. </p> <p>The V2 rocket, for example, seized by the British Army from the firing range at Cuxhaven in the last days of the Second World War, is an artefact that can be understood on many levels. In engineering terms it is brilliantly original. As an object in its black and white painted quarterings that allowed it to be tracked photographically on the proving ground, it looks as beautiful as a Brancusi. But its manufacture in caves led to the death of 20,000 slave labourers. The 1,000 or so rockets fired in anger at Britain in 1944 and 1945 were terrifyingly destructive, as is the threat that its technological successors, nuclear-tipped ICBMs, still represent. It is only when you take all these meanings together that you really understand what the V2 is. </p> <p>Or take the Leica M2 camera manufactured in 1965 on show in a case not far from the V2. It's an elegant, functional design. But this particular camera belonged to Nick Ut, a war photographer who used it to take the horrifying picture of Kim Phuc, running in flames down a palm-lined country road in 1972 after her Vietnamese village was napalm-bombed. Showing the camera next to the transmitter used by Ut to wire the photo to Associated Press for distribution around the world, as well as the contact sheets from which he made his selection, in no way diminishes the power of the most haunting image of the horror of war since Goya.

Yet after a limping start, <b> Aldeburgh</b> has recovered its usual bright form. On the second weekend, the sun shone and the Hepworth sculptures which stand between the Maltings and the marshes were handed over to the nation in one of those arcane British ceremonies in which great and good, some associated with Aldeburgh since Britten's day, gathered in the early evening haze to chink glasses and celebrate a state of almost no change (the sculptures stay where they are but are now in the care of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge). </p> <p>The events in this, the fifty-third festival, place a rewarding emphasis on music - never a foregone conclusion in any festival - with well-constructed programmes rather than flimsy edifices on which to prop big international stars, of which there are blessed few in sight. The force behind this seriousness is Thomas Ad\u00e8s, the artistic director, who is quietly in evidence as pianist, conductor and composer while not dominating proceedings. The featured composer instead was Gerald Barry. This Irish iconoclast was the focus of an intriguing Composers' Ensemble portrait concert, though the deafening acoustic of the Pear-Britten School Recital Room (in place of the Jubilee Hall) railed against enjoyment. A highlight was 'Water Parted', a poignant microcosm of Barry's opera The Intelligence Park , sung by the mezzo-soprano Buddug Verona James, smoky-voiced and striking. Later, Birmingham Contemporary Music Group conducted by Ad\u00e8s gave the world premiere of Barry's hard-driven, punchy and exuberant Wiener Blut. </p> <p>Only two of Ad\u00e8s's own compositions are being played, including the UK premiere of his 1999 piece America (A Prophecy), performed by the London Philharmonic, the Tallis Chamber Choir and the Britten-Pears Chamber Choir. Ad\u00e8s wrote America as a millennium piece for the New York Philharmonic and has since reworked it, in search of greater clarity. Scored for soprano, chorus and orchestra, it examines the shattering of natural civilisations by conquering colonists. A prophetess (Janice Watson) soars out of the tumult to issue a warning of the rubble, ashes and tears to come (her words taken from a Mayan text). The cogent, caustic textures and syncopations, which build to a thundering climax and subside into an astringent lament, made a fierce impact in the live Radio 3 broadcast. </p> <p>The Borodin Quartet, now newly established with a different leader and viola player, will give seven concerts at Aldeburgh to launch a two-year project to perform the complete quartet cycles of Beethoven and Shostakovich throughout Europe. In Saturday morning's recital, they were more convincing in the two Shostakovich works, the Quartet No 7 in F sharp minor and the Second Piano Trio (in which they were joined by the formidable Russian pianist Ludmila Berlinskaia). Whereas Beethoven's Op 18 No 6 had sounded urbane and noncommittal, this playing style suited the desiccated melancholy of Shostakovich's 1960 quartet, a spiky, spidery exploration of grief and the shortest of his 15 in the form. </p> <p>At the Wigmore Hall, <b> Andrew Ball</b>, a pianist who deserves medals for his unstinting pursuit of the new, allowed himself the treat of travelling backwards for his fiftieth-birthday recital. Works by Busoni, Schumann and the Russian romantic, Liapunov, revealed an expansive, showy side to Ball usually kept hidden. Nevertheless, by opening with Busoni's innovative 'Sonatina seconda', he tacitly reminded us where his musical loyalties lie. This mysterious work was written in 1912 when Busoni was steeped in the occult and newly startled by the Italian Futurists. While other composers were teetering on the safe harmonic shore, Busoni cast off to the uncharted waters of structural anarchy (the publisher's engraver was so alarmed by the composer's manuscript that he sought reassurance before going ahead with the plates). </p> <p>The modest eight-minute work, without system or key signature and often without barlines, is a first signpost featuring a question mark to announce music's most hazardous path for the next eight decades.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Not One Less</strong> (U, 106 mins) Directed by Zhang Yimou; starring Wei Minzhi, Huike Zhang </p> <p>The wonder of cinema is that, just occasionally, it can take you somewhere you could never go to and sit you down as equals - concerned, involved observers - among people you could never otherwise meet. Say a primary school class deep in rural China, where poverty is making a box of chalk last a month. </p> <p>There's one stooped schoolmaster called Gao and he needs a month off with his dying mum. Can the 'mayor' - grand title for a gap-toothed farmer who never pays his bills - find a supply teacher to fill in? Only a 13-year-old from a neighbouring village. But she doesn't stand a chance of getting paid unless she keeps the dwindling class intact. Lose one more and she has nothing. That's the 'not one less' of the title. </p> <p>Zhang Yimou, from Red Sorghum and Raise the Red Lantern , is a great director. When he lived and worked with the amazing Gong-Li, their films found a world audience and an emotional power that rattled China's rulers in their office cages. But he and Gong-Li have parted now, the end of a prolifically creative affair, and Zhang has changed course utterly. Not One Less has an almost documentary simplicity. No professional actors and the children all use their real names, the mayor is a real mayor, Teacher Gao chalks real blackboards for a living. The decrepit shack of a school in the flyblown scatter of a village is rural depopulation waiting to happen. Zhang doesn't need art to make you believe: immediate authenticity. </p> <p>Wei Minzhi, the 13-year-old in the firing line, is a thin, gawky girl with a stubborn face. At first she sits outside, stunned, as her rabble class run wild, but gradually she gets the hang of things, until the cheeky chappie of indiscipline, 10-year-old Zhang Huike, is suddenly dispatched to the city to scrape a living and send what cash he can back to his sickly mum. Not one less? Teacher Wei has somehow to bring him back. The second half of the film is the odyssey of her search for him among the neon lights and bewildering harshness of urban civilisation. </p> <p>This is not, it should be said clearly, a movie with any global ambitions. Its core audience must be basically inside China. It grows didactic towards the close and the sunny ending, featuring Beijing's answer to Esther Rantzen, seems perfunctorily contrived. But that's not really the point. A film that tells China (and us) that a million children a year have to drop out of school every year in desperate impoverishment and shows us what that means has a fine cinematic heritage, from Bicycle Thieves to Los Olvidados. Better still, if you can identify with the people involved, you can feel for them, too. </p> <p>There's nothing far away about Wei Minzhi's dogged determination or about her class's giggling boredom.

      "bodyText": "Not One Less (U, 106 mins) Directed by Zhang Yimou; starring Wei Minzhi, Huike Zhang The wonder of cinema is that, just occasionally, it can take you somewhere you could never go to and sit you down as equals - concerned, involved observers - among people you could never otherwise meet. Say a primary school class deep in rural China, where poverty is making a box of chalk last a month. There's one stooped schoolmaster called Gao and he needs a month off with his dying mum. Can the 'mayor' - grand title for a gap-toothed farmer who never pays his bills - find a supply teacher to fill in? Only a 13-year-old from a neighbouring village. But she doesn't stand a chance of getting paid unless she keeps the dwindling class intact. Lose one more and she has nothing. That's the 'not one less' of the title. Zhang Yimou, from Red Sorghum and Raise the Red Lantern , is a great director. When he lived and worked with the amazing Gong-Li, their films found a world audience and an emotional power that rattled China's rulers in their office cages. But he and Gong-Li have parted now, the end of a prolifically creative affair, and Zhang has changed course utterly. Not One Less has an almost documentary simplicity. No professional actors and the children all use their real names, the mayor is a real mayor, Teacher Gao chalks real blackboards for a living. The decrepit shack of a school in the flyblown scatter of a village is rural depopulation waiting to happen. Zhang doesn't need art to make you believe: immediate authenticity. Wei Minzhi, the 13-year-old in the firing line, is a thin, gawky girl with a stubborn face. At first she sits outside, stunned, as her rabble class run wild, but gradually she gets the hang of things, until the cheeky chappie of indiscipline, 10-year-old Zhang Huike, is suddenly dispatched to the city to scrape a living and send what cash he can back to his sickly mum. Not one less? Teacher Wei has somehow to bring him back. The second half of the film is the odyssey of her search for him among the neon lights and bewildering harshness of urban civilisation. This is not, it should be said clearly, a movie with any global ambitions. Its core audience must be basically inside China. It grows didactic towards the close and the sunny ending, featuring Beijing's answer to Esther Rantzen, seems perfunctorily contrived. But that's not really the point. A film that tells China (and us) that a million children a year have to drop out of school every year in desperate impoverishment and shows us what that means has a fine cinematic heritage, from Bicycle Thieves to Los Olvidados. Better still, if you can identify with the people involved, you can feel for them, too. There's nothing far away about Wei Minzhi's dogged determination or about her class's giggling boredom. One blackboard jungle is much like another, from Yanqing County to Yeovil. Nor is the awful lure of the city, the draining of resource and hope from the countryside, a phenomenon that ends at the Great Wall. The aim may not be universal and the rattling of bureaucratic cages may be more modestly cautious than heretofore: but its targets arise naturally wherever you are. Zhang Yimou has not gone quiet without his muse. He has merely tried another path, and if you come to remember the moment in triumph when Wei Minzhi's sullen face splits into a smile, you'll remember the final eagerness to learn and the strength of leadership discovered along that human trek. \u0095 Philip French is on holiday",

      "body": "<p><strong> Radiohead</strong> Piazza Santa Croce, Florence </p> <p>It's the longest day of the year, and three years exactly since the last time I saw Radiohead. Then, it was Dublin in a thunderstorm; tonight it is Florence in a warm, cloudless dusk. Then, the band was celebrating the ecstatic reaction to its third album, OK Computer ; now it is testing out tracks from the long-awaited fourth album (as yet untitled, due in October). In 1997, the mood was of complicated euphoria (nothing's ever simple with Radiohead); in 2000, it is nervous expectancy. </p> <p>The creation of the new album has been a tortuous process. Read through guitarist Ed O'Brien's internet diary for the last 18 months, and you get the impression of a band uncomfortably questioning everything they do, a band seemingly terrified of the 'slick' or the 'obvious'. Songs have been reworked, remixed and scrapped relentlessly, in a desperate attempt not to release anything too catchy. The good news is: they've succeeded. On the evidence of the 10 new songs previewed here, the new album is not contaminated by even the tiniest hint of catchiness. </p> <p>Not that the crowd seem too concerned by the prospect. Mostly tanned and beautiful, singing football chants, smoking, flirting and laughing, they don't look like stereotypical Radiohead fans at all. Up on the roof terraces overlooking this glorious piazza, people clink glasses and wait happily for the band's arrival. Their loping English frames are greeted with huge cheers. </p> <p>The first thing you notice about Radiohead 2000 is that Thom Yorke seems to have been working out. He has the same severely cropped blond hair, the same pallid skin, but his biceps bulge and he looks less wraithlike. Fitter, happier...</p> <p>The first song is even called 'Optimistic'. With its sinuous acoustic shuffle, it even sounds optimistic, at least until the dark string samples and the screaming start. They then play two songs from The Bends ('Bones' and 'Planet Telex'), and, as the sky darkens and a cloud of hashish hovers over us like smog, a magisterial rendition of 'Karma Police'. All this combines to create a false sense of security among the fans. </p> <p>Then 'Morning Bell', the second of the new songs, is played. Yorke picks out some jazzy chords on electric piano, a syncopated drumbeat kicks in, Jonny Greenwood makes his guitar sound like an accordion. The vibe is strangely mellow. Gradually, tempo and intensity are turned up, and Yorke glides from high-pitched moaning to a sort of muttered rap. It ends. The sound of 3,000 people saying 'Hmmm...' fills the air. </p> <p>They follow it with another new song. 'How to Disappear Completely...' is oceanic and eerie, all strummed acoustic, drifting bass and string samples. 'I'm not here...' Yorke sings, then starts to wail wordlessly. 'Hmmm...' says the crowd, again. After a rabidly received version of 'Street Spirit' and an upbeat old B-side called 'Talk Show Host', they play two more new songs. They are stylistically very different - 'Everyone, The National Anthem' is a Chemical Brothers-style blast of fuzz bass and pounding breakbeat, with Yorke screaming something about 'The fear!', while 'Kid A' is a neo-funk workout with clavinet, wah-wah guitar and prowling bass. </p> <p>However, a definite pattern has begun to emerge by now: these songs are not, strictly speaking, songs at all. They are jams, montages, sonic experiments, unrelieved by vocal melodies or hooklines. Yorke's voice seems to have become another instrument rather than the focus of the music - which is interesting , of course, but something of a disappointment to the Italian crowd, who demonstrate the kind of Radiohead song they prefer by waving their lighters to 'Lucky' and moshing excitedly to 'Just'. </p> <p>Of the five other new tracks aired by the band, the weirdest is 'You and Whose Army', which begins with Yorke crooning tunelessly through a distorting microphone while playing chords on the piano seemingly at random. Someone in the audience laughs, and the singer gets cross: 'Shut up!' he shouts, unsmiling, before the track swells into a sort of gospel-inflected rock opera. The most radio-friendly track is probably 'Knives Out', which starts off sounding like an upbeat Smiths single, all jangly guitar and nice chord patterns, but studiously refuses to develop a chorus of any kind. The best of the new tracks, though, is 'Egyptian Song', which, with its slow, intoxicating piano rhythm and Yorke's haunting falsetto, sounds like an elegy for Jeff Buckley. </p> <p>So where does this leave us? My initial reaction to Radiohead's new direction was, I admit, puzzlement and frustration. Why would a band with such a rare gift for combining sonic invention with memorable, emotive songs, give up half of its winning formula? For all of OK Computer 's futuristic production, you could still play most of its songs on acoustic guitar in a subway station if you were so minded. That is clearly not the case with the new songs. </p> <p>Having said that, there are four songs on OK Computer - 'Airbag', 'Subterranean Homesick Alien', 'Exit Music', 'Climbing Up the Walls' - that, in retrospect, pointed the way towards Radiohead 2000. Linear, atmospheric and inspired by the high-pressure rhythms of Miles Davis's Bitches Brew , they now sound like prototypes for the new songs. </p> <p>In fact, looking back over Radiohead's evolutionary progress over four albums reminds me of two other bands who started off by adding a slight twist to pop/rock conventions - Talking Heads and Talk Talk - and went on to make fourth albums which pushed the envelope of popular music: Remain in Light and Spirit of Eden . My guess is that the fourth Radiohead album will have a similarly ground-breaking feel. </p> <p>Still, if atmospheric prog-jazz-rock is not really your thing, don't despair. Radiohead have not lost their mantle as one of the world's most powerful live bands. The concert in Florence ended triumphantly, after two hours, with a stormy ride through 'Paranoid Android', the 'Bohemian Rhapsody' of its generation, and a magnificent 'Exit Music'. 'The panic, the vomit!/ The panic, the vomit!' the crowd roared in Latin-accented unison. 'We hope that you choke,' Yorke sang sweetly back to them. Many people undoubtedly will when they hear the new album. </p> <p>\u0095 Radiohead play the Meltdown festival, Royal Festival Hall, on 1 July.

Why else would they act as though London was now art capital of the world when 'much of the work you see was shown in New York first'? </p> <p>This rebuke from the cultural imperium sounded strangely antique, as if written in the days before art became a global business. Kimmelman even went on to remind his readers how long it took the British to appreciate Abstract Expressionism back in the Fifties. But his article perfectly encapsulated the transatlantic delay that still besets the special relationship: each country fondly believing that the other lags far behind it. Take the new Gagosian Gallery, which opened last month in London's West End. Larry Gagosian is the most successful art dealer in the US, with galleries in Los Angeles and Manhattan. Kimmelman regards his advance into London as a form of colonisation and a sign of change. Here, the Gallery is seen as retrograde, a belated attempt to capitalise on the London art boom of the Nineties.

In 'Sleepwalker', a sullen adolescent masturbates into the children's paddling pool. In 'Bad Boy', his cousin sneaks a glimpse of a woman's naked pudenda while groping for money in her open bag. She might be his mother, his sister, his neighbour - this was John Updike with an incestuous twist.

The oil paintings form a freeze-frame sequence, enacted in a single bedroom and featuring the same nude woman. Scene 1: a naked man stares intently at you, though his appetite is clearly pricked for the stripping woman whose silhouette appears on the wall. Scene 2: she becomes your private dancer, nose as pert as Barbie and nipples to match, while another man lies detumescent on the bed. Scene 3: a clothed man fingers his collar apprehensively, while the woman slumps on the floor; and so on until the final image which zeroes exclusively on her pudenda. </p> <p>There are continuity faults - nightstands vanish, telephones appear - to establish a specious air of uncertainty. Some sort of narrative is trailed in the shifting male cast, which apparently includes a likeness of the film director Mike Nichols. At one point, the woman even seemed to be replaced by a mysterious sister, though this turned out to be no more than defective brushwork. Everything strains for portentous effect: an effect scuppered by Fischl's lack of skill as an artist. </p> <p>These pictures are full of holes - where Fischl can't bring off an arm or a leg, or can't resolve some cinematic pull of focus. He likes the idea of momentary transition, but tries to achieve it by slithering incoherently all over the canvas. He uses paint like greasy lubricant. For a figure painter, his anatomy is amazingly inept. Worse, by his own humble admission, Fischl has never mastered even the rudiments of draughtsmanship. </p> <p>Which doesn't leave much but content and a starry reputation in the US.

Kilimnik loves ballet: there are amateur snapshots of The Nut cracker and a model of Giselle's grave, complete with balsawood headstone and a garland of plastic lilies. She loves film stars: there are lots of wispy pin-ups, awkwardly painted from magazine photographs. She adores ponies, flowers, fashion and fairylights and, believing that she might have some Russian blood, she has included an effortful sketch of Nureyev and an imaginary map of Russia in pretty gold paint. </p> <p>Kilimnik is 45 and an inveterate fantasist. In New York, she was pegged as a pioneer of 'scatter' art, though that seems a heavy burden for such narrow shoulders. If there was any vision in her media-based images you might call them na\u00efve; more talent and you'd call them kitsch. As it is, her arrested development seems painfully real; her art forever trapped in the pre-teen bedroom.</p>",

Kilimnik loves ballet: there are amateur snapshots of The Nut cracker and a model of Giselle's grave, complete with balsawood headstone and a garland of plastic lilies. She loves film stars: there are lots of wispy pin-ups, awkwardly painted from magazine photographs. She adores ponies, flowers, fashion and fairylights and, believing that she might have some Russian blood, she has included an effortful sketch of Nureyev and an imaginary map of Russia in pretty gold paint. Kilimnik is 45 and an inveterate fantasist. In New York, she was pegged as a pioneer of 'scatter' art, though that seems a heavy burden for such narrow shoulders. If there was any vision in her media-based images you might call them na\u00efve; more talent and you'd call them kitsch. As it is, her arrested development seems painfully real; her art forever trapped in the pre-teen bedroom.",

      "body": "<p>If you listen to The Archers, and millions do, you will be crossing three sets of fingers this week. One for the Grundys (has poor old Joe lost the plot?), two for Mike Tucker's strawberries, and three for Ruth Archer, devoted wife and mother of two young children, who has just been diagnosed with Breast Cancer and is now fearfully awaiting a mastectomy. 'Seventy percent of women who undergo the operation continue to lead a normal life,' a sympathetic woman doctor advised Ruth and her husband, David, in a poignant episode last week. 'That's reassuring, isn't it, Ruth,' said David. 'I just want to go home, please David, take me home,' said Ruth. </p> <p>When The Archers first came on air, 50 years ago, its brief was to educate the postwar public about new farming methods, which it continues to do: Pat's stumpy carrots dealt recently with the organic issue, young Tommy got clobbered for damaging GM crops and if John Archer's premature demise (his tractor tipped over and crushed him) hasn't yet produced an EU Health &amp; Safety ruling regarding the correct use of agricultural machinery, you can be sure it's in the pipeline. </p> <p>The farming brief has broadened over the years to include general social issues and The Archers ' scriptwriters have never been afraid of tackling difficult, complex subjects. There was Elizabeth's abortion and Susan Carter's three-month prison sentence, and as soon as Ruth comes round from the anaesthetic - always assuming of course that she does come round - she'll be straight back into the Great Brookfield Inheritance struggle. </p> <p>The breast cancer story line, however, is a particularly strong one, because, of all the serious health problems that women can face in their lives - infertility, menopause, hysterectomy - mastectomy, with its overtones of disfigurement and mutilation, is the most taboo. </p> <p>How helpful is it to women actually suffering from breast cancer, especially young women (Ruth Archer is 34), to have such a delicate personal problem aired in such a public way? When Ruth was first diagnosed, Radio 4 invited listeners to ring a special confidential helpline for further advice, but says it's too early to gauge the response. However, Friday's Feedback reported a pretty negative response to the way the subject had been tackled. Listeners felt it should have been treated more opti mistically. Conversely, when Peggy, the barmaid played by Barbara Windsor in EastEnders , had a mastectomy last year, hundreds of viewers, men and women, wrote to the BBC, thanking the producer for tackling a difficult subject so sensitively. 'It's the first time, as far as we know, that anyone in a soap has had a mastectomy,' said Sharon from the EastEnders production office. </p> <p>Not everyone was impressed, however. Felicity Smart, who had a mastectomy five years ago and a further operation on her left breast last Christmas, wrote to the BBC shortly after Peggy's ordeal on behalf of the Breast Carer Support Group at St Thomas's Hospital in London. Emotionally it hit the spot, they agreed, but medically it was hopelessly inaccurate. No one pulls pints and wisecracks with customers three days after having a mastectomy. </p> <p>When Felicity Finch, who plays Ruth in The Archers, learned about her gruelling new story line, she contacted Breakthrough, the national charity committed to fighting breast cancer through research and awareness for more information. 'Breakthrough sent me a lot of very helpful leaflets,' says Felicity. 'So that at least when I got round to talking to people who had had breast cancer I knew something about it. As an actor you always have to research your part but somehow this was different. It snowballed. Everyone I talked to seemed to have a relative or a friend who'd been through it. That was the other thing - everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think your character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation. </p> <p>'What did surprise me, though, when I was doing my research, was just how many young women there are who get breast cancer straight after pregnancy these days. But when they go to see their GPs about lumps in their breast they are told there's nothing wrong - it's just something connected with their pregnancy. I do believe that by tackling a story line like this, The Archers is doing a great service for women's health.' </p> <p>Miranda Vicenti was 23 when she was told she had breast cancer. That was nine years ago. At the time she had two children - Daniella, 20 months, and Serge, three months. Two years after her first mastectomy, she went back to hospital for a second. 'Anything that raises public awareness of the problem and makes other people sympathetic to women who have it must surely be a good thing,' says Miranda who recently gave up her job as an air hostess. She underwent seven months of extremely painful reconstruction surgery, which involved removing some of her back muscles and countless skin grafts. Miranda's Chest, a Channel 4 documentary chronicling the entire operation, was broadcast in October 1998. 'People said I was mad or an exhibitionist or both to publicise it so blatantly but I was thinking about the whole awareness thing.

      "bodyText": "If you listen to The Archers, and millions do, you will be crossing three sets of fingers this week. One for the Grundys (has poor old Joe lost the plot?), two for Mike Tucker's strawberries, and three for Ruth Archer, devoted wife and mother of two young children, who has just been diagnosed with Breast Cancer and is now fearfully awaiting a mastectomy. 'Seventy percent of women who undergo the operation continue to lead a normal life,' a sympathetic woman doctor advised Ruth and her husband, David, in a poignant episode last week. 'That's reassuring, isn't it, Ruth,' said David. 'I just want to go home, please David, take me home,' said Ruth. When The Archers first came on air, 50 years ago, its brief was to educate the postwar public about new farming methods, which it continues to do: Pat's stumpy carrots dealt recently with the organic issue, young Tommy got clobbered for damaging GM crops and if John Archer's premature demise (his tractor tipped over and crushed him) hasn't yet produced an EU Health &amp; Safety ruling regarding the correct use of agricultural machinery, you can be sure it's in the pipeline. The farming brief has broadened over the years to include general social issues and The Archers ' scriptwriters have never been afraid of tackling difficult, complex subjects. There was Elizabeth's abortion and Susan Carter's three-month prison sentence, and as soon as Ruth comes round from the anaesthetic - always assuming of course that she does come round - she'll be straight back into the Great Brookfield Inheritance struggle. The breast cancer story line, however, is a particularly strong one, because, of all the serious health problems that women can face in their lives - infertility, menopause, hysterectomy - mastectomy, with its overtones of disfigurement and mutilation, is the most taboo. How helpful is it to women actually suffering from breast cancer, especially young women (Ruth Archer is 34), to have such a delicate personal problem aired in such a public way? When Ruth was first diagnosed, Radio 4 invited listeners to ring a special confidential helpline for further advice, but says it's too early to gauge the response.

      "body": "<p>I am ashamed to admit I have been indoctrinated by a bank. Not in a big way, I hasten to add, but it has been costing me around \u00a350 a year in bank charges, even though I've never had an overdraft. </p> <p>When I went freelance, my bank training (coupled with a vague desire to impress my tax office) led me to believe that as a self-employed person I would need to open a separate business account. So I did. But was it really necessary? </p> <p>No, said the Inland Revenue. Although it is 'helpful to maintain a separate bank account' it doesn't matter what kind it is so long as you meet the legal requirement to keep adequate records of all business transactions. </p> <p>Yes, said the banks. All those questioned took a dim view of people who use the free services of a personal current account for business purposes. 'The reason why banks differentiate between personal and business accounts is that business customers create more work, so their accounts cost more to run,' says Brian Capon of the British Bankers' Association (BBA). </p> <p>Surely my modest and cashless enterprise's yearly total of 18 cheques in and two out isn't that expensive to deal with - especially as I save the bank money by using its phone banking service to pay my expenses? </p> <p>'These days there is a wavy line between personal and business accounts,' says Capon. 'Transaction level is the key factor. If you're only paying in a couple of cheques per month and you don't expect your bank to handle large amounts of cash, it may be willing to run a business account free of charge if you negotiate.' </p> <p>So I'd better add 'talk way out of bank charges' to my 'to do' list. Alternatively, I could make a note to change my account altogether. </p> <p>The Business Investor account from Nationwide looks interesting. You can pay in up to 10 cheques a day and make a maximum of six withdrawals a month without charge, and the account pays interest of 2.05 per cent on balances over \u00a32,000. But although the account comes with a cheque book, it lacks the convenience of telephone banking. </p> <p>It could make sense to take up the offer of at least a year's free banking from Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds TSB, as I did when I opened my NatWest account (a year's free banking is still available for new customers). But once the free-banking period is over, these banks' charges, as well as those of Girobank, would be little different from what I am paying NatWest. With an average cost of 60p to write or pay in a cheque and around 40p for automated transactions, you can see why the Treasury's Banking Review team, headed by Don Cruickshank, thinks the average bank customer pays \u00a3400 a year in bank charges. </p> <p>Most personal customers may pay nothing, but a small business which makes 15 deposits a week could easily pay that much - and that's before taking account of the monthly service charge. </p> <p>It would be harder to hit the \u00a3400 mark with an account from the Co-operative Bank, but only if you maintain a balance of at least \u00a32,000; otherwise it would cost slightly more than most of the other high-street offerings. Keeping a balance of at least \u00a35,000 on the Bank of Scotland's Direct Business Cheque Account secures zero charges and a reasonably healthy 3.75 per cent in credit interest (a lower rate is paid on balances below \u00a35,000). But, in common with Royal Bank of Scotland's charge-free Business Banking Direct Account, you have to be happy to pay in your hard-earned cheques by post. Unless you pay extra to use a secure postal service - such as Royal Mail Special Delivery or Post Cash - you'll have the hassle of going back to whoever paid you to get a replacement if a cheque goes missing in the post. </p> <p>The advantage of being able to pay in a cheque over the counter is that if it gets lost in the banking system, it's the bank's responsibility. This is also true of a cheque paid in via a cash machine, which is the alternative to postal depositing offered by Abbey National's Business Bank Account. Aimed at business customers who keep their accounts in credit, it carries no charges if you pay in fewer than 25 cheques a month and/or make fewer than 25 withdrawals (the limits are 50 in the first year). And unlike the other banks, Abbey National offers both telephone and Internet banking. </p> <p>\u0095 Abbey National 0845 300 3040, Bank of Scotland 0500 828 111, Co-op 0345 215 215, Girobank 0800 214 807 Royal Bank of Scotland 0800 521 607.

Yes, said the banks. All those questioned took a dim view of people who use the free services of a personal current account for business purposes. 'The reason why banks differentiate between personal and business accounts is that business customers create more work, so their accounts cost more to run,' says Brian Capon of the British Bankers' Association (BBA). Surely my modest and cashless enterprise's yearly total of 18 cheques in and two out isn't that expensive to deal with - especially as I save the bank money by using its phone banking service to pay my expenses? 'These days there is a wavy line between personal and business accounts,' says Capon. 'Transaction level is the key factor. If you're only paying in a couple of cheques per month and you don't expect your bank to handle large amounts of cash, it may be willing to run a business account free of charge if you negotiate.' So I'd better add 'talk way out of bank charges' to my 'to do' list. Alternatively, I could make a note to change my account altogether. The Business Investor account from Nationwide looks interesting. You can pay in up to 10 cheques a day and make a maximum of six withdrawals a month without charge, and the account pays interest of 2.05 per cent on balances over \u00a32,000. But although the account comes with a cheque book, it lacks the convenience of telephone banking. It could make sense to take up the offer of at least a year's free banking from Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds TSB, as I did when I opened my NatWest account (a year's free banking is still available for new customers). But once the free-banking period is over, these banks' charges, as well as those of Girobank, would be little different from what I am paying NatWest. With an average cost of 60p to write or pay in a cheque and around 40p for automated transactions, you can see why the Treasury's Banking Review team, headed by Don Cruickshank, thinks the average bank customer pays \u00a3400 a year in bank charges. Most personal customers may pay nothing, but a small business which makes 15 deposits a week could easily pay that much - and that's before taking account of the monthly service charge. It would be harder to hit the \u00a3400 mark with an account from the Co-operative Bank, but only if you maintain a balance of at least \u00a32,000; otherwise it would cost slightly more than most of the other high-street offerings. Keeping a balance of at least \u00a35,000 on the Bank of Scotland's Direct Business Cheque Account secures zero charges and a reasonably healthy 3.75 per cent in credit interest (a lower rate is paid on balances below \u00a35,000). But, in common with Royal Bank of Scotland's charge-free Business Banking Direct Account, you have to be happy to pay in your hard-earned cheques by post. Unless you pay extra to use a secure postal service - such as Royal Mail Special Delivery or Post Cash - you'll have the hassle of going back to whoever paid you to get a replacement if a cheque goes missing in the post. The advantage of being able to pay in a cheque over the counter is that if it gets lost in the banking system, it's the bank's responsibility. This is also true of a cheque paid in via a cash machine, which is the alternative to postal depositing offered by Abbey National's Business Bank Account. Aimed at business customers who keep their accounts in credit, it carries no charges if you pay in fewer than 25 cheques a month and/or make fewer than 25 withdrawals (the limits are 50 in the first year). And unlike the other banks, Abbey National offers both telephone and Internet banking. \u0095 Abbey National 0845 300 3040, Bank of Scotland 0500 828 111, Co-op 0345 215 215, Girobank 0800 214 807 Royal Bank of Scotland 0800 521 607.

'Whereas the 1993 guidelines suggested that credit grantors should give reasons when turning down an applicant for credit, the new guide says that they will give one or a number of reasons,' he says. </p> <p>According to David Smith of the Finance and Leasing Association, the guide places specific responsibilities on those in the credit industry to be more open in explaining adverse decisions. He says that not only will customers be told they have been refused credit because they have not reached the credit score target, or because of something adverse on their credit reference agency file, but, where it is relevant, they will also be given a specific reason for their rejection. For example, he says: 'Where a customer is refused credit because a large mortgage means they are already fully financially committed, they will be told that that is the reason.' </p> <p>However, Sharp admits that although greater transparency is generally a good thing, it can also have its dangers. He says the move to greater openness risks more fraud. And for that reason 'the industry shouldn't and mustn't go into tremendous depth when explaining decisions'. Although the guidelines are not law, he says the commitments made by the industry in dealing with applicants refused credit 'come as close to a right as you can get'. </p> <p>But Jane Guy of the Money Advice Association is dubious about the need for greater openness. 'Some decisions will be bad decisions,' she says, 'but the majority are fair and reasonable.' For example: 'Changes in circumstances, such as separation, divorce and bereavement, are often probably sound reasons for declining loans.' </p> <p>She suggests people consider seeking advice before applying for credit. 'They can then see why it is likely they would be rejected.' For example, an 18-year-old who asks for a loan of \u00a3500 is likely to be accepted, but anyone over 25 who has never had credit before is likely to be refused. </p> <p>Guy says: 'Because they are not often challenged, it is rare for credit grantors to overturn decisions.' But occasionally this happens. Guy recalls the case of a single mother with two children who was in full-time work. She had been refused a personal loan because the lender felt that, as someone without childcare support, she would not be a reliable worker. 'The Money Advice Association took evidence of her work and sickness record to the lender, and they overturned the decision,' she says. </p> <p>Carol Hufton, senior compliance manager at the Office of the Data Protection Registrar, says she has never known a case of a person being given a detailed explanation of why their application was turned down. </p> <p>'Decisions are often made on an amalgamation of factors,' she says. And although she admits that not having the right to detailed reasons can be a source of great frustration for people, and though she often sympathises with the predicaments of individuals, she says she can usually understand why the decision was made. 'Without trying to defend decisions made by credit grantors, credit isn't a right, and there is no legal right to know why you have been refused.' </p> <p>Lloyds TSB says that although the bank has signed up to the new guidelines, and committed to its policies, it is wary of providing customers with too much detailed information: 'There is a fine line between providing more information on decisions and playing into the hands of fraudsters.' </p> <p>The bank produces its own guide to credit scoring, and encourages customers who are experiencing difficulties to come in to talk. The spokesperson says that where credit is refused because of something adverse on a credit rating agency, the bank will advise the customer on how to obtain that information. And where someone has failed to meet the target credit score, 'although they won't be given detailed reasons, they may be given hints - such as the fact that they have had 10 cheques returned unpaid in recent months'. </p> <p>The spokesperson adds that Lloyds TSB will also inform customers if a person is turned down because of the bank's lending policies. For example, if it were the bank's policy not to lend to people over the age of 70, or not to offer a personal loan of less than \u00a3500, individuals not meeting these criteria would be told. But whether such sentiments really represent the prospect of greater openness for those refused credit is still unclear. 'We will just have to see how it goes,' says Sharp.</p>",

Management will set out plans to promote the benefits policyholders have received by investing with the mutual. However, the insurer - which has a reputation for arrogance and aloofness in the financial services industry - is resisting special bonuses for policyholders on the basis that this would be interpreted as a bribe.

And, at 3 o'clock in the morning, they could be answering your 999 call. </p> <p>'The building was unfit. The heating and ventilation were poor and it was infested with fleas.' This is Dougie Rafferty, who worked as a 999 operator and spoke out about conditions in his Glasgow call centre. Six months later there is still no code of practice for emergency calls and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is investigating call centres generally. </p> <p>These are defined by the HSE as work environments in which the main business is conducted over the phone by a handler also using display screen equipment. They usually operate on a contract basis, handling calls for clients across several industries. Rafferty, for example, worked for Excell Multimedia, handling emergency calls on behalf of Cable and Wireless Communications (CWC). </p> <p>Telebusiness is growing at 40 per cent a year - 40 per cent more piped music and 'putting you on hold'. Occasionally, it can be more than merely irritating. Oftel, which regulates telephone services, was forced to investigate CWC's 999 call handling procedures after emergency services were provided with incorrect addresses (see box below). </p> <p>Oftel still has no formal code of practice with carriers handling emergency calls. Even if a code is introduced, it will not cover competence or training. 'We can't influence a company's relationship with employees,' Oftel's spokes person admitted. 'We monitor quality, not terms of employment.' </p> <p>But concern is increasingly focused on terms of employment. The Government reckons that by 2002 there will be more people working in call centres in the UK than there will be teachers and farmers put together. </p> <p>When Rafferty went public this year, things were not looking good. 'There was no sick pay, so you'd get people coming in with streaming colds and passing them on. One guy had an epileptic fit and had his pay docked for time spent in the ambulance and hospital. Staff turnover was at least 125 per cent.' </p> <p>Call centres have even created their own industrial injury. Solicitor Adrian Fawden, who acts for the Communications Workers Union, has dealt with dozens of cases of acoustic shock. 'A sudden loud noise down the headset can cause long-term tinnitus - ringing in the ear - and over-sensitivity to noise,' he says. 'It's the shock as much as the volume.' </p> <p>Despite this, a joint TUC/Royal National Institute for Deaf People survey found that nine out of 10 call centre staff had had no training in the risks of noise. Fawden warns: 'Technology is running ahead of safety with software constantly being upgraded to handle more calls.' </p> <p>The HSE began its examination following the RNID/TUC report and hopes to publish its preliminary findings this summer, but it admits this is a new area. 'Many call centres get away with being pretty awful places to be because of the local labour market,' says the Communications Workers Union regional organiser Donald McDonald. 'Usually they're sited in areas of high unemployment. That's why you get university graduates prepared to work for \u00a39,500 a year.' </p> <p>However, there is evidence that things are changing. Rafferty's former employer, Excell Multimedia, has lost its \u00a3140 million contract to Vertex. 'Typically the worst team or individual was identified and named and shamed in public,' says McDonald. 'It was common practice in the industry, but Vertex has stopped it and staff report a much better atmosphere.' </p> <p>The new employer, which has 12 centres and 5,000 staff who answer 100 million calls a year, also offered a 4.8 per cent pay rise. 'When we arrived we asked staff what they wanted and they gave us 257 suggestions which we're now looking at with employee rep resentatives,' says Vertex's Janie Hazelwood. 'Our style is not about command and control; it's about our clients' reputations.' </p> <p>But with sick pay still not provided and no increase in the 15 days' holiday a year, Rafferty, who now works for the Communications Workers Union, is reserving judgment. 'I want to see significant changes in these places.' </p> <p>So, apparently, does the Call Centre Association (CCA), which represents 430 companies operating 4,500 centres. This month, it is piloting service standards in 24 centres which it hopes will be up and running throughout the industry by next year. 'They'll be about customer service and staff, rather like the Investors In People initiative,' says the CCA's head of quality and standards, Colin Mackay. </p> <p>Stuart MacMillan Pratt is managing director of The Ops Room, which provides marketing services to companies including Aiwa, Land Rover and Mars. Its 60-station call centre is staffed by a mixture of permanent and temporary staff. 'People are realising that large call factories are impersonal and that smaller units are better,' he says. 'I know all my staff personally. I trust them to organise their breaks within their team. I trust them to handle a call and to know how long it needs to last.' MacMillan Pratt argues that the proof of the pudding is that 80 per cent of his permanent staff started as temps. </p> <p>Customer contact should be based on training, not on scripts, he says. 'We offer training in basic skills and also in the specific products. Our staff don't just know about Land Rovers, they've actually been off-road driving one.' </p> <p>At the end of this year the CCA will change its name to the Call and Contact Centre Association to reflect the growth of e-commerce. Mackay believes this development is good for call centre staff. 'Call centres won't be killed off by the growth of the internet,' he says, 'but they will change. They'll have to become involved in a wider range of activities, which will increase opportunities for staff and should make the work more interesting.' </p> <p>Just how much more interesting is open to debate. Vertex's Hazelwood admits: 'At the end of the day, the job is answering telephones.' </p> <p><strong>Emergency service or service emergency?</strong></p> <p>Deregulation of telecoms has made the chain of responsibility for 999 calls more complex. Three companies - BT, Cable and Wireless Communications, and Kingston Communications - handle them in call centres. </p> <p>It is Oftel's responsibility to ensure that 999 calls are correctly routed and take priority over others. After that, they are the Home Office's responsibility. </p> <p>Dougie Rafferty, a former 999 operator for CWC, says that as 999 calls aren't profit-making they are not top priority. 'No extra staff were put on for events like Firework Night, and record-keeping was disastrously inadequate.' </p> <p>In 1998 it was revealed that CWC had dozens of incorrect addresses. The company admitted to eight incidents of inadequate information being passed to the emergency services. Oftel subsequently said it was 'now satisfied' with CWC's address records. </p> <p>Still only BT routinely provides Oftel with data on matters such as misdirected calls. The other two supply it on request. Oftel wants this formalised, but six months since Rafferty first spoke out, no code has yet been agreed.</p>",

Romania kick off and we can expect everything to go through the shaven-headed Hagi.<br></p> <p><strong>2</strong> A free kick from the right for Italy, taken by Cannavaro, easily claimed by Stelea in the Romanian goal.<br></p> <p><strong>5</strong> An early ball over the top by Totti seeks out Inzaghi, who (surprise, surprise) has wandered oh... 20 yards offside. Learn the rules, boy!<br></p> <p><strong>8</strong> Mister Sitter. Fiore, played in by Totti on the left, squares to the offside specialist, Inzaghi, who contrives to miss the target from 10 yards. Italians everywhere will be shaking their heads in amazement.<br></p> <p><strong>11</strong> Hagi stands over a free kick 30 yards out centre-left. His rising drive clears the four-man wall by 10 feet and 21 players stare at the ball sail into the crowd, whilst Hagi stares at the ground.<br></p> <p><strong>13</strong> Stelea almost handles outside his area, but some sleight-of-hand ensures that the Romanian keeper gets away with it.<br></p> <p><strong>14</strong> A cross delivered by Hagi on the left, aimed at Mutu. Two Italian defenders double-team to clear, but for the first time since their opening game against Turkey, the Italian defence looks suspect.<br></p> <p><strong>17</strong> The Romanians are giving away a lot of possession in their half of the pitch, which is ominous considering that they're playing Italy, not England. Romania already seem content to try and score on the break, letting the Azzuri come at them. A dangerous tactic, if ever there was one.<br></p> <p><strong>18</strong> A corner to Romania from the left, rolled out to Galca to have a crack. He does, and it's almost a carbon-copy of Hagi's earlier effort. A cow's arse and a banjo spring to mind...<br></p> <p><strong>22</strong> Conte released through the middle by Totti, who is playing a deeper, playmaking role. Stelea gets there just in time, and manages to find touch with his clearance.<br></p> <p><strong>24</strong> For a delicious second, Moldovan sees daylight between him and the Italian goal. Iuliano, the Juventus defender, ghosts in to dispossess the Romanian forward and the door is promptly slammed shut. The Azzuri looking more solid at the back. <br></p> <p><strong>27</strong> The game is slowing up and it needs an incident, a booking or something, to raise passions.

      "bodyText": "Italy: Francesco Toldo, Paolo Maldini (captain), Fabion Cannavaro, Alessandro Nesta, Mark Iuliano; Antonio Conte, Gianluca Zambrotta, Demetrio Albertini, Stefano Fiore; Filippo Inzaghi, Francesco Totti. Romania: Bogdan Stelea, Cristian Chivu, Liviu Ciobotariu, Iulian Filipescu, Miodrag Belodedici; Dorinel Munteanu, Florentin Petre, Constantin Galca, Gheorghe Hagi (captain); Viorel Moldovan, Adrian Mutu. Referee: Vitor Manuel Melo Pereira (Portugal) 1 min Here we go. Romania kick off and we can expect everything to go through the shaven-headed Hagi. 2 A free kick from the right for Italy, taken by Cannavaro, easily claimed by Stelea in the Romanian goal. 5 An early ball over the top by Totti seeks out Inzaghi, who (surprise, surprise) has wandered oh... 20 yards offside. Learn the rules, boy! 8 Mister Sitter. Fiore, played in by Totti on the left, squares to the offside specialist, Inzaghi, who contrives to miss the target from 10 yards. Italians everywhere will be shaking their heads in amazement. 11 Hagi stands over a free kick 30 yards out centre-left. His rising drive clears the four-man wall by 10 feet and 21 players stare at the ball sail into the crowd, whilst Hagi stares at the ground. 13 Stelea almost handles outside his area, but some sleight-of-hand ensures that the Romanian keeper gets away with it. 14 A cross delivered by Hagi on the left, aimed at Mutu. Two Italian defenders double-team to clear, but for the first time since their opening game against Turkey, the Italian defence looks suspect. 17 The Romanians are giving away a lot of possession in their half of the pitch, which is ominous considering that they're playing Italy, not England. Romania already seem content to try and score on the break, letting the Azzuri come at them. A dangerous tactic, if ever there was one. 18 A corner to Romania from the left, rolled out to Galca to have a crack. He does, and it's almost a carbon-copy of Hagi's earlier effort. A cow's arse and a banjo spring to mind... 22 Conte released through the middle by Totti, who is playing a deeper, playmaking role. Stelea gets there just in time, and manages to find touch with his clearance. 24 For a delicious second, Moldovan sees daylight between him and the Italian goal. Iuliano, the Juventus defender, ghosts in to dispossess the Romanian forward and the door is promptly slammed shut. The Azzuri looking more solid at the back. 27 The game is slowing up and it needs an incident, a booking or something, to raise passions. The ball has been pinging around the midfield for a few minutes now. 29 Totti picks out Inzaghi wide right and miraculously onside. His first-time cross is a good one and Fiore, with more time that he thought he had, slashes at the half-volley with comical results. Last time I looked the ball was still rising... 29m 30s It's started coming down now. 32 Totti again the provider, a long, high ball for Inzaghi to chase. Belodedici, beaten for pace, betters the Italian with brawn. If the Italians try that five, six times, eventually it'll work. But Inzaghi'll probably miss anyway. 33 GOAL! Italy 1 - 0 Romania So clinical. A cross is cleared by Belodedici as far as Fiore centre-left, who chips it back in to Totti on the left of the Romanian area. A chest, an elegant sweep with the right leg and the ball disappears under Stelea as Totti disappears under a pile of blue shirts. 35 Almost the perfect retort by Hagi, played in by Mutu down the right. Confronted by an advancing Toldo, the maestro lobs the ball over the keeper only to be denied by the far upright. 36 Back down the other end now as Totti goes close to doubling Italy's lead, his right-foot flick shot just drifting wide of Stelea's left-hand post. 38 Albertini booked for an agricultural hack on Hagi. 40 Hagi latches on to a cleared cross, but he's still feeling the Albertini challenge and elects to pass the ball out to Galca. His piledriver from 25 yards just bends the wrong side of the left post with Toldo well beaten. 43 GOAL!!

      "bodyText": "William Hague is poised to outflank Labour on democratic reform by embracing a largely elected second chamber and sweeping changes designed to make the executive - and specifically the prime minister - fully accountable to parliament. The Tory leader is preparing in the next fortnight to publish a 25,000-word report prepared for him by a commission headed by the distinguished political scientist Lord Norton. The report, \"Strengthening Parliament\", is intended to make the Commons - currently often deserted - the focal point of British political life again. The Norton commission will recommend: \u0095 stronger select committees free of the control of party whips \u0095 new powers for the Lords to block the fast-growing use of subsidiary legislation \u0095 a requirement that the prime minister regularly open set-piece debates \u0095 television cameras to be given more freedom to film inside parliament and interview MPs inside the Palace of Westminster \u0095 the prime minister to be required to appear in front of select committees \u0095 prime minister's questions, which were made weekly by Tony Blair, to revert to a twice-weekly event \u0095 MPs to be given powers to scrutinise and even block items of departmental spending. The commission may also propose reform of the finance bill, which implements the Budget, so that scrutiny of technical and political issues is divided. More draft government bills would be subject to full scrutiny by experts cross-examined by MPs. The commission is also expected to recommend that select committees be given more resources so they are more closely modelled on US congressional committees. Committee reports would also be regularly debated in the Commons, forcing the government to give a full response to criticisms expressed by all-party bodies. Party whips would be banned from controlling membership of committees, giving MPs an alternative to seeking a career as a minister. Rules to ensure that ministers only made substantial announcements to the Commons, rather than on television or radio, would also be tightened. In a separate move, the Conservatives are now expected to support a second chamber in which half the members are elected. Sir George Young, shadow leader of the Commons, said this week that the Tories would support a higher percentage of elected members than the 30% maximum proposed by the Wakeham commission. Conservative MPs expect Mr Hague to increase the figure to 50%. Labour, fearing undue conflict between the Commons and a democratic upper house, appears to favour only 100 elected members. Although there will be some cynicism about Mr Hague 's plans in view of Lady Thatcher and John Major's treatment of parliament, the Tory leader believes the Commons' scrutiny role can be improved. Labour sources said it was easy for political parties to promise in opposition to make life difficult for themselves if elected, but then not to act on their promises.

My daughter travelled on a container ship from Thamesport to Montreal and back with Canada Maritime, booked through Strand Voyages. She had a wonderful time. There are passages to New York from Thamesport available through Strand Voyages and also The Cruise People. Good sailing Sandra West. \u0095 Strand Voyages (020-7836 6363) is the booking agent for various companies that run cargo boats. Ships to New York and Norfolk, Virginia, are full for the next few months. Montreal costs \u00a3995pp one way, for a 10-day journey via Antwerp and Le Havre. The Cruise People (020-7723 2450) has spaces to Staten Island from Thamesport costing approximately \u00a31,125pp in a double cabin. The boat can be picked up in Le Havre. This week's question We are considering travelling to Thailand in the first two weeks of October for our honeymoon. Will the weather be okay? Our plans are to fly into Bangkok and then travel onto Chang-Mai and Ko Samui. Any info?

Subs: Catkic, Tuncay, Yalcin, Ozkoylu, Kaya, Izzet, Derelioglu, Akman, Ercan. </p> <p>Referee: D Jol (Holland) </p> <p><strong>1 minute</strong> Kick off! After carefully playing the ball around, the Turkish defence then carelessly lose it. Immediately Dimas swirls in a fantastic cross to the far post which is headed behind. But from the resulting corner Coult climbs all over his marker. Free kick to Turkey!</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Turkey have their first effort on goal. But Okan's limp header goes well wide.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Rui Costa plays a one-two off Pinto and looks ready to let one go from 20 yards out - but then he's tackled from behind. It's a foul, surely? No, says the referee and Turkey break. So far the game has been fast-paced and attacking - there's no sign that either team are playing for a draw</p> <p><strong>10</strong> Figo makes his first contribution, out on the left. But after his cross is blocked he falls awkwardly while challenging for the bouncing ball. Fortunately for Portugal he seems OK.</p> <p><strong>13</strong> Portugal are doing all the pressing - with Rui Costa and Figo making magic every time they get the ball. Figo again drifts out onto the left but his cross drifts just past the back stick. </p> <p><strong>15</strong> So far there's been plenty of good football but not many chances. Rui Costa wins a corner. The ball in looks dangerous, but Recber comes out and makes the best take of the tournament.</p> <p><strong>17</strong> Turkey aren't playing badly, but Portugal are having all the possession. Rui Costa - the man's everywhere at the moment! - fires in a shot with dangerous intent but it is blocked by Okan.</p> <p><strong>20</strong> A corner comes in and the ball drops to Costinha six yards out. Time seems to stand still. He must score. No!!!! It's brilliantly saved by the Galatasaray reserve keeper Recber, who has to receive treatment for an injury he's sustained around the rib-cage.</p> <p><strong>24</strong> Figo dribbles it past two Turkish defenders - with skill rarely since Stanley Matthews retired - and then leashes a 25 yard shot which goes just wide. It's all Portugal at the moment. Surely a goal can't be far away?</p> <p><strong>27</strong> At last Turkey get a respite and win a free kick about 40 yards out. The ball's launched in and Victor Baia hesistates. It's coming straight to Hakan Sukur, 15 yards out. Can he get it on target? Oh no his header's gone over.</p> <p><strong>28</strong> Yellow card! Joao Pinto is the culprit. But the Turkish fellow dived and then rolled about five times, and the decision was definitely harsh.</p> <p><strong>30</strong> RED CARD!!! Alpay is sent off for aiming a punch a Cuoto. No contact is made whatsoever, but Cuoto clutches his nose like he's been pole-axed by Mike Tyson.</p> <p><strong>32</strong> Yellow card! Okan is booked for a foul. The Turks look unhappy. And who can blame them - they've weathered the Portuguese storm and now they're down to 10 men.</p> <p><strong>34</strong> Turkey have definitely changed their formation following the sending-off. They've now playing a 4-3-2 rather than their usual 3-5-2.</p> <p><strong>36</strong> All credit to Turkey - they are tackling like demons and still coming forward. Arif exchanges a delicious one-two with Hakan Sukur, but he's just offside. If anything Turkey have had their best spell since they were reduced to ten men.</p> <p><strong>38</strong> Yellow card! Cuoto is booked for Portugal. Anyone who has bought the number of bookings and sending offs in this game would have made a fortune by now!</p> <p><strong>39</strong> Yellow card!. Rui Costa for dissent to linesman. </p> <p><strong>40</strong> Another yellow card!! This time it's Costinha. Did anyone mention a house in Barbados?</p> <p><strong>42</strong> Portugal get a corner. Recber goes on one of his first game walkabouts but Costinha fluffs his header - from six yards - just wide. He could have scored two by now!</p> <p><strong>43</strong> GOAL! Portugal take the lead!!!! A perfect cross is flighted in from Figo and Gomes cushions in a terrific header in from eight yards. </p> <p><strong>45</strong> And it's very nearly two. Figo plays it to Rui Costa who coasts past a defender and gets to the touchline. But Joao Pinto misses from eight yards.</p> <p><strong>First half injury time</strong> There's supposed to be four added minutes, but a clash of heads means that it will go on several minutes longer. Suddenly Couto challenges Arif and it's a penalty to Turkey!!! Did Cuoto get a touch on the ball? Quite possibly, but it was very risky sliding in from behind. So it will be Arif to step up. Can he level the scores?</p> <p><strong>NO!!!!!</strong> Victor Baia has saved it!!! Arif smashes it straight down the middle and Baia blocks it brilliantly. The ball drops to Sukur, but under a challenge from Cuoto he can't control it and Baia cleans up. </p> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> Portugal 1 Turkey 0. Five yellow cards, a sending-off and a missed penalty! All-in-all not a bad half.</p> <p><strong>46</strong> Substitution: Paolo Sosa is on for Costinha </p> <p><strong>49</strong> Figo lays it off to Rui Costa - but his shot is heroically blocked. The resulting corner is cleared, but immediately Portugal get it straight back, and Figo scampers down the left and drills in a lovely low cross which Gomes is only inches away from. </p> <p><strong>51</strong> Turkey get a corner which Baia flaps at hopelessly. The ball drops to Akyel about six yards out, but from a difficult position his shot goes over.</p> <p><strong>54</strong> Another Portugal corner. It's cleared to Arif who takes it past three players before he is tackled.</p> <p><strong>55</strong> GOAL!!!! 2-0 Portugal. Figo pops on the right, plays it beautifully past Unsal and then takes it into the box. He has time to look up before rolling a ball across the six-yard box to Gomes who makes no mistake.</p> <p><strong>57</strong> Turkey's heads are going down - and they have only got 10 men. Surely it's all over now. </p> <p><strong>59</strong> And it's nearly 3-0. Pinto fires just wide from 20 yards.</p> <p><strong>60</strong> Yellow card! Paulo Sosa gets one for a nothing challenge. Is the referee trying to beat some kind of record? Call Norris MacWhirter now, because he might be needed.</p> <p><strong> 62</strong> Turkey make two substitutes: Arif for Suat and Oktay for Okan. </p> <p><strong>64</strong> It's becoming too easy for Portugal now. Rui Costa and Figo are irresistible - well certainly for the Turkish defence at any rate - and fine player from the former sets up Gomez 20 yards out. Will he score a hat-trick? Not with a shot like that he won't....</p> <p><strong>67</strong> What a miss!!! Portugal get a corner and the ball is flicked on to Paulo Sosa, three yards out. There's no Turk near him, and he must score....but instead he fluffs the ball across the goal and Gomes is unable to pick up the pieces. </p> <p><strong>70</strong> Again Gomes misses a chance of a hat-trick. Figo is producing Beckham-like crosses for fun at the moment. But Gomes knocks it wide from six yards. </p> <p><strong>72</strong> Portugal have got the extra man and they're stretching Turkey all over the place. It's all too easy. Enterprising play sets up Rui Costa for a volley from 20 yards out, but it's well saved.</p> <p><strong>74</strong> Portugal substitute: Sa Pinto comes on for Gomes.</p> <p><strong>76</strong> And he immediately runs 50 yards without a challenge. But his shot from 20 yards is easily saved. Luis Figo, who ran half the length of the pitch to support him does not look at all happy.</p> <p><strong>78</strong> Turkey ,make a rare excursion into the Portuguese half - but the cross goes over Sukur's head.</p> <p><strong>79</strong> Turkey win a free kick on the corner of the penalty box. It's curled in towards goal, but it hits Dimas and Baia clears up. Turkey are definitely coming into the game a little bit more as Portugal drop back - but surely it's too late. </p> <p><strong>82</strong> Yellow card! Ogan gets one for confronting the assistant referee. </p> <p><strong>83</strong> Baia fluffs his clearance straight to Hakan Unsal about 40 yards out. Will he try a Beckham? Oh yes he does, but it just floats over the bar. Baia just about had it covered though...</p> <p><strong>84</strong> Turkey substitute: Sergen comes on for Ogun.</p> <p><strong>88</strong> It's like an exhibition match now. Every time Portugal attack it's three against three. All credit to Turkey though, they are still coming forward and Baia has to react smartly to smother a cross. Can't see it being another Spain v Yugoslavia though...</p> <p><strong>90</strong> Figo free kick 25 yards centre-left, hits the wall and the maestro drills the ricochet swerving and dipping just over the bar.<br></p> <p><strong>92</strong> Full time: Portugal 2 - 0 Turkey. On the balance of play, the better team won. Portugal will have to play better in the semi-finals.</p>",

But who cares, so long as it works? \"There are no grammar exercises and no vocabulary tests,\" say the publishers of these guides. \"Just the words and phrases you want to know.\" We grown-ups have a name for such things, of course. We call them phrasebooks. But where grown-up phrasebooks have chapters called \"Arriving\", \"Ordering dinner\" and \"At the bureau de change\", these versions, aimed at nine- to 12-year-olds, have \"Hanging out\", \"Looking good\" and \"Wanna play?\" There are sections on beach talk (\"Is this your bucket?\"), spending pocket money (\"This is rubbish\") and electronic games - how many adult phrasebooks contain the words \"Am I dead?\"?",

But my experience with these two, and a great many after them, has led me to believe that the calm exterior of the British woman conceals something really more adventurous than one ever suspects. </p> <p>The story begins when I got into conversation with Miss B and Lady D. Miss B was telling the story of the Willow Tearoom plate and it was very sweet and just what I would have suspected from the trim, boyish-looking young woman...</p> <p>Our conversation covered many things, and it came out somehow that I was interested in adventures. Suddenly Lady D looked steadily through her lorgnette at her friend and said: \"You know, we have just time to take her to the most wonderful of all adventures.

I learned little. \"Even if we could tell you,\" said Lady B, \"it would be useless. But you may believe that it is an experience which you will never forget and which, in your turn, you will never be able to describe.\" </p> <p>She was right... </p> <p>I insisted that Miss B go first, and I remember almost better than any other moment in my life the next 20 minutes or so while I sat alone in that strange place wondering. </p> <p>I heard almost nothing through the thick curtains that concealed the door through which she had passed, but there was a strange whining sound, like music. It reminded me of a violin, playing far away. Sometimes, when the sound was more distinct, I would feel a slight perspiration and a shiver. It is hard to explain. </p> <p>After a while, there was dead silence. </p> <p>Finally I heard the shuffling of slippers, and the curtain was drawn back. It was Miss B returning. </p> <p>She was staring straight ahead of her. She did not see me. Her eyes were dilated, her face was flushed. She seemed in a trance. It was as though she had taken a powerful drug. What was it? I almost decided to run away, but the old woman was motioning to me, and I felt obliged to follow her through the door into darkness. </p> <p>I say darkness. That is not exact. There was the soft glow of a lamp... a single flame burning like a soul. It made shadows on the carved ivory panels of the walls. The shadows flickered over a large Chinese bed in the room's centre. There was a grass mat on the floor, and absolutely nothing else in the place. The one window back of the bed was covered by an impenetrable curtain. There was not a sound. </p> <p>The old woman's hands were held out for my robe. Frightened to refuse, I gave it to her, but I was terrified to give it. It seemed as thought my last defence... against a mysterious, imagined something... were being taken away. </p> <p>She softly pushed me to the bed and motioned me to lie down. I did, as if I were hypnotised. Naked I lay out straight on my back, across the bed, I could see nothing but the flickering shadows of the lamp, and the old woman departing. </p> <p>Then suddenly there was some one in the room. I had not seen him come in. It was an old man, a very old man, with a thin, wax-like face. </p> <p>Almost without a sound, he shuffled in silken slippers over towards me, stopped about two yards from the bed, and peered at me in silence. His hands were folded under his large sleeves. His eyes glowed and picked up the light of the lamp from in back of me. </p> <p>Then, still looking fixedly at me, he unfolded his arms and brought out from somewhere a small stringed instrument with an abnormally long neck. He sat down cross-legged on the floor, turned his back on me, and began to play. </p> <p>That first note... it was as though it were drawn from my heartstrings. It was as though something in me were being played with a bow. It drew from the vitals of my life and being and plunged me into a voluptuousness that cannot be described. </p> <p>It was as though invisible hands were touching me and pouring a rich current of electricity through me and into me. My eyes closed, my body relaxed. Like a million hands pressing my body, torturing me with a delicious torture, that sound... or was it music?... enwrapped me and carried me out of myself into an orgy of physical hysteria. </p> <p>No, I cannot explain it. I cannot make myself clear. It was not alone sexual, not alone sensual. It transcended every and all physical pleasure I have ever known... Faster and faster and more rich the sound came from the little man's hands, rhythm after rhythm consumed me and lighted fires of passion and madness in me that are unspeakable, unfathomable. </p> <p>Then it stopped... </p> <p>I hardly regained complete understanding of actual life again until I was being led downstairs by Miss B, whose arm was tightly around me, guiding me and bracing me for fear that I fall. I tried to speak, to ask questions, but I found no voice. I felt myself being led out to the waiting chair and carried off by our coolies.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Matamanoa, Gili Trawangan, Alor and Pamalican are some of the most exotic holiday destinations in the world, home to glorious white-sand beaches, sparking crystal-clear seas and a stunning array of coral and sea life. </p> <p>Many people would jump at the chance to sample the delights they have to offer. A good proportion of them would think twice, however, when they discover they are in Fiji, Indonesia, Timor and the Philippines respectively. </p> <p>All of these countries are in the headlines for the wrong reasons - coups, sectarian violence, civil unrest, separatist uprisings, kidnapping of tourists, terrorism. From the comfort of an armchair in England, they all seem very good arguments for finding an alternative place to spend one's hard-earned money. </p> <p>And perhaps neighbouring countries should also be included on the exclusion list. Remember, the 21 people being held hostage by Muslim separatist guerrillas in the southern Philippines were actually in Malaysia, on the resort island of Sipaden, when they were seized. </p> <p>On closer inspection, though, dismissing out of hand countries in conflict means you could be missing out on a perfectly safe holiday at greatly-reduced rates. Unrest, quite naturally, breeds panic among holidaymakers who tend to flee at the first sign of trouble. But more often than not it is only a very small area that is engulfed by the upheaval. </p> <p>\"We were totally unaffected by the coup and, as we do not have TVs or radios in guest rooms, most people had no idea what was going on,\" says Reginald Raffles, who owns a resort on the remote Mamanuca islands in Fiji, in reference to the coup in the capital Suva on May 19. \"Our guests stayed on. But we were hit hard by cancellations from people due to come in.\" </p> <p>Mark McWhinnie, the manager of the Sheraton Fiji on Denarau island, who had the same problem, believes most tourists act far too hastily. \"For example, Bali emptied out when there were riots and civil disorder in Jakarta [in May 1998]\" he says. \"In people's perception, it's dangerous because they lump it all together as one country and don't study the issues more carefully.\" </p> <p>The occupancy rates at both resorts are currently a third of what they should be and so, with a bit of patience and determined negotiating, I was able to get discounts of up to 50%. Paradoxically, though, it is often the case that the more expensive the hotel, the smaller the discount in percentage terms. Upmarket resorts want to protect their brand name and maintain standards. </p> <p>When Lombok, the island immediately to the east of Bali in Indonesia, descended into a maelstrom of sectarian violence for three days at the end of January, the tourist market was ruined. Five months on and even the best hotels are struggling to reach 60% occupancy. \"However, I do not believe in slashing rates because I am offering a quality product that I know people are willing to pay for,\" explains Joe Polito, the manager of the Oberoi resort in Lombok. \"People will come back before too long.\" </p> <p>Polito recommends that people looking for a good deal - and there are still plenty to be had in Lombok despite there having been no unrest since the initial disorder - should head to non-chain hotels that rely solely on the destination and not also on the reputation of their product. \"It's these hotels that are finding it most difficult and are glad of any customers they can get,\" he said. </p> <p>While all three agree the danger to tourists is often exaggerated, they all stress that it is crucial to do one's homework before venturing to a potentially risky destination. \"I'm not going to suggest that people should take a risk, but if you're sitting on the fence then the best thing to do is to ring up where you're going and speak to people on the ground,\" McWhinnie says. </p> <p>Albert, an Austrian tourist I bumped into in January in the eastern Indonesian city of Ambon when covering an outbreak of sectarian fighting, had not done enough homework. He assumed a two-day lull meant it was all over and that, despite the city being partitioned and prone to random shooting, he would still be able to get a week's unimpeded diving. Twenty-four hours later, he was dodging the bullets on his way back to the airport. </p> <p>Embassy travel advisories are always worth checking but not always worth obeying, as Mandy and Andrew Nicklin found out. They got married on May 27 and had planned to spend part of their honeymoon in Fiji. Even though the Foreign Office advised against \"all but the most essential\" travel to Fiji, and suggested that all Britons there leave, they decided to go ahead with their trip. </p> <p>\"We thought we were going to have to change our itinerary,\" Mandy says. \"But we contacted the travel company which was saying that travelling round the [outer] islands as we were and not going anywhere near the capital Suva, where all the trouble was, should be okay.\" </p> <p>The Nicklins say their greatest problem was worrying about their parents worrying about what might be happening to them, even though they were telephoning home regularly. </p> <p>There are no hard-and-fast rules and no two conflicts are ever the same. But, particularly in countries as large and spread out as Indonesia and the Philippines, violence in one place does not automatically mean the whole country is on the verge of erupting into major unrest. </p> <p>Then again, you can always be unlucky and end up with a much longer \"vacation\" than you expected, as the Sipaden holidaymakers are in the unenviable position of discovering.</p> <p><strong>Troubleshooter's guide to staying safe</strong></p> <p><strong> 1</strong> Check how serious the unrest is. </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> Find out how safe your hotel is if the trouble has not stopped. </p> <p> <strong> 3</strong> Check your travel insurance covers you. Insurers are usually the most cautious of people. </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> Don't take too much local currency and ensure you have plenty of hard currency. In times of disorder, local currencies can fluctuate rapidly and massively. Many people rely on credit cards, but in many remote areas that have experienced unrest they are not accepted. </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> Make sure you have a safe exit route just in case the trouble escalates. </p> <p><strong> 6</strong> The better deals are likely to be found at the smaller, less well-known hotels and tour operators. </p> <p> <strong> 7</strong> Keep abreast of the FO's updated travel advisory. Available from the local embassy or high commission. UK tel: 020-7238 4503. </p> <p><strong> 8</strong> Don't switch off from the outside world. Buy a newspaper regularly and listen to the radio and TV news. </p> <p><strong> 9</strong> Keep in touch with family and friends back home. Remember they can't see what you're up to and so are likely to be far more worried than you. </p> <p><strong> 10</strong> Don't expect sympathy if you get shot, particularly if you ignore advice.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Matamanoa, Gili Trawangan, Alor and Pamalican are some of the most exotic holiday destinations in the world, home to glorious white-sand beaches, sparking crystal-clear seas and a stunning array of coral and sea life. Many people would jump at the chance to sample the delights they have to offer. A good proportion of them would think twice, however, when they discover they are in Fiji, Indonesia, Timor and the Philippines respectively. All of these countries are in the headlines for the wrong reasons - coups, sectarian violence, civil unrest, separatist uprisings, kidnapping of tourists, terrorism. From the comfort of an armchair in England, they all seem very good arguments for finding an alternative place to spend one's hard-earned money. And perhaps neighbouring countries should also be included on the exclusion list. Remember, the 21 people being held hostage by Muslim separatist guerrillas in the southern Philippines were actually in Malaysia, on the resort island of Sipaden, when they were seized. On closer inspection, though, dismissing out of hand countries in conflict means you could be missing out on a perfectly safe holiday at greatly-reduced rates. Unrest, quite naturally, breeds panic among holidaymakers who tend to flee at the first sign of trouble. But more often than not it is only a very small area that is engulfed by the upheaval. \"We were totally unaffected by the coup and, as we do not have TVs or radios in guest rooms, most people had no idea what was going on,\" says Reginald Raffles, who owns a resort on the remote Mamanuca islands in Fiji, in reference to the coup in the capital Suva on May 19. \"Our guests stayed on. But we were hit hard by cancellations from people due to come in.\" Mark McWhinnie, the manager of the Sheraton Fiji on Denarau island, who had the same problem, believes most tourists act far too hastily. \"For example, Bali emptied out when there were riots and civil disorder in Jakarta [in May 1998]\" he says. \"In people's perception, it's dangerous because they lump it all together as one country and don't study the issues more carefully.\" The occupancy rates at both resorts are currently a third of what they should be and so, with a bit of patience and determined negotiating, I was able to get discounts of up to 50%. Paradoxically, though, it is often the case that the more expensive the hotel, the smaller the discount in percentage terms. Upmarket resorts want to protect their brand name and maintain standards. When Lombok, the island immediately to the east of Bali in Indonesia, descended into a maelstrom of sectarian violence for three days at the end of January, the tourist market was ruined. Five months on and even the best hotels are struggling to reach 60% occupancy. \"However, I do not believe in slashing rates because I am offering a quality product that I know people are willing to pay for,\" explains Joe Polito, the manager of the Oberoi resort in Lombok. \"People will come back before too long.\" Polito recommends that people looking for a good deal - and there are still plenty to be had in Lombok despite there having been no unrest since the initial disorder - should head to non-chain hotels that rely solely on the destination and not also on the reputation of their product. \"It's these hotels that are finding it most difficult and are glad of any customers they can get,\" he said. While all three agree the danger to tourists is often exaggerated, they all stress that it is crucial to do one's homework before venturing to a potentially risky destination. \"I'm not going to suggest that people should take a risk, but if you're sitting on the fence then the best thing to do is to ring up where you're going and speak to people on the ground,\" McWhinnie says. Albert, an Austrian tourist I bumped into in January in the eastern Indonesian city of Ambon when covering an outbreak of sectarian fighting, had not done enough homework. He assumed a two-day lull meant it was all over and that, despite the city being partitioned and prone to random shooting, he would still be able to get a week's unimpeded diving. Twenty-four hours later, he was dodging the bullets on his way back to the airport. Embassy travel advisories are always worth checking but not always worth obeying, as Mandy and Andrew Nicklin found out. They got married on May 27 and had planned to spend part of their honeymoon in Fiji. Even though the Foreign Office advised against \"all but the most essential\" travel to Fiji, and suggested that all Britons there leave, they decided to go ahead with their trip. \"We thought we were going to have to change our itinerary,\" Mandy says. \"But we contacted the travel company which was saying that travelling round the [outer] islands as we were and not going anywhere near the capital Suva, where all the trouble was, should be okay.\" The Nicklins say their greatest problem was worrying about their parents worrying about what might be happening to them, even though they were telephoning home regularly. There are no hard-and-fast rules and no two conflicts are ever the same. But, particularly in countries as large and spread out as Indonesia and the Philippines, violence in one place does not automatically mean the whole country is on the verge of erupting into major unrest. Then again, you can always be unlucky and end up with a much longer \"vacation\" than you expected, as the Sipaden holidaymakers are in the unenviable position of discovering. Troubleshooter's guide to staying safe 1 Check how serious the unrest is. 2 Find out how safe your hotel is if the trouble has not stopped. 3 Check your travel insurance covers you. Insurers are usually the most cautious of people. 4 Don't take too much local currency and ensure you have plenty of hard currency. In times of disorder, local currencies can fluctuate rapidly and massively. Many people rely on credit cards, but in many remote areas that have experienced unrest they are not accepted. 5 Make sure you have a safe exit route just in case the trouble escalates. 6 The better deals are likely to be found at the smaller, less well-known hotels and tour operators. 7 Keep abreast of the FO's updated travel advisory. Available from the local embassy or high commission. UK tel: 020-7238 4503. 8 Don't switch off from the outside world. Buy a newspaper regularly and listen to the radio and TV news. 9 Keep in touch with family and friends back home. Remember they can't see what you're up to and so are likely to be far more worried than you. 10 Don't expect sympathy if you get shot, particularly if you ignore advice.",

      "body": "<p>When I told my mate exactly whereabouts in Spain I was taking the family on holiday, he visibly aged. </p> <p>\"Calpe, eh?\" he said. \"I've been there.\" </p> <p>Then he paused, the kind of pause that rarely prefaces a glowing endorsement, before adding: \"Worst holiday of my life.\" </p> <p>He tried for several seconds to be tactful, but out it all came: the catalogue of woes suffered there. The stifling concrete tower block, for instance, in which festered the shoe-box sized mosquito farm that served as his accommodation. Then there was the beach so covered in blistering flesh he had returned to England unaware if it was sandy or rocky. Oh, and on his one trip to a nightclub, there was a mass brawl involving a gang from Derby who had taken offence at the swanky, metropolitan behaviour of a group of lads from Leicester. </p> <p>\"Calpe,\" he concluded. \"Khazi more like.\" </p> <p>But my mother had booked a villa there, up in the hills overlooking the town and had invited us all along. She had been before and, unless she was keeping something from us, had yet to be embroiled in a territorial spat at the Club Paradiso or Bar Britannia. So there was no turning back. </p> <p>Twenty minutes' drive north of Benidorm, its more celebrated Costa Blanca neighbour, the guidebooks tell you that Calpe occupies a stunning scenic spot: a wide sandy bay, perfectly dissected by a huge limestone rock. Frankly, the scenery is not the first thing you notice. Back in the early 60s, it is said that all the first British package tourists to the place could see bobbing about at the base of the rock were the brightly- coloured fishing boats of the local fleet. </p> <p>Now, we discovered the moment we looked down on the town from the grand sweep of our villa's terrace, the town's main purpose appears to be to provide a laboratory for every architect of the brutalist school to put into practice theories discredited by social disasters elsewhere. Dozens and dozens of ugly concrete towers scar the bay. Whereas in Las Vegas, say, every hotel is themed to make a theatrical statement, here they seem to be designed solely to demonstrate the texture of the breeze block. </p> <p>And they are still building them, 20-storey holiday apartment complexes that look as though they must have taken all of minutes to plan. There are more cranes in Calpe than in the city of London, thrusting up the new engines of the local economy. Meanwhile, every inch of the surrounding hillsides has been covered in an ever- growing rash of white-washed holiday villas, quickly smothering all before it in suburbia. Day and night the air is filled with a constant cicada hum of drilling and hammering. </p> <p>Oddly, though, after the initial shock had worn away, as the days merged into a rioja and barbecue haze, the architecture grew increasingly less threatening. At night, as we stood on our balcony, the blocks provided a glittering light show, twinkling away beneath us almost benevolently. </p> <p>And we quickly discovered that the best view of the town was from the terrace of the Guitar Bar on the front itself. Not just because it offered a clean sweep along the shoreline to the mini Gibraltar of the rock. But mainly because the bar was located on the ground floor of the ugliest building around, so it was the only place in town where you couldn't see what you were sitting in. </p> <p>Besides we were having too much fun to be worried about aesthetics. Whatever the architecture, a resort takes on a completely different complexion depending on the time of year you visit. Blackpool is another proposition altogether in January compared with July. Mainly because it is empty. And more by fluke than forward planning, we had hit the jackpot. The brilliant thing, it turned out, about going to a popular Spanish holiday resort during the summer half-term is that everything is in operation, but the season has not yet cranked up to its full level of madness. Thus there are plenty of cheap flights, all the attractions are open, but nobody is there yet. </p> <p>And even Calpe has its virtues when empty. Take the beach. With only a few pensioners savouring the muscular buying power of their grey pounds scattered across it, this turned out to be a mile-long glittering stretch of clean sand. Every night it is vacuumed by municipal trucks to a condition so pristine, your chances of discovering a dog end are marginally lower than winning the lottery. </p> <p>Or there's the bars and restaurants, yet to be colonised by the fighting men of the East Midlands, which battle instead for your custom, sending out hit squads to accost your evening stroll, armed with jugs of sangria and comedy English. \"Yes, you, looky looky, free drink, lovely jubbly.\" </p> <p>Up in the mountains, the limestone harshness is softened by bursts of bougainvillaea, morning glory and lemons hanging in their thousands from the trees. The winding roads have yet to become impassable for the drifts of tourist coaches. And the weather is almost absurd in its perfection. Whereas in August the sun is so hot a short hop across the sand char-grills the feet, every morning in early June dawns a blissful combination of clear skies, a thermometer hovering around 80F and a cool breeze fanning in from the sea. </p> <p>But, best of all, there is Agualandia. Or, as the hoardings advertising its pleasures put it: \"The largest water park.\" There is no qualification as to whether it is the largest water park in the world, in Spain, or merely on the road between Calpe and Benidorm, but nonetheless it is some operation. </p> <p>In August, Agualandia is no place for a misanthrope. So heaving with humanity is it, my nephew once spent an afternoon there and managed to go on three slides. The rest of the time he spent queuing. Lining up at a theme park can be a depressing experience at the best of times. But when you are shuffling along for an hour behind an 18-stone, middle-aged man dressed only in a posing pouch, with Newcastle United's crest tattooed on each buttock, you can lose the will to live. </p> <p>In June, there are no queues. Though the occasional 18-stone, middle-aged man with Newcastle United insignia indelibly adhered to his lower regions is still in evidence. </p> <p>Agualandia is a paradise of waterslides and pools perched on a hillside overlooking the vista that is Benidorm, a place that makes Calpe look picturesque. From the top of one slide, you can gaze down into the town and wonder if that is the Queen Vic British pub serving all-day full English breakfast for 90 pence you can see down there. Or is it McAfferty's Irish bar with karaoke den and widescreen TV offering a full range of Sky Sports channels? </p> <p>When we went, though, there was little time to ponder such profound issues. With no queues, we shot down so many rides in such rapid succession that, by the end of the day, the seats of our swimming trunks were so smooth you could see your face in them. Or at least you could see your cheeks. </p> <p>Each ride has its own name. My favourite was Rapidos, a meandering white-water number negotiated in an industrial-sized rubber ring (\"you won't need a tyre dad, you've got a spare one already, hahaha\"). Hugo and Ellie preferred the Black Hole, a terrifying enclosed chute apparently designed to cull claustrophobics. Barney could not get enough of the Kamikaze, a vertiginous beast that thrusts you through the water at such speed it combines a white-knuckle ride with a course of colonic irrigation. What my wife liked best of all was the turnstile marked exit. </p> <p>She had her revenge though. She went shopping. The Costa Blanca is a paradise of ceramic-making. Every village in the hills is crammed with pottery shops, selling vast terracotta tubs for the sort of price your local B&amp;Q charges for a flower pot. In Calpe, there is a ceramics supermarket, churning out the stuff to accommodate every taste from those engaged by a couple of subtle sweeps of azure on an earthenware pot to those who prefer 7ft-tall ceramic cartoon ducks. With no other shoppers around to fur up the check-outs, she and my mother bought enough to fill a small stately home. As they grazed for pottery, the children kitted themselves out in straw sombreros the width of satellite dishes in lively shades of puce and lime. </p> <p>At the end of the week, as I stood in Alicante airport, thigh deep in breakables that could not be stored under any circumstances in the hold, watching my children swish round on luggage trollies wearing sombreros, I tried to wear an expression to suggest these were irony purchases, a knowing wink at Costa Blanca naffery. Judging by the way they wore them, though, the children thought they were the height of style, swish souvenirs of the perfect family break.</p>",

Back in the early 60s, it is said that all the first British package tourists to the place could see bobbing about at the base of the rock were the brightly- coloured fishing boats of the local fleet. Now, we discovered the moment we looked down on the town from the grand sweep of our villa's terrace, the town's main purpose appears to be to provide a laboratory for every architect of the brutalist school to put into practice theories discredited by social disasters elsewhere. Dozens and dozens of ugly concrete towers scar the bay. Whereas in Las Vegas, say, every hotel is themed to make a theatrical statement, here they seem to be designed solely to demonstrate the texture of the breeze block. And they are still building them, 20-storey holiday apartment complexes that look as though they must have taken all of minutes to plan. There are more cranes in Calpe than in the city of London, thrusting up the new engines of the local economy. Meanwhile, every inch of the surrounding hillsides has been covered in an ever- growing rash of white-washed holiday villas, quickly smothering all before it in suburbia. Day and night the air is filled with a constant cicada hum of drilling and hammering. Oddly, though, after the initial shock had worn away, as the days merged into a rioja and barbecue haze, the architecture grew increasingly less threatening. At night, as we stood on our balcony, the blocks provided a glittering light show, twinkling away beneath us almost benevolently. And we quickly discovered that the best view of the town was from the terrace of the Guitar Bar on the front itself. Not just because it offered a clean sweep along the shoreline to the mini Gibraltar of the rock. But mainly because the bar was located on the ground floor of the ugliest building around, so it was the only place in town where you couldn't see what you were sitting in. Besides we were having too much fun to be worried about aesthetics. Whatever the architecture, a resort takes on a completely different complexion depending on the time of year you visit. Blackpool is another proposition altogether in January compared with July. Mainly because it is empty. And more by fluke than forward planning, we had hit the jackpot. The brilliant thing, it turned out, about going to a popular Spanish holiday resort during the summer half-term is that everything is in operation, but the season has not yet cranked up to its full level of madness. Thus there are plenty of cheap flights, all the attractions are open, but nobody is there yet. And even Calpe has its virtues when empty. Take the beach. With only a few pensioners savouring the muscular buying power of their grey pounds scattered across it, this turned out to be a mile-long glittering stretch of clean sand. Every night it is vacuumed by municipal trucks to a condition so pristine, your chances of discovering a dog end are marginally lower than winning the lottery. Or there's the bars and restaurants, yet to be colonised by the fighting men of the East Midlands, which battle instead for your custom, sending out hit squads to accost your evening stroll, armed with jugs of sangria and comedy English. \"Yes, you, looky looky, free drink, lovely jubbly.\" Up in the mountains, the limestone harshness is softened by bursts of bougainvillaea, morning glory and lemons hanging in their thousands from the trees. The winding roads have yet to become impassable for the drifts of tourist coaches. And the weather is almost absurd in its perfection. Whereas in August the sun is so hot a short hop across the sand char-grills the feet, every morning in early June dawns a blissful combination of clear skies, a thermometer hovering around 80F and a cool breeze fanning in from the sea. But, best of all, there is Agualandia. Or, as the hoardings advertising its pleasures put it: \"The largest water park.\" There is no qualification as to whether it is the largest water park in the world, in Spain, or merely on the road between Calpe and Benidorm, but nonetheless it is some operation. In August, Agualandia is no place for a misanthrope. So heaving with humanity is it, my nephew once spent an afternoon there and managed to go on three slides. The rest of the time he spent queuing. Lining up at a theme park can be a depressing experience at the best of times. But when you are shuffling along for an hour behind an 18-stone, middle-aged man dressed only in a posing pouch, with Newcastle United's crest tattooed on each buttock, you can lose the will to live. In June, there are no queues. Though the occasional 18-stone, middle-aged man with Newcastle United insignia indelibly adhered to his lower regions is still in evidence. Agualandia is a paradise of waterslides and pools perched on a hillside overlooking the vista that is Benidorm, a place that makes Calpe look picturesque. From the top of one slide, you can gaze down into the town and wonder if that is the Queen Vic British pub serving all-day full English breakfast for 90 pence you can see down there. Or is it McAfferty's Irish bar with karaoke den and widescreen TV offering a full range of Sky Sports channels? When we went, though, there was little time to ponder such profound issues. With no queues, we shot down so many rides in such rapid succession that, by the end of the day, the seats of our swimming trunks were so smooth you could see your face in them. Or at least you could see your cheeks. Each ride has its own name. My favourite was Rapidos, a meandering white-water number negotiated in an industrial-sized rubber ring (\"you won't need a tyre dad, you've got a spare one already, hahaha\"). Hugo and Ellie preferred the Black Hole, a terrifying enclosed chute apparently designed to cull claustrophobics. Barney could not get enough of the Kamikaze, a vertiginous beast that thrusts you through the water at such speed it combines a white-knuckle ride with a course of colonic irrigation. What my wife liked best of all was the turnstile marked exit. She had her revenge though. She went shopping. The Costa Blanca is a paradise of ceramic-making. Every village in the hills is crammed with pottery shops, selling vast terracotta tubs for the sort of price your local B&amp;Q charges for a flower pot. In Calpe, there is a ceramics supermarket, churning out the stuff to accommodate every taste from those engaged by a couple of subtle sweeps of azure on an earthenware pot to those who prefer 7ft-tall ceramic cartoon ducks. With no other shoppers around to fur up the check-outs, she and my mother bought enough to fill a small stately home. As they grazed for pottery, the children kitted themselves out in straw sombreros the width of satellite dishes in lively shades of puce and lime. At the end of the week, as I stood in Alicante airport, thigh deep in breakables that could not be stored under any circumstances in the hold, watching my children swish round on luggage trollies wearing sombreros, I tried to wear an expression to suggest these were irony purchases, a knowing wink at Costa Blanca naffery. Judging by the way they wore them, though, the children thought they were the height of style, swish souvenirs of the perfect family break.",

      "body": "<p>I am writing this on B\u00fcy\u00fckada, one of the Princes Islands in the Sea of Marmara. The American writer friend who introduced me to the island claimed once to have had sex with six Kurds here. They were workmen, apparently, who were restoring one of the beautiful old wooden houses (yalis) with which the island is covered. He was passing, he caught their eye, or they caught his, and the rest is history. </p> <p>Gays have a secret language to which heterosexuals appear not to be privy. We were walking down the hill to dinner when we passed the yali in question. He pointed it out, first drawing my attention to the elaborate fretwork carving of the balcony, then he told me about the Kurds with their beautiful blue eyes. I said, \"Six? What, all at once?\" \"No, of course not, silly. One after the other.\" </p> <p>I have never had sex on B\u00fcy\u00fckada. I've never even come near it, unless the charming hotel manager coming to meet me off the late boat from Bostanci because he thought I shouldn't walk the 200 yards to the hotel alone counts as anything more than gallantry. Yet B\u00fcy\u00fckada is one of the most romantic places in the world. </p> <p>There are no cars here (except for a garbage truck and one, or maybe two, police vans). You go everywhere by horse-drawn carriage - a surrey with a fringe on top, like the one immortalised by the song in Oklahoma - drawn by pairs of matched bays or greys. The only sounds you hear are the clip of the horses' hooves; the clinking of the reins; the querulous-teething-baby cries of the seagulls; the strangulated screams of the fighting or mating cats (these two are often indistinguishable); and the fog-horn call of boats arriving and departing all day long from dawn until midnight. All you smell is sea and jasmine and grilling meat and fish. </p> <p>If you look across the Sea of Marmara, on a clear day, you can see the angular silhouettes of Bostanci, Maltepe and Kartal, those densely-populated, intensively built-up outer suburbs of Istanbul; they look like a larger, less elegant Manhat tan, and seem alarmingly near. I prefer it when it's hazy, like today, and the Asian shore looks far away. There's a point at dusk, before the million lights on the far coast are turned on, when the sea and sky merge to become one, and there's just a wall of grey-blue. </p> <p>But enough of B\u00fcy\u00fckada - whose erotic potential I am clearly not destined to experience (at least, not on this trip). That's the whole point. You can't plan your erotic travel. If you do, you're just a sexual tourist and that's not the same thing at all. Travellers are looking for adventure, and some are prepared to be more adventurous than others. \"Relief\", or titillation for his jaded palate, is the aim of the sexual tourist. </p> <p>What is it exactly about sex and travel? The one enhances the other. Both involve exploration and experimentation; linking the two is almost irresistible. A romantic and unusual, preferably exotic, setting compounds the thrill. The more exotic the setting, the greater the kick. It doesn't need to be about danger, though some travellers clearly find an element of risk a turn-on. </p> <p>In 1980, the Anglophile American scholar Paul Fussell published a book called Abroad. The book contained a chapter entitled L'Amour du Voyage, in which Fussell claimed that \"Making love in a novel environment, free from the censorship and inhibitions of the familiar, is one of the headiest experiences travel promises.\" </p> <p>The operative word here is \"promises\". The traveller, like the sexual adventurer (of whom some homosexuals seem to be the most daring - although some might think \"reckless\" a better word), embarks on his quest in the hope of encountering the unknown. Erotic travellers are, as the old song would have it, \"Strangers in the night exchanging glances/Wondering in the night what were the chances/We'd be sharing love before the night was through.\" For these lovers at first sight, love (and sexual adventure) is simultaneously just a glance away and many miles from home. The promise of a foreign affair, that enticing combination of the erotic and the exotic, can prove unbearably alluring. </p> <p>The trailer that advertises the video of the film version of Han Suyin's novel Love is a Many-Splendoured Thing promises that \"Passion loses control in exotic Hong Kong\". Implicit is the suggestion that uncontrollable passion and sexual adventure (even, with luck, depravity) beyond wildest imaginings, are possible only in such places as \"exotic Hong Kong\". But, in EM Forster's story The Obelisk, written in 1939, the travel undertaken by a schoolmaster and his wife is merely to an out-of-season seaside resort. Nonetheless, it leads to a chance encounter with two sailors, which in turn leads to sex, which leads to unprecedented perception, none of which would have been possible if the couple had not \"travelled\". </p> <p>I've enjoyed my share of love-making in exotic spots and understand all too well the relationship between the place, the moment, the situation and the person, which all combine mysteriously to create an atmosphere ripe for adventure. </p> <p>There's something magical about tropical countries: the strangeness, the dreamy warmth, the scent, the fact that no one in the real world knows where you are or what you are doing. In the right circumstances, that most depressing of encounters, the one-night stand, can seem positively thrilling. As the old poem has it, \"Wouldn't you like to sin/On a tiger skin/With Elinor Glyn?\" The tiger skin is the real attraction. </p> <p>I have always found the east - I suppose I might as well go all the way and call it the Orient - particularly evocative. I first understood its erotic potential in Canton, in a Ferris wheel that revolved slowly high above the city. Later that evening, back at a hotel on the banks of the Pearl River (the name alone evokes a kind of magic) with the sounds of the boatmen in their sampans on the water, all scruples were forgotten, all cares banished; London, other obligations, other people, everything ceased to exist. Only the moment remained. You can recognise such moments, not just afterwards when they linger in your memory with a crystalline clarity, but at the time, almost as if you have taken a drug that intensifies your senses - of smell, of sight, of hearing. </p> <p>My experience in China was followed by others - to the extent that I came to associate the Far East with a particular kind of erotic experience - and, when I was back in England with its monochrome colours and its gloomy climate, I would take out and examine my store of such memories rather as a miser might gloat over a secret hoard. The second time was on the Star Ferry pier in Hong Kong; the third in Raffles Hotel in Singapore. Raffles, in its last, great, seedy days before it was refurbished and lost all its character, was a real turn-on. </p> <p>I had just arrived from London. When I got to my hotel, a gleaming, modern skyscraper, I found a message telling me that an old boyfriend happened also to be in Singapore and was staying at Raffles. I caught a cab and went over. We had one drink, then another, and then dinner. Just as I was almost fainting with exhaustion, saying, \"I really must get some sleep,\" he said, \"Come and have a look at the Tiffin Room.\" </p> <p>The Tiffin Room, as far as I can remember, was a monument to colonial glory, festooned with stuffed tigers' heads and glass showcases containing reports of sporting triumphs.

I did give him the book, but that wasn't what he had meant. I had breakfast with him the next morning but, after that, I never saw him again. It didn't matter a bit.

In partnership with Rahul Dravid and Matthew Walker, who each made 37, the former England batsman's runs came off only 117 balls and there were nine fours as well as two sixes, hit over mid-on into the practice nets and over square-leg off successive Michael Bevan deliveries just before he was dismissed. A late flurry from the captain Matthew Fleming (22), who bats before Mark Ealham these days, saw Kent to a total of 215 for seven. Sussex Sharks, who like the Spitfires went into this fixture with a solitary win in the National League, were without their all-rounder Robin Martin-Jenkins, who was suffering from a side strain. In his place they played the all-rounder Michael Yardy, who was making his first competitive appearance for the first team.",

      "body": "<p>While for some, nothing less than a year in Provence would do, a few days pottering around a few sleepy towns and villages drinking cheap wine and soaking up the stunning weather is no less good for the soul. </p> <p>The area may be one of the most visited in France, but there is no sense of being exploited for the sake of a fast buck. Given that most of these places date back to times of distant antiquity, no one is in any hurry to get anywhere soon. </p> <p><strong> N\u00eemes</strong><br> </p> <p> N\u00eemes, with a direct flight to London, is as good a starting place as any. But while it has the world's best-preserved amphitheatre and a town hall dating from 5th-century BC, there is no escape from the ubiquitous king of the flat roof, Sir Norman Foster, even among some of the most enduring architectural triumphs of the Roman Empire. </p> <p>Opposite the Maison Car\u00e9e in the old town square, Foster has created an art gallery that takes its cue from the angular geometry both of the Roman forum and the terminal building at Stansted, which for many travellers to this part of Provence will have been their last glimpse of England. </p> <p>Recovery from this disconcerting realisation can be facilitated by a swift visit to the airy museum caf\u00e9 that, handily, provides a central base from which to strike out into the baffling maze of narrow streets and lanes fanning out from the centre of the town. </p> <p>N\u00eemes is one of those places where nothing much really happens. There are three festivals (ferias) every year (the latest one last month was a washout, much to the simultaneous distress and delight of locals whose fun was comprehensively spoiled but who now have something to moan about for the rest of the year). Apart from that, N\u00eemes is an austere, straightforward provincial town - quite an architecturally stunning one, it should be noted, but straightforward nonetheless. </p> <p>Given a fairly accidental kind of history, which means that there is no one characteristic that defines the place, N\u00eemes is somewhat less than the sum of its parts. Yet to miss out on some of these parts would be to neglect an insight into Roman history, which only a visit to the seat of the empire itself would otherwise provide. </p> <p>The amphitheatre, which is dated to the 1st century, may not be the largest in the Roman world, but locals boast that it is the best-preserved. Its 34 elliptical tiers once provided seating for 23,000, and the arena is still used for concerts, theatrical performances and the occasional bullfight.

      "bodyText": "While for some, nothing less than a year in Provence would do, a few days pottering around a few sleepy towns and villages drinking cheap wine and soaking up the stunning weather is no less good for the soul. The area may be one of the most visited in France, but there is no sense of being exploited for the sake of a fast buck. Given that most of these places date back to times of distant antiquity, no one is in any hurry to get anywhere soon. N\u00eemes N\u00eemes, with a direct flight to London, is as good a starting place as any. But while it has the world's best-preserved amphitheatre and a town hall dating from 5th-century BC, there is no escape from the ubiquitous king of the flat roof, Sir Norman Foster, even among some of the most enduring architectural triumphs of the Roman Empire. Opposite the Maison Car\u00e9e in the old town square, Foster has created an art gallery that takes its cue from the angular geometry both of the Roman forum and the terminal building at Stansted, which for many travellers to this part of Provence will have been their last glimpse of England. Recovery from this disconcerting realisation can be facilitated by a swift visit to the airy museum caf\u00e9 that, handily, provides a central base from which to strike out into the baffling maze of narrow streets and lanes fanning out from the centre of the town. N\u00eemes is one of those places where nothing much really happens. There are three festivals (ferias) every year (the latest one last month was a washout, much to the simultaneous distress and delight of locals whose fun was comprehensively spoiled but who now have something to moan about for the rest of the year). Apart from that, N\u00eemes is an austere, straightforward provincial town - quite an architecturally stunning one, it should be noted, but straightforward nonetheless. Given a fairly accidental kind of history, which means that there is no one characteristic that defines the place, N\u00eemes is somewhat less than the sum of its parts. Yet to miss out on some of these parts would be to neglect an insight into Roman history, which only a visit to the seat of the empire itself would otherwise provide. The amphitheatre, which is dated to the 1st century, may not be the largest in the Roman world, but locals boast that it is the best-preserved. Its 34 elliptical tiers once provided seating for 23,000, and the arena is still used for concerts, theatrical performances and the occasional bullfight. Those whose secret desire to witness such a cruel ritual is tempered by the thought of the suffering endured by our fellow beasts, may enter such an event at N\u00eemes with a clearer conscience: the local custom is that the bull is not fought to the death. For a slightly quieter life, the grand Jardins de la Fontaine - around which the old town of Nmes grew up - provide welcome shade from the afternoon sun, among the elaborate fountains created by the Romans to contrast with the arid nature of the surrounding area. N\u00eemes is undoubtedly the tourist trap of the region, and visitors should be prepared for the usual hordes of French schoolchildren or German families, depending on the time of year. Yet even on the busiest days, the crowds are dwarfed by the presence of this spectacular set of remains, to which admission is free. Hotels Hotel La France (+334 66 67 23 05), doubles from \u00a314 - the higher the room, the cheaper the price. Hotel Central (+334 66 67 27 75), doubles from about \u00a320.

Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts was a WWF champion in the early 90s. His two gimmicks - his evangelical delivery and the snake he carried into the ring in a sack and then hurled on the prone bodies of vanquished opponents - built his reputation as the most creative of heels (wrestling parlance for bad guys). The Roberts Blaustein tracks down and attempts to keep tabs on is a bloated crack addict, numbed by years of excess, spilling blood in front of a 65-strong crowd in a hall somewhere in Illinois. Tormented by regiments of personal demons, Roberts recounts grim tales of his mother, who married when she was 13, his numerous slain relatives and the father who treated him like a stranger. The movie then cuts to Roberts visiting his disapproving dad. Roberts' relationship with his own daughter is scarcely healthier. She berates him for his weakness and neglect. He flees after five minutes. Roberts is the wrestler who stayed on the road because he has no home to go back to.</p> <p>The nearest thing to a happy ending Beyond The Mat has to offer is in the case of Mick Foley. In his teenage years, Foley won the attention of wrestling schools through the 8mm movies his friends shot of him hurling himself off the roof of his house onto mattresses. His subsequent career as Cactus Jack saw him attain legendary status, less for his agility and innovative moves as his astonishing ability to absorb pain. In his New York Times No 1 bestselling autobiography, he recounts in not-for-the-squeamish detail how he lost most of his left ear, how he shattered every bone in his body and how the highlight of his career was when uber-heel The Undertaker threw him off the top of a 5m (16ft) cage resulting in a fall so chaotic, no one in the arena believed he had survived. For the climax of Foley's segment, Blaustein pulled a manoeuvre almost McMahonesque in its exploitative qualities. After showing Foley and family backstage conversing cheerfully with that night's opponent The Rock (then in his heel phase), Blaustein then cuts to the two men in the stage beating each other to a pulp. Rather, he shows The Rock slamming Foley repeatedly over the head with a steel chair. He then cuts to the reaction of Foley's wife and pre-teen son and daughter. He stays focused on their tears and screaming as Foley's wife escorts them from the arena while assuring them: \"Daddy's going to be all right.\" The Foleys are then shown several weeks later in their lovely Florida home watching the footage. \"I'm a bad dad,\" mutters a shaken Mick Foley.</p> <p>Though Foley later claimed that Blaustein had pulled something of a fast one, as his kids had been to plenty of his matches in the past, he was still supportive enough of the movie to help promote it. In this he was the lone WWF superstar (as the federation's wrestlers are all referred to). When Barry Blaustein began filming, the WWF was yet to become the all-encompassing media monstrosity it has subsequently become. Thus, Vince McMahon, desirous of any publicity for his company, which was then being drubbed in the ratings by the WCW \"Nitro\" show, permitted him all-access. In 1999, when the movie was amassing a pre-release buzz so favourable that Academy Award consideration seemed a possibility, the WWF was a very different proposition. \"Disney is the model,\" Vince McMahon has said, and often, of his gargantuan family business. He had no interest in promoting a piece of product that displayed the workers as all too human, as far from impervious to pain - and if Beyond The Mat is laudable for anything, it's because it puts paid to the myth that no one gets hurt - and over which he had no control. After first attempting to buy the film from Blaustein, McMahon refused to allow any names or images owned by the WWF to appear on any promotional material, which pretty much capsized its box-office prospects beyond the so-called \"smarts\" (fans who know it's all fake but somehow can't stop themselves getting worked up into a frenzy).</p> <p>As compelling a portrait as Beyond The Mat is of this peculiar ritual, there's also the sense that it documents an era about to end.

      "body": "<p>When Neil Webb completed England's 8-0 win over Turkey at Wembley in October 1987, Mustafa Denizli hardly felt like breaking into a series of cartwheels down the touchline. But as the coach leads out his team against Portugal this afternoon he will look back on that humiliation and smile. </p> <p>It is not that England are sinking beers on the sofa while his side play a quarter-final which fills him with glee. For Denizli the thrashing during his first spell in charge was pivotal to Turkey's progress. That it was a qualifier for the 1988 European Championship emphasises how far they have come. </p> <p>\"The fact that we lost 8-0 is very important in terms of creating today's success,\" he said yesterday. \"It motivated us very much. Turkey needed a change of philosophy and in England we lost the match but we gained a philosophy. Because of this I remember that match not as an 8-0 defeat but as the beginning of new horizons for Turkish football.\" </p> <p>An attacking mentality was established, the need for greater organisation and discipline taken in. Before departing two months later Denizli also attempted to make people believe. He pointed to the target of quali fying. Unless Turkey try to go somewhere they will always go nowhere, he said. </p> <p>Now, without question, they have arrived. Their display in Euro 96 was disappointing, their first tournament since the 1954 World Cup ending without a point or a goal. But here they have recovered from their initial stumbles, survived domestic pressure so intense that Denizli said \"you could lose your mind\", and given a fanatical country something to shout about. After Galatasaray's Uefa Cup triumph most Turks must be hoarse by now. </p> <p>That club success, coupled with their Euro 2000 showing, has confirmed Turkey as a growing force. The virulent criticism after the opening defeat by Italy has been all but forgotten. Then Denizli was told the football was \"incredibly dreadful\". One of yesterday's papers announced: \"You cannot stop Turkey.\" Another declared: \"Portugal are finished.\" There is rarely a middle ground. </p> <p>The players, on about \u00a385,000 each to reach the semi-finals, know millions will be watching and hoping. Turkey will grind to a halt and expectations are huge, but in certain respects the pressure is off. Having become the first Turkish side to reach a quarter-final they are unlikely to arrive back to a welter of rotten kebabs. </p> <p>Those who have followed the team closely say the players have been noticeably more relaxed since securing their place in the last eight. Yesterday morning they were seen signing autographs at their Amsterdam hotel. Some have been shopping. And Denizli, who had been tense, shared his thoughts on Thursday over coffee and cigarettes. </p> <p>Some wonder whether the team are too calm, feeling their job is done. But losing touch with the mood back home ought to be tough with Turkish television being beamed into the team's hotels. \"It's been amazing seeing the scenes in Turkey,\" said Leicester's Muzzy Izzet. \"It made you realise how much it meant.\" </p> <p>The fervour has apparently not reached the heights that greeted Galatasaray's European success. Club ties remain stronger than the national bond and after the win over Arsenal perhaps the bar has been raised. But at least one person was wounded in the celebratory gunfire that greeted victory over Belgium as Turkey took to the streets. And the expat community here, which runs into hundreds of thousands, is buzzing with excitement. </p> <p>Haydar Soylu, who runs the Omur hotel-restaurant in Rotterdam, epitomises the mood. Behind the bar hangs a picture of Hakan Sukur and upstairs today his coffee shop will be packed with people craning to watch the game live. </p> <p>\"If Turkey score,\" he says, \"I am frightened everyone will come crashing through the ceiling.\" </p> <p>Turkey's achievement here has been important not only in football terms but in integrating the country into Europe in a way politicians cannot achieve. And the European influence has been important in Turkey's sporting emergence. The arrival in the mid-1980s of the German coaches Jupp Derwall, who worked at Galatasaray, and Sepp Piontek, who was with the national team, is seen as crucial. So too the introduction of international stars such as Gheorghe Hagi and Gica Popescu. New methods and disciplines have complemented the Turkish technique and with each adventure the experience has grown. </p> <p>Today it is the wonderful technique of the Portuguese which has to be counteracted. Denizli has described them as \"the best team in the tournament\" but the Turks have the passion, the counter-attacking flair and the goals of Hakan Sukur to make this far from a foregone conclusion. Certainly Denizli will not be smiling if he is beaten 8-0 tonight. </p> <p> <strong> Turkey</strong> (3-5-2): Rustu; Fatih, Ogun, Alpay; Tayfun, Okan, Suat, Tayfur, Abdullah; Hakan Sukur, Arif. </p> <p><strong> Suspensions:</strong> None. </p> <p><strong> Portugal</strong> (4-1-4-1): Vitor Baia; Abel Xavier, Couto, Jorge Costa, Dimas; Vidigal; Conceicao, Rui Costa, Paulo Bento, Figo; Nuno Gomes. </p> <p><strong> Suspensions:</strong> None. </p> <p> <strong> Venue </strong> Amsterdam Arena, </p> <p>Amsterdam </p> <p><strong> Kick-off </strong> 5.0pm BST </p> <p><strong> Referee </strong> Dick Jol </p> <p>(Netherlands) </p> <p><strong> Head-to-head</strong> Portugal 4 wins, Turkey 1; draws 0 </p> <p><strong> Television</strong> </p> <p>Live on BBC 1 from 4.30pm <br> Highlights on BBC 1 at 12.35am. <br> Highlights on ITV at 2.20am <br></p> <p><strong> Radio</strong> </p> <p>Live on Radio 5 Live <br> Live on Capital Gold</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Neil Webb completed England's 8-0 win over Turkey at Wembley in October 1987, Mustafa Denizli hardly felt like breaking into a series of cartwheels down the touchline. But as the coach leads out his team against Portugal this afternoon he will look back on that humiliation and smile. It is not that England are sinking beers on the sofa while his side play a quarter-final which fills him with glee. For Denizli the thrashing during his first spell in charge was pivotal to Turkey's progress. That it was a qualifier for the 1988 European Championship emphasises how far they have come. \"The fact that we lost 8-0 is very important in terms of creating today's success,\" he said yesterday. \"It motivated us very much. Turkey needed a change of philosophy and in England we lost the match but we gained a philosophy. Because of this I remember that match not as an 8-0 defeat but as the beginning of new horizons for Turkish football.\" An attacking mentality was established, the need for greater organisation and discipline taken in. Before departing two months later Denizli also attempted to make people believe. He pointed to the target of quali fying. Unless Turkey try to go somewhere they will always go nowhere, he said. Now, without question, they have arrived. Their display in Euro 96 was disappointing, their first tournament since the 1954 World Cup ending without a point or a goal. But here they have recovered from their initial stumbles, survived domestic pressure so intense that Denizli said \"you could lose your mind\", and given a fanatical country something to shout about. After Galatasaray's Uefa Cup triumph most Turks must be hoarse by now. That club success, coupled with their Euro 2000 showing, has confirmed Turkey as a growing force. The virulent criticism after the opening defeat by Italy has been all but forgotten. Then Denizli was told the football was \"incredibly dreadful\". One of yesterday's papers announced: \"You cannot stop Turkey.\" Another declared: \"Portugal are finished.\" There is rarely a middle ground. The players, on about \u00a385,000 each to reach the semi-finals, know millions will be watching and hoping. Turkey will grind to a halt and expectations are huge, but in certain respects the pressure is off. Having become the first Turkish side to reach a quarter-final they are unlikely to arrive back to a welter of rotten kebabs. Those who have followed the team closely say the players have been noticeably more relaxed since securing their place in the last eight. Yesterday morning they were seen signing autographs at their Amsterdam hotel. Some have been shopping. And Denizli, who had been tense, shared his thoughts on Thursday over coffee and cigarettes. Some wonder whether the team are too calm, feeling their job is done. But losing touch with the mood back home ought to be tough with Turkish television being beamed into the team's hotels. \"It's been amazing seeing the scenes in Turkey,\" said Leicester's Muzzy Izzet. \"It made you realise how much it meant.\" The fervour has apparently not reached the heights that greeted Galatasaray's European success. Club ties remain stronger than the national bond and after the win over Arsenal perhaps the bar has been raised. But at least one person was wounded in the celebratory gunfire that greeted victory over Belgium as Turkey took to the streets. And the expat community here, which runs into hundreds of thousands, is buzzing with excitement. Haydar Soylu, who runs the Omur hotel-restaurant in Rotterdam, epitomises the mood. Behind the bar hangs a picture of Hakan Sukur and upstairs today his coffee shop will be packed with people craning to watch the game live. \"If Turkey score,\" he says, \"I am frightened everyone will come crashing through the ceiling.\" Turkey's achievement here has been important not only in football terms but in integrating the country into Europe in a way politicians cannot achieve. And the European influence has been important in Turkey's sporting emergence. The arrival in the mid-1980s of the German coaches Jupp Derwall, who worked at Galatasaray, and Sepp Piontek, who was with the national team, is seen as crucial. So too the introduction of international stars such as Gheorghe Hagi and Gica Popescu. New methods and disciplines have complemented the Turkish technique and with each adventure the experience has grown. Today it is the wonderful technique of the Portuguese which has to be counteracted. Denizli has described them as \"the best team in the tournament\" but the Turks have the passion, the counter-attacking flair and the goals of Hakan Sukur to make this far from a foregone conclusion. Certainly Denizli will not be smiling if he is beaten 8-0 tonight. Turkey (3-5-2): Rustu; Fatih, Ogun, Alpay; Tayfun, Okan, Suat, Tayfur, Abdullah; Hakan Sukur, Arif. Suspensions: None.

It is supposed to be of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rouart, but she is utterly overwhelmed by signs of her father. She stands in his study surrounded by his art collection, posing behind his chair, which is colossal compared with her, as if behind a restraining fence. She is diminished by the imagined presence of her father, who might be just outside the room - though actually he was travelling in Venice when this was painted. </p> <p>H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has a pasty complexion, her hair is flattened, her dress encases her. She lists like a passenger on a swaying deck. This is the ailing, unhappy daughter of a 19th-century patriarch, so subjugated to the fetishised, massive presence of her father - images of his taste, his wealth - that she seems half-dead. To her left is a landscape of Naples by Corot, and lower down a drawing by Millet, and she is juxtaposed with them as another of her father's treasures. To her right is the glass case containing her father's collection of Egyptian funerary artefacts. She too is mummified and entombed in this room. Degas makes H\u00e9l\u00e8ne show the ringless fingers of her left hand. The only man in her life, this painting says in a brutal way, is her father. </p> <p>Degas and women is a subject that's hard to get to the bottom of. There's a violence to this painting, but perhaps also an empathy. Degas expressed misogynist sentiments, yet was friends with the painter Berthe Morisot. This painting is from the period when Degas was turning away from the city crowd, towards a private erotic theatre staged in the studio and bourgeois interior. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne in this painting is a terrible contrast with the women stars of Parisian nightlife whom Degas painted in the 1870s as heroines of urban freedom.

      "bodyText": "\u00b7 View the work online Artist: Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas (1834-1917), an avant-garde artist obsessed with academic traditions; an intensely erotic painter and sculptor of women's bodies who was celibate; a modern man who was an extreme French nationalist and anti-Semite; and the most fascinating Impressionist after Manet. Subject: H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rouart, only daughter of Degas's friend, the rich painter and collector (and fellow rightwinger) Henri Rouart. Distinguishing features: This is a strange portrait. It is supposed to be of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rouart, but she is utterly overwhelmed by signs of her father. She stands in his study surrounded by his art collection, posing behind his chair, which is colossal compared with her, as if behind a restraining fence. She is diminished by the imagined presence of her father, who might be just outside the room - though actually he was travelling in Venice when this was painted. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has a pasty complexion, her hair is flattened, her dress encases her. She lists like a passenger on a swaying deck. This is the ailing, unhappy daughter of a 19th-century patriarch, so subjugated to the fetishised, massive presence of her father - images of his taste, his wealth - that she seems half-dead. To her left is a landscape of Naples by Corot, and lower down a drawing by Millet, and she is juxtaposed with them as another of her father's treasures. To her right is the glass case containing her father's collection of Egyptian funerary artefacts. She too is mummified and entombed in this room. Degas makes H\u00e9l\u00e8ne show the ringless fingers of her left hand. The only man in her life, this painting says in a brutal way, is her father. Degas and women is a subject that's hard to get to the bottom of. There's a violence to this painting, but perhaps also an empathy. Degas expressed misogynist sentiments, yet was friends with the painter Berthe Morisot. This painting is from the period when Degas was turning away from the city crowd, towards a private erotic theatre staged in the studio and bourgeois interior. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne in this painting is a terrible contrast with the women stars of Parisian nightlife whom Degas painted in the 1870s as heroines of urban freedom. His 1879 painting Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando, also in the National Gallery, has a woman flying in the air, alone and free in the open space above the crowd, hanging by her teeth from the trapeze. What a fall to earth is in this painting. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rouart, the well-behaved daughter of the bourgeoisie, is repressed, dulled in a way that Degas's proletarian performers are not. She's painted to make her as lifeless as possible: her hands drape weakly over the chair back, her face is passionless. This is middle-class depression, the crisis of the 19th-century individual that Freud would later diagnose. But it would not be true to say there's no desire in this painting.

The painting is suspenseful: possibilities, unacknowledged desires, circulate in its tense space, between the painter, the young woman and her father. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rouart married and left home soon after posing for Degas. As for Degas, he died 30 years later with this canvas still in his studio. Where is it?

      "body": "<p>Towards the end of Italy's training session in Geel on Thursday morning a frisson ran through the massed ranks of the Italian football media. As the players were preparing for the ritual mini-game that wraps up many sessions, all eyes were on the line-ups. </p> <p>Surprise, surprise: Alessandro del Piero was in the \"first XI\" and his erstwhile rival Francesco Totti was relegated to the reserves. It was too much for the man from Ansa, Italy's national press agency, to resist. By the time training finished Ansa had sent out a quick flash: \"Surprise in training, Del Piero not Totti\". </p> <p>As Italy prepare for their Euro 2000 quarter-final clash with Romania at the King Baudouin stadium in Brussels tonight, the nation's thoughts are focused on the Totti or Del Piero issue. It seems that for Italians a major football tournament is not worth the candle unless it engenders a furious, nationwide debate as to which of two contemporary stars should figure in the side. </p> <p>The tradition dates from the Mexico World Cup in 1970 when Internazionale's Sandro Mazzola and golden boy Gianni Rivera of Milan were judged incompatible by the coach Ferruccio Valcareggi. And in the 1998 World Cup in France, Del Piero was in a two-way battle for a place with the only contemporary Italian who could reasonably be considered even more famous (and wealthy) than himself, the \"Little Prince\" Roberto Baggio. </p> <p>As in 1970 and 1998, Italy's 56m-strong armchair army of potential national coaches want both their stars to play. Please, why not Mazzola with Rivera, Del Piero with Baggio, and now Totti with Del Piero? </p> <p>The enthusiasm for Del Piero is understandable. Likewise, one can only admire the cavalier tactical approach urged by an editorial in yesterday's Gazzetta Dello Sport, calling on the team coach Dino Zoff to start with a four-man attack led by Del Piero and Filippo Inzaghi, supported by Totti and Stefano Fiore. Admirable, but hardly realistic. Only in the most extreme of losing circumstances, and maybe not even then, would Zoff consider such an attacking quartet. </p> <p>No, for Del Piero fans the bad news is that Totti is almost certain to start tonight, once more relegating one of the world's highest-paid footballer to the substitutes' bench. If Del Piero plays, it will most likely be only as a second-half substitute, just as in Italy's opening Euro 2000 wins against Turkey and Belgium when he came on instead of Fiore and Totti respectively. </p> <p>It was the third of Italy's first-round games, their 2-1 victory over Sweden in Eindhoven on Monday, which poured fuel on the Totti or Del Piero debate. Zoff opted to field a side containing eight reserves, including Del Piero. He seized his chance in the best possible manner, scoring an 88th-minute left-foot winner straight out of the Roy of the Rovers school of prowess. </p> <p>\"It's true that after scoring that goal I felt an almost violent sensation,\" the Juventus player says, \"and that was because the goal meant a lot. The game against Sweden was a difficult one in that we were already into the quarter-finals, and therefore those of us who had played less than the others had to be sure to lay on a good show.\" </p> <p>The \"good show\" was delivered and the nationwide debate exploded. It is one ripe with the possibility for endless local polemics of the north v south, Juventus v Roma (Totti is Roma's captain) variety. Not for nothing, the front page of the Rome sports daily Corriere Dello Sport yesterday carried the headline, \"This is Totti's Italy\". Doubtless the Turin daily Tuttosport will respond this morning with calls for Del Piero to start. </p> <p>To the credit of both players, neither has indulged in polemics or tried to make life difficult for Zoff. Both want to play, obviously, yet both have spent most of Euro 2000 so far explaining what a good player the other is. \"I'm taking this whole thing calmly and serenely,\" Del Piero says. \"There is no war of nerves between me and Francesco.\" </p> <p>Non-Italian observers, confused by the sight of Del Piero on the bench, possibly underestimate two considerations. Totti, 23, is a supremely talented player, and Del Piero has spent much of this season on the comeback trail after a 10-month lay- off caused by cruciate ligament damage to his left knee in November 1998. </p> <p>Whereas Totti has played at close to his best throughout the season, Del Piero has made a slow journey back to full strength and sharpness. Intriguingly, however, Del Piero appears close to journey's end as Euro 2000 moves into the quarter-finals. His ability to glide past defenders, his free-kick skills and terrific natural touch are all back. One suspects that if he played for any other country he would line up not as a striker but as midfield playmaker. Significantly, in one Serie A game last season when Zinedine Zidane was unavailable for Juventus, Del Piero dropped back to appear in the Frenchman's playmaker role, doing so with total ease and to great effect. </p> <p>Zoff, however, does not want that type of playmaker. His choice is the talented Fiore, who tends to be more combative and mobile. Which leaves Del Piero and Totti to battle for a place up front and, in that context, Zoff probably believes Totti's greater physical strength gives him the edge. </p> <p>Cynics might argue that, if Del Piero is dropped again, he can console himself with his huge pay packet. He has estimated annual earnings, after tax, of $11m (\u00a37.3m), half in salary from Juventus and half from deals with such as Coca-Cola, Adidas and Walt Disney. </p> <p>Del Piero, too, is still only 25 and clearly there are other European Championships, not to say World Cups, ahead. However, the sight of him on the substitutes' bench brings to mind the day almost a year ago when he and Juventus concluded months of contract negotiations. Asked how he felt about being then the world's best-paid footballer, he replied: \"Money is important because it helps you to live better, but there are lots of things in life you simply can't buy.\" </p> <p>Starting with a guaranteed first-choice place in Dino Zoff's Italy team.</p>",

Footballwise there is a freshness and vigour about Euro 2000 appropriate to the game's first big occasion of the new century. </p> <p>The approach of most teams has been uninhibited and positive. From the moment Sweden and Belgium went for each other's jugular in the opening match it was clear that, if this was to be a cat-and-mouse tournament, it would be played in the spirit of Tom and Jerry. Sensible refereeing has helped, given the odd aberration with offsides and penalties. So far, from Pierluigi Collina downwards, yellow cards have been controlled and none of the few dismissals has warranted serious argument. </p> <p>The prospects for the knockout stages, then, are encouraging. It is never wise to pronounce judgment until the quarter- finals have been completed, but unless this weekend's matches become crabbed with a caution which none of those taking part has yet shown, there should be an improvement on Euro 96, when two of the four ties went to penalties after goalless stalemates, both semi-finals were settled in like fashion and the final was won by Oliver Bierhoff's golden goal. </p> <p>Such contrived conclusions can have a distorting effect on the plot, which would be a particular pity now since the intriguing set of group matches which have brought Turkey, Romania, Yugoslavia and Spain face to face with Portugal, Italy, Holland and France deserve a better outcome. </p> <p>Quite clearly France are the team to stop. Ever since the World Cup holders strode past Denmark, Roger Lemerre's team have been in little doubt about their destiny. Even the French reserves, while losing 3-2 to Holland in Amsterdam on Wednesday, managed to leave the Dutch wondering how they were going to compete with such an awesome depth of Gallic strength. </p> <p>Most of this weekend's quarter-finalists would find little difficulty in making a place for Johan Micoud in their midfields. Yet the 26-year-old from Bordeaux will only play a prominent part if Zinedine Zidane is injured or suspended. </p> <p>Maybe France's route to the final lies in a peninsula campaign. Victory over Spain tomorrow could see them meeting Portugal in Brussels in Wednesday's semi-final. The omnipotent look worn by the French in this European Championship offers a sharp contrast to the more diffident, more defensive initial approach of Aim\u00e9 Jacquet's side to the 1998 World Cup. Then, much the same set of players crouched behind sandbags looking to Laurent Blanc or Lilian Thuram to go on a recce when the coast was clear. </p> <p>What a difference it makes, being on top of the world. No team on earth, not even Brazil, knows how to strut its funky stuff like the French. Two years ago, even as the centre of Paris was thronged with celebrating fans, the sports daily L'Equipe still wished that Jacquet had triumphed with a greater sense of style. It is a reservation unlikely to be repeated should France win their second European title. </p> <p>All right, so Lemerre's team does not have a vein of gold at its heart to compare with the 1984 midfield of Platini-Tigana-Giresse. Yet to the foundations of 1998, built squarely on the goalkeeping of Fabien Barthez, the central defensive partnership of Blanc and Marcel Desailly, and the wit and skill of Zidane, has been added the attacking speed and scoring power of Thierry Henry. </p> <p><strong> Upset the odds</strong><br> </p> <p> So can anyone upset the odds and send France packing? Holland would be the choice of most people but the Dutch and French cannot meet until the final, and in any case Frank Rijkaard's co-hosts first have to see off Yugoslavia in Rotterdam tomorrow and Italy or Romania in Amsterdam on Thursday. </p> <p>Clearly, now is the time for Holland to shake off the fits of torpor which have been known to overtake them for odd periods. Certainly Yugoslavia, an ageing team maybe but worldly wise and ever alert to any opportunity, would look to punish any Dutch lapses of concentration. </p> <p>Savo Milosevic, the ambling Serb whom Aston Villa never really made out, is the leading striker of Euro 2000 with four goals. In his present form he is well capable of embarrassing Sander Westerveld, should Edwin van der Sar be unfit and should Liverpool's Dutch goalkeeper repeat Wednesday's error which gave France their opening goal. </p> <p>France would appear to have the easier route to the final. Spain's chances of stopping them in the quarter-finals will depend to some extent on how much beating Yugoslavia 4-3 in Wednesday's thrilling conclusion to Group C, while the French regulars were resting up, has taken out of Jose Camacho's players. Otherwise Gaizka Mendieta, the hub of their midfield, represents Spain's best chance of disturbing the realm of Zidane. </p> <p>The quarter-finals of this European Championship have a dangerously predictable look about them. A shock is overdue and it may yet be achieved by Turkey, who have already raised an eyebrow or two by knocking out Belgium, though the weaker of the co-hosts. </p> <p>While it is hard to believe that the combinations of Portuguese movement which tore England apart in Eindhoven will not find ways through Mustafa Denizli's defence today, there will surely be space for the Turks to exploit on the counterattack, and this is where Hakan Sukur, with his speed and power, can be most dangerous. </p> <p>Italy against Romania this evening is not easy to call either, and would appear to be the quarter-final most likely to go to penalties. If Demetrio Albertini and Antonio Conte can be got at in Italy's midfield then Dorinel Munteanu is surely the player to do it. Alternatively it may be a case of which defence cracks first, if any. </p> <p>A forecast for the semi-finals? Portugal against France and - sorry, Italy - Romania against Holland.</p>",

Even the French reserves, while losing 3-2 to Holland in Amsterdam on Wednesday, managed to leave the Dutch wondering how they were going to compete with such an awesome depth of Gallic strength. Most of this weekend's quarter-finalists would find little difficulty in making a place for Johan Micoud in their midfields. Yet the 26-year-old from Bordeaux will only play a prominent part if Zinedine Zidane is injured or suspended. Maybe France's route to the final lies in a peninsula campaign. Victory over Spain tomorrow could see them meeting Portugal in Brussels in Wednesday's semi-final. The omnipotent look worn by the French in this European Championship offers a sharp contrast to the more diffident, more defensive initial approach of Aim\u00e9 Jacquet's side to the 1998 World Cup. Then, much the same set of players crouched behind sandbags looking to Laurent Blanc or Lilian Thuram to go on a recce when the coast was clear. What a difference it makes, being on top of the world. No team on earth, not even Brazil, knows how to strut its funky stuff like the French. Two years ago, even as the centre of Paris was thronged with celebrating fans, the sports daily L'Equipe still wished that Jacquet had triumphed with a greater sense of style. It is a reservation unlikely to be repeated should France win their second European title. All right, so Lemerre's team does not have a vein of gold at its heart to compare with the 1984 midfield of Platini-Tigana-Giresse. Yet to the foundations of 1998, built squarely on the goalkeeping of Fabien Barthez, the central defensive partnership of Blanc and Marcel Desailly, and the wit and skill of Zidane, has been added the attacking speed and scoring power of Thierry Henry. Upset the odds So can anyone upset the odds and send France packing? Holland would be the choice of most people but the Dutch and French cannot meet until the final, and in any case Frank Rijkaard's co-hosts first have to see off Yugoslavia in Rotterdam tomorrow and Italy or Romania in Amsterdam on Thursday. Clearly, now is the time for Holland to shake off the fits of torpor which have been known to overtake them for odd periods. Certainly Yugoslavia, an ageing team maybe but worldly wise and ever alert to any opportunity, would look to punish any Dutch lapses of concentration. Savo Milosevic, the ambling Serb whom Aston Villa never really made out, is the leading striker of Euro 2000 with four goals. In his present form he is well capable of embarrassing Sander Westerveld, should Edwin van der Sar be unfit and should Liverpool's Dutch goalkeeper repeat Wednesday's error which gave France their opening goal. France would appear to have the easier route to the final. Spain's chances of stopping them in the quarter-finals will depend to some extent on how much beating Yugoslavia 4-3 in Wednesday's thrilling conclusion to Group C, while the French regulars were resting up, has taken out of Jose Camacho's players. Otherwise Gaizka Mendieta, the hub of their midfield, represents Spain's best chance of disturbing the realm of Zidane. The quarter-finals of this European Championship have a dangerously predictable look about them. A shock is overdue and it may yet be achieved by Turkey, who have already raised an eyebrow or two by knocking out Belgium, though the weaker of the co-hosts. While it is hard to believe that the combinations of Portuguese movement which tore England apart in Eindhoven will not find ways through Mustafa Denizli's defence today, there will surely be space for the Turks to exploit on the counterattack, and this is where Hakan Sukur, with his speed and power, can be most dangerous. Italy against Romania this evening is not easy to call either, and would appear to be the quarter-final most likely to go to penalties. If Demetrio Albertini and Antonio Conte can be got at in Italy's midfield then Dorinel Munteanu is surely the player to do it. Alternatively it may be a case of which defence cracks first, if any. A forecast for the semi-finals? Portugal against France and - sorry, Italy - Romania against Holland.",

      "body": "<p>A new scheme which claims to offer a lifeline to people worried about endowment mortgage shortfalls was this week being probed by investment watchdogs. </p> <p>Midlands-based company Mortgage Paid For Sure (MPFS plc) hired a London hotel on Monday to unveil its \"pioneering and unique\" solution to the endowment crisis. It offers homeowners worried their policy may not be on track to pay off the mortgage a guarantee that it will make up any shortfall in return for a fee of \u00a3175. </p> <p>But the scheme has prompted concern at the Financial Services Authority, the main City watchdog, which believes that in its present form it may breach the rules covering insurance business. As a result, the company has suspended its activities while an investigation is carried out. </p> <p>The MPFS scheme would, for a one-off flat fee of \u00a3175 irrespective of the size of the policy or how long it had to run, guarantee to make up any shortfall. But if there was a surplus when the policy matures, the firm would take 25% of this. And if the policy is surrendered before maturity, MPFS would take 10% of the surrender value. </p> <p>However, it is understood the Financial Services Authority believes the firm may not have the necessary backing from an authorised insurance company as required under the Insurance Companies Act. If a firm carries out this sort of business without authorisation it risks committing a criminal offence and any contracts it issued would be invalid. </p> <p>MPFS managing director John Webb says he was unable to find a Lloyd's syndicate or insurance company to underwrite the deal. Instead, he says, the plan was it would operate its own \"reserve fund\" from which any payouts would be made. </p> <p>He also disclosed that the Staffordshire-based company is not regulated by a watchdog such as the Financial Services Authority. Mr Webb said it did not need to be regulated because it is not giving financial advice. </p> <p>So one obvious question was: what happens if the firm goes bust in a few years' time, before my policy has matured - do I lose my money? Mr Webb's reply was that if it was to shut down, \"the worst case scenario is that the most anyone could lose would be that [\u00a3175] fee\". </p> <p>In other words, the answer to the question was quite possibly yes. On Wednesday night, Mr Webb said he had suspended the company's activities while the Financial Services Authority looks into the matter. </p> <p>The controversy comes as letters from insurance companies have been going out to millions of people, many of whom are being told their policies may not be on target to repay the mortgage. The Financial Services Authority has estimated that as many as 3m of the 10m policies may be in shortfall. </p> <p>What now look like over-optimistic assumptions about investment growth are at the heart of the problem. During the late 80s and early 90s, some insurers sold the policies using projections of future growth of up to 12% a year. </p> <p>But industry watchdogs now say these projections were too high. Last year investment watchdog the Personal Investment Authority set a new projection rate of 6% future growth per year. </p> <p> Many people are being told that their policies are probably on target if the old projection rate is used, but may fall short if the 6% growth figure is used. </p> <p>However, some commentators - particularly independent financial advisers - insist that a projection rate of 6% future growth per year is way too low. </p> <p>They point to a survey in Money Management magazine in April which revealed that for 25-year endowment policies maturing in February this year, the average gross annual yield was 13.1%. The magazine studied 34 different companies and found that even the worst performer in terms of yield, Equitable Life, achieved 11.9%. </p> <p>Some independent financial advisers say this shows that the 6% figure is very conservative indeed. But other experts argue that good performance in the past does not mean good performance in the future. </p> <p>People concerned that they may have been given poor advice regarding an endowment will be watching closely the case of a couple from London, who may be set to receive a payout from insurer Legal &amp; General on the grounds that they were wrongly sold an endowment. </p> <p>The case is currently with the Personal Investment Authority ombudsman, who has just issued a preliminary decision on the dispute in the couple's favour, and is understood to call on Legal &amp; General to repay all their endowment payments plus interest on the grounds that the salesperson did not properly explain the risks involved with investing in a stock market-linked product. </p> <p>Legal &amp; General can now either agree to pay up or can reject the decision - if it takes the latter route, the case will go to the ombudsman for a final decision. A Legal &amp; General spokesman says that as the matter has not yet been resolved, it does not wish to comment. </p> <p>If the couple win the case, it could open the floodgates to a spate of similar claims from people who say they were victims of mis-selling. </p> <p><strong>What you can do</strong></p> <p>If you are worried that your endowment policy may not pay off the mortgage, there are a number of things you can do. </p> <p>The number one piece of advice from the Financial Services Authority, the chief investment watchdog, is: \"Don't make any hasty decisions.\" It says you should never cash in your policy, or stop making payments, without taking advice. This is because endowments often involve high charges in the early years, and if the policy is only a few years old you will probably end up getting back less than you've spent. </p> <p>After taking advice, you may consider one or more of the following options: </p> <p>\u0095 Do nothing. While the predictions are for lower investment returns in the future, nobody can really be sure what will happen. You may be happy to cross your fingers in the hope that the policy makes the grade, particularly if your policy only just fails to hit the target using a projection rate of 6%, or if the potential shortfall is fairly small. </p> <p>\u0095 Increase your monthly payments into the policy. While this will probably delight your insurer, you may feel this amounts to throwing good money after bad. Also, with some companies it may involve you having to pay extra charges. </p> <p>\u0095 Contact your lender and arrange to change part of your mortgage to a repayment loan. This could be a much better option. For example, if your mortgage is \u00a360,000 and the potential endowment shortfall is \u00a310,000, you could rejig the mortgage so that \u00a350,000 continues on an interest-only basis and \u00a310,000 is converted to a repayment loan. </p> <p>\u0095 Set up a separate investment that can be used if necessary to meet a shortfall. One good way of building up a lump sum might be to go for an individual savings account. However, check carefully to see what the charges are. With many stocks and shares Isa providers, the minimum monthly investment is \u00a350 but in a few cases is as low as \u00a325. </p> <p>\u0095 If you have a spare lump sum, and your lender allows it, you could make extra capital repayments to your lender to reduce the amount you owe on the mortgage loan. Check for early redemption penalties. </p> <p>\u0095 Arrange for the policy term to be extended. \"This is not likely to be a good idea if the policy will continue after you have retired, unless you are sure you will still be able to afford the payments,\" says the FSA (<a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk\">www.fsa.gov.uk</a>). </p>",

Check for early redemption penalties. \u0095 Arrange for the policy term to be extended. \"This is not likely to be a good idea if the policy will continue after you have retired, unless you are sure you will still be able to afford the payments,\" says the FSA (www.fsa.gov.uk).",

But in many tourist destinations, the delicate ecosystems have been trampled under foot. And throughout Africa, Asia and South America, local people have become resentful because the land they once had free access to has been \"protected\". </p> <p>The earth has lost 30% of its natural habitat in the past 30 years. Tourism often makes life worse for wildlife and natural landscapes, but some tour operators are finding an eco-friendly alternative. Here are five wildlife holidays that fit the bill. </p> <p><strong>Kenya</strong><br> Eselenkei</p> <p> The Eselenkei Conservation Area is on Maasai tribal land in the shadow of snow-topped Kilimanjaro, a few miles north of Amboseli National Park. Unlike many safari areas in Kenya, the animals here are still very wild as the area is relatively unvisited. Tourist numbers are limited to eight a day to minimise the impact on the environment. </p> <p>Animals sighted within the Conservation Area include elephant, lion, leopard, cheetah and other cats, Thomson's and Grant's gazelles, gerenuk, impala, oryx, lesser kudu, zebra, wildebeest, giraffe, striped hyena, bat-eared fox, and ostrich. Birds of prey are also prolific. </p> <p>The range of animals is all the more amazing considering that the Maasai and wildlife have been at loggerheads in recent years. In 1984, the Maasai were evicted from their traditional lands in Amboseli to make way for conservation and safari tourism. The Maasai began killing animals thinking that it would stop the tourists coming and they would get their land back. </p> <p>A Kenyan organisation, Porini Ecotourism (in association with British tour operator Tropical Places), started working with the Maasai to find a solution. The Maasai tribal lands have been set aside as a private reserve for wildlife and the Maasai are now receiving a rent for the lease of the land from the tour operator plus an entry fee for each tourist visitor. They also benefit from employment as game scouts, road builders and workers at the luxury safari lodges. Profits are used for maintenance of boreholes, animal husbandry and education for the Maasai. Tourism is starting to work for, not against, them. </p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.tropical.co.uk\">Tropical Places</a> (0800 0185256) and <a href=\"http://www.porini.com\">www.porini.com</a>. Three nights, \u00a3299 plus flights. The Eselenkei Safari can also be combined with a stay at a Mombasa beach hotel. </p> <p> <strong>Galapagos</strong><br> Backstage wildlife cruise</p> <p> Discovery Initiatives has a new approach to nature travel. Every trip is arranged by liaising closely with a conservation group, research station or community project, which they pay to organise a specialist wildlife visit instead of using a local travel agent or ground handler. The visitor gets an \"backstage\" insight into the local wildlife and environment, and the environmental agency or community gets the money to further their conservation efforts or to invest in community welfare projects. </p> <p>In the Galapagos, you travel for 10 days on one of a variety of small, luxury yachts around the islands away from the ordinary tourist route. There's plenty of opportunity to see Darwin's finches, blue-footed boobies, the flightless cormorant, some of the 11 species of giant tortoise that can live to more than 200 years old, plus fur seals and migratory whales. </p> <p>By teaming up with the Galapagos Conservation Trust and the Charles Darwin Research Centre, you get an insight into the islands' environmental legacy - and each cruise of 10 people raises US$5,000 for the organisations. For half a day, you are hosted by the Charles Darwin Research Centre where the giant-tortoise breeding programme takes place, and you get to meet the researchers in one of the world's greatest areas of natural importance. </p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.discoveryinitiatives.com\">Discovery Initiatives</a> (01285 810621, email: <a href=\"mailto:enquiry@discoveryinitiatives.com\">enquiry@discoveryinitiatives.com</a>). Price: \u00a32,975, departures Sept 23-Oct 6 and March, July 2001. </p> <p><strong>Offshore</strong><br>Out of the blue</p> <p> Whale and dolphin-watching has become big business in recent years, but, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, some tour operators are doing more harm than good, continually chasing after the whales and dolphins and disturbing their feeding patterns and social interaction. </p> <p>As a result, the WDCS has launched its own travel wing, Out of the Blue. Groups are kept small (eight-12) and each is accompanied by a WDCS expert who has a good working knowledge of the area and of the cetaceans being studied. </p> <p>The areas visited include the Peninsula Valdes in Argentina - a calving and mating ground for the endangered southern right whale - and the Johnstone Strait off Vancouver Island in Canada, which is probably the best place in the world to watch orcas (killer whales), with a 300-strong resident population in summer. </p> <p>Each trip includes whale and dolphin-watching from motor launch, yacht or raft, talks by local naturalists and WDCS researchers, and a visit to a WDCS field station to learn about conservation work. You can relax and watch the experts at work or get involved yourself - on the Azores trip, those who want to dive can help collect naturally-shed skin samples from the sea for DNA analysis. </p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.wdcs.org\">WDCS</a> (01225 334511, email: <a href=\"mailto:info@wdcs.org\">info@wdcs.org</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.bluetravel.co.uk\">Bluetravel</a>.

Prices do not include flights or travel. </p> <p> <strong>UK</strong><br> Lundy Island</p> <p> Lundy Island stands 10 miles off the coast of north Devon, where the Atlantic meets the Bristol Channel. Only half a mile wide and three and a half miles long, it is an island that understands the need for good management. Visitors come here particularly for birdwatching and diving. </p> <p>The puffin inspired the island's name ( Lundey is norse for Puffin island) and puffins can still be seen, although now in small numbers. In the summer, the island is famous for auks (razorbills and guillemots), which breed on the cliffs. The eerie call of the manx shearwater can be heard late in the day, and sightings of rare migrant birds are common in spring and autumn. </p> <p>Lundy is also famous for Sika deer, Soay sheep (the UK's original wild sheep), Lundy ponies (now a recognised breed), grey seals, basking sharks and dolphins. Lundy was the first designated underwater marine reserve in the UK and, as the water here is very clear, diving is excellent, although the temperature is only for the sturdy. All dive groups must get permission from the warden, and warden- led snorkelling sessions can be arranged. </p> <p>Owned by the National Trust, but managed by the charity Landmark Trust, its properties have been preserved and renovated and are now let out to tourists. These self-catering properties accommodate 102 people and there is also camping space for 40. Day trippers can also access the island on its supply ship, MS Olenburg, which runs from Bideford or Ilfracombe most days, weather permitting, but as it takes a maximum of 260, the island is never overcrowded. </p> <p>\u2022 Accommodation in various properties, ranging from Castle Cottage (two people), \u00a3195-\u00a3487 a week depending on season; Old Light Trinity (four people), \u00a3288-\u00a3728 a week; Government House (five people), \u00a3344-\u00a3935 a week.

Its wildlife specialist, Mike Ball, organises wildlife tours for all types of clients - from those with a basic interest in nature to specialists in their field. </p> <p>\"If someone wanted an add-on to a holiday in Thailand, for instance, I might send them to Khao Yai National Park about 100 miles from Bangkok, which has elephant, gibbons, tigers and impressive birdlife,\" he says. \"But if people have particular areas of interest, we will check out exactly where is best for them and who to link them up with. For instance, last year we arranged a trip to Borneo for an entomologist who wanted to find a tarantula that hadn't been seen since the 1920s. We set up his trip with a specialist wildlife ground-handler in Malaysia and the entomologist found the spider in two weeks.\" </p> <p>Symbiosis is particularly focused on organising wildlife holidays with close community involvement and using local wildlife specialists. Tiger tracking in a national park in Sumatra is possible, for instance, with a \"Parang Hariman\" or tiger caller on a two-to- three-day forest hike. Symbiosis also has close links with research projects and local conservation organisations. For example, the Crater Mountain Project, a research station in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, monitors rainforest flora, fauna and birdlife, including the New Guinea harpy eagle. One of the rarest eagles in the world, it lives in the rainforest canopy, feeds on large forest animals, and is currently endangered because of habitat loss. </p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.symbiosis-travel.co.uk\">Symbiosis Expeditions</a>.

It's worth researching employers through the hot-links on the fair website at <a href=\"http://www.careers.lon.ac.uk/lgrf.\">www.careers.lon.ac.uk/lgrf</a> Not only can you find out what they actually do, you can often get inside information on the type of people they look for and what it's like to work for them. </p> <p>And if you haven't already sent off for a catalogue, you can buy one when you arrive at the fair. Priced at \u00a31.50 it contains full details of all exhibitors and the vacancies they are offering. It also contains a plan so you can navigate your way around the fair, and the complete seminar programme. Use the catalogue to target specific companies that interest you, but also those which have appropriate vacancies that maybe you hadn't considered before. </p> <p>It's important to make a good first impression, so dress smartly and treat the fair as an interview situation. For example, don't ask PricewaterhouseCoopers \"What do you do?\" - if you've researched the companies beforehand you should know already. Think up some relevant and intelligent questions, and try to pre-empt questions they may ask you. The fair will be very busy and you will have only a short time to make an impact, so make sure it's a good one. </p> <p>Some organisations will be taking CVs, so bring along plenty of copies. If you have time before the fair get one of your college careers advisers to check it over. They will be able to offer ideas and tips on layout, wording and how to sell yourself. </p> <p>If an employer gives you an application form, don't rush to fill it in. Take it home with you and complete it in your own time. If you haven't heard from an employer by about three weeks after the fair, follow it up with a phone call or letter.

Breathe deeply and rejoice in the knowledge that there are more employers wanting to recruit you at the ULCS London Graduate Recruitment Fair than at any fair since 1990. </p> <p>The ULCS London Graduate Recruitment Fair is Europe's most prestigious graduate recruitment event but what will really interest you is that this year a record number of employers representing a broad range of employment sectors will attend and they are keen to harness your talents. For those of you looking for a traditional 'graduate' career, there are financial institutions, government agencies, retail and engineering companies including the Bank of England, the European Commission, Arcadia and Motorola. </p> <p>Meanwhile Rutherford Appleton Laboratories, Wyeth and Epigenomics are all seeking scientists. As always the IT industry is well represented with many new media companies as well as the more traditional system support companies. The fair provides you with the opportunity to meet these people, speak to them about their organisation and impress them with your skills and personality. Some may even want to interview you on the spot. </p> <p>Have you set your heart on a more 'creative' job, where every position has several hundred applicants? We can't promise that any of these recruiters will be hiring at the fair but we can offer some inside information at our Professional Bodies and Information seminars where representatives from television, PR, radio, publishing and advertising (among others) will speak about what they do, how they got there and perhaps give you some ideas on how you can do the same. </p> <p>If you still aren't sure what you want to do, the fair has even more to offer. Speak to the many professional bodies on hand to find out more about working in their industries. A comprehensive seminar program also runs throughout the two days with help on how to begin (and complete!) your job search successfully. </p> <p>Careers advisers from the University of London will also be available to help with short advice sessions and a CV surgery to improve your applications. </p> <p>With more than 12,000 visitors expected at the fair, this can only ever be a brief emergency assistance. So if you feel you need more in-depth advice, hurry along to your university careers service before you leave. </p> <p>If you'd prefer something more impersonal or you want more than one opinion, visit the fair's Cyber Centre and try the computer-aided careers guidance programme which matches your job preferences with careers - it may give you a few ideas to work on. </p> <p>However you feel about your current job prospects, be realistic but also be optimistic. Graduate employment is rising and there are opportunities out there. </p> <p>If you do decide to attend the ULCS London Graduate Recruitment Fair come prepared. Wear a suit, bring copies of your CV and try to find out more about the organisations you are interested in before you make the journey to the fair. </p> <p>No one ever claimed that finding a job would be easy. The ULCS London Graduate Recruitment Fair makes it as easy as it can be - but you have to put in a little bit of hard work in order to reap the highest dividends. </p> <p>\u0095 Anne-Marie Martin is director of the University of London Careers Service.</p>",

We can't promise that any of these recruiters will be hiring at the fair but we can offer some inside information at our Professional Bodies and Information seminars where representatives from television, PR, radio, publishing and advertising (among others) will speak about what they do, how they got there and perhaps give you some ideas on how you can do the same. If you still aren't sure what you want to do, the fair has even more to offer. Speak to the many professional bodies on hand to find out more about working in their industries. A comprehensive seminar program also runs throughout the two days with help on how to begin (and complete!) your job search successfully. Careers advisers from the University of London will also be available to help with short advice sessions and a CV surgery to improve your applications. With more than 12,000 visitors expected at the fair, this can only ever be a brief emergency assistance. So if you feel you need more in-depth advice, hurry along to your university careers service before you leave. If you'd prefer something more impersonal or you want more than one opinion, visit the fair's Cyber Centre and try the computer-aided careers guidance programme which matches your job preferences with careers - it may give you a few ideas to work on. However you feel about your current job prospects, be realistic but also be optimistic. Graduate employment is rising and there are opportunities out there. If you do decide to attend the ULCS London Graduate Recruitment Fair come prepared. Wear a suit, bring copies of your CV and try to find out more about the organisations you are interested in before you make the journey to the fair. No one ever claimed that finding a job would be easy. The ULCS London Graduate Recruitment Fair makes it as easy as it can be - but you have to put in a little bit of hard work in order to reap the highest dividends. \u0095 Anne-Marie Martin is director of the University of London Careers Service.",

Pitch it too high and you look unrealistic and overly confident, pitch it too low and you undervalue both yourself and your ability to do the job. For most of us, salary is one of the most important factors in taking a job - and yet it is often the subject that is hardest to discuss. </p> <p>\"I never know how to tackle the subject of salary,\" admits Ian Brinkworth, who works as design editor on a glossy magazine. \"I always research how much other companies pay and go into an interview armed with the relevant knowledge, but somehow I always come out with a bad deal. I got my last job through an agency and there was \u00a35,000 difference between the top and bottom end of the salary offered. I promised myself I'd ask for a figure at the top end of the range, but when it came to it I found myself asking for only \u00a31,000 more than their lowest figure. Which of course they agreed to, readily.\" </p> <p>\"Research is essential when it comes to proposing a reasonable salary, says Mark Hastings, head of policy at the Institute of Management. \"Look around at job advertisements, websites, newspapers - there is a vast amount of information out there about jobs and relevant salaries. And research the company which is interviewing you - a big company will probably offer a far different salary package to a smaller one.\" </p> <p>The most important thing to remember when discussing your salary is that it is a negotiation. The first figure you mention probably won't be the figure you agree on; but it is a figure from which you will only negotiate down. \"The key is to negotiate from a position of strength,\" says business consultant Richard Owen. \"In other words you have to believe that you are bringing something to the table. Even as a recent graduate you still have individual, unique skills to offer and it's important to bear that in mind. </p> <p>\"My problem is that I never really see it as an equal discussion,\" says Brinkworth. \"I feel like they've got a figure in mind and unless I say the same amount or below then they won't give me the job. It never occurs to me that they might not have a set figure, that they might be flexible according to who they want to give the job to.\" </p> <p>In fact, this is often the case. All employers know that finding the right person for the job isn't easy; if they offer you the position and they really want you for the job, then they will adjust the package accordingly. \"Asking for a slightly higher salary will not affect the interviewer's decision to give you the job,\" says Owen. </p> <p>\"If an employer indicates a salary range, they will pay the top figure if they find the right person for the job. If you're not comfortable asking for the top amount, then go for just above mid-range; it's important to give the impression that you are worth a decent salary.\" </p> <p>It's equally important to be flexible about the figure that is finally offered to you; if the company cannot pay the salary you want, there may be other parts of the package that can bring it up to a more acceptable level. \"When I left university I was offered a dream job as a production assistant in a TV company,\" says Joely Clarke, \"but the money was appalling. I asked for more and they simply said they were offering me the going rate. At first I was going to turn it down, but they offered to send me on all sorts of courses and would ensure I was an assistant producer in a year's time. And they stuck to their word: a year later I was earning \u00a310,000 more and on a fast-track to being a producer. It was a fantastic opportunity - and although I was utterly skint for a year, the money I am earning now and will earn in the future more than makes up for it.\" </p> <p>\"Every job is a mixture of earning, learning and opportunity - salary is only one part of it,\" believes Mark Hastings. \"If the salary is less than you want - and non-negotiable - then suggest other benefits the company might give you: training courses, help with further study, extra holiday or a guarantee of promoting you, and increasing your salary, after a certain period, if your work is of a sufficiently high standard. Some people focus exclusively on salary when there may be other opportunities on offer that are far more valuable than an extra couple of grand.\" </p> <p><strong> If you don't remember anything else... </strong></p> <p>A salary negotiation is a two-way conversation.

In fact, it is now one of the main criteria in determining whether to accept or reject a new job according to the Association of Graduate Recruiters. </p> <p>\"What we have found\", says chief executive officer Carl Gilleard, \"is that graduates really do live to work, not work to live.\" </p> <p>A PricewaterhouseCoopers survey recently reinforced this point. Fifty seven per cent of respondents rated the work-life balance a \"top priority for their future career\". </p> <p>At least, that's what graduates say on questionnaires.

She stresses, however, \"some are taking a more level approach\". </p> <p>Arguably this is because they can. Peninah Thomson of executive coaching specialist The Change Partnership explains further. \"There is a select group of graduates out there now who are so in demand that they are able to ask for what they want.\" And if what they want is a better work-life balance, then that is precisely what they can have. \"In certain sectors of the economy, some graduates can effectively dictate their own terms,\" confirms Fin O'Hara from management consultancy Ceridian. </p> <p>But what if you are not one of the chosen few? \"You will do almost anything just to get the job you want and then you will do anything just to keep it,\" says Kara Wescombe. She graduated from the Winchester School of Art in 1997 and is now the education officer for London's Courtauld Gallery. </p> <p>Before being properly employed to do this job she actually did it on a voluntary, part-time basis, working during her weekends for nothing more than the opportunity to improve her chances of getting an in - and, all the while, holding down a regular full-time position elsewhere. These choices, insists Kara, were made willingly. \"I really wanted to get started in my career\", she says. \"Right now, that does mean putting other things on hold\". </p> <p>Giulio Quaggiotto recognises this equation. He is also choosing to forgo nights out with friends for nights in at the office. With a MA in communication from Westminster University he recently started working as a researcher for Paradigm, a new media company based in London. Here Quaggiotto is \"very much in charge\" of managing his own time. \"It's great,\" he says. \"At least when I've finished I can actually leave. You don't have to hang around to 10 or 11 just for the sake of it, something I've seen happen in other places.\" </p> <p>Peer pressure and economic conditions are not the only factors that determine graduates' work-life balance. There are also the graduates themselves. Some may feel nervous in their position and, according to a new report from Cambridge University, this insecurity can lead to a tendency to work more intensely. Others just push themselves regardless. Dr Desmond Kelly from the Royal College of Psychiatrists argues that some workers \"have a little terrorist in their brain that just flogs them on, day in, day out\". </p> <p>London College of Fashion graduate Dominic Shortle freely confesses to possessing a \"strong\" work ethic.

      "body": "<p>Now is the time for travelling. But what are the risks to graduates who set off for their season in the sun without a clear idea of what they could be doing when they return? </p> <p>\"I made the classic mistake,\" says Luke Dent. \"I knew I was going to do a few ski seasons in Grenoble after I graduated, mixed in with summer camp work in France and America, so I didn't pay too much attention to the opportunities in my final year. This made it much more difficult to find a good job when I came back.\" </p> <p>However much you think you're going to enjoy the worlds of back-packing and seasonal employment abroad - and even if you think you're going to be doing it for the foreseeable future - it's likely that one day you are going to want a job that reflects your education. </p> <p>The first problem is timing. If you are looking for a graduate traineeship, selection is timed to the academic year: applications in by January, interviews and tests in February and March, offers in May-June, start in September. If you arrive back at the wrong time, it could be 18 months before you start work. </p> <p>All of which presumes that you can get a traineeship. As you haven't secured a job before going, employers are going to question your commitment to themselves, the industry, and to a more settled lifestyle - the latter being one of the most important problems, as many employers will worry that you have itchy feet. </p> <p>\"When employers ask you if you have got the wanderlust out of your system, it is vital that you have a convincing answer to this question,\" says Dent. \"And if they don't ask, you should volunteer it. In order to carry conviction you have to be convinced yourself. I learned this the hard way. After I came back I went for a number of interviews in media sales and though they liked me, they reported back that their concern was that I would be off again as soon as the ski season started.\" </p> <p>By the time it came to an interview for the logistics arm of Boots, he had his answer down pat. \"I told them quite truthfully that I had run out of challenges. I could do the ski job in my sleep, I was bored of living in hotels and found the fact that I was only forming friendships that lasted a few months dispiriting. I was ready for home, and for new opportunities.\" </p> <p>Unlike smaller companies that may just make appointments on gut instincts (once a traveller always a traveller), big graduate recruiters like Boots are wary of writing anyone off, and were pleased to offer Dent the job. </p> <p>\"We look at people like Luke because everyone demonstrates their vitality and energy in different ways,\" says Alan Kerr, recruitment marketing manager with Boots. \"For some it is academic work, for others it is extra-curricular activities, while for others it may be the challenge of an alien environment. As to worrying whether people will wander off, our attitude is that the best people do need challenges, so it is up to us as an organisation to convince them that their next year with us will be just as invigorating.\" </p> <p>But big name recruiters of course require far more than to be convinced that you are not about to disappear again. What they are looking for is transferable skills. </p> <p>\"We are looking for specific answers to specific competency questions,\" says Jane Brundle, graduate recruitment manager with KPMG. \"In a way it does not really matter what you have done, whether travelling, a voluntary project, or seasonal employment. It is what you have learned that matters. I would, however be very doubtful of someone who didn't have any work experience these days.\" </p> <p>It is, of course, far easier to demonstrate transferable skills if you have already thought about this aspect and built it into your itinerary. </p> <p>Sophie Matthews spent six months in Chile, three of which were on a Raleigh Expedition where she helped build a community centre and a bridge. \"I would highly recommend this type of activity,\" she says. \"It was superb for a number of reasons. But in terms of employment benefits, there is no doubt that building a bridge across a river is an organisational and logistical challenge which naturally gives you the sort of team-building and leadership skills that employers are looking for. I will definitely keep it on my CV.\" </p> <p>Matthews, however, already had a job with Andersen Consulting on hold when she left for Chile, and her case highlights the great Catch 22 of travelling. It is much easier to focus on what you can get out of an experience if you know what you will be doing at the end of it. But for many, much of the attraction of foreign travel is the fact that its open-ended nature allows them to focus on what it is they want while being well away from family and friends. </p> <p>Luke Dent occasionally attends recruitment fairs on behalf of his company and finds that he is often fielding questions from students who want to plan their get-up-and-going so they don't return to find career prospects have gone AWOL as well. </p> <p>\"I tell them it really is best to use the careers service resources available to them in university,\" he says, \"and to think about what sort of job they want now rather than later. However, if they do head off without a job, it is important to think about the experience they do have in terms of key competencies.\"</p>",

As you haven't secured a job before going, employers are going to question your commitment to themselves, the industry, and to a more settled lifestyle - the latter being one of the most important problems, as many employers will worry that you have itchy feet. \"When employers ask you if you have got the wanderlust out of your system, it is vital that you have a convincing answer to this question,\" says Dent. \"And if they don't ask, you should volunteer it. In order to carry conviction you have to be convinced yourself. I learned this the hard way. After I came back I went for a number of interviews in media sales and though they liked me, they reported back that their concern was that I would be off again as soon as the ski season started.\" By the time it came to an interview for the logistics arm of Boots, he had his answer down pat. \"I told them quite truthfully that I had run out of challenges. I could do the ski job in my sleep, I was bored of living in hotels and found the fact that I was only forming friendships that lasted a few months dispiriting. I was ready for home, and for new opportunities.\" Unlike smaller companies that may just make appointments on gut instincts (once a traveller always a traveller), big graduate recruiters like Boots are wary of writing anyone off, and were pleased to offer Dent the job. \"We look at people like Luke because everyone demonstrates their vitality and energy in different ways,\" says Alan Kerr, recruitment marketing manager with Boots. \"For some it is academic work, for others it is extra-curricular activities, while for others it may be the challenge of an alien environment. As to worrying whether people will wander off, our attitude is that the best people do need challenges, so it is up to us as an organisation to convince them that their next year with us will be just as invigorating.\" But big name recruiters of course require far more than to be convinced that you are not about to disappear again. What they are looking for is transferable skills. \"We are looking for specific answers to specific competency questions,\" says Jane Brundle, graduate recruitment manager with KPMG. \"In a way it does not really matter what you have done, whether travelling, a voluntary project, or seasonal employment. It is what you have learned that matters. I would, however be very doubtful of someone who didn't have any work experience these days.\" It is, of course, far easier to demonstrate transferable skills if you have already thought about this aspect and built it into your itinerary. Sophie Matthews spent six months in Chile, three of which were on a Raleigh Expedition where she helped build a community centre and a bridge. \"I would highly recommend this type of activity,\" she says. \"It was superb for a number of reasons. But in terms of employment benefits, there is no doubt that building a bridge across a river is an organisational and logistical challenge which naturally gives you the sort of team-building and leadership skills that employers are looking for. I will definitely keep it on my CV.\" Matthews, however, already had a job with Andersen Consulting on hold when she left for Chile, and her case highlights the great Catch 22 of travelling. It is much easier to focus on what you can get out of an experience if you know what you will be doing at the end of it. But for many, much of the attraction of foreign travel is the fact that its open-ended nature allows them to focus on what it is they want while being well away from family and friends. Luke Dent occasionally attends recruitment fairs on behalf of his company and finds that he is often fielding questions from students who want to plan their get-up-and-going so they don't return to find career prospects have gone AWOL as well. \"I tell them it really is best to use the careers service resources available to them in university,\" he says, \"and to think about what sort of job they want now rather than later. However, if they do head off without a job, it is important to think about the experience they do have in terms of key competencies.\"",

      "bodyText": "The 58 Chinese people who died in a sealed lorry trailer at Dover docks frantically banged on its inside walls with their shoes in a fruitless attempt to get help when they realised their air supply had been cut off, an inquest heard yesterday. The coroner's officer, Graham Perrin, told the inquest in Dover that a vent at the side of the trailer had been closed before the lorry was loaded on to a ferry at Zeebrugge on Sunday. This shut off the air supply to the 56 young men and four women inside. Five hours after the vent was closed, all but two of the group were dead. Mr Perrin said the two survivors, both men, had lived only because more oxygen became available for them to breathe as those around them died. Both were unconscious when they were found. The inquest heard that boxes of tomatoes had been stacked at the back of the container to hide the people on board and make it look as though the trailer was full. The lorry had left the Belgian port at 7.30pm local time, aboard the P&amp;O vessel European Pathway. It arrived four and a half hours later at 11pm. \"It would appear that 90 minutes into the journey and realising the situation they were in, attempts were made by the occupants of the trailer to raise the alarm. This happened as they slowly became short of breath, hot and sweaty,\" Mr Perrin said. \"They tried to open the vent from within and moved the tomatoes to attempt to open the door. All the deceased had consumed some tomatoes, probably to keep their spirits going,\" Mr Perrin said. The migrants had not been allowed to take bags with them and some wore as many as five layers of clothing. They all started to remove some of their clothes. \"They were banging on the walls of the container in an attempt to be heard. This proved fruitless. Without air to breathe they were now inhaling their own respiratory waste, namely carbon dioxide,\" said Mr Perrin. He said that death would have been fairly rapid once the carbon dioxide built up to critical levels. There was no evidence of dehydration or excessive heat despite exceptionally hot weather on the day. Details of the deaths of the migrants, whose bodies have been simply numbered one to 58 in the absence of proper identification, were heard after the Dutch lorry driver, Perry Wacker, aged 32, made his first appearance before Folkestone magistrates, where he was charged with 58 counts of manslaughter, facilitating the entry of two people illegally into the country on June 18 and attempting to facilitate the entry of a further 58 people on the same date. He was remanded in custody for seven days. Magistrates made an order banning the publication of pictures of him as identification is an issue in the case. Possible identities for three of the dead were given to the Home Office yesterday by a solicitor, Wah-Piow Tan, but he warned officials there would be little progress towards identifying the rest without an amnesty for British-based relatives who feared deportation. The solicitor is in contact with seven families who believe their relatives may be among the victims. He wants the Home Office to give those who come forward permission to stay in Britain on compassionate grounds if they identify the bodies. \"We do not want to see a situation where 58 corpses lie in a mortuary because nothing can be done to identify them,\" he said. Last night the Home Office said talks would take place to try to resolve the issue. Kent police said last night that fingerprints had revealed the group in the lorry were not the same people as those filmed by a Belgian TV crew two months ago. Dover deaths: two charged A Chinese woman and man have been charged with conspiracy to smuggle illegal immigrants into Britain after 58 bodies were found in a lorry at Dover, Kent police said last night. Interpreter Ying Guo, 29, and chef You Yi, 38, from South Woodford, Essex, are to appear at Dover magistrates court today.",

Mark Forrester, of Birmingham, who denied that he caused any serious trouble, was led away in handcuffs after the Belgian judge read out the verdict. His lawyers said he would appeal against the sentence in two weeks time. Forrester, 33, and married with a two-year-old child, is the first England fan to be given a custodial sentence in Belgium. He is one of some 900 England fans to have been detained by the Belgian authorities during Euro 2000. Most of the hooligans have since been released, however, and apart from Forrester, only one other England fan is being held on remand in Belgium. Forrester, a company manager, was one of 450 rampaging England supporters arrested by the police after a chaotic night of pitched battles in Brussels before the England v Germany match. The trouble became so serious at one point that police used tear gas and baton charged fans who were brawling with local youths, German fans and the police. Judge Regine Claeys told Forrester that there was \"very clear and detailed evidence\" that he had instigated riots in Brussels on the night of June 16. Police witnesses had previously described how he had kicked and punched their colleagues and encouraged other fans to attack the massed ranks of heavily armed riot police. He was also spotted making offensive gestures and moving round behind police lines when the serious trouble kicked off. The court was told that he was eventually arrested by a plain clothes police officer whose job it was to spot hardcore hooligans. \"You were very provocative and very aggressive.

There are screenplays, children's books, plays, teaching and one-off cartoons for the New York Times, the New Yorker and Rolling Stone. \"The Reagan years gave me lots of material, like the Nixon years did,\" he said. \"Clinton and his weirdness gave me material but he really wasn't fun because I started out liking him.\" One cartoon suggested that President Clinton should not have been impeached for his behaviour but \"grounded\" like an adolescent.",

      "bodyText": "William Hague faces a Commons inquiry into allegations that the Tories are misusing \u00a33.4m of taxpayers' money as the party suffers a funding crisis. The public administration select committee is to consider a proposal on Tuesday to investigate claims that the Tories are spending much of their \u00a33.4m \"Short money\", intended for parliamentary purposes, to finance the party's election campaign. Lord Ashcroft, the Tories' treasurer, could be grilled in public for the first time if the committee agrees to widen an investigation into the role and funding of government special advisers to cover state aid for political parties. Tory accounts published in March last year disclosed a \u00a313.5m debt with income down to just \u00a38m, leaving the party dependent on Lord Ashcroft, who has given more than \u00a33m, and the taxpayers' support. Conservative MPs and House of Commons authorities are seeking to block the inquiry, but the committee, chaired by Labour MP Tony Wright, has a Labour majority. \"Short money\", introduced 25 years ago by then Labour leader of the Commons, Edward Short, is to allow opposition parties to scrutinise the government. The Liberal Democrats also receive support. The cash is supposed to be spent on researchers for shadow ministers, opposition whips' office and the leader of the opposition's staff to cover \"parliamentary business relating to procedures at the House\". But Michael Ancram, the Tory party chairman, has conceded that a significant proportion is spent on Conservative central office's \"war room\" to fight the election. Staff in the war room, modelled on Labour's Millbank operation, have doubled from 30 to 60 though Mr Ancram insists the expenditure is allowed within the rules. The Commons fees office, however, is reviewing the regulations and Tory auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers contacted Commons authorities some half-a-dozen times to check details before signing off the Conservative accounts. Labour MP Fraser Kemp, who has been seeking an inquiry, said: \"Taxpayers' money should not be used to fund the Conservatives' general election campaign. The rules are quite clear on what it can be spent on, and those rules are being flouted by the Tories.\" Details of the row emerged after the Guardian revealed last week that Labour is struggling to raise cash for its election campaign. Donations from companies to the Conservatives are at a post-war low and in the year ending March 1999 totalled \u00a3605,315 - a 76% drop on the previous year. A trawl of the accounts of 3,000 public and private companies by the union-funded Labour research department found only 38 cash gifts, compared with 100 during the previous 12 months. Weetabix gave \u00a325,000 against \u00a3274,000 the year before, while Haymarket, the publishing group chaired by Michael Heseltine, cut its donation from \u00a350,000 to \u00a31,000. Yorkshire eurosceptic Paul Sykes has promised to back the Tories, but Mr Hague fears the money will have unacceptable strings attached. A Tory spokesman said: \"We spend the money perfectly properly and in accordance to the rules. \"If they have an inquiry, that is exactly what they will discover.\"",

      "bodyText": "William Hague is poised to outflank Labour on democratic reform by embracing a largely elected second chamber and sweeping changes designed to make the executive - and specifically the prime minister - fully accountable to parliament. The Tory leader is preparing in the next fortnight to publish a 25,000-word report prepared for him by a commission headed by the distinguished political scientist Lord Norton. The report, \"Strengthening Parliament\", is intended to make the Commons - currently often deserted - the focal point of British political life again. The Norton commission will recommend: \u0095 stronger select committees free of the control of party whips; \u0095 new powers for the Lords to block the fast-growing use of subsidiary legislation; \u0095 a requirement that the prime minister regularly open set-piece debates; \u0095 television cameras to be given more freedom to film inside parliament and interview MPs inside the Palace of Westminster; \u0095 the prime minister to be required to appear in front of select committees; \u0095 prime minister's questions, which were made weekly by Tony Blair, to revert to a twice-weekly event; \u0095 MPs to be given powers to scrutinise and even block items of departmental spending. The commission may also propose reform of the finance bill, which implements the Budget, so that scrutiny of technical and political issues is divided. More draft government bills would be subject to full scrutiny by experts cross-examined by MPs. The commission is also expected to recommend that select committees be given more resources so they are more closely modelled on US congressional committees. Committee reports would also be regularly debated in the Commons, forcing the government to give a full response to criticisms expressed by all-party bodies. Party whips would be banned from controlling membership of committees, giving MPs an alternative to seeking a career as a minister. Rules to ensure that ministers only made substantial announcements to the Commons, rather than on television or radio, would also be tightened. In a separate move, the Conservatives are now expected to support a second chamber in which half the members are elected. Sir George Young, shadow leader of the Commons, said this week that the Tories would support a higher percentage of elected members than the 30% maximum proposed by the Wakeham commission. Conservative MPs expect Mr Hague to increase the figure to 50%. Labour, fearing undue conflict between the Commons and a democratic upper house, appears to favour only 100 elected members. Although there will be some cynicism about Mr Hague's plans in view of Lady Thatcher and John Major's treatment of parliament, the Tory leader believes the Commons' scrutiny role can be improved. Labour sources said it was easy for political parties to promise in opposition to make life difficult for themselves if elected, but then not to act on their promises.

She had sought take-off clearance from the Hanoi control tower but was told it had been denied as the Chinese would not allow her to fly into their airspace.</p> <p>China has a venerable tradition of frustrating attempts to circumnavigate the globe.

After the Branson attempt failed, the Chinese foreign ministry announced it was suspending permission for three other round-the-world balloon teams until further \"notification\".</p> <p>Yesterday the Chinese foreign ministry was said to be working with the British embassy in Beijing to obtain the release of Mr Bodill.</p> <p>The Chinese government last night said two aircraft had been escorting the microlight through the country's airspace, as a courtesy. When the microlight got into difficulty, the aircraft launched flares to help him land at an airfield, but the storm forced him down.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A British microlight pilot who braved a broken exhaust over Jordan, red tape in India, and monsoons in Bangladesh, yesterday encountered the most persuasive argument to stop his attempt to fly around the world - a squad of jet fighters over China. Blown 100 miles off the authorised track by a storm, world microlight champion Colin Bodill found himself over a military area and surrounded by fighters, who forced him to land by firing flares. Fellow British pilot Jennifer Murray, who is attempting to fly a helicopter solo around the world, spoke to Mr Bodill by mobile phone as he was surrounded by a crowd of curious peasants in a paddy field 10 miles from Nanning. She said: \"It seems he strayed over a military area. He said he suddenly had fighters all around him and they fired flares to force him down. \"When we spoke to him, there were fighters circling in the air and he was surrounded by hundreds of peasants.\" Mrs Murray said he was being detained, but he and the plane were unharmed, though she added: \"It's caused a bit of a diplomatic incident.\" Mr Bodill, 49, a microlight instructor from Nottingham, was on his way from Hanoi to Hong Kong and had taken off two hours before Mrs Murray. She had sought take-off clearance from the Hanoi control tower but was told it had been denied as the Chinese would not allow her to fly into their airspace. China has a venerable tradition of frustrating attempts to circumnavigate the globe. In December 1998, Chinese air traffic authorities initially refused permission to Richard Branson's round-the-world balloon trip to alter its route across Chinese airspace. Permission was given just in time for the flight to continue, but only after extra fuel had been used. After the Branson attempt failed, the Chinese foreign ministry announced it was suspending permission for three other round-the-world balloon teams until further \"notification\". Yesterday the Chinese foreign ministry was said to be working with the British embassy in Beijing to obtain the release of Mr Bodill. The Chinese government last night said two aircraft had been escorting the microlight through the country's airspace, as a courtesy. When the microlight got into difficulty, the aircraft launched flares to help him land at an airfield, but the storm forced him down.",

      "body": "<p>South Korea prepares to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Korean war tomorrow in subdued tones which would have been inconceivable before the success of last week's North-South summit.</p> <p>Those taking part in the slimmed-down ceremony will sing songs \"that aspire to peace and unification\", says the Seoul government, rather than the martial Song of the Korean War.</p> <p>President Kim Dae-jung, fresh from his triumph in Pyongyang, met a group of bemused veterans from the foreign contingents who fought under the UN flag from 1950 to 1953. He thanked them for their contribution to the defence of freedom and democracy and then praised the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, for his \"difficult decision\" to hold the summit.</p> <p>Kim Jong-il is the son of the Northern communist leader Kim Il-sung who precipitated the three-year war when his troops crossed the 38th parallel on June 25 1950.</p> <p>Decades of confrontation along this line seemed forgotten as the South Korean ministry of defence announced that the North Korean army would no longer be referred to as \"communist puppets\".</p> <p>South Korea also announced agreement with the North to set up a military hotline to avoid accidental clashes, raising the hope that there could ultimately be a reduction in the huge forces - a million in total - ranged along the 155-mile border.</p> <p>There has been lively speculation that the two Kims already have a personal hotline. This was sparked by a report that they had discussed the names given to the prize dogs which they presented to each other.</p> <p>The Korean war, at a conservative estimate, led to the deaths of 1m Chinese and North Korean soldiers, 400,000 soldiers on the South Korean and UN side, and 2m civilians North and South.

      "bodyText": "South Korea prepares to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Korean war tomorrow in subdued tones which would have been inconceivable before the success of last week's North-South summit. Those taking part in the slimmed-down ceremony will sing songs \"that aspire to peace and unification\", says the Seoul government, rather than the martial Song of the Korean War. President Kim Dae-jung, fresh from his triumph in Pyongyang, met a group of bemused veterans from the foreign contingents who fought under the UN flag from 1950 to 1953. He thanked them for their contribution to the defence of freedom and democracy and then praised the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, for his \"difficult decision\" to hold the summit. Kim Jong-il is the son of the Northern communist leader Kim Il-sung who precipitated the three-year war when his troops crossed the 38th parallel on June 25 1950. Decades of confrontation along this line seemed forgotten as the South Korean ministry of defence announced that the North Korean army would no longer be referred to as \"communist puppets\". South Korea also announced agreement with the North to set up a military hotline to avoid accidental clashes, raising the hope that there could ultimately be a reduction in the huge forces - a million in total - ranged along the 155-mile border. There has been lively speculation that the two Kims already have a personal hotline. This was sparked by a report that they had discussed the names given to the prize dogs which they presented to each other. The Korean war, at a conservative estimate, led to the deaths of 1m Chinese and North Korean soldiers, 400,000 soldiers on the South Korean and UN side, and 2m civilians North and South. Yet in this week's post-summit euphoria it has almost become the war which no one wants to mention. A spokesman for the South Korean president said that they had considered cancelling tomorrow's ceremony but decided not to because of the foreign veterans who had already been invited. The big event in Seoul is Luciano Pavarotti's appearance on June 30 in a special concert to mark the summit, called \"Peace forever, unite as one\". The US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, who arrived in South Korea on a hastily arranged visit yesterday, has also had to accustom herself to the new view of the North Korean leader. She told journalists in Beijing that Kim Jong-il appeared to have been \"jovial and forthcoming and knowledgeable and different than we had all been led to believe\". The abrupt change of mood has bewildered some older South Koreans, who still see the North as a threat. A report in the Korea Herald said: \"A growing number of young people are insisting that the people of North Korea are not the enemy, but brethren with whom the South should join hands.\" A new sense of impatience with the American forces in South Korea - until now seen by the majority in their historical role as liberators - has spread among the young. \"They should not behave like a conquering army,\" a Korean journalist said during the summit. \"They are the guests and we are the host.\" Protests against a US bombing range on an island near the west coast village of Maehyang-ri have increased. Thousands of demonstrators tried to occupy the island before the US resumed bombing and shooting exercises on Monday. Meanwhile, North Korea has switched off its cross-border loudspeakers and refrained from anti-South propaganda since the summit was held. During the summit, Kim Jong-il is said to have turned to a senior North defence official, Jo Myong-rok and instructed him to make sure that there was \"no military conflict whatsoever\". By contrast to last year's naval clashes over fishing rights, the North allowed a Southern fishing boat which strayed into its waters last week to return home.

      "bodyText": "The loyalist terror group the Ulster Freedom Fighters yesterday suspended its threat to end its ceasefire and shoot anyone attacking Protestant homes. In an announcement, the UFF said that while \"we state clearly that attacks on Protestant homes cannot be tolerated, we affirm our desire to have this problem resolved peacefully.\" Tuesday's surprise statement threatening the ceasefire is thought to have been more of an attempt by the UFF to assert authority in the Protestant areas they control than a genuine attack on the peace process. Its withdrawal came after appeals from politicians and the organisation's political wing, the Ulster Democratic Party to suspend the threat. In the past few months the UFF in some areas of Belfast had changed tack and had even provided \"security\" to prevent clashes between loyalists and nationalists during marches. But for months there has been tension between loyalist paramilitary groups as each seeks to exert control in certain areas of the city. Tuesday's threat was seen as a flexing of muscles by the UFF. Yesterday's statement also said: \"The onus is on community leaders to engage seriously to find a resolution to the issue.\" John White, chairman of the Ulster Democratic Party, said: \"This is a very positive statement and it gives us an opportunity to resolve this issue peacefully.\" Throughout the 30 years of the troubles in Northern Ireland there has been sectarian intimidation on both sides. However, the Northern Ireland housing executive said that all of the 21 complaints of sectarian intimidation in the last months had come from Catholics. Sinn Fein assemblyman Gerry Kelly claimed that the suspension of the UFF's threat to break the ceasefire proved that \"it should never have been made.\" Mr Kelly said that \"despite this apparent public withdrawal of the threat to kill Catholics, I would urge everyone to remain vigilant.\" He pointed out that the UFF has suspended, not withdrawn, the threat. Over the past week the build-up to the traditional Orange marching season has heightened tensions between the two communities. There is major concern about this weekend's Orange march through the mainly Catholic Springfield Road in west Belfast. Sinn Fein has called on the Parades Commission to ban the march.",

Embassy officials from Spain, Holland, Korea, New Zealand, Israel and Canada were last night waiting to hear if their citizens were among those killed.</p> <p>The dangerous state of the burnt-out hostel, built in 1906 to replace a pub burnt down in a blaze that destroyed much of Childers, meant the bodies lying mainly on the second storey could not be recovered or even counted. Miraculously, 69 people survived, including an estimated 20 Britons.</p> <p>\"I heard a tremendous sound of cracking glass - it sounded like somebody was trying to break into the place - and I screamed at the four other girls in my dorm,\" Emma, a Briton, told Australian radio. \"One of the girls woke up and screamed fire, another tried to open the door but her hand got burnt. We ran out on to the veranda... [and] escaped on to the roof of the shop next door. The other people that were getting out were starting to scream.\"</p> <p>From around the world backpackers stop in Childers on the Queensland coast to earn money picking vegetables. The work helps to fund their trips around Australia in search of adventure and self-discovery. When the fire broke out, at 12.30am yesterday, 84 mainly young people were asleep in the hostel. They were to rise at six to be bussed to fields full of tomatoes, courgettes and snow peas.</p> <p><b> Revenge threat</b><br></p> <p>Police, forensic experts and arson investigators are now waiting to enter the shell of the hostel to start investigating the fire's cause, amid intense local speculation that it was started by a former resident. Some survivors said a man thrown out of the hostel a week ago had threatened to take revenge.</p> <p>Police said they were treating the fire as \"suspicious\", but could not comment on whether they were hunting for a suspect.</p> <p>One survivor, Keith O'Brien, from Wigan, had been in Childers for a month and had just celebrated his 22nd birthday. He said his escape from the burning building had been hampered by bars on some windows which he squeezed through, after kicking down a door and taking a British woman to safety.</p> <p>\"All you could hear was the fire and things crackling; the floorboards, walls, paint - it was just crazy,\" he said. \"I dragged a Welsh girl out of bed, picked her up and walked out. You couldn't see your hand in front of your face.</p> <p>\"I went to the window which had bars on it, horizontal and vertical, pretty much we were trapped. But there was a gap about a foot and a half by a foot. I picked her up, put her through the window. I tried to squeeze through the window and the boys [firefighters) pulled me through.\"</p> <p>Across Britain, anxious parents waited yesterday for phone calls telling them their children were safe. The growth in the number of young people undertaking long-haul trips has been marked, and last year more than one in four of the backpackers visiting Australia was a Briton.</p> <p>Kelly Symonds, 23, who called her mother Dianne in Aberfan, south Wales, had been staying at the hostel with two friends with whom she was taking a round-the-world trip. She told her mother she feared her friends were dead.</p> <p>Another survivor, who declined to be named, told how he had stumbled through a smoke-filled corridor with his arms out to feel his way. He was greeted by the arms of other terrified residents as they reached out in search of safety.</p> <p>\"There were people banging on doors who couldn't get out and smashing doors,\" said one Dutch woman.</p> <p>Louise Brewster, 19, from Hertfordshire, said she feared that at least two of her friends had died in the blaze. \"I worked with them both yesterday, so it's such a shock,\" said Ms Brewster, who was camping near the hostel. \"We were all supposed to go on to the Great Barrier Reef from here, but I don't think any of us will bother now.\"</p> <p>Joey Woods lives 50ft from the hostel. She was the first to ring the fire brigade after being woken up by the shattering glass. \"I thought someone was breaking into a shop and smashing it up,\" she said.</p> <p>\"I saw a glow from the hostel from one window. Within 90 seconds it was all going up. People were climbing down fire exits and the veranda. I could hear people inside calling out for help and a lot of banging on walls and banging as if they were trying to break down doors.\"</p> <p>Her husband Martin had known the Australian backpacker alleged to have threatened the hostel after a row with its management. \"He told two women to tell to other people at the hostel to sleep next to open windows and the fire escape,\" Mr Woods said.</p> <p>Jock Gardner, who ran the Palace until 15 months ago, also strongly suspects arson. He said the wiring had been renewed in 1993 and that the kitchen, the most obvious starting point for an accidental fire, would have been locked at 9pm.</p> <p>Last year he sold his lease to two young Australians, John Dobe and Christian Atkinson, both former geologists who had fancied a change of lifestyle and were last night said to be shocked by the disaster.</p> <p>The hostel was subjected to tough fire safety checks, experts say. Jeff Wright, the fire commissioner, said the building had been equipped with smoke detectors.</p> <p>Those who survived the blaze were offered clothing and food by townspeople. The stench of burning hung over Childers as trauma counsellors were drafted in.</p> <p>The community of 3,000 last night held a barbecue for backpackers, farm workers and residents. At a memorial service at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic church, many linked arms as they sang the hymn Bind us Together. Local authorities were housing the survivors at two motels away from the large media contingent, giving them access to internet facilities to contact relatives.</p> <p>The town's mayor, Bill Trevor, said the travellers had been a welcome part of the community, replacing the local young generation who had left town in search of jobs and to study. \"It's traumatic,\" he said. \"The survivors, and there's 69 been identified, are looking around to see which of their mates are unaccounted for.\"</p> <p>\u0095A quarter of the backpackers who visited Australia last year were from the UK, the country's tourist commission said yesterday</p> <p>\u0095Last year 102,700 young travellers from Britain visited out of more than 404,000 in total, it said.

Miraculously, 69 people survived, including an estimated 20 Britons. \"I heard a tremendous sound of cracking glass - it sounded like somebody was trying to break into the place - and I screamed at the four other girls in my dorm,\" Emma, a Briton, told Australian radio. \"One of the girls woke up and screamed fire, another tried to open the door but her hand got burnt. We ran out on to the veranda... [and] escaped on to the roof of the shop next door. The other people that were getting out were starting to scream.\" From around the world backpackers stop in Childers on the Queensland coast to earn money picking vegetables. The work helps to fund their trips around Australia in search of adventure and self-discovery. When the fire broke out, at 12.30am yesterday, 84 mainly young people were asleep in the hostel. They were to rise at six to be bussed to fields full of tomatoes, courgettes and snow peas. Revenge threat Police, forensic experts and arson investigators are now waiting to enter the shell of the hostel to start investigating the fire's cause, amid intense local speculation that it was started by a former resident. Some survivors said a man thrown out of the hostel a week ago had threatened to take revenge. Police said they were treating the fire as \"suspicious\", but could not comment on whether they were hunting for a suspect. One survivor, Keith O'Brien, from Wigan, had been in Childers for a month and had just celebrated his 22nd birthday. He said his escape from the burning building had been hampered by bars on some windows which he squeezed through, after kicking down a door and taking a British woman to safety. \"All you could hear was the fire and things crackling; the floorboards, walls, paint - it was just crazy,\" he said. \"I dragged a Welsh girl out of bed, picked her up and walked out. You couldn't see your hand in front of your face. \"I went to the window which had bars on it, horizontal and vertical, pretty much we were trapped. But there was a gap about a foot and a half by a foot. I picked her up, put her through the window. I tried to squeeze through the window and the boys [firefighters) pulled me through.\" Across Britain, anxious parents waited yesterday for phone calls telling them their children were safe. The growth in the number of young people undertaking long-haul trips has been marked, and last year more than one in four of the backpackers visiting Australia was a Briton. Kelly Symonds, 23, who called her mother Dianne in Aberfan, south Wales, had been staying at the hostel with two friends with whom she was taking a round-the-world trip. She told her mother she feared her friends were dead. Another survivor, who declined to be named, told how he had stumbled through a smoke-filled corridor with his arms out to feel his way. He was greeted by the arms of other terrified residents as they reached out in search of safety. \"There were people banging on doors who couldn't get out and smashing doors,\" said one Dutch woman. Louise Brewster, 19, from Hertfordshire, said she feared that at least two of her friends had died in the blaze. \"I worked with them both yesterday, so it's such a shock,\" said Ms Brewster, who was camping near the hostel. \"We were all supposed to go on to the Great Barrier Reef from here, but I don't think any of us will bother now.\" Joey Woods lives 50ft from the hostel. She was the first to ring the fire brigade after being woken up by the shattering glass. \"I thought someone was breaking into a shop and smashing it up,\" she said. \"I saw a glow from the hostel from one window. Within 90 seconds it was all going up. People were climbing down fire exits and the veranda. I could hear people inside calling out for help and a lot of banging on walls and banging as if they were trying to break down doors.\" Her husband Martin had known the Australian backpacker alleged to have threatened the hostel after a row with its management. \"He told two women to tell to other people at the hostel to sleep next to open windows and the fire escape,\" Mr Woods said. Jock Gardner, who ran the Palace until 15 months ago, also strongly suspects arson. He said the wiring had been renewed in 1993 and that the kitchen, the most obvious starting point for an accidental fire, would have been locked at 9pm. Last year he sold his lease to two young Australians, John Dobe and Christian Atkinson, both former geologists who had fancied a change of lifestyle and were last night said to be shocked by the disaster. The hostel was subjected to tough fire safety checks, experts say. Jeff Wright, the fire commissioner, said the building had been equipped with smoke detectors. Those who survived the blaze were offered clothing and food by townspeople. The stench of burning hung over Childers as trauma counsellors were drafted in. The community of 3,000 last night held a barbecue for backpackers, farm workers and residents. At a memorial service at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic church, many linked arms as they sang the hymn Bind us Together. Local authorities were housing the survivors at two motels away from the large media contingent, giving them access to internet facilities to contact relatives. The town's mayor, Bill Trevor, said the travellers had been a welcome part of the community, replacing the local young generation who had left town in search of jobs and to study. \"It's traumatic,\" he said. \"The survivors, and there's 69 been identified, are looking around to see which of their mates are unaccounted for.\" \u0095A quarter of the backpackers who visited Australia last year were from the UK, the country's tourist commission said yesterday \u0095Last year 102,700 young travellers from Britain visited out of more than 404,000 in total, it said. This was more than from any other country \u0095The British backpackers stay for an average of 73 nights and spend \u00a3177.3m, compared with the 32,800 Germans who visit for 43 nights and spend \u00a345.9m \u0095The number of working holiday visas granted by Australia has increased from around 35,000 in 1994-95 to almost 65,000 in 1998-99. More than 34,000 of the visas granted in 1998-99 were to people from the UK. In 1999-2000 around 78,000 are expected to be granted \u009579% of backpackers visit Sydney, 48% Melbourne and 42% Brisbane. Half go to north Queensland and 38% to the Northern Territory",

A rebel spokesman and an official involved in the negotiations said the two sides had agreed to the terms under which Fiji's next government would be formed - the final hurdle to the release of the hostages. Joe Brown, a government official involved in the negotiations, said the military commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, and the rebel leader, George Speight, would sign an accord today which would finally end the 36-day hostage crisis. The rebels' spokesman, Jo Nata, confirmed that an agreement had been reached. Mr Speight, the businessman who led an armed raid on parliament on May 19 and took the prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry, and his government hostage, held talks with the military authorities for the sixth day running yesterday. The military assumed executive power and imposed martial law 10 days after Mr Speight and his gang stormed parliament. This week's talks were aimed at sorting out details of an interim civilian government which will presumably lead Fiji to new elections within two years. Both sides said the sticking points were the make-up of the government and the scope of the amnesty to be given to Mr Speight and his men. It was not immediately clear when the hostages will be released, but it is expected to be soon after the accord is signed. Neither Mr Brown nor Mr Nata gave any details of the agreement. Mr Speight's main demands - that the 1997 multi-racial constitution should be thrown out and Mr Chaudhry, Fiji's first prime minister of Indian descent, fired - had already been met. The stand-off has set Fiji's poor indigenous majority against its relatively affluent Indian minority, and spurred accusations in the international community that the once-idyllic island state had descended into racist strife and intolerance. Because of the country's break with democracy, Australia, New Zealand and the US have threatened economic sanctions. And the refusal of Australian trade unions to handle cargo to and from Fiji has paralysed much of the country's exports. The New Zealand foreign minister, Phil Goff, said that his country and Australia, or the EU alone, could cripple Fiji's economy with the stroke of a pen by imposing sanctions. The EU spends about \u00a340m a year on Fijian sugar, paying up to three times the world market price under a preferential trade agreement. \"No country in their right mind would invest in another country that looks like a banana republic, and that's exactly what Fiji looks like,\" Mr Goff said. Meanwhile many of the Indo-Fijians, who make up about 44% of the population of 812,000, say they want to leave because of Mr Speight's coup, which was accompanied by widespread attacks on them. \"We Indians are not secure in Fiji,\" Shakeel Tobrez, 17, said outside a mosque during sabbath prayers yesterday. \"It's cancerous, this ethnic violence, this ethnic cleansing,\" said Mohamed Rafiq, 60, a businessman. He called on Australia to open its doors to Indo-Fijians seeking refuge. Mr Speight has repeatedly said that he staged the coup in the name of the indigenous majority, whose rights, he said, were trampled upon by Mr Chaudhry. During his one-year tenure, Mr Chaudhry came under fire for his arrogant style and for allegedly favouring Indian sugar-cane farmers over the indigenous Fijians who own the land on which the crop is grown. Mr Speight allowed journalists from the Fiji Times to see the hostages from a distance on Thursday. The paper described Mr Chaudhry as looking \"haggard and dejected\". AP",

Yesterday's Los Angeles Times gave Mr Bush a 10-point lead over his rival, a slight increase on last month.</p> <p>An investigation into whether Mr Gore broke electoral rules while fundraising for the 1996 election would be a heavy burden to carry into the last few months of the presidential campaign. It would lend substantial weight to Mr Bush's strategy of portraying his opponent as fatally tainted by the scandals which have enveloped the Clinton White House.</p> <p>The decision about whether to appoint an independent investigator, a \"special counsel\", is now on the desk of the attorney-general, Janet Reno. She has overruled two previous recommendations for an investigation of Mr Gore.</p> <p>At a press conference yesterday, Ms Reno, who was reported to be furious at the leak of news about a potential fresh inquiry, insisted that she would not be rushed into making a decision.</p> <p>The recommendation to appoint a special counsel came from Robert Conrad, the head of a justice department task force which has been looking into the 1996 fundraising.</p> <p>Mr Gore had long been under scrutiny for a visit he made to a Buddhist monastery where campaign contributions were solicited in contravention of federal rules banning fundraising at religious sites. Mr Gore has claimed he did not know the event was a fundraiser.</p> <p>He had also been investigated for 45 fundraising telephone calls made from his office, and for about 100 coffee meetings at the White House arranged for top campaign contributors. A 19th century civil service law prevents the use of government offices to raise federally-regulated campaign funds.</p> <p>According to reports yesterday, Mr Conrad's decision was influenced by interviews with Mr Gore, including a four-hour interrogation at the vice-presidential residence on April 18.</p> <p>The interview appears to have provoked angry reactions from Mr Gore. \"It was sure as hell a different approach.

      "bodyText": "Al Gore's bid to win the presidency was in dire trouble yesterday after confirmation that a senior US justice department official had recommended an independent inquiry into whether he misled investigators over his campaign fundraising efforts in 1996. Even before news of a possible new investigation leaked, the vice-president had been struggling to reinvigorate his campaign against the Republican contender, George W Bush. Yesterday's Los Angeles Times gave Mr Bush a 10-point lead over his rival, a slight increase on last month. An investigation into whether Mr Gore broke electoral rules while fundraising for the 1996 election would be a heavy burden to carry into the last few months of the presidential campaign. It would lend substantial weight to Mr Bush's strategy of portraying his opponent as fatally tainted by the scandals which have enveloped the Clinton White House. The decision about whether to appoint an independent investigator, a \"special counsel\", is now on the desk of the attorney-general, Janet Reno. She has overruled two previous recommendations for an investigation of Mr Gore. At a press conference yesterday, Ms Reno, who was reported to be furious at the leak of news about a potential fresh inquiry, insisted that she would not be rushed into making a decision. The recommendation to appoint a special counsel came from Robert Conrad, the head of a justice department task force which has been looking into the 1996 fundraising. Mr Gore had long been under scrutiny for a visit he made to a Buddhist monastery where campaign contributions were solicited in contravention of federal rules banning fundraising at religious sites. Mr Gore has claimed he did not know the event was a fundraiser. He had also been investigated for 45 fundraising telephone calls made from his office, and for about 100 coffee meetings at the White House arranged for top campaign contributors. A 19th century civil service law prevents the use of government offices to raise federally-regulated campaign funds. According to reports yesterday, Mr Conrad's decision was influenced by interviews with Mr Gore, including a four-hour interrogation at the vice-presidential residence on April 18. The interview appears to have provoked angry reactions from Mr Gore. \"It was sure as hell a different approach. It was real confrontational and put him on the spot,\" said one unnamed official quoted in the New York Times. Justice department investigators are reportedly dissatisfied with Mr Gore's claims that he was unaware of the distinctions between the sort of fundraising that was permissible from White House telephones. He had claimed in a 1998 interview with FBI agents that he drank a lot of iced tea at staff meetings and might therefore have gone to the toilet when the matter was discussed. One source quoted in the New York Times said that investigators were \"punching holes in the iced tea defence\". Another official said the FBI \"are really pushing the perjury stuff, because they are convinced he lied to them\". Mr Gore was campaigning in Minnesota when news of the justice department recommendation emerged, and appeared to have been taken by surprise. His aides claimed that the information had been leaked for political purposes and insisted that Mr Gore had fully cooperated with the fundraising inquiry. Ms Reno could once more turn down the call for an independent inquiry, but such a decision would provoke damaging Republican claims of a cover-up. Meanwhile, Mr Gore's aides are concerned about the emergence of Ralph Nader as a serious election concern on the left. He is expected to win the Green party nomination, and although his support remains in single-digit figures, he appeals to core Democrats, particularly environmentalists and union members who are unhappy with Mr Clinton's trade deal with China. Mr Gore has been on a nationwide \"prosperity tour\" aimed at capitalising on the healthy state of the economy and presenting his ideas on bolstering social security and government-sponsored health care programmes. But even before news emerged of a possible special counsel investigation, he was still trailing several points behind Mr Bush, especially among men and married couples, for whom the vice- president appears to carry the moral taint of his close friendship with Bill Clinton. Republican posters have focused on that perceived weakness, showing the two men locked in a warm embrace.",

The fresh embarrassment for the force, following the collapse of a two-and-a-half year inquiry into alleged corruption in Mr Mallon's Middlesbrough CID unit earlier this week, raised further questions about the handling of bitter divisions between officers. Mr Justice Henriques singled out for criticism a former leading figure in the Mallon inquiry, Chief Supt Kevin Pitt, for submitting an \"unsolicited\" 94-page statement with 300 pages of appendices only a few days before the trial had been due to start. The judge said: \"His decision to commit his thoughts to a witness statement has resulted in both public expense and judicial delay.\" Det Insp Russ Daglish and Det Con Brendon Whitehead, who both worked closely with Mr Mallon, had been accused of stealing a \u00a320 central heating boiler from a store of crime-related property at Middlesbrough police station. They remain suspended from duty and subject to disciplinary procedures, which the judge said should take place \"as soon as possible\". The collapse of the case followed three days of legal argument at Hull crown court, and also comes three days after the \u00a35m inquiry, known as Operation Lancet, cleared Mr Mallon and seven other officers of wrongdoing. Staying the proceedings, due to abuse of judicial process, Judge Henriques said: \"It has become increasingly clear that a fair trial would be impossible.\" He criticised the mistakes by Cleveland police and added that the huge publicity over Mr Mallon would have made the case untenable. Mr Pitt said that his statement had been made after legal advice, following claims at a pre-trial hearing by another Cleveland superintendent, Dick Mead, who headed the inquiry into the alleged boiler theft. Mr Mead told the hearing that he felt there had been a \"campaign\" to undermine his inquiries and to protect the interests of Operation Lancet. A spokesman for Cleveland police said: \"We will be reviewing what the judge has had to say and the reasons for it. We cannot comment further because there are separate disciplinary matters to be dealt with.\"",

Mr Lammy, from a low income, single parent family, said he knew what it was like to grow up disadvantaged in Tottenham and he pledged to work towards improving his constituency's employment, schools and housing. He said: \"The heartlands of Tottenham are safe in the hands of New Labour.\" Mr Grant first won the seat by 4,000 votes in 1987, but by 1997 his personal popularity had increased his majority to 20,200, making the seat one of Labour's safest. The increase in the Labour majority also reflected demographic changes. Voting figures Tottenham Labour hold David Lammy (Labour) 8,785 (53.51%, -15.77%) Duncan Hames (Liberal Democrat) 3,139 (19.12%, +8.34%) Jane Ellison (Conservative) 2,634 (16.04%, +0.34%) Weyman Bennett (London Socialist Alliance) 885 (5.39%) Peter Budge (Green) 606 (3.69%, +0.88%) Erol Basarik (Reform 2000) 177 (1.08%) Ashwinkumar Tanna (UK Independent) 136 (0.83%) Derek De Braam (Independent Conservative) 55 (0.34%) Labour majority 5,646 (34.39%) Swing 12.05% Labour to Liberal Democrats Electorate 64,554 Turnout 16,417 (25.43%, -31.55%) 1997 Labour majority 20,200 (53.58%) Turnout 37,704 (56.98%) Grant (Lab) 26,121 (69.28%); Scantlebury (C) 5,921 (15.70%); Hughes (LD) 4,064 (10.78%); Budge (Green) 1,059 (2.81%); Tay (ProLife) 210 (0.56%); Anglin (WRP) 181 (0.48%); Kent (SEP) 148 (0.39%)",

      "bodyText": "A Milan prosecutor has begun investigating whether an asthma sufferer died from passive smoking, with a view to charging her employers and colleagues with manslaughter. The victim, identified by Italian newspapers as Stefania C, 25, collapsed at her desk in a Milan bank 10 months ago and died of an acute asthma attack. Employers have in the past been ordered to pay compensation for the effects on health of passive smoking, but this would be the first time in Italian legal history that anyone had been charged with culpable homicide in such a case. The woman, who suffered from chronic bronchial asthma, had been hired under a scheme that gives tax incentives to employers who take on staff with physical handicaps. But her family say she was forced to work in a small, windowless room, surrounded by habitual smokers. Her repeated written requests to be transferred to a healthier environment were allegedly ignored by her employers. The prosecutor, Luca Poniz, is investigating whether those who continued to smoke around her and those who ignored her pleas for help should be charged with manslaughter. The intervention of trade union officials achieved no improvement in Mrs C's working conditions. She returned from work every day with her clothes reeking of smoke and feeling humiliated by the insensitivity of her colleagues, her husband told the prosecutor. Her anxiety at having to work in an airless, smoke-filled room often caused her to break down in tears, he said. Medical experts say passive smoking can increase the chances of developing a lung tumour by 20%, as well as aggravating respiratory illnesses, particularly asthma. According to Francesco Bacchini, a researcher on labour rights at the University of Modena, the entire bank hierarchy could be liable to prosecution. \"There is still no law against passive smoking in Italy, but using an extensive interpretation of other laws on safety in the workplace, there is no doubt that this case has serious penal implications,\" he said. Four years ago the constitutional court established that smoking should only be allowed in the workplace in specially designated rooms or adequately ventilated smoking areas. Mr Poniz will decide if he should go ahead with charges against the bank staff after questioning all those involved in Mrs C's case. His decision is expected by the end of the month.",

      "bodyText": "J Edgar Hoover, the head of the FBI who worked relentlessly to undermine Martin Luther King and others in the civil rights movement in the 1960s, had black ancestors whose existence he desperately tried to keep secret, according to a new book. Millie McGhee, the author of Secrets Uncovered, J Edgar Hoover - Passing For White? is an African-American who says she was told as a little girl in McComb, Mississippi, of her family's links with Hoover. She writes in the book that her grandfather told of her of this \"very powerful\" man in Washington who was related to the family but did not want the links to be known and passed himself off as white. Ms McGhee, a former teacher in Los Angeles, explains that she contacted a genealogist in Salt Lake City, Utah, for help in tracing her family's history back 200 years. She says her research shows that Hoover's grandfather and great-grandfather lived in a segregated black area of Washington and were classified in a census as \"coloured\". Hoover, who was born in 1895 and died while still head of the FBI in 1972, was apparently anxious that no one should know of his origins. According to Ms McGhee, relatives were warned of dire consequences if they spoke publicly of his background. As a little girl she believed that they would be killed if they mentioned the secret. \"Is this man so ashamed of his race that he would spend his whole life passing for white?\" she asks. \"How has our race offended him?\" She believes that his obsession with King and other black civil rights leaders stemmed in part from his repressed anger about his secret life. She told the Guardian yesterday that members of the Hoover family who had contacted her had not been angry about the disclosures, but that her own family were unhappy with her decision to go public. \"They're very upset.\" \"I never wanted to be related to him,\" she said. \"I never even liked him.\" Hoover came from a family that had always worked in government service in Washington. He entered the justice department after graduating in law, became acting director of the FBI in 1929 and was confirmed as director shortly afterwards. He was associated throughout his career with a fierce paranoia about the left and the civil rights movement, and an obsession with pursuing what were seen to be enemies of the United States. A powerful figure during his life, he became the subject of much mockery after his death, when it was claimed that he had enjoyed cross-dressing. Hoover's wire-tapping and hidden surveillance practices took the FBI's involvement in the private lives of US citizens to new levels. After his death it was accepted that no FBI director should ever have such power again. Ms McGhee says that the book is not an expos\u00e9 of Hoover's dishonesty, but more of a cross between \"Roots and Danielle Steel\", in that it catalogues her search to discover the family's secrets.",

Michael Meacher, the minister who takes the lead on green issues in government, has allowed the move despite his public commitment to switching 25% of rubbish from landfill dumps to recycling by 2005. The minister has also agreed to greatly expand the types of toxic waste which the Isle of Man will be able to export to the mainland. The hazardous waste is to be taken to incinerators in Pontypool, South Wales, and Southampton. The toxic materials are being limited to 60 tonnes each for the Channel Islands and Isle of Man. Mr Meacher said yesterday that he had \"reluctantly\" agreed to the sending of hazardous waste from the Channel Islands, following a deal with the Isle of Man to expand the types of waste that can be sent to Britain because of a lack of suitable facilities for disposal there. Disclosure of the transportation of hazardous waste from the Channel Islands emerged after documents were leaked from the Isle of Man over plans to build a \u00a3122m incinerator. A decision on the incinerator was deferred yesterday by the Manx parliament, the Tynwald, after the island's public health department raised environmental and health concerns. The business plan for the new incinerator included plans to export waste to the United Kingdom that had not been agreed with Mr Meacher. This proposal follows a row between the minister and the Isle of Man government over plans to start dumping thousands of tonnes of domestic waste in Britain. In a confidential letter sent by Mr Meacher to David North, Isle of Man trade minister, and obtained by the Guardian, he reveals that the Isle of Man asked to start dumping domestic waste in Britain last year. In 1998 Mr Meacher had agreed to a large increase in the types of hazardous waste which the Isle of Man government could send to the United Kingdom. This agreement tripled from 70 to 205 the number of hazardous waste products which could be dumped in Britain. Among the new products that could be dumped in Britain included arsenic-based wood preservative, diesel oil, crude oil, and methanol.

      "body": "<p>\u0095 It was an ultra-militant docker of the 1960s who, faced with a well-meaning government scheme to end casual labour on the waterfront, called on his brothers to \"fight this diabolical threat of permanent unemployment\". Gordon Brown now knows what he meant. His own constituency contains the Rosyth dockyard, a troubled zone regarding employment opportunities for many decades. In the mid-1980s, a social club was set up for those seeking work, a concrete piece of community action to inspire the labour movement. Fifteen years on, and the honourable member is a chancellor presiding over dwindling dole queues and a booming economy. The Rosyth club, having seen most of its members return to gainful employment, is shutting its doors. It seems the last straw was when even the club secretary found work. </p> <p>\u0095 The Royal Automobile Club foundation, meanwhile, has been investigating the types of music played on in-car stereo systems, with special reference to the different tastes of the owners of different vehicles. Do not accept a lift from anyone driving a Renault Espace - \"a combination of Teletubbies and Lynyrd Skynyrd\" - a Peugeot 306GTi-6 - \"very, very loud dance music\" - an Alfa GTV - \"Dire Straits and Chris Rea\" - or a Jaguar XJ8 - \"Ride of the Valkyries\". More menacing still are Mondeo LX owners - \"a combination of personal motivation tapes and heavy rock music so that the owners can psyche themselves up to 'be first' and 'win, win, win'.\" The briefest entry comes next to the product of troubled Cowley, the Rover 75. It reads simply: \"The blues.\" </p> <p>\u0095 On a similarly tart note, one email doing the rounds allegedly relates to the latest business breakthrough. You have heard of e-commerce, you have heard of m-commerce - that is e-commerce with mobile phones - now meet \"s-commerce\". This, we learn, is truly revolutionary and involves the consumer in visiting conveniently located premises or \"shops\" in which the goods are actually on display. Two-dimensional viewing surfaces, \"mirrors\", are available, allowing consumers to \"try on\" clothes. Most radically, you take the goods away with you, right there and then. A pity it will never catch on. </p> <p>\u0095 Elsewhere on the frontiers of technology, Unisys, the computer group, has collided with traditional British cynicism with the result that a staff incentive scheme is not working as planned at the company's extensive British operations. Unisys routinely invites nominations for \"achievement awards\", and those judged worthy under this internal honours list then have their names gazetted far and wide as examples to follow. Regrettably, the Brits find the whole thing unutterably naff, and treat it as an enormous joke. Worse, there have been cases of star performers begging their colleagues and chiefs not to nominate them lest it damage their reputation. Perhaps Unisys ought to supply its British workers with Mondeo man's \"win, win, win\" motivation tapes. </p> <p>\u0095 KPMG, meanwhile - alias \"the accountants formerly known as Peats\" - is experimenting with a different type of motivation. As of July 1, the company is permanently dumbing down - sorry, that ought to have read \"dressing down\". The new with-it policy will replace a lot of boring accountants in suits with a lot of boring accountants trying to look casual. Funnily enough, as the news broke, an important figure in the business dress debate, Sir Richard Branson, was on the wireless enthusing about Europe's new super jumbo jet. Back in 1986, when Sir Richard's Virgin group was floated, personnel at adviser Morgan Grenfell rolled up at the Waldorf Hotel in crumpled jeans and Supertramp T-shirts, the better to empathise with Virgin's groovy young directors and swinging client base. Sir Richard and his colleagues stole the show in full morning dress. </p> <p>\u0095 And just a word of warning on that super jumbo. Brother Yank, it seems, has decided not to build a similar aeroplane - just as, 30 years ago, he decided not to proceed with the SST, the American version of Concorde. We Europeans, of course, knew better. From an original worst case estimate of \u00a3170m in 1962, Concorde went nearly 12 times over budget, costing \u00a32bn by late 1978. Only 16 of the planned 400 Concordes were ever built, and in 1977 alone, British Airways lost \u00a317m on its Concorde operations. Doubtless the Airbus A3XX will be a tremendous success, but European taxpayers ought to keep a tight hold on their wallets.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 It was an ultra-militant docker of the 1960s who, faced with a well-meaning government scheme to end casual labour on the waterfront, called on his brothers to \"fight this diabolical threat of permanent unemployment\". Gordon Brown now knows what he meant. His own constituency contains the Rosyth dockyard, a troubled zone regarding employment opportunities for many decades. In the mid-1980s, a social club was set up for those seeking work, a concrete piece of community action to inspire the labour movement. Fifteen years on, and the honourable member is a chancellor presiding over dwindling dole queues and a booming economy. The Rosyth club, having seen most of its members return to gainful employment, is shutting its doors. It seems the last straw was when even the club secretary found work. \u0095 The Royal Automobile Club foundation, meanwhile, has been investigating the types of music played on in-car stereo systems, with special reference to the different tastes of the owners of different vehicles. Do not accept a lift from anyone driving a Renault Espace - \"a combination of Teletubbies and Lynyrd Skynyrd\" - a Peugeot 306GTi-6 - \"very, very loud dance music\" - an Alfa GTV - \"Dire Straits and Chris Rea\" - or a Jaguar XJ8 - \"Ride of the Valkyries\". More menacing still are Mondeo LX owners - \"a combination of personal motivation tapes and heavy rock music so that the owners can psyche themselves up to 'be first' and 'win, win, win'.\" The briefest entry comes next to the product of troubled Cowley, the Rover 75. It reads simply: \"The blues.\" \u0095 On a similarly tart note, one email doing the rounds allegedly relates to the latest business breakthrough. You have heard of e-commerce, you have heard of m-commerce - that is e-commerce with mobile phones - now meet \"s-commerce\". This, we learn, is truly revolutionary and involves the consumer in visiting conveniently located premises or \"shops\" in which the goods are actually on display. Two-dimensional viewing surfaces, \"mirrors\", are available, allowing consumers to \"try on\" clothes. Most radically, you take the goods away with you, right there and then. A pity it will never catch on. \u0095 Elsewhere on the frontiers of technology, Unisys, the computer group, has collided with traditional British cynicism with the result that a staff incentive scheme is not working as planned at the company's extensive British operations. Unisys routinely invites nominations for \"achievement awards\", and those judged worthy under this internal honours list then have their names gazetted far and wide as examples to follow. Regrettably, the Brits find the whole thing unutterably naff, and treat it as an enormous joke. Worse, there have been cases of star performers begging their colleagues and chiefs not to nominate them lest it damage their reputation. Perhaps Unisys ought to supply its British workers with Mondeo man's \"win, win, win\" motivation tapes. \u0095 KPMG, meanwhile - alias \"the accountants formerly known as Peats\" - is experimenting with a different type of motivation. As of July 1, the company is permanently dumbing down - sorry, that ought to have read \"dressing down\". The new with-it policy will replace a lot of boring accountants in suits with a lot of boring accountants trying to look casual. Funnily enough, as the news broke, an important figure in the business dress debate, Sir Richard Branson, was on the wireless enthusing about Europe's new super jumbo jet. Back in 1986, when Sir Richard's Virgin group was floated, personnel at adviser Morgan Grenfell rolled up at the Waldorf Hotel in crumpled jeans and Supertramp T-shirts, the better to empathise with Virgin's groovy young directors and swinging client base. Sir Richard and his colleagues stole the show in full morning dress. \u0095 And just a word of warning on that super jumbo. Brother Yank, it seems, has decided not to build a similar aeroplane - just as, 30 years ago, he decided not to proceed with the SST, the American version of Concorde. We Europeans, of course, knew better. From an original worst case estimate of \u00a3170m in 1962, Concorde went nearly 12 times over budget, costing \u00a32bn by late 1978. Only 16 of the planned 400 Concordes were ever built, and in 1977 alone, British Airways lost \u00a317m on its Concorde operations. Doubtless the Airbus A3XX will be a tremendous success, but European taxpayers ought to keep a tight hold on their wallets.",

He claimed he had \"behaved like the perfect gentleman\" towards the sisters.</p> <p>He showed no emotion as the jury of eight women and four men gave their majority verdict but moments later waved to his 21-year-old son Rhodri who had attended throughout the five-day trial. Neither Ms Melvin nor her sister Tiffini was was in court.</p> <p>Outside court, Mr Richards issued a statement saying he was \"delighted\" the case was over and said he wished to resume his political career with \"renewed enthusiasm\".</p> <p>It had been claimed that Mr Richards, of Radyr, Cardiff, had assaulted Ms Melvin on July 27 last year outside her sister's flat in Kew, south-west London.</p> <p>Mr Richards, a former Royal Marine, had travelled to London on business and was staying with his friend Nigel Evans, Tory MP for Ribble Valley.

      "bodyText": "Former Tory minister Rod Richards was yesterday cleared of causing grievous bodily harm to a young woman who claimed he had punched her in the face and broken her arm. A jury at Kingston crown court in south west Londontook nearly five hours to find the 53-year-old Welsh assembly member not guilty of attacking Cassandra Melvin, 23, after he had wined and dined her and her sister last July. Mr Richards, a married father-of-three and former Welsh Office minister in John Major's government, resigned as leader of the Tory group in the assembly to fight the allegation. He claimed he had \"behaved like the perfect gentleman\" towards the sisters. He showed no emotion as the jury of eight women and four men gave their majority verdict but moments later waved to his 21-year-old son Rhodri who had attended throughout the five-day trial. Neither Ms Melvin nor her sister Tiffini was was in court. Outside court, Mr Richards issued a statement saying he was \"delighted\" the case was over and said he wished to resume his political career with \"renewed enthusiasm\". It had been claimed that Mr Richards, of Radyr, Cardiff, had assaulted Ms Melvin on July 27 last year outside her sister's flat in Kew, south-west London. Mr Richards, a former Royal Marine, had travelled to London on business and was staying with his friend Nigel Evans, Tory MP for Ribble Valley. He met Ms Melvin and her 31-year-old sister Tiffini in the Victoria Inn pub in Richmond and later invited them to dinner at a nearby Pizza Express restaurant. After he paid for the \u00a341 meal, the three travelled by taxi to the sisters' flat where the alleged assault was said to have taken place. He admitted to the jury that he had tried to chat the two sisters up and had been less than frank to the police. He also admitted to having a previous conviction for assaulting a taxi driver in 1974 and a police caution in 1997 for failing to mention the conviction when he applied for a firearm and shotgun certificate. The prosecution, led by Nick Wood, alleged that Mr Richards had become violent and abusive when he was asked to leave the flat for making sexually offensive remarks towards the women. But Baroness Ann Mallalieu QC, defending, described the evening as \"the very stuff of middle-aged fantasies\" and a \"classic cautionary tale for a middle-aged man at a loose end in London\". Mr Richards said he was \"shocked and embarrassed\" at being arrested and claimed he had been invited back for coffee by the sisters when the atmosphere suddenly changed and Cassandra Melvin attempted to force him out of the flat. After the verdict, Mr Richards's solicitor, George Keppe, read a statement in which the former minister thanked his wife, children, family and friends for \"their unwavering support throughout what has been an emotionally draining and personally stressful time of his life\" and wished Ms Melvin well for the future. He was \"immensely relieved\" at the jury's verdict. Mr Keppe brushed off questions about a return to the leadership of the Welsh Tories, saying: \"Everything is always possible.\" The Tory whip was withdrawn from Mr Richards in February following a dispute with his colleagues but he remains an assembly member. A spokesman for Conservative central office said: \"We are pleased for Rod Richards and his family that he has been cleared of the charges.\" The Tory chief whip at the Welsh assembly, David Davies, a character witness for Mr Richards in court, said after the verdict: \"I never had any doubt whatsoever he would be found not guilty. It is just not within his character to behave in that fashion.\"",

      "body": "<p>The dean and chapter of Salisbury Cathedral have caused consternation among a group of star architects by turning down all their plans for a modern centre to house the Magna Carta within the church's 800-year-old precincts.</p> <p>The Wiltshire cathedral's refusal of blueprints submitted by a shortlist of six architects - including the world famous Daniel Libeskind - was attacked as \"a snub\" yesterday by the professional magazine Building Design. It accused the dean and chapter of wasting thousands of pounds of architects' money.</p> <p>The magazine reported the decision as \"Rejection at the cathedral\", a headline with deliberate echoes of TS Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral. A total of 86 architects originally entered the running for the design contract.</p> <p>Last night, the cathedral authorities were unrepentant. Their project manager, Chris Watson, said they were determined to wait for a design that would match \"one of the great architectural and building opportunities of the world\".</p> <p>The Magna Carta centre would be the only modern object - apart from Elisabeth Frink's tiny, celebrated statue of a hurrying nun - in the huge medieval cathedral close.</p> <p>\"The site is worthy of a design of absolute excellence,\" Mr Watson said. \"It is a terrifically exciting scheme, but it is very difficult.</p> <p>\"We have not seen anything which matches its complexity. The challenge is to choose a building in today's architecture which will sit with buildings which have been there for 800 years. We want it to be harmonious. The dean and chapter are not going to proceed unless they are absolutely over the moon about what is put forward.</p> <p>\"It's not time-sensitive. Salisbury cathedral has been there for 800 years. We are prepared to wait until we have absolutely the right scheme.\"</p> <p>The site for the visitors' centre, which will store the finest surviving copy of the Magna Carta, is next to cloisters on the south side of the cathedral, which dominates the city. Among architects rejected for the contract were:</p> <p>\u0095Mr Libeskind, architect of the Victoria &amp; Albert museum extension, in London, and the Imperial War Museum of the North, in Manchester.</p> <p>\u0095Steve Marshall, of the partnership Munkenbeck and Marshall, which recently won the Stephen Lawrence prize for its sculpture gallery at Roche Court, near Salisbury. The firm also designed the futuristic Marina 1 on the Regent's Park canal, in London.</p> <p>\u0095David Chipperfield, an award-winning younger architect who re-planned Museum Island in Berlin. He recently displayed models at the Venice Biennale of ambitious new buildings that he is creating on the cemetery island of San Michele, on the Venetian lagoon.</p> <p>\u0095The firm Allies and Morrison, which earlier this month won an award for its use of extruded aluminium at Stratford underground station on the Jubilee line, in London.</p> <p>The others rejected were the partnership Evans and Shalev and the architect Ian Ritchie.</p> <p>Each was given about \u00a33,000 for preparatory work for the cathedral centre. Some, however, are understood to have spent \u00a310,000 or more on their schemes.</p> <p>Yesterday Daniel Libeskind's wife and professional partner Nina Libeskind said she was deeply disappointed: \"There is an old saying in the academic world - if all the students fail, the teacher has failed.</p> <p>\"With this competition, it seems to us that if we have come up with the wrong answer, the wrong question has been asked. Daniel is not exactly someone who fails to deal with these questions.</p> <p>\"I think they might have had the grace to say something along the lines that their thinking had changed after they asked for submissions.\"</p> <p>Mr Libeskind's design is for a circle-topped building next to the cloisters, which spreads down to a traditional square shape of the kind his wife said Leonardo da Vinci had used.</p> <p>Explaining this symbolism, their written submission to the dean and chapter said: \"Like the rectilinear document of the Magna Carta itself, with the circular seal of King John signalling agreement, the building's measure, structure, light and function communicate to the visitor the intertwining of pragmatic and conceptual levels ...</p> <p>\"[This] will give simultaneous access to both the temporal and the eternal; connecting old forms... with the evolving horizons of a democratic world and world citizenship.\"</p> <p>Steve Marshall said his plan was \"possibly the most radical\" on the shortlist. It was an attempt to recreate the uncluttered view of the cathedral which John Constable shows in one of his paintings.</p> <p>Mr Marshall's scheme puts the centre underground, beneath a lake of reflective glass, with an entrance modelled on Runnymede, where the Magna Carta was signed.</p> <p>Yesterday he said: \"Everyone who entered the competition is disappointed. If no one gets it, you are left with a slightly empty feeling. I think there might be some illusion on the cathedral authorities' part that an architect can only come up with one idea.</p> <p>\"We have another 10 ideas. Now that we have heard what they have said, we would like to have another go at it.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The dean and chapter of Salisbury Cathedral have caused consternation among a group of star architects by turning down all their plans for a modern centre to house the Magna Carta within the church's 800-year-old precincts. The Wiltshire cathedral's refusal of blueprints submitted by a shortlist of six architects - including the world famous Daniel Libeskind - was attacked as \"a snub\" yesterday by the professional magazine Building Design. It accused the dean and chapter of wasting thousands of pounds of architects' money. The magazine reported the decision as \"Rejection at the cathedral\", a headline with deliberate echoes of TS Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral. A total of 86 architects originally entered the running for the design contract. Last night, the cathedral authorities were unrepentant. Their project manager, Chris Watson, said they were determined to wait for a design that would match \"one of the great architectural and building opportunities of the world\". The Magna Carta centre would be the only modern object - apart from Elisabeth Frink's tiny, celebrated statue of a hurrying nun - in the huge medieval cathedral close. \"The site is worthy of a design of absolute excellence,\" Mr Watson said. \"It is a terrifically exciting scheme, but it is very difficult. \"We have not seen anything which matches its complexity. The challenge is to choose a building in today's architecture which will sit with buildings which have been there for 800 years. We want it to be harmonious. The dean and chapter are not going to proceed unless they are absolutely over the moon about what is put forward. \"It's not time-sensitive. Salisbury cathedral has been there for 800 years. We are prepared to wait until we have absolutely the right scheme.\" The site for the visitors' centre, which will store the finest surviving copy of the Magna Carta, is next to cloisters on the south side of the cathedral, which dominates the city. Among architects rejected for the contract were: \u0095Mr Libeskind, architect of the Victoria &amp; Albert museum extension, in London, and the Imperial War Museum of the North, in Manchester. \u0095Steve Marshall, of the partnership Munkenbeck and Marshall, which recently won the Stephen Lawrence prize for its sculpture gallery at Roche Court, near Salisbury. The firm also designed the futuristic Marina 1 on the Regent's Park canal, in London. \u0095David Chipperfield, an award-winning younger architect who re-planned Museum Island in Berlin. He recently displayed models at the Venice Biennale of ambitious new buildings that he is creating on the cemetery island of San Michele, on the Venetian lagoon. \u0095The firm Allies and Morrison, which earlier this month won an award for its use of extruded aluminium at Stratford underground station on the Jubilee line, in London. The others rejected were the partnership Evans and Shalev and the architect Ian Ritchie. Each was given about \u00a33,000 for preparatory work for the cathedral centre. Some, however, are understood to have spent \u00a310,000 or more on their schemes. Yesterday Daniel Libeskind's wife and professional partner Nina Libeskind said she was deeply disappointed: \"There is an old saying in the academic world - if all the students fail, the teacher has failed. \"With this competition, it seems to us that if we have come up with the wrong answer, the wrong question has been asked. Daniel is not exactly someone who fails to deal with these questions. \"I think they might have had the grace to say something along the lines that their thinking had changed after they asked for submissions.\" Mr Libeskind's design is for a circle-topped building next to the cloisters, which spreads down to a traditional square shape of the kind his wife said Leonardo da Vinci had used. Explaining this symbolism, their written submission to the dean and chapter said: \"Like the rectilinear document of the Magna Carta itself, with the circular seal of King John signalling agreement, the building's measure, structure, light and function communicate to the visitor the intertwining of pragmatic and conceptual levels ... \"[This] will give simultaneous access to both the temporal and the eternal; connecting old forms... with the evolving horizons of a democratic world and world citizenship.\" Steve Marshall said his plan was \"possibly the most radical\" on the shortlist. It was an attempt to recreate the uncluttered view of the cathedral which John Constable shows in one of his paintings. Mr Marshall's scheme puts the centre underground, beneath a lake of reflective glass, with an entrance modelled on Runnymede, where the Magna Carta was signed. Yesterday he said: \"Everyone who entered the competition is disappointed. If no one gets it, you are left with a slightly empty feeling. I think there might be some illusion on the cathedral authorities' part that an architect can only come up with one idea. \"We have another 10 ideas. Now that we have heard what they have said, we would like to have another go at it.\"",

      "bodyText": "The United States was accused of playing a large part in the campaign of anti-communist terrorism in Italy during the cold war, in a report released yesterday by the Left Democrat party. The explicit accusation is contained in a draft report to a parliamentary commission on terrorism. The formerly communist LDP is the biggest party in Giuliano Amato's centre-left government, and the report could sour relations between Italy and the United States and unleash a storm of domestic political controversy. The 300-page report says that the United States was responsible for inspiring a \"strategy of tension\" in which indiscriminate bombing of the public and the threat of a rightwing coup were used to stabilise centre-right political control of the country. Those who carried out the attacks were rarely caught, it said, because \"those massacres, those bombs, those military actions had been organised or promoted or supported by men inside Italian state institutions and, as has been discovered more recently, by men linked to the structures of United States intelligence\". Valter Bielli, a Left Democrat member of parliament and one of the authors of the report, said his party's conclusions were based on recent judicial discoveries and a re-elaboration of information that had been available for many years but had not been adequately understood. \"I am convinced that the intervention of the Americans in Italy is now a historically proven fact,\" he said. \"They interfered to prevent the Communist party from achieving power by democratic means. The communist threat no longer exists and it would be appropriate if the Americans themselves helped us to clarify what happened in the past.\" Mr Bielli said he was worried about the possible implications of the report for relations between Italy and the US, but he hoped it would contribute to the creation of a new Nato in which all countries enjoyed equal weight and dignity. \"During the cold war the east was under communist domination, but the west too had become, in a certain sense, an American colony,\" he said. The report claims that US intelligence agents were informed in advance about several rightwing terrorist bombings, including the December 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing in Milan and the Piazza della Loggia bombing in Brescia five years later, but did nothing to alert the Italian authorities or to prevent the attacks from taking place. It also alleges that Pino Rauti, a journalist and founder of the far-right Ordine Nuovo (new order) subversive organ isation, received regular funding from a press officer at the US embassy in Rome. \"So even before the 'stabilising' plans that Atlantic circles had prepared for Italy became operational through the bombings, one of the leading members of the subversive right was literally in the pay of the American embassy in Rome,\" the report says. Mr Rautinow heads the small rightwing MSI Fiamma-Tricolore party, and suggestions that he and other rightwing politicians still actively involved in parliamentary politics had failed to cut their links to terrorist extremists have drawn furious rebuttals from the centre-right opposition. The National Alliance leader, Gianfranco Fini, described the document as a \"miserable report\" and the centrist Republican party said it was worthy of a 1970s Maoist group. \"These are allegations that have come up over the last 20 years and there is absolutely nothing to them,\" a source at the US embassy in Rome said. To Aldo Giannuli, a historian who works as a consultant to the parliamentary terrorism commission, the release of the Left Democrats' report is a manoeuvre dictated primarily by domestic political considerations. \"Since they have been in power the Left Democrats have given us very little help in gaining access to security service archives,\" he said. \"This is a falsely courageous report. The real issue today is gaining access to Nato's archives. There has been no impulse on this front from the government.\"",

Allied Domecq was 16p higher at 359p as investors speculated that the drinks group may be keen to snatch the Seagram drinks side if the deal between Vivendi and Seagram is given the green light. Where once the link to all things internet provoked a positive response from investors, it seems the opposite is now true. Continuing worries over the cost of sustaining an online version of their businesses proved a drag on the shares of the banks. Barclays was 52p lower at \u00a315.67, Lloyds TSB was off 7p at 603.5p and Abbey National closed 21p down at 750.5p. Barclays came under additional pressure from investment bank UBS Warburg which downgraded its recommendation to hold from strong buy on the stock and cut its price target to \u00a318 from \u00a320 a share. A strong performance on Wall Street in early trading underpinned the FTSE 100 index of leading shares which closed 22.3 points lower at 6391.5. Marks &amp; Spencer fell back 7p to 235p after the retailer launched its summer sale - a move which sparked fears that continued poor trading has forced it to begin discounting early. Analysts were suggesting that like-for-like clothing sales are still on the decline despite attempts to refresh the retailer's offer. \"We are hearing that in the last three weeks clothing sales are down 7%-8%,\" said one.

However, this was abandoned after both companies failed to reach agreement on its structure. Shares in Rio Tinto rose 28p to \u00a310.18 yesterday. The bid represents a 30% premium on North's closing price of 122p on Thursday.",

They were made before wood carvings or lithographs were invented and certainly before photocomposition allowed the use of original pen and ink drawings in illustration.</p> <p>Gillray would often run off hundreds in one day - the equivalent of a Steve Bell cartoon in the Guardian today. Gillray only illustrated one book and his work can be even cheaper than his contemporary Stothard, who painted watercolours.</p> <p>But they might not remain cheap. They are becoming increasingly rare with the passage of time, even though printed in volume. Next year the Tate Modern is planning an exhibition of Gillray's work.

They were made before wood carvings or lithographs were invented and certainly before photocomposition allowed the use of original pen and ink drawings in illustration. Gillray would often run off hundreds in one day - the equivalent of a Steve Bell cartoon in the Guardian today. Gillray only illustrated one book and his work can be even cheaper than his contemporary Stothard, who painted watercolours. But they might not remain cheap. They are becoming increasingly rare with the passage of time, even though printed in volume. Next year the Tate Modern is planning an exhibition of Gillray's work. This always does wonders for prices. \u0095 Phillips, tel: 020-7495-0227.",

The president's mother, sister and other relatives have flown to Canada. Duncan Campbell, Los Angeles Rare victory for Serb opposition The general manager of the Yugoslav state news agency, Tanjug, has been fined for libelling two opposition leaders, the agency said yesterday - a rare conviction against a loyal official of President Slobodan Milosevic's government. Dusan Djordjevic was ordered by a local judge to pay about \u00a3350 after Zoran Djindjic and Vladan Batic sued, saying their rights had been violated by a Tanjug article accusing them of raising political tension. But the fine was small compared those imposed on the independent and opposition media. Unpopular and facing an election, Mr Milosevic has stepped up pressure on dissenters. Yesterday the government launched legal proceedings against the main printing press used by independent newspapers and non-government publications in Serbia. AP, Belgrade Work-to-death firm pays family Japan's biggest advertising company, Dentsu, admitted liability yesterday for the suicide of an overworked employee and agreed to pay the man's parents 168m yen (about \u00a31m). The supreme court ruled against Dentsu in March: the first time a company had been found liable for a case of karoshi - death from overwork. Ichiro Oshima killed himself in 1991 at the age of 24 after working an average of 80 hours a week, sometimes on shifts from 9am until 6am the next day. Reuters, Tokyo Kennedy crash was pilot error Nearly a year after John Kennedy Jr's plane crashed into the sea, killing him, his wife and her sister, transport investigators have decided that their initial suspicions were correct: the son of the late US president became disoriented in the night sky and lost control of the plane.

      "body": "<p>The American melting pot boils particularly hot in south Texas. Few musicians demonstrated its effects more dramatically than the bandleader Adolph Hofner, who has died aged 83. In a career extending over more than half a century, he produced a unique, all-American alloy of country crooning, polkas and western swing.</p> <p>He was born in Moulton, between Houston and San Antonio. His father was part-German and his mother Czech; he spoke Czech as his first language, and the first music he remembered was that of polka bands playing for community dances. Soon the gramophone introduced him to more mainstream idioms, including the then popular Hawaiian music.</p> <p>\"That's what got me and my brother started on strings,\" Hofner recalled, \"Hawaiian guitars.\" He and Emil, who was two years younger, took a guitar course, called themselves the Hawaiian Serenaders and began playing in San Antonio clubs, where the family had moved, for 40 or 50 cents a night.</p> <p>\"My main object,\" said Hofner, \"was to sing.\" He listened to the records and broadcasts of the new crooners, Bing Crosby and Russ Columbo. Then, in the mid-1930s, he was inspired by the fresh, and deeply Texan, sound of western swing, especially the brilliant band led by Fort Worth's Milton Brown.</p> <p>\"I even changed my style of singing to try to sound like Milton,\" said Hofner. \"So I got into this western [music] because that's what was paying off, but I kept my popular right along with it.\" He joined another swing band, Jimmie Revard's Oklahoma Playboys, and toured with them through the Rio Grande valley - but their music was too jazzy and modern for small-town taste, and they ended up, as he remembered feelingly 40 years later, eating \"boloney for breakfast, dinner and supper.\"</p> <p>For a couple of years, Hofner bobbed up on various bands' records as rhythm guitarist and featured vocalist.

      "bodyText": "The American melting pot boils particularly hot in south Texas. Few musicians demonstrated its effects more dramatically than the bandleader Adolph Hofner, who has died aged 83. In a career extending over more than half a century, he produced a unique, all-American alloy of country crooning, polkas and western swing. He was born in Moulton, between Houston and San Antonio. His father was part-German and his mother Czech; he spoke Czech as his first language, and the first music he remembered was that of polka bands playing for community dances. Soon the gramophone introduced him to more mainstream idioms, including the then popular Hawaiian music. \"That's what got me and my brother started on strings,\" Hofner recalled, \"Hawaiian guitars.\" He and Emil, who was two years younger, took a guitar course, called themselves the Hawaiian Serenaders and began playing in San Antonio clubs, where the family had moved, for 40 or 50 cents a night. \"My main object,\" said Hofner, \"was to sing.\" He listened to the records and broadcasts of the new crooners, Bing Crosby and Russ Columbo. Then, in the mid-1930s, he was inspired by the fresh, and deeply Texan, sound of western swing, especially the brilliant band led by Fort Worth's Milton Brown. \"I even changed my style of singing to try to sound like Milton,\" said Hofner. \"So I got into this western [music] because that's what was paying off, but I kept my popular right along with it.\" He joined another swing band, Jimmie Revard's Oklahoma Playboys, and toured with them through the Rio Grande valley - but their music was too jazzy and modern for small-town taste, and they ended up, as he remembered feelingly 40 years later, eating \"boloney for breakfast, dinner and supper.\" For a couple of years, Hofner bobbed up on various bands' records as rhythm guitarist and featured vocalist. His 1938 recording of It Makes No Difference Now, with Tom Dickey's Showboys, was a jukebox hit in Texas, and he was signed to the same label, RCA Victor's Bluebird, as a bandleader in his own right - though the Bluebird scout saw his future mainly as a singer of western-flavoured pop songs. The scout, Hofner recalled, aimed to make another Crosby out of him - and, indeed, his recording of Maria Elena had the same ambience of wide, sunlit plains as Bing's Don't Fence Me In. At the same 1940 session, Hofner made polka recordings for Bluebird's foreign-language catalogue, the band's up-to-date sound of twin fiddles and amplified steel guitar curiously contrasting with Adolph and Emil's close-harmony duets in Czech. In 1941, Hofner made what he believed to be the first record of the exuberant Texas dance tune, Cotton-Eyed Joe. That, and other hit records, put him on the circuit of dance-halls around Los Angeles, catering to the thousands of Americans who had deserted the southwest for war work in the shipyards and munitions factories of southern California. Concerned about the effect of his name, he carefully billed his personal appearances as by Dolph Hofner &amp; His San Antonians, but his new label, Okeh Records - after initially promoting him as the \"husky he-man, leader of one of the west's outstanding string bands\" - nervously cut back his releases, and soon let him go. The late 1940s and early 50s saw a revival of polka music in Polish, Czech and German communities throughout the United States, and Hofner, back in San Antonio, concentrated on playing the tunes of his youth, in settings that evoked his varied musical experi ence, partnered, as ever, by Emil, playing his little Rickenbacker steel guitar.

      "body": "<p> As an artform, dance exists only at the moment of performance, but it is lovingly embalmed in the memories of its public. In the life of all fans there comes a point when they start to believe that dancers don't (and can't) perform the way they used to. This is a position of infuriating smugness to others. Young dancers rage at being judged by the ghosts of the past, while novice dance-goers are made to feel they are seeing only a dim echo of what was granted their elders.</p> <p> The Kirov, as the world's greatest living ballet museum, inspires this generational oneupmanship all the time. When the company visited Britain in 1988 after 18 years' absence, older fans were quick to compare it with remembered glory days. Now those of us who became besotted with the company 12 years ago are showing our age by fretting over certain changes, especially among the company's youngest ballerinas.</p> <p> The 24-year-old Diana Vishneva, for instance, is a dancer of exhilarating speed and attack who has developed a style that looks far more international than previous generations. Her power and personality illuminate comedy ballets such as Don Quixote and the 20th-century repertory (she has been outstanding this season in Balanchine's Rubies), but in the more classical context of Sleeping Beauty her qualities can jar, especially when compared with the very traditional Aurora danced by Zhanna Ayupova.</p> <p> At 33, Ayupova is one of the few remaining principals trained in what has become old-school Kirov. This is a style more sculptural than linear, in which movements are embellished by a contrapuntal activity of head, eyes, shoulders and hands. Its beauties can be breathtakingly flukey, because they combine so many nuances of style and expression. It is also highly sociable, because each move connects spatially and dramatically to everything else on stage. When Ayupova dances, the focus of her gestures and her glance is always directed outside her: she isn't isolated within her own technical prowess.</p> <p> By contrast, Uliana Lopatkina, 26, is a one-woman phenomenon whose boneless fluency and eerily extended line have become the ideal of her generation. Lopatkina moves as if her body were tuned by a far more sophisticated technology than the rest of us. But her exquisitely long lines are achieved at a cost. She is a dancer who is all limbs and feet, and her torso, which should be a radiant and responsive focus of energy, is a blank.</p> <p> There are dramatic and musical dead points in her style as a consequence. So while her Nikiya in Monday's Bayad\u00e8re was a marvel of supple control, it felt monochrome compared with performances I remember from Altynai Asylmuratova (who dances the role tonight).

      "bodyText": "As an artform, dance exists only at the moment of performance, but it is lovingly embalmed in the memories of its public. In the life of all fans there comes a point when they start to believe that dancers don't (and can't) perform the way they used to. This is a position of infuriating smugness to others. Young dancers rage at being judged by the ghosts of the past, while novice dance-goers are made to feel they are seeing only a dim echo of what was granted their elders. The Kirov, as the world's greatest living ballet museum, inspires this generational oneupmanship all the time. When the company visited Britain in 1988 after 18 years' absence, older fans were quick to compare it with remembered glory days. Now those of us who became besotted with the company 12 years ago are showing our age by fretting over certain changes, especially among the company's youngest ballerinas. The 24-year-old Diana Vishneva, for instance, is a dancer of exhilarating speed and attack who has developed a style that looks far more international than previous generations. Her power and personality illuminate comedy ballets such as Don Quixote and the 20th-century repertory (she has been outstanding this season in Balanchine's Rubies), but in the more classical context of Sleeping Beauty her qualities can jar, especially when compared with the very traditional Aurora danced by Zhanna Ayupova. At 33, Ayupova is one of the few remaining principals trained in what has become old-school Kirov. This is a style more sculptural than linear, in which movements are embellished by a contrapuntal activity of head, eyes, shoulders and hands. Its beauties can be breathtakingly flukey, because they combine so many nuances of style and expression. It is also highly sociable, because each move connects spatially and dramatically to everything else on stage. When Ayupova dances, the focus of her gestures and her glance is always directed outside her: she isn't isolated within her own technical prowess. By contrast, Uliana Lopatkina, 26, is a one-woman phenomenon whose boneless fluency and eerily extended line have become the ideal of her generation. Lopatkina moves as if her body were tuned by a far more sophisticated technology than the rest of us. But her exquisitely long lines are achieved at a cost. She is a dancer who is all limbs and feet, and her torso, which should be a radiant and responsive focus of energy, is a blank. There are dramatic and musical dead points in her style as a consequence. So while her Nikiya in Monday's Bayad\u00e8re was a marvel of supple control, it felt monochrome compared with performances I remember from Altynai Asylmuratova (who dances the role tonight). At 39, Asylmuratova may be in decline as far as technique goes, but she can still work the musical and dramatic alchemy by which familiar, even hokey, classical roles are made profound. A new ballerina coming through the ranks is 21-year-old Veronika Part, who closely resembles Lopatkina in the near-frictionless action of her legs and arms (although she lacks the absolute control that produces Lopatkina's peculiar grace). In Sleeping Beauty, Part has been a Lilac Fairy of some charm, but as Odette/Odile she moves in an introverted trance. This new breed of superballerinas have honed and glossed their techniques to awesome extremes, but at the expense of personality and imagination. This season has given fewer opportunities to the Kirov's men - most of them have gone to Igor Zelensky, a freelance who returns to the Kirov, his home company, whenever his schedule allows. Zelensky started the season looking jetlagged and distracted, and when he danced Swan Lake with Part their pas de deux looked under-rehearsed. On Monday though, as Solor to Lopatkina's Nikiya, he was dancing as well as I've seen him.

He was born in south-eastern Lyon and the city's airport will be named after him during forthcoming months of intense national commemorations that coincide with a flood of books, broadcasts and conferences. </p> <p> The chateau at Saint-Maurice de Rem\u00e9ns, central to his idyllic recollections of childhood, will become the seat of an international foundation to complement another institute in Paris and a rash of renamed avenues, schools and public buildings. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry is the only 20th-century writer to figure on a French banknote and will soon have his own set of stamps. </p> <p>Some may feel that all this is a little extravagant for an author who had not the intellectual capacity of Jean-Paul Sartre, nor the story-telling skill of Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, nor the charisma of Andr\u00e9 Malraux: three of the many rivals trailing behind in the glory stakes. Adulation for Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, the repentant supporter of the wartime Vichy regime [which operated during the Nazi occupation], who sacrificed his life to regain his honour, arouses extravagant homage. To his great-niece, Nathalie des Valli\u00e8res, who runs the Paris institute, he is \"the archangel\". To his mistress, Nelly de Vog\u00fc\u00e9, now 92, he remains \"Christ-like\", and as far as his literary executor, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric d'Agay, is concerned: </p> <p>\"You will never understand Saint-Exup\u00e9ry unless you see him as a modern knight-errant of the highest moral principles.\" So far so good. Except there is a ghost hovering over this canoni sation ceremony. His widow, the exuberant Latin-American Consuelo Suncin, who died in 1979, is attracting almost as much attention with the posthumous publication of her vitriolic memoirs and the first biography tracing the transformation of an amoral woman into Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's idealised representation of femininity, the Rose, in the classic children's book, The Little Prince (1943).</p> <p> \"My greatest regret is not dedicating the book to you,\" Saint-Exup\u00e9ry wrote after completing his fable while in American exile, during a reconciliation with his estranged wife. Decoded, the central theme of the allegory parallels Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own wanderlust, his contempt for the consumer age, his meeting with other \"roses\", and his recognition that he had made a commitment to take care of the unique flower on asteroid B-612, for all her vanity.</p> <p> \"I should have judged her by her deeds not her words,\" he writes in the book, which is less a childlike fantasy than a parable about the obligations of conjugal love. \"Tonio\" and Consuelo, a literary groupie who saw herself as the Alma Mahler of Central America, met in 1930 in Buenos Aires. He was a mail-service pilot living out the adventures that inspired his 1931 novel, Night Flight, and she was there to collect the widow's pension for her second husband, Enrique Gomez Carrillo, a Guatemalan writer and Argentina's consul-general in Paris. </p> <p>She was nearly 30 and Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was nine months older. Both had led reckless lives. Antoine, who was three when his father died, had been fascinated by aviation since his first flight at the age of 12 and had qualified as a pilot during national service. In 1926, he joined the A\u00e9ropostale service, and between then and his marriage in April 1931, he survived spectacular crashes, desert storms, rebel attacks and pioneered the airline route from Buenos Aires to Patagonia, all of which provided material for his 1938 collection of newspaper articles, Wind, Sand and Stars. Consuelo, daughter of a Pipil Indian coffee planter in El Salvador, was 19 years old when she abandoned a 60-year-old poet-lawyer fiance, before marrying a dashing Mexican captain in the US. </p> <p> She was widowed a few months later during the civil war with Pancho Villa: then dumped another lover to become the mistress of Jose Vasconcelos, a Mexican intellectual and failed presidential candidate who nicknamed her a \"tropical Scheherazade\". During an exile in Paris where Consuelo joined him, Vasconcelos assembled the notes for the middle volume of his autobiography, The Torment, in which he describes his passion for a woman \"with a viper's tongue and a musical body\" who drove him wild with jealousy. </p> <p> After she left him for the bisexual Gomez Carrillo, Vasconcelos, in revenge, immortalised her under the nickname of Charito, Spain's most notorious striptease artist. Only after Consuelo had assuaged another passion with the erotically supercharged Italian author, Gabriele d'Annunzio, did she marry Tonio on the recommendation of the Belgian writer, Maurice Maeterlinck.</p> <p> He saw the aristocratic pilot as potentially \"the best French writer of the 20th century\". This was remarkable prescience. Saint-Ex still tops the all-time national best seller list with The Little Prince, which has been translated into about 100 languages, and has a million international sales a year; it was voted France's most popular 20th-century book in a millennium media poll. Three of his books are in French all-time top 20. </p> <p>Andr\u00e9 Gide, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's literary godfather, had no time for Consuelo, who was also dismissed by one of her in-laws, Simone de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, as a \"tart\" and a \"Comtesse du cin\u00e9ma\". The denigration has not decreased 20 years after her death. \"Marrying a foreigner was considered worse than marrying a Jew,\" one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's family told me, summing up the monarchist, anti-semitic and fiercely xenophobic family whose nobility dates back to the 12th century. </p> <p> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry broke away from many of its suffocating principles, not least the anti-semitism: his wartime work, Flight To Arras, was banned by both the Nazis and the Vichy government because he had praised the courage of a Jewish officer. Marrying Consuelo, after a coup de foudre while he was taking her for a spin over Buenos Aires, was another break from convention.</p> <p> Family embarrassment at his defiance of aristocratic tradition can be inferred from the first biography, written by Nelly de Vog\u00fc\u00e9 in 1949 under the pen-name Pierre Chevrier. Nelly, one of France's richest women, dismisses Consuelo in a dozen words, and Consuelo disappeared from subsequent books on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's life until I \"rehabilitated\" her in my 1993 biography. To Saint-Exup\u00e9ry purists, that book was iconclastic. Mentioning some of his weaker characteristics, including compulsive womanising, unimpressive aviation skills, childishness and egoism, often causes a rumpus during public debates where Saint-Ex fans are as zealous as religious fundamentalists. But a frank assessment of character caused less reaction then revelations about his attachment to the wartime Vichy regime and his hatred for De Gaulle, whom he described as a \"new Hitler\", thus offending the Free French leader so deeply that De Gaulle joined the Nazis and Vichy in banning Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's writings. </p> <p> The author's distant support for Vichy in the first three years of the war still enrages both Gaullists and the left, who consider Saint-Exup\u00e9ry little more than a outmoded sentimental reactionary. But the debate has been eclipsed by accusations of hypocrisy: he preached solidarity among men while treating women with contempt.</p> <p> \"Why can't you be here to wipe my brow and make me tea?\" he complained in a letter to Consuelo; he accused her of wrecking his life by constant party-going. It seems that Consuelo's belated answer has come with the publication of a long-forgotten manuscript - now published as The Rose's Memoir - giving her view of the 13-year marriage. In this, she accuses her husband of making her suffer all the evils of absences and love affairs that she was supposed to have inflicted on him. </p> <p>According to the typescript, finished in 1947, he was cruel, negligent, greedy, self-centred and wasteful. He abandoned her in a psychiatric hospital; and, when they were living separately, tricked her into letting him sleep in her house to scupper divorce proceedings, because he depended on the fortune she inherited from Gomez Carrillo. The work is an ugly account by a very embittered widow. She had second thoughts about releasing it, and never showed it to a publisher; but 21 years after her death, her heirs have the satisfaction of seeing at the top of the non-fiction list.</p> <p> It has begun a feud with the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry family, which feels justified in excluding Consuelo's photo from bookshop centenary exhibitions and conferences sponsored by the family. Almost at the last minute, the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry supporters have been given a remarkable weapon - the accusation that Consuelo did not, in fact, write the book. At best, it is argued, she dictated the work to her lover, Denis de Rougement, the Swiss author of L'Amour Et L'Occident (Consuelo rejected his offers of marriage because he was \"too Protestant\"). </p> <p>He is the voice of the wise Fox in The Little Prince. Curtis Cate, an American biographer who knew Consuelo, is among those who believe that the book is a really a fiction, recalling that she was a \"born liar\" who constantly rewrote her life story to make herself out a victim. Even more damaging for the book's credibility is an investigation by a Swiss journalist, Christian Campich, who published a police analysis showing that a page of the manuscript released as a proof that Consuelo was the author was in the handwriting of De Rougement. </p> <p> There are enough inconsistencies and fabricated sequences in the memoirs to make them merely interesting documents rather than true accounts, but from a literary point of view there is a worse betrayal than that of the disgruntled rose. De Rougemont was a close friend of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, helping him create The Little Prince, and yet he seems to have collaborated in the writing of these 275 pages of character assassination. </p> <p> The centenary celebrations will probably play down the conjugal row until June 29, when the pres ident and poets will join in a panegyric to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. But after, Consuelo's own centenary will be celebrated with a French film of her life, scheduled to begin shooting in the autumn. There are many twists in the plot, including her decision to take her revenge on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's haughty family by leaving her half-share of all the writer's royalties (as well as her house) to her gardener-chauffeur, Jose Fructuoso Martinez, who owns a mass of documents that can only be published when the quarrelling heirs come to some agreement. </p> <p> Among them are at least 500 love letters. Meanwhile, the battle to extinguish her memory continues. Reference to her has been expunged from all the ceremonies organised by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry supporters, including the three days of celebrations in Lyon. \"We just don't want anything to do with Consuelo,\" D'Agay says. </p> <p> The boycott is justified by Nathalie des Valli\u00e8res, bywho says that Consuelo was \"not a Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\". There are many reasons to believe that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, missing in action, would not approve of the boycott of his wife's memory. An underwater search for his plane led to the recent discovery of part of the missing P-38 Lightning aircraft and recovered a silver identity bracelet engraved with the names Antoine and Consuelo. Romantics see the bracelet as Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's last sign of devotion, a message from the deep to discredit the anti-Consuelo lobby. </p> <p> Even more eloquent is this extract from one of his last love letters, written from a North African airforce base: \"Consuelo, thank you from the bottom of my heart for being my wife. If I am wounded, I have the one who will take care of me. If I am killed I will have the one I want to wait for in eternity. Consuelo, all our legal wranglings, all our disputes are dead.\" Or so he thought.</p>",

She had second thoughts about releasing it, and never showed it to a publisher; but 21 years after her death, her heirs have the satisfaction of seeing at the top of the non-fiction list. It has begun a feud with the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry family, which feels justified in excluding Consuelo's photo from bookshop centenary exhibitions and conferences sponsored by the family. Almost at the last minute, the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry supporters have been given a remarkable weapon - the accusation that Consuelo did not, in fact, write the book. At best, it is argued, she dictated the work to her lover, Denis de Rougement, the Swiss author of L'Amour Et L'Occident (Consuelo rejected his offers of marriage because he was \"too Protestant\"). He is the voice of the wise Fox in The Little Prince. Curtis Cate, an American biographer who knew Consuelo, is among those who believe that the book is a really a fiction, recalling that she was a \"born liar\" who constantly rewrote her life story to make herself out a victim. Even more damaging for the book's credibility is an investigation by a Swiss journalist, Christian Campich, who published a police analysis showing that a page of the manuscript released as a proof that Consuelo was the author was in the handwriting of De Rougement. There are enough inconsistencies and fabricated sequences in the memoirs to make them merely interesting documents rather than true accounts, but from a literary point of view there is a worse betrayal than that of the disgruntled rose. De Rougemont was a close friend of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, helping him create The Little Prince, and yet he seems to have collaborated in the writing of these 275 pages of character assassination. The centenary celebrations will probably play down the conjugal row until June 29, when the pres ident and poets will join in a panegyric to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. But after, Consuelo's own centenary will be celebrated with a French film of her life, scheduled to begin shooting in the autumn. There are many twists in the plot, including her decision to take her revenge on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's haughty family by leaving her half-share of all the writer's royalties (as well as her house) to her gardener-chauffeur, Jose Fructuoso Martinez, who owns a mass of documents that can only be published when the quarrelling heirs come to some agreement. Among them are at least 500 love letters. Meanwhile, the battle to extinguish her memory continues. Reference to her has been expunged from all the ceremonies organised by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry supporters, including the three days of celebrations in Lyon. \"We just don't want anything to do with Consuelo,\" D'Agay says. The boycott is justified by Nathalie des Valli\u00e8res, bywho says that Consuelo was \"not a Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\". There are many reasons to believe that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, missing in action, would not approve of the boycott of his wife's memory. An underwater search for his plane led to the recent discovery of part of the missing P-38 Lightning aircraft and recovered a silver identity bracelet engraved with the names Antoine and Consuelo. Romantics see the bracelet as Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's last sign of devotion, a message from the deep to discredit the anti-Consuelo lobby. Even more eloquent is this extract from one of his last love letters, written from a North African airforce base: \"Consuelo, thank you from the bottom of my heart for being my wife. If I am wounded, I have the one who will take care of me. If I am killed I will have the one I want to wait for in eternity. Consuelo, all our legal wranglings, all our disputes are dead.\" Or so he thought.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A new report by the market analysts Datamonitor credits TV chefs such as Delia Smith for the great interest the British now have in cooking, or at least in watching cookery programmes. But I suspect it would be appalling to visit TV chefs at home. </p> <p>If you went to the Smiths in Norwich, there'd be the slightly embarrassed joke: \"Is this a Delia, then? Ha ha!\" followed by a rather long silence, broken only by a tedious discussion of Norwich City's promotion prospects. At Jamie Oliver's, he'd \"whack the old plate\" in front of you - then run outside for a wet sponge fight with his nephews. At Antonio Carluccio's there would be four generations round the table, which is fine in theory, but would mean your sleeve would be constantly plucked by an old lady in black telling you what a good boy Antonio was. Clarissa Dickson-Wright would have eaten it all before you were even served. </p> <p>The worst would be a Masterchef dinner with Loyd Grossman. \"En neow, filo parcels of salmon and foie gras, enriched with a coulis of raspberry and Pernod...\" You'd spend the whole meal running outside to throw up. </p> <p>\u0095 \"Hanoi Jane\" Fonda has got religion, and now attends a black church in Atlanta. I'm always puzzled that when somebody switches from one absurd, extreme and unworkable set of beliefs to another - consider the likes of Paul Johnson, Peter Hitchens and Sir Alfred Sherman - the rest of us are supposed to sit back and applaud their choice. Frankly I'm as moved as I would be if a football maniac solemnly told me he had changed his allegiance from West Ham to Millwall. </p> <p> My theory about football violence, for what it's worth, is that it's the inevitable result of the game being so dull. Oh I know people hammer on about \"the beautiful game\" but it's actually rather dreary. This is because, unlike American football or rugby, the players have to get the ball to one end without using the most obvious means, their hands and arms. Thus handicapped, they can offer all the excitement of a three-legged race. There's skill all right, but there is in card tricks, and they get boring after 10 minutes too. </p> <p>The result is that a football match can only be enjoyed if you care deeply about the result. Nobody could conceivably watch, say, Derby v Southampton, with any pleasure if the outcome didn't matter to them. Rabid partisanship is the only point. </p> <p>I remember going to watch the Cleveland Indians play the New York Yankees, who, having the best historical track record and being the most hated team, are the Man U of baseball. The Yankees won, but the fans trooped out into downtown Cleveland cheerfully looking for beer and pizza. This was because it had been an excellent and exciting game, enjoyed even by a uninvolved onlooker like me. </p> <p>\u0095 But yobbery is now engrained in our national life. Last Saturday, I was walking round Twickenham (there was no rugby on) and a group of eight young men had been getting tanked up ready for the match in the evening. They marched down the street, half of them bare-chested, chanting, shouting at women, and, on arriving at a beauty salon, wobbling their bellies up against the glass. Nothing they did was illegal, but everything was anti-social. </p> <p>Of course nobody even looked surprised; this kind of thing is just part of the street furniture in modern Britain, like bus stops and Boots. On Wednesday I was waiting at Waterloo for a train which was just back from Ascot. Some of the racegoers were drunk, even the ones with those class-identifying cardboard tags, and some were singing. The train they'd just left was filthy, a mass of racing pages, drinks cans and junk. </p> <p>The trouble is that we don't have a language to say we're annoyed and offended by this without sounding like a Daily Mail reader who dim-wittedly blames it all on Roy Jenkins and Shirley Williams. </p> <p>\u0095 Mind you, football commentators still provide the fun so obviously lacking in the game. It's because they live in such a closed, football-intensive world, that they can't hear what they're saying or put it in a wider context. Which is why, when I switched on at the end of the France v Holland, match and a substitution was taking place, I heard the commentator say excitedly: \"Winter now has a record number of Dutch caps!\" </p> <p>\u0095 Watching Amis On Amis on ITV this week, I heard again Kingsley's famous plea for honest advertising: \"Bowen's Beer - it makes you drunk.\" But all advertising has a message, often as direct. The Wonderbra ads - \"Hello boys\"; \"Mind if I bring two friends?\" - openly said: \"If you wear this, men will think you're available.\" Then next day I stood on the southbound Victoria line platform at Oxford Circus, and saw 18 huge posters of Anna Kournikova, advertising a sports bra. These gigantic identical women, stretching the length of the platform, make an almost overwhelming sight. </p> <p>Yet the iconography is completely different from the Wonderbra poster. Ms Kournikova, who has a pleasant smile, is scowling here, and her hand rests aggressively on her hip. The bra itself is all straps and strengthening, so it looks like a strait jacket. The slogan, \"Only the ball should bounce\" means two things: to women, it says, \"Protect your breast tissue from damage.\" To men it says, \"Watch the tennis, not my body.\" In short, it's advertising the player's non-availability.

      "bodyText": "A new report by the market analysts Datamonitor credits TV chefs such as Delia Smith for the great interest the British now have in cooking, or at least in watching cookery programmes. But I suspect it would be appalling to visit TV chefs at home. If you went to the Smiths in Norwich, there'd be the slightly embarrassed joke: \"Is this a Delia, then? Ha ha!\" followed by a rather long silence, broken only by a tedious discussion of Norwich City's promotion prospects. At Jamie Oliver's, he'd \"whack the old plate\" in front of you - then run outside for a wet sponge fight with his nephews. At Antonio Carluccio's there would be four generations round the table, which is fine in theory, but would mean your sleeve would be constantly plucked by an old lady in black telling you what a good boy Antonio was. Clarissa Dickson-Wright would have eaten it all before you were even served. The worst would be a Masterchef dinner with Loyd Grossman. \"En neow, filo parcels of salmon and foie gras, enriched with a coulis of raspberry and Pernod...\" You'd spend the whole meal running outside to throw up. \u0095 \"Hanoi Jane\" Fonda has got religion, and now attends a black church in Atlanta. I'm always puzzled that when somebody switches from one absurd, extreme and unworkable set of beliefs to another - consider the likes of Paul Johnson, Peter Hitchens and Sir Alfred Sherman - the rest of us are supposed to sit back and applaud their choice. Frankly I'm as moved as I would be if a football maniac solemnly told me he had changed his allegiance from West Ham to Millwall. My theory about football violence, for what it's worth, is that it's the inevitable result of the game being so dull. Oh I know people hammer on about \"the beautiful game\" but it's actually rather dreary. This is because, unlike American football or rugby, the players have to get the ball to one end without using the most obvious means, their hands and arms. Thus handicapped, they can offer all the excitement of a three-legged race. There's skill all right, but there is in card tricks, and they get boring after 10 minutes too. The result is that a football match can only be enjoyed if you care deeply about the result. Nobody could conceivably watch, say, Derby v Southampton, with any pleasure if the outcome didn't matter to them. Rabid partisanship is the only point. I remember going to watch the Cleveland Indians play the New York Yankees, who, having the best historical track record and being the most hated team, are the Man U of baseball. The Yankees won, but the fans trooped out into downtown Cleveland cheerfully looking for beer and pizza. This was because it had been an excellent and exciting game, enjoyed even by a uninvolved onlooker like me. \u0095 But yobbery is now engrained in our national life. Last Saturday, I was walking round Twickenham (there was no rugby on) and a group of eight young men had been getting tanked up ready for the match in the evening. They marched down the street, half of them bare-chested, chanting, shouting at women, and, on arriving at a beauty salon, wobbling their bellies up against the glass. Nothing they did was illegal, but everything was anti-social. Of course nobody even looked surprised; this kind of thing is just part of the street furniture in modern Britain, like bus stops and Boots. On Wednesday I was waiting at Waterloo for a train which was just back from Ascot. Some of the racegoers were drunk, even the ones with those class-identifying cardboard tags, and some were singing. The train they'd just left was filthy, a mass of racing pages, drinks cans and junk. The trouble is that we don't have a language to say we're annoyed and offended by this without sounding like a Daily Mail reader who dim-wittedly blames it all on Roy Jenkins and Shirley Williams. \u0095 Mind you, football commentators still provide the fun so obviously lacking in the game. It's because they live in such a closed, football-intensive world, that they can't hear what they're saying or put it in a wider context. Which is why, when I switched on at the end of the France v Holland, match and a substitution was taking place, I heard the commentator say excitedly: \"Winter now has a record number of Dutch caps!\" \u0095 Watching Amis On Amis on ITV this week, I heard again Kingsley's famous plea for honest advertising: \"Bowen's Beer - it makes you drunk.\" But all advertising has a message, often as direct. The Wonderbra ads - \"Hello boys\"; \"Mind if I bring two friends?\" - openly said: \"If you wear this, men will think you're available.\" Then next day I stood on the southbound Victoria line platform at Oxford Circus, and saw 18 huge posters of Anna Kournikova, advertising a sports bra. These gigantic identical women, stretching the length of the platform, make an almost overwhelming sight. Yet the iconography is completely different from the Wonderbra poster. Ms Kournikova, who has a pleasant smile, is scowling here, and her hand rests aggressively on her hip. The bra itself is all straps and strengthening, so it looks like a strait jacket. The slogan, \"Only the ball should bounce\" means two things: to women, it says, \"Protect your breast tissue from damage.\" To men it says, \"Watch the tennis, not my body.\" In short, it's advertising the player's non-availability. The direct, Amis-like message is: \"Wear this bra and you won't have any trouble, either from stretched ligaments or men.\" Whether this indicates a social change, or it's just some ad-man's clever wheeze, I have no way of knowing. \u0095 After two and a half years' investigation, the successful \"zero tolerance\" Middlesborough detective, Ray Mallon, has been cleared. I met him once, at a lunch in London, shortly before he was taken off duty. I was hugely impressed, not least with his clear-eyed and sceptical view of the police.

It seems his lucky break was having a father, Homer (of course) Groening, who made animated films and trashy surfer movies. </p> <p>Matt Groening doesn't give many interviews, maybe because he's shrewd enough to recognise that while the Simpsons phenomenon is fascinating, he isn't. Perhaps he also senses that viewers might see through his absurd claim that he has always been just a humble animator with no ambition. \"I love cartooning and I love writing, and luckily I get to do it and get paid for it,\" he announced, barely able to stop himself wringing his hands in an orgy of bogus self-effacement. With guileless unmotivation on this scale, it won't be long before he accidentally ends up controlling American foreign policy from the Oval Office. </p> <p>I was fortunate enough to miss the first series of Heartburn Hotel (BBC1), and having watched last night's episode, I'll make a point of missing the second series too.

      "body": "<p>No one, for some reason, has ever been able to remember the title of my novel Towards The End Of the Morning. By the common consent of almost everyone who has mentioned it to me since it was first published in 1967, it seems to have been rechristened Your Fleet Street Novel. What surprises me a little is that anyone can still remember what the phrase Fleet Street once signified. </p> <p>Fleet Street now is just the dull, busy thoroughfare that connects the City to the West End. When I first arrived to work in it, in the last few months of the 50s, it was synonymous with the newspaper industry. It referred not just to the street itself, but to the whole close-packed district around it - to a way of life with its own style and philosophy; a world that has now vanished as completely as the Fleet Ditch that gave the street its name. (The notoriously foul stream was incorporated by Bazalgette into the sewerage system, and concealed in a culvert that runs beneath Ludgate Circus, at the eastern end of the street; certain parallels with the newspaper industry, however, continued to be visible to its critics.) </p> <p>It even had its own characteristic smell. Just as Southwark, where my father worked, on the other side of the river, was immediately identifiable by the delicately sour smell of the Kentish hops that were warehoused and factored there, so the alleys and courts of Fleet Street were haunted by the grey, serious smell of newsprint. I catch the delicious ghost of it in my nostrils now, and at once I'm back at the beginning of my career, struggling to conceal my awe and excitement at having at last arrived in this longed-for land. </p> <p>By that time, actually, Fleet Street was coming towards the end not just of the morning, but of the afternoon as well, and the shades of night were gathering fast. On the street itself there were only two real newspaper offices left: the modernistic black glass box from which the Daily and Sunday Express improbably dispensed their archaic patriotics, and the white imperial slab of the Telegraph, looking more appropriately like the Tomb of the Unknown Leader-Writer. The London offices of various provincial and foreign papers maintained Fleet Street addresses in cramped rooms up staircases above tobacconists' shops - the Manchester Guardian, where I worked, had a few rooms over the post office at the Temple Bar end of the street. </p> <p>The real life, though, was in the narrow lanes just off the street, in Fetter Lane and Shoe Lane to the north, and Whitefriars Street and Bouverie Street to the south - in the grimy, exhausted-looking offices of the Mail and the Mirror, the News of the World, the Evening News and the Evening Standard. The Observer, to which I moved in 1962, occupied a muddled warren down in Tudor Street. </p> <p>Other papers had ventured a little further, though they all remained in pubbable range - the Times at Blackfriars, the Financial Times up the hill by St Paul's, the Sunday Times and Sunday Pictorial a bleak half-mile away in Gray's Inn Road. The Sun and the Independent were still undreamed of, and the appearance of anything new in this run-down world seemed as unlikely as the birth of a baby in an old folk's home. Even when the Daily Telegraph did manage to give birth to the Sunday Telegraph in 1961, the new infant had a suitably grey and elderly air. </p> <p>A few terminal cases were still coughing their last in odd corners. The Daily Herald up in Endell Street, being slowly suffocated by its affiliation to the TUC; down in Bouverie Street the poor old News Chronicle, the decent Liberal paper that everyone liked but no one read, and on which I had been brought up, kept going by its rather more successful little brother, the Evening Star. On the masthead of the Chronicle lingered the titles of a whole succession of defunct and forgotten papers that had been interred in it over the years, like the overgrown names of the departed accumulating on a family mausoleum: the Daily News, the Daily Chronicle, the Daily Dispatch, the Westminster Gazette, the Morning Leader. I'd scarcely been there a year when the whole vault finally collapsed, taking the Star and all the old names with it. </p> <p>All the same, the forests of the sub-arctic north were still being steadily digested each day through this tangled alimentary canal. Great cylinders of newsprint went swinging above your head from the articulated lorries blocking every side-street. Through grimy pavement-level skylights here and there you could glimpse the web racing on the huge machines thundering in the basements. In every loading-bay there loitered underemployed gangs left over from some earlier industrial age, waiting to pass the product out, bale by bale, hand to hand, like sacks of grain from a medieval mill, to the the vans that raced the more and more clamorously titled Late Extras and Late Finals of the evenings to the street-corner vendors, then the Irish and country editions of the dailies to the main-line stations. And, wafting from every bay and ventilator and seedy lobby, that intoxicating scent. </p> <p>Mingling with it was another characteristic smell - the warm beery breath from doorways with titles above them as familiar as the mastheads on the papers themselves. The Mucky Duck, aka White Swan, where the Chronicle and I think the Mail drank; the Printer's Devil, favoured by the Mirror; the King and Keys, in Fleet Street itself, that refreshed the Telegraph opposite. I was passing the King and Keys one day when I was almost killed by a projectile emerging from it like a shell from a howitzer. It was a man being ejected by unseen hands, in a high trajectory that took him clear above the pavement and into the gutter beyond; whoever it was, somebody evidently felt quite strongly that it was time for him to be on his way back to the office. </p> <p> From the windows of the Guardian on another occasion I watched a very large and distinguished journalist slowly emerge from Piele's, the pub opposite, totter a few dignified steps, then abruptly sit down on the pavement, where he remained, with a surprised but resigned look on his face, plainly not the shape of person to be able to get to his feet again unaided, until the news got back to Piele's, and a team of rescue workers came straggling out to hoist him up and carry him back inside again for medication. </p> <p>The Observer drank in Auntie's, though I've forgotten whether it had any other name, and even who Auntie was. The Guardian had a foot in two camps. One was the Clachan, a rather undistinguished Younger's house grimly decorated with samples of the different tartans, where we drank our best bitter watched by a mysterious official of one of the print unions, who sat on his own at a corner of the bar every day from opening to closing time, wearing dark glasses and referred to in respectful whispers, but speaking to no one, apparently paid by either union or management just to sit there and drink all day. </p> <p>The other was El Vino's (always so-called, with an apostrophe s, like Piele's or Auntie's, as if it had a landlord called Elmer Vino). This was quite different - not a pub at all, but a wine-bar before wine-bars had been invented, where we drank not bitter but Chablis-and-soda, alongside not trade-unionists but florid Rumpoles from the Temple and the sort of fellow-journalists who had pretensions to be members of a learned profession themselves - ruined scholars who could review you at short notice a book about Lord Northcliffe or Hugh Kingsmill, or knock you out a belligerently authoritative think-piece on the proper constitutional relationship between Crown and Woolsack. Women were strongly discouraged from entering.

      "bodyText": "No one, for some reason, has ever been able to remember the title of my novel Towards The End Of the Morning. By the common consent of almost everyone who has mentioned it to me since it was first published in 1967, it seems to have been rechristened Your Fleet Street Novel. What surprises me a little is that anyone can still remember what the phrase Fleet Street once signified. Fleet Street now is just the dull, busy thoroughfare that connects the City to the West End. When I first arrived to work in it, in the last few months of the 50s, it was synonymous with the newspaper industry. It referred not just to the street itself, but to the whole close-packed district around it - to a way of life with its own style and philosophy; a world that has now vanished as completely as the Fleet Ditch that gave the street its name. (The notoriously foul stream was incorporated by Bazalgette into the sewerage system, and concealed in a culvert that runs beneath Ludgate Circus, at the eastern end of the street; certain parallels with the newspaper industry, however, continued to be visible to its critics.) It even had its own characteristic smell. Just as Southwark, where my father worked, on the other side of the river, was immediately identifiable by the delicately sour smell of the Kentish hops that were warehoused and factored there, so the alleys and courts of Fleet Street were haunted by the grey, serious smell of newsprint. I catch the delicious ghost of it in my nostrils now, and at once I'm back at the beginning of my career, struggling to conceal my awe and excitement at having at last arrived in this longed-for land. By that time, actually, Fleet Street was coming towards the end not just of the morning, but of the afternoon as well, and the shades of night were gathering fast. On the street itself there were only two real newspaper offices left: the modernistic black glass box from which the Daily and Sunday Express improbably dispensed their archaic patriotics, and the white imperial slab of the Telegraph, looking more appropriately like the Tomb of the Unknown Leader-Writer. The London offices of various provincial and foreign papers maintained Fleet Street addresses in cramped rooms up staircases above tobacconists' shops - the Manchester Guardian, where I worked, had a few rooms over the post office at the Temple Bar end of the street. The real life, though, was in the narrow lanes just off the street, in Fetter Lane and Shoe Lane to the north, and Whitefriars Street and Bouverie Street to the south - in the grimy, exhausted-looking offices of the Mail and the Mirror, the News of the World, the Evening News and the Evening Standard. The Observer, to which I moved in 1962, occupied a muddled warren down in Tudor Street. Other papers had ventured a little further, though they all remained in pubbable range - the Times at Blackfriars, the Financial Times up the hill by St Paul's, the Sunday Times and Sunday Pictorial a bleak half-mile away in Gray's Inn Road. The Sun and the Independent were still undreamed of, and the appearance of anything new in this run-down world seemed as unlikely as the birth of a baby in an old folk's home. Even when the Daily Telegraph did manage to give birth to the Sunday Telegraph in 1961, the new infant had a suitably grey and elderly air. A few terminal cases were still coughing their last in odd corners. The Daily Herald up in Endell Street, being slowly suffocated by its affiliation to the TUC; down in Bouverie Street the poor old News Chronicle, the decent Liberal paper that everyone liked but no one read, and on which I had been brought up, kept going by its rather more successful little brother, the Evening Star. On the masthead of the Chronicle lingered the titles of a whole succession of defunct and forgotten papers that had been interred in it over the years, like the overgrown names of the departed accumulating on a family mausoleum: the Daily News, the Daily Chronicle, the Daily Dispatch, the Westminster Gazette, the Morning Leader. I'd scarcely been there a year when the whole vault finally collapsed, taking the Star and all the old names with it. All the same, the forests of the sub-arctic north were still being steadily digested each day through this tangled alimentary canal. Great cylinders of newsprint went swinging above your head from the articulated lorries blocking every side-street. Through grimy pavement-level skylights here and there you could glimpse the web racing on the huge machines thundering in the basements. In every loading-bay there loitered underemployed gangs left over from some earlier industrial age, waiting to pass the product out, bale by bale, hand to hand, like sacks of grain from a medieval mill, to the the vans that raced the more and more clamorously titled Late Extras and Late Finals of the evenings to the street-corner vendors, then the Irish and country editions of the dailies to the main-line stations. And, wafting from every bay and ventilator and seedy lobby, that intoxicating scent. Mingling with it was another characteristic smell - the warm beery breath from doorways with titles above them as familiar as the mastheads on the papers themselves. The Mucky Duck, aka White Swan, where the Chronicle and I think the Mail drank; the Printer's Devil, favoured by the Mirror; the King and Keys, in Fleet Street itself, that refreshed the Telegraph opposite. I was passing the King and Keys one day when I was almost killed by a projectile emerging from it like a shell from a howitzer. It was a man being ejected by unseen hands, in a high trajectory that took him clear above the pavement and into the gutter beyond; whoever it was, somebody evidently felt quite strongly that it was time for him to be on his way back to the office. From the windows of the Guardian on another occasion I watched a very large and distinguished journalist slowly emerge from Piele's, the pub opposite, totter a few dignified steps, then abruptly sit down on the pavement, where he remained, with a surprised but resigned look on his face, plainly not the shape of person to be able to get to his feet again unaided, until the news got back to Piele's, and a team of rescue workers came straggling out to hoist him up and carry him back inside again for medication. The Observer drank in Auntie's, though I've forgotten whether it had any other name, and even who Auntie was. The Guardian had a foot in two camps. One was the Clachan, a rather undistinguished Younger's house grimly decorated with samples of the different tartans, where we drank our best bitter watched by a mysterious official of one of the print unions, who sat on his own at a corner of the bar every day from opening to closing time, wearing dark glasses and referred to in respectful whispers, but speaking to no one, apparently paid by either union or management just to sit there and drink all day. The other was El Vino's (always so-called, with an apostrophe s, like Piele's or Auntie's, as if it had a landlord called Elmer Vino). This was quite different - not a pub at all, but a wine-bar before wine-bars had been invented, where we drank not bitter but Chablis-and-soda, alongside not trade-unionists but florid Rumpoles from the Temple and the sort of fellow-journalists who had pretensions to be members of a learned profession themselves - ruined scholars who could review you at short notice a book about Lord Northcliffe or Hugh Kingsmill, or knock you out a belligerently authoritative think-piece on the proper constitutional relationship between Crown and Woolsack. Women were strongly discouraged from entering. Any woman who insisted was not allowed to disturb the collegiate atmosphere of the bar itself but was directed to a room at the back furnished with chairs and tables, where Elmer's grand head-waiter would ritually shame her by forcing one of the more elderly and infirm old soaks taking refuge there to give up his seat to her. There was something symbolic about our alternation between these two different establishments. On the one hand we were simple craftsmen and trade-unionists; on the other we had certain social aspirations. I was a member of the National Union of Journalists, certainly, but my only contact with it by the time I had moved to the Observer, apart from paying my dues, was an occasional plaintive note from the Branch Secretary asking why we had no union chapel at the office. I would pass the queries on to colleagues who knew more than I did about the paper's rather idiosyncratic workings, and back the same answer would always come: we didn't need a chapel because we were all, staff and management alike, gentlemen together. We mostly worked at a rather gentlemanly pace by the standards of today's journalists. We didn't have quite such a limitless acreage of newsprint to fill, and we hadn't yet got bogged down in the endless union negotiations that darkened the last days of Fleet Street, before Rupert Murdoch side-stepped them, and in 1986 broke out of that increasingly hobbled and embittered little world to the brutal simplicities of Wapping. Now the rest of the newspaper industry has followed Murdoch's lead, and scattered across London - to the Isle of Dogs and Clerkenwell (where my two former employers have taken refuge under the same roof at last), to Old Street and Kensington High Street; even, at one point, to South London and Heathrow.

One shows him with his mother Ida, her maternal smile revealing classically bad Victorian teeth. In the second portrait, the infant Eric is being held by a strikingly dark Indian nanny, whose identity is lost. She regards the camera with a penetrating stare. In the background, you can make out the outline of a neat colonial bungalow. There are flowerpots; a path leads tantalisingly backwards; the grass is fresh and lush. </p> <p>That the pudgy baby was to metamorphose into the cadaverous George Orwell is well known. Less well known, though, is what happened to the bungalow in which Eric was born, and the fate of Motihari, the obscure Indian town where he spent the first year of his life. </p> <p>Several months ago an intriguing rumour reached me: George Orwell's birthplace had become a cowshed. This seemed exquisitely appropriate for the writer and fabulist who found fame at the end of his life with Animal Farm. </p> <p>When I visited Motihari nearly 100 years after his birth, it emerged that few people had heard of George Orwell. This is not surprising. Few people in Motihari can read; of those, even fewer can read English. Could one buy Orwell's books in Motihari? \"Not available,\" one resident said. </p> <p>When the Blairs arrived here early last century, Motihari was little more than an overgrown village, \"pleasantly situated,\" as a contemporary guidebook puts it, \"on the east bank of a lake.\" The town, population 13,730, functioned as an administrative headquarters for northern Bengal. It boasted a jail, \"the usual public offices\", a school, and a troop of light horse. </p> <p>Orwell's father, Richard Walmesley Blair, was posted here as a member of a now vanished imperial tribe. He was a sub-deputy opium agent. Opium had been licensed as a government monopoly in 1860. Though its production aroused controversy at home, opium provided an enormous source of revenue for the British empire, and had the added advantage of enfeebling the Chinese. </p> <p>The son of a vicar, Richard joined the lowly opium service at the age of 18. In the course of his unremarkable career, he found himself posted to some of the remotest corners of British India, often shifting posts every year. By the time he arrived in Motihari, Blair was 46. His wife Ida, the daughter of a teak merchant who had grown up in Burma, was 18 years his junior. </p> <p>Orwell was to regard his father as a remote and ancient figure; his father in turn found his son's literary obsessions baffling. His mother Ida was brighter, less conventional, more artistic. Eric's older sister Marjorie was also born in India, in 1898. His younger sister Avril was conceived after Ida, Eric and Marjorie returned to Henley in 1904. </p> <p>Motihari now is a chaotic, mud-infested town of 150,000. It has rickshaws, lychee sellers, potholes, itinerant farm animals and small shops. There are few cars; no one can afford them. Motihari is so far off the beaten track that its most expensive hotel, the Raj, costs \u00a34 a night (cockroaches gratis). \"We were reluctant to fit air-conditioners in our house in case the local goons turned up demanding money,\" one member of Motihari's small middle class confessed. The political and criminal classes here have been conflated. </p> <p>In the end, finding Eric's bungalow was easy. Or so it seemed. The Blairs had lived at the far end of town, in a European quarter known as Miscourt (probably a corruption of \"mess\" and \"court\"). They occupied one of three colonial bungalows looking out onto an open field. We parked at the bottom of a muddy lane and tramped through a brick archway. The field was still there, as were the bungalows, now painted blue. What was not clear, however, was which one had been Eric's. An earthquake had flattened Motihari in 1934; the small brick houses may have been damaged and substantially rebuilt. It was evident, though, that Ida and Richard's home had been modest. </p> <p>I asked Mrs Prabha Prasad, who lived next door to the bungalows, whether she had heard of George Orwell. \"No,\" she replied, slightly defensively. Several other women nodded agreement. </p> <p>A group of hairy pigs rooted around in a mud pond next to some banana trees. A donkey wandered by. Three small boys flew homemade kites, while an old man sheltered from the sun under a black umbrella. There was no sign of any cows. </p> <p>One of the bungalows was occupied by an English teacher, Braj Nandai Rai. This seemed promising. But Mr Rai had not heard of Orwell either. He had heard of Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw, both of whom Orwell admired. \"I am fond of Macbeth, Merchant of Venice and As You Like,\" he said. </p> <p>Eric Blair's birthplace, it transpired, was almost, but not quite, a cowshed. A vast warehouse opposite the bungalows still stands. It was built by the British to store opium and indigo, the crop that poor Indian farmers were compelled to grow by their colonial overlords. Richard Blair had lived next door to, rather than above the shop, it seemed. Once the British left, the warehouse had been turned into a cowshed - hence the tantalising rumour - and now served as a teachers' hostel. \"George Orwell was the son of the opium agent,\" one man said, gesturing definitively at the earthquake-cracked warehouse. </p> <p>A few of Motihari's elderly residents had memories of the British, though none was able to identify Eric's lost nanny. RK Verma, a 79-year-old advocate who still serves at Motihari's court, remembered Orwell being discussed in literary circles. \"I wanted to read his novels but I could not find them,\" he said. \"The literature he gave is liked by many. I liked Keats, Shelley and Wordsworth. They were great poets.\" His main memory, though, is of British savagery. \"The planters used to force farmers, including my father, to grow indigo plants. Those who refused were beaten, their land confiscated.\" </p> <p>Bishwanath Prasad, an 80-year-old poet, also recalled the \"well-dressed\" British riding around Motihari on horses, or playing tennis. \"I used to buy old tennis balls from them. We paid six to eight annas per ball. We played football with them.\" But contact between the natives and the English was limited. \"There was a distinction between the ruler and the ruled. So naturally no friendship grew between us.\" </p> <p>These days it is hard to find any traces of colonial rule in Motihari. Even the dead are disappearing. The English cemetery, once in the middle of a green field, is now encircled by houses. Several of the tombstones are used by local women as washing slabs. Goats dart in and out of the high weeds that have almost enveloped the few remaining graves. One of them is sacred to the memory of Annie Elizabeth, who died in 1861, aged 32. She was the wife of James Cosserat, \"sub-deputy opium agent of Mooteeharee\": Richard Blair's predecessor by four decades. </p> <p>Over at the English church, it was the same story of decline. It became clear that the congregation had fallen away well before 1947. A solitary tablet recorded the now-forgotten tragedy of the Rev and Mrs SW Law, whose children Jean and Ronald died in quick succession in 1931 and 1934. The Blairs may or may not have come here with Marjorie and Eric to worship, walking past the lake and the district magistrate's bungalow. No parish records survive. </p> <p>The monsoon-sodden colonial records relating to the period still exist; they can be found in the district magistrate's office on the outskirts of town. But a quick perusal revealed no trace of Richard Walmesley Blair. This was hardly surprising. He was too obscure, too unambitious, too junior to have made any indentation on official history. </p> <p>There was some information about his job, though. LSS O'Malley, in his 1907 chronicle of Bengal, describes 1903 as a \"thoroughly favourable year\" for opium production. He also tells us something of the duties of a sub-deputy opium agent, an important part of which was \"supervising the weighments of opium in April, May and June\". In the earlier parts of the year, an opium agent had to travel round the district, giving advances to the poppy farmers, and taking thumbprints; later, he would return to check on the quality of the crop. The job was clearly dull and repetitious. </p> <p>The archives also shed some light on the Blairs' precarious finances. Orwell was to describe his family \"lower-upper-middle-class\", or upper class down on its luck. Money worries, and at times extreme poverty, were to dog him throughout his career. A 1906 volume, The Administration of Bengal, concedes that opium agents in the region were \"underpaid and generally discontented\". Was this true of Richard Blair? Due to a \"serious block of promotion\", officers with long periods of service \"found their emoluments stationary\", it adds. The worm-eaten records reveal that as Ida, Marjorie and Eric set sail for England in 1904, Mr Blair's salary was raised from 600 to 900 rupees a year. Apart from a three-month holiday, Eric would not see his father again until he was eight. </p> <p>At the end of my stay in Motihari, I finally discovered someone who had read George Orwell's books. Firoz Mohammed, a poet and reader in Urdu, had enjoyed both Animal Farm and 1984. \"I think he was a great writer. I appreciate his inventive powers and his objectivity; his feel for society, politics and human weakness,\" he said. \"His writing reminds me of Swift's Gulliver's Travels. I think every generation will read Orwell - every generation interested in literature and politics.\" Mohammed said his father had been a lawyer who, unusually, had fraternised with the British. \"He was a humanitarian. He liked everybody,\" he said. Vijay Singh, a local journalist with the Hindustan Times, disagreed with Mohammed's opinion of Orwell. \"People here are not interested in abstract books,\" he said, not unkindly. </p> <p> Orwell never returned to India, though he almost did so on two occasions. His application in 1921 to join the Imperial Indian Police could have taken him back to Bengal; instead he ended up in Burma. Sixteen years later he contemplated taking up a job as leader writer on a paper in Lucknow. In the event, medical advice and suspicion in the India Office of Orwell's pro-Congress sympathies intervened. </p> <p>Richard Blair died just before the outbreak of the second world war, apparently reconciled to his son's writing career. Ida passed away in 1943. Seven years later, at the height of his powers, Orwell too was dead. </p> <p>As I waited on the platform of Motihari station, I wondered what had happened to Eric's nanny. She had played an unwitting cameo role in Orwell's life, and now all trace of her had vanished. The closest I came to identifying her was when one old Motiharian remarked: \"She looks like the girls from round here.\" </p> <p>Compared to the ruinous present, though, such thoughts seemed self-indulgent. Next to me on the platform, two women lay in the filth with two children. All four of them looked more dead than alive. They woke up. The children were fed a scrap of bread, and then set about begging. Orwell, no doubt, would have had something to say. We are in need of him now more than ever.</p>",

When the Blairs arrived here early last century, Motihari was little more than an overgrown village, \"pleasantly situated,\" as a contemporary guidebook puts it, \"on the east bank of a lake.\" The town, population 13,730, functioned as an administrative headquarters for northern Bengal. It boasted a jail, \"the usual public offices\", a school, and a troop of light horse. Orwell's father, Richard Walmesley Blair, was posted here as a member of a now vanished imperial tribe. He was a sub-deputy opium agent. Opium had been licensed as a government monopoly in 1860. Though its production aroused controversy at home, opium provided an enormous source of revenue for the British empire, and had the added advantage of enfeebling the Chinese. The son of a vicar, Richard joined the lowly opium service at the age of 18. In the course of his unremarkable career, he found himself posted to some of the remotest corners of British India, often shifting posts every year. By the time he arrived in Motihari, Blair was 46. His wife Ida, the daughter of a teak merchant who had grown up in Burma, was 18 years his junior. Orwell was to regard his father as a remote and ancient figure; his father in turn found his son's literary obsessions baffling. His mother Ida was brighter, less conventional, more artistic. Eric's older sister Marjorie was also born in India, in 1898. His younger sister Avril was conceived after Ida, Eric and Marjorie returned to Henley in 1904. Motihari now is a chaotic, mud-infested town of 150,000. It has rickshaws, lychee sellers, potholes, itinerant farm animals and small shops. There are few cars; no one can afford them. Motihari is so far off the beaten track that its most expensive hotel, the Raj, costs \u00a34 a night (cockroaches gratis). \"We were reluctant to fit air-conditioners in our house in case the local goons turned up demanding money,\" one member of Motihari's small middle class confessed. The political and criminal classes here have been conflated. In the end, finding Eric's bungalow was easy. Or so it seemed. The Blairs had lived at the far end of town, in a European quarter known as Miscourt (probably a corruption of \"mess\" and \"court\"). They occupied one of three colonial bungalows looking out onto an open field. We parked at the bottom of a muddy lane and tramped through a brick archway. The field was still there, as were the bungalows, now painted blue. What was not clear, however, was which one had been Eric's. An earthquake had flattened Motihari in 1934; the small brick houses may have been damaged and substantially rebuilt. It was evident, though, that Ida and Richard's home had been modest. I asked Mrs Prabha Prasad, who lived next door to the bungalows, whether she had heard of George Orwell. \"No,\" she replied, slightly defensively. Several other women nodded agreement. A group of hairy pigs rooted around in a mud pond next to some banana trees. A donkey wandered by. Three small boys flew homemade kites, while an old man sheltered from the sun under a black umbrella. There was no sign of any cows. One of the bungalows was occupied by an English teacher, Braj Nandai Rai. This seemed promising. But Mr Rai had not heard of Orwell either. He had heard of Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw, both of whom Orwell admired. \"I am fond of Macbeth, Merchant of Venice and As You Like,\" he said. Eric Blair's birthplace, it transpired, was almost, but not quite, a cowshed. A vast warehouse opposite the bungalows still stands. It was built by the British to store opium and indigo, the crop that poor Indian farmers were compelled to grow by their colonial overlords. Richard Blair had lived next door to, rather than above the shop, it seemed. Once the British left, the warehouse had been turned into a cowshed - hence the tantalising rumour - and now served as a teachers' hostel. \"George Orwell was the son of the opium agent,\" one man said, gesturing definitively at the earthquake-cracked warehouse. A few of Motihari's elderly residents had memories of the British, though none was able to identify Eric's lost nanny. RK Verma, a 79-year-old advocate who still serves at Motihari's court, remembered Orwell being discussed in literary circles. \"I wanted to read his novels but I could not find them,\" he said. \"The literature he gave is liked by many. I liked Keats, Shelley and Wordsworth. They were great poets.\" His main memory, though, is of British savagery. \"The planters used to force farmers, including my father, to grow indigo plants. Those who refused were beaten, their land confiscated.\" Bishwanath Prasad, an 80-year-old poet, also recalled the \"well-dressed\" British riding around Motihari on horses, or playing tennis. \"I used to buy old tennis balls from them. We paid six to eight annas per ball. We played football with them.\" But contact between the natives and the English was limited. \"There was a distinction between the ruler and the ruled. So naturally no friendship grew between us.\" These days it is hard to find any traces of colonial rule in Motihari. Even the dead are disappearing. The English cemetery, once in the middle of a green field, is now encircled by houses. Several of the tombstones are used by local women as washing slabs. Goats dart in and out of the high weeds that have almost enveloped the few remaining graves. One of them is sacred to the memory of Annie Elizabeth, who died in 1861, aged 32. She was the wife of James Cosserat, \"sub-deputy opium agent of Mooteeharee\": Richard Blair's predecessor by four decades. Over at the English church, it was the same story of decline. It became clear that the congregation had fallen away well before 1947. A solitary tablet recorded the now-forgotten tragedy of the Rev and Mrs SW Law, whose children Jean and Ronald died in quick succession in 1931 and 1934. The Blairs may or may not have come here with Marjorie and Eric to worship, walking past the lake and the district magistrate's bungalow. No parish records survive. The monsoon-sodden colonial records relating to the period still exist; they can be found in the district magistrate's office on the outskirts of town. But a quick perusal revealed no trace of Richard Walmesley Blair. This was hardly surprising. He was too obscure, too unambitious, too junior to have made any indentation on official history. There was some information about his job, though. LSS O'Malley, in his 1907 chronicle of Bengal, describes 1903 as a \"thoroughly favourable year\" for opium production. He also tells us something of the duties of a sub-deputy opium agent, an important part of which was \"supervising the weighments of opium in April, May and June\". In the earlier parts of the year, an opium agent had to travel round the district, giving advances to the poppy farmers, and taking thumbprints; later, he would return to check on the quality of the crop. The job was clearly dull and repetitious. The archives also shed some light on the Blairs' precarious finances. Orwell was to describe his family \"lower-upper-middle-class\", or upper class down on its luck. Money worries, and at times extreme poverty, were to dog him throughout his career. A 1906 volume, The Administration of Bengal, concedes that opium agents in the region were \"underpaid and generally discontented\". Was this true of Richard Blair? Due to a \"serious block of promotion\", officers with long periods of service \"found their emoluments stationary\", it adds. The worm-eaten records reveal that as Ida, Marjorie and Eric set sail for England in 1904, Mr Blair's salary was raised from 600 to 900 rupees a year. Apart from a three-month holiday, Eric would not see his father again until he was eight. At the end of my stay in Motihari, I finally discovered someone who had read George Orwell's books. Firoz Mohammed, a poet and reader in Urdu, had enjoyed both Animal Farm and 1984. \"I think he was a great writer. I appreciate his inventive powers and his objectivity; his feel for society, politics and human weakness,\" he said. \"His writing reminds me of Swift's Gulliver's Travels. I think every generation will read Orwell - every generation interested in literature and politics.\" Mohammed said his father had been a lawyer who, unusually, had fraternised with the British. \"He was a humanitarian. He liked everybody,\" he said. Vijay Singh, a local journalist with the Hindustan Times, disagreed with Mohammed's opinion of Orwell. \"People here are not interested in abstract books,\" he said, not unkindly. Orwell never returned to India, though he almost did so on two occasions. His application in 1921 to join the Imperial Indian Police could have taken him back to Bengal; instead he ended up in Burma. Sixteen years later he contemplated taking up a job as leader writer on a paper in Lucknow. In the event, medical advice and suspicion in the India Office of Orwell's pro-Congress sympathies intervened. Richard Blair died just before the outbreak of the second world war, apparently reconciled to his son's writing career. Ida passed away in 1943. Seven years later, at the height of his powers, Orwell too was dead. As I waited on the platform of Motihari station, I wondered what had happened to Eric's nanny. She had played an unwitting cameo role in Orwell's life, and now all trace of her had vanished. The closest I came to identifying her was when one old Motiharian remarked: \"She looks like the girls from round here.\" Compared to the ruinous present, though, such thoughts seemed self-indulgent. Next to me on the platform, two women lay in the filth with two children. All four of them looked more dead than alive. They woke up. The children were fed a scrap of bread, and then set about begging. Orwell, no doubt, would have had something to say. We are in need of him now more than ever.",

Few things are better for the soul than a tasty meal. And if the ingredients just happen to fix the body as well, then who's complaining?</p> <p>All recipes serve four.</p> <p><b>Guinea Fowl with elderflower</b></p> <p>The elderflower season is so short that it's a good idea to find as many uses for them as possible - not least as they are reputed to calm the nerves. <b> 8 heads elderflower</b></p> <p><b>1 lemon</b></p> <p><b>1 guinea fowl, approx 1.5kg</b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp sunflower oil</b></p> <p><b>2 onions</b></p> <p><b>1 leek</b></p> <p><b>5 sticks celery</b></p> <p><b>3 carrots</b></p> <p><b>500ml chicken stock</b></p> <p><b>400ml elderflower p\u00e9tillante (or 350ml white wine, plus 50ml water and 2 tbsp elderflower cordial) 1 bayleaf </b></p> <p>Pick the elderflowers as near to the time of using them as possible (and preferably not from beside a roaring main road, both for your own safety and for the fact that they may have a good dose of eau de traffic). Once picked, give the flowers a very hearty shake, to expel any lurking bugs and any mature, dry blooms, then wash in cold water and leave to drip dry.</p> <p>Meanwhile, wash the lemon, if it is waxy, cut it in half and place one half inside the cavity of the bird, followed by all but one of the elderflower heads. Heat the oil in a deep, heavy pan, season the bird, then brown all over in the oil and remove. Roughly chop all the vegetables, and saut\u00e9 them in the same pan as the guinea fowl. Season well, pour in the stock, then lay the bird on the bed of vegetables, add the elderflower p\u00e9tillante and bayleaf, and bring to a simmer.</p> <p>Turn the heat right down and leave the fowl to poach gently for about 45 minutes, or until its juices run clear when pierced with a skewer. Leave to rest while you make the sauce. Strain off the cooking liquid and reserve. Lift out the bayleaf and whizz the cooked vegetables in a processor. Gradually add the strained liquor as the mixture begins to resemble a pur\u00e9e, adding as much as you need to achieve a sauce-like consistency (I like quite a thin sauce, so use all the cooking liquor and, perhaps, a couple of tablespoons of hot water as well).</p> <p>Joint the fowl, and serve with a good ladleful of sauce and a scattering of elderflowers from the reserved head.</p> <p><b>Lamb with watercress in pastry</b></p> <p>The inspiration for this came from lamb wrapped in vine leaves and pastry, made by Joyce Molyneux at the Carved Angel, Dartmouth. Watercress is a bracing and peppery herb, considered by herbalists to be good for rheumatic pains and bronchitis. These can be prepared well in advance, and cooked just before serving.</p> <p>For the pastry</p> <p><b>275g plain flour</b></p> <p><b>1 pinch salt</b></p> <p><b>225g butter, cold and cut in cubes</b></p> <p><b>120ml cold water</b></p> <p><b>1 egg white, for glazing</b></p> <p>For the filling</p> <p><b>2 tbsp oil</b></p> <p><b>2 shallots, finely chopped</b></p> <p><b>2 bunches watercress, washed and chopped, thick stalks removed</b></p> <p><b>50g butter</b></p> <p><b>Sea salt and black pepper</b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp vermouth</b></p> <p><b>1kg lamb fillet, taken from the thicker end and cut into four </b></p> <p>First, make the pastry: place the dry ingredients in a food processor, add the butter, and process to the texture of fine breadcrumbs. Slowly add the chilled water to form a dough. Bring the dough together, wrap it in cling-film and leave to rest in the fridge for half-an-hour.</p> <p>Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan, and sweat the shallots. When they are soft, add the watercress, butter, seasoning and vermouth, cover and cook until the watercress has wilted a little. Remove the lid, and reduce the liquid until it clings to the leaves. Set aside to cool.</p> <p>Heat the rest of the oil in a large frying pan, and brown the meat all over. Transfer to a plate, and leave to cool.</p> <p>Cut four pieces from the pastry, and roll into 16cm x 10cm rectangles about the thickness of a 10p piece - you may want to trim it, to get straight edges. Leave to rest in a cool place (but not in the fridge - if it gets too hard, it may be difficult to work with) while you make a couple of deep slashes in each piece of meat and fill these with watercress mixture. Smear any leftover watercress over the outside of the meat. Place a piece of meat in the centre of each pastry rectangle, brush the edges with egg white and envelop the filling, seam-side down. Leave to rest until it is time to cook them, and for at least 30 minutes.</p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4, glaze the pastry parcels with egg white and cut a small cross in the top of each one. Bake for around 25 minutes, until the pastry is golden. Serve immediately with a simple green salad, and some cherry tomatoes roasted with rosemary and garlic.</p> <p><b>Roast Pork with herbs</b></p> <p>Based on an Elizabeth David recipe from French Provincial Cooking, this is delicious hot or cold.</p> <p><b>8-bone best end of pork, chined and skinned, skin reserved</b></p> <p><b>2 cloves garlic, peeled and cut into slivers</b></p> <p><b>300ml white wine</b></p> <p><b>2 onions, roughly chopped</b></p> <p><b>2 sprigs thyme</b></p> <p><b>1 bayleaf</b></p> <p><b>300ml chicken stock</b></p> <p><b>100g soft white breadcrumbs</b></p> <p><b>Grated rind of 1 lemon</b></p> <p><b>1 large handful parsley, finely chopped</b></p> <p><b>8 sage leaves, finely chopped</b></p> <p>Season the meat, and slip the slivers of garlic in among the bones. In a baking tray, place the meat fat side up on top of the skin, pour over the wine, and scatter over the onion and herbs. Leave to marinade for a few hours, basting from time to time.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Cover the meat (tin foil is best), roast for about 20 minutes, then turn down the heat to 175C/ 350F/gas mark 4. Add the chicken stock, and cook for another hour. Mix together the breadcrumbs, lemon zest, parsley and sage.</p> <p>When the hour is up, take the meat out of the oven, remove the cover, skim the fat from the cooking liquor and remove the skin underneath the meat and discard - it has done its job, which is to enrich the cooking juices. Cover the fat with the herby breadcrumbs, and press them in well (use a palette knife if you prefer not to do this by hand). Return the meat to the oven, and cook for a further 30 minutes, until the crumbs have formed a golden, herby crust.</p> <p>Place the joint on a warm serving dish to rest. Skim off the fat from the cooking juices, then taste what's left, reduce it a little, if necessary, and strain what's left into a jug, for serving with the meat. New potatoes and Savoy cabbage or curly kale go splendidly with this. If you are serving the meat cold, you probably won't want to serve the cooking juices (save them for a gravy day), and serve with a crunchy coleslaw of cabbage, carrot, fennel and spring onion to go with the steamed new potatoes.</p> <p><b>Herb and feta potato cakes with tomato, broad bean and mint salad </b></p> <p>Just about the perfect summer lunch.</p> <p><b>For the potato cakes</b></p> <p><b>2 onions, peeled and grated</b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp olive oil</b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp butter</b></p> <p><b>500g potatoes, peeled and coarsely grated</b></p> <p><b>120g plain flour</b></p> <p><b>4 eggs, beaten</b></p> <p><b>120g feta cheese</b></p> <p><b>2 heaped tbsp each mint, parsley, chives and dill </b></p> <p>For the salad</p> <p><b>500g fresh plum tomatoes</b></p> <p><b>2 spring onions</b></p> <p><b>1kg broad beans, podded, blanched and popped from their skins</b></p> <p><b>4 tbsp olive oil</b></p> <p><b>Juice of 1 lemon</b></p> <p><b>1 handful picked mint leaves</b></p> <p>Place the grated onion on a clean tea towel, fold up and squeeze as much liquid out as you can. Heat one tablespoon of oil in a large, heavy-based pan and add the butter, then saut\u00e9 the onions for a couple of minutes. Meanwhile, thoroughly squeeze the liquid from the potatoes, add to the onion mix, and stir from time to time until the mixture is golden all over. Tip into a bowl, and leave to cool for a while.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Add the flour, eggs, feta, seasoning and herbs to the potato-and-onion ensemble, and mix well. Brush a cake tin with the remaining oil, tip the mixture into the tin and bake for 20 minutes, until crisp and golden. While the potato cake is cooking, quarter the tomatoes, finely slice the spring onions and toss them with the beans, olive oil, lemon juice and seasoning.</p> <p>To serve, cut the potato cake into quarters, and rip up the mint leaves and mix them into the salad.</p> <p><b>Salmon with Montpellier butter and Jersey royals</b></p> <p>The butter is an old classic, and is crammed with herbs. Grill the fish or, even better, barbecue it.</p> <p><b>500g Jersey royals, washed</b></p> <p><b>1 sprig fresh mint</b></p> <p><b>800g salmon fillet (preferably wild)</b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp olive oil</b></p> <p><b>2 large handfuls baby spinach</b></p> <p>For the butter</p> <p><b>10 anchovy fillets</b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp capers</b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp gherkins</b></p> <p><b>3 hard-boiled egg yolks</b></p> <p><b>125g mixture of fresh herbs - sorrel, watercress, dill, tarragon, chervil, parsley, fennel leaf, chive, mint (substitute parsley for any you can't get), all finely chopped</b></p> <p><b>125g softened butter</b></p> <p><b>6 tbsp olive oil</b></p> <p><b>Juice of 1 lemon</b></p> <p>Cook the potatoes in boiling, salted water, along with the sprig of mint.</p> <p>Pre-heat the grill at its highest setting. Meanwhile, make the butter: put the anchovies, capers and gherkins in the food processor, and whizz until finely chopped; add the egg yolks and herbs, and whizz a little more. Chop the softened butter into pieces, and add this, too. Turn the speed to low, then drizzle in the oil and lemon juice. Season and set aside - do not refrigerate.</p> <p>Rub a good pinch of salt into the skin of the salmon (this helps crisp it up in the cooking) and some pepper. Brush a baking tray with oil, place the fish skin-side up on a baking sheet, and grill on the shelf second furthest from the flame, until the skin is crispy and the flesh opaque. Turn and cook for two minutes more (or barbecue it skin-side down, turning it when it goes opaque on top).</p> <p>When the potatoes are cooked, drain them, and toss with the spinach (it will wilt in the heat of the spuds) and some seasoning. Serve the salmon on a bed of the spinach and potatoes, topped with a healthy dollop of the butter and a squeeze of lemon juice.</p>",

And if the ingredients just happen to fix the body as well, then who's complaining? All recipes serve four. Guinea Fowl with elderflower The elderflower season is so short that it's a good idea to find as many uses for them as possible - not least as they are reputed to calm the nerves. 8 heads elderflower 1 lemon 1 guinea fowl, approx 1.5kg 1 tbsp sunflower oil 2 onions 1 leek 5 sticks celery 3 carrots 500ml chicken stock 400ml elderflower p\u00e9tillante (or 350ml white wine, plus 50ml water and 2 tbsp elderflower cordial) 1 bayleaf Pick the elderflowers as near to the time of using them as possible (and preferably not from beside a roaring main road, both for your own safety and for the fact that they may have a good dose of eau de traffic). Once picked, give the flowers a very hearty shake, to expel any lurking bugs and any mature, dry blooms, then wash in cold water and leave to drip dry. Meanwhile, wash the lemon, if it is waxy, cut it in half and place one half inside the cavity of the bird, followed by all but one of the elderflower heads. Heat the oil in a deep, heavy pan, season the bird, then brown all over in the oil and remove. Roughly chop all the vegetables, and saut\u00e9 them in the same pan as the guinea fowl. Season well, pour in the stock, then lay the bird on the bed of vegetables, add the elderflower p\u00e9tillante and bayleaf, and bring to a simmer. Turn the heat right down and leave the fowl to poach gently for about 45 minutes, or until its juices run clear when pierced with a skewer. Leave to rest while you make the sauce. Strain off the cooking liquid and reserve. Lift out the bayleaf and whizz the cooked vegetables in a processor. Gradually add the strained liquor as the mixture begins to resemble a pur\u00e9e, adding as much as you need to achieve a sauce-like consistency (I like quite a thin sauce, so use all the cooking liquor and, perhaps, a couple of tablespoons of hot water as well). Joint the fowl, and serve with a good ladleful of sauce and a scattering of elderflowers from the reserved head. Lamb with watercress in pastry The inspiration for this came from lamb wrapped in vine leaves and pastry, made by Joyce Molyneux at the Carved Angel, Dartmouth. Watercress is a bracing and peppery herb, considered by herbalists to be good for rheumatic pains and bronchitis. These can be prepared well in advance, and cooked just before serving. For the pastry 275g plain flour 1 pinch salt 225g butter, cold and cut in cubes 120ml cold water 1 egg white, for glazing For the filling 2 tbsp oil 2 shallots, finely chopped 2 bunches watercress, washed and chopped, thick stalks removed 50g butter Sea salt and black pepper 2 tbsp vermouth 1kg lamb fillet, taken from the thicker end and cut into four First, make the pastry: place the dry ingredients in a food processor, add the butter, and process to the texture of fine breadcrumbs. Slowly add the chilled water to form a dough. Bring the dough together, wrap it in cling-film and leave to rest in the fridge for half-an-hour. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan, and sweat the shallots. When they are soft, add the watercress, butter, seasoning and vermouth, cover and cook until the watercress has wilted a little. Remove the lid, and reduce the liquid until it clings to the leaves. Set aside to cool. Heat the rest of the oil in a large frying pan, and brown the meat all over. Transfer to a plate, and leave to cool. Cut four pieces from the pastry, and roll into 16cm x 10cm rectangles about the thickness of a 10p piece - you may want to trim it, to get straight edges. Leave to rest in a cool place (but not in the fridge - if it gets too hard, it may be difficult to work with) while you make a couple of deep slashes in each piece of meat and fill these with watercress mixture. Smear any leftover watercress over the outside of the meat. Place a piece of meat in the centre of each pastry rectangle, brush the edges with egg white and envelop the filling, seam-side down. Leave to rest until it is time to cook them, and for at least 30 minutes. Pre-heat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4, glaze the pastry parcels with egg white and cut a small cross in the top of each one. Bake for around 25 minutes, until the pastry is golden. Serve immediately with a simple green salad, and some cherry tomatoes roasted with rosemary and garlic. Roast Pork with herbs Based on an Elizabeth David recipe from French Provincial Cooking, this is delicious hot or cold. 8-bone best end of pork, chined and skinned, skin reserved 2 cloves garlic, peeled and cut into slivers 300ml white wine 2 onions, roughly chopped 2 sprigs thyme 1 bayleaf 300ml chicken stock 100g soft white breadcrumbs Grated rind of 1 lemon 1 large handful parsley, finely chopped 8 sage leaves, finely chopped Season the meat, and slip the slivers of garlic in among the bones. In a baking tray, place the meat fat side up on top of the skin, pour over the wine, and scatter over the onion and herbs. Leave to marinade for a few hours, basting from time to time. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Cover the meat (tin foil is best), roast for about 20 minutes, then turn down the heat to 175C/ 350F/gas mark 4. Add the chicken stock, and cook for another hour. Mix together the breadcrumbs, lemon zest, parsley and sage. When the hour is up, take the meat out of the oven, remove the cover, skim the fat from the cooking liquor and remove the skin underneath the meat and discard - it has done its job, which is to enrich the cooking juices. Cover the fat with the herby breadcrumbs, and press them in well (use a palette knife if you prefer not to do this by hand). Return the meat to the oven, and cook for a further 30 minutes, until the crumbs have formed a golden, herby crust. Place the joint on a warm serving dish to rest. Skim off the fat from the cooking juices, then taste what's left, reduce it a little, if necessary, and strain what's left into a jug, for serving with the meat. New potatoes and Savoy cabbage or curly kale go splendidly with this. If you are serving the meat cold, you probably won't want to serve the cooking juices (save them for a gravy day), and serve with a crunchy coleslaw of cabbage, carrot, fennel and spring onion to go with the steamed new potatoes. Herb and feta potato cakes with tomato, broad bean and mint salad Just about the perfect summer lunch. For the potato cakes 2 onions, peeled and grated 2 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp butter 500g potatoes, peeled and coarsely grated 120g plain flour 4 eggs, beaten 120g feta cheese 2 heaped tbsp each mint, parsley, chives and dill For the salad 500g fresh plum tomatoes 2 spring onions 1kg broad beans, podded, blanched and popped from their skins 4 tbsp olive oil Juice of 1 lemon 1 handful picked mint leaves Place the grated onion on a clean tea towel, fold up and squeeze as much liquid out as you can. Heat one tablespoon of oil in a large, heavy-based pan and add the butter, then saut\u00e9 the onions for a couple of minutes. Meanwhile, thoroughly squeeze the liquid from the potatoes, add to the onion mix, and stir from time to time until the mixture is golden all over. Tip into a bowl, and leave to cool for a while. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Add the flour, eggs, feta, seasoning and herbs to the potato-and-onion ensemble, and mix well. Brush a cake tin with the remaining oil, tip the mixture into the tin and bake for 20 minutes, until crisp and golden. While the potato cake is cooking, quarter the tomatoes, finely slice the spring onions and toss them with the beans, olive oil, lemon juice and seasoning. To serve, cut the potato cake into quarters, and rip up the mint leaves and mix them into the salad. Salmon with Montpellier butter and Jersey royals The butter is an old classic, and is crammed with herbs. Grill the fish or, even better, barbecue it. 500g Jersey royals, washed 1 sprig fresh mint 800g salmon fillet (preferably wild) 2 tbsp olive oil 2 large handfuls baby spinach For the butter 10 anchovy fillets 2 tbsp capers 1 tbsp gherkins 3 hard-boiled egg yolks 125g mixture of fresh herbs - sorrel, watercress, dill, tarragon, chervil, parsley, fennel leaf, chive, mint (substitute parsley for any you can't get), all finely chopped 125g softened butter 6 tbsp olive oil Juice of 1 lemon Cook the potatoes in boiling, salted water, along with the sprig of mint. Pre-heat the grill at its highest setting. Meanwhile, make the butter: put the anchovies, capers and gherkins in the food processor, and whizz until finely chopped; add the egg yolks and herbs, and whizz a little more. Chop the softened butter into pieces, and add this, too. Turn the speed to low, then drizzle in the oil and lemon juice. Season and set aside - do not refrigerate. Rub a good pinch of salt into the skin of the salmon (this helps crisp it up in the cooking) and some pepper. Brush a baking tray with oil, place the fish skin-side up on a baking sheet, and grill on the shelf second furthest from the flame, until the skin is crispy and the flesh opaque. Turn and cook for two minutes more (or barbecue it skin-side down, turning it when it goes opaque on top). When the potatoes are cooked, drain them, and toss with the spinach (it will wilt in the heat of the spuds) and some seasoning. Serve the salmon on a bed of the spinach and potatoes, topped with a healthy dollop of the butter and a squeeze of lemon juice.",

      "body": "<p>I've been feeling a peculiar pang all week about C&amp;A closing, though I can't have been inside one since I was 12. It was the sort of place my mother used to drag me round on a Saturday afternoon in the very early 70s, looking for holiday clothes to wear on the annual Butlin's beano, and we'd invariably row because I wanted sludge-coloured midi-skirts from Chelsea Girl and she wanted me to wear acrylic turquoise minis. \"Why are you trying to make me dress like a child prostitute, Mother?\" I would invariably hiss, to be answered by a resounding slap around the ear and a triumphant hiss of, \"Wait till I get thee 'ome!\" Happy days. </p> <p>My mother didn't want me to look like a child prostitute, of course; she only wanted me to carry on being Her Little Girl for a bit longer, a bit of a fool's errand once Marc Bolan, ambition and masturbation were in the frame. C&amp;A was good at making little girls look very little, and the middle-aged look very middle-aged; it wasn't hot on the perennial teen look, and when it tried to do \"swinging\", it ended up as the Panda Pops version of Coke. But nostalgia has a funny way of getting to you, and if I concentrate very hard I find I can bring myself to the verge of tears (not all the way - Good Lord, let's keep a sense of proportion here) just thinking about those bri-nylon shirts with matching tie and hanky on men who smelled of Hai Karate; and those acrylic, Jacquard tunics on ladies called Audrey and Avril, blushing beneath their Max Factor Creme Puff as they danced slow with their next door neighbour to Can't Take My Eyes Off You. Those were innocent, heady days, after the Pill but before Aids, and it hit our parents for six. And it was C&amp;A that dressed them for their brief shining place in the sun. </p> <p>I don't care that C&amp;A is Dutch; look at William of Orange.

      "bodyText": "I've been feeling a peculiar pang all week about C&amp;A closing, though I can't have been inside one since I was 12. It was the sort of place my mother used to drag me round on a Saturday afternoon in the very early 70s, looking for holiday clothes to wear on the annual Butlin's beano, and we'd invariably row because I wanted sludge-coloured midi-skirts from Chelsea Girl and she wanted me to wear acrylic turquoise minis. \"Why are you trying to make me dress like a child prostitute, Mother?\" I would invariably hiss, to be answered by a resounding slap around the ear and a triumphant hiss of, \"Wait till I get thee 'ome!\" Happy days. My mother didn't want me to look like a child prostitute, of course; she only wanted me to carry on being Her Little Girl for a bit longer, a bit of a fool's errand once Marc Bolan, ambition and masturbation were in the frame. C&amp;A was good at making little girls look very little, and the middle-aged look very middle-aged; it wasn't hot on the perennial teen look, and when it tried to do \"swinging\", it ended up as the Panda Pops version of Coke. But nostalgia has a funny way of getting to you, and if I concentrate very hard I find I can bring myself to the verge of tears (not all the way - Good Lord, let's keep a sense of proportion here) just thinking about those bri-nylon shirts with matching tie and hanky on men who smelled of Hai Karate; and those acrylic, Jacquard tunics on ladies called Audrey and Avril, blushing beneath their Max Factor Creme Puff as they danced slow with their next door neighbour to Can't Take My Eyes Off You. Those were innocent, heady days, after the Pill but before Aids, and it hit our parents for six. And it was C&amp;A that dressed them for their brief shining place in the sun. I don't care that C&amp;A is Dutch; look at William of Orange. The point is that it, like he, made us more English. My blood runs cold when I try to imagine what they're going to put in our big C&amp;A building in Brighton.

      "body": "<p>Up on the ridge of the the Vidourle valley, in the southern French province of Gard, is one of a few houses in the country regarded as a work of art. La Muse was built from memory by the artist, designer and carpenter Michel Roubinet. Everything in the house is hand-made, according to the dream in its creator's head.</p> <p>Anybody who sets off from the valley to try to find the house will have a similar experience. Along the dirt road, winding up the mountain under the chestnut trees, things quickly start to look as if they are going nowhere. As you get higher, the road gets smaller and darker, there are no signs of life. You begin to feel that you're well and truly lost when suddenly you will come to a breathtaking view of long rows of valleys to the south. At the same time, there is the house in front of you, curving along the side of the mountain-top on the other side of the road.</p> <p>The present owners are Frank and Patricia Dubiez. They are writers, designers and publishers of children's books, and have lived here for seven years. Before he found La Muse in 1993, Frank, a Parisian, had already made several attempts to find a house that he liked in the south. He bought La Muse, he says, after a careful 15 minutes' consideration. \"It was the most beautiful house I had ever seen,\" he remembers, \"and it still is. You cannot be neutral towards this house. We see this happen to all the people who visit us here: you either fall for it, like we did, or you hate it. There is nothing in between.\"</p> <p>Two years before the couple's arrival on this C\u00e9vennes mountain top, Michel Roubinet, the designer and builder of La Muse, was killed in an accident when building material fell from the crane he was using to finish the house. Roubinet was from the Atlantic coast region of Bordeaux, and specialised in designing and building boat interiors. He was a great admirer of the Spanish architect Antonio Gaud\u00ed and of Spanish-Moorish architecture, and his house was going to form the first part of an artist's colony.</p> <p>In 1985, without any drawings, Roubinet began building his house and laid the first stone on the mountain-top: a pentagon, now in the middle of the floor of the central space of the house. Right above it in the ceiling is a similar shape, and from there the house was constructed in a spiral, wind-ing outwards and upwards.</p> <p>All the floor-tiles radiate out, like sun rays, from the pentagon to the outer walls, as do the roof-beams and the roof-tiles. There are also round, dome-like ceilings, such as the one in the bathroom, attached to the central pentagon. Straight walls are set with bricks; curved walls are constructed from a skeleton of welded ironwork filled with straw, polystyrene and chicken wire, then plastered with cement.</p> <p>La Muse is like the spiral shell of a snail: it grew in an organic way, without any planning permission - slowly, room after room, as the money and ideas emerged.

      "bodyText": "Up on the ridge of the the Vidourle valley, in the southern French province of Gard, is one of a few houses in the country regarded as a work of art. La Muse was built from memory by the artist, designer and carpenter Michel Roubinet. Everything in the house is hand-made, according to the dream in its creator's head. Anybody who sets off from the valley to try to find the house will have a similar experience. Along the dirt road, winding up the mountain under the chestnut trees, things quickly start to look as if they are going nowhere. As you get higher, the road gets smaller and darker, there are no signs of life. You begin to feel that you're well and truly lost when suddenly you will come to a breathtaking view of long rows of valleys to the south. At the same time, there is the house in front of you, curving along the side of the mountain-top on the other side of the road. The present owners are Frank and Patricia Dubiez. They are writers, designers and publishers of children's books, and have lived here for seven years. Before he found La Muse in 1993, Frank, a Parisian, had already made several attempts to find a house that he liked in the south. He bought La Muse, he says, after a careful 15 minutes' consideration. \"It was the most beautiful house I had ever seen,\" he remembers, \"and it still is. You cannot be neutral towards this house. We see this happen to all the people who visit us here: you either fall for it, like we did, or you hate it. There is nothing in between.\" Two years before the couple's arrival on this C\u00e9vennes mountain top, Michel Roubinet, the designer and builder of La Muse, was killed in an accident when building material fell from the crane he was using to finish the house. Roubinet was from the Atlantic coast region of Bordeaux, and specialised in designing and building boat interiors. He was a great admirer of the Spanish architect Antonio Gaud\u00ed and of Spanish-Moorish architecture, and his house was going to form the first part of an artist's colony. In 1985, without any drawings, Roubinet began building his house and laid the first stone on the mountain-top: a pentagon, now in the middle of the floor of the central space of the house. Right above it in the ceiling is a similar shape, and from there the house was constructed in a spiral, wind-ing outwards and upwards. All the floor-tiles radiate out, like sun rays, from the pentagon to the outer walls, as do the roof-beams and the roof-tiles. There are also round, dome-like ceilings, such as the one in the bathroom, attached to the central pentagon. Straight walls are set with bricks; curved walls are constructed from a skeleton of welded ironwork filled with straw, polystyrene and chicken wire, then plastered with cement. La Muse is like the spiral shell of a snail: it grew in an organic way, without any planning permission - slowly, room after room, as the money and ideas emerged. The local planning department had so little understanding of what was going on that at one point Roubinet had to ask an architect to draw up official-looking building-plans for a house that was already well underway. But when the house was declared a work of art by the authorities, Roubinet's emerging problems with the planning powers quickly disappeared. Two years after Roubinet's death, his widow, Helene, a psychoanalyst, sold La Muse to Frank for a price he could afford because he was a \"kindred spirit\". She felt he would finish it sympathetically. \"The first year I was not able to do anything,\" Frank says. \"The personality of the house was too strong. Then I got used to it.

I have found six spicy whites. Asda's Baron de Turckheim Gew\u00fcrztraminer 1998 (16 points, \u00a37.49) is deliciously, thickly textured, has the regulation lychee-and-rose-petal fruit, and is great with robust Chinese food.

It is, at its price, a bargain.</p> <p>Majestic has Australian Capel Vale Verdelho 1999 (16 points, \u00a37.99 a bottle, or \u00a36.99 if you buy, as part of a case or mixed case, two bottles or more). This is a wonderful, concentrated vintage, resulting in a warmly coated, subtly spicy wine of polished demeanour and great cellaring potential. It is also available at Safeway.</p> <p>Two delightfully spicy Alsatian whites at Majestic are Bott-Geyl Gew\u00fcrztraminer Schlosselreben de Beblenheim 1998 (17 points, \u00a312.99) and Bott-Geyl Gew\u00fcrztraminer Grand Cru Sonnenglanz 1998 (17.5 points, \u00a315.99). These are two hugely impressive wines of majesterial complexity and potency. The Schlosselreben has great richness and half-sweet spiciness that will only develop over time. My guess is that it will rate 20 points if cellared for some years: 10? 12? 15? God knows. I don't.</p> <p>The Sonnenglanz is about as assertive as a young, frisky gew\u00fcrz can get, offering, as it does, pears, peaches, rose petals, raspberries, honey and intriguing minerally acids. Left for seven to eight years, it'll rate 20 points, too. For opening when one meets the perfect herb-and-spice gardener, perchance.</p> <p>Also at Majestic, and at 77 branches of Safeway (01622 712926 for details) is Oxford Landing Limited Release Viognier 1999 (17 points, \u00a35.99), from Australia. The lingering apricot fruit and subtle spiciness are remarkably insistent and sensory.</p> <p>Herby reds? I can offer you four: Vacqueyras Domaine de l'Oiselet 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a35.99, Asda) is rousingly warm and ripe, with rivulets of plump, blackcurrant fruit with eager tannins.</p> <p>Tesco has a non-vintage Minervois that also fits the bill. Rating 14 points and costing \u00a32.99, it is very blackcurrant-jammy, with a hint of the Midi scrub and earth.</p> <p>Sainsbury has Stowells of Chelsea Merlot Vin de Pays d'Oc in a three-litre box. True, the herbs are slight, but it is a dry, subtly leathery wine with a hint of earthiness and, though normally \u00a313.79, is on offer at \u00a311.79 until July 1. A 15-point wine at 49p a glass has to be a bargain.</p> <p>Last of all, a wine with herbs and spice: Sainsbury s non-vintage, own-label South African Pinotage, rating 16 points. It parades hints of burnt rubber, cassis/plum fruit, a herby, savoury tannic presence, a coriander herbiness and a cinnamon and cardamom touch on the finish. Quite a mouthful for \u00a34.29.</p>",

I can offer you four: Vacqueyras Domaine de l'Oiselet 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a35.99, Asda) is rousingly warm and ripe, with rivulets of plump, blackcurrant fruit with eager tannins. Tesco has a non-vintage Minervois that also fits the bill. Rating 14 points and costing \u00a32.99, it is very blackcurrant-jammy, with a hint of the Midi scrub and earth. Sainsbury has Stowells of Chelsea Merlot Vin de Pays d'Oc in a three-litre box. True, the herbs are slight, but it is a dry, subtly leathery wine with a hint of earthiness and, though normally \u00a313.79, is on offer at \u00a311.79 until July 1. A 15-point wine at 49p a glass has to be a bargain. Last of all, a wine with herbs and spice: Sainsbury s non-vintage, own-label South African Pinotage, rating 16 points. It parades hints of burnt rubber, cassis/plum fruit, a herby, savoury tannic presence, a coriander herbiness and a cinnamon and cardamom touch on the finish. Quite a mouthful for \u00a34.29.",

      "body": "<p>What, I wonder, would John Evelyn (1620-1706), diarist, herbalist and cook, make of the fruit-and-veg display in the average modern-day supermarket? He'd be a tad disappointed, in all likelihood. Some of the things on offer might seem a bit weird and wonderful to him, sure - not least that they may be out of season - and he might not recognise all the fruits. But as for the herbs - what a pitiful range! What miserable bundles! And how much?</p> <p>The use of herbs is as old as history. The Egyptians of 5,000 years ago obligingly left prescriptions on clay tablets and papyrus scrolls. The Assyrians, Chaldeans and Chinese all had schools of herbalists. And what is known as the Ebers papyrus of 1,500BC gives around 700 remedies.</p> <p>By 500BC, Hippocrates, and then Aristotle and a chap called Theophrastus, set about codifying contemporary knowledge of herbs, before Dioscoredes, a Greek doctor in the Roman army, wrote the first herbal round about 200AD.</p> <p>Up to this point, herbs had been used - for official purposes, at any rate - for treating various ailments. We don't know much about the way herbs were used in cookery until The Life Of Luxury, by Archestratus, who lived in Gela, Sicily, during the fourth century BC, and even he didn't tell us that much, because only fragments of his work survive today. In fact, we had to wait until somewhere around the fifth century AD, and De Re Coquinaria (On Cookery), by Apicius, to get a real picture of culinary herbs. As students of Gladiator, not to mention Ben Hur, will know, the Romans loved something with a bit of kick in it, and a good many of the recipes that Apicius rattles off are, by modern standards, pretty potent in their use of spices, vinegar, honey and fish essence. Oregano, parsley, rocket, sweet cicely, chervil, sage, thyme, fennel, mint and bay all add their bit from time to time.</p> <p>The habit of spicing food highly is generally thought to be the result of the need to disguise fish or meat that had gone off. Spices were far too expensive for all but the richest houses, but herbs, which grow wild and free, had the advantage of being more generally available. Also, herbals, which detailed the medical and culinary uses of herbs, became widely used after the invention of printing.</p> <p>The use of herbs has a long and exceptionally vigorous tradition in Britain. Once, there wasn't a garden of a great house or monastery that did not have a substantial space devoted to growing a wide range, all of which had practical uses in the communities for which they were grown. Typically, there would be thyme, rosemary, parsley, mint, borage, chervil, coriander, dill, tansy, camphor, balm, garlic, lemon verbena, fennel, sorrel, catmint, marjoram, golden and common sage, lovage, summer and winter savory, sweet cicely, lavender, hyssop and tarragon.</p> <p>We should also remember that, whatever people may think about the euro and the bogey men in Brussels, when it comes to food, the British have always been quick to pick out the best ideas from across the water and adapt them to our own purposes.</p> <p>The Dean of Wells, William Turner, travelled widely in Italy and Germany, and was well acquainted with both herbs and herbals before writing the New Herbal, which appeared in three volumes during the mid-16th century. Even better known was Gerard's Herball, or Generall Historie Of Plantes, published in 1597, in which John Gerard of Holborn catalogued and described all the herbs in \"the little plot of myne owne\".</p> <p>By the time John Evelyn came to write Acetaria, A Discourse Of Sallets, in 1699, we were familiar with all manner of European herbs, dishes and cooking techniques. Evelyn refers to \"sweet, aromatick Spanish chervile\"; to fennel, \"the sweetest of Bologna\"; avers that the best sorrel \"is of Greenland\"; and refers to tarragon as being \"of Spanish extraction\". This shows a degree of sophistication that few would be able to match today, even with all the resources of the internet at their command.</p> <p>Since then, herbs have been a central part of British cookery. We may tend to think of many of them as ingredients in foreign dishes, but even a cursory study of such cookery writers as Patrick Lambe, Hannah Glasse, Elizabeth Raffald and Eliza Acton is to trace the use and influence of herbs in our own distinctive dishes. At the same time, great and beautiful gardens celebrating herbs were created century by century, from that of Lytes Cary Manor in Somerset, created in the 16th century by Sir Henry Lyte, author of the Niewe Herball, to Gertrude Jekyll's quincunx herb garden at Knebworth in Hertfordshire and the thyme walk at Highgrove, Prince Charles's country hideaway.</p> <p>But perhaps we are, at long last, beginning to rediscover our love of herbs. It wasn't so very long ago that if you had wanted basil, you would have had to grow it yourself. Now, thanks to our passion for Italian food, we have basil by the bush-load. And perhaps we have the French to thank for the sprigs of tarragon, the Greeks for the oregano, and the Poles for the dill. No matter - they are all back in our kitchens, and we should be grateful for that.</p> <p>I am not talking, here, about dried herbs - they have always been with us: little bottles of dull green bits of uncertain provenance carrying the ghost of the flavour of the fresh plant, which you throw away once a year, unloved, unused. There have been attempts to improve herb-preserving technology, what with \"freeze drying\" and plain freezing (actually, not a bad way of having tough herbs such as parsley and tarragon ready to hand all year, but it tends to reduce the more delicate items, such as chervil, basil or marjoram, to black and bitter cud), but in reality they are nothing when compared with the fresh, unsullied article.</p> <p>Which is why we are devoting this Food &amp; Drink Summer Special to celebrating herbs, in a great many, if not quite all, their variety - where to buy them, how to grow them, how to cook them, even how to drink them. This is the season of the fresh herb, after all. If you are grand, you can grow them in a traditional knot garden. If you're not at all grand, you can grow them, as I do, on the small patch at the back of the house. You can grow them in pots. You can grown them in window-boxes, and plunder them at will. And, of course, if you are desperate, you can pick up the packets at your local superstore or, if you're lucky, find them at a farmers' market.</p> <p>And once you have them, toss them into salads, sprinkle them over barbecued bits and bobs, infuse drinks with them, turn them in jellies, or just sniff and nibble them, if you have a mind to. But, whatever you do, heap them \"with unsparing hand\", to quote Evelyn quoting Milton. Parsimony has no place when it comes to herbs.

The Chelsea Physic Garden is a true oasis: four magical acres in the heart of the big smoke. It's the sort of place that you plan to visit for an hour or two, only to find that four have slipped by before you've even noticed. But, enchanting as it is, there is a practical history behind this most secluded corner of London.</p> <p>From the Middle Ages onwards, the plants you grew - if you were fortunate enough to have your own land, that is - depended to a great extent on your level in society. The gardens of the lower ranks would be filled predominantly with common salads and vegetables. Those belonging to wealthy households, however, in addition to growing a far wider choice of vegetables, would also contain a selection of medicinal plants - henbane, for example, a powerful poison if taken in large quantities, but much used as a tranquilliser and to allay pain; or agrimony, which was used as a gargle to relax sore throats, or sipped to treat diarrhoea; and hyssop, which was used to treat a wide range of ailments, from coughs, colds and asthma to black eyes and stomach complaints.</p> <p>Other herbs, meanwhile, were cultivated purely for their culinary value, and contributed greatly to the palatability of the often bland and repetitive dishes of the time. And in the houses of the upper orders, posies of aromatic herbs were used as decoration, in the belief that their perfume would have a sanitising effect, cleansing the air and warding off potentially fatal diseases.</p> <p>At that time, the importance of herbs in treating illness was absolutely vital. It is hard for us today - with our armoury of prescription medicines, antibiotics and a pharmacist on every high street - to remember just how fragile life can be. As is still the case in many parts of the world, the simplest ailments and infections were often fatal, and herbal remedies offered the only chance of survival. Many of those herbs were native to Britain, and grew wild (as they still do today), and as such poorer families would collect and use them in an attempt to stave off disease.</p> <p>There were privately-owned herb gardens, but these were usually very small. As a result, apothecaries were hindered in the practice of their art by poor access to a sufficiently wide range of plants, and by a lack of training. As a result, by the 17th century the large physic gardens became vital as places where an enormous range of herbs could be collected, studied, and their medicinal and culinary effects recorded. As new plants were introduced from abroad, the gardens took on the role of living reference libraries.</p> <p>Founded in 1673 by the Society of Apothecaries, the Chelsea Physic Garden is the oldest still in existence in London. Its original purpose was to gather in one place a full range of medicinal herbs and plants, thereby at last giving medical students the opportunity to study at first hand the plants they would later use to treat the sick. Today, the garden still collects and collates a vast range of plants, adding continually to the 5,000 or so species already there and exchanging seed with other botanic gardens all over the world. The garden is renowned for its mild microclimate - the olive tree, for example, fruits regularly, and many tender species survive outside all year round with only the simplest protection - and plants are arranged by family, by their use or by their region of origin.</p> <p>The large area that is devoted to culinary herbs and medicinal plants is a particular inspiration. Enter the garden from Swan Walk, and you are greeted by an avenue of lavender, the enduring Lavandula 'Hidcote'. To the right of this are the herbal beds. One of these, The Garden Of World Medicine, contains plants used by ancient cultures and indigenous tribal peoples. Another displays naturally-occurring analgesics: tall opium poppies ( Papaver somniferum ), with their glaucous, blue-green foliage and seductive, papery blooms swaying gently above Mandragora officinarum , better known as mandrake. Plants used in modern herbal medicine, such as Arnica montana , now an endangered alpine herb, are in another section. With the recent resurgence in interest in alternative and homeopathic treatments, the repository of knowledge in this garden has proved a vital resource.</p> <p>The garden also plays an important role in discovering and developing modern mainstream medicines: the Madagascar periwinkle, for example, has been found to contain a drug that is used in the treatment of cancer. Such naturally-occurring plant remedies remain a largely untapped area - only a fraction of the world's flora has been investigated - so the potential for exciting developments is enormous.</p> <p>In the 17th century, \"laundry gardens\" were common, planted with aromatic thymes and lavender on which household linens would be laid out to dry, so becoming suffused with scent. One area of Chelsea is still devoted to plants used in perfumery and aromatherapy: a huge clump of Salvia officinalis , smothered in mauve flowers with deeper purple bracts, pumps out a strong and, to my nose, not entirely pleasant aroma. It was a favourite of the Romans, and is used today in the pharmaceuticals and cosmetics industry, as well as in the production of vermouth.</p> <p>And then there are the culinary herb beds. Chelsea has one vast bed devoted to these beauties, and it fair buzzes with bees, not to mention fragrance. It contains rosemary, bay and several deliciously-named thymes - caraway, lemon and orange-scented varieties, blanketed in thousands of tiny flowers in soft mauves and pinks - that hail from the sun-baked hills around the Mediterranean. These grow alongside purple-leaved basils, tarragon and flat-leaf parsley, all so important to Italian cookery. Golden-leaved marjoram, widely used in Greece, joins chives, chervil, dill and parsley, all traditional herbs of the northern European kitchen. A collection of mints, grown in individual terracotta pots, are plunged up to their rims into the soil to contain their invasive growth habit.</p> <p>Elsewhere, vibrant orange swathes of pot marigolds ( Calendula officinalis ) glow in the sun. Originally grown for its mildly antiseptic properties in the treatment of ulcers and wounds, marigold petals and stamens are now used to colour foods, in much the same way as saffron - indeed, many an unwitting traveller has bought what seemed like a bargain bag of \"saffron\" in the east Mediterranean, unaware that it was full of marigold. Butterflies dart around the herb blooms, which grow among red orache and pink-flowered red valerian, adding to a cocktail of colours that is brought to order by an edging of santolina, punctuated by a clipped box ball at each corner.</p> <p>It's enough to inspire anyone to plant a small herb garden of their own. After all, popping vacuum-packed herbs into your supermarket trolley may be convenient, but it's not the same as strolling into your garden, enjoying the sight, scent and texture of the plants, and then the enhanced taste that comes with freshness. Once you've tasted tea made with freshly-picked mint, say, and enjoyed the delicate colour and intense flavour, you'll never buy a box of mint teabags again.</p> <p>\u0095 Chelsea Physic Garden, 66 Royal Hospital Road, London SW3, 020-7352 5646.

These grow alongside purple-leaved basils, tarragon and flat-leaf parsley, all so important to Italian cookery. Golden-leaved marjoram, widely used in Greece, joins chives, chervil, dill and parsley, all traditional herbs of the northern European kitchen. A collection of mints, grown in individual terracotta pots, are plunged up to their rims into the soil to contain their invasive growth habit. Elsewhere, vibrant orange swathes of pot marigolds ( Calendula officinalis ) glow in the sun. Originally grown for its mildly antiseptic properties in the treatment of ulcers and wounds, marigold petals and stamens are now used to colour foods, in much the same way as saffron - indeed, many an unwitting traveller has bought what seemed like a bargain bag of \"saffron\" in the east Mediterranean, unaware that it was full of marigold. Butterflies dart around the herb blooms, which grow among red orache and pink-flowered red valerian, adding to a cocktail of colours that is brought to order by an edging of santolina, punctuated by a clipped box ball at each corner. It's enough to inspire anyone to plant a small herb garden of their own. After all, popping vacuum-packed herbs into your supermarket trolley may be convenient, but it's not the same as strolling into your garden, enjoying the sight, scent and texture of the plants, and then the enhanced taste that comes with freshness. Once you've tasted tea made with freshly-picked mint, say, and enjoyed the delicate colour and intense flavour, you'll never buy a box of mint teabags again. \u0095 Chelsea Physic Garden, 66 Royal Hospital Road, London SW3, 020-7352 5646.

      "body": "<p>The great Antoine Brillat-Savarin said that he didn't eat grapes because he didn't like to take his wine in capsule form. Some people probably don't like drinking herby drinks for the opposite reason: they don't want to take their herbs in liquid form. They're wrong. The repertoire of herb-based potables is extensive and impressive, and it's one of the few areas in which Britain ranks among world leaders.</p> <p>If a single nation takes top marks in the drinkable herb field, however, it has to be Italy - herbs were used for their ostensibly medicinal properties long before they were regarded as food, and no one has taken that message to heart more enthusiastically. It was the Italians, remember, who invented (or at least established the credibility of) vermouth. Vermouth has its ultimate origins in artemisia absinthum (or absinthiatum), a herbal gastric remedy supposedly devised by Hippocrates. The modern version dates from the early 17th century, when a Piedmontese herbalist named Alessio devised and published a recipe for vinum absinthiatum. Its fame spread, and Alessio was summoned to make it for the Bavarian court, where it became known as \"Wermuth wein\", from the German for wormwood. Turin became the centre of production, however, thanks to its supply of Alpine herbs. In the 19th century, companies such as Cinzano, Martini and Riccadonna devised the recipes that eventually made them major international brands.</p> <p>But vermouth is just part of the Italian love affair with potable herbs. In Gastronomy Of Italy (reissued in September by Pavilion, \u00a340), Anna del Conte writes that there are as many Italian herb-based liqueurs \"as there are monks and monasteries\". They drink stuff such as Centerbe, a liqueur made from 100 different herbs \"gathered on and around the peaks of the Maiella in Abruzzo\". And Fernet Branca. And Averna. And Punt e Mes. And, of course, tankers-full of Campari. Italian specialists sell the more obscure of these drinks, if you're interested, as does Gerry's (020-7734 2053), in London.</p> <p>Many foreigners (though not all, it has to be said) regard this obsession with pungent, bitter herbal drinks as a serious deficiency of taste in a country that invented linguini alle vongole and minestrone. Me, I'm one of them. But I am suspending final judgment until I visit a herbal liqueur producer called Lombardi &amp; Visconti, in Abbadia San Salvatore near Siena, which I read about in Carla Capalbo's Food Lover's Companion To Siena (Pallas Athene, \u00a312.95). I want to try a range that includes a genuine artemisia absinthum and, especially, the Elisir Lucrezia, made with basil and sage.</p> <p>When the British put herbs in drinks, they usually try to push buttons that are bucolic rather than urban-sophisticated or medically orientated. This is the green and pleasant land of cordials, syrups, punches and herbalised fruit cups. It is the land of Pimm's, a herb-rich drink that I think of as the legal love-drug. When the National Federation of Women's Institutes published Home Made Wine Syrups And Cordials in 1957, those bottles saw frequent use in millions of homes. Today, in the age of McCooking, the number must be significantly lower.</p> <p>But it's still done - and it's still a relatively simple matter. To make a syrup, you just cover the elderflower florets with water, simmer for 30 minutes and strain, then squeeze out the juice and return it to the pan with around 400g of sugar for each pint of liquid. Simmer again for 10 minutes, cool, bottle and sterilise. For a cordial, you simply use a higher proportion of water to solid matter - or make your cordial by diluting the syrup.</p> <p>On a commercial scale, the cordial market is dominated by Bottle Green, whose products are very sound, though I have always been a fan of those made by Rocks, a small family firm in Berkshire. Its range is mostly fruit-based, but its elderflower cordial is a particularly delicious specimen (it can be found in some supermarkets, or order from SimplyOrganic, 0845 1000444).</p> <p>The bulk of sipped herbs in Britain nowadays comes, I suspect, in the form of so-called herb teas. These have nothing to do with tea, apart from being steeped in the same manner. Better to call them tisanes, and better to make your own than buy most commercially available formulations. I've long been a fan of camomile tea, but when I made my own from loose, dried camomile I saw what I had been missing: freshness, pungency - and cost-cutting in spades. Health-food shops and specialist grocers will sell loose stuff in plastic bags, and it is far superior to any bag. And far superior, also, to Aqua Libra, bottled water flavoured with tarragon, among other things - if you like it, you're entitled to your opinion. Just as I'm entitled to mine.</p> <p>For the rest of the herbal cohort, the range of drinkables is more limited. The recipes here are a mixed bunch. Some are tr\u00e8s moderne (the two herby Martinis, for instance), the others are classic: a tisane, a punch, and the great mint julep with which Kentucky gentlemen quench their thirsts on a hot summer's day.

      "body": "<p>This boy is perfect. He is healthy and strong. He has a wide smile, a chipped tooth and floppy, dark blond hair. His limbs are strong and fleshy - his belly sticks out above his trouser-belt. His shins are scuffed and bruised, his fingernails are dirty. He is beautiful. He's perfect.</p> <p>This boy is noisy and bold. He shouts at the top of his voice - at all times. He jumps up and down with excitement when he's happy. He's got a tender little scar on the right-hand side of his forehead. He picks his nose and slips a slimy finger into his mouth when he thinks you're not looking. This boy is happy. He's healthy. He's lovely.</p> <p>But this boy is booby-trapped. Somewhere inside his sturdy five-year-old body, there's a tripwire that is every bit as deadly as a terrorist bomb - it's primed and ready to blow. Trigger it, and within minutes his life is in danger. This boy has an allergy - not the sort that gives you itchy eyes, or a runny nose, or a bloated feeling in your stomach for an hour or two. It's the sort that can kill.</p> <p>He is one of a growing number of children who are allergic to nuts - it might be walnuts or brazil nuts, hazelnuts, cashews or almonds. But it is the peanut - not really a nut at all, strictly speaking, but a member of the legume family - that is most hazardous.</p> <p>Strange, isn't it? Nuts. Natural, ancient foods that sustained our hunter-gatherer ancestors. The sort of food we all thought was good for us - a healthy alternative to today's sugar-drenched, polystyrene-packed, processed-to-the-point-of-annihilation foods. For most of us, nuts - rich in energy and nutrients - are still the healthy alternative, but to this child they are as lethal as cyanide. Even if he eats the most minuscule amount, even if he simply inhales the papery dust that puffs out of tens of thousands of packets of peanuts in pubs up and down the country every day, he may become dangerously ill. First, his lips swell like party balloons, then a rash of knobbly hives flush up over his body; his skin goes blotchy, then he might start wheezing and coughing. His tongue might start swelling, his tubes may become constricted - he may start to suffocate and his blood pressure might plummet. He may collapse, lose consciousness and die. It's called anaphylactic shock, and it's a million miles from the popular idea of allergy as minor irritation or hypochondriacal delusion - a deadly riposte to voguish, smart-arse headlines such as \"Allergy - is it all in the mind?\"</p> <p>All parents worry about their children. We live our lives in a near-constant state of anxiety. We read about an outbreak of meningitis in Devon and instantly we're frightened that our child will get it, even though we live in Dundee; a little girl is abducted and killed, and we're suddenly terrified to let ours go to the corner shop; we worry about them being mown down on the roads; about drugs and dropping out, bullying, suicide and teenage pregnancy. Some of our fears are more real and rational than others, but the chances are most of them will never happen to you or your child. Chances are, he or she will grow up to be a strong, healthy adult with his or her own children to worry about. Even when you're worrying yourself sick about them, that's part of the equation: part of you subconsciously rationalises that most children will make it safely through to adulthood, despite all the risks along the way; yes, terrible things do happen, but they're more likely not to.</p> <p>So it's peculiar, having spent one's life worrying about dread and dire events that are extremely unlikely to happen, to be told that your child has a potentially fatal allergy to nuts. It's not an illness, it's not something you can see - yet your child can be perfectly healthy one minute and in intensive care the next. If he doesn't eat nuts, he will be fine; should he eat nuts, he may die. Suddenly, you have something very real to be afraid of.</p> <p>Life-threatening nut allergies have been recognised only fairly recently. In the cuttings file, little more than a sad roll-call of those who have died, the earliest article dates back to May 1990. It is a single paragraph: \"Peanuts can prove fatal to people who are allergic to them, chest specialists at University College Hospital, London, warn today after the deaths of two men who ate peanuts contained in a satay sauce and in a meal thought to be free of nuts.\"</p> <p>From that point on, the articles make for sobering reading - many of those who have died are teenagers, their deaths sudden, bizarre and shattering for all who knew them. Youngsters such as Michaela Mortimer, 16, who died minutes after eating her school lunch - a wafer she had for dessert contained peanuts; Josephine Turner, 17, who ate a peanut-filled pretzel at a cocktail party; Sarah Reading, 17, who ate a slice of lemon meringue pie that contained crushed peanuts; Craig Todd, 19, who ate a trifle at a friend's house that included ground almonds; and Lucie Crawford, 13, who didn't realise that her portion of chips and curry sauce contained peanut butter. \"She was effectively poisoned,\" her heartbroken father told the papers. \"She might as well have been bitten by a rattlesnake.\"</p> <p>The list goes on: each victim killed by food that, to most of us, would be utterly innocuous. Whoever thought that lemon-meringue pie or trifle could kill you? Many of them were aware that they were allergic, but had little idea that their lives were in such grave danger as they'd suffered only mild reactions before. Then, last year, there was vivid illustration of the potential severity of nut allergies when international hurdler, Ross Baillie, 21, one of Britain's most promising athletes, died after eating a coronation chicken sandwich. Here was a young man, strong, healthy and at the peak of his fitness, yet still he died.</p> <p>It is impossible to know exactly how many people die of anaphylactic shock every year - estimates put it somewhere around six, eight, possibly 10. It's a tiny number when you consider that as many as one in 200 children may be allergic to peanuts, and that at least half of them are at risk of a severe reaction. But there is concern that some anaphylactic fatalities may be mistakenly blamed on asthma. Symptoms look very similar, and many nut-allergy sufferers are also asthmatic - indeed, that's what makes their allergy particularly deadly.</p> <p>Laura Thrasher's parents were told that their 18-year-old daughter, who was in her first week at Cambridge University, had died after a severe asthma attack at a freshers' dinner. They had no reason to suspect otherwise - Laura had a long history of asthma. But Laura also had a suspected allergy to nuts that had never been properly diagnosed: when she was about seven, she had been sick after eating a nut at a friend's house; on another occasion, she tasted one and her lips became slightly swollen. Her mother, Heather, mentioned it to the family doctor, and asked whether Laura should have tests, but was told that this was unnecessary and that the tests themselves could be dangerous. So Laura took it upon herself to avoid anything containing nuts, and they never really thought about it again. Until, that is, she ended up in intensive care on life support.</p> <p>It was a little less than two years ago, and it had been the happiest summer of their lives, says her mother, Heather, a PE teacher from Liverpool. \"Laura had applied to Cambridge. She got her offer: two As and a B. She got the grades she needed. Our son Ian had got good GCSEs. We got everything ready and took her down to Cambridge on the Saturday. She was studying economics. We settled her into her room. We went out for a meal on the Saturday night and on Sunday we went shopping, picking up odds and ends she needed.\"</p> <p>They said their goodbyes at about 2pm; Mr and Mrs Thrasher set off for Liverpool, and Laura began to find her feet at St Catharine's. The next day, she called her mother to say it was all going brilliantly; she had settled in, she was making friends, they had been shopping for clothes and she was looking forward - with some trepidation - to the formal freshers' dinner that night. It was the last time the Thrashers heard from their daughter.</p> <p>Later that evening, they were called by one of the dons who said that Laura had gone to hospital with what appeared to be an asthma attack. They rang the hospital and, after being passed from pillar to post, were told that their daughter had suffered a cardiac arrest and that there was little hope of a recovery. A friend drove them down to Cambridge. When they arrived, they were told that doctors had managed to revive her, but that she was gravely ill on life support.</p> <p>It transpired that Laura had been taken ill after eating a dessert that included a shortcake base containing nuts - whether peanuts or almonds is unclear. \"She must have taken one mouthful and realised there was something wrong,\" says her mother. \"If she'd been with us, she would have spat it out and that would have been that, but in the situation she was in - at a formal dinner, with people she didn't really know - it was difficult. Whether she swallowed it we don't know. She then had to sit through coffee. At the end, she went to her room and was sick.\" Laura struggled down to the telephone and called her boyfriend back in Liverpool. She told him she didn't feel well; she thought it was something she had eaten. He told her to get help, but it was too late.</p> <p>Laura remained on life support for three days, but tests showed that she was brain dead. Her organs were donated; the cause of death was given as asthma. And that would have been that had a friend not called the hospital to ask if Laura had eaten nuts. Blood tests confirmed her nut allergy; inquiries to the caterers provided the cause. \"At the time, we wondered how many deaths are put down to asthma,\" says Heather. \"If we had never questioned it, it would never have come up. She had such a brilliant future ahead of her. She never failed at anything. She threw herself into her work, and she enjoyed herself. She used to go out clubbing - coming back at three or four in the morning. She lived a full life in those 18 years. There were not any regrets. But just think what was ahead - and what she could have done. I know everyone says that their daughter is special. But she did have something. She would have landed an incredible job. She would have, I know she would have.\"</p> <p>The Thrashers' biggest regret is that they didn't push for their daughter to be tested when they first suspected she had an allergy, because, had she been tested, the chances are she would have been prescribed an emergency adrenaline injection called an EpiPen, which might have saved her life. Severe allergy sufferers are advised to carry an EpiPen at all times - even if they're just walking down to the postbox at the end of the road - so that, if they feel an attack coming on, they can inject themselves at once. The adrenaline works directly on the heart and lungs to reverse the fatal effects of anaphylaxis; it relieves symptoms and can give sufferers precious time to get to hospital for emergency treatment.</p> <p>Most people don't die of their nut allergy. Most people live with it. They learn to cope with the risk it carries and to navigate the dangers. And because of the sheer numbers of people developing the allergy, the world is slowly adapting to make life a little bit safer for them. Food labelling includes warnings about nuts; schools are becoming nut-free zones; airlines are banning peanut snacks during flights (with good reason - if peanuts are being eaten by a passenger at one end of the plane, someone with an allergy at the other end may have a reaction after inhaling the dust circulated in the cabin). For a parent, however, the fear remains - a moment of forgetfulness at a children's party, an oversight in a restaurant, a slip-up on a food-production line, and their child's life hangs by a thread.</p> <p>The first few months after a child is diagnosed with a nut allergy are nothing short of terrifying. Food ceases to be a source of pleasure. It is no longer spontaneous, it is no longer a source of relaxation. It is a matter of life and death. Suddenly, it's not about experimenting, getting your child to try new tastes and experiences. It's about getting them to stick to what they know. Food shopping - armed with Sainsbury's nut-free list, a bible for nut-allergy sufferers, but an awkward, unwieldy booklet that falls apart after a few outings - takes twice as long as it used to: reading labels tests even the best eyesight, as manufacturers pitch you into a game as dangerous as Russian roulette. For nuts, once regarded a Christmas luxury, are now as common as refined sugar, and can crop up in the most unexpected places with an inconsistency designed for disaster.</p> <p>Take Ragu tomato sauce: some jars carry warnings of nut traces, others don't. Why on earth should there be nuts in a tomato pasta sauce? Well, there shouldn't. It's just that some jars are made on the same production line as satay sauce and might be contaminated by nuts; others are made on a nut-free line. Then there are Smarties: in a tube, they are nut-free, but Mini Smarties \"may contain a nut trace\". Tesco's custard \"may contain\" traces of nuts, as might its chicken-and-smoked-ham sandwich, its vegetable lasagne and its golden savoury rice. Bob The Builder party cake, which once carried the label \"suitable for nut allergy sufferers\", became unsuitable because it moved to a production line used to make a marzipan product. Even Pears' soap - pure, fragrant Pears, ever associated with bonny, curly-haired children - contains an ingredient derived from peanuts.</p> <p>But while food labelling has in one way been an enormous help, the defensive labelling strategy adopted by most manufacturers and supermarkets can be hugely restrictive. Literally thousands of products carry \"may contain traces of nut\" warnings, though most will be safe for nut-allergy sufferers to eat. Rather than ensuring that production lines are entirely safe for consumers with a nut allergy, manufacturers cover themselves in case of cross-contamination. Research has shown that almost all teenagers ignore \"may contain\" warnings, believing the risk to be minimal. \"They think it's just fat cats covering their backs,\" says David Reading, director of the Anaphylaxis Campaign. \"But one day I'm sure something dreadful will happen.\"</p> <p>A small number of firms have gone to extraordinary lengths to prevent nut products in their factories contaminating their nut-free goods. Kinnerton, for example, which makes novelty chocolates, invested \u00a31 million to segregate its factory and establish a reliably nut-free zone. Workers there are allowed to communicate to those in the nut area only by mobile phone. Everything from clothing to Sellotape holders is colour-coded, to avoid cross-contamination, and the air-conditioning system is designed so that clean air enters through the nut-free area and exits via the nut-contaminated zone. According to managing director Clive Beecham, the costly modifications were carried out \"on moral grounds\"- he felt it was unacceptable to be making chocolates aimed at children in an environment that could kill them. \"But it's also defensive commercialism,\" he admits. \"I lived in fear of some poor child picking up one of our contaminated products and having a bad reaction, and it being featured on some consumer watchdog programme. You would get product withdrawals all over the place, and you wouldn't get back onto the shelves easily again.\"</p> <p>Has Kinnerton's nut-free guarantee proved commercially successful? Beecham reports a marginal pick-up in sales, but nothing significant. So, supermarkets are buying Kinnerton products regardless - not because - of its nut-free policy. \"It's not a major decision-making criterion,\" says Beecham. \"It will only become so if someone dies. Then it would be top of everyone's agenda.\"</p> <p>Fiona Ruffman has learned to negotiate the vagaries of modern food production. She discovered that her son, Alexander, had a nut allergy when he was nine months old. \"He was just in his babywalker. His big sister was having peanut butter toast. She gave him a lick - just a tiny lick. I turned round and could see his whole neck was up in swollen weals. Then his face started to swell up and his lips. He just looked as if he had been beaten up.\" Fiona, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, knew instantly what it was because a friend had recently died after eating a Chinese meal that contained nuts. (Eating out always carries an increased risk of such an allergic reaction, but Chinese and Indian meals are particularly hazardous because of the ingredients commonly used.)</p> <p>Alexander is now a strapping six-year-old, and he and his family have learned to live with his allergy without it dominating family life. He carries his EpiPens with him all the time; if he goes to play with friends, he always checks that the food has not got nuts in it, and at school the parents have been asked to make sure they do not put peanut butter sandwiches in their children's packed lunches.</p> <p>Not all schools have been so co-operative. Staff elsewhere have refused to administer EpiPens, so parents have been forced to sit with their children at critical times, in case of an allergic attack. Other nurseries, play-centres and summer play schemes have denied places to children with severe nut allergies because they do not have adequate insurance cover. \"It's getting the balance right,\" says Fiona. \"You can never be too careful with something like this, but you don't want to overburden the child. I still do feel frightened for him. I don't think it ever goes away. He's such a big, healthy-looking chap, you just can't believe it could happen. It's probably when he's older that I shall worry most. It's when they're with their friends, and they don't want to look different or silly. If you've had a few drinks and they say, 'Let's go for a curry.' That's what's really worrying.\"</p> <p>Hannah Wilks is already facing those dilemmas. She's 17, and discovered she had an allergy to brazil nuts about five years ago, after eating them in ice cream at a friend's house. Since then, she has managed to lead a virtually normal life, going out with friends and travelling abroad. The next big step will be going to university, where the risks multiply - alcohol, the student-union bar, no parents around to nag you to keep your EpiPen with you. A heady, fearful mix of cheap booze, new-found freedom and that peculiarly teenage sense of utter invincibility.</p> <p>In one way, Hannah is luckier than most. Whereas the majority of children discover their allergy very early in life and can quickly forget how ill they felt, Hannah remembers it vividly. \"The minute I ate the nut, I felt this strange tingling in my lips, in my mouth, in my throat. Over the next couple of hours, I started to feel quite sick. I developed a rash all over my body, big hives which were very itchy. One hour after that, when we were driving home, I had this tickle in my throat. I felt I was having trouble breathing. I was wheezing. My breath was coming in big gasps. I started to think that maybe soon I would not be able to breath at all. I had some sense that my life was in danger.\" Hannah went to hospital, she was put on a nebuliser and given anti-histamine, her breathing stabilised and she has not had an attack since.</p> <p>\"I don't want to feel I'm an extra worry for everybody. I'm coming to the understanding that it's just something that I have. It doesn't make me a victim or a nuisance. It's just something that happens and can be dealt with.\"</p> <p>Her mother, Teresa, is coming to terms with handing over responsibility to her daughter: \"I can't be there all the time. At the end of the day, you have to feel, well, I've done everything I can. She went through a stage - the first two or three years after she found out about it - when I discovered she was not telling people. She would go to friends' houses for a party. I would say, 'Does so and so's mum know about your allergy.' She'd say, 'Oh yes.' As a precaution, I would ring and, of course, they wouldn't know anything about it. With teenage girls, they've got enough issues with food to deal with. I can't say that it hasn't affected her emotionally. With a teenager it's difficult to sort out where the anxieties are coming from. But you don't want to make her feel that food is harmful or unhealthy or poisonous. I want Hannah to have a balanced view of food. It's a pleasure. Our social lives revolve around it.\"</p> <p>Severe nut allergies are considered a relatively new phenomenon, yet Hazel Gowland has lived with hers for almost 40 years. \"As a child I was exceptional. It was a bit of a joke: a child called Hazel who was allergic to nuts. But if you avoided Christmas and Easter, you didn't come across nuts very much in the way that you do now. We were creatures of habit then. Food was predictable. In my school canteen, no one would ever have thought of putting nuts in anything. My chances of coming across nuts were much smaller. Nowadays, it's much more difficult. If you look at what our kids eat compared with what we used to eat - they have a huge variety of things.\"</p> <p>Which is part of the joy of eating today, but also part of the increased risk. At children's birthday parties in the 60s, we might have had a couple of cheese sandwiches, jelly, ice cream and a home-made cake; at today's parties, children are faced with a glittering variety of factory-produced cakes, biscuits, sweets and snacks - many of which will contain nut traces, as well as other ingredients that were unheard of 30 years ago.</p> <p>Could this increased exposure to nuts be part of the reason for the dramatic rise in such allergies? No one seems to know conclusively, but, according to the dominant school of thought today, children may be becoming increasingly sensitive after encountering peanut proteins in the womb as a result of the mother eating nuts during pregnancy, or through breast milk. Indeed, the Department of Health advises mothers with asthma, eczema, hayfever or other allergies in the family to avoid nut, particularly peanut, products during pregnancy and breastfeeding, to limit the risk of their child developing a nut allergy.</p> <p>Such advice is not, however, endorsed by everyone. According to Dr Gideon Lack, who specialises in paediatric allergies at St Mary's Hospital, London, there is no evidence to support it. \"If you look at studies of interventional diets, where mothers have had to avoid commonly allergenic foods during the last trimester of pregnancy and during breastfeeding, there's no data to show that these children develop less allergy to these foods. At the moment, I don't believe we have enough information on which foods to ban from mothers' and children's diets. Children should not eat peanuts and nuts because they can choke on them. There's no evidence that it's harmful for a one-year-old to eat peanut butter.\"</p> <p>The world of allergies is riven by anomalies and inconsistencies. Some experts say we're developing nut allergies in this country because children are being exposed to nuts too much and too early. Yet in areas of the world such as south-east Asia, where nut consumption is extremely high, there is a very low incidence of nut and peanut allergies. \"Whether it is because people are eating more and it is protecting them against allergy is debatable,\" says Lack. \"It may be that different levels of exposure result in either tolerance to a food or allergy to that food. I do not think we can offer evidence-based advice about dietary measures, as we do not have sufficient knowledge. We would like to believe that we can prevent food allergies, but at the moment we do not have the necessary understanding.\"</p> <p>What is agreed is that the increase in the number of people with nut allergies is part of a much wider increase in allergies and asthma in this country and elsewhere in the western world. More than half of British adults and one in three children now suffer from allergies. According to Lack, one of the most attractive theories to explain this dramatic rise is the hygiene hypothesis. Exposure to bacteria and bacterial toxins at an early age, it seems, may help shape a child's immunity into the normal non-allergic mode. Without that exposure, allergies are more likely to develop when the immune system encounters food proteins.</p> <p>\"We have become sanitised over the past 30-50 years, with modern living conditions that are quite different from those of our ancestors,\" he says. \"Refrigeration of food, improved hygiene and rigorous standards in the food industry prevent gastro-intestinal infections that used to be far more common in children. In non-westernised environments, where there is a lot more early childhood infection and poor sanitation, children do not develop asthma and allergies to the same extent. If there is a failure of the immune system early on to be exposed to certain bacterial products, by default it will be directed towards an allergic response, according to this theory.\"</p> <p>For young people such as Alexander Ruffman and Hannah Wilks, their best hope, apart from constant vigilance, lies in the development of a vaccine to prevent potentially deadly allergic reactions, and it may not be so very far off. US researchers are studying two different ways of blocking food-allergic reactions. The first attempts to eliminate altogether the IgE molecules that cause allergic reactions from the body; the second tries to switch off the IgE antibodies to a specific protein. It is the protein element of nuts that causes an allergic reaction. Preliminary results are encouraging, but it is not going to happen overnight.</p> <p>Lack believes that there will be vaccine trials underway in the next five years. In the meantime, allergy clinics are snowed under with new referrals; terrified parents are put on ever-lengthening waiting lists - in some areas of Scotland, you may have to wait three years or more; and their children's lives are restricted by their parents' fear of a serious reaction. Childhood allergies are one of the largest public-health problems in this country, yet there are fewer than a handful of specialist centres to deal with it. There is a lack of education about allergy in medical schools, a lack of training and a scandalous misconception that allergies are somehow not very serious.</p> <p>\"Allergy is seen as a pseudo-disease that belongs to the middle classes, and doesn't have a place in medical literature but in glossy magazines,\" says one allergy specialist who did not wish to be named. \"There's no national framework for the provision of paediatric allergy services in this country. There's been no planning for that whatsoever. It's scandalous and disgraceful. There's a general feeling that we must deal with cancer and heart disease -those are real diseases. Allergy isn't seen as a disease.\"</p> <p>Yet recent research has shown that the quality of life for children with peanut allergy is as impaired as that for children with chronic rheumatological diseases - the limitations on eating out and foreign travel; not being able to go to parties or on school trips; having to eat different foods; always having to worry about what you're eating.</p> <p>Of course, there are worse things in life than being unable to eat a Snoopy dog birthday cake like the rest of your classmates - though try telling that to a disconsolate five-year-old. He can't understand how much danger he's in; he doesn't know a slice of cake could mean the difference between living and dying. All he knows is that he's singled out, he's different, and that his mum and dad worry about him more than is good for them</p>",

      "bodyText": "This boy is perfect. He is healthy and strong. He has a wide smile, a chipped tooth and floppy, dark blond hair. His limbs are strong and fleshy - his belly sticks out above his trouser-belt. His shins are scuffed and bruised, his fingernails are dirty. He is beautiful. He's perfect. This boy is noisy and bold. He shouts at the top of his voice - at all times. He jumps up and down with excitement when he's happy. He's got a tender little scar on the right-hand side of his forehead. He picks his nose and slips a slimy finger into his mouth when he thinks you're not looking. This boy is happy. He's healthy. He's lovely. But this boy is booby-trapped. Somewhere inside his sturdy five-year-old body, there's a tripwire that is every bit as deadly as a terrorist bomb - it's primed and ready to blow. Trigger it, and within minutes his life is in danger. This boy has an allergy - not the sort that gives you itchy eyes, or a runny nose, or a bloated feeling in your stomach for an hour or two. It's the sort that can kill. He is one of a growing number of children who are allergic to nuts - it might be walnuts or brazil nuts, hazelnuts, cashews or almonds. But it is the peanut - not really a nut at all, strictly speaking, but a member of the legume family - that is most hazardous. Strange, isn't it? Nuts. Natural, ancient foods that sustained our hunter-gatherer ancestors. The sort of food we all thought was good for us - a healthy alternative to today's sugar-drenched, polystyrene-packed, processed-to-the-point-of-annihilation foods. For most of us, nuts - rich in energy and nutrients - are still the healthy alternative, but to this child they are as lethal as cyanide. Even if he eats the most minuscule amount, even if he simply inhales the papery dust that puffs out of tens of thousands of packets of peanuts in pubs up and down the country every day, he may become dangerously ill. First, his lips swell like party balloons, then a rash of knobbly hives flush up over his body; his skin goes blotchy, then he might start wheezing and coughing. His tongue might start swelling, his tubes may become constricted - he may start to suffocate and his blood pressure might plummet. He may collapse, lose consciousness and die. It's called anaphylactic shock, and it's a million miles from the popular idea of allergy as minor irritation or hypochondriacal delusion - a deadly riposte to voguish, smart-arse headlines such as \"Allergy - is it all in the mind?\" All parents worry about their children. We live our lives in a near-constant state of anxiety. We read about an outbreak of meningitis in Devon and instantly we're frightened that our child will get it, even though we live in Dundee; a little girl is abducted and killed, and we're suddenly terrified to let ours go to the corner shop; we worry about them being mown down on the roads; about drugs and dropping out, bullying, suicide and teenage pregnancy. Some of our fears are more real and rational than others, but the chances are most of them will never happen to you or your child. Chances are, he or she will grow up to be a strong, healthy adult with his or her own children to worry about. Even when you're worrying yourself sick about them, that's part of the equation: part of you subconsciously rationalises that most children will make it safely through to adulthood, despite all the risks along the way; yes, terrible things do happen, but they're more likely not to. So it's peculiar, having spent one's life worrying about dread and dire events that are extremely unlikely to happen, to be told that your child has a potentially fatal allergy to nuts. It's not an illness, it's not something you can see - yet your child can be perfectly healthy one minute and in intensive care the next. If he doesn't eat nuts, he will be fine; should he eat nuts, he may die. Suddenly, you have something very real to be afraid of. Life-threatening nut allergies have been recognised only fairly recently. In the cuttings file, little more than a sad roll-call of those who have died, the earliest article dates back to May 1990. It is a single paragraph: \"Peanuts can prove fatal to people who are allergic to them, chest specialists at University College Hospital, London, warn today after the deaths of two men who ate peanuts contained in a satay sauce and in a meal thought to be free of nuts.\" From that point on, the articles make for sobering reading - many of those who have died are teenagers, their deaths sudden, bizarre and shattering for all who knew them. Youngsters such as Michaela Mortimer, 16, who died minutes after eating her school lunch - a wafer she had for dessert contained peanuts; Josephine Turner, 17, who ate a peanut-filled pretzel at a cocktail party; Sarah Reading, 17, who ate a slice of lemon meringue pie that contained crushed peanuts; Craig Todd, 19, who ate a trifle at a friend's house that included ground almonds; and Lucie Crawford, 13, who didn't realise that her portion of chips and curry sauce contained peanut butter. \"She was effectively poisoned,\" her heartbroken father told the papers. \"She might as well have been bitten by a rattlesnake.\" The list goes on: each victim killed by food that, to most of us, would be utterly innocuous. Whoever thought that lemon-meringue pie or trifle could kill you? Many of them were aware that they were allergic, but had little idea that their lives were in such grave danger as they'd suffered only mild reactions before. Then, last year, there was vivid illustration of the potential severity of nut allergies when international hurdler, Ross Baillie, 21, one of Britain's most promising athletes, died after eating a coronation chicken sandwich. Here was a young man, strong, healthy and at the peak of his fitness, yet still he died. It is impossible to know exactly how many people die of anaphylactic shock every year - estimates put it somewhere around six, eight, possibly 10. It's a tiny number when you consider that as many as one in 200 children may be allergic to peanuts, and that at least half of them are at risk of a severe reaction. But there is concern that some anaphylactic fatalities may be mistakenly blamed on asthma. Symptoms look very similar, and many nut-allergy sufferers are also asthmatic - indeed, that's what makes their allergy particularly deadly. Laura Thrasher's parents were told that their 18-year-old daughter, who was in her first week at Cambridge University, had died after a severe asthma attack at a freshers' dinner. They had no reason to suspect otherwise - Laura had a long history of asthma. But Laura also had a suspected allergy to nuts that had never been properly diagnosed: when she was about seven, she had been sick after eating a nut at a friend's house; on another occasion, she tasted one and her lips became slightly swollen. Her mother, Heather, mentioned it to the family doctor, and asked whether Laura should have tests, but was told that this was unnecessary and that the tests themselves could be dangerous. So Laura took it upon herself to avoid anything containing nuts, and they never really thought about it again. Until, that is, she ended up in intensive care on life support. It was a little less than two years ago, and it had been the happiest summer of their lives, says her mother, Heather, a PE teacher from Liverpool. \"Laura had applied to Cambridge. She got her offer: two As and a B. She got the grades she needed. Our son Ian had got good GCSEs. We got everything ready and took her down to Cambridge on the Saturday. She was studying economics. We settled her into her room. We went out for a meal on the Saturday night and on Sunday we went shopping, picking up odds and ends she needed.\" They said their goodbyes at about 2pm; Mr and Mrs Thrasher set off for Liverpool, and Laura began to find her feet at St Catharine's. The next day, she called her mother to say it was all going brilliantly; she had settled in, she was making friends, they had been shopping for clothes and she was looking forward - with some trepidation - to the formal freshers' dinner that night. It was the last time the Thrashers heard from their daughter. Later that evening, they were called by one of the dons who said that Laura had gone to hospital with what appeared to be an asthma attack. They rang the hospital and, after being passed from pillar to post, were told that their daughter had suffered a cardiac arrest and that there was little hope of a recovery. A friend drove them down to Cambridge. When they arrived, they were told that doctors had managed to revive her, but that she was gravely ill on life support. It transpired that Laura had been taken ill after eating a dessert that included a shortcake base containing nuts - whether peanuts or almonds is unclear. \"She must have taken one mouthful and realised there was something wrong,\" says her mother. \"If she'd been with us, she would have spat it out and that would have been that, but in the situation she was in - at a formal dinner, with people she didn't really know - it was difficult. Whether she swallowed it we don't know. She then had to sit through coffee. At the end, she went to her room and was sick.\" Laura struggled down to the telephone and called her boyfriend back in Liverpool. She told him she didn't feel well; she thought it was something she had eaten. He told her to get help, but it was too late. Laura remained on life support for three days, but tests showed that she was brain dead. Her organs were donated; the cause of death was given as asthma. And that would have been that had a friend not called the hospital to ask if Laura had eaten nuts. Blood tests confirmed her nut allergy; inquiries to the caterers provided the cause. \"At the time, we wondered how many deaths are put down to asthma,\" says Heather. \"If we had never questioned it, it would never have come up. She had such a brilliant future ahead of her. She never failed at anything. She threw herself into her work, and she enjoyed herself. She used to go out clubbing - coming back at three or four in the morning. She lived a full life in those 18 years. There were not any regrets. But just think what was ahead - and what she could have done. I know everyone says that their daughter is special. But she did have something. She would have landed an incredible job. She would have, I know she would have.\" The Thrashers' biggest regret is that they didn't push for their daughter to be tested when they first suspected she had an allergy, because, had she been tested, the chances are she would have been prescribed an emergency adrenaline injection called an EpiPen, which might have saved her life. Severe allergy sufferers are advised to carry an EpiPen at all times - even if they're just walking down to the postbox at the end of the road - so that, if they feel an attack coming on, they can inject themselves at once. The adrenaline works directly on the heart and lungs to reverse the fatal effects of anaphylaxis; it relieves symptoms and can give sufferers precious time to get to hospital for emergency treatment. Most people don't die of their nut allergy. Most people live with it. They learn to cope with the risk it carries and to navigate the dangers. And because of the sheer numbers of people developing the allergy, the world is slowly adapting to make life a little bit safer for them. Food labelling includes warnings about nuts; schools are becoming nut-free zones; airlines are banning peanut snacks during flights (with good reason - if peanuts are being eaten by a passenger at one end of the plane, someone with an allergy at the other end may have a reaction after inhaling the dust circulated in the cabin). For a parent, however, the fear remains - a moment of forgetfulness at a children's party, an oversight in a restaurant, a slip-up on a food-production line, and their child's life hangs by a thread. The first few months after a child is diagnosed with a nut allergy are nothing short of terrifying. Food ceases to be a source of pleasure. It is no longer spontaneous, it is no longer a source of relaxation. It is a matter of life and death. Suddenly, it's not about experimenting, getting your child to try new tastes and experiences. It's about getting them to stick to what they know. Food shopping - armed with Sainsbury's nut-free list, a bible for nut-allergy sufferers, but an awkward, unwieldy booklet that falls apart after a few outings - takes twice as long as it used to: reading labels tests even the best eyesight, as manufacturers pitch you into a game as dangerous as Russian roulette. For nuts, once regarded a Christmas luxury, are now as common as refined sugar, and can crop up in the most unexpected places with an inconsistency designed for disaster. Take Ragu tomato sauce: some jars carry warnings of nut traces, others don't. Why on earth should there be nuts in a tomato pasta sauce? Well, there shouldn't. It's just that some jars are made on the same production line as satay sauce and might be contaminated by nuts; others are made on a nut-free line. Then there are Smarties: in a tube, they are nut-free, but Mini Smarties \"may contain a nut trace\". Tesco's custard \"may contain\" traces of nuts, as might its chicken-and-smoked-ham sandwich, its vegetable lasagne and its golden savoury rice. Bob The Builder party cake, which once carried the label \"suitable for nut allergy sufferers\", became unsuitable because it moved to a production line used to make a marzipan product. Even Pears' soap - pure, fragrant Pears, ever associated with bonny, curly-haired children - contains an ingredient derived from peanuts. But while food labelling has in one way been an enormous help, the defensive labelling strategy adopted by most manufacturers and supermarkets can be hugely restrictive. Literally thousands of products carry \"may contain traces of nut\" warnings, though most will be safe for nut-allergy sufferers to eat. Rather than ensuring that production lines are entirely safe for consumers with a nut allergy, manufacturers cover themselves in case of cross-contamination. Research has shown that almost all teenagers ignore \"may contain\" warnings, believing the risk to be minimal. \"They think it's just fat cats covering their backs,\" says David Reading, director of the Anaphylaxis Campaign. \"But one day I'm sure something dreadful will happen.\" A small number of firms have gone to extraordinary lengths to prevent nut products in their factories contaminating their nut-free goods. Kinnerton, for example, which makes novelty chocolates, invested \u00a31 million to segregate its factory and establish a reliably nut-free zone. Workers there are allowed to communicate to those in the nut area only by mobile phone. Everything from clothing to Sellotape holders is colour-coded, to avoid cross-contamination, and the air-conditioning system is designed so that clean air enters through the nut-free area and exits via the nut-contaminated zone. According to managing director Clive Beecham, the costly modifications were carried out \"on moral grounds\"- he felt it was unacceptable to be making chocolates aimed at children in an environment that could kill them. \"But it's also defensive commercialism,\" he admits. \"I lived in fear of some poor child picking up one of our contaminated products and having a bad reaction, and it being featured on some consumer watchdog programme. You would get product withdrawals all over the place, and you wouldn't get back onto the shelves easily again.\" Has Kinnerton's nut-free guarantee proved commercially successful? Beecham reports a marginal pick-up in sales, but nothing significant. So, supermarkets are buying Kinnerton products regardless - not because - of its nut-free policy. \"It's not a major decision-making criterion,\" says Beecham. \"It will only become so if someone dies. Then it would be top of everyone's agenda.\" Fiona Ruffman has learned to negotiate the vagaries of modern food production. She discovered that her son, Alexander, had a nut allergy when he was nine months old. \"He was just in his babywalker. His big sister was having peanut butter toast. She gave him a lick - just a tiny lick. I turned round and could see his whole neck was up in swollen weals. Then his face started to swell up and his lips. He just looked as if he had been beaten up.\" Fiona, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, knew instantly what it was because a friend had recently died after eating a Chinese meal that contained nuts. (Eating out always carries an increased risk of such an allergic reaction, but Chinese and Indian meals are particularly hazardous because of the ingredients commonly used.) Alexander is now a strapping six-year-old, and he and his family have learned to live with his allergy without it dominating family life. He carries his EpiPens with him all the time; if he goes to play with friends, he always checks that the food has not got nuts in it, and at school the parents have been asked to make sure they do not put peanut butter sandwiches in their children's packed lunches. Not all schools have been so co-operative. Staff elsewhere have refused to administer EpiPens, so parents have been forced to sit with their children at critical times, in case of an allergic attack. Other nurseries, play-centres and summer play schemes have denied places to children with severe nut allergies because they do not have adequate insurance cover. \"It's getting the balance right,\" says Fiona. \"You can never be too careful with something like this, but you don't want to overburden the child. I still do feel frightened for him. I don't think it ever goes away. He's such a big, healthy-looking chap, you just can't believe it could happen. It's probably when he's older that I shall worry most. It's when they're with their friends, and they don't want to look different or silly. If you've had a few drinks and they say, 'Let's go for a curry.' That's what's really worrying.\" Hannah Wilks is already facing those dilemmas. She's 17, and discovered she had an allergy to brazil nuts about five years ago, after eating them in ice cream at a friend's house. Since then, she has managed to lead a virtually normal life, going out with friends and travelling abroad. The next big step will be going to university, where the risks multiply - alcohol, the student-union bar, no parents around to nag you to keep your EpiPen with you. A heady, fearful mix of cheap booze, new-found freedom and that peculiarly teenage sense of utter invincibility. In one way, Hannah is luckier than most. Whereas the majority of children discover their allergy very early in life and can quickly forget how ill they felt, Hannah remembers it vividly. \"The minute I ate the nut, I felt this strange tingling in my lips, in my mouth, in my throat. Over the next couple of hours, I started to feel quite sick. I developed a rash all over my body, big hives which were very itchy. One hour after that, when we were driving home, I had this tickle in my throat. I felt I was having trouble breathing. I was wheezing. My breath was coming in big gasps. I started to think that maybe soon I would not be able to breath at all. I had some sense that my life was in danger.\" Hannah went to hospital, she was put on a nebuliser and given anti-histamine, her breathing stabilised and she has not had an attack since. \"I don't want to feel I'm an extra worry for everybody. I'm coming to the understanding that it's just something that I have. It doesn't make me a victim or a nuisance. It's just something that happens and can be dealt with.\" Her mother, Teresa, is coming to terms with handing over responsibility to her daughter: \"I can't be there all the time. At the end of the day, you have to feel, well, I've done everything I can. She went through a stage - the first two or three years after she found out about it - when I discovered she was not telling people. She would go to friends' houses for a party. I would say, 'Does so and so's mum know about your allergy.' She'd say, 'Oh yes.' As a precaution, I would ring and, of course, they wouldn't know anything about it. With teenage girls, they've got enough issues with food to deal with. I can't say that it hasn't affected her emotionally. With a teenager it's difficult to sort out where the anxieties are coming from. But you don't want to make her feel that food is harmful or unhealthy or poisonous. I want Hannah to have a balanced view of food. It's a pleasure. Our social lives revolve around it.\" Severe nut allergies are considered a relatively new phenomenon, yet Hazel Gowland has lived with hers for almost 40 years. \"As a child I was exceptional. It was a bit of a joke: a child called Hazel who was allergic to nuts. But if you avoided Christmas and Easter, you didn't come across nuts very much in the way that you do now. We were creatures of habit then. Food was predictable. In my school canteen, no one would ever have thought of putting nuts in anything. My chances of coming across nuts were much smaller. Nowadays, it's much more difficult. If you look at what our kids eat compared with what we used to eat - they have a huge variety of things.\" Which is part of the joy of eating today, but also part of the increased risk. At children's birthday parties in the 60s, we might have had a couple of cheese sandwiches, jelly, ice cream and a home-made cake; at today's parties, children are faced with a glittering variety of factory-produced cakes, biscuits, sweets and snacks - many of which will contain nut traces, as well as other ingredients that were unheard of 30 years ago. Could this increased exposure to nuts be part of the reason for the dramatic rise in such allergies? No one seems to know conclusively, but, according to the dominant school of thought today, children may be becoming increasingly sensitive after encountering peanut proteins in the womb as a result of the mother eating nuts during pregnancy, or through breast milk. Indeed, the Department of Health advises mothers with asthma, eczema, hayfever or other allergies in the family to avoid nut, particularly peanut, products during pregnancy and breastfeeding, to limit the risk of their child developing a nut allergy. Such advice is not, however, endorsed by everyone. According to Dr Gideon Lack, who specialises in paediatric allergies at St Mary's Hospital, London, there is no evidence to support it. \"If you look at studies of interventional diets, where mothers have had to avoid commonly allergenic foods during the last trimester of pregnancy and during breastfeeding, there's no data to show that these children develop less allergy to these foods. At the moment, I don't believe we have enough information on which foods to ban from mothers' and children's diets. Children should not eat peanuts and nuts because they can choke on them. There's no evidence that it's harmful for a one-year-old to eat peanut butter.\" The world of allergies is riven by anomalies and inconsistencies. Some experts say we're developing nut allergies in this country because children are being exposed to nuts too much and too early. Yet in areas of the world such as south-east Asia, where nut consumption is extremely high, there is a very low incidence of nut and peanut allergies. \"Whether it is because people are eating more and it is protecting them against allergy is debatable,\" says Lack. \"It may be that different levels of exposure result in either tolerance to a food or allergy to that food. I do not think we can offer evidence-based advice about dietary measures, as we do not have sufficient knowledge. We would like to believe that we can prevent food allergies, but at the moment we do not have the necessary understanding.\" What is agreed is that the increase in the number of people with nut allergies is part of a much wider increase in allergies and asthma in this country and elsewhere in the western world. More than half of British adults and one in three children now suffer from allergies. According to Lack, one of the most attractive theories to explain this dramatic rise is the hygiene hypothesis. Exposure to bacteria and bacterial toxins at an early age, it seems, may help shape a child's immunity into the normal non-allergic mode. Without that exposure, allergies are more likely to develop when the immune system encounters food proteins. \"We have become sanitised over the past 30-50 years, with modern living conditions that are quite different from those of our ancestors,\" he says. \"Refrigeration of food, improved hygiene and rigorous standards in the food industry prevent gastro-intestinal infections that used to be far more common in children. In non-westernised environments, where there is a lot more early childhood infection and poor sanitation, children do not develop asthma and allergies to the same extent. If there is a failure of the immune system early on to be exposed to certain bacterial products, by default it will be directed towards an allergic response, according to this theory.\" For young people such as Alexander Ruffman and Hannah Wilks, their best hope, apart from constant vigilance, lies in the development of a vaccine to prevent potentially deadly allergic reactions, and it may not be so very far off. US researchers are studying two different ways of blocking food-allergic reactions. The first attempts to eliminate altogether the IgE molecules that cause allergic reactions from the body; the second tries to switch off the IgE antibodies to a specific protein. It is the protein element of nuts that causes an allergic reaction. Preliminary results are encouraging, but it is not going to happen overnight. Lack believes that there will be vaccine trials underway in the next five years. In the meantime, allergy clinics are snowed under with new referrals; terrified parents are put on ever-lengthening waiting lists - in some areas of Scotland, you may have to wait three years or more; and their children's lives are restricted by their parents' fear of a serious reaction. Childhood allergies are one of the largest public-health problems in this country, yet there are fewer than a handful of specialist centres to deal with it. There is a lack of education about allergy in medical schools, a lack of training and a scandalous misconception that allergies are somehow not very serious. \"Allergy is seen as a pseudo-disease that belongs to the middle classes, and doesn't have a place in medical literature but in glossy magazines,\" says one allergy specialist who did not wish to be named. \"There's no national framework for the provision of paediatric allergy services in this country. There's been no planning for that whatsoever. It's scandalous and disgraceful. There's a general feeling that we must deal with cancer and heart disease -those are real diseases. Allergy isn't seen as a disease.\" Yet recent research has shown that the quality of life for children with peanut allergy is as impaired as that for children with chronic rheumatological diseases - the limitations on eating out and foreign travel; not being able to go to parties or on school trips; having to eat different foods; always having to worry about what you're eating. Of course, there are worse things in life than being unable to eat a Snoopy dog birthday cake like the rest of your classmates - though try telling that to a disconsolate five-year-old. He can't understand how much danger he's in; he doesn't know a slice of cake could mean the difference between living and dying. All he knows is that he's singled out, he's different, and that his mum and dad worry about him more than is good for them",

      "body": "<p>The first time it happened was in 1983. I know the year because it was one of the rare times in my adult life when I've been slim. I was living in a hot country and had discovered, to my surprise, that I enjoyed exercise. When I wasn't working in my part-time job at a vintage clothing store, I was working out in a gym or running or swimming. I lived on fruit shakes, cheap champagne and nuts. I was 26 years old. I had a tan. I had cheekbones. I wore 50s frocks with boat necks and shoes with pointy toes and my hair was cut in a sort of choppy bob. </p> <p>One evening, I was sitting on the balcony of a friend's flat, listening to the clinking of the boats in the marina below, when she turned to me and said, \"Do you know who you look like?\" </p> <p>\"No,\" I said, not at all sure that I wanted to hear the answer. </p> <p>\"Liz Taylor.\" </p> <p>I thought it was a cruel joke and told her so. But she insisted that she was serious. </p> <p>\"It's something to do with the end of your nose - the way it tilts up - and the shape of your face,\" she tried to explain. </p> <p>Not long after, I was given a postcard by someone in my office. It is possible that he had a crush on me. The photograph was of Liz with a suntan, a slightly rosy nose and a spray of tiny freckles on the sides of her cheeks. Her black hair is scraped back in a pink towel tied in a turban. She is in full maquillage - eyebrows darkened, eyeliner, mascara, and salmon lip-gloss. She is 33, but looks younger. My husband pinned it on the noticeboard in our kitchen. Friends would come in and do a double take. At first they assumed that it was me. Only after peering at it quite hard did they realise that they were mistaken. </p> <p>In an old diary, I keep some photographs of myself that were taken at that time. I look at them when I am feeling middle-aged and sad, to remind myself that I wasn't always this way. But, in truth, what they show is as unreal and duplicitous as a movie still. Most of them were taken at parties, with me wearing dresses from a more glamorous era: off-the-shoulder taffeta and chiffon and satin, diamant\u00e9 earrings dangling, eyes widened in surprise or half-closed, flirting with the camera. I can see, far more now than I did then, a faint resemblance to Liz - which is more to do with the retro look and the confidence of youth, which can pass for allure, than anything real. </p> <p>The last time it happened, I was interviewing a don on the banks of the Cam. I was 33 - the same age as the Liz on that postcard - with a two-year-old son, and was back living in a cold country. The don was a classicist who had written a book about surfing. We sat on the grass, drinking cups of tea, eating fragile cucumber sandwiches and talking about the mythology of the waves. I remember that I was wearing inappropriate shoes - black and spiky - and large sunglasses. Later, I was told that a colleague had asked him what he was doing on the lawn with Liz Taylor. I decided to take it as a compliment. Now that I'm 42, and closer to Liz in her kaftan years, no one says that I look like her any more. </p> <p>When I was eight, I saw Liz close up. My parents and I were staying in Cap Ferrat in the south of France, in a darkly lush winding road. Somerset Maugham lived in a neighbouring Gothic-looking mansion, and every time we passed it my mother would tell me that he had lived there with his male companion. </p> <p>I can't summon the names of any of the other hotels we stayed in when I was young and my parents used to travel in style. Villa de la Robia was different. There was a garden with lots of tangled undergrowth and chipped, mossy statues lurking in the gloom. I had a room to myself, which you reached from some crumbling steps that led up from the shadows of the garden. I used to lie in my bed with its odd, sausage-shaped pillow, the shutters closed, and imagine what it would be like to kiss my favourite handsome waiter. </p> <p>One lunchtime, the usual placid hush in the restaurant was disturbed by the arrival of a family. Heads studiously did not swivel, but there was a sudden brightness, a subtle animated charge in the muted chatter. I can still see Liz clearly. She was wearing Capri pants and a dark headscarf. There were two teenagers with her - a boy and a girl, who were strikingly good-looking with their black hair and violet-blue eyes framed by thick eyebrows - and a rather grey, craggy man who must have been Richard Burton. </p> <p>They were sitting at the next table, and my mother - who had her own movie-star glamour - was determinedly unimpressed. After lunch, over coffee on the veranda, she turned to my father and said, \"Rather a dumpy little thing, didn't you think?\" </p> <p>\"My God, darling,\" he replied, \"she's not a patch on you.\" </p> <p>Liz hasn't had a major role in a film for years. Unlike Katharine Hepburn or Lauren Bacall, age has withered her acting career. There have been no grand matriarch roles or twilight-year romances. No Golden Ponds. And because we have not grown accustomed to seeing her grow old in Technicolor celluloid, we still think of her as a screen goddess, frozen in the past. We are constantly reminded that she is alive - if only because of her frequent brushes with death: the brain tumour three years ago, the fall the following year - but the Liz who has worked so hard at raising funds for and the profile of Aids charities, who once said that Michael Jackson was the least weird man she knew, is someone quite separate from her youthful screen persona. In that sense, she occupies a unique space: one in which she is both alive and dead. </p> <p>There are not many actors, of either sex, who have become so iconic in their lifetime. Warhol favoured the dead over the living in his prints - JFK, Mao, Marilyn, Elvis. But he also placed Liz in this pantheon, as if acknowledging her not-of-this-world lustre, and fixed on her image, circa 1960, with the tousled hooker's hairdo she wore in Butterfield 8. </p> <p>She was always a star rather than an actress. A lot of her films were B-movies, which were somehow redeemed by her luminous sheen. It feels like I've always loved her, even though there's something unconcrete and dreamlike about the way I conjure her in my imagination. She is not like other actors I admire, in that I cannot point to this or that role to illustrate precisely what it is about her that I find so appealing. She doesn't have a set of mannerisms that help you to place her. There is no equivalent to the Clint glint or the Marilyn wiggle. But for me, it was enough that when she was in a film she had some quality that made it impossible for me to take my eyes off her. She seemed to fill the screen, eclipsing everyone around her. </p> <p>I always saw her films retrospectively, and this may partly explain why I view her through a special lens. She seems always to have been there in my childhood and adolescence, although I never actively sought her out. I saw her by chance: a Sunday movie on a rainy afternoon, or late at night when I was a student, or as part of some film festival of 50s kitsch. Like most people, I have absorbed the soap opera of her life - the multiple marriages, the accidents, the illnesses, the addictions, the sojourns in the Betty Ford clinic - but, in my case, as an unwilling participant. I'd rather not know about these details, since they detract from the image of her in my mind's eye. </p> <p>I haven't retained much of an impression of her in National Velvet, although if I blink I can see her in jodhpurs, her hair tied up with a bow, the beauty spot on her cheek - already too sophisticated to look like a real little girl who loved horses. I can visualise her more clearly in Jane Eyre, although she had a tiny part. She played Helen, the angelic child who befriends Jane in the orphanage and dies beautifully. I remember her dark eyes gazing out of an unearthly white face. She was, of course, too good to be true - and probably would have been better cast as one of Jane's nasty, spoiled relatives. But I loved her satiny voice and believed in her sweetness. </p> <p>The films that stand out for me are the ones in which she was a poor little rich girl. Or, sometimes, the beautiful rich bitch. They were all made between the early 50s and the mid-60s, when she was at her swooning loveliest. Watching her was like basking in the reflected glory of her shimmering youthfulness. When I look back at those films now, as a body of work, I am struck by how dark they were. There was often the suggestion of something corrupt about her beauty, that it was both damaged and damaging; a hint of moral decay behind the succulent peachiness. She is a siren of doom, driving the men around her to murder or self-destruction. I rather think it was this sickness behind the bloom that I liked. </p> <p>There was also a frisson - a sort of fag-haggy appeal - in acknowledging the relationship between her status as a gay icon and her friendships with her leading men, who tended to be homosexual: Montgomery Clift in A Place In The Sun and Suddenly Last Summer; Rock Hudson and James Dean in Giant. But I don't think I would have responded to Liz so viscerally if she had been merely camp. There is a dangerous undertow to these films; a sense in which some sort of malign energy, which both emanates from her and is beyond her control, is propelling the protagonists to their downfall. Her kind of brittle shallowness can kill. </p> <p>The film that sums up this quality for me is, oddly, not A Place In The Sun - in which the rich girl's new boyfriend drowns his discarded pregnant girlfriend, which might seem to fit the bill more neatly - but Suddenly Last Summer. It still strikes me as astonishing that such an overtly homosexual theme could have been tackled on the screen as early as 1959. Here, the sickness is almost tangible. Young Liz in her white bathing suit - the fleshy bait to lure penniless young beach boys into the arms of her homosexual cousin; his harridan mother (Katharine Hepburn) in her throne-like chair on the veranda ordering a lobotomy for her hysterical niece in order to obliterate the memory of what happened on the day her son died; the ending - even now it makes me shiver to recall it: the boys who had been preyed upon by the cousin chasing him up the hill, joined by other children on the way to the top, tearing his immaculate white suit to shreds, and then his flesh. </p> <p>There was a time, at the height of her stardom, when Liz's fans - in their eagerness to steal a part of her lustre for themselves - were in danger of ripping her apart. They would grab at her hair, her mink coats, her fabulous jewels. There was something about her appeal that was as universal as the strange kinship the public felt for Princess Diana. When Liz was taken to hospital with pneumonia in 1961 and was reported as being close to death, fans pulled their cars to the side of the road and prayed for her recovery. If Liz had died then, she would have become a Marilyn or a Princess Di. Like them, she was a goddess who could pull us into her orbit. Her battle with weight, her weaknesses for a bad man and a good frock, were our own little lives writ large. You could even forgive her ostentatious displays of wealth and her excessive habits, since they so evidently did not bring her happiness. It is a peculiar quirk of fame that such an untypical woman can also, at some level, be an Everywoman. </p> <p>When I started to write this piece, I was concerned that it might sound deranged to be exploring the idea that I felt a personal connection with Liz because someone once said that I bore a passing resemblance to her. I reminded myself of the old bag in a film I once saw, who thrust a photograph of Princess Diana in front of her hairdresser and announced, \"I want to look like that.\" But I have come across other women who also have been told that they look like Liz - and none of them looks like me. My children's middle-aged nanny - one of the old guard in a tweed skirt and sensible shoes - used to tell me that people said she had Liz Taylor's eyes. A former colleague, an alluring scruff with unkempt hair, was often persuaded - particularly by men who wanted to kiss them - that she had Liz Taylor's lips. And I have the tip of her nose. Perhaps this is how we divide Liz up for ourselves, so that we all own a bit of her. </p> <p>A few months ago, I was sent a postcard by an acquaintance. It is split into two halves. On one side is Liz in the pink towelling turban, the one when she was 33. On the other is Liz in the same headgear, at 60. Her eyes look as though they have been widened; her lips seem to be puffed up by silicone. Her oval face has lost its definition. I'm not sure whether any message was intended - but, anyway, she still looks wonderful to me. This won't, however, be going on any noticeboards. That moment has passed </p> <p>\u00a9 Ginny Dougary.

I can't summon the names of any of the other hotels we stayed in when I was young and my parents used to travel in style. Villa de la Robia was different. There was a garden with lots of tangled undergrowth and chipped, mossy statues lurking in the gloom. I had a room to myself, which you reached from some crumbling steps that led up from the shadows of the garden. I used to lie in my bed with its odd, sausage-shaped pillow, the shutters closed, and imagine what it would be like to kiss my favourite handsome waiter. One lunchtime, the usual placid hush in the restaurant was disturbed by the arrival of a family. Heads studiously did not swivel, but there was a sudden brightness, a subtle animated charge in the muted chatter. I can still see Liz clearly. She was wearing Capri pants and a dark headscarf. There were two teenagers with her - a boy and a girl, who were strikingly good-looking with their black hair and violet-blue eyes framed by thick eyebrows - and a rather grey, craggy man who must have been Richard Burton. They were sitting at the next table, and my mother - who had her own movie-star glamour - was determinedly unimpressed. After lunch, over coffee on the veranda, she turned to my father and said, \"Rather a dumpy little thing, didn't you think?\" \"My God, darling,\" he replied, \"she's not a patch on you.\" Liz hasn't had a major role in a film for years. Unlike Katharine Hepburn or Lauren Bacall, age has withered her acting career. There have been no grand matriarch roles or twilight-year romances. No Golden Ponds. And because we have not grown accustomed to seeing her grow old in Technicolor celluloid, we still think of her as a screen goddess, frozen in the past. We are constantly reminded that she is alive - if only because of her frequent brushes with death: the brain tumour three years ago, the fall the following year - but the Liz who has worked so hard at raising funds for and the profile of Aids charities, who once said that Michael Jackson was the least weird man she knew, is someone quite separate from her youthful screen persona. In that sense, she occupies a unique space: one in which she is both alive and dead. There are not many actors, of either sex, who have become so iconic in their lifetime. Warhol favoured the dead over the living in his prints - JFK, Mao, Marilyn, Elvis. But he also placed Liz in this pantheon, as if acknowledging her not-of-this-world lustre, and fixed on her image, circa 1960, with the tousled hooker's hairdo she wore in Butterfield 8. She was always a star rather than an actress. A lot of her films were B-movies, which were somehow redeemed by her luminous sheen. It feels like I've always loved her, even though there's something unconcrete and dreamlike about the way I conjure her in my imagination. She is not like other actors I admire, in that I cannot point to this or that role to illustrate precisely what it is about her that I find so appealing. She doesn't have a set of mannerisms that help you to place her. There is no equivalent to the Clint glint or the Marilyn wiggle. But for me, it was enough that when she was in a film she had some quality that made it impossible for me to take my eyes off her. She seemed to fill the screen, eclipsing everyone around her. I always saw her films retrospectively, and this may partly explain why I view her through a special lens. She seems always to have been there in my childhood and adolescence, although I never actively sought her out. I saw her by chance: a Sunday movie on a rainy afternoon, or late at night when I was a student, or as part of some film festival of 50s kitsch. Like most people, I have absorbed the soap opera of her life - the multiple marriages, the accidents, the illnesses, the addictions, the sojourns in the Betty Ford clinic - but, in my case, as an unwilling participant. I'd rather not know about these details, since they detract from the image of her in my mind's eye. I haven't retained much of an impression of her in National Velvet, although if I blink I can see her in jodhpurs, her hair tied up with a bow, the beauty spot on her cheek - already too sophisticated to look like a real little girl who loved horses. I can visualise her more clearly in Jane Eyre, although she had a tiny part. She played Helen, the angelic child who befriends Jane in the orphanage and dies beautifully. I remember her dark eyes gazing out of an unearthly white face. She was, of course, too good to be true - and probably would have been better cast as one of Jane's nasty, spoiled relatives. But I loved her satiny voice and believed in her sweetness. The films that stand out for me are the ones in which she was a poor little rich girl. Or, sometimes, the beautiful rich bitch. They were all made between the early 50s and the mid-60s, when she was at her swooning loveliest. Watching her was like basking in the reflected glory of her shimmering youthfulness. When I look back at those films now, as a body of work, I am struck by how dark they were. There was often the suggestion of something corrupt about her beauty, that it was both damaged and damaging; a hint of moral decay behind the succulent peachiness. She is a siren of doom, driving the men around her to murder or self-destruction. I rather think it was this sickness behind the bloom that I liked. There was also a frisson - a sort of fag-haggy appeal - in acknowledging the relationship between her status as a gay icon and her friendships with her leading men, who tended to be homosexual: Montgomery Clift in A Place In The Sun and Suddenly Last Summer; Rock Hudson and James Dean in Giant. But I don't think I would have responded to Liz so viscerally if she had been merely camp. There is a dangerous undertow to these films; a sense in which some sort of malign energy, which both emanates from her and is beyond her control, is propelling the protagonists to their downfall. Her kind of brittle shallowness can kill. The film that sums up this quality for me is, oddly, not A Place In The Sun - in which the rich girl's new boyfriend drowns his discarded pregnant girlfriend, which might seem to fit the bill more neatly - but Suddenly Last Summer. It still strikes me as astonishing that such an overtly homosexual theme could have been tackled on the screen as early as 1959. Here, the sickness is almost tangible. Young Liz in her white bathing suit - the fleshy bait to lure penniless young beach boys into the arms of her homosexual cousin; his harridan mother (Katharine Hepburn) in her throne-like chair on the veranda ordering a lobotomy for her hysterical niece in order to obliterate the memory of what happened on the day her son died; the ending - even now it makes me shiver to recall it: the boys who had been preyed upon by the cousin chasing him up the hill, joined by other children on the way to the top, tearing his immaculate white suit to shreds, and then his flesh. There was a time, at the height of her stardom, when Liz's fans - in their eagerness to steal a part of her lustre for themselves - were in danger of ripping her apart. They would grab at her hair, her mink coats, her fabulous jewels. There was something about her appeal that was as universal as the strange kinship the public felt for Princess Diana. When Liz was taken to hospital with pneumonia in 1961 and was reported as being close to death, fans pulled their cars to the side of the road and prayed for her recovery. If Liz had died then, she would have become a Marilyn or a Princess Di. Like them, she was a goddess who could pull us into her orbit. Her battle with weight, her weaknesses for a bad man and a good frock, were our own little lives writ large. You could even forgive her ostentatious displays of wealth and her excessive habits, since they so evidently did not bring her happiness. It is a peculiar quirk of fame that such an untypical woman can also, at some level, be an Everywoman. When I started to write this piece, I was concerned that it might sound deranged to be exploring the idea that I felt a personal connection with Liz because someone once said that I bore a passing resemblance to her. I reminded myself of the old bag in a film I once saw, who thrust a photograph of Princess Diana in front of her hairdresser and announced, \"I want to look like that.\" But I have come across other women who also have been told that they look like Liz - and none of them looks like me. My children's middle-aged nanny - one of the old guard in a tweed skirt and sensible shoes - used to tell me that people said she had Liz Taylor's eyes. A former colleague, an alluring scruff with unkempt hair, was often persuaded - particularly by men who wanted to kiss them - that she had Liz Taylor's lips. And I have the tip of her nose. Perhaps this is how we divide Liz up for ourselves, so that we all own a bit of her. A few months ago, I was sent a postcard by an acquaintance. It is split into two halves. On one side is Liz in the pink towelling turban, the one when she was 33. On the other is Liz in the same headgear, at 60. Her eyes look as though they have been widened; her lips seem to be puffed up by silicone. Her oval face has lost its definition. I'm not sure whether any message was intended - but, anyway, she still looks wonderful to me. This won't, however, be going on any noticeboards. That moment has passed \u00a9 Ginny Dougary.

      "body": "<p><strong> Mint tea sorbet with chocolate mint leaves</strong></p> <p> A refreshing sorbet, finished with mint leaves brushed with dark chocolate - peppermint crisps are the easy way out. Serves four.</p> <p><strong> 1 large handful fresh mint </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tbsp green tea </strong></p> <p><strong>100g white sugar lumps </strong></p> <p><strong>Juice of 2 lemons </strong></p> <p><strong>1 egg white</strong> </p> <p>To finish </p> <p><strong> 8 large, perfect mint leaves </strong></p> <p><strong>3-4 squares bitter chocolate</strong> </p> <p>Rinse the mint and cram it into a jug with the tea. Pour in 300ml boiling water and leave to infuse for five minutes. Add the sugar, stir thoroughly and leave to cool. Strain and add the lemon juice. Freeze for an hour or so, until ice crystals have formed but the mixture is not yet hard. Scoop into the liquidiser, add the egg white and process until pale and frothy. Freeze again until solid. It'll be ready in three to four hours, but can be left for longer, if required. </p> <p>To finish, melt the chocolate gently in a small bowl over boiling water. Brush the undersides of the mint leaves with the melted chocolate, transfer to a plate lined with cling- film and set briefly in the freezer to firm. Scoop the sorbet into well-chilled glasses, and tuck in a pair of mint leaves per serving. A trickle of cr\u00e8me de menthe would serve to gild the lily. </p> <p><strong> Rosemary, vodka and orange jellies</strong></p> <p> A grown-up dessert - put childish things behind you, but don't lose the plot. Serve with a crisp little biscuit - something sophisticated, such as an almond tuile. Serves six. </p> <p><strong> 2-3 small sprigs fresh rosemary </strong></p> <p><strong>25g gelatine (leaf or powder) </strong></p> <p><strong>100g caster sugar </strong></p> <p><strong>600ml fresh orange juice </strong></p> <p><strong>Zest of 1 orange, cut into fine strips </strong></p> <p><strong>150ml vodka</strong> </p> <p>In a small pan, bring 150ml water and the rosemary sprigs (save any flowers or tips of sprigs for decoration) up to the boil, switch off the heat and leave to cool and infuse. Remove the rosemary, sprinkle in the gelatine (if using leaf-gelatine, soften first in cold water and tear into small pieces), leave for about 10 minutes to swell, then stir over a gentle heat until the gelatine dissolves completely. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in another pan, heat the orange juice and vodka with the zest and sugar, stirring till the crystals dissolve. Remove the zest with a draining spoon and reserve. Off the heat, combine the two liquids, whisking to blend thoroughly. Allow to cool a little before dividing between six stemmed glasses - cocktail glasses for retro-chic. Finish with the reserved orange-zest and rosemary. </p> <p><strong> Lavender syllabub with lavender caramel</strong></p> <p> Very Barbara Cartland, this. If fresh lavender eludes you, use flowering thyme instead. Serves four to six.</p> <p>For the syllabub </p> <p><strong> 2-3 fresh lavender spikes </strong></p> <p><strong>150ml white wine </strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp caster sugar </strong></p> <p><strong>Juice of 1 lemon </strong></p> <p><strong>300ml chilled double cream </strong> * </p> <p> <strong> 1 tbsp eau-de-vie or brandy</strong> </p> <p>For the caramel </p> <p><strong> 3 tbsp caster sugar </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp fresh lavender flowers</strong> </p> <p>Heat the wine in a small pan, removing it just before it comes to the boil, and add the lavender spikes. Leave to infuse for 10 minutes, strain, and stir in the sugar, lemon juice and eau-de-vie. Whisk the cream until it begins to hold its shape - don't overwhip, or it'll turn to butter. Whisk in the lavender-wine infusion, and refrigerate. </p> <p>Meanwhile, make the finishing caramel. Heat a heavy frying pan over a medium heat, and sprinkle in the sugar. Watch carefully as it melts and then caramelises - don't let it burn. As it cooks, shake the pan every now and then, to distribute the crystals evenly, but do not stir. As soon as the sugar melts to a warm brown, remove from the heat and stir in the lavender flowers. Pour on to a lightly oiled marble slab or plate, and leave to cool and set. Once hardened, place the caramel between two sheets of clingfilm, bash it with a rolling pin to break into small pieces. Fold these into the syllabub just before serving. </p> <p><strong> Bayleaf junket</strong></p> <p> Fresh bayleaf - peppery, spicy, an underlying sweetness - is the perfect perfume for a delicate junket, which is the soft curd that forms when rennet, a digestive enzyme present in the stomachs of all mammals including ourselves, is added to warm milk. A delicate emulsion that splits all too easily into curds-and-whey, junket is never likely to be found loitering among the mousses and low-fat fromage frais in the supermarket's chill cabinet - which is a recommendation in itself. Serves four. </p> <p><strong> 600ml full-cream milk </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp rennet (if you can't get it from the supermarket, try the local health-food store) </strong></p> <p><strong>2 fresh bayleaves, torn in half</strong> </p> <p>To serve </p> <p><strong> Single cream </strong></p> <p><strong>Demerara sugar</strong> </p> <p>Leave the bayleaves to infuse in the milk in a pan for an hour or two. Gently warm the milk to just below boiling point - test the heat with a clean finger. Remove the bayleaves and stir in the rennet. Pour immediately into four small earthenware pots or glass tumblers. Cover with a cloth, and leave to set in a cool place for a couple of hours, until the surface is firm to the touch. To serve, trickle with a thin layer of cream and a generous crust of crunchy sugar. Delicious with a ripe fig - a fruit to which bayleaf, with its faint flavour of liquorice, has a particular affinity. </p> <p><strong> Rose-geranium and almond torte with rosewater syrup</strong></p> <p> When bruised or crushed, rose- geranium leaves release an astonishingly powerful scent. Elusively exquisite in a fruit salad or, as here, used to perfume a simple sponge-cake - no flour, nothing fancy, just fragrant. You're not likely to find rose-geranium down at the local greengrocer's, so head for the garden centre and add a potful to your window-box. Lemon balm makes an equally fragrant substitute. Serves six to eight. </p> <p><strong> 3-4 rose-geranium leaves, rinsed and dried </strong></p> <p><strong>Butter for greasing </strong></p> <p><strong>4 medium eggs </strong></p> <p><strong>175g caster sugar </strong></p> <p><strong>250g ground almonds</strong> </p> <p>To finish </p> <p><strong> 2-3 rose-geranium leaves, shredded </strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp rose-water </strong></p> <p><strong>2 tbsp honey </strong></p> <p><strong>Juice of 1 lemon</strong> </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Butter an 18cm sponge-cake tin and arrange the rose-geranium leaves on the base. Whisk the eggs, whites and yolks together, until frothy. Still whisking, sprinkle in the sugar, and whisk until the mixture is white, stiff and holds its shape in soft peaks - this will take twice as long as you expect. With a metal spoon, lightly fold in the ground almonds. Spoon over the leaves in the tin, and bake for 45-50 minutes, until well-risen and firm to the finger. Wait for 10 minutes before turning out on to a plate - lacking flour, it shrinks alarmingly. No matter, since it tastes delicious. </p> <p>Meanwhile, put all the finishing ingredients in a small pan, along with six tablespoons of water, bring to the boil, then simmer until reduced to half volume. Pour the hot syrup over the warm cake - it'll absorb it like a sponge. Exquisite with summer berries and cr\u00e8me fraiche</p>",

Watch carefully as it melts and then caramelises - don't let it burn. As it cooks, shake the pan every now and then, to distribute the crystals evenly, but do not stir. As soon as the sugar melts to a warm brown, remove from the heat and stir in the lavender flowers. Pour on to a lightly oiled marble slab or plate, and leave to cool and set. Once hardened, place the caramel between two sheets of clingfilm, bash it with a rolling pin to break into small pieces. Fold these into the syllabub just before serving. Bayleaf junket Fresh bayleaf - peppery, spicy, an underlying sweetness - is the perfect perfume for a delicate junket, which is the soft curd that forms when rennet, a digestive enzyme present in the stomachs of all mammals including ourselves, is added to warm milk. A delicate emulsion that splits all too easily into curds-and-whey, junket is never likely to be found loitering among the mousses and low-fat fromage frais in the supermarket's chill cabinet - which is a recommendation in itself. Serves four. 600ml full-cream milk 1 tsp rennet (if you can't get it from the supermarket, try the local health-food store) 2 fresh bayleaves, torn in half To serve Single cream Demerara sugar Leave the bayleaves to infuse in the milk in a pan for an hour or two. Gently warm the milk to just below boiling point - test the heat with a clean finger. Remove the bayleaves and stir in the rennet. Pour immediately into four small earthenware pots or glass tumblers. Cover with a cloth, and leave to set in a cool place for a couple of hours, until the surface is firm to the touch. To serve, trickle with a thin layer of cream and a generous crust of crunchy sugar. Delicious with a ripe fig - a fruit to which bayleaf, with its faint flavour of liquorice, has a particular affinity. Rose-geranium and almond torte with rosewater syrup When bruised or crushed, rose- geranium leaves release an astonishingly powerful scent. Elusively exquisite in a fruit salad or, as here, used to perfume a simple sponge-cake - no flour, nothing fancy, just fragrant. You're not likely to find rose-geranium down at the local greengrocer's, so head for the garden centre and add a potful to your window-box. Lemon balm makes an equally fragrant substitute. Serves six to eight. 3-4 rose-geranium leaves, rinsed and dried Butter for greasing 4 medium eggs 175g caster sugar 250g ground almonds To finish 2-3 rose-geranium leaves, shredded 2 tbsp rose-water 2 tbsp honey Juice of 1 lemon Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Butter an 18cm sponge-cake tin and arrange the rose-geranium leaves on the base. Whisk the eggs, whites and yolks together, until frothy. Still whisking, sprinkle in the sugar, and whisk until the mixture is white, stiff and holds its shape in soft peaks - this will take twice as long as you expect. With a metal spoon, lightly fold in the ground almonds. Spoon over the leaves in the tin, and bake for 45-50 minutes, until well-risen and firm to the finger. Wait for 10 minutes before turning out on to a plate - lacking flour, it shrinks alarmingly. No matter, since it tastes delicious. Meanwhile, put all the finishing ingredients in a small pan, along with six tablespoons of water, bring to the boil, then simmer until reduced to half volume. Pour the hot syrup over the warm cake - it'll absorb it like a sponge. Exquisite with summer berries and cr\u00e8me fraiche",

      "body": "<p>'I'd know that voice anywhere,\" said the man standing behind Michael Berkeley in the queue at Cardiff station. Berkeley's is one of the few voices - deep, lilting, seductive - that could make asking for a ticket to Ludlow so striking. But would the man, who confessed to being an amateur singer, have known Berkeley's music? Probably not: it is the conundrum at the heart of Michael Berkeley's life. </p> <p>Berkeley is a composer of, for want of a better term, serious contemporary music. He has written more than 50 orchestral and chamber scores, and next Friday will unveil his second opera, Jane Eyre. His first, Baa Baa Black Sheep, was staged in 1993. His output is diverse; his reputation is growing; he considers himself a \"late developer\" and says the best is yet to come. Yet, despite his protestations, he is still better known as a broadcaster and administrator than as a composer; many of his works have not been recorded and too many of those that were put on disc have been deleted. </p> <p>His music, especially his vocal music, is very accessible; melodies come readily to him (sometimes too readily, he says) and lodge in the listener's head; yet he is lazily lumped together with avant-gardists and minimalists by audiences who write off new music in its entirety as unlistenable. Talking a couple of years ago about Private Passions, the Desert Island Discs-style programme he presents on Radio 3, he said: \"It has disconcerted me that we've still got such a long way to go with really intelligent people in terms of contemporary music.\" That gap, despite his efforts as composer and communicator, is still huge, the residual fear of the new and dissonant palpable. </p> <p>\"The problem with contemporary music - and its magic - is that it's as if it came from another planet,\" Berkeley once said. He went on to make a clever point about Bernard Herrmann's music in Hitchcock's Psycho: that in the concert hall, audiences would find it jarring and difficult, but because it comes clothed with images its demands are accepted. \"If only people could approach music with a completely open mind and allow it to build a landscape in the mind with dramatic and visual images, then it becomes a much more enriching experience.\" </p> <p>Berkeley is best known for presenting Private Passions and for having been thrust into the role of spokesman for the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, when it faced financial and administrative meltdown in 1998 (\"I joined the board expecting to go to eight or nine meetings a year and ended up in there every other day, trying to hold everything together,\" he recalls ruefully). Whenever a major job in the small, hothouse classical-music world comes up, Berkeley's name is put in the frame. He was tipped to take over from Nicholas Kenyon as controller of Radio 3 in 1998, and will no doubt be mooted as a possible successor to Michael Kaiser when he steps down next year as chief executive of the Opera House. There is just one problem: despite public perceptions, he doesn't want to be a bureaucrat. </p> <p>\"There's no way I would give up the daytime of my life to be an administrator,\" he says. \"It's ridiculous. It's like saying to David Hockney 'you should be running BBC2'. It's not compatible with being a creative artist. Composing occupies by far the largest part of my life and anything else I do has to fit around it.\" </p> <p>What if Covent Garden, which has managed to get through four chief executives in as many years, came calling? \"There are moments of temptation, but if you want to be a serious composer you have to eschew them. It's not just the money that is tempting; you could do a lot if you were head of Radio 3 or the Opera House, you could do a lot about the things that you believe in. But I want to be an artist rather than a mandarin. All my life I've fought to retain large pockets of time in which to compose. </p> <p>\"Michael Kaiser and I got on very well because he is utterly committed to both opera and ballet, and I'm sorry to see him go. He leaves the place in very good working order. We are financially more stable now than at any time since I joined the board in 1996, the rebuilding of the house has been completed and the artistic direction of both companies is very happily in place. There is an exciting job for a new chief executive, but that person won't be me. I am pleased to be able to help on the artistic side, but I am, and always will be, a composer.\" </p> <p>Composing is in the blood. He is the son of Sir Lennox Berkeley, a composer of great economy and elegance, whose music has fallen out of favour; he is also the godson of Benjamin Britten, one of the commanding figures of 20th- century British music. Berkeley junior knew from the age of six that he wanted to be a composer, and his determination has never wavered. He worked at London Weekend Television in the mid-70s and then joined the staff of Radio 3, but the media always played second fiddle to his artistic impulse. </p> <p>He has shown an admirable commitment to the muse, but some critics are less than convinced that the muse has kept her side of the bargain. \"Because of his father there was an expectation that he would be a creative person,\" says one. \"He is a brilliant communicator, broadcaster and festival organiser, but his music never really attains that level of excellence. It's an example of the Sullivan syndrome: just as Sir Arthur was dissatisfied with all the Gilbert and Sullivan stuff and wanted to write grand opera, so Michael is dissatisfied with being a great communicator and wants to be a great composer. \"His misfortune is to be one of a generation of prodigious talents - Oliver Knussen, Colin Matthews, George Benjamin. He just doesn't have the same individuality of voice as them.\" </p> <p>That verdict might have held true a decade ago, but is unfair now. In the 80s, Berkeley was striving to find a voice, and was locked into an English lyrical tradition that seemed pass\u00e9 and derivative. In the past 10 years, he has discovered a harder edge and a more personal style that combines rawness and dissonance with his natural lyricism. </p> <p>He is not fazed by criticism of his music, because he is his own severest critic. \"I'm a late developer like my father,\" he says. \"I've only written a handful of pieces that I really like. I think Baa Baa Black Sheep works, though I can write opera better now and Jane Eyre is a much more organic and taut piece. There was a time when I wanted to take quite a lot of stuff out of the catalogue, but my publisher dissuaded me. Some of the pieces, while technically weak, are quite touching in their naivety. In any case, it's hard to say what will survive: time will sort it all out.\" </p> <p>\"His early music was rather middle of the road and there was a sense of him following in his father's footsteps,\" says the composer Colin Matthews. But his music has become much tougher and tauter.\" Matthews suggests that the death of Berkeley's father in 1989 might have been a musical liberation: a chance to break out of the restrained, polished English style and embrace something rawer and more dangerous. </p> <p>Roger Wright, controller of Radio 3, says Berkeley is by no means the first composer to have taken some time to discover his true voice. \"Very few composers find their voice early and stick with it,\" says Wright. \"I suppose you might single out Walton and Messiaen as two who, when you hear their very early music, you think 'that's them' straight away. But there are hundreds of examples of composers who did it the other way around, and it must be even harder if you have a composer father.\" </p> <p>Berkeley, who was born in 1948, describes his childhood as \"charmed\", but hints that some of the darkness that now articulates itself in his music can be ascribed to his adolescence. His father had been gay in his early years and had lived with Britten. Sir Lennox married in his mid-40s - \"people were very surprised\", says Berkeley - and his wife, Elizabeth Bernstein, who was his secretary during the second world war, was 20 years his junior. Berkeley's mother is now 77 and lives close to him in London. He was the eldest of three brothers: all had a musical education but he is the only professional musician among them. One brother is a photographer, the other runs a burglar alarm business, and after a rough patch he is now on good terms with both. </p> <p>\"My father was quite introverted and locked into his own world,\" says Berkeley. \"He was a rather saintly character in some ways, very sweet and gentle on the whole. He was incapable of coming back from an opera or a concert without getting the score out and saying 'look, isn't this wonderful?'. We were surrounded by a lot of people who were gay [Auden, Poulenc and Britten were family friends] and there was surprise that my parents entrusted me to some people with rather dubious reputations. But it was a very emancipated upbringing, and meant that one was curious about contemporary art and literature as well as music.\" </p> <p>That was the upside. The downside was that, being brought up in such intellectual circles, he was never allowed to be a child. \"He once said that he never felt he could be a young person,\" says one close friend. While he admired his father, the relationship became a little distant, and it is tempting to read into his thoughts on the repressiveness of Sir Lennox's music a critique of his rarefied upbringing. \"I loved his music very much and I learned a lot from it, but I also got a little frustrated by it,\" says Berkeley. \"I was a more naturally extrovert character, and I longed for it sometimes to seize me and shake me.\" </p> <p>\"He had an interesting childhood,\" says another friend. \"He was in a privileged position but it was also a burden, and he understands the pain of getting through life. It is interesting that both his operas are about people wrenched from their environments and placed in threatening situations.\" </p> <p>Berkeley was educated at the Oratory School near Reading and at Westminster Cathedral Choir School, going on to study piano, composition and singing at the Royal Academy at the age of 17. Though he does not say so explicitly, he evidently feels that his years at the academy lacked focus. \"I went there too early,\" he says. \"I was quite lazy and needed someone to really push me. I learned quite a lot about opera but not much about composition.\" </p> <p>He did, though, play keyboard in a band, called Seeds of Discord, with a friend from school and two doctors from Bart's. Despite a certain King's Road cachet, they never quite made Top Of The Pops, but Berkeley says the experience stood him in good stead and he still proudly lists \"rock musician\" as an early accomplishment in Who's Who. He also had a druggy spell - all part of a rebellion against the constraints of that aesthetically charged childhood. </p> <p>He intended to become a singer to support his work as a composer, but that plan was scotched when he became seriously ill with renal tuberculosis at the age of 20. \"I'd been through a difficult relationship and my emotional state was rather jagged and vulnerable,\" he recalls. \"No one knew what it was for a while, and I got very thin and anaemic.\" </p> <p>The illness did, however, concentrate the mind. \"At that age you think you will live for ever, and it was salutary to realise that I couldn't make a living from singing any more and that if I wanted to write I'd better start.\" He went to study with the composer Richard Rodney Bennett, now best known for his film scores but at that point regarded as a rising avant-garde talent, who started to temper Berkeley's natural lyricism with greater rigour. </p> <p>\"He didn't want me to change my style. He didn't want me to change my language. He didn't want me to ape him or ape anyone else. He just saw that I had something to say, but I didn't have much idea about how to develop musical ideas. He made me study aspects of serialism, not to write atonal music but because it's a wonderful way of looking at a cell of notes, turning it upside down, running it backwards, using it so that all the harmony follows from it. You can then still write music which is patently melodic but which has an organic feel to it.\" </p> <p>In many ways 1979 proved the seminal year in Berkeley's life. As well as leaving Broadcasting House for the uncertain life of a freelance (he felt his music would never get a fair hearing on the station if he remained on the staff), he also got married - to Deborah Rogers, now one of the UK's leading literary agents - and bought (for \u00a35,000) a farmhouse in Powys, just a few miles across the border from Hereford but very isolated, tranquil and beautiful - a bolt-hole, a place to compose. Over the past 20 years, the house and grounds have grown along with Berkeley's career as a composer: as adjoining fields have come up for sale he has bought them. He met a local farm labourer, Steven Morgan, and they went into partnership, rearing cattle and sheep. Berkeley now owns 350 acres - modest in farming terms - on which Morgan tends 600 ewes and 60 cattle. The crisis in farming has made the past few years difficult, but their enthusiasm is undimmed. </p> <p>\"We'll never get rich by it, but it's a richness of another sort, an aesthetic richness,\" says Berkeley. \"I've loved learning about farming. It has given me an understanding of how the countryside works and a less romantic view of it. The arrangement was always that because this was my workplace, Steven would assume that I would do nothing, but in fact I loved coming and doing hay-making and lambing.\" </p> <p>Berkeley splits his time between the farm in Wales and his home in west London, where he lives with his wife and their 13-year-old daughter Jessica, whom the couple adopted from the US when she was just four days old. They pay family visits to the farm at weekends and in the holidays, and Jessica rides and plays with Morgan's three children. Berkeley says the farm, where he loves to work and walk, is his \"spiritual home\"; London is the base for that more public part of his life (his house there has a studio where Private Passions is recorded, always in the evening to leave the mornings free for composition). \"I have a slightly schizophrenic personality and I thrive on having this duality in my life,\" he says. \"I realised that to make my composing work I had to have somewhere where, once I was there, it was pretty difficult to get me out.\" </p> <p>There are very few CDs in the farmhouse, and he apologises for his non-state-of-the-art CD system. \"I don't want to listen to very much music when I'm composing,\" he says. \"You need to enter your own world. I find this with every composer. Michael Tippett used to watch soap operas. He just wanted to shut off completely.\" </p> <p>Jane Eyre, which has its premiere on Friday at the Cheltenham International Festival of Music, has had a dramatic and protracted birth. In May last year the original - and only - copy of the score was stolen from Berkeley's doorstep as he was unloading his car outside his London home. The event hit the headlines; he was interviewed on the Today programme; appeals were made; rewards offered; but the briefcase containing the manuscript was never found. (It is ironic that an artist's work should only be of widespread press and public interest when it disappears.) </p> <p>Berkeley was devastated. \"He went through torment. He was in despair,\" says his friend, the critic and broadcaster Robert Sandall. \"He had struggled to get it going and then he lost it. He suffered a terrific crisis of confidence.\" </p> <p>\"I was completely shell-shocked at first,\" recalls Berkeley. \"There were 60 pages of full score, plus sketches and the piano reduction - the template of the whole opera. It was hopeless trying to reconstruct it; it had to be redone altogether. I was so sickened by it that I didn't feel I could go back to the beginning immediately. What I felt I could do was pick it up from the point I had got to dramatically. I did eventually go back to the beginning, and I thought in the end it was tighter and stronger as a result.\" </p> <p>Berkeley had a year in which to re-compose the work, and finally finished it three weeks ago. He has spent the past fortnight attending rehearsals in Cardiff, pacing around the hall like an expectant father and making the occasional suggestion, but being careful not to issue orders. This is artistic collaboration, not a stage for a composer's self-esteem. </p> <p>The fact that Berkeley the composer of Jane Eyre is also the artistic director of the Cheltenham festival has led to accusations of self-promotion. \"I have heard a lot of muttering about the fact that a festival director should spend so much money on his own opera,\" says one music critic. Colin Matthews says that it is by no means unprecedented and cites the example of Britten at Aldeburgh, but doubts whether he would do it himself. </p> <p>Berkeley, who has been generous in encouraging and commissioning other composers in his five years in charge of Cheltenham, is unrepentant. \"It's the only piece that has been commissioned from me while I've been there. We sorted this out very early on: I was going as a composer and I think it's a strength to have a practising composer running a festival and contributing pieces every now and again, just as Michael Tippett did at Bath. I didn't go there as an administrator; I went as a composer. You have to be careful not to abuse it, but I've put on 25 or so new pieces every year and I don't feel I've shortchanged anybody.\" </p> <p>It is to be hoped that the controversy does not overshadow the reception of Jane Eyre, because the opera promises much. As with Baa Baa Black Sheep, his Kipling-based opera which won considerable acclaim when it was produced in 1993, the libretto has been written by the Australian author David Malouf, whose restraint complements Berkeley's more gothic imagination. The production will be staged by Music Theatre Wales, which specialises in contemporary opera, and after Cheltenham it will go on tour, reaching Covent Garden's Linbury Studio in early November. It is a chamber piece for five voices and small orchestra, similar in mood to Britten's Turn Of The Screw and combining lyrical expressiveness with brooding menace. </p> <p>Berkeley and Malouf have stripped the book down to its essentials. \"What I like about Jane Eyre is the Bluebeardian aspect,\" says Berkeley. \"You have to get rid of everything that is superfluous - the childhood, St John Rivers, even Grace Poole. You have to do that in opera: you cut it down to what you really need, and end up with something which is quite lean. Ultimately a libretto has to be something that needs music to breathe; if it's all there in the libretto as a satisfactory literary experience, then why bother to put music to it? The libretto that David produced clearly does need music; he once said that a libretto in itself is a poor thing. The libretto must take second place to the music.\" </p> <p>He is intrigued by the different displays of female sexuality in the novel: \"the frightening sexuality of Mrs Rochester, the flirtatious Jane, the homely Mrs Fairfax, and the young but knowing Adele, all with Rochester in the middle. The whole concept of a madwoman upstairs ululating is very operatic. Also the concept of a story which is predicated on telepathic voices - that's music, that's the thing that music can do which nothing else can do. Literature can tell you about the idea of hearing voices, but in music you can do it.\" </p> <p>Berkeley, a romantic writing in an unromantic age, hopes that Jane Eyre will be a happy marriage of lyricism and emotional intensity. \"There is a romantic side and a melodic element to the opera, but there is always something turbulent underneath. You can't do an opera about Jane Eyre and deny the romantic side of it, but there is also a dark side, and I like the friction between the two. </p> <p>\"I like the idea of something in which you can allow yourself to be melodically expressive, and yet there is a friction, so the audience is on the one hand seduced by the romantic-ness but on the other hand is disturbed by those things which are probably in all of us but which we don't entirely understand - to what extent is Jane being manipulative, to what extent is Rochester being truthful? I remember one or two people I trust saying to me, your language is developing but don't forsake the natural lyricism. I find lyricism in a lot of quite complex music.\" </p> <p>Michael McCarthy, director of Jane Eyre, says he is a welcome presence in rehearsals. \"His ego has never got in the way, and he lets us question the work and ask how and why. He knows what he is doing and where he is going, what depths he is plumbing emotionally. His music can take him into darker places than you might imagine or that he could ever describe in words. In Baa Baa Black Sheep, for example, there are powerful undercurrents about the way in which children are treated. He is a vulnerable, sensitive soul, and that's all there in his work, especially in his operas where emotions are undisguised.\" </p> <p>Berkeley is aware of the disparity between his smooth public persona and his darker musical personality, but is unable or unwilling to account for it. \"We all have a dark side,\" he says. \"Just as people assume that because you broadcast you must be socially incredibly at ease, so they assume that because you sound comfortable interviewing people that everything is at a certain level, but there are different layers. For many years I felt rather socially inept, and some of the frustrations that I felt in my relationships with people led to violent outbursts in the music as a form of release. Music gives me an outlet for things I find it difficult to articulate verbally, socially or perhaps even emotionally.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance: Michael Fitzhardinge Berkeley </strong></p> <p><strong>Born:</strong> May 29 1948, son of Sir Lennox and Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Bernstein) Berkeley. </p> <p><strong> Educated: </strong> The Oratory School, Reading; Westminster Cathedral Choir School; Royal Academy of Music; studied privately with Richard Rodney Bennett. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> 1979 Deborah Rogers (one daughter, Jessica). </p> <p><strong> Career: </strong> LWT; Radio 3 announcer 1974-79; composer and freelance radio and TV presenter since 1979. </p> <p><strong> Some compositions: </strong> Or Shall We Die?

He is the son of Sir Lennox Berkeley, a composer of great economy and elegance, whose music has fallen out of favour; he is also the godson of Benjamin Britten, one of the commanding figures of 20th- century British music. Berkeley junior knew from the age of six that he wanted to be a composer, and his determination has never wavered. He worked at London Weekend Television in the mid-70s and then joined the staff of Radio 3, but the media always played second fiddle to his artistic impulse. He has shown an admirable commitment to the muse, but some critics are less than convinced that the muse has kept her side of the bargain. \"Because of his father there was an expectation that he would be a creative person,\" says one. \"He is a brilliant communicator, broadcaster and festival organiser, but his music never really attains that level of excellence. It's an example of the Sullivan syndrome: just as Sir Arthur was dissatisfied with all the Gilbert and Sullivan stuff and wanted to write grand opera, so Michael is dissatisfied with being a great communicator and wants to be a great composer. \"His misfortune is to be one of a generation of prodigious talents - Oliver Knussen, Colin Matthews, George Benjamin. He just doesn't have the same individuality of voice as them.\" That verdict might have held true a decade ago, but is unfair now. In the 80s, Berkeley was striving to find a voice, and was locked into an English lyrical tradition that seemed pass\u00e9 and derivative. In the past 10 years, he has discovered a harder edge and a more personal style that combines rawness and dissonance with his natural lyricism. He is not fazed by criticism of his music, because he is his own severest critic. \"I'm a late developer like my father,\" he says. \"I've only written a handful of pieces that I really like. I think Baa Baa Black Sheep works, though I can write opera better now and Jane Eyre is a much more organic and taut piece. There was a time when I wanted to take quite a lot of stuff out of the catalogue, but my publisher dissuaded me. Some of the pieces, while technically weak, are quite touching in their naivety. In any case, it's hard to say what will survive: time will sort it all out.\" \"His early music was rather middle of the road and there was a sense of him following in his father's footsteps,\" says the composer Colin Matthews. But his music has become much tougher and tauter.\" Matthews suggests that the death of Berkeley's father in 1989 might have been a musical liberation: a chance to break out of the restrained, polished English style and embrace something rawer and more dangerous. Roger Wright, controller of Radio 3, says Berkeley is by no means the first composer to have taken some time to discover his true voice. \"Very few composers find their voice early and stick with it,\" says Wright. \"I suppose you might single out Walton and Messiaen as two who, when you hear their very early music, you think 'that's them' straight away. But there are hundreds of examples of composers who did it the other way around, and it must be even harder if you have a composer father.\" Berkeley, who was born in 1948, describes his childhood as \"charmed\", but hints that some of the darkness that now articulates itself in his music can be ascribed to his adolescence. His father had been gay in his early years and had lived with Britten. Sir Lennox married in his mid-40s - \"people were very surprised\", says Berkeley - and his wife, Elizabeth Bernstein, who was his secretary during the second world war, was 20 years his junior. Berkeley's mother is now 77 and lives close to him in London. He was the eldest of three brothers: all had a musical education but he is the only professional musician among them. One brother is a photographer, the other runs a burglar alarm business, and after a rough patch he is now on good terms with both. \"My father was quite introverted and locked into his own world,\" says Berkeley. \"He was a rather saintly character in some ways, very sweet and gentle on the whole. He was incapable of coming back from an opera or a concert without getting the score out and saying 'look, isn't this wonderful?'. We were surrounded by a lot of people who were gay [Auden, Poulenc and Britten were family friends] and there was surprise that my parents entrusted me to some people with rather dubious reputations. But it was a very emancipated upbringing, and meant that one was curious about contemporary art and literature as well as music.\" That was the upside. The downside was that, being brought up in such intellectual circles, he was never allowed to be a child. \"He once said that he never felt he could be a young person,\" says one close friend. While he admired his father, the relationship became a little distant, and it is tempting to read into his thoughts on the repressiveness of Sir Lennox's music a critique of his rarefied upbringing. \"I loved his music very much and I learned a lot from it, but I also got a little frustrated by it,\" says Berkeley. \"I was a more naturally extrovert character, and I longed for it sometimes to seize me and shake me.\" \"He had an interesting childhood,\" says another friend. \"He was in a privileged position but it was also a burden, and he understands the pain of getting through life. It is interesting that both his operas are about people wrenched from their environments and placed in threatening situations.\" Berkeley was educated at the Oratory School near Reading and at Westminster Cathedral Choir School, going on to study piano, composition and singing at the Royal Academy at the age of 17. Though he does not say so explicitly, he evidently feels that his years at the academy lacked focus. \"I went there too early,\" he says. \"I was quite lazy and needed someone to really push me. I learned quite a lot about opera but not much about composition.\" He did, though, play keyboard in a band, called Seeds of Discord, with a friend from school and two doctors from Bart's. Despite a certain King's Road cachet, they never quite made Top Of The Pops, but Berkeley says the experience stood him in good stead and he still proudly lists \"rock musician\" as an early accomplishment in Who's Who. He also had a druggy spell - all part of a rebellion against the constraints of that aesthetically charged childhood. He intended to become a singer to support his work as a composer, but that plan was scotched when he became seriously ill with renal tuberculosis at the age of 20. \"I'd been through a difficult relationship and my emotional state was rather jagged and vulnerable,\" he recalls. \"No one knew what it was for a while, and I got very thin and anaemic.\" The illness did, however, concentrate the mind. \"At that age you think you will live for ever, and it was salutary to realise that I couldn't make a living from singing any more and that if I wanted to write I'd better start.\" He went to study with the composer Richard Rodney Bennett, now best known for his film scores but at that point regarded as a rising avant-garde talent, who started to temper Berkeley's natural lyricism with greater rigour. \"He didn't want me to change my style. He didn't want me to change my language. He didn't want me to ape him or ape anyone else. He just saw that I had something to say, but I didn't have much idea about how to develop musical ideas. He made me study aspects of serialism, not to write atonal music but because it's a wonderful way of looking at a cell of notes, turning it upside down, running it backwards, using it so that all the harmony follows from it. You can then still write music which is patently melodic but which has an organic feel to it.\" In many ways 1979 proved the seminal year in Berkeley's life. As well as leaving Broadcasting House for the uncertain life of a freelance (he felt his music would never get a fair hearing on the station if he remained on the staff), he also got married - to Deborah Rogers, now one of the UK's leading literary agents - and bought (for \u00a35,000) a farmhouse in Powys, just a few miles across the border from Hereford but very isolated, tranquil and beautiful - a bolt-hole, a place to compose. Over the past 20 years, the house and grounds have grown along with Berkeley's career as a composer: as adjoining fields have come up for sale he has bought them. He met a local farm labourer, Steven Morgan, and they went into partnership, rearing cattle and sheep. Berkeley now owns 350 acres - modest in farming terms - on which Morgan tends 600 ewes and 60 cattle. The crisis in farming has made the past few years difficult, but their enthusiasm is undimmed. \"We'll never get rich by it, but it's a richness of another sort, an aesthetic richness,\" says Berkeley. \"I've loved learning about farming. It has given me an understanding of how the countryside works and a less romantic view of it. The arrangement was always that because this was my workplace, Steven would assume that I would do nothing, but in fact I loved coming and doing hay-making and lambing.\" Berkeley splits his time between the farm in Wales and his home in west London, where he lives with his wife and their 13-year-old daughter Jessica, whom the couple adopted from the US when she was just four days old. They pay family visits to the farm at weekends and in the holidays, and Jessica rides and plays with Morgan's three children. Berkeley says the farm, where he loves to work and walk, is his \"spiritual home\"; London is the base for that more public part of his life (his house there has a studio where Private Passions is recorded, always in the evening to leave the mornings free for composition). \"I have a slightly schizophrenic personality and I thrive on having this duality in my life,\" he says. \"I realised that to make my composing work I had to have somewhere where, once I was there, it was pretty difficult to get me out.\" There are very few CDs in the farmhouse, and he apologises for his non-state-of-the-art CD system. \"I don't want to listen to very much music when I'm composing,\" he says. \"You need to enter your own world. I find this with every composer. Michael Tippett used to watch soap operas. He just wanted to shut off completely.\" Jane Eyre, which has its premiere on Friday at the Cheltenham International Festival of Music, has had a dramatic and protracted birth. In May last year the original - and only - copy of the score was stolen from Berkeley's doorstep as he was unloading his car outside his London home. The event hit the headlines; he was interviewed on the Today programme; appeals were made; rewards offered; but the briefcase containing the manuscript was never found. (It is ironic that an artist's work should only be of widespread press and public interest when it disappears.) Berkeley was devastated. \"He went through torment. He was in despair,\" says his friend, the critic and broadcaster Robert Sandall. \"He had struggled to get it going and then he lost it. He suffered a terrific crisis of confidence.\" \"I was completely shell-shocked at first,\" recalls Berkeley. \"There were 60 pages of full score, plus sketches and the piano reduction - the template of the whole opera. It was hopeless trying to reconstruct it; it had to be redone altogether. I was so sickened by it that I didn't feel I could go back to the beginning immediately. What I felt I could do was pick it up from the point I had got to dramatically. I did eventually go back to the beginning, and I thought in the end it was tighter and stronger as a result.\" Berkeley had a year in which to re-compose the work, and finally finished it three weeks ago. He has spent the past fortnight attending rehearsals in Cardiff, pacing around the hall like an expectant father and making the occasional suggestion, but being careful not to issue orders. This is artistic collaboration, not a stage for a composer's self-esteem. The fact that Berkeley the composer of Jane Eyre is also the artistic director of the Cheltenham festival has led to accusations of self-promotion. \"I have heard a lot of muttering about the fact that a festival director should spend so much money on his own opera,\" says one music critic. Colin Matthews says that it is by no means unprecedented and cites the example of Britten at Aldeburgh, but doubts whether he would do it himself. Berkeley, who has been generous in encouraging and commissioning other composers in his five years in charge of Cheltenham, is unrepentant. \"It's the only piece that has been commissioned from me while I've been there. We sorted this out very early on: I was going as a composer and I think it's a strength to have a practising composer running a festival and contributing pieces every now and again, just as Michael Tippett did at Bath. I didn't go there as an administrator; I went as a composer. You have to be careful not to abuse it, but I've put on 25 or so new pieces every year and I don't feel I've shortchanged anybody.\" It is to be hoped that the controversy does not overshadow the reception of Jane Eyre, because the opera promises much. As with Baa Baa Black Sheep, his Kipling-based opera which won considerable acclaim when it was produced in 1993, the libretto has been written by the Australian author David Malouf, whose restraint complements Berkeley's more gothic imagination. The production will be staged by Music Theatre Wales, which specialises in contemporary opera, and after Cheltenham it will go on tour, reaching Covent Garden's Linbury Studio in early November. It is a chamber piece for five voices and small orchestra, similar in mood to Britten's Turn Of The Screw and combining lyrical expressiveness with brooding menace. Berkeley and Malouf have stripped the book down to its essentials. \"What I like about Jane Eyre is the Bluebeardian aspect,\" says Berkeley. \"You have to get rid of everything that is superfluous - the childhood, St John Rivers, even Grace Poole. You have to do that in opera: you cut it down to what you really need, and end up with something which is quite lean. Ultimately a libretto has to be something that needs music to breathe; if it's all there in the libretto as a satisfactory literary experience, then why bother to put music to it? The libretto that David produced clearly does need music; he once said that a libretto in itself is a poor thing. The libretto must take second place to the music.\" He is intrigued by the different displays of female sexuality in the novel: \"the frightening sexuality of Mrs Rochester, the flirtatious Jane, the homely Mrs Fairfax, and the young but knowing Adele, all with Rochester in the middle. The whole concept of a madwoman upstairs ululating is very operatic. Also the concept of a story which is predicated on telepathic voices - that's music, that's the thing that music can do which nothing else can do. Literature can tell you about the idea of hearing voices, but in music you can do it.\" Berkeley, a romantic writing in an unromantic age, hopes that Jane Eyre will be a happy marriage of lyricism and emotional intensity. \"There is a romantic side and a melodic element to the opera, but there is always something turbulent underneath. You can't do an opera about Jane Eyre and deny the romantic side of it, but there is also a dark side, and I like the friction between the two. \"I like the idea of something in which you can allow yourself to be melodically expressive, and yet there is a friction, so the audience is on the one hand seduced by the romantic-ness but on the other hand is disturbed by those things which are probably in all of us but which we don't entirely understand - to what extent is Jane being manipulative, to what extent is Rochester being truthful? I remember one or two people I trust saying to me, your language is developing but don't forsake the natural lyricism. I find lyricism in a lot of quite complex music.\" Michael McCarthy, director of Jane Eyre, says he is a welcome presence in rehearsals. \"His ego has never got in the way, and he lets us question the work and ask how and why. He knows what he is doing and where he is going, what depths he is plumbing emotionally. His music can take him into darker places than you might imagine or that he could ever describe in words. In Baa Baa Black Sheep, for example, there are powerful undercurrents about the way in which children are treated. He is a vulnerable, sensitive soul, and that's all there in his work, especially in his operas where emotions are undisguised.\" Berkeley is aware of the disparity between his smooth public persona and his darker musical personality, but is unable or unwilling to account for it. \"We all have a dark side,\" he says. \"Just as people assume that because you broadcast you must be socially incredibly at ease, so they assume that because you sound comfortable interviewing people that everything is at a certain level, but there are different layers. For many years I felt rather socially inept, and some of the frustrations that I felt in my relationships with people led to violent outbursts in the music as a form of release. Music gives me an outlet for things I find it difficult to articulate verbally, socially or perhaps even emotionally.\" Life at a glance: Michael Fitzhardinge Berkeley Born: May 29 1948, son of Sir Lennox and Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Bernstein) Berkeley.

      "body": "<p>Afew sprigs or a small handful of chopped herbs is the amount you'd normally expect to use in a recipe. But buy your herbs from a shop or supermarket, and such quantities will make only the merest dent in what is more often than not a large and expensive bunch or plastic packet. At 60p-\u00a31 per herb, that can end up costing as much, if not more, than the other main ingredients in a meal for which four or five herbs are required. </p> <p>Leftover herbs face one of two fates: either a heap of once-aromatic leaves will spend a limp week in the fridge before going in the bin; or the remains of the bunch will sit in a glass of water by the sink until the water becomes a gluey, green soup of stringy, rancid stems. </p> <p>But it needn't be that way. Herbs are very easy to grow at home, be that on just a window-sill or in a larger outdoor space. That's because most herbs are highly independent plants that require none of the cosseting of more rarefied species. Herbs rely for their flavour and aroma on a high distillation of essential oils, which is best achieved by growing them in full sun. However, you can still get worthwhile results in partial shade. </p> <p>In the wild, herbs are toughened by harsh conditions, so over-tending them in the domestic environment will only create weak plants with diminished culinary potential. You don't even need to be picky about soil types. But the one thing all herbs need is good drainage (although a few, such as mint and parsley, will tolerate moisture-retentive soil). To assess your soil's drainage capacity, pour water on to the surface until it forms a puddle - it should then disappear fairly quickly. If it does not, then improve the drainage by digging in pea shingle to break up the topsoil and speed the flow of water from the surface to the subsoil, where it will not waterlog roots. </p> <p>If your soil is highly acidic or an impenetrable clay pancake - common in cities, where spoil from house building constitutes the base of many a garden - or if you have no soil at all, a herb garden will do just as well in pots or raised beds. Wooden boxes, window-boxes and terracotta pots are ideal. (If you are a minimalist/modernist who insists on galvanised or stainless steel, line the container first with polystyrene sheeting to insulate the roots from extreme heat.) Put a good 6-10cm layer of drainage material (broken crock, pebbles or broken polystyrene) in the base of your chosen container, then add a mixture of 60% soil-based compost with 40% multi-purpose (also add drainage material - pea-shingle or perlite - at a rate of one good handful per spadeful of compost, to prevent the fine composts from suffocating roots.) Give your new plants space to grow, and water them well as they establish. And that's all there is to it. Honest. </p> <p>When planting herbs in a bed, put tall herbs such as fennel, lovage and rosemary at the back, so that they do not overshadow low-growing species such as thyme, parsley and marjoram.

      "bodyText": "Afew sprigs or a small handful of chopped herbs is the amount you'd normally expect to use in a recipe. But buy your herbs from a shop or supermarket, and such quantities will make only the merest dent in what is more often than not a large and expensive bunch or plastic packet. At 60p-\u00a31 per herb, that can end up costing as much, if not more, than the other main ingredients in a meal for which four or five herbs are required. Leftover herbs face one of two fates: either a heap of once-aromatic leaves will spend a limp week in the fridge before going in the bin; or the remains of the bunch will sit in a glass of water by the sink until the water becomes a gluey, green soup of stringy, rancid stems. But it needn't be that way. Herbs are very easy to grow at home, be that on just a window-sill or in a larger outdoor space. That's because most herbs are highly independent plants that require none of the cosseting of more rarefied species. Herbs rely for their flavour and aroma on a high distillation of essential oils, which is best achieved by growing them in full sun. However, you can still get worthwhile results in partial shade. In the wild, herbs are toughened by harsh conditions, so over-tending them in the domestic environment will only create weak plants with diminished culinary potential. You don't even need to be picky about soil types. But the one thing all herbs need is good drainage (although a few, such as mint and parsley, will tolerate moisture-retentive soil). To assess your soil's drainage capacity, pour water on to the surface until it forms a puddle - it should then disappear fairly quickly. If it does not, then improve the drainage by digging in pea shingle to break up the topsoil and speed the flow of water from the surface to the subsoil, where it will not waterlog roots. If your soil is highly acidic or an impenetrable clay pancake - common in cities, where spoil from house building constitutes the base of many a garden - or if you have no soil at all, a herb garden will do just as well in pots or raised beds. Wooden boxes, window-boxes and terracotta pots are ideal. (If you are a minimalist/modernist who insists on galvanised or stainless steel, line the container first with polystyrene sheeting to insulate the roots from extreme heat.) Put a good 6-10cm layer of drainage material (broken crock, pebbles or broken polystyrene) in the base of your chosen container, then add a mixture of 60% soil-based compost with 40% multi-purpose (also add drainage material - pea-shingle or perlite - at a rate of one good handful per spadeful of compost, to prevent the fine composts from suffocating roots.) Give your new plants space to grow, and water them well as they establish. And that's all there is to it. Honest. When planting herbs in a bed, put tall herbs such as fennel, lovage and rosemary at the back, so that they do not overshadow low-growing species such as thyme, parsley and marjoram. For a less formal approach, use your herbs to plug any gaps in an established garden, and they'll happily take up whatever space is available. However, it's best not to plant mint in open ground, as it will take over in no time, so keep it restrained, in a pot, say. In our climate, basil alone needs special attention. It loathes the wind and the wet, so, unless you can provide a really sheltered position, it is best grown on a sunny window-sill, or in a greenhouse or conservatory. It is most important that you provide a light, rich compost and water the plant at the base of its stem at midday, so that any excess water has a chance to evaporate. Basil loses its delicate sweet scent if allowed to flower or grow too large, so harvest plants when young and sow at regular intervals to maintain a crop through the summer. Perennial or woody herbs such as lavender, rosemary and sage are best purchased as small plants, whereas most other herbs can quickly be grown from seed. If you do buy your herbs as plants, get them from a nursery, where they are more likely to be well-rooted. Those pots of \"growing\" herbs you see at the supermarket are invariably crowded with shallow-rooted seedlings that, when cut, will not have the vigour to put on any further worthwhile growth.

We would expect a scientist to be able to give two sorts of explanation: one descriptive and one causal. The first would describe water as a collection of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. But that wouldn't be enough to explain our ordinary experience of water. We should further want to know why a bunch of water molecules makes a puddle rather than a lump on our kitchen floor. </p> <p>To put it spectacularly crudely, wetness is to water as consciousness is to neuronal activity in the brain. Few people these days seriously doubt that consciousness arises solely from physical activity inside our skulls. But the big question is how this happens. Why does matter arranged in this way, and not others, give rise to minds? </p> <p>This is a question that Gerard Edelman and Giulio Tononi signally fail to answer, despite the grand promise of their subtitle. Hardly surprising, since it is probably the toughest problem known to science. But they do sketch a hypothesis which, if experimentally verified, would go a long way towards answering a smaller but still important question - not how consciousness arises, but what kinds of brain activity are necessary to produce consciousness. </p> <p>Along the way they are careful mostly to avoid the sorts of materialistic canard that have enraged philosophers such as John Searle and Jerry Fodor. Consciousness, they insist, is not an object but a process. The brain is not a computer, processing encoded information - because who would have encoded the information in the first place? And crucially, the mind is not located in any particular area of the brain but is invoked by a \"dynamic core\". </p> <p>The core is an enormously complex set of neuronal interactions whose physical constitution changes from moment to moment. Perturbation of part of the core will very quickly alter its entire state, but activity outside the core (such as routines that regulate blood pressure) need not affect it at all. Such external routines, however, may still deliver results to the core: I am not aware of the firing of neurons in my visual cortex, but they enable my consciousness to recognise that this light is red. Similarly, the core may affect the rest of the brain by giving instructions for external automatic routines to begin. </p> <p>So far, so good. This hypothesis is bolstered by an idea of brain \"selectionism\". Darwinian selection occurs not only in the evolution of the human brain, argue the authors, but also within each brain over its lifetime. The more successful (more \"fit\") neuronal routines become habitually grooved circuits so as to enable certain desired practices more easily in future. </p> <p>Now hang on: who is doing the deciding? What makes certain neuronal routines fitter than others? Edelman and Tononi nominate \"value systems\". Some value systems are morphological: the fact that we have hands of a certain shape, with a propensity to grasp in a certain way, selects for certain motor routines above others when we are trying to raise a glass to our lips. Other \"values\" are provided by a large network of hormonal transmitters that, according to external stimuli, can very quickly flood the brain with, say, noradrenaline or dopamine, and thus select for different neuronal processes. </p> <p>But here we reach the crux of Consciousness. Its silence throughout on the problem of will is deafening. For how does the brain decide to do anything? How does the value system itself decide what selectional constraints it is going to impose on the rest of the brain? Sometimes Edelman and Tononi imply that we are all mere automata, as when they write carelessly that conscious states \"lead to\" behavioural outputs, or that aspects of a visual scene \"control behaviour and planning\". </p> <p>In one sense, we are indeed slaves to our own brains. In writing this review, I am a hostage to unconscious neuronal routines inside my head. I cannot decide to have a thought: I must simply sip my coffee, draw on my cigarette and have faith that one will come, delivered ribbon-wrapped to my dynamic core. Yet we are not controlled by our environment in the way that the authors sometimes seem to suggest; we can rebel against and even change it. It is hard to see, on the authors' model, where such decisions can come from. Further, there seems to be no obvious way to explain human beings' potential for maladaptive behaviours, such as smoking or suicide, unless you ascribe them to genetic defects in the hormonal value system. </p> <p>What is the intended readership of this book? Edelman and Tononi illuminate their theories with a few excellent analogies, and yet as a whole Consciousness is extremely dense, peppered with bizarre diagrams, formulae of higher maths and, at crucial explanatory points, endnote instructions to refer to their previous publications. </p> <p>As I am not a neuroscientist, I can only review Consciousness within its presumably intended genre: popular science. Well, the authors do not provide an objective survey of competitive research; their project is to promote their own work. And while they laudably insist that philosophers must base their work in neuroscience, they might have acknowledged the huge influences in the other direction. Their introductory shopping list of features of consciousness (it is unitary, coherent and private) owes everything to philosophers, yet they go on to attack philosophical straw men - hard-core Cartesians or behaviourists - who bear no relation to current work in the philosophy of mind. </p> <p>Most importantly, they claim that Schopenhauer called the problem of consciousness the \"world knot\", and adopt this lovely image as their catchphrase. But that is not what Schopenhauer said. What he calls the \"world knot\", in On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, is \"the identity of the subject of willing with that of knowing\".

But while the novel does stray occasionally towards portentousness, it is saved by passages of extraordinarily evocative, intensely imagined descriptive writing, and an authorial deftness that infuses both plot and character with wit, humour and intelligence. </p> <p>Roberts's language is almost painterly in its determination to show light and shade, revealing a densely patterned world that assails the senses: crab shins, \"flecked red and white, flaring with bristly hairs\", a long-necked woman who resembles \"a wader pecking elegantly along the shore\", blossom like \"a dream of shivery whiteness\". These picturesque fragments exist alongside an arch tale of romantic rivalry that comes close to a comedy of manners. </p> <p>The setting is provincial France shortly before the outbreak of the first world war. Genevi\u00e8ve now finds herself in a household of women covertly competing for the affections of one man. He is a poet, and the women are his mother, an English governess, his young niece and Genevi\u00e8ve herself.

Gradually, as each of them darts in front of the looking glass, their stories become mingled; the one figure we can hardly catch sight of is that of the romantic poet himself. </p> <p>Each character is beguiled by her own story, and embroiled in the business of creating a coherent narrative out of recalcitrant experience.

      "body": "<p>Allan Ahlberg tells the story of the woman who cornered Einstein at a party. \"Of course,\" said the woman airily, \"I have dozens of ideas every day.\" \"Do you?\" replied Einstein. \"I've only ever had one.\" </p> <p>Ahlberg has an abundance of ideas, as befits a man who has become one of the best-known and prolific writers for children. He keeps his in an old cigar box. But like Einstein, he is wise enough to know that it is quality and selection that really matter. \"The real skill is in the choosing which of your ideas you are going to develop. It is like being in a lifeboat and deciding which ones you are going to haul inside,\" he says. </p> <p>For the last 25 years he's been doing pretty well. Since the day that his wife Janet, an artist who died of breast cancer in 1994, asked him to come up with a story that she could illustrate, Ahlberg has been enlivening children's bedtimes with books that range from the simplicity of that nursery classic Each Peach Pear Plum, through the truthful observations of everyday school life in the poems Please Mrs Butler, to the comic delights of The Giant Baby and Woof! </p> <p>For plenty of children, books such as Peepo!, the Happy Families series and The Jolly Postman are as much a rite of passage as losing a first baby tooth or starting school - about which, incidentally, there is a lovely, witty book. </p> <p>Ahlberg, who worked as a grave-digger and for 10 years as a primary-school teacher, still doesn't feel entirely comfortable being labelled a children's writer. \"Ideally I would simply choose to be a writer. But the truth is that when I get up in the morning and sit down to write it is some kind of children's book that comes out.\" </p> <p>Or is it? Ahlberg's latest book, My Brother's Ghost, a slim 10,000 words that he describes as \"a bonsai novel\" is a marvellous evocation of a working-class 1950s childhood amid the stinking canals and factories of the Black Country, and a spine-tingling ghost story. Although I've tangible proof that the book has appeal to eight and nine-year-olds, who are drawn by its miniature format and gold-blocked binding, its spare, grave prose and aching sense of loss are entirely grown-up. </p> <p>Ahlberg agrees that there is something different about My Brother's Ghost from his previous work. \"I wrote it to please myself. I had hopes that some children would get to it and read it, but to be brutal I didn't care,\" he says, pointing out that when writing for children there is curb and restraint in the same way that if you are playing table tennis with a child, you take account of their height. </p> <p>The only restraint in My Brother's Ghost is in the delicate writing. Its emotional territory - coming to terms with death and life - is as painful as a graze of the skin. There is something quite defenceless about it. Perhaps that is because it springs from both recent hurts and older wounds. The death of his wife and collaborator, Janet, is clearly one, but Ahlberg has also dug deep into the scars of his own childhood. </p> <p>\"It is a clich\u00e9 to say that as writers get older they are drawn back to their childhoods, but I would write about that time all the time if anyone would read it,\" says Ahlberg, who was adopted as a baby. In the book, the narrator Frances and her baby brother Harry and older brother Tom, who has a fatal encounter with a milk float on page one, are orphans being brought up by their aunt Marge, a woman without maternal instinct who hits the children one minute and begs their forgiveness the next. </p> <p>\"It would be a libel to say that Auntie Marge is my mother. Working-class life was hard in those days, but my mother was more violent than many,\" recalls Ahlberg. Yet he now feels he understands her. \"We moved four times in six years. I went to four different schools. It was awful. It was only later I realised that what she was trying to do was to get us a house with an inside bathroom.\" </p> <p>The novel is littered with autobiographical references: the geography and the names of the streets are based on the town of Oldbury where Ahlberg grew up, and the cemetery in the book is the same one where he worked after A levels and where the superintendent of parks, puzzled that a lad with qualifications should work as a grave-digger, persuaded him to apply to become a teacher. </p> <p>All the best writers for children have the rare ability to recall what it felt like to be a child, but part of the pleasure and pain of My Brother's Ghost is the way those feelings are filtered through the perspective of an adult, the middle-aged Frances who is recalling events of 40 years previously. </p> <p>The result is something that is tinged not by nostalgia but an overwhelming sense of loss, made all the more poignant because it was not a happy childhood, and the crippled Frances is not a child with winning ways. </p> <p>Since he has always thought of himself as a comic writer, Ahlberg is slightly surprised to find he has written this serious book. But he believes that stories choose their own form and shape. </p> <p>\"It's like the way a piece of knitting is defined by the first row of stitches on your needle. It is the first three or four sentences that establish the feel and rhythm of a book. The assumption is that writing a story is about coherence, logic and planning.

      "body": "<p><strong>IC3: The Penguin Book of New Black Writing in Britain </strong><br>ed by Courttia Newland and Kadija Sesay <br>Hamish Hamilton, \u00a39.99, 462pp <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502417965,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Only a decade ago, publishers appeared to favour the first-generation migrant\u2019s backward glance at \u201cexotic\u201d landscapes - the Rushdies and Okris - over those writers who were black and British but whose territory was closer to home. Since the mid-1990s, that bias has been eroded, with a wave of fiction-writers joining the poets of stage and page who were so crucial in the 1980s to the revival of British poetry.</p> <p>There are many possible reasons for the belated entry of major publishers into this growing area of British creativity. The commercial successes of ventures such as X Press, launched with Victor Headley\u2019s bestselling Yardie, helped overturn lazy assumptions about which books sold and who their readers were. The Saga Prize for unpublished first novels by people of African descent gave a fillip, launching the careers of Diran Adebayo and Joanna Traynor. And while visibly successful writers breed aspirant ones, a demographic factor may also be at work: half a century after the Empire Windrush docked at Tilbury, the pioneers\u2019 children and grandchildren have a relative ease of presence, bringing increased confidence to pursue the precarious vocation of writing.</p> <p>This anthology of almost 100 contributors testifies both to the proliferation of aspiring British writers of African descent and to a growing willingness to tap that talent. Its title, IC3, is police shorthand for black (IC1, 2 and 4 being code - with scant regard for science or geography - for \u201cCaucasian\u201d, \u201cMediterranean\u201d and \u201cAsian\u201d respectively).</p> <p>In his introduction, Courttia Newland solemnly argues that IC3 is the only collective term for Britons of African descent, since \u201cblack British\u201d is \u201cpolitical and refers to Africans, Asians, West Indians, Americans and sometimes even Chinese\u201d. He could rather glory in the fertile irony of the title: its promise of a subversive and heterogeneous creativity that flies by the nets of rigid expectations, thumbing its nose at the powers that seek to define and rule.</p> <p>Sadly, the promise of the title is only partially fulfilled. Ambitious in size and scope, the book is divided into three sections, each encompassing poetry, essays, stories and memoirs. Headed \u201cSettlers\u201d, \u201cExplorers\u201d and \u201cCrusaders\u201d, the three parts are said loosely to reflect first, second and third generations, although since this is an anthology of \u201calmost exclusively brand-new black writing\u201d, those who seek a sampler of the Windrush generation\u2019s literary greats might turn instead to Onyekachi Wambu\u2019s Empire Windrush: 50 Years of Writing about Black Britain (Gollancz, 1998).</p> <p>Not only is the writing new, but many of the names are too.

      "bodyText": "IC3: The Penguin Book of New Black Writing in Britain ed by Courttia Newland and Kadija Sesay Hamish Hamilton, \u00a39.99, 462pp Buy it at BOL Only a decade ago, publishers appeared to favour the first-generation migrant\u2019s backward glance at \u201cexotic\u201d landscapes - the Rushdies and Okris - over those writers who were black and British but whose territory was closer to home. Since the mid-1990s, that bias has been eroded, with a wave of fiction-writers joining the poets of stage and page who were so crucial in the 1980s to the revival of British poetry. There are many possible reasons for the belated entry of major publishers into this growing area of British creativity. The commercial successes of ventures such as X Press, launched with Victor Headley\u2019s bestselling Yardie, helped overturn lazy assumptions about which books sold and who their readers were. The Saga Prize for unpublished first novels by people of African descent gave a fillip, launching the careers of Diran Adebayo and Joanna Traynor. And while visibly successful writers breed aspirant ones, a demographic factor may also be at work: half a century after the Empire Windrush docked at Tilbury, the pioneers\u2019 children and grandchildren have a relative ease of presence, bringing increased confidence to pursue the precarious vocation of writing. This anthology of almost 100 contributors testifies both to the proliferation of aspiring British writers of African descent and to a growing willingness to tap that talent. Its title, IC3, is police shorthand for black (IC1, 2 and 4 being code - with scant regard for science or geography - for \u201cCaucasian\u201d, \u201cMediterranean\u201d and \u201cAsian\u201d respectively). In his introduction, Courttia Newland solemnly argues that IC3 is the only collective term for Britons of African descent, since \u201cblack British\u201d is \u201cpolitical and refers to Africans, Asians, West Indians, Americans and sometimes even Chinese\u201d. He could rather glory in the fertile irony of the title: its promise of a subversive and heterogeneous creativity that flies by the nets of rigid expectations, thumbing its nose at the powers that seek to define and rule. Sadly, the promise of the title is only partially fulfilled. Ambitious in size and scope, the book is divided into three sections, each encompassing poetry, essays, stories and memoirs. Headed \u201cSettlers\u201d, \u201cExplorers\u201d and \u201cCrusaders\u201d, the three parts are said loosely to reflect first, second and third generations, although since this is an anthology of \u201calmost exclusively brand-new black writing\u201d, those who seek a sampler of the Windrush generation\u2019s literary greats might turn instead to Onyekachi Wambu\u2019s Empire Windrush: 50 Years of Writing about Black Britain (Gollancz, 1998). Not only is the writing new, but many of the names are too. Some more established poets, such as Linton Kwesi Johnson, Lemn Sissay, Patience Agbabi and Jackie Kay, are represented by previously published work. Other relatively prominent writers are featured, including Ferdinand Dennis, Buchi Emecheta, Benjamin Zephaniah and Bernardine Evaristo, and some contributors - such as Floella Benjamin - are well known, but not necessarily as writers. But this is largely a compilation of lesser-known names - with a marked absence of such heavy hitters of the second or third generation as Caryl Phillips, Fred D\u2019Aguiar or Andrea Levy. There are some excellent short stories, including Patrick Wilmot\u2019s quirkily humorous \u201cThe Train to Walthamstow\u201d, in which Ronnie the Rat observes the \u201chuman infestation\u201d of King\u2019s Cross, and \u201cMOT Time\u201d, in which Hope Massiah movingly charts an estranged daughter\u2019s discovery that her young step-mother is pregnant, while Allister Harry\u2019s \u201cT e Headmas er\u2019s Off ce\u201d (sic) sees a man return to school to confront past demons. Among memoirs, Joanna Traynor stands out for her buoyant verve and voice, as does Margaret Busby, whose light touch whets the appetite for her forthcoming memoirs. Musician Labi Siffre\u2019s meditative essay, \u201cChoosing the Stick They Beat You With\u201d, searingly contrasts his boyhood discovery of gay sexuality with how he came to an awareness - imposed by others - of being black. While the decision to classify a piece of prose as \u201cmemoir\u201d or \u201cessay\u201d seems at times puzzlingly arbitrary, some of the most engaging writing is non-fiction that takes off from a personal passion. Colin Babb\u2019s \u201cCricket, Lovely Cricket\u201d describes the importance of West Indian victories for him as a south London boy, delineating shifting identities through sporting affiliations, while Kevin Le Gendre\u2019s \u201cFather of Freeform\u201d, on unsung British jazz pioneer Joe Harriott, indicts invisibility and erasure through enthusiasm.

      "body": "<p>With <strong> Demolition Angel </strong> (Orion, \u00a312.99), Robert Crais is shooting for the big time with all guns blazing. A veteran scriptwriter who worked on LA Law and Hill Street Blues, Crais is responsible for eight Elvis Cole novels to date. This witty, inventive series, featuring a hipper-than-hip Californian private eye, last year reached a high with the moving LA Requiem. He has now set aside his trademark series and penned a big thriller-by-numbers in an attempt to conquer the bestseller lists. </p> <p>Carol Starkey was the queen of the bomb-disposal squad until an explosion that scarred her badly and killed her partner and lover: she is relegated to the sidelines, bitter and lonely. Now a bomb alert turns into a charred murder scene, and the breathless chase for the perpetrator brings her past rushing back.</p> <p>The plot ticks away like clockwork, with every ingredient carefully calibrated - the master criminal, the inevitable MacGuffin, the heroine's alcoholism and lack of love-life, the technical detail and FBI computer knowhow - but, for all its relentless pace, the book lacks soul. There is no doubt that it will be a bestseller, and so will bring many new readers to Crais. One can only hope that these converts will move on to his earlier books. Not a sell-out, just a brilliant exercise in style. </p> <p>Jeffery Deaver reached the mythical shores of film fortune with his first Lincoln Rhyme novel, The Bone Collector. He follows it with <strong> The Empty Chair </strong> (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a310), in which his paraplegic investigator returns with policewoman sidekick Amelia. Travelling to north Carolina for an operation, he is drafted in by the local cops when two women are kidnapped by a neighbourhood psychotic. Soon his world is turned upside down when Amelia joins the madman and they go on the run. His beliefs sorely questioned, Rhyme must draw on unfamiliar resources to survive and conquer. Slick, breathless stuff from a master of suspense in full flight. </p> <p>Jerry Raine is a British author who prospers within the thin ranks of domestic miserablism noir. <strong> Slaphead Chameleon </strong> (Gollancz, \u00a39.99) combines the small-time desperation of his earlier books with a glimpse into the shadowy borderlines of the music business. This is suburban crime at its most unassuming, and packs a mean punch as its unshowy virtues accumulate. Raine has a gift for recreating the ordinariness of daily crime, and much empathy for his collection of losers. </p> <p>In Marc Blake's Hiaasen-esque <strong> 24 Carat Schmooze </strong> (Flame, \u00a312), every London character is eminently dodgy.

      "bodyText": "With Demolition Angel (Orion, \u00a312.99), Robert Crais is shooting for the big time with all guns blazing. A veteran scriptwriter who worked on LA Law and Hill Street Blues, Crais is responsible for eight Elvis Cole novels to date. This witty, inventive series, featuring a hipper-than-hip Californian private eye, last year reached a high with the moving LA Requiem. He has now set aside his trademark series and penned a big thriller-by-numbers in an attempt to conquer the bestseller lists. Carol Starkey was the queen of the bomb-disposal squad until an explosion that scarred her badly and killed her partner and lover: she is relegated to the sidelines, bitter and lonely. Now a bomb alert turns into a charred murder scene, and the breathless chase for the perpetrator brings her past rushing back. The plot ticks away like clockwork, with every ingredient carefully calibrated - the master criminal, the inevitable MacGuffin, the heroine's alcoholism and lack of love-life, the technical detail and FBI computer knowhow - but, for all its relentless pace, the book lacks soul. There is no doubt that it will be a bestseller, and so will bring many new readers to Crais. One can only hope that these converts will move on to his earlier books. Not a sell-out, just a brilliant exercise in style. Jeffery Deaver reached the mythical shores of film fortune with his first Lincoln Rhyme novel, The Bone Collector. He follows it with The Empty Chair (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a310), in which his paraplegic investigator returns with policewoman sidekick Amelia. Travelling to north Carolina for an operation, he is drafted in by the local cops when two women are kidnapped by a neighbourhood psychotic. Soon his world is turned upside down when Amelia joins the madman and they go on the run. His beliefs sorely questioned, Rhyme must draw on unfamiliar resources to survive and conquer. Slick, breathless stuff from a master of suspense in full flight. Jerry Raine is a British author who prospers within the thin ranks of domestic miserablism noir. Slaphead Chameleon (Gollancz, \u00a39.99) combines the small-time desperation of his earlier books with a glimpse into the shadowy borderlines of the music business. This is suburban crime at its most unassuming, and packs a mean punch as its unshowy virtues accumulate. Raine has a gift for recreating the ordinariness of daily crime, and much empathy for his collection of losers. In Marc Blake's Hiaasen-esque 24 Carat Schmooze (Flame, \u00a312), every London character is eminently dodgy. This is a romp of a thriller with all the charm of an alligator, as it follows a band of Dickensian modern geezers through a web of extortion. Guaranteed to cheer you up and worry you no end, as you ponder the world you and Blake's characters somehow share. Lauren Henderson is the instigator of Tart Noir, a group of female crime writers with attitude (see the hilarious tartcity.com); her heroine, sculptor Sam Jones, has a knack of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and usually in the wrong outfit. Her latest caper, Chained (Hutchinson, \u00a310), is another racy set of misadventures in medialand as our involuntary sleuth gets handcuffed, beaten up and touched up - and that's only the beginning of her problems.

Alexis Lykiard's fond memoir is fascinated with the process by which authors slip out of memory, often undeservedly, and is littered with tantalising references to other vanished writers (Mina Loy, Anna Kavan), the famously overlooked (Henry Green), and those who willed themselves into obscurity through a refusal to compromise - a process Lykiard himself is qualified to write about, having abandoned his own career as a novelist.</p> <p>Writing at a difficult time - the 1960s - when the English novel was an unfashionable thing for a young man to aspire to, Lykiard also missed out on the comfortable advances and literary prizes available to the generation after him, which produced careers as secure and dull as anything in the civil service. </p> <p>Lykiard met Jean Rhys when he was a young writer in his twenties and she was getting on, reduced to fairly ghastly circumstances and stuck in a part of Devon she described as \"really one of the dullest places under heaven\". Their attraction was based on mutual exile (Lykiard had fled London for the west country) and the fact that they were both outsiders. Lykiard was Greek, filtered through public school, while Rhys had been raised in Dominica, beyond the usual constraints of English society, until sent to finish her education in England. </p> <p>Because of her late arrival, Rhys's work escaped the network of defensive irony on which so much English literature depends. Lykiard's portrait presents her as being in all respects intensely unironic, and therefore intensely difficult. Stella Bowen, the third party in the m\u00e9nage with Ford and Rhys, described her as \"a doomed soul, violent and demoralised\". The critic Claire Tomalin has marked her down as \"as much monster as victim\". </p> <p>In the current jargon, Rhys suffered from low self-esteem (\"I had a complete conviction that I was a useless person\"), dysfunctional relationships and an addictive personality. But her neuroses were prescient of today's, and the template of her novels anticipated the contemporary interior landscape. Her work also deals with sexual and financial transactions in a recognisably modern way; it is attuned to emotional short-changing and its by-products, the humiliation and excitement of masochism. No one has written so well on the nature of careless lives. </p> <p>Rhys's own sense of displacement - what Diana Trilling, in a rejoinder to the argument about her masochism, called her emotional \"isolateness\" - came out of her unsteady progress through the rackety world of the chorus line, Bohemian circles and the dubious world of masculine patronage. Her failure to adopt, and adapt to, Europe resulted in fiction that can, like her emigration, be read as a movement away from the light. Nowadays her English depressions would probably be diagnosed as seasonal affective disorder. </p> <p>Lykiard paints Rhys as a haunted figure (and as such unreasoning), who through her upbringing related to ancient local Caribbean traditions of superstition and magic. He points out how crucial the dream state was to her. Her surreality was not dissimilar to Bu\u00f1uel's in its startling juxtaposition; its collision of dreams, weather, ghostly eroticism and bourgeois reality, in the shape of money and architecture. \"One day the fierce wolf that walks by my side will spring on you and rip your abominable guts out,\" she wrote matter-of-factly in Good Morning, Midnight. </p> <p>Her work's timeless quality stands in contrast to her own life, which too often saw her stuck. In 1949 she wrote complaining that \"my bitter enemy next door\" was broadcasting that she was impersonating a dead writer called Jean Rhys, to which she added a rueful PS: \"You think: perhaps I am!\" This phantom life was given an ironic succinctness in Bowen's account of how she and Ford finally managed to get rid of Rhys - getting her \"a job to 'ghost' a book for someone on the Riviera\". </p> <p>The richness of Lykiard's book depends on it offering more than just a memoir. The danger with Rhys is that she can be downgraded into a Merchant Ivory costume piece, when, as Lykiard knows, she is better represented by Lewton and Tourneur's I Walked With a Zombie. He is alert to the sharpness of Rhys's inner voice, her psychological acuity and the torpor of her stories in contrast to the exactness of her prose; he, like Rhys, is drawn to careless lives. </p> <p>As well as being a meditation on the nature and business of writing, Jean Rhys Revisited is a piece of literary archaeology and a book of enthusiasms (Hamsun, Gissing, George Moore) that performs a useful act of referral. It is also a considered work about old age and beyond - Lykiard writes movingly about Rhys's fear of her approaching death - written by a man who was young when he knew Rhys, and is now approaching his own old age.</p>",

As a writer, his  output was fairly small, and the stories themselves are spare - honed down to a  lean perfection. It seemed that everything he had written was in the public  domain, mulled over, cherished. Then, following his death in 1988, a few more discoveries were made. The story we publish here, in a world exclusive, What  Would You Like To See?, is the last of the last.

      "trailText": "<p>Raymond Carver divided his life into two parts - Bad Raymond, the drinking  years, and Good Raymond, the later years, many of which he spent looking  back, thinking how his past might have worked out otherwise. As a writer, his  output was fairly small, and the stories themselves are spare - honed down to a  lean perfection. It seemed that everything he had written was in the public  domain, mulled over, cherished. Then, following his death in 1988, a few more discoveries were made. The story we publish here, in a world exclusive, What  Would You Like To See?, is the last of the last.

      "body": "<p>We were to have dinner with Pete Petersen and his wife, Betty, the night before our departure. Pete owned a restaurant that overlooked the highway and the Pacific Ocean. Early in the summer we had rented a furnished house from him that sat a hundred yards or so back behind the restaurant, just at the edge of the parking lot. Some nights when the wind was coming in off the ocean, we could open the front door and smell the steaks being charbroiled in the restaurant's kitchen and see the grey flume of smoke rising from the heavy brick chimney. And always, day and night, we lived with the hum of the big freezer fans in the back of the restaurant, a sound we grew used to.</p> <p>Pete's daughter, Leslie, a thin blonde woman who'd never acted very friendly, lived in a smaller house nearby that also belonged to Pete. She managed his business affairs and had already been over to take a quick inventory of everything - we had rented the house furnished, right down to bedlinen and an electric can opener - and had given us our deposit cheque back and wished us luck. She was friendly that morning. She came through the house with her clipboard and inventory list, and we exchanged pleasantries. She didn't take much time with the inventory, and she already had our deposit cheque made out.</p> <p>\"Dad's going to miss you,\" she said. \"It's funny. He's tough as shoe leather, you know, but he's going to miss you. He's said so. </p> <p>He hates to see you go. Betty, too.\" Betty was her stepmother and looked after Leslie's children when Leslie dated or went off to San Francisco for a few days with her boyfriend. Pete and Betty, Leslie and her kids, Sarah and I, we all lived behind the restaurant within sight of one another, and I'd see Leslie's kids going back and forth from their little place to Pete and Betty's. Sometimes the kids would come over to our house and ring the doorbell and stand on the step and wait. Sarah would invite them in for cookies or pound cake and let them sit at the kitchen table like grown-ups and ask about their day and take an interest in their answers.</p> <p>Our own children had left home before we moved to this northern coastal region of California. Our daughter, Cindy, was living with several other young people in a house on several rocky acres of ground outside of Ukiah, in Mendocino County. They kept bees and raised goats and chickens and sold eggs and goat's milk and jars of honey. The women worked on patchwork quilts and blankets, too, and sold those when they could. But I don't want to call it a commune. I'd have a harder time dealing with it, from what I've heard about communes, if I called it a commune, where every woman was every man's property, things like that. Say she lived with friends on a little farm where everyone shared the labour. But, so far as we knew anyway, they were not involved in organised religion or any sort of sect. </p> <p>We had not heard from her for nearly three months, except for a jar of honey arriving in the mail one day, and a patch of heavy red cloth, part of a quilt she was working on. There was a note wrapped around the jar of honey, which said:</p> <p>Dear Mom and Dad</p> <p>I sewed this myself and I put this Honey up myself. I am learning to do things here.</p> <p>Love, Cindy</p> <p>But two of Sarah's letters went unanswered, and then that fall the Jonestown thing happened and we were wild for a day or two that she could be there, for all we knew, in British Guyana. We only had a post office box number in Ukiah for her. I called the sheriff's office down there and explained the situation, and he drove out to the place to take a head count and carry a message from us. She called that night and first Sarah talked to her and wept, and then I talked to her and wept with relief. Cindy wept too. Some of her friends were down there in Jonestown. She said it was raining, and she was depressed, but the depression would pass, she said; she was where she wanted to be, and doing what she wanted to do. She'd write us a long letter and send us a picture soon.</p> <p>So when Leslie's children came to visit, Sarah always took a large and real interest in them and sat them down at the table and made them cocoa and served them cookies or pound cake and took a genuine interest in their stories.</p> <p> But we were moving, we had decided to separate. I was going to Vermont to teach for a semester in a small college and Sarah was going to take an apartment in Eureka, a nearby town. At the end of four and a half months, at the end of the college semester, then we'd take a look at things and see. There was no one else involved for either of us, thank God, and we had neither of us had anything to drink now for nearly a year, almost the amount of time we had been living in Pete's house together, and somehow there was just enough money to get me back east and to get Sarah set up in her apartment. She was already doing research and secretarial work for the history department at the college in Eureka, and if she kept the same job even, and the car, and had only herself to support, she could get by all right. We'd live apart for the semester, me on the East Coast, she on the West, and then we'd take stock, see what was what.</p> <p>While we were cleaning the house, me washing the windows and Sarah down on her hands and knees cleaning woodwork, the baseboards and corners with a pan of soapy water and an old T-shirt, Betty knocked on the door. It was a point of honour for us to clean this house and clean it well before we left. We had even taken a wire brush and scoured the bricks around the fireplace. We'd left too many houses in a hurry in the past and left them damaged or in a shambles somehow, or else left owing rent and maybe having to move our things in the middle of the night. This time it was a point of honour to leave this house clean, to leave it immaculate, to leave it in better condition even than we had found it, and after we'd set the date we were going to leave, we had set to work with a passion to erase any signs of ourselves in that house. So when Betty came to the door and knocked, we were hard at work in different rooms of <br>the house and didn't hear her at first. Then she knocked again, a little louder, and I put down my cleaning materials and came out of the bedroom.</p> <p>\"I hope I'm not disturbing you,\" she said, the colour high in her cheeks. She was a little, compact woman with blue slacks and a pink blouse that hung out over her slacks. Her hair was short and brown and she was somewhere in her late forties, younger than Pete. She had been waitressing at Pete's restaurant and was friends with Pete and his first wife, Evelyn, Leslie's mother. Then, we had been told, Evelyn, who was only fifty-four, was returning home from a shopping trip into Eureka. Just as she pulled off the highway into the parking lot behind the restaurant and headed across the lot for her own driveway, her heart stopped. The car kept going, slowly enough, but with enough momentum to knock down the little wood rail fence, cross her flower bed of azaleas, and come to a stop against the porch with Evelyn slumped behind the wheel, dead. A few months later, Pete and Betty had married, and Betty had quit waitressing and become stepmother to Leslie and grandmother to Leslie's children. Betty had been married before and had grown children living in Oregon who drove down now and then to visit. Betty and Pete had been married for five years, and from what we could observe they were happy and well suited to each other.</p> <p>\"Come in, please, Betty,\" I said. \"We're just cleaning up some around here.\" I moved aside and held the door.</p> <p>\"I can't,\" she said. \"I have the children I'm looking after today. I have to get right back. But Pete and I were wondering if you could come to dinner before you leave.\" She spoke in a quiet, shy manner and held a cigarette in her fingers. \"Friday night?\" she said. </p> <p>\"If you can.\"</p> <p>Sarah brushed her hair and came to the door. \"Betty, come in out of the cold,\" she said. The sky was grey and the wind was pushing clouds in off the sea.</p> <p>\"No, no, thank you, I can't. I left the children colouring, I have to get back. Pete and I, we just wondered if you two could come to dinner. Maybe Friday night, the night before you leave?\" She waited and looked shy. Her hair lifted in the wind and she drew on her cigarette.</p> <p>\"I'd like that very much,\" Sarah said. \"Is that all right with you, Phil? We don't have any plans, I don't think. Is it all right?\"</p> <p>\"That's very nice of you, Betty,\" I said. </p> <p>\"We'd be happy to come to dinner.\"</p> <p>\"About 7:30?\" Betty said.</p> <p>\"Seven thirty,\" Sarah said. \"This pleases us very much, Betty. More than I can say. It's very kind and thoughtful of you and Pete.\"</p> <p>Betty shook her head and was embarrassed. \"Pete said he's sorry you're leaving. He said it's been like having more family here. He said it's been an honour having you here as renters.\" She started backing down the steps. The colour was still high in her cheeks. \"Friday night, then,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Thank you, Betty, I mean that,\" Sarah said. \"Thank you again. It means a lot to us.\"</p> <p>Betty waved her hand and shook her head. Then she said, \"Until Friday, then,\" and the way in which she said it somehow made my throat tighten. I shut the door after she'd turned away, and Sarah and I looked at each other.</p> <p>\"Well,\" Sarah said, \"this is a switch, isn't it? Getting invited to dinner by our landlord instead of having to skip town and hide out somewhere.\"</p> <p>\"I like Pete,\" I said. \"He's a good man.\"</p> <p>\"Betty too,\" Sarah said. \"She's a good kind woman and I'm glad she and Pete have each other.\"</p> <p>\"Things come around sometimes,\" I said. \"Things work out.\"</p> <p>Sarah didn't say anything. She bit her lower lip for a minute. Then she went on into the back room to finish scrubbing. I sat down on the sofa and smoked a cigarette. When I'd finished, I got up and went back to the other room and my mop bucket.</p> <p>The next day, Friday, we finished cleaning the house and did most of our packing. Sarah wiped down the stove once more, put aluminium foil under the burners, and gave the counter a last going over. Our suitcases and few boxes of books stood in one corner of the living room, ready for our departure. We'd have dinner tonight with the Petersens and we'd get up the next morning and go out for coffee and breakfast. Then we'd come back and load the car; there wasn't all that much left after twenty years of moves and disorder. We'd drive to Eureka and unload the car and put things away in Sarah's efficiency apartment, which she'd rented a few days before, and then sometime before eight o'clock that night she'd drive me to the little airport where I would begin my trip east, planning to make connections with a midnight flight leaving San Francisco for Boston, and she would begin her new life in Eureka. She'd already, a month before, when we began discussing these matters, taken off her wedding ring - not so much in anger as just in sadness one night when we had been making these plans. She had worn no ring at all for a few days, and then she had bought an inexpensive little ring mounted with a turquoise butterfly because, as she said, that finger \"felt naked\". Once, some years before that, in a rage, she had twisted the wedding band off her finger and thrown it across the living room. I had been drunk and left the house and when we talked about that night a few days later and I asked about her wedding ring, she said, \"I still have it. I just put it in a drawer. You don't really think I'd throw my wedding ring away, do you?\" A little later she put it back on and she'd kept wearing it, even through the bad times, up until a month ago. She'd also stopped taking birth-control pills and had herself fitted with a diaphragm.</p> <p>So we worked that day around the house and finished the packing and the cleaning and then, a little after six o'clock, we took our showers and wiped down the shower stall again and dressed and sat in the living room, she on the sofa in a knit dress and blue scarf, her legs drawn up under her, and me in the big chair by the window. I could see the back of Pete's restaurant from where I sat, and the ocean a few miles beyond the restaurant and the meadows and the copses of trees that lay between the front window and the houses. We sat without talking. We had talked and talked and talked. Now we sat without talking and watched it turn dark outside and the smoke feather up from the restaurant chimney.</p> <p>\"Well,\" Sarah said and straightened out her legs on the sofa. She pulled her skirt down a little. She lit a cigarette. \"What time is it? Maybe we should go. They said 7.30, didn't they? What time is it?\"</p> <p>\"It's ten after seven,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Ten after seven,\" she said. \"This is the last time we'll be able to sit in the living room like this and watch it get dark. I don't want to forget this. I'm glad we have a few minutes.\"</p> <p>In a little while I got up for my coat. On my way to the bedroom I stopped at the end of the sofa where she sat and bent and kissed her on the forehead. She raised her eyes to mine after the kiss and looked at me.</p> <p>\"Bring my coat too,\" she said.</p> <p>I helped her into her coat and then we left the house and went across the lawn and the back edge of the parking lot to Pete's house. Sarah kept her hands in her pockets and <br>I smoked a cigarette as we walked. Just before we got to the gate at the little fence surrounding Pete's house, I threw down my cigarette and took Sarah's arm.</p> <p>The house was new and had been planted with a tough climbing vine that had spread over the fence. A little wooden lumberjack was nailed to the banister that ran around the porch. When the wind blew, the little man began sawing his log. He was not sawing at this moment, but I could feel the dampness in the air and I knew the wind would come soon. Potted plants were on the porch and flower beds on either side of the sidewalk, but whether they had been planted by Betty or the first wife, there was no way of telling. Some children's toys and a tricycle were on the porch. The porch light was burning, and just as we started up the steps Pete opened the door and greeted us.</p> <p> 'Come in, come in,\" he said, holding the screen door with one hand. He took Sarah's hands in his hands and then he shook hands with me. He was a tall thin man, sixty years old or so, with a full head of neatly combed grey hair. His shoulders gave the impression of bulk, but he was not heavy. He was wearing a grey Pendleton shirt, dark slacks and white shoes. Betty came to the door as well, nodding and smiling. She took our coats while Pete asked us what we'd like to drink.</p> <p>\"What can I get you?\" he said. \"Name it. If I don't have it we'll send over to the restaurant for it.\" Pete was a recovering alcoholic but kept wine and liquor around the house for guests. He'd once told me that when he'd bought his first restaurant and was cooking sixteen hours a day he drank two fifths of whiskey during those sixteen hours and was hard on his help. Now he'd quit drinking, had been hospitalised for it, we'd heard, and hadn't had a drink in six years, but like many alcoholics, he still kept it around the house.</p> <p>Sarah said she'd have a glass of white wine. I looked at her. I asked for a Coke. Pete winked at me and said: \"You want a little something in the Coke? Something to help take the dampness out of your bones?\"</p> <p>\"No thanks, Pete, but maybe you could toss a piece of lime in it, thanks,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Good fellow,\" he said. \"For me it's the only way to fly anymore.\"</p> <p>I saw Betty turn a dial on the microwave oven and push a button. Pete said, \"Betty, will you have some wine with Sarah, or what would you like, honey?\"</p> <p>\"I'll have a little wine, Pete,\" Betty said.</p> <p>\"Phil, here's your Coke,\" Pete said. \"Sarah,\" he said, and gave her a glass of wine. \"Betty. Now, there's lots more of everything. Let's go in where it's comfortable.\"</p> <p>We passed through the dining room. The table was already set with four place settings, fine china and crystal wineglasses. We went through to the living room and Sarah and I sat together on one of the sofas. Pete and Betty sat across the room on another sofa. There were bowls of cocktail nuts within reach on a coffee table, cauliflower heads, celery sticks, and a bowl of vegetable dip beside the peanuts.</p> <p>\"We're so glad you could come,\" Betty said. \"We've been looking forward to this all week.\"</p> <p>\"We're going to miss you,\" Pete said, \"and that's a fact. I hate to see you go, but I know that's life, people have to do what they have to do. I don't know how to say this, but it's been an honour having you over there in the house, you both being teachers and all. I have a great respect for education, though I don't have much myself. It's like a big family here, you know that, and we've come to look on you as part of that family. Here, here's to your health. To you,\" he said, \"and to the future.\"</p> <p>We raised our glasses and then we drank.</p> <p>\"We're so glad you feel that way,\" Sarah said. \"This is very important to us, this dinner; we've been looking forward to it more than I can tell you. It means a great deal to us.\"</p> <p>Pete said: \"We're going to miss you, that's all.\" He shook his head.</p> <p>\"It's been very, very good for us living here,\" Sarah said. \"We can't tell you.\"</p> <p>\"There was something about this fellow I liked when I first saw him,\" Pete said to Sarah. \"I'm glad I rented the house to him. You can tell a lot from a man when you first meet him. I liked this fellow of yours. You take care of him, now.\"</p> <p>Sarah reached for a celery stick. A little bell went off in the kitchen and Betty said, \"Excuse me,\" and left the room.</p> <p>\"Let me freshen those up for you,\" Pete said. He left the room with our glasses and returned in a minute with more wine for Sarah and a full glass of Coke for me. Betty began carrying in things from the kitchen to put on the dining room table. </p> <p>\"I hope you like surf and turf,\" Pete said. \"Sirloin steak and lobster tail.\"</p> <p>\"It sounds fine, it's a dream dinner,\" Sarah said.</p> <p>\"I guess we can eat now,\" Betty said. \"If you'd like to come to the table. Pete sits here always,\" Betty said. \"This is Pete's place. Phil, you sit there. Sarah, you sit there across from me.\"</p> <p>\"Man who sits at the head of the table picks up the cheque,\" Pete said and laughed.</p> <p>It was a fine dinner: green salad dotted with tiny fresh shrimp, clam chowder, lobster tail, and steak. Sarah and Betty drank wine, Pete drank mineral water, I stayed with the Coke. We talked a little about Jonestown after Pete brought it up, but I could see that conversation made Sarah nervous. Her lips paled, and I managed to steer us around to salmon fishing.</p> <p>\"I'm sorry we didn't have a chance to go out,\" Pete said. \"But the sports fisher- men aren't doing anything yet. It's only the fellows with the commercial licences that are getting them, and they're going way out. In another week or two maybe the salmon will have moved in. Anytime now, really,\" Pete said. \"But you'll be on the other side of the country then.\"</p> <p>I nodded. Sarah picked up her wineglass.</p> <p>\"I bought a hundred and fifty pounds of fresh salmon from a guy yesterday, and that's what I'm featuring on the menu over there now. Fresh salmon,\" Pete said. \"I put it right in the freezer and fresh-froze it. Fellow drove up with it in his pickup truck, an Indian, and I asked him what he was asking for it and he said $3.50 a pound. I said $3.25, and he said we had a deal. So I fresh-froze it and I have it over there on the menu right now.\"</p> <p>\"Well, this was fine,\" I said. \"I like salmon, but it couldn't have been any better than what we had here tonight. This was delicious.\"</p> <p>\"We're so glad you could come,\" Betty said.</p> <p>\"This is wonderful,\" Sarah said, \"but I don't think I've ever seen so much lobster tail and steak. I don't think I can eat all of mine.\"</p> <p>\"Whatever's left we'll put in a doggy bag for you,\" Betty said and blushed. \"Just like at the restaurant. But save room for dessert.\"</p> <p>\"Let's have coffee in the living room,\" Pete said.</p> <p>\"Pete has some slides we took when we were on our trip,\" Betty said. \"If you'd care to see them, we thought we might put up the screen after dinner.\"</p> <p>\"There's brandy for those who want it,\" Pete said. \"Betty'll have some, I know. Sarah? You'll have some. That's a good girl. It doesn't bother me a bit to have it around and have my guests drink it. Drinking's a funny thing,\" Pete said.</p> <p>We had moved back into the living room. Pete was putting up a screen and talking. \"I always keep a supply of everything on hand, as you noticed out there, but I haven't touched a drink of anything alcoholic myself for six years. Now this was after drinking more than a quart a day for ten years after I retired from the service. But I quit, God knows how, but I quit, I just quit. I turned myself over to my doctor and just said, help me, Doc. I want to get off this stuff, Doc. Can you help me? Well, he made a couple of calls. Said he knew some fellows used to have trouble with it, said there'd been a time when he'd had trouble with it, too. The next thing I knew I was on my way to an establishment down there near Santa Rosa. It was in Calistoga, California. I spent three weeks there. When I came home I was sober and the desire to drink had left me. Evelyn, that's my first wife, she met me at the door when I came home and kissed me on the lips for the first time in years. She hated alcohol. Her father and a brother both died from it. It can kill you, too, don't forget it. Well, she kissed me on the lips for the first time that night, and I haven't had a drink since I went into that place at Calistoga.\"</p> <p>Betty and Sarah were clearing the table. I sat on the sofa and smoked while Pete talked. After he'd put up the screen he took a slide projector out of a box and set it on an end table. He plugged in the cord and flicked a switch on the projector. Light beamed onto the screen and a little fan in the projector began to run.</p> <p>\"We have enough slides that we could look at pictures all night and then some,\" Pete said. \"We have slides here from Mexico, Hawaii, Alaska, the Middle East, Africa, too. What would you like to see?\"</p> <p>Sarah came in and sat down on the other end of the sofa from me.</p> <p>\"What would you like to see, Sarah?\" Pete said. \"You name it.\"</p> <p>\"Alaska,\" Sarah said. \"And the Middle East. We were there for a while, years ago, in Israel. I've always wanted to go to Alaska.\"</p> <p>\"We didn't get to Israel,\" Betty said, coming in with the coffee. \"We were on a tour that went only to Syria, Egypt, and Lebanon.\"</p> <p>\"It's a tragedy, what's happened in Lebanon,\" Pete said. \"It used to be the most beautiful country in the Middle East. I was there as a kid in the merchant marines in World War II. I thought then, I promised myself then, I'd go back there someday. And then we had the opportunity, Betty and me. Didn't we, Betty?\"</p> <p>Betty smiled and nodded.</p> <p>\"Let's see those pictures of Syria and Lebanon,\" Sarah said. \"Those are the ones I'd like to see. I'd like to see them all, of course, but if we have to choose.\"</p> <p>So Pete began to show slides, both he and Betty commenting as the memory of the places came back to them.</p> <p>\"There's Betty trying to get on a camel,\" Pete said. \"She needed a little help from that fellow there in the burnoose.\"</p> <p>Betty laughed and her cheeks turned red. Another slide flashed on the screen and Betty said, \"There's Pete talking with an Egyptian officer.\"</p> <p>\"Where he's pointing, that mountain behind us there. Here, let me see if I can bring that in closer,\" Pete said. \"The Jews are dug in there. We could see them through the binoculars they let us use. Jews all over that hill. Like ants,\" Pete said.</p> <p>\"Pete believes that if they had kept their planes out of Lebanon, there wouldn't be all that trouble there,\" Betty said. \"The poor Lebanese.\"</p> <p>\"There,\" Pete said. \"There's the group at Petra, the lost city. It used to be a caravan city, but then it was just lost, lost and covered over by sand for hundreds of years and then it was discovered again and we drove there from Damascus in Land Rovers. Look how pink the stone is. Those carvings in the stone are more than two thousand years old, they say. There used to be twenty thousand souls who lived there. And then the desert just covered it up and it was forgotten about. It's what's going to happen to this country if we aren't careful.\"</p> <p>We had more coffee and watched some more slides of Pete and Betty at the souks in Damascus. Then Pete turned off the projector and Betty went out to the kitchen and returned with carameled pears for dessert and more coffee. We ate and drank and Pete said again how they would miss us.</p> <p>\"You're good people,\" Pete said. \"I hate to see you leave, but I know it's in your best interests or you wouldn't be going. Now, you'd like to see some slides from Alaska. Is that what you said, Sarah?'</p> <p>\"Alaska, yes,\" Sarah said. \"We'd talked once about going to Alaska, years ago. Didn't we, Phil? Once we were all set to go to Alaska. But we didn't go at the last minute. Do you remember that, Phil?\"</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>\"Now you'll go to Alaska,\" Pete said.</p> <p>The first slide showed a tall, trim red-haired woman standing on the deck of a ship with a snow-covered range of mountains in the distance behind her. She was wearing a white fur coat and facing the camera with a smile on her face.</p> <p>\"That's Evelyn, Pete's first wife,\" Betty said. \"She's dead now.\"</p> <p>Pete threw another slide onto the screen. The same red-haired woman was wearing the same parka and shaking hands with a smiling Eskimo in a parka. Large dried fish were hanging on poles behind the two figures. There was an expanse of water and more mountains.</p> <p>\"That's Evelyn again,\" Pete said. \"These were taken in Point Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost settlement in the US.\"</p> <p>Then there was a shot of the main street - little low buildings with slanted metal roofs, signs saying King Salmon Cafe, Cards, Liquor, Rooms. One slide showed a Colonel Sanders fried-chicken parlour with a billboard outside showing Colonel Sanders in a parka and fur boots. We all laughed.</p> <p>\"That's Evelyn again,\" Betty said, as another slide flashed on the screen.</p> <p>\"These were made before Evelyn died,\" Pete said. \"We'd always talked about going to Alaska, too,\" Pete said. \"I'm glad we made that trip before she died.\"</p> <p>\"Good timing,\" Sarah said.</p> <p>\"Evelyn was a good friend to me,\" Betty said. \"It was a lot like losing my sister.\"</p> <p>We saw Evelyn boarding a plane back for Seattle, and we saw Pete, smiling and waving, emerging from that same plane after it had landed in Seattle.</p> <p>\"It's heating up,\" Pete said. \"I'll have to turn off the projector for a little while to let it cool off. What would you like to see then? Hawaii? Sarah, it's your night; you say.\"</p> <p>Sarah looked at me.</p> <p>\"I guess we should think about going home, Pete,\" I said. \"It's going to be a long day tomorrow.\"</p> <p>\"Yes, we should go,\" Sarah said. \"We really should, I guess.\" But she continued to sit there with her glass in her hand. She looked at Betty and then she looked at Pete. \"It's been a very wonderful evening for us,\" she said. \"I really have a hard time thanking you enough. This has meant a good deal to us.\"</p> <p>\"No, it's us who should be thanking you,\" Pete said, \"and that's the truth. It's been a pleasure knowing you. I hope that the next time you're in this part of the country you'll stop by here and say hello.\"</p> <p>\"You won't forget us?\" Betty said. \"You won't, will you?\" Sarah shook her head. Then we were on our feet and Pete was get ting our coats. Betty said, \"Oh, don't forget your doggy bag. This will make you a nice snack tomorrow.\"</p> <p>Pete helped Sarah with her coat and then held my coat for me to slip my arm into.</p> <p>We all shook hands on the front porch. \"The wind's coming up,\" Pete said. \"Don't forget us, now,\" Pete said. \"And good luck.\"</p> <p>\"We won't,\" I said. \"Thank you again, thanks for everything.\" We shook hands once more. Pete took Sarah by the shoulders and kissed her on the cheek. \"You take good care of yourselves, now. This fellow, too. Take good care of him,\" he said. \"You're both good people. We like you.\"</p> <p>\"Thank you, Pete,\" Sarah said. \"Thank you for saying that.\"</p> <p>\"I'm saying it because it's true, or else I wouldn't be saying it,\" Pete said.</p> <p>Betty and Sarah embraced.</p> <p>\"Well, good night to you,\" Betty said. \"And God bless you both.\"</p> <p>We walked down the sidewalk past the flowers. I held the gate for Sarah and we walked across the gravel parking lot to our house. The restaurant was dark. It was after midnight. Wind blew through the trees. The parking lot lights burned, and the generator in the back of the restaurant hummed and turned the freezer fan inside the locker.</p> <p>I unlocked the door to the house. Sarah snapped on the light and went into the bathroom. I turned on the lamp beside the chair in front of the window and sat down with a cigarette. After a little while Sarah came out, still in her coat, and sat on the sofa and touched her forehead.</p> <p>\"It was a nice evening,\" she said. \"I won't forget it. So different from so many of our other departures,\" she said. \"Imagine, to actually have dinner with your landlord before you move.\" She shook her head. \"We've come a long way, I guess, if you look at it that way. But there's a long way to go yet. Well, this is the last night we'll spend in this house, and I'm so tired from that big dinner I can hardly keep my eyes open. I think I'll go in and go to bed.\"</p> <p>\"I'm going too,\" I said. \"Just as soon as I finish this.\"</p> <p>We lay in bed without touching. Then Sarah turned on her side and said, \"I'd like you to hold me until I get off to sleep. That's all, just hold me. I miss Cindy tonight. I hope she's all right. I pray she's all right. God help her to find her way. And God help us,\" she said.</p> <p>After a while her breathing became slow and regular and I turned away from her again. I lay on my back and stared at the dark ceiling. I lay there and listened to the wind. Then, just as I started to close my eyes again, I heard something. Or, rather, something that I had been hearing I didn't hear anymore. The wind still blew, and I could hear it under the eaves of the house and singing in the wires outside the house, but something was not there any longer, and I didn't know what it was. I lay there a while longer and listened, and then I got up and went out to the living room and looked out the front window at the restaurant, the edge of moon showing through the fast-moving clouds.</p> <p>I stood at the window and tried to figure out what was wrong. I kept looking at the glint of ocean and then back to the darkened restaurant. Then it came to me, what the odd silence was. The generator had gone off over at the restaurant. I stood there a while longer wondering what I should do, if I should call Pete. Maybe it would take care of itself in a little while and switch back on, but for some reason I knew this wouldn't happen.</p> <p>He must have noticed it too, for suddenly I saw a light go on over at Pete's, and then a figure appeared on the steps with a flashlight. The figure carrying the flashlight went to the back of the restaurant and unlocked the door, and then lights began to go on in the restaurant. After a little while, after I had smoked a cigarette, I went back to bed. I went to sleep immediately.</p> <p>The next morning we had instant coffee, and washed the cups and packed them when we were finished. We didn't talk much. There was an appliance truck behind the restaurant, and I could see Betty and Leslie coming and going from the back door of the restaurant, carrying things in their arms. I didn't see Pete.</p> <p>We loaded the car. We would be able to carry everything into Eureka in one load, after all. I walked over to the restaurant to drop off the keys, but just as I got to the office door, it opened and Pete came out carrying a box.</p> <p>\"It's going to rot.\" he said. \"The salmon thawed out. It was just starting to freeze, then it began to thaw. I'm going to lose all this salmon. I'm going to have to give it away, get rid of it this morning. The fillets and prawns and scallops, too. Everything. The generator burned out, goddamn it.\"</p> <p>\"I'm sorry, Pete,\" I said. \"We have to go now. I wanted to give you back the keys.\"</p> <p>\"What is it?\" he said and looked at me.</p> <p>\"The house keys,\" I said. \"We're leaving now. We're on our way.\"</p> <p>\"Give them to Leslie in there,\" he said. \"Leslie takes care of the rentals. Give her your keys.\"</p> <p>\"I will, then. Good-bye, Pete. I'm sorry about this. But thanks again for everything.\"</p> <p>\"Sure,\" he said. \"Sure, don't mention it. Good luck to you. Take it easy.\" He nodded and went on over to his house with his box of fillets. I gave the keys to Leslie, said good-bye to her, and walked back to the car where Sarah was waiting.</p> <p>\"What's wrong?\" Sarah said. \"What's happened? It looked like Pete didn't have the time of day for you.\"</p> <p>\"The generator burned out last night at the restaurant and the freezer shut down and some of their meat spoiled.\"</p> <p>\"Is that it?\" she said. \"That's too bad. I'm sorry to hear it. You gave them the keys, didn't you? We've said good-bye. I guess we can go now.\"</p> <p>\"Yes,\" I said. \"I guess we can.\"</p> <p>\u00a9 Tess Gallagher, 2000.

      "bodyText": "We were to have dinner with Pete Petersen and his wife, Betty, the night before our departure. Pete owned a restaurant that overlooked the highway and the Pacific Ocean. Early in the summer we had rented a furnished house from him that sat a hundred yards or so back behind the restaurant, just at the edge of the parking lot. Some nights when the wind was coming in off the ocean, we could open the front door and smell the steaks being charbroiled in the restaurant's kitchen and see the grey flume of smoke rising from the heavy brick chimney. And always, day and night, we lived with the hum of the big freezer fans in the back of the restaurant, a sound we grew used to. Pete's daughter, Leslie, a thin blonde woman who'd never acted very friendly, lived in a smaller house nearby that also belonged to Pete. She managed his business affairs and had already been over to take a quick inventory of everything - we had rented the house furnished, right down to bedlinen and an electric can opener - and had given us our deposit cheque back and wished us luck. She was friendly that morning. She came through the house with her clipboard and inventory list, and we exchanged pleasantries. She didn't take much time with the inventory, and she already had our deposit cheque made out. \"Dad's going to miss you,\" she said. \"It's funny. He's tough as shoe leather, you know, but he's going to miss you. He's said so. He hates to see you go. Betty, too.\" Betty was her stepmother and looked after Leslie's children when Leslie dated or went off to San Francisco for a few days with her boyfriend. Pete and Betty, Leslie and her kids, Sarah and I, we all lived behind the restaurant within sight of one another, and I'd see Leslie's kids going back and forth from their little place to Pete and Betty's. Sometimes the kids would come over to our house and ring the doorbell and stand on the step and wait. Sarah would invite them in for cookies or pound cake and let them sit at the kitchen table like grown-ups and ask about their day and take an interest in their answers. Our own children had left home before we moved to this northern coastal region of California. Our daughter, Cindy, was living with several other young people in a house on several rocky acres of ground outside of Ukiah, in Mendocino County. They kept bees and raised goats and chickens and sold eggs and goat's milk and jars of honey. The women worked on patchwork quilts and blankets, too, and sold those when they could. But I don't want to call it a commune. I'd have a harder time dealing with it, from what I've heard about communes, if I called it a commune, where every woman was every man's property, things like that. Say she lived with friends on a little farm where everyone shared the labour. But, so far as we knew anyway, they were not involved in organised religion or any sort of sect. We had not heard from her for nearly three months, except for a jar of honey arriving in the mail one day, and a patch of heavy red cloth, part of a quilt she was working on. There was a note wrapped around the jar of honey, which said: Dear Mom and Dad I sewed this myself and I put this Honey up myself. I am learning to do things here. Love, Cindy But two of Sarah's letters went unanswered, and then that fall the Jonestown thing happened and we were wild for a day or two that she could be there, for all we knew, in British Guyana. We only had a post office box number in Ukiah for her. I called the sheriff's office down there and explained the situation, and he drove out to the place to take a head count and carry a message from us. She called that night and first Sarah talked to her and wept, and then I talked to her and wept with relief. Cindy wept too. Some of her friends were down there in Jonestown. She said it was raining, and she was depressed, but the depression would pass, she said; she was where she wanted to be, and doing what she wanted to do. She'd write us a long letter and send us a picture soon. So when Leslie's children came to visit, Sarah always took a large and real interest in them and sat them down at the table and made them cocoa and served them cookies or pound cake and took a genuine interest in their stories. But we were moving, we had decided to separate. I was going to Vermont to teach for a semester in a small college and Sarah was going to take an apartment in Eureka, a nearby town. At the end of four and a half months, at the end of the college semester, then we'd take a look at things and see. There was no one else involved for either of us, thank God, and we had neither of us had anything to drink now for nearly a year, almost the amount of time we had been living in Pete's house together, and somehow there was just enough money to get me back east and to get Sarah set up in her apartment. She was already doing research and secretarial work for the history department at the college in Eureka, and if she kept the same job even, and the car, and had only herself to support, she could get by all right. We'd live apart for the semester, me on the East Coast, she on the West, and then we'd take stock, see what was what. While we were cleaning the house, me washing the windows and Sarah down on her hands and knees cleaning woodwork, the baseboards and corners with a pan of soapy water and an old T-shirt, Betty knocked on the door. It was a point of honour for us to clean this house and clean it well before we left. We had even taken a wire brush and scoured the bricks around the fireplace. We'd left too many houses in a hurry in the past and left them damaged or in a shambles somehow, or else left owing rent and maybe having to move our things in the middle of the night. This time it was a point of honour to leave this house clean, to leave it immaculate, to leave it in better condition even than we had found it, and after we'd set the date we were going to leave, we had set to work with a passion to erase any signs of ourselves in that house. So when Betty came to the door and knocked, we were hard at work in different rooms of the house and didn't hear her at first. Then she knocked again, a little louder, and I put down my cleaning materials and came out of the bedroom. \"I hope I'm not disturbing you,\" she said, the colour high in her cheeks. She was a little, compact woman with blue slacks and a pink blouse that hung out over her slacks. Her hair was short and brown and she was somewhere in her late forties, younger than Pete. She had been waitressing at Pete's restaurant and was friends with Pete and his first wife, Evelyn, Leslie's mother. Then, we had been told, Evelyn, who was only fifty-four, was returning home from a shopping trip into Eureka. Just as she pulled off the highway into the parking lot behind the restaurant and headed across the lot for her own driveway, her heart stopped. The car kept going, slowly enough, but with enough momentum to knock down the little wood rail fence, cross her flower bed of azaleas, and come to a stop against the porch with Evelyn slumped behind the wheel, dead. A few months later, Pete and Betty had married, and Betty had quit waitressing and become stepmother to Leslie and grandmother to Leslie's children. Betty had been married before and had grown children living in Oregon who drove down now and then to visit. Betty and Pete had been married for five years, and from what we could observe they were happy and well suited to each other. \"Come in, please, Betty,\" I said. \"We're just cleaning up some around here.\" I moved aside and held the door. \"I can't,\" she said. \"I have the children I'm looking after today. I have to get right back. But Pete and I were wondering if you could come to dinner before you leave.\" She spoke in a quiet, shy manner and held a cigarette in her fingers. \"Friday night?\" she said. \"If you can.\" Sarah brushed her hair and came to the door. \"Betty, come in out of the cold,\" she said. The sky was grey and the wind was pushing clouds in off the sea. \"No, no, thank you, I can't. I left the children colouring, I have to get back. Pete and I, we just wondered if you two could come to dinner. Maybe Friday night, the night before you leave?\" She waited and looked shy. Her hair lifted in the wind and she drew on her cigarette. \"I'd like that very much,\" Sarah said. \"Is that all right with you, Phil? We don't have any plans, I don't think. Is it all right?\" \"That's very nice of you, Betty,\" I said. \"We'd be happy to come to dinner.\" \"About 7:30?\" Betty said. \"Seven thirty,\" Sarah said. \"This pleases us very much, Betty. More than I can say. It's very kind and thoughtful of you and Pete.\" Betty shook her head and was embarrassed. \"Pete said he's sorry you're leaving. He said it's been like having more family here. He said it's been an honour having you here as renters.\" She started backing down the steps. The colour was still high in her cheeks. \"Friday night, then,\" she said. \"Thank you, Betty, I mean that,\" Sarah said. \"Thank you again. It means a lot to us.\" Betty waved her hand and shook her head. Then she said, \"Until Friday, then,\" and the way in which she said it somehow made my throat tighten. I shut the door after she'd turned away, and Sarah and I looked at each other. \"Well,\" Sarah said, \"this is a switch, isn't it? Getting invited to dinner by our landlord instead of having to skip town and hide out somewhere.\" \"I like Pete,\" I said. \"He's a good man.\" \"Betty too,\" Sarah said. \"She's a good kind woman and I'm glad she and Pete have each other.\" \"Things come around sometimes,\" I said. \"Things work out.\" Sarah didn't say anything. She bit her lower lip for a minute. Then she went on into the back room to finish scrubbing. I sat down on the sofa and smoked a cigarette. When I'd finished, I got up and went back to the other room and my mop bucket. The next day, Friday, we finished cleaning the house and did most of our packing. Sarah wiped down the stove once more, put aluminium foil under the burners, and gave the counter a last going over. Our suitcases and few boxes of books stood in one corner of the living room, ready for our departure. We'd have dinner tonight with the Petersens and we'd get up the next morning and go out for coffee and breakfast. Then we'd come back and load the car; there wasn't all that much left after twenty years of moves and disorder. We'd drive to Eureka and unload the car and put things away in Sarah's efficiency apartment, which she'd rented a few days before, and then sometime before eight o'clock that night she'd drive me to the little airport where I would begin my trip east, planning to make connections with a midnight flight leaving San Francisco for Boston, and she would begin her new life in Eureka. She'd already, a month before, when we began discussing these matters, taken off her wedding ring - not so much in anger as just in sadness one night when we had been making these plans. She had worn no ring at all for a few days, and then she had bought an inexpensive little ring mounted with a turquoise butterfly because, as she said, that finger \"felt naked\". Once, some years before that, in a rage, she had twisted the wedding band off her finger and thrown it across the living room. I had been drunk and left the house and when we talked about that night a few days later and I asked about her wedding ring, she said, \"I still have it. I just put it in a drawer. You don't really think I'd throw my wedding ring away, do you?\" A little later she put it back on and she'd kept wearing it, even through the bad times, up until a month ago. She'd also stopped taking birth-control pills and had herself fitted with a diaphragm. So we worked that day around the house and finished the packing and the cleaning and then, a little after six o'clock, we took our showers and wiped down the shower stall again and dressed and sat in the living room, she on the sofa in a knit dress and blue scarf, her legs drawn up under her, and me in the big chair by the window. I could see the back of Pete's restaurant from where I sat, and the ocean a few miles beyond the restaurant and the meadows and the copses of trees that lay between the front window and the houses. We sat without talking. We had talked and talked and talked. Now we sat without talking and watched it turn dark outside and the smoke feather up from the restaurant chimney. \"Well,\" Sarah said and straightened out her legs on the sofa. She pulled her skirt down a little. She lit a cigarette. \"What time is it? Maybe we should go. They said 7.30, didn't they? What time is it?\" \"It's ten after seven,\" I said. \"Ten after seven,\" she said. \"This is the last time we'll be able to sit in the living room like this and watch it get dark. I don't want to forget this. I'm glad we have a few minutes.\" In a little while I got up for my coat. On my way to the bedroom I stopped at the end of the sofa where she sat and bent and kissed her on the forehead. She raised her eyes to mine after the kiss and looked at me. \"Bring my coat too,\" she said. I helped her into her coat and then we left the house and went across the lawn and the back edge of the parking lot to Pete's house. Sarah kept her hands in her pockets and I smoked a cigarette as we walked. Just before we got to the gate at the little fence surrounding Pete's house, I threw down my cigarette and took Sarah's arm. The house was new and had been planted with a tough climbing vine that had spread over the fence. A little wooden lumberjack was nailed to the banister that ran around the porch. When the wind blew, the little man began sawing his log. He was not sawing at this moment, but I could feel the dampness in the air and I knew the wind would come soon. Potted plants were on the porch and flower beds on either side of the sidewalk, but whether they had been planted by Betty or the first wife, there was no way of telling. Some children's toys and a tricycle were on the porch. The porch light was burning, and just as we started up the steps Pete opened the door and greeted us. 'Come in, come in,\" he said, holding the screen door with one hand. He took Sarah's hands in his hands and then he shook hands with me. He was a tall thin man, sixty years old or so, with a full head of neatly combed grey hair. His shoulders gave the impression of bulk, but he was not heavy. He was wearing a grey Pendleton shirt, dark slacks and white shoes. Betty came to the door as well, nodding and smiling. She took our coats while Pete asked us what we'd like to drink. \"What can I get you?\" he said. \"Name it. If I don't have it we'll send over to the restaurant for it.\" Pete was a recovering alcoholic but kept wine and liquor around the house for guests. He'd once told me that when he'd bought his first restaurant and was cooking sixteen hours a day he drank two fifths of whiskey during those sixteen hours and was hard on his help. Now he'd quit drinking, had been hospitalised for it, we'd heard, and hadn't had a drink in six years, but like many alcoholics, he still kept it around the house. Sarah said she'd have a glass of white wine. I looked at her. I asked for a Coke. Pete winked at me and said: \"You want a little something in the Coke? Something to help take the dampness out of your bones?\" \"No thanks, Pete, but maybe you could toss a piece of lime in it, thanks,\" I said. \"Good fellow,\" he said. \"For me it's the only way to fly anymore.\" I saw Betty turn a dial on the microwave oven and push a button. Pete said, \"Betty, will you have some wine with Sarah, or what would you like, honey?\" \"I'll have a little wine, Pete,\" Betty said. \"Phil, here's your Coke,\" Pete said. \"Sarah,\" he said, and gave her a glass of wine. \"Betty. Now, there's lots more of everything. Let's go in where it's comfortable.\" We passed through the dining room. The table was already set with four place settings, fine china and crystal wineglasses. We went through to the living room and Sarah and I sat together on one of the sofas. Pete and Betty sat across the room on another sofa. There were bowls of cocktail nuts within reach on a coffee table, cauliflower heads, celery sticks, and a bowl of vegetable dip beside the peanuts. \"We're so glad you could come,\" Betty said. \"We've been looking forward to this all week.\" \"We're going to miss you,\" Pete said, \"and that's a fact. I hate to see you go, but I know that's life, people have to do what they have to do. I don't know how to say this, but it's been an honour having you over there in the house, you both being teachers and all. I have a great respect for education, though I don't have much myself. It's like a big family here, you know that, and we've come to look on you as part of that family. Here, here's to your health. To you,\" he said, \"and to the future.\" We raised our glasses and then we drank. \"We're so glad you feel that way,\" Sarah said. \"This is very important to us, this dinner; we've been looking forward to it more than I can tell you. It means a great deal to us.\" Pete said: \"We're going to miss you, that's all.\" He shook his head. \"It's been very, very good for us living here,\" Sarah said. \"We can't tell you.\" \"There was something about this fellow I liked when I first saw him,\" Pete said to Sarah. \"I'm glad I rented the house to him. You can tell a lot from a man when you first meet him. I liked this fellow of yours. You take care of him, now.\" Sarah reached for a celery stick. A little bell went off in the kitchen and Betty said, \"Excuse me,\" and left the room. \"Let me freshen those up for you,\" Pete said. He left the room with our glasses and returned in a minute with more wine for Sarah and a full glass of Coke for me. Betty began carrying in things from the kitchen to put on the dining room table. \"I hope you like surf and turf,\" Pete said. \"Sirloin steak and lobster tail.\" \"It sounds fine, it's a dream dinner,\" Sarah said. \"I guess we can eat now,\" Betty said. \"If you'd like to come to the table. Pete sits here always,\" Betty said. \"This is Pete's place. Phil, you sit there. Sarah, you sit there across from me.\" \"Man who sits at the head of the table picks up the cheque,\" Pete said and laughed. It was a fine dinner: green salad dotted with tiny fresh shrimp, clam chowder, lobster tail, and steak. Sarah and Betty drank wine, Pete drank mineral water, I stayed with the Coke. We talked a little about Jonestown after Pete brought it up, but I could see that conversation made Sarah nervous. Her lips paled, and I managed to steer us around to salmon fishing. \"I'm sorry we didn't have a chance to go out,\" Pete said. \"But the sports fisher- men aren't doing anything yet. It's only the fellows with the commercial licences that are getting them, and they're going way out. In another week or two maybe the salmon will have moved in. Anytime now, really,\" Pete said. \"But you'll be on the other side of the country then.\" I nodded. Sarah picked up her wineglass. \"I bought a hundred and fifty pounds of fresh salmon from a guy yesterday, and that's what I'm featuring on the menu over there now. Fresh salmon,\" Pete said. \"I put it right in the freezer and fresh-froze it. Fellow drove up with it in his pickup truck, an Indian, and I asked him what he was asking for it and he said $3.50 a pound. I said $3.25, and he said we had a deal. So I fresh-froze it and I have it over there on the menu right now.\" \"Well, this was fine,\" I said. \"I like salmon, but it couldn't have been any better than what we had here tonight. This was delicious.\" \"We're so glad you could come,\" Betty said. \"This is wonderful,\" Sarah said, \"but I don't think I've ever seen so much lobster tail and steak. I don't think I can eat all of mine.\" \"Whatever's left we'll put in a doggy bag for you,\" Betty said and blushed. \"Just like at the restaurant. But save room for dessert.\" \"Let's have coffee in the living room,\" Pete said. \"Pete has some slides we took when we were on our trip,\" Betty said. \"If you'd care to see them, we thought we might put up the screen after dinner.\" \"There's brandy for those who want it,\" Pete said. \"Betty'll have some, I know. Sarah? You'll have some. That's a good girl. It doesn't bother me a bit to have it around and have my guests drink it. Drinking's a funny thing,\" Pete said. We had moved back into the living room. Pete was putting up a screen and talking. \"I always keep a supply of everything on hand, as you noticed out there, but I haven't touched a drink of anything alcoholic myself for six years. Now this was after drinking more than a quart a day for ten years after I retired from the service. But I quit, God knows how, but I quit, I just quit. I turned myself over to my doctor and just said, help me, Doc. I want to get off this stuff, Doc. Can you help me? Well, he made a couple of calls. Said he knew some fellows used to have trouble with it, said there'd been a time when he'd had trouble with it, too. The next thing I knew I was on my way to an establishment down there near Santa Rosa. It was in Calistoga, California. I spent three weeks there. When I came home I was sober and the desire to drink had left me. Evelyn, that's my first wife, she met me at the door when I came home and kissed me on the lips for the first time in years. She hated alcohol. Her father and a brother both died from it. It can kill you, too, don't forget it. Well, she kissed me on the lips for the first time that night, and I haven't had a drink since I went into that place at Calistoga.\" Betty and Sarah were clearing the table. I sat on the sofa and smoked while Pete talked. After he'd put up the screen he took a slide projector out of a box and set it on an end table. He plugged in the cord and flicked a switch on the projector. Light beamed onto the screen and a little fan in the projector began to run. \"We have enough slides that we could look at pictures all night and then some,\" Pete said. \"We have slides here from Mexico, Hawaii, Alaska, the Middle East, Africa, too. What would you like to see?\" Sarah came in and sat down on the other end of the sofa from me. \"What would you like to see, Sarah?\" Pete said. \"You name it.\" \"Alaska,\" Sarah said. \"And the Middle East. We were there for a while, years ago, in Israel. I've always wanted to go to Alaska.\" \"We didn't get to Israel,\" Betty said, coming in with the coffee. \"We were on a tour that went only to Syria, Egypt, and Lebanon.\" \"It's a tragedy, what's happened in Lebanon,\" Pete said. \"It used to be the most beautiful country in the Middle East. I was there as a kid in the merchant marines in World War II. I thought then, I promised myself then, I'd go back there someday. And then we had the opportunity, Betty and me. Didn't we, Betty?\" Betty smiled and nodded. \"Let's see those pictures of Syria and Lebanon,\" Sarah said. \"Those are the ones I'd like to see. I'd like to see them all, of course, but if we have to choose.\" So Pete began to show slides, both he and Betty commenting as the memory of the places came back to them. \"There's Betty trying to get on a camel,\" Pete said. \"She needed a little help from that fellow there in the burnoose.\" Betty laughed and her cheeks turned red. Another slide flashed on the screen and Betty said, \"There's Pete talking with an Egyptian officer.\" \"Where he's pointing, that mountain behind us there. Here, let me see if I can bring that in closer,\" Pete said. \"The Jews are dug in there. We could see them through the binoculars they let us use. Jews all over that hill. Like ants,\" Pete said. \"Pete believes that if they had kept their planes out of Lebanon, there wouldn't be all that trouble there,\" Betty said. \"The poor Lebanese.\" \"There,\" Pete said. \"There's the group at Petra, the lost city. It used to be a caravan city, but then it was just lost, lost and covered over by sand for hundreds of years and then it was discovered again and we drove there from Damascus in Land Rovers. Look how pink the stone is. Those carvings in the stone are more than two thousand years old, they say. There used to be twenty thousand souls who lived there. And then the desert just covered it up and it was forgotten about. It's what's going to happen to this country if we aren't careful.\" We had more coffee and watched some more slides of Pete and Betty at the souks in Damascus. Then Pete turned off the projector and Betty went out to the kitchen and returned with carameled pears for dessert and more coffee. We ate and drank and Pete said again how they would miss us. \"You're good people,\" Pete said. \"I hate to see you leave, but I know it's in your best interests or you wouldn't be going. Now, you'd like to see some slides from Alaska. Is that what you said, Sarah?' \"Alaska, yes,\" Sarah said. \"We'd talked once about going to Alaska, years ago. Didn't we, Phil? Once we were all set to go to Alaska. But we didn't go at the last minute. Do you remember that, Phil?\" I nodded. \"Now you'll go to Alaska,\" Pete said. The first slide showed a tall, trim red-haired woman standing on the deck of a ship with a snow-covered range of mountains in the distance behind her. She was wearing a white fur coat and facing the camera with a smile on her face. \"That's Evelyn, Pete's first wife,\" Betty said. \"She's dead now.\" Pete threw another slide onto the screen. The same red-haired woman was wearing the same parka and shaking hands with a smiling Eskimo in a parka. Large dried fish were hanging on poles behind the two figures. There was an expanse of water and more mountains. \"That's Evelyn again,\" Pete said. \"These were taken in Point Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost settlement in the US.\" Then there was a shot of the main street - little low buildings with slanted metal roofs, signs saying King Salmon Cafe, Cards, Liquor, Rooms. One slide showed a Colonel Sanders fried-chicken parlour with a billboard outside showing Colonel Sanders in a parka and fur boots. We all laughed. \"That's Evelyn again,\" Betty said, as another slide flashed on the screen. \"These were made before Evelyn died,\" Pete said. \"We'd always talked about going to Alaska, too,\" Pete said. \"I'm glad we made that trip before she died.\" \"Good timing,\" Sarah said. \"Evelyn was a good friend to me,\" Betty said. \"It was a lot like losing my sister.\" We saw Evelyn boarding a plane back for Seattle, and we saw Pete, smiling and waving, emerging from that same plane after it had landed in Seattle. \"It's heating up,\" Pete said. \"I'll have to turn off the projector for a little while to let it cool off. What would you like to see then? Hawaii? Sarah, it's your night; you say.\" Sarah looked at me. \"I guess we should think about going home, Pete,\" I said. \"It's going to be a long day tomorrow.\" \"Yes, we should go,\" Sarah said. \"We really should, I guess.\" But she continued to sit there with her glass in her hand. She looked at Betty and then she looked at Pete. \"It's been a very wonderful evening for us,\" she said. \"I really have a hard time thanking you enough. This has meant a good deal to us.\" \"No, it's us who should be thanking you,\" Pete said, \"and that's the truth. It's been a pleasure knowing you. I hope that the next time you're in this part of the country you'll stop by here and say hello.\" \"You won't forget us?\" Betty said. \"You won't, will you?\" Sarah shook her head. Then we were on our feet and Pete was get ting our coats. Betty said, \"Oh, don't forget your doggy bag. This will make you a nice snack tomorrow.\" Pete helped Sarah with her coat and then held my coat for me to slip my arm into. We all shook hands on the front porch. \"The wind's coming up,\" Pete said. \"Don't forget us, now,\" Pete said. \"And good luck.\" \"We won't,\" I said. \"Thank you again, thanks for everything.\" We shook hands once more. Pete took Sarah by the shoulders and kissed her on the cheek. \"You take good care of yourselves, now. This fellow, too. Take good care of him,\" he said. \"You're both good people. We like you.\" \"Thank you, Pete,\" Sarah said. \"Thank you for saying that.\" \"I'm saying it because it's true, or else I wouldn't be saying it,\" Pete said. Betty and Sarah embraced. \"Well, good night to you,\" Betty said. \"And God bless you both.\" We walked down the sidewalk past the flowers. I held the gate for Sarah and we walked across the gravel parking lot to our house. The restaurant was dark. It was after midnight. Wind blew through the trees. The parking lot lights burned, and the generator in the back of the restaurant hummed and turned the freezer fan inside the locker. I unlocked the door to the house. Sarah snapped on the light and went into the bathroom. I turned on the lamp beside the chair in front of the window and sat down with a cigarette. After a little while Sarah came out, still in her coat, and sat on the sofa and touched her forehead. \"It was a nice evening,\" she said. \"I won't forget it. So different from so many of our other departures,\" she said. \"Imagine, to actually have dinner with your landlord before you move.\" She shook her head. \"We've come a long way, I guess, if you look at it that way. But there's a long way to go yet. Well, this is the last night we'll spend in this house, and I'm so tired from that big dinner I can hardly keep my eyes open. I think I'll go in and go to bed.\" \"I'm going too,\" I said. \"Just as soon as I finish this.\" We lay in bed without touching. Then Sarah turned on her side and said, \"I'd like you to hold me until I get off to sleep. That's all, just hold me. I miss Cindy tonight. I hope she's all right. I pray she's all right. God help her to find her way. And God help us,\" she said. After a while her breathing became slow and regular and I turned away from her again. I lay on my back and stared at the dark ceiling. I lay there and listened to the wind. Then, just as I started to close my eyes again, I heard something. Or, rather, something that I had been hearing I didn't hear anymore. The wind still blew, and I could hear it under the eaves of the house and singing in the wires outside the house, but something was not there any longer, and I didn't know what it was. I lay there a while longer and listened, and then I got up and went out to the living room and looked out the front window at the restaurant, the edge of moon showing through the fast-moving clouds. I stood at the window and tried to figure out what was wrong. I kept looking at the glint of ocean and then back to the darkened restaurant. Then it came to me, what the odd silence was. The generator had gone off over at the restaurant. I stood there a while longer wondering what I should do, if I should call Pete. Maybe it would take care of itself in a little while and switch back on, but for some reason I knew this wouldn't happen. He must have noticed it too, for suddenly I saw a light go on over at Pete's, and then a figure appeared on the steps with a flashlight. The figure carrying the flashlight went to the back of the restaurant and unlocked the door, and then lights began to go on in the restaurant. After a little while, after I had smoked a cigarette, I went back to bed. I went to sleep immediately. The next morning we had instant coffee, and washed the cups and packed them when we were finished. We didn't talk much. There was an appliance truck behind the restaurant, and I could see Betty and Leslie coming and going from the back door of the restaurant, carrying things in their arms. I didn't see Pete. We loaded the car. We would be able to carry everything into Eureka in one load, after all. I walked over to the restaurant to drop off the keys, but just as I got to the office door, it opened and Pete came out carrying a box. \"It's going to rot.\" he said. \"The salmon thawed out. It was just starting to freeze, then it began to thaw. I'm going to lose all this salmon. I'm going to have to give it away, get rid of it this morning. The fillets and prawns and scallops, too. Everything. The generator burned out, goddamn it.\" \"I'm sorry, Pete,\" I said. \"We have to go now. I wanted to give you back the keys.\" \"What is it?\" he said and looked at me. \"The house keys,\" I said. \"We're leaving now. We're on our way.\" \"Give them to Leslie in there,\" he said. \"Leslie takes care of the rentals. Give her your keys.\" \"I will, then. Good-bye, Pete. I'm sorry about this. But thanks again for everything.\" \"Sure,\" he said. \"Sure, don't mention it. Good luck to you. Take it easy.\" He nodded and went on over to his house with his box of fillets. I gave the keys to Leslie, said good-bye to her, and walked back to the car where Sarah was waiting. \"What's wrong?\" Sarah said. \"What's happened? It looked like Pete didn't have the time of day for you.\" \"The generator burned out last night at the restaurant and the freezer shut down and some of their meat spoiled.\" \"Is that it?\" she said. \"That's too bad. I'm sorry to hear it. You gave them the keys, didn't you? We've said good-bye. I guess we can go now.\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"I guess we can.\" \u00a9 Tess Gallagher, 2000.

      "body": "<p>A recent survey showed that two-thirds of the British public still profess to believe in God, although the church's own statistics indicate that rather fewer than one in 10 of us actually make it there on a Sunday. If there is a spiritual hunger - and periodic spasms of national emotion, such as the one following the death of Princess Diana, appear to indicate that there is - then it is of a peculiarly shallow and sentimental kind, and religion has little to do with it. </p> <p>To be sure, the Anglican church remains Established. Mrs Parker Bowles only has to swim into the public ken for the Archbishop of Canterbury to hasten round to her house to ascertain her true intentions. But in the UK, Christianity appears to be fighting a losing battle with modern life and materialism.</p> <p>Attendances are in sufficient freefall for the Church's leading statistician to predict that if current trends continue, in 40 years' time there will be no one in the pews at all. The American evangelist Louis Palau has gone so far as to describe Britain as a pagan country, but then he hopes to entice us to his rallies. We pagans nevertheless continue to publish religious books rather as Americans do self-improvement manuals. Dozens of new titles cross the desk each week, but do any of them help? What comfort do they offer for a faltering faith? </p> <p>I looked forward to seeing Cardinal Hume's last thoughts, now published as The Mystery of Love (Darton Longman Todd, \u00a39.95), in the hope that such a saintly figure would put me on the Path. The 94-page book contains the Cardinal's final thoughts for homilies and prayers, including perhaps his last meditation - written in the days before his death a year ago - on the opening sentences of the Lord's Prayer.</p> <p>Alas, they are hard going; not in the sense of being intellectually or theologically demanding, but in that the rather trite gobbets look like notes for a sermon and read like aphorisms from a devout Christmas cracker. \"Reading and reflecting, either alone or with others, on passages from the Gospel leads to our focusing our minds on Christ, his words and actions. It is the discovering of a friend. It is the beginning of prayer,\" reads one typical passage from the great spiritual leader. </p> <p>Little help there, unless for the devout of a particular bent of mind. What of A Time To Heal (Church House, \u00a39.95)? This is the Church of England's latest publication, the outcome of two years' study by a working party considering the healing ministry, advising churches and their congregations how to help those sore oppressed and in need of spiritual, perhaps even medical, advice.</p> <p>This is not an easy read either, more because of its committee-constructed prose than its spiritual insights, although these too are muddled. In a fashion that goes beyond parody of modern Anglicanism, the working party can't make up its mind whether the church still believes in miracles or not and ends up recommending that those who believe they have been on the receiving end of one should go on taking the tablets. </p> <p>If the healing ministry handbook illustrates some of the weaknesses of the current church, Monica Furlong's C of E: The State It's In (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a318.99) provides a quite devastating analysis of a church in theological, spiritual and organisational palsy - and this is written by a supporter. It is an essential handbook to the shortcomings of a Church of England hamstrung by its past, frozen by its current position and riddled by the arguments and divisions that have characterised the last few decades. </p> <p>Furlong follows the church's history, from the great schism of the Reformation and the Elizabethan settlement, through the rise of Methodism and the Oxford Movement, to such modern milestones as the Crockford preface row and the Church Commissioners' scandal - when, in the early 1990s, the church succeeded in losing at least \u00a3500m through ill-advised property speculation.</p> <p>She shows a church paved with good intentions - to which she pays due tribute - but also an institution on the rack. It \"often shrinks from doing what it knows it should,\" she writes, \"because it dreads public scorn as well as internal dissension... it vacillates, goes forward, backslides, plays safe and makes itself morally contemptible as it defends itself by claiming that it is holding dissentient voices within it when it is simply frightened to make up its mind. Expediency too often is all.\"</p> <p>It is a good job that the book was already at the printers when the church's latest wheeze - the summoning of focus groups to tell it what it was doing wrong - was unveiled at this February's Synod. The 70 Midlanders asked to speak for the nation told Church House that services were boring and went on too long, that the vestments were off-putting and that the personalities most associated with the C of E were Thora Hird and Cliff Richard (the latter scarcely a voice for youth, since he is only five years younger than the Archbishop of Canterbury). Previous generations of churchmen would have had a short way with focus groups. </p> <p>Sex, or what priests tend to call the genital problem, has dominated church debate since the sexual revolution. The Church of England remains convulsed over women priests and homosexual clergy; Catholicism has the same problem. Its attempt to liberalise with the Vatican Council in 1963 occurred - whether through an accident of timing or divine providence - between the trial of Lady Chatterley and the Beatles' first LP, a fact unaccountably overlooked by Philip Larkin. If the Church of Rome has not suffered the rows and schisms experienced by Anglicanism, that is only because the Pope has no truck with democracy, as expressed by the C of E at its biannual synod. </p> <p>Catholic women, like their C of E sisters, are on the march - though they have further to go, given that the Pope believes they are incapable of becoming priests. Paradoxically, as Nick Baty points out in Archbishop Cormac and the 21st Century Church (HarperCollins, \u00a38.99), the Catholic church in England has remained relatively relaxed about homosexuality. Baty quotes one gay priest as asserting that up to 40 per cent of his colleagues are gay. Is this absence of angst because of the celibacy rule or because the church, in England at least, has adopted a relatively tolerant attitude to the sinners if not the sin? </p> <p>Ostensibly a biography of Cardinal Hume's successor, Baty's book does for Catholicism what Furlong does for Anglicanism. Hitting the bookshelves only three months after the new archbishop was plucked from the decent obscurity of the bishopric of Arundel and Brighton, the book has limited things to say about the man who will be the de facto leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales for the next seven years. This is partly because Archbishop Cormac has hitherto led a blameless life (given to rugby and Gilbert and Sullivan in his youth, and now to golf and classical music), and partly because the over-zealous guardians of his office refused to allow the author in to interview the new man. </p> <p> The biography part thus peters out after about 40 pages, leaving a lengthy survey of the problems facing British Catholicism. Here, too, congregations have been on the slide, though the new archbishop has countered that those who do attend are more committed than the multitudes used to be. This is, however, one of the problems the next Pope will have to solve.</p> <p>For clues as to who that might be, see The Next Pope (HarperCollins, \u00a36.99), updated and reissued six years after the death of co-author Peter Hebblethwaite by his widow, Margaret. This will become essential reading for those of us heading Vatican-wards in due course to watch for the puff of white smoke declaring that a new Pope has been chosen. </p> <p>For a broader outlook, Christianity: A Global History (Allen Lane, \u00a325) modestly seeks to encompass a global survey within 600 pages. Its author, David Chidester, is an American theology professor, now head of religious studies at Cape Town University. Like so many American academic studies, it accrues a thicket of facts through which it is difficult to discern the trees of spiritual and social development by which the religion has grown over 2,000 years. It is closely focused, but rather short on analysis or discernment. </p> <p>Christ's life is dismissed in one paragraph on page 12; we then get an uneven route march through the development of Christian thought. Chidester barely mentions the Inquisition, or the English Reformation that sparked Protestantism in the Anglophone world. He does not notice Darwinism or the theory of evolution, which caused such a convulsion in belief in the 19th century and has repercussions today in American fundamentalism. There is no Bede, no Cranmer and virtually no hint of the dissensions that play such a large part in current Christianity. The author's eclecticism is such that Jack T Chick - distributor of Christian comics - gets as weighty a reference as Pope John Paul II. </p> <p>Generally, sources are undifferentiated and given equal weight. The Gospels are taken as gospel and, even where the author is sceptical about a source, he still cites it as though it were genuine. The book is, however, useful in shifting the emphasis in Christianity's history away from Europe and across the world, to the Americas and Africa. As Chidester points out, when Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic in 1492, fewer than 20 per cent of the world's population was Christian and nearly all those who were lived in Europe. Now, 33 per cent of the world is Christian and 77 per cent of the global population has at least been in contact with some form of Christianity. Here then is a paradox: a worldwide success that, in its English incarnation, needs focus groups to explain where it is going wrong.
